			<p>Half-Life 3 is a game that no fan of the series thought would ever see the light of day. Although the game hasn't been revealed yet, there have been <a href="https://wccftech.com/half-life-3-playtested-summer-reveal/"><strong>numerous indications over the past few months that Valve may be working on a new entry in the series</strong></a>. However, if the wait for an announcement is becoming unbearable, you can get a glimpse of the potential future of the series in a new look at the impressive <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-half-life-2-rtx-demo-is-an-excellent-showcase-of-rtx-remixs-possibilities/"><strong>Half-Life 2 RTX Remix mod</strong></a>.</p>



<p>A new look at one of the most impressive modding projects, powered by NVIDIA's modding tool, was provided a few days ago by a new comparison video from <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://www.youtube.com/@MxBenchmarkPC"><strong data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(26, 87, 132, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(26, 87, 132, 0.2)">MxBench</strong><strong>m</strong><strong data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(26, 87, 132, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(26, 87, 132, 0.2)">arkPC</strong></a>. The video compares the vanilla release with the latest version of the project, which incorporates significant improvements over its initial launch.</p>



<p>Although the performance hit on an RTX 5080 GPU is considerable, the new PBR assets, GPU and CPU performance improvements, lighting enhancements, improved volumetric fog and water, and the new tonemapper which prevents image from being too bright make this mod worth a try for fans of the series who want to experience the game like never before.</p>

<p>As mentioned above, Half-Life 3 is no longer a fever dream of fans of the series, but a concrete possibility. Although the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed"><a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/half-life-3-hopes-reignited-insiders-suggest-its-announcement-is-still-coming/">rumored 2025 announcement</a></strong> of the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><a data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" href="https://wccftech.com/half-life-3-hlx-optimization/">project known as HLX</a></strong> may not materialize, <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/half-life-3-hlx-end-of-development/">Valve is undoubtedly actively working on it</a></strong>, adding new features to the Source 2 engine over the past few months that will likely be incorporated into the game. Some of these will reportedly make <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed"><a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/half-life-3-is-reportedly-getting-announced-soon-but-how-will-it-play/">Half-Life 3 a very immersive experience</a></strong> that should make the wait since the launch of Half-Life:Alyx well worth it.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/seagates-8tb-external-hard-drive-at-under-0-02-per-gb-is-practically-the-cheapest-data-storage-available-2000651777</link>
            <guid>1378231</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Storage problems aren’t just annoying; they also keep you from delivering your best. Constantly deleting old files to make room for new ones, or spreading essential files across multiple devices, is not fun. Thankfully, there’s a way to resolve the issue, and right now, it doesn’t cost a lot either.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6319/">We just spotted the 8TB Seagate external hard drive sitting at $150 at Amazon, after the retailer took 12% off its $170 tag.</a> Shipping is free for both Prime and non-Prime members, so you’re saving a bit on that front too, which brings the total down even further.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6319/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Incredibly Spacious</h2>
<p>The drive itself is not massive. At just 2.5 inches, it fits nicely into any desktop setup without demanding too much space or attention. It’s also quite lightweight, which makes it easy to take your entire library with you on the go; just plug the drive into another laptop or PC, and access all your important files just like you would on your everyday computer.</p>
<p>As for the storage – it’s truly massive. The drive’s 8GB capacity is spacious enough for you to house all important data, whether it’s media content or work documents. You will be able to throw in thousands of images, hundreds of high-quality videos, a ton of movies (both the latest releases and some classics), long research papers, never-ending spreadsheets, your favorite gaming titles, and still have space for more. Basically, it can hold all that you currently own, plus all your future downloads. This capacity makes it great for creatives looking to keep all their heavy projects in one place, work professionals with years’ worth of data, and even students. You really won’t need to invest in another storage solution anytime soon.</p>



<p>Setting things up and getting started couldn’t be simpler. All you need to do is connect the USB hard drive to Windows or a Mac. There are no software or driver installations to worry about, but Apple users might need to reformat the drive to proceed. Once it’s connected to your device, moving files around takes minutes. That’s thanks to USB 3.0, plus the drag-and-drop functionality. Simply pick what you need to transfer and drop it in the drive; no need to click endless buttons.</p>
<p>The box includes the drive itself, an 18-inch USB 3.0 cable, an 18W power adapter, and Rescue Data Recovery Services. The rescue service helps you get back your lost data from the hard drive if it fails or gets damaged; great for some extra peace of mind. This can be done by shipping your device to recovery specialists, who are pros at handling both mechanical and logical (file system) data issues. There’s also a limited warranty thrown in with your purchase.</p>
<p>All in all, if you’ve been looking for a spacious drive that is capable of housing all your data, from media files to programs, work documents, creative projects, games, and more, look no further, as this 8TB is an excellent option to consider. If you’re looking for even more space, there are several other configurations available to consider, but not all are discounted. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6319/">The current 12% discount on this one brings the price down to $150, making the upgrade affordable.</a> Grab it quick, though, as deals around this time of the year tend to move fast, and deals don’t stick around for long. You’re saving on delivery fees, which is another nice bonus.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[The Hundred Line: Last Defense Academy: The Kotaku Review]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/the-hundred-line-last-defense-academy-the-kotaku-review-2000651792</link>
            <guid>1378228</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <p><span>Over the past year,&nbsp; I have spent at least three individual nights yelling over the din of a loud New York City bar to </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/games-to-play-with-friends-multiplayer-how-to-sell-1851576183"><span>try and sell someone</span></a><span> on </span><i><span>The Hundred Line: Last Defense Academy</span></i><span>. Too Kyo Games’ passion project visual novel/tactics RPG hybrid is the kind of thing that you can easily convince someone is impressive, but getting anyone to get over the hump of its magnitude and actually play it is something that still eludes me as we approach the end of the year. I think at a certain point, I accepted that as long as I could get someone to respect </span><i><span>The Hundred Line</span></i><span>, that was enough for me. If anything, I consider the fact that it’s such a hard sell to some people a testament to its accomplishments.</span></p> <p><i><span>The Hundred Line: Last Defense Academy</span></i><span> might sound like too large an undertaking for the average person, even someone who might be interested in its bold premise. But even if you don’t get around to it, know that even the most celebrated games will never be as daring as Too Kyo Games’ </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/hundred-line-last-defense-academy-too-kyo-bankrupt-1851786150"><span>incredible Hail Mary</span></a><span>.</span></p>

 <p><span>Like most works by </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/the-best-danganronpa-game-is-getting-an-enhanced-remake-with-a-twist-2000625415"><i><span>Danganronpa</span></i></a> <span>lead Kazutaka Kodaka, </span><i><span>The Hundred Line </span></i><span>follows a group of high school students trapped within the walls of an academy. Though they’re not in a killing game like the unfortunate stars of Kodaka’s signature series (at least, not initially), the group of oddballs, freaks, and like, one or two normal teenagers are caught up in a violent scheme against their will. These kids are told that they’re here to defend the titular school from waves of alien invaders because </span><i><span>something</span></i><span> within its walls is a key to saving humanity, but before they can inquire further, their captor, Sirei, a ghost-like mascot character who’s obviously taking notes from </span><i><span>Danganronpa</span></i><span>’s Monokuma, is found sliced up in a trash can just off campus.</span></p>

 <p><span>Now these kids are stuck defending this school for 100 days and without any clarity. The three months and change pass with them all having to find the strength to fight for something they don’t know if they truly believe in, as they instead find belief in one another to get them through.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><i><span>The Hundred Line’s </span></i><span>100 days are filled with silly antics, tragic breakdowns, and </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/shuten-order-review-kodaka-danganronpa-hundred-line-2000621052"><span>compelling mysteries</span></a><span>. This is every signature pillar Kodaka has skillfully mastered over the years of creating high school whodunnits, all wrapped into a three-month timespan. Each day as the clock ticks down, a new clue to what actually brought these kids to the Last Defense Academy is unearthed, and with every passing night, a sense of dread lingers over even the smallest interactions. Is everyone here trustworthy? Is everything as simple as it seems? If you know Kodaka’s work, you know the answer is “no,” but even a knowledge of murder mysteries like </span><i><span>Danganronpa </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Master Detective Archives: Rain Code </span></i><span>as well as the cyberpunk dystopian anime </span><i><span>Akaduma Drive </span></i><span>couldn’t prepare me for what I’d find on the other side of </span><i><span>The Hundred Line</span></i><span>’s tactical battles.</span></p>

 <p><span>As the “Last Defense Squad” grows in combatants over the course of 100 days, each member takes on different, highly specialized roles in combat. All of their big personalities manifest in different fighting styles and weapons only they can use, all spawning from a force called hemoanima within them. This is why these particular kids are fighting on behalf of humanity; they’re the only ones who can.</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000651797" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000651797"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000651797">© Too Kyo Games / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p><span>That specialization is why </span><i><span>Hundred Line</span></i><span>’s combat</span> <span>doesn’t quite match the strategic play of something like </span><i><span>Baldur’s Gate 3</span></i><span>, as it makes each battle feel like a puzzle to solve. Most characters have only one or two attack patterns; Kako, for instance, a meek younger sister in the group, uses a sniper rifle to avoid the scrap, and thus excels at long range. Then there are bolder heroes like the main protagonist, Takumi, who wields a sword that puts him on the front lines as he seeks to lead the group.</span></p>

 <p><span>Some might find these rigid roles limiting. </span><i><span>Hundred Line</span></i><span>’s battles don’t feel like free-for-all scenarios in which you’re meant to move pieces around a board to your whim. Battles often spawn your heroes on different sides of the school, and those characters might not have great synergies with each other, so it’s up to you to figure out how best to defend the Last Defense Academy from incoming alien forces with the mini team comps you’re given on each side. The greatest strategy in </span><i><span>Hundred Line </span></i><span>is improvising, and sometimes that means making a big play that will take some of your own team members off the board in favor of giving the survivors an opening.</span></p> <p><span>Each battle is divided into waves, and your characters are all revived at the beginning of a round, so it’s perfectly viable to sacrifice a character knowing they will come back shortly. Some of my favorite plays involved using a character’s ultimate ability, a high-impact attack your unit can perform when low on health in exchange for their life. Killing certain enemies grants your team more actions before the opposition’s turn, so using a self-sacrificing ultimate to take out some of my foes and let one of my other combatants whale on a boss a few more times is a sacrifice I’m willing to make. Those decisions aren’t something you typically strategize around; they’re just making the most of what you have in the moment.</span></p> <p><span>After all, those spur-of-the-moment plays and intricate synergies are in service of taking down a mindless horde of aliens that mean to harm humanity, right? We should feel nothing tearing through them to save all our friends and family waiting to return to Earth after they’ve been given the all clear…right?</span></p>

  <p><i><span>The Hundred Line</span></i><span>’s 100 days come to a close pretty quickly, all things considered. The average player will hit that deadline in about 30 hours. But there’s a reason, even after having seen the end of those 100 days, that I never reviewed </span><i><span>The Hundred Line </span></i><a href="https://kotaku.com/hundred-line-last-defense-academy-review-danganronpa-1851777031"><span>when it launched in April</span></a><span>, and still wasn’t ready to when I </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/hundred-line-last-defense-academy-review-danganronpa-1851777031"><span>declared it an easy contender for 2025’s Game of the Year</span></a><span> the following month. It’s what happens after you reach that final day that makes it one of the most ambitious and important games of the year.</span></p> <p><span>By the time Takumi and the rest of the Last Defense Squad reach the 100th day, pretty much everything has gone wrong. You’ve lost members of your team in the war, one of your own has betrayed the mission, and the thing you sought to protect has been destroyed, but what you’ve lost may be your only hope to make things right.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>Deep in the depths of the Last Defense Academy, the team has found what they were recruited to protect: a baby swaddled in flame who has spent these three months gathering power to cover the planet in undying fire, killing the rest of the invaders and allowing humanity to finally return and rebuild. This baby, like the rest of the crew, is able to use hemoanima, and since he’s been storing up his power for all this time, he is far more powerful than any of the others who are capable of using it.</span></p> <p><span>However, when one of your crew betrays the mission and kills this fire-covered baby, they’re able to absorb his charged-up power and wield it in what seems like a final boss fight. In this fight, the ex-party member’s “Specialist Skill,” or an ability that only they have, is upgraded. When Takumi defeats them, he absorbs all this energy. Typically, his power is to rewind turns in battle, but now that gift is more far-reaching than it has been in the last 100 days. Now, Takumi can rewind much farther. In fact, he’s now able to go back all 100 days, and that’s what he does, hoping that maybe this time, he’ll be able to save humanity.</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000002145" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000002145"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000002145">© Too Kyo Games / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p><span>At this point, </span><i><span>The Hundred Line </span></i><span>puts a </span><i><span>2 </span></i><span>on its title screen, and Takumi must relive the 100 days and try to salvage the mission. Using the knowledge you have from the first time you saw this whole thing go south, you can get it right this time…maybe. This is where Kotaro Uchikoshi, </span><i><span>Hundred Line</span></i><span>’s co-director, known for his work on the </span><i><span>Zero Escape </span></i><span>series, grabs the wheel. You don’t just watch the 100 days play out again as Takumi makes all the right decisions this time; you have to make calls that will drastically change the course of events. </span><i><span>The Hundred Line </span></i><span>has over 20 routes, with each branching into one of several endings, all culminating in 100 possible conclusions. You can jump around the timeline as many times as you need to until you’ve either seen them all or you’re satisfied with the conclusion you received, but it’s up to you to use all you learned from the first route to try and find a better conclusion than the dire one you found the first time.</span></p>

 <p><i><span>The Hundred Line</span></i><span>’s many routes range in quality. Some of them are gags, like one that abandons all the stakes to make the story a slice-of-life comedy or a harem anime arc; others are genuine tactical challenges, like one that requires you to engage in long battles almost every other day in the three-month run. Broadly, </span><i><span>The Hundred Line</span></i><span>’s many routes are chances for its writing team to morph and mold its core premise into different genre stories. There’s a route that turns into a slasher story, another that riffs on zombie fiction, and there’s even one that turns into a </span><i><span>Danganronpa</span></i><span>-like killing game.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Yes, there is arguably a “true” route that solves the broader mysteries, but the degree to which </span><i><span>Hundred Line </span></i><span>is willing to remix everything you think you know about this story to deliver something entirely unrecognizable is such an incredible swing that I can’t believe Too Kyo Games pulled it off. Giving you the reins to steer the story in one of its many directions is a bold move that can easily lead to moments of incredible discovery but also to frustration as you reach what feel like dead ends or time-wasting conclusions.&nbsp;</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000651798" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000651798"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000651798">© Too Kyo Games / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p><span>Some of these storylines will tell you things you won’t find out elsewhere, and so playing through all 100 routes isn’t just something for the sickest of completionists; it does genuinely help fill out everything you do and don’t understand about the world you spent 100 days defending with blinders on. All 22 routes and 100 endings are equal parts supplementary reading and fully curricular. The real choice to make, then, is how long you want to spend with your hand on a wall, walking down the dark hallways of the Last Defense Academy to see every corner.</span></p> <p><span>I have only seen a handful of endings myself, and I told myself I’d go back to see more of them as the year went on, but I didn’t get around to as many as I wanted.

But</span><i><span> The Hundred Line</span></i><span> is still an achievement that most developers wouldn’t even entertain in a pitch, and Too Kyo Games made it when the studio had everything to lose.&nbsp;</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000651799" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000651799"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000651799">© Too Kyo Games / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p><span>Too Kyo Games easily could have set its niche obsessions of killing games, branching narratives, and mind-bending twists aside and created something that aimed for the widest personal audience in hopes that it would save the studio. Instead, it committed to what it knows, leaning into what has always made its leads’ work so memorable. Where others might have pumped the brakes on their ambitions, Too Kyo slammed its foot on the gas and hoped there would still be another route to follow when it reached the end. </span><i><span>The Hundred Line: Last Defense Academy </span></i><span>may not be for everyone, but anyone can see what it’s done and know that it’s earned their respect.</span></p>      </div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/the-hundred-line-last-defense-academy-the-kotaku-review-2000651792]]></content:encoded>

<p>Use these Geometry Dash monthly redeem codes for December 2025 to get your hands on plenty of free rewards, including Diamonds, Mana Orbs and other cosmetics.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Does a combination of the PC classic, Dave and Guitar Hero sound like a fun experience to you? If so, you need to check out the exhilarating experience that is Geometry Dash immediately. Geometry Dash is a popular platformer where syncing your movements to the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/roblox-music-codes-best-song-ids/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">music</a> is of utmost importance. Players are required to guide an icon from one end of the map to the other, all while maintaining the rhythm and avoiding obstacles and other distractions. The game auto-scrolls to the side, meaning that the amount of time players have to make decisions is also quite limited.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There are 26 distinct levels that come standard in Geometry Dash, with each level having its own unique soundtrack. Another feature that makes Geometry Dash so popular among its players is the level editor. This allows users to create their own custom maps for the game, with the added bonus of being able to select the soundtrack for each level. For players looking to customise their gameplay experience by changing the player icon, there are vaults where this can be done – The Vault, The Wraith Vault, The Vault Of Secrets and The Chamber Of Time. This article provides players with all of the active Geometry Dash codes for each of these vaults.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>It looks like those on PlayStation Plus' Extra and Premium tiers can expect two more blockbuster games to join the service next week.</p>

<p>We were quite taken with Assassin's Creed Mirage on its release in 2023, calling it a "rich and characterful adventure".</p>
<p>"I have frequently looked at Assassin's games as historical adventures with a bit of wonky sci-fi glamour, and Mirage's late-game certainly conforms to the formula in this regard. But what Mirage, and Mirage's Baghdad in particular, have reminded me is that the historical stuff is where the real care is found," reads <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-mirage-review">Eurogamer's four star Assassin's Creed Mirage review</a>.</p><p>Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty also came out in 2023, and again we quite liked it. "Team Ninja evolves Nioh's formula in a Three Kingdoms-era action RPG where allies, flags, and stealth make its brutal challenges more manageable than ever," reads <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/wo-long-fallen-dynasty-review-masocore-action-with-an-approachable-twist">Eurogamer's Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty review</a>.</p>
<p>Sony is expected to announce its PS Plus December line up soon, so stay tuned for the official announcement.</p>

<p>Elsewhere in Assassin's Creed news, a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-black-flag-remake-spotted-again-ahead-of-the-game-awards">PEGI rating for Black Flag Resynced was recently spotted</a>, further cementing that those remake rumours are indeed true. Perhaps we will officially hear more on Black Flag's remake at <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-black-flag-remake-spotted-again-ahead-of-the-game-awards">The Game Awards later this week</a>?</p>

<figure data-uuid="7fc8ef16a4588"><a title="Nintendo Switch 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/7fc8ef16a4588/nintendo-switch-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Damien McFerran / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Despite the massive Switch 2 sales out of the gate, Nintendo's shares have been slipping throughout December, dropping as much as 4.7% yesterday. Why? It seems fears surrounding chip shortages may be to blame.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-12-10/nintendo-sheds-14-billion-value-after-chip-squeeze-fears-grow">Bloomberg</a> (paywall) estimates that Nintendo's market value may have already decreased by as much as $14 billion this month, as Switch 2 RAM module costs have leapt up 41% in the quarter.</p>
<p>It's not just RAM either. The console's NAND storage has also seen an estimated 8% price rise, as both SanDisk and Samsung have delayed shipments of flash chips due to "increased demand from large data centres and hyperscalers", according to a <a href="https://x.com/jukan05/status/1996105253545279875">recent statement</a> from SSD manufacturer Transcend.</p>
<p>This shortage explains the pricy state of microSD Express cards — the <em>only</em> expandable storage method for Switch 2 — which regularly sit at the best part of $200 for the beefy 1TB option and around $60-$80 for the smaller 256GB. "This is effectively a cost that Nintendo has passed onto the gamer," Pelham Smithers of Pelham Smithers Associates told Bloomberg.</p>
<p>Of course, the holiday season is near-enough guaranteed to be a big one for Nintendo and the Switch 2. Last month, the company <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/switch-2-sells-over-10-million-units-nintendo-increases-forecast-even-further">upped its sales forecast</a> from 15 million to 19 million Switch 2 sales by the end of the financial year, and its impressive start is nothing to be scoffed at.</p>
<p>But consoles cost money to make, and if memory costs stay on the up-and-up, who knows what the company will need to do to keep its profits moving in the right direction.</p>

<p data-start="0" data-end="503">If you’re a runner or really anyone who’s serious about fitness, a reliable watch is a must. The best way to improve yourself at any activity is by setting incremental goals, and you can’t effectively track your progress without the right tools. The Apple Watch Ultra 2 is a tough, durable smartwatch that’s designed to be your perfect partner, whether you’re in the gym or building your cardio the great outdoors. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6318/">Right now, you can grab it at Amazon for $250 off, bringing the price down to $549 from its regular price of $799.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6318/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/i-have-never-played-a-game-like-this-before-doom-creator-john-romero-compares-next-game-to-elden-ring/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Earlier this year, a massive wave of layoffs at Xbox affected several gaming projects, including announced titles like <a href="https://wccftech.com/perfect-dark-cancelled-the-initiative-shut-down-microsoft-layoffs/"><strong>Perfect Dark</strong></a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/zenimax-online-new-mmorpg-canceled/"><strong>a new MMORPG by ZeniMax Online</strong></a>, and many others. <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/doom-creators-romero-games-next-unannounced-project-has-been-cancelled/">The next unannounced project by Romero Games</a></strong>, the studio created by DOOM series creator John Romero, was also cancelled, but today, it has been confirmed that it has been saved, and though its scope has been changed, it will be an innovative experience in the vein of FromSoftware's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/elden-ring-make-way-for-the-elden-lord/"><strong>Elden Ring</strong></a>.</p>



<p>As shown in the video by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@htdreams"><strong>Andrés De Pedro Álvarez</strong></a>, speaking at the Salón del Videojuego de Madrid 2025 last week, the creator of the DOOM series confirmed that the unannounced project has been saved. However, the game has been redesigned and has become something different despite incorporating many elements from the title canceled earlier this year.</p>



<p>Though the DOOM series creator couldn't get into specifics other than the fact that the game is much smaller than before, he did say that he has never played a game like this shooter before. <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">"But, the things that you do in it, will be new to people, the way that going through Elden Ring was a really new experience,"</em> Romero said. </p>



<p>Comparing the game to a masterpiece like FromSoftware's is definitely bold, but also very exciting, especially coming from the developer that contributed to the creation of the genre with Wolfenstein 3D and its establishment with the DOOM and Quake series.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>The confirmation that the next project from Romero Games has been saved is rather welcome, but not entirely surprising. Following the cancellation of the game that Xbox would have published, it was revealed that <a href="https://wccftech.com/romero-games-is-not-closed-studio-clarifies/"><strong>the studio had not closed and was evaluating opportunities from other publishers</strong></a>. Hopefully, it won't take much longer to see the first glimpses of a game that already sounds very interesting.</p>

            <p>Well, there you go. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/arc-raiders">Arc Raiders</a>' winter update's now got got a proper release date. Snow will be coming to the shooter on December 16th, and judging by the way Embark have revealed that, it looks like there could be a temperature-based twist coming to the usual murder-deathing and trying to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/arc-raiders-update-140-takes-aim-at-locked-room-exploits-and-item-swap-induced-rapid-fire">sneak into places you shouldn't</a>.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/arc-raiders-first-roadmap-promises-lots-of-goodies-like-a-new-map-quests-and-more-before-the-end-of-the-year">roadmap</a> Embark put out last month offers a good glimpse into what'll be coming with this update, dubbed Cold Snap. The snowfall map condition, which does what it says on the tin, will bring with it a "Flickering Flames" event, a new raider deck, and new quests.</p>
<p>Plus, a day after Cold Snap drops, the chance to reset your character via a prestige-esque extraction project will <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/embark-dishes-on-all-the-goodies-youll-get-in-arc-raiders-if-you-choose-to-prestige-later-this-month">start being offered</a>.</p> <div>

<p>Cool. While the addition of snow alone's not much to write home about, the fact Embark have revealed Cold Snap's arrival date via a shot of a dead bloke lying in the now does seem like it might suggest some survival-style temperature mechanics you'll have to stay on the right side of in order not to catch your death. Maybe flickering flames is all about chucking yourself into a fire before your fingers and toes start to freeze up and fall off.</p><p>Cold Snap marks the end of the additions Embark have pulled back the curtain on thus far, with a fresh roadmap for 2026 likely to arrive not long after the calendar flips over, if not before then.

              <p>The shock of&nbsp;<a href="https://kotaku.com/black-ops-7-helldivers-2-lava-skyblivion-delay-2000650525"><em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</em> having stumbled out of the gate</a> has clearly hit publisher Activision hard. Reports that the latest entry in the annual franchise has seen a slump in player numbers are seemingly <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2025/12/call-of-duty-message-from-the-team">confirmed by a statement</a> the publisher put out late last night, in which it was stated that “the Franchise has not met your expectations fully,” and that as a result there will no longer be “back-to-back releases of <em>Modern Warfare</em> or&nbsp;<em>Black Ops&nbsp;</em>games.”</p> <p>For over 20 years, the&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty</em> franchise has been the backbone of Microsoft-owned Activision’s sales, more often than not the best-selling game of a given year, and routinely bringing in in excess of $2 billion. But in 2025, that run seems to have once more faltered. Observable player numbers are way down, user reviews are extremely bad, and old rivals like <em>Battlefield</em> have reappeared and eaten its lunch.</p>

 <p>To be completely clear, <em>Black Ops 7</em> isn’t a disaster! It will likely make a solid profit, perhaps be one of the best-selling games of 2025, but the issue likes in Activision’s colossal expectations for the series. Anything short of record-breaking popularity is perceived as failure, given how much of the company’s financial claims will have been predicated on such success. This has clearly spooked the now Microsoft-owned Activision Blizzard so much that it’s made a public statement, ostensibly directed to players but clearly aimed at shareholders, to <em>mea culpa</em> and promise to do better next year.</p>

 <p>The whole statement is a masterclass in euphemism, each negative phrased as a positive, its opening paragraph thanking us for “the feedback” from a “passionate community” (“please stop yelling!”) and stating “we know what you expect and rest assured we will deliver,” (“we fucked up, we know we fucked up!”).</p>

 <p>After announcing a free week next week for multiplayer and Zombies, and explaining how impossibly brilliant the seasonal updates are going to be, the statement eventually states that “our strategy going forward is changing.”</p> <ul> <li> <blockquote><p>We will no longer do back-to-back releases of Modern Warfare or Black Ops games. The reasons are many, but the main one is to ensure we provide an absolutely unique experience each and every year.</p></blockquote> </li> <li> <blockquote><p>We will drive innovation that is meaningful, not incremental. While we aren’t sharing those plans today, we look forward to doing so when the time is right.</p></blockquote> </li> </ul> <p>This seems very much designed to respond to widespread complaints that this year’s outing feels too familiar with a terrible always-online campaign, thus losing the public’s wider interests when there’s a big, bold and fresh-feeling <em>Battlefield 6</em> to be playing instead.</p>

 <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-sales-expert-opinion">A&nbsp;<em>Eurogamer</em> interview</a> with&nbsp;<em>The Game Business</em>‘s Chris Dring last week reported that not only had&nbsp;<em>Black Ops 7</em> not performed well since its November 14 release, but that&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty</em> has a whole has seen far lower numbers of players throughout 2025. While no official sales or player numbers have been reported by Activision, and things are futher obfuscated by the game being released on Game Pass, public facing stats like <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1938090/charts/">those of&nbsp;<em>SteamDB</em></a> show just how few people are playing&nbsp;<em>CoD</em> on Steam compared to both previous years&nbsp;<em>and</em> this years strong competition in the form of <em>Battlefield 6</em>,&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2</em> and free-to-play&nbsp;<em>Delta Force</em>.</p>

 <h2>Innovation vs. escalation</h2> <p>Of course, what this statement is&nbsp;<em>not</em> saying is that there won’t be a new&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty</em> in 2026, but rather that it won’t be&nbsp;<em>Modern Warfare&nbsp;</em>or&nbsp;<em>Black Ops</em>. The last time the franchise featured any other branch was 2021’s <em>Call of Duty:</em> <em>Vanguard</em>, and before that, 2017’s <em>Call of Duty: WWII.</em> Both were the best-selling games in the U.S. in their years, but it’s noteworthy that Activision was still disappointed by&nbsp;<em>Vanguard</em>‘s sales, <a href="https://kotaku.com/activision-call-duty-vanguard-modern-warfare-2-release-1848873636">blaming this on the World War II setting and a lack of “innovation.”</a></p>

 <p>It seems we’re back there once again, although this time the franchise is in a tougher spot. <em>Vanguard</em>‘s perceived failures were cited as being because of what it <em>wasn’t</em>, and the company was able to declare that no one need worry (it was in the midst of the <a href="https://kotaku.com/everything-that-has-happened-since-the-activision-blizz-1847401161">sexual abuse scandals</a>, some <a href="https://kotaku.com/report-activisions-bobby-kotick-didnt-just-know-he-al-1848066600">specific to&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty</em></a><a href="https://kotaku.com/report-activisions-bobby-kotick-didnt-just-know-he-al-1848066600"> management</a>, as well as trying to ensure its $69 billion sale to Microsoft), and that next year there would instead be a game-changing new entry in the&nbsp;<em>Modern Warfare</em> series. But this time, the statement promises nothing at all beyond hopes and dreams, given falling back on what’s worked before clearly isn’t the answer.</p> <p>It remains to be seen if there even is an answer. 22 years of annual releases (plus spin-offs) is enough to exhaust even the most ardent, die-hard fan, and after a while just the words “<em>Call of Duty</em>” can feel leaden, even outdated. It would be more sensible for Activision and Microsoft to pull back on expectations, perhaps spend less on a game that innovates rather than escalates, fascinating a gaming audience into not wanting to be left out. But given the need to appease shareholders, the forced move is always to go bigger, spend more, risk more, and make more. If the issue really is general fatigue among players, that could be a hefty disaster.</p> <p>“To be clear,” ends the “Call of Duty team’s” statement, “the future of <em>Call of Duty</em> is very strong and we believe our best days are ahead of us given the depth and talent of our development teams.” It continues,</p> <blockquote><p>“We have been building the next era of <em>Call of Duty</em>, and it will deliver precisely on what you want along with some surprises that push the Franchise and the genre forward. We look forward to welcoming you in, listening to you, and moving forward together.”</p></blockquote> <p>It’s going to be an interesting year.</p>

            <p>Netflix considers Warner Bros.' game studios to be "relatively minor", as it admits they didn't factor into its $82.7bn acquisition deal.</p>
<p>Last week, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/netflix-acquires-warner-bros-in-827bn-deal-including-studios-behind-mortal-kombat-and-hogwarts-legacy">Netflix announced its intention to acquire Warner Bros.</a>, which would include its game studios as part of the bid. That said, gaming was not mentioned in the press release for the news, while a webcast for the news only included gaming in passing.</p>
<p>Now, in the company's <a href="https://seekingalpha.com/article/4851311-netflix-inc-nflx-presents-at-ubs-global-media-and-communications-conference-2025-transcript">latest earnings call</a>, Netflix co-CEO Gregory Peters made it clear gaming was not a major consideration as part of its bid. "While they definitely have been doing some great work in the game space, we actually didn't attribute any value to that from the get-go because they're relatively minor compared to the grand scheme of things," he said.</p>
<p>It's fair to say Warner Bros. has been struggling in the games industry as of late. In its 2025 Q1 earnings report, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/warner-bros-failed-to-launch-a-game-last-quarter-resulting-in-48-drop-in-gaming-revenue">company reported a 48 percent decrease in games revenue due to no new releases</a>. Its most recent earnings report from November reports a 23 percent decrease, again due to no new releases.</p>
<p>This follows the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/warner-bros-games-cancels-major-game-expansion-as-financial-woes-continue">cancellation of a planned expansion to Hogwarts Legacy</a>; layoffs at Rocksteady after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/suicide-squad-flopped-due-to-perfectionism-and-ill-suited-genre-pivot-report">Suicide Squad flopped</a>; the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/warner-bros-reportedly-cancels-wonder-woman-closes-monolith-and-other-studios">cancellation of Monolith Productions' Wonder Woman game</a>; and the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/multiversus-director-in-deep-mourning-following-last-weeks-shutdown-news">shutdown of brawler Multiversus</a>.</p>
<p>Still, it's not as if Warner Bros. isn't capable of success. A report from <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-27/warner-bros-cancels-planned-hogwarts-legacy-game-expansion?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc0MzEwMzc5MiwiZXhwIjoxNzQzNzA4NTkyLCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJTVFNSRDZUMEFGQjQwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.dGBdhB7lWw3cxZNYXHsmp5Xz3rOJ-TM3ph6fDrDzGpg&amp;leadSource=uverify%20wall&amp;embedded-checkout=true">Bloomberg</a> earlier this year stated <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hogwarts-legacy">Hogwarts Legacy</a> had sold over 34m copies, making it one of the best-selling games ever. A sequel is reportedly in the works.</p><p>"Now we're super excited because some of those properties that they've built, Hogwarts is a great example of that, have done quite well, and we think that we can incorporate that into what we're offering," said Peters in the Netflix earnings call. "Quite well" is a bit of an understatement.</p>
<p>He continued: "They've got great studios and great folks working there. So we think that there's definitely an opportunity there. But just to be clear, we haven't built that into our deal model."</p>
<p>Though harsh, there's certainly some truth in Peters' comments. Hogwarts Legacy's success alone isn't enough to keep Warner Bros.' gaming studios afloat. And while a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/warner-bros-games-restructures-leadership-team-following-new-focus-on-game-of-thrones-dc-harry-potter-and-mortal-kombat">change in leadership came in June as the company doubled down on its biggest franchises</a> (Mortal Kombat, Harry Potter, DC, Game of Thrones), nothing has been seen yet.</p>
<p>Still, it appears gaming is not a priority for Netflix, which doesn't bode well for the future of these studios. So while <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rocksteady-has-a-new-single-player-batman-game-in-development-teases-new-report">Rocksteady is reportedly working on a new Batman game</a> to follow its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/batman-arkham-games-order">Arkham series</a>, it's unclear how this may be impacted by the acquisition.</p>
<p>And it's not quite over yet - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/paramount-to-ruin-the-netflix-party-hollywood-studio-announces-clearly-superior-warner-bros-offer-of-its-own">Paramount has also made a public offer for Warner Bros.</a>, in a bid to outdo Netflix's "inferior" proposal.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>With <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/11/15/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-3-2023-review/">Modern Warfare 3 (2023)</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/black-ops-7">Black Ops 7</a> being two of the worst received <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/call-of-duty">Call of Duty</a> games, Activision has stated that they will not to do back-to-back games in their Call of Duty sub-franchises going forward.</p>
<p>In a blog post addressing the future of the franchise, the Call of Duty team start by saying “thank you for all for the feedback we have received over the last few months,” which is a nice way of putting it. “Call of Duty has enjoyed long-standing success because of all of you, a passionate community that demands excellence and deserves nothing less. We also know that for some of you, the Franchise has not met your expectations fully. To be very clear, we know what you expect and rest assured we will deliver, and overdeliver, on those expectations as we move forward.”</p>


<p>Of course, for the next year, that means giving Black Ops 7 as much support as needed to tide them over to 2026’s COD. So next week they will be hosting a free trial for Black Ops 7 multiplayer and Zombies, hand-in-hand with a Double XP weekend.</p>
<p>“We would like you to experience the game firsthand and decide for yourselves,” they say, and so they’re putting the two stronger sides of the game forward for consideration. It has been the story campaign that has come in for the strongest criticism, while multiplayer is a continuation of Black Ops 6, and remains the beating heart of this franchise.</p>
<p>Further to this, they promise “unprecedented” support through seasonal content: “Season 01 is the largest live season ever and we’re just getting started.&nbsp; We won’t rest until Black Ops 7 earns its place as one of the best Black Ops games we’ve ever made.”</p>

<p>But the most important point is that they will no longer do back-to-back releases of Modern Warfare or Black Ops games, which has led to dismal reviews and a wave of negativity for the franchise. The team promise:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>We will no longer do back-to-back releases of Modern Warfare or Black Ops games. The reasons are many, but the main one is to ensure we provide an absolutely unique experience each and every year.</em></li>
<li><em>We will drive innovation that is meaningful, not incremental. While we aren’t sharing those plans today, we look forward to doing so when the time is right.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Black Ops 7 was another disappointment after the highs of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/31/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-review/">Black Ops 6</a> last year. While Activision’s teams talked about how the two games were conceived around the same time, the campaign was a major disappointment, focussing entirely on co-op, replaying hits from Black Ops 2 in an unsatisfying way, and casting a pallor over the series just as shooter rivals like <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/10/09/battlefield-6-review/">Battlefield 6</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/11/26/arc-raiders-review/">ARC Raiders</a> arrived.</p>
<p>In our review, I said, “Black Ops 7 really demonstrates the difficulties of Call of Duty’s yearly release schedule and going back-to-back with its sub-series. It’s not as rushed-feeling as Modern Warfare III was, that’s for sure, but it’s also not a consistent experience. The multiplayer and Zombies are solid continuations from last year, but there’s not too much excitement in that, especially after the energy-sapping co-op campaign and Endgame.”</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>In a week, the second season of the Fallout show <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-season-2-lands-december-17-prime-video/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">will air on Amazon Prime Video</a>, and the main cast is currently busy with a series of interviews. Walton Goggins, the renowned actor behind what's arguably the most iconic character in the TV series, The Ghoul (which was <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-76-burning-springs-update-now-live-adding-the-ghoul-from-the-show/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">just added to Fallout 76 as a quest-giving NPC</a>, voiced by Goggins), recently appeared <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TgVH3ASR4cw" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in an interview with Virgin Radio UK's 'Chris Evans Breakfast Show'</a> to reveal that creator Jonathan Nolan, the producers, the cast and the whole staff 'went for broke' instead of playing it safe with this second season.</p>



<p><em>I've been in this situation a few times where, if over the course of the first chapter of a show, if you will, if you're able to build a critical mass, what you have an opportunity to do in season two or chapter 2, is play it safe or go for broke and put everything in there. And that's what we did. We, meaning like, us in front of the camera, but really everybody behind the camera. There are 700 people employed by the Fallout show. It is a world.</em></p>



<p>Later in the interview, the actor showered Jonathan Nolan with praise for the scene in the first season's pilot when the bombs start dropping and his character, Cooper Howard, runs with his daughter for their lives.</p>



<p><em>It's based on one of the biggest video games in the world, right? Fallout. This game has been played for 20-some years by players all over the world, and there's a very unique attachment to this experience. When we set out to do this, Jonathan Nolan in cahoots with Todd Howard and Bethesda Games, the idea was to tell an original story within the canon of Fallout. So yeah, it picks up in the very first episode with the ending of the world really seen through my perspective. I didn't understand what a unique opportunity that was for me until I saw it on film. Even though I experienced it, you know, on the day, but seeing it, I didn't realize that it was going to affect me viscerally the way that it did. [...] The way that John Nolan architected those shots and the way that he chose to tell that story was terrifying.</em></p>



<p>The second season of the Fallout show will run for eight episodes, just like the first one. A new episode will be released each week, with the second one scheduled for Christmas Eve, the third for New Year's Eve, and the final one for February 4, 2026. The story picks up immediately in the aftermath of the previous season's finale, taking viewers on a journey through the Mojave wasteland to the post-apocalyptic city of New Vegas (<a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-tv-show-is-100-canon-and-doesnt-retcon-new-vegas-says-bethesda-deathclaws-are-coming-next-season/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">without retconning the events seen in the game Fallout: New Vegas</a>). Deathclaws have been confirmed to appear this season, too.</p>



<p>New additions to the cast of the Fallout show include Macaulay Culkin, who plays a mysterious "crazy genius" character; Justin Theroux, who portrays Robert House, the ruler of New Vegas; Kumail Nanjiani, who stars as a high-ranking officer of the Brotherhood of Steel; and Amy Acker, who will play Cooper Howard's assistant during the flashbacks. The show <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-tv-series-renewed-for-third-season-second-season-gets-december-release-window-and-first-teaser/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">is already confirmed for a third season, too</a>.</p>

			<p>Among the technical solutions Sony implemented in its PlayStation 5 to enable the system to reach maximum performance without issue is a liquid metal cooling solution, which helps keep temperatures down when the system is pushed to its limits.</p>



<p>This cooling solution, however, led to significant issues, as <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed"><a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-design-flaw-might-kill-the-console-by-using-it-vertically/">the liquid metal can leak and leave dry spots on critical components, resulting in various malfunctions.</a></strong> Although Sony made some changes for the PlayStation 5 Pro and some of the latest base console models, liquid metal cooling issues can still affect systems, potentially even all of them, according to a technician.</p>



<p>Over on X,<a href="https://x.com/Modyfikator89"><strong> modder and service technician modyfikatorcasper</strong></a> shared a new report on a PlayStation 5 Slim (CFI-2016) system with less than one and a half years of life, which has been impacted by liquid metal issues. In this case, however, the liquid metal leak wasn't caused by the system's position, but by application quality and degradation over time and temperature. As such, the service technician believes all PS5 systems will eventually require maintenance, regardless of the model and its position.</p>



<figure><div>

</div></figure>



<p>While the claim that all PlayStation 5 models will eventually require maintenance is bold, it is undeniable that the liquid metal issues have affected a lot of systems. Earlier this year, Alderon Games founder Matthew Cassels highlighted how <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-liquid-metal-issues-consoles-dying/">these issues are becoming more widespread</a></strong>, with an increasing number of users reporting various malfunctions over the past few months.</p>



<p><span>As most <span>current reports of PlayStation 5 units malfunctioning due to liquid metal issues involve older systems, it will take some time to determine if the&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/sony-ps5-consoles-improved-liquid-metal-application-similar-to-ps5-pro-prevent-leak-better-cooling/" target="_blank"><strong>new liquid metal TIM layout</strong></a>&nbsp;of the newly released&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/new-playstation-5-cfi-2100-model-addresses-critial-liquid-metal-issue/" target="_blank"><strong>CFI-2100 model</strong></a>&nbsp;has been accompanied by improved</span> application to prevent degradation over time, as it should with leaking issues.</span></p>

            <p>With <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-7">Call of Duty Black Ops 7</a> now out in the wild and having earned a largely mixed reception, Activision have said right, that's it, time to do a thing. Said thing is committing to no longer releasing entries in the same sub-series, be that Modern Warfare or Black Ops, in back-to-back years going forwards.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>This change was relayed via a the latest <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2025/12/call-of-duty-message-from-the-team">CoD blog post</a>, the first paragraph of which acts as a mea culpa of sorts for Blops 7 not hitting the heights previous entries have in terms of keeping shooty folks happy. Or, as Activision put it: "We also know that for some of you, the Franchise has not met your expectations fully." Ah yes, the capital F franchise, good job of not sounding like a robot there.</p>
<p>"To be very clear, we know what you expect and rest assured we will deliver, and overdeliver, on those expectations as we move forward," the publishers added, in a line that sounds slightly more human.</p>
<p>So, no more releasing Black Ops 7s right after Black Ops 6es, or Modern Warfare 3 reboots right after Modern Warfare 2 reboots, in the name of providing "an absolutely unique experience each and every year". "We will drive innovation that is meaningful, not incremental," Activision added. "While we aren’t sharing those plans today, we look forward to doing so when the time is right."</p><p>For now, the publishers reaffirmed their commitment to keep on adding new seasonal stuff to Black Ops 7 and working to turn around opinion on the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">shooter</a>, declaring: "We won’t rest until Black Ops 7 earns its place as one of the best Black Ops games we’ve ever made." They're also keeping their chins up about the series' future, asserting that they "believe our best days are ahead of us given the depth and talent of our development teams.</p>
<p>If you've yet to see how Blops 7 stacks up in the great pantheon of games about military people crouch walking and using sniper rifles to kill enemies at point blank range, Rick Lane kindly reviewed both its "<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-campaign-review">hideous mess of a campaign</a>" and its slightly better, but also "overshadowed by the spectre of generative AI" <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-multiplayer-review">multiplayer</a> for us.</p>

The finished spreadsheet arranges the characters in order from most to least speaking time, which reveals just how much our vampire friend Astarion loves to talk.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> The Baldur's Gate 3 Cast Answers Our Burning Questions</p>
      </div>
<p>It's unsurprising that Amelia Tyler's Narrator, whose voice is ever-present through Baldur's Gate 3 as the game's pseudo-DM, has the most lines of dialogue, clocking in at a total of 14 hours and 43 minutes of speaking time. What is surprising is how (relatively) close behind her Astarion sits, with a whopping 13 hours and 6 minutes of dialogue for the Neil Newbon-voiced vampire companion.</p><p>Despite her memory issues, Shadowheart is the next-chattiest companion, while returning favorite Minsc has the least dialogue of all the companions. The full <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1830hh3fNYewVBdqTFRfjL6wvRfGp6DEIZFY_6BbLsOk/edit?gid=1474580599#gid=1474580599" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">spreadsheet</a> has some other interesting surprises, such as the entry for "Rat" having almost three hours of unique dialogue and ranking above major characters like The Emperor and Raphael--a solid reminder that we should definitely cast Speak With Animals more often.</p><p>The total tally of spoken dialogue comes to 236 hours, 55 minutes, and 45 seconds--almost 10 days worth of voice lines spread across 2068 characters.</p><p>If tallying the length of all the files wasn't enough work, Everwhite-moonlight also created a seperate <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1AdseRVefYowbQfc5xE9VHvMsLbk6pU6F/view" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">document</a> that transcribes each individual voice line in the game, cross-referencing them with their cue ID for anyone who wants to find a specific line in the game files.</p><p>Despite its age, Baldur's Gate 3 has <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-studio-reacts-to-the-game-awards-nomination-what-the-fk/1100-6536343/" data-ref-id="1100-6536343">been nominated for The Game Awards 2025</a>, picking up a nod for Best Community Support. Developer Larian Studios appears to be gearing up to announce something new at The Game Awards this year, with clues pointing to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-mystery-of-the-game-awards-monolith-appears-to-have-been-spoiled-by-a-trademark-filing/1100-6536822/" data-ref-id="1100-6536822">a new Divinity game</a>.</p>

            <p>Doom creator John Romero's cancelled game is back, with the developer stating the untitled project has "survived".</p>
<p>Following mass layoffs at Microsoft this summer, Romero Games - the studio set up by the Doom creator and his wife Brenda - announced <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/doom-creator-john-romeros-next-shooter-project-loses-funding-following-microsoft-cuts">its publisher had pulled funding for its game along with "other unannounced projects at other studios"</a>. While Microsoft was not mentioned as being involved, this much was inferred.</p>
<p>Soon after this, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/doom-creator-john-romeros-studio-not-closed-as-publishers-express-interest-in-saving-cancelled-game">Romero Games assured fans the studio had not been closed</a>, and the team was now on the hunt for a new publisher to handle its cancelled game. And, it seems a new publisher or some kind of deal was indeed found, with Romero recently stating the game had "survived cancellation".</p>

<p>Romero discussed the topic of his studio's cancelled game at Salón del Videojuego de Madrid (see video below). Confirming it had been saved, Romero was met with waves of applause from the audience, before he shared a few more details about what we can all expect on its release.</p><p>"There's a really good 110 people working on the game," Romero said, adding it has "been basically completely redesigned". The studio's upcoming game has "nothing" to do with the previous game, he furthered, but "incorporates a lot of the elements" from it.</p>
<p>"We're not starting at ground zero," the developer said. "We can take pieces out of and put into a brand new indie game. We have a lot of stuff we can put in the game. The design is completely different, but the team is very excited about the new design."</p>
<p>He added it is now a "much smaller game" than before, but it is "more fun" for the team as "the people working on it are all directors from different departments, and they didn't actually get to the code or design or whatever to do it themselves, but now we get to actually do that". Said Romero: "[We get to] do the thing we are really good at, ourselves. And, that's why small teams are great."</p>
<p>The developer still can't talk about the design specifics just yet, but said he has "never played a game like it" before. We do know that it is a shooter, though. "But, the things that you do in it, will be new to people, the way that going through <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-walkthrough-8042">Elden Ring</a> was a really new experience," he said.</p>
<p>"It was a very crazy place, and a different world, and it was really cool to explore it and be like 'what is that?'," Romero elaborated. "That's the idea behind what we are doing in this game."</p>

<p>As well as Doom, Romero is also known for Quake and Wolfenstein. These games all pioneered the first person shooter genre, and at GDC in 2023, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/john-romero-memoir-doom-guy-getting-not-one-but-two-screen-adaptations">Romero was the recipient of a Lifetime Achievement Award for his work</a>.</p>

<p>Puzzle platformer <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/planet_of_lana">Planet of Lana</a> launched on Switch last year, and we were particularly enamoured by it. Developer Wishfully quickly followed it up with the announcement of a sequel, '<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/planet-of-lana-ii-children-of-the-leaf">Children of the Leaf</a>', and the latest gameplay trailer promises it will be every bit as cute as we'd hope.</p>
<p>Revealed during yesterday's Unity Awards Showcase, the '<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sWoUwHXShgQ">Say hello to the Roller</a>' trailer introduces us to one of the many cute creatures you'll encounter on Lana and Mui's journey, one that possesses a particularly sticky set of skills.</p>
<p>Using Mui's transforming abilities, these cute fluff balls can stick to walls and ceilings, leave flammable trails, and roll along narrow corridors undetected. They are also really freaking cute, which is always a bonus — just try not to become too attached to them by the end of the trailer, you have been warned.</p>
<p>We still don't have an official release date for Planet of Lana 2 just yet, though Wishfully and Thunderful have confirmed that it'll be coming our way at some point in <strong>early 2026</strong>. That leaves you a good bit of time to catch up on its predecessor, if you haven't already, which we described as "a treat for the long-suffering cinematic platforming fan – perhaps even destined to join that short list of classics" in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/planet-of-lana">our review</a>.</p>

  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Three new trademarks which very much look to be related to Larian's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/divinity-original-sin-2">Divinity</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> series have been unearthed, with one closely mirroring the design of a desert monolith Geoff Keighley's posted a picture of in advance of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/event-brands/the-game-awards">The Geoff Awards</a>. That <a href="https://x.com/geoffkeighley/status/1994609007672381595">monolith teaser</a>, which Keoff captioned "regal.inspiring.thickness" has been the subject of much chatter for the past week or so, as the big showcase hype machine churns.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Enter <a href="https://mp1st.com/news/report-tga-statue-mystery-solved-new-divinity-trademark-uncovered-as-new-icon-matches-statue">MP1ST</a>, who have spotted these three logo trademarks on the website of the European Union's intellectual property office. All were applied for in relation to video games on December 9th, by German law firm Ihde &amp; Partner Rechtsanwälte. Larian Studios' name isn't mentioned in the filings, but that'd be the same law firm <a href="https://uspto.report/TM/98397930">they used</a> when applying for <a href="https://euipo.europa.eu/eSearch/#details/trademarks/017931129">previous Divinity: Original Sin trademarks</a>. </p>
<p>The <a href="https://euipo.europa.eu/eSearch/#details/trademarks/019288420">first of the trademarks</a> is the swanky new Divinity logo I've used as the featured image for this article, while you can check out the <a href="https://euipo.europa.eu/eSearch/#details/trademarks/019288427">other</a> <a href="https://euipo.europa.eu/eSearch/#details/trademarks/019288404">two</a> - which seem at a glance like they could be alternative logos - below.</p>

<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>EUIPO</cite></span></figcaption>

<p>The one on the left appears to mirror the 'eye with weird sticky outy bits' design of <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/whatisit/comments/1pgd9j2/sculpture_found_in_joshua_tree_where_is_it_from/">Geoff's mysterious monolith</a>. I think you could also reasonably describe Larian's Divinity games as having a regal, inspiring thickness to them.</p>
<p>That said, the studio's ever Tweeterly verbose publishing director Michael Douse was quick to reply to a user speculating about fresh original sin with <a href="https://x.com/Cromwelp/status/1998484634397479293">the following words</a>: "There aren't currently any plans for a new Divinity Original Sin 3 game, but once we are ready to show what we've been working on, we will." Further down in the thread, he also helpfully confirmed that Larian aren't working on or talking about a toilet simulator as of right now.</p><p>Regardless of whether these do turn out to be the harbingers of a Divinity loo experience, the timing and context seem to point to the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/baldurs-gate-iii">Baldur's Gate 3</a> developers offering more info during the Geoff Awards. If you're keen to get in a suitably divine mood while you wait to see if that's the case, here's former RPS deputy editor and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/whats-on-your-bookshelf-baldurs-gate-3-lead-writer-adam-smith">current Larian writer Adam Smith</a>'s <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/divinity-original-sin-2-review">review</a> of Divinity: Original Sin 2.</p>

            <p>As someone staring down the barrel of untangling a box of Christmas lights, I won't lie, a not tiny part of me wants to throw them in the bin and replace the whole lot with a fresh set from the shop. (I must stress, I won't be doing that. But the urge still stands.) However, Restory is a cosy game that appeals to the better angel of my nature, the part that will patiently untangle the lights so they can be enjoyed for another year.</p>
<p>Restory sets you up as the manager of a small Tokyo electronics maintenance shop at the turn of the millennium. Customers bring you broken devices to painstakingly disassemble, clean, and replace their broken parts, restoring them to working order. Though you can also order broken devices and spare parts online using your delightfully dated PC.</p>

<p>The money you earn from your work goes on rent and bills, and paying for the licenses to allow you repair more complicated and valuable tech. Though, from my time with the demo, the management side of Restory is on the lighter side – you aren't going to be adjusting the prices to undercut nearby businesses or seeking out unofficial parts to restore devices, for instance.</p>
<p>Due for release in 2026, if you head over to Steam you can take part in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3812600/ReStory_Chill_Electronic_Repairs/">Restory's first playtest</a>. I've spent an hour with the demo so far and I'm enjoying its mix of management game and simulator, but there are aspects that aren't quite gelling for me yet.</p><p>Restory's repair jobs, at least as I've discovered in the demo, are fairly simple. You disassemble a device. Slide broken parts straight into the bin under your workbench. Order new parts from your computer terminal. Clean the dirt, dust, and rust from the pieces that remain. Fit everything back together and return it to the customer. In a game about restoration, the items in your hands feel both disposable and interchangeable, even as the stories speak to the items being unique.</p>
<figure>
 


<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Rock Paper Shotgun / Tinybuild / Mandragora</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>One of the joys of other restoration cosy games, such as <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/assemble-with-care">Assemble With Care</a>, comes from fiddling with the innards of machines. Rotating camera mirrors, spooling tapes, connecting wires in an effort to diagnose the problem with the machine you're repairing. It may only be a slight puzzle to solve, but that connection with the kit in your virtual hands makes the action meditative. You contemplate the object in front of you.</p>
<p>Assemble With Care may be an unfair comparison, as you only encounter each of its objects once, making them unique within the game. Whereas Restory is a longer game in which you encounter the same device repeatedly. While the (off-brand) recreations of 2000s tech, such as a 'Pokia' 3310 and an 'Autorolla' Razor, initially inspired feelings of nostalgia, by the fifth time I was unpacking a handset that looked identical to the others that preceded it, the devices lost their lustre. If even the colourshemes of the phones or the tamagotchi were to vary it might make each repair job more distinct.</p><p>However, there is still a tonal mismatch between treatment of objects in Restory and its stories. In one, for instance, a security guard arrives at your store requesting you fix his flashlight. The torch is rare, he says, and important to him. So I buy another one online, strip it for parts and repair his flashlight to return to him. While he leaves happy, cannibalising one item to fix another seems at odds with the messaging of the game.</p>
<figure>
 


<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Rock Paper Shotgun / Tinybuild / Mandragora</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>While broadly the customer stories are enjoyably told – such as the recluse who lives above your store, who communicates with you via messages and items lowered to your window in a plastic bucket – they don't all work so well. In the listing details of an off-brand Tamogotchi on the in-game auction site, a seller writes "It was my son's. I don't understand these things… Please don't let it die. I can't get my son back, but at least his memory lives on." What could be a poignant story, instead feels cheapened for its throwaway nature compared to the time lavished on the guard who wants his flashlight fixed. Especially as you can immediately strip the toy to pieces to distribute among other broken toys.</p>
<p>What is already on Restory's workbench made for a distracting hour, but hopefully between now and release it can gain a little more variety. There is a version of running a small electronics shop – buying, restoring, and selling items to meet rent and pay bills – that could be thoroughly absorbing. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/pc-building-simulator">PC Building Simulator</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hardspace-shipbreaker">Hardspace: Shipbreaker</a>, and Trash Goblin show how diverting these kinds of granular manual work can be. It's just not yet clear if Restory will become one of them.</p>

                <p>It's been a busy week for industry speculation after <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/this-scary-the-game-awards-teaser-could-be-for-the-next-diablo-4-expansion/1100-6536594/">Geoff Keighley started posting </a>about a mysterious, glowing monolith in the middle of the California desert, which was later <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/geoff-keighleys-demonic-game-awards-monolith-has-been-spotted-in-la/1100-6536779/">moved into Los Angeles</a>. Now, it appears the monolith's mystery might have just been solved through a trademark filing.</p><p dir="ltr">Rumors that the monolith was erected to tease new Diablo 4 content, Elder Scrolls 6, God of War, or <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-game-awards-mysterious-monolith-is-not-for-lords-of-the-fallen-2/1100-6536750/">Lords of the Fallen 2</a> were <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/this-scary-the-game-awards-teaser-could-be-for-the-next-diablo-4-expansion/1100-6536594/">all shot down</a> by people in the know. While others speculated that it still could be related to The Elder Scrolls Online, or a new FromSoft game, it appears most likely that the statue is promoting a new Divinity title from Larian.</p><p dir="ltr">A trio of trademark filings were spotted up by <a href="https://mp1st.com/news/report-tga-statue-mystery-solved-new-divinity-trademark-uncovered-as-new-icon-matches-statue" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">MP1st</a>, including a new Divinity logo and a symbol that looks suspiciously like the glowing one on Geoff Keighley's monolith. The familiar-looking trademarks come after Larian's publishing director said <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/divinity-original-sin-3-not-happening-now-at-larian-or-toilet-simulator/1100-6536810/">there aren't currently any plans for a Divinity: Original Sin 3</a>, meaning the upcoming title may be a new Divinity game outside of the Original Sin prequel series.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15975876/4620211-divinitytrademarks.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4620211" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="4304" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15975876/4620211-divinitytrademarks.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4620211"></a><figcaption>The logos trademarked bear a striking resemblance to the monolith's imagery.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15975876/4620211-divinitytrademarks.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">A recent PlayStation Store <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/divinity-original-sin-3-not-happening-now-at-larian-or-toilet-simulator/1100-6536810/">database leak revealed</a> that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/divinity-original-sin-ii/">Divinity: Original Sin 2</a> is getting a Definitive Edition release on the PS5, but it's likely that the statue and the new trademark filings relate to a brand new title in the Divinity series.</p><p dir="ltr">The Game Awards is not far away now, airing on December 11 live from Los Angeles. Despite being over two years old now, Larian's Baldur's Gate 3 is up for an award again, earning another nomination for Best Community Support. This year's frontrunner looks to be Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, which earned a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/the-game-awards-nominees-ranked-by-how-many-nominations-they-received/2900-7267/">record-breaking 12 nominations</a>.

            <p>New trademarks for the Divinity franchise have been spotted online ahead of The Game Awards, leading fans to believe the mystery of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-game-awards-statue-fromsoftware-lords-of-the-fallen-studio">Geoff's demonic statue in the Mojave Desert</a> has finally been cracked.</p>
<p>As spotted by <a href="https://mp1st.com/news/report-tga-statue-mystery-solved-new-divinity-trademark-uncovered-as-new-icon-matches-statue">mp1st</a>, trademarks for a Divinity logo and two icons have been <a href="https://euipo.europa.eu/eSearch/#details/trademarks/019288427">registered in Europe</a>. One icon, with its glowing orb and spindly leg design, certainly resembles the statue. Fans have therefore quickly jumped to the conclusion of Larian announcing <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/divinity-original-sin">Divinity: Original Sin</a> 3 later this week.</p>
<p>Yet those hopes have been somewhat dashed by Larian's director of publishing Michael Douse. "There aren't currently any plans for a new Divinity: Original Sin 3 game but once we are ready to show what we've been working on we will," he responded on social media.</p>

<figure>

<p>So what does this relate to? Douse's reply is in response to a leak of a PS5 Definitive Edition of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/divinity-original-sin-2">Divinity: Original Sin 2</a>, Larian's 2017 RPG it developed before <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-a-critical-success-with-critical-failures">Baldur's Gate 3</a> that released on PC, PS4, Xbox One, and Switch. "Hey we weren't meant to announce that yet," wrote Douse.</p>
<div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><p dir="ltr" lang="en">There aren't currently any plans for a new Divinity Original Sin 3 game but once we are ready to show what we've been working on we will 🙏</p>— Very AFK (@Cromwelp) <a href="https://twitter.com/Cromwelp/status/1998484634397479293?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 9, 2025</a></blockquote></div>
<p><span data-type="targeting">

</p></div>

<p>So does that mean the trademarks relate to this new edition of Original Sin 2? Or is Larian working on a new game in the Divinity franchise, just not Original Sin 3?</p>
<p>The Divinity franchise began with Larian's 2002 game <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/divine-divinity">Divine Divinity</a>, and has received seven entries so far.</p>

<p>Larian founder and CEO Swen Vincke previously announced the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/larians-next-game-wont-be-a-baldurs-gate-3-sequel-dlc-or-anything-with-dungeons-dragons">studio's next game won't be Baldur's Gate 4</a>, nor will it be related to Dungeons &amp; Dragons. It will be "still familiar enough, but different," <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/larians-next-game-will-have-different-tone-style-way-of-doing-it-to-baldurs-gate-3-but-wont-dwarf-it">Vincke told Eurogamer</a>, while the "tone, style, way of doing it, are for us certainly new - and I think very appealing."</p><p>It's unclear what Larian is working on next, though it seems a return to Divinity shouldn't be ruled out. Either way, following the phenomenal success of Baldur's Gate 3, the studio's next game is hugely anticipated - and certainly worthy of a demonic statue.</p>

<p>The change comes after this year's entry - Call of Duty <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-7">Black Ops 7</a>, which succeeded 2024's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/call-of-duty-2024">Black Ops 6</a> - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-review">received negative feedback from critics and players</a>, in addition to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-european-sales-are-63-down-on-battlefield-6-and-50-down-on-black-ops-6">concerning sales reports across the industry</a>.</p>

<p>In a blog post shared last night, <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2025/12/call-of-duty-message-from-the-team">the Call of Duty team</a> - which includes studios Treyarch, Sledgehammer, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/infinity-ward">Infinity Ward</a> and Raven Software - acknowledged that the franchise had "not met" many players' expectations in recent times.</p>
<p>"With respect to Black Ops 7, we set our sights to deliver a spiritual successor to Black Ops 2 and the studios have poured their passion into making a great game that all of us are very proud of. But it's one thing for us to say it, more importantly it's up to you to try it and judge for yourselves," it said.</p><p>As such, the Call of Duty team is going to be making some adjustments to its strategy from now. First off, it is opening up <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/black-ops-7-zombies-dark-ops-challenges">Black Ops 7's multiplayer zombies mode</a> for a free trial and Double XP weekend next week. This is in order to allow anyone who has been on the fence about Black Ops 7 to "experience the game firsthand and decide" for themselves.</p>
<p>The Call of Duty team is also committing to "unprecedented season support" for Black Ops 7, saying it "won't rest" until the game "earns its place as one of the best Black Ops games we've ever made".</p>
<p>In addition, the studios said there will be no back-to-back releases of either Black Ops or Modern Warfare (which it did in 2022 and 2023) from now on.</p>
<p>"The reasons are many, but the main one is to ensure we provide an absolutely unique experience each and every year," the team wrote. "We will drive innovation that is meaningful, not incremental. While we aren't sharing those plans today, we look forward to doing so when the time is right."</p>
<p>It believes the franchise's future is "strong" and that its "best days are ahead of us given the depth and talent" of its development teams.</p>
<p>"We have been building the next era of Call of Duty, and it will deliver precisely on what you want along with some surprises that push the franchise and the genre forward," the blog closed. "We look forward to welcoming you in, listening to you, and moving forward together."</p>

<p>Black Ops 7 recently came under fire for its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-players-call-out-awful-apparent-use-of-generative-ai-for-in-game-calling-cards">apparent use of generative AI</a>. This matter was then brought up by US Congressman Ro Khanna who <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/even-members-of-the-us-congress-are-pushing-back-against-call-of-duty-black-ops-7s-ai-use">responded to Activision Blizzard's AI use in Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 by highlighting the need for AI regulations in the United States of America</a>.</p>
<p>For more, our Connor recently spoke to analyst Rhys Elliott and The Game Business' Chris Dring about <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-sales-expert-opinion">why Call of Duty Black Ops 7 failed to hit the mark this year</a>.</p>

			<p>It's no secret that <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-ps5-campaign-review-better-together/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</a> wasn't able to stand up to Battlefield 6 (and ARC Raiders). Even before release, the comparison between the two was unfavorable for Activision's game, and that proved to be correct once the two games launched. Black Ops 7 immediately <a href="https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-out-now-immediately-called-out-for-ai-slop/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">received criticism</a> for its inclusion of AI-generated 'slop' assets used for in-game rewards. Later, we learned that, at least in Europe, Black Ops 7's launch sales <a href="https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-trails-battlefield-6-eu-launch-sales-and-black-ops-6-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fell short of Battlefield 6's by 63%</a>.</p>



<p>The development team has now acknowledged the wave of criticism <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2025/12/call-of-duty-message-from-the-team" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in a detailed blog post</a>. They explained that going forward, Call of Duty won't launch 'back-to-back' releases in the same subseries, like Modern Warfare or Black Ops, in an attempt to provide a more unique experience with each new title. That's what used to happen; as recently as between 2019 and 2021, the three main studios (Infinity Ward, Treyarch, and Sledgehammer Games) released Modern Warfare, Black Ops Cold War, and Vanguard. However, in the last four years, we got Modern Warfare 2 and 3 (by Infinity Ward and Sledgehammer Games, respectively), and then Black Ops 6 and 7, both of which were developed by Treyarch (with the help of Raven Software). In 2026, the ball should be back in Infinity Ward's court, and in 2027, Sledgehammer is rumored to be launching a new subseries.</p>



<p>The Call of Duty studios also vowed to 'drive meaningful, not incremental' innovation in the future, although what that looks like for a fairly formulaic series like this one remains to be seen. Anyway, the developers aren't going to abandon this year's release. In fact, they're saying that Season 01 is the 'largest live season ever' and that the game will receive 'unprecedented seasonal support until Black Ops 7 earns its place as one of the best Black Ops games'. A lofty goal, to be sure. In the meantime, there will be a free trial and a Double XP weekend for Black Ops 7 Multiplayer and Zombies next week.</p>



<p>If you're planning to use the trial to try the game on PC, you may want to check the <a href="https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-pc-performance-benchmarks-the-fps-mason-what-do-they-mean/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">benchmarks article written by our Hardware team</a>.</p>
