There's no release date for the game yet, but you can wishlist it on Steam starting today.&nbsp;</p><p>Chains of Lukomorye comes from Forge Ahead Games, a small European indie studio.

            <p>A <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dune-awakening">Dune: Awakening</a> Reddit AMA has provided insight into when the next major update may be coming, as well as a firm stance on the design direction of the PvP endgame.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/duneawakening/comments/1lehj35/official_dune_awakening_launch_ama_with_funcom/">AMA</a> was handled by Funcom developers including creative director Joel Bylos. It was Bylos who responded to questions regarding the endgame PvP, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dune-awakening-pvp-is-being-dominated-by-one-busted-technique-crushing-people-with-helicopters">which has proven controversial</a> among those torn on the orniphopter-laden meta that has formed in the game's opening weeks.</p>
<p>When asked whether the team was considering removing missile launchers for scout orniphopters - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dune-awakening-early-meta-helicopter-infested-nightmare">the source of much ire</a> - Bylos responded with considerations from the team.</p>

<p>"Equipping a Scout Ornithopter with rocket Pods [could] reduce overall maneuverability and max speed. This will help solidify this module selection as a desire to engage in combat and balance it versus other combat-focused vehicles," said Bylos. He also noted other ideas, like an increased impact on the scout orniphopters' heat when shooting missiles, as well as a baseline speed increase to orniphopters with boosters equipped to make escaping easier.</p>
<p>As for the overall endgame experience, Bylos expanded his thoughts as to explain more macro goals the team desire.</p>
<p>"We want players to make meaningful decisions about what they bring with them and how they outfit their vehicles," Bylos stated. "Once players have engaged in PvP, we want the experience to be reliable, responsive, and clearly understood. This determines how PvP as a whole feels and how players make their moment to moment decisions in a fight."</p>
<p>Bylos would conclude by addressing concerns regarding connection-related troubles: "To ensure a more reliable experience in ground combat, we are continuing to address issues with movement desyncs and rubber banding, as well as ability activation reliability."</p>
<p>When asked whether or not a Deep-Desert-style zone without vehicles was being considered, Bylos outright stated no, elaborating: "a lot of our adjustments and balancing are going to drive combat towards the core vision, which is people competing over points of interest in the Deep Desert". Bylos continued: "The current balance between vehicles and on-foot is not tuned to our liking and there are multiple changes in the pipeline to address this (above and beyond bugs we will fix)."</p>
<p>So it's certainly been made clear that quality of life changes are being worked on, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dune-awakening-patch-ends-the-reign-of-vehicular-terror-as-ramming-into-other-players-no-longer-deals-damage">like the removal of vehicle ramming damage in PvP</a>, the team stood firm for their ideas on how the Deep Desert works. Which is good, in my opinion. Filing down this "vision", as Bylos puts it, risks removing a substantial amount of character from the game.</p>
<p>The AMA wasn't just focused on PvP! Other interesting tidbits were revealed by the team, such as a quality-of-life update coming in July, the fact that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dune-awakening-new-maps-hagga-basin">major Dune: Awakening updates</a> are planned to release every three-four months with new PvE and story stuff to play through, as well as plans to add new contracts to the game.</p>
<p>In Eurogamer's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dune-awakening-review">Dune: Awakening review</a>, the endgame was described glowingly: "It feels less like structured group activities you'd see in a traditional MMORPG raid, and more like grouping up in Classic WoW for a world boss. Or joining a hunt train in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-xiv-a-realm-reborn">Final Fantasy 14</a>. It's organic community play, something that forms bonds, strong friendships, and undoubtedly tense rivalries."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>This is the second of the team's zombie games to get the remake treatment. However, reception to the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/house-of-the-dead-remake-heading-to-playstation-5-this-week">first House of the Dead: Remake's reception was pretty mixed</a>.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/house-of-the-dead-film-in-the-works-from-resident-evil-monster-hunter-director">The House of the Dead is also set for the big screen, with Paul WS Anderson</a> on board to write and direct. Anderson will also serve as a producer, alongside his partner Jeremy Bolt. The duo have also worked on adaptations for the likes of Mortal Kombat (1995) and Monster Hunter (2020), as well as multiple Resident Evil films.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/games/689596/astro-bot-director-playstation-icon-gdc-2025<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p><em>Astro Bot</em> is filled with whimsy and silliness that makes you want to pay attention to the details. But in a presentation at this year’s Game Developers Conference, director Nicolas Doucet shared one particular aspect of Astro the robot that I hadn’t noticed but blew me away.</p><p>Doucet talked about how Team Asobi worked hard to give the game a good tempo with things like enemy placement and how you can interact with Astro’s spaceship with the DualSense’s gyro controls on loading screens. One thing that kept the momentum going was Astro himself and how he shows his impatience. Doucet showed a video of one idle animation where Astro is hopping up and down on his feet and pointing forward, almost like a little kid that’s demanding you go to the playground. </p><p>It’s adorable — and was added “very, very late” in development, Doucet says when I chat with him a few weeks after the presentation. While a lot of games have characters simply breathing or looking left to right while they’re idle, Team Asobi thought that it could do something a little more fun. Since the game is about rescuing characters, the team started to tie the animations to the idea of looking around, Doucet says. The team even reduced the amount of time it takes for the animations to show as a way to more quickly remind the player of the goal to find the bots. Doucet thinks of this as a subliminal way to put players in the mood to move faster.</p><p>Astro actually originates from a 2013 PS4 pack-in game called <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10000974"><em>The Playroom</em></a> that used the PS4 camera. In that game, the robot is named Asobi, but he looks a lot like the charming Astro from <em>Astro Bot</em>: Asobi has big blue eyes and a cute, pudgy robot body. “Back then, the design of the character came from two angles,” Doucet says. One was that the development team didn’t have much time, so they went for a simple character design instead of a human that might require a lot of facial animations.</p><p>But they also picked a robot because of where it would be making its debut: a preinstalled game on (at the time) new Sony hardware. When you think about Sony or PlayStation, Doucet says that there is an “aspiration to the future” or something “a little bit science fiction.” Team Asobi uses the term “techno magic.” The robot’s design came from that: “we wanted the playful fun character, but also coupled with something really cool and futuristic.”</p><p>The PS5 hardware and Astro might share a lot of similarities — white plastic with black parts and blue lights — but that’s an accident, Doucet says. Instead, both the character designers and hardware team were following similar values.</p><p>While it’s flattering to hear that people treat Astro as PlayStation’s mascot, Doucet says that wasn’t the design team’s original intention for the character. Instead, a mascot needs to be something that “grows naturally” and something that the users decide or feel. That happens through repeated consistency and quality, Doucet believes.</p><p>In retrospect, the awards for the game — including Game of the Year at The Game Awards — are well deserved, but the goal was primarily to put platformers and family-friendly games back on the map and release “as good a game as we can.” Doucet used to look at renowned PlayStation studios like Naughty Dog (<em>Uncharted</em>, <em>The Last of Us</em>) and Santa Monica Studio (<em>God of War</em>), and think they knew some kind of “black magic” that Team Asobi didn’t.</p><p>But following <em>Astro Bot</em>, the takeaway was that “actually, it became the sum of lots of small things that are carefully made.” If the team keeps that consistency and makes sure that “every bit” of the game is done as well as possible, then “the sum of it ends up being high quality.” No wonder Astro is impatient to explore. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>While prowling the ramparts of this year's Summer Game Fest, I rode a zipline to a broken attic window and snuck into a sealed chamber containing <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/thick-as-thieves">Thick As Thieves</a>, the unofficial <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-multiplayer-games-on-pc">multiplayer</a> Thief game from Otherside Entertainment. Also in the sealed chamber: celebrated Looking Glass dude and Deus Exman Warren Spector, who walked us through a hands-off demo of the PvPvE heisting sim.</p>
<p>I didn't, if I'm honest, see much that wasn't broadly covered by Jeremy Peel's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/warren-spector-and-thiefs-game-director-are-making-a-multiplayer-immersive-sim-called-thick-as-thieves">write-up of Thick As Thieves from last December</a>. As such, I'm in two minds about whether to do a full impressions piece - this news article is testing the waters. But I did turn up a few objects of novelty. For one, the new multiplayer burgling sim features an ability that lets you pose temporarily as an NPC, as with the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/semblance">Semblance</a> power in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dishonored">Dishonored</a>: Death Of The Outsider. For another, it turns out that when you rob a joint, you can leave a knavish calling card for other players hunting the same treasure. </p>
<p>It's possible, Spector told me, that you'll be able to customise your calling cards, beyond just displaying your player alias. Being a fundamentally vindictive person, I already have a few ideas for what I'd write on mine.</p>

<p>Naturally, a topic like this demands the attention of the full Treehouse. I asked our <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/come-say-hello-to-mark-warren-rpss-new-senior-staff-writer">recently recruited</a> newsfiend Mark what he'd put on his card, and he suggested transcribing the entirety of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ria37d9mInY">this Seinfield video</a> into the textbox. James, our hardware Gandalf, came back with "didn't expect weak foe". Reviews reassembler Brendy had the pithiest and, I think, most obnoxious proposal: "first".</p>
<p>But you, reader dear - what would you leave on your catburgling calling card?</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

    <p><span>Join forces with Saber and Archer in the Fate/stay night collaboration.</span>
      </p></div><div><p>The version 3.4 update for <em><a title="Games > Honkai: Star Rail [39 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/honkai-star-rail">Honkai: Star Rail</a></em>, dubbed “For the Sun is Set to Die,” will launch on July 2, developer <a title="Companies > miHoYo [198 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/mihoyo">miHoYo</a> announced. <span id="more-975048"></span></p><p>Here is an overview of the update, via miHoYo:</p><blockquote><p>In this update, Phainon and the Trailblazer will stand together at the crossroads of destiny, ready to take a decisive step that may ignite the dawn of the Era Nova. At the same time, three new playable characters—Phainon, Saber, and Archer—will make their long-awaited debut. Each brings a unique background and combat style to the battlefield, adding new depth and flair to this epic journey. Across the version, a slate of limited-time events, feature optimizations, and fresh content promises to challenge expectations and stir excitement in every corner of the galaxy.</p><p>Picking up where the story left off, the Chrysos Heirs gave everything they had, <a title="Genres > Racing [252 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/racing">racing</a> against time to help the Trailblazer and Phainon return the final Coreflame to the Vortex of Genesis. As the veils shrouding Amphoreus begin to lift, one truth becomes undeniable: things were never as simple as they seemed. What unfolds next reaches far beyond a single world—the dawn of the Era Nova may echo across the stars. And in the wake of it all, the Trailblazer’s choices could shape the very destiny of the universe itself.</p><p>In the upcoming main story, the long-awaited Phainon will finally join the Trailblazer’s team as a key ally. Born in Aedes Elysiae, he was among the first Chrysos Heirs to extend goodwill to the Trailblazer upon their arrival in Amphoreus. In the face of ever-mounting danger, he has repeatedly stepped forward to shield others from the storm. Behind his calm and reliable demeanor, however, lies the burden of great expectations. In Version 3.4, players will venture deep into Aedes Elysiae alongside the Trailblazer, tracing Phainon’s journey—from his rise as a warrior, to joining the Flame-Chase, and ultimately becoming the person he is today. During combat, Phainon can accumulate “Coreflames” through various means. Once he reaches a certain number of “Coreflames,” he can unleash his Ultimate to transform and create a “Territory,” battling enemies in a powerful new form. His combat power greatly increases. While transformed, allies temporarily leave the battlefield, but their bonus effects remain active. Upon transforming using Coreflames, Phainon unlocks new abilities, channeling the powers of Origination, Calamity, and the Foundation Titans. It’s worth mentioning that when Phainon is in the team, the team’s Technique Point cap increases. His Technique can instantly defeat normal enemies within a certain range without triggering combat. This will make exploring the map and adventuring across worlds much easier.</p><p>Beyond Amphoreus, Penacony too shall unfold its magnificent story: Recently, Trailblazer received a mysterious letter from Old Oti, head of the Alfalfa Family, an invitation to join a special entertainment program called “Sweet Dreams and the Holy Grail War.” This Holy Grail War will take place in Penacony, where seven invited participants will summon Penacony’s historical figures as Servants to fight alongside them. In addition to the Trailblazer, familiar names like Aventurine, Mr. Boothill, and Miss Robin will also appear as contestants. At the same time, three legendary Heroic Spirits will respond to the Holy Grail’s call: Saber, Archer, and Lancer. How will this dazzling and unpredictable “Sweet Dreams and the Holy Grail War” unfold? Who will form a contract with whom? The Trailblazer can uncover all these mysteries firsthand. The <em>Honkai: Star Rail</em> × <em><a title="Series > Fate [67 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/series/fate">Fate</a>/stay night [Unlimited Blade Works]</em> collaboration special story—Trailblaze Continuance “Sweet Dreams and the Holy Grail” and the event “Fate/stay night” will officially go live on July 11. Stay tuned!</p></blockquote><!-- AD: content -->
        <div id="carousel_975052"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><blockquote><p>It is also worth noting that Saber will be joining as a playable character in this collaboration. Saber is a 5-star Wind-type character following the Path of Destruction. Her Ultimate, “Excalibur,” deals massive Wind DMG to all enemies and converts her Basic ATK into an enhanced Basic ATK that also targets all enemies. During combat, Saber can accumulate “Core Resonance” through her Technique, Basic ATKs, or when allies use their Ultimates. Once she accumulates enough, she will immediately gain an extra action. Using her Skill at this moment consumes all accumulated “Core Resonance,” increases the Skill’s damage, and instantly refills the Energy required for her Ultimate.</p><p>At the same time, Archer will also be available as a playable character to assist players in battling powerful enemies during the Holy Grail War and the subsequent cosmic adventures. Archer is a Quantum-type character following the Path of the Hunt, skilled at dealing sustained single-target damage through repeated Skill use. When his Skill is activated and he enters the “Circuit Connection” state, casting the Skill will not end his turn. He can continue to use it until all Skill Points are depleted. With each additional cast, the damage increases accordingly. Upon using his Ultimate, Archer will recite the classic chant to activate “Unlimited Blade Works,” unleashing a powerful strike against a single enemy and gaining Special Charge. As the battle continues, whenever an ally attacks, Archer can consume this Charge to trigger a Follow-up ATK and restore 1 Skill Point for the team.</p><p>Starting from July 11, once the collaboration event begins and until the end of Version 3.6, Trailblazers who log in will be able to claim Archer, the limited 5-star collaboration character, for free. It’s worth mentioning here that the character and Light Cone collab banners will be available long-term after the event starts.</p><p>Version 3.4 brings not only the return of many popular characters, but also all-anticipated enhancements and stunning new looks for familiar faces. In the first half of the update, limited 5-star characters Tribbie, Sunday, and Sparkle will return for a limited time. In the second half, Firefly, Jingliu, and Blade will return as well. Even more excitingly, Silver Wolf, Blade, Kafka, and Jingliu will receive substantial enhancements, including adjustments to battle mechanics and Eidolon effects. Notably, players will also be able to freely switch between classic and enhanced combat modes, allowing for flexible gameplay tailored to individual preferences and playstyles. Additionally, Firefly’s brand-new outfit, Spring Missive, will make its debut in this update, bringing a fresh look to this beloved Stellaron Hunter.</p><p>And that’s not all. The long-awaited “skip dialogue” feature, which was previously announced, is finally going live in Version 3.4, letting players freely choose the pace of storytelling based on their own preferences. The all-familiar minigame “Origami Bird” will make a strong comeback, adding a touch of lively fun to the update.</p></blockquote><p><em>Honkai: Star Rail</em> is available now for <a title="Platforms > PS5 [9,778 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps5">PlayStation 5</a>, <a title="Platforms > PC [23,544 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> via <a href="https://hsr.hoyoverse.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">client download</a> and <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/p/honkai-star-rail" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Epic Games Store</a>, iOS via <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/honkai-star-rail/id1599719154" target="_blank" rel="noopener">App Store</a>, and Android via <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.HoYoverse.hkrpgoversea&amp;hl=en_US&amp;gl=US" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Google Play</a>.</p><p>Watch a new trailer and special program below.

            <p>Limited Run Games has requested Nintendo temporarily remove its Gex Trilogy from the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-review-of-the-switch-2-as-much-as-you-can-review-a-new-console-after-a-weekend-in-its-company">Switch 2</a> eShop.</p>
<p>The Gex Trilogy, which bundles together the cult-classic 90s platformer Gex and its two sequels, launched earlier this week across PC, PlayStation 5, PS4, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, and both Switch consoles.</p>

<p>But while things appear to have gone swimmingly across most platforms, the trilogy wasn't working as intended on Switch 2. A number of Limited Run Games titles which run on its Carbon Engine had compatibility issues with the new console, however a recent firmware update released by Nintendo last night resolved the majority of these. But, alas, the Gex Trilogy was not one of them.</p>
<p>Sharing an <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/limitedrungames.com/post/3lrxtpy5kw627">update on social media</a>, Limited Run Games said: "Since we do not have clarity on when Gex Trilogy on Switch 2 will be fixed in firmware, we submitted our own patch last week to correct the issue."</p>
<p>However, due to the Juneteenth holiday across the pond, this patch is still awaiting approval. While Limited Run Games hopes to issue the patch early next week, it has requested Nintendo for the time being removes the game from the Switch 2 eShop.</p>
<p>"Thank you for your patience as we work with Nintendo to resolve these issues," Limited Run Games wrote, before sharing a list of its games that are now Switch 2 compatible following that aforementioned firmware update.</p>
<p>This list is as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Clock Tower: Rewind</li>
<li>Jurassic Park Classic Games Collection</li>
<li>Tomba! Special Edition</li>
<li>River City Girls Zero</li>

			<p>Sniper Elite was never really the most obvious option for a zombie spin-off. I mean, generally speaking if a zombie is far enough away for you to be sniping them, you’ve got a good 30 minutes of shambling before they’re a threat to you anyway. Not to mention that you don’t want to spend time watching the gory, bone-crunching details of your precisely placed sniper round making its way through a zombie skull when there’s the rest of the horde still to go, and they’re getting closer. On the other hand, I do love shooting zombies. Also, I quite like VR, so Zombie Army VR should be right up my alley.</p>
<p><iframe title="Zombie Army VR – Launch Trailer | PS VR2, Meta Quest Platforms &amp; PCVR" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ghv_WBpjx8Y?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Zombie Army VR is so self explanatory it almost defies description. There’s a Nazi zombie apocalypse at the end of World War 2, and so you’ve got to use World War 2 weapons to blast them. Sure there’s technically a story going on in the background, but you’re probably not paying it much attention – in previous games this was because it’s just a thin excuse to shoot zombies, but now it’s also because you’re in VR and you’re poking the poor officer in charge of you in the eyeball with the barrel of your sniper rifle whilst he’s giving his briefing.</p>


<p>At any given moment, you have a sniper rifle, a secondary weapon, usually an automatic like a Thompson, and a pistol. You’ll unlock new options as you find them in game and they can be upgraded with packs that you find in levels as well. You also have three consumable slots which you can use to carry items like healing kits (which are injectors here), grenades, mines, and other kinds of traps. Using these you’re going to fight through a horde of zombies in a style that is, despite being set in World War 2 times, almost identical to every other zombie shooter you’ve played in VR. With that said, you will already know if this style of game is still interesting to you, or if you think it’s all been done to (un)death by now.</p>


<p>It’s not bad if you’re into this kind of thing and just like killing zombies, but Zombie Army VR’s most remarkable quality is how unremarkable it actually is. The only unique feature is the X-ray killcam that has been adapted from the flatscreen games. Something has been lost in translation though, as bullets often just clip through skulls without leaving a hole behind, or a hole just appears in a different part of the skull. Without that feature to differentiate this from other VR zombie games, it’s just a bog standard game where voices chunner at you for a minute before you go out and kill more zombies.</p>
<p>The shooting works just fine, reloading works fine too, using the ammo belt-eject mag-pull slide method you’ve used a thousand times before. Occasionally, doors will be blocked by shadowy stuff until you kill all the zombies in the room in a slightly cheap way of trying to put on pressure on you as zombies just spawn into the room. I’ve never liked this mechanic; it’s much better tackling an enemy when they’re in a particular place and you can plan an approach, and it’s far less interesting to just have them appearing around you like a shooting gallery.</p>

<p>It even has the typical big moments you’d expect from a zombie shooter, like the moment where you temporarily get a massive machine gun turret to mow down a large amount of enemies. It’s just all the same stuff. Again, it’s not bad by any stretch, it’s just not particularly inspired. If this game was released a few years ago before the cascade of other zombie shooters, it would probably be considered very good, but with other games like <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/12/06/arizona-sunshine-2-review/">Arizona Sunshine 2</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/12/14/after-the-fall-review-psvr-meta-quest-steamvr-vive/">After the Fall</a>, Zombie Army just feels a little too…obvious. At least you can play it in co-op, which should help breathe some life into it a bit, but again, both of the aforementioned VR zombie games also feature co-op and are more interesting to play.</p>

		<p>Summary</p><p>
		There isn't much to say about Zombie Army VR. It's not bad, but it also doesn't stand out from the zombie shooter hordes, and it even fumbles the series' only truly distinctive feature, the X-ray killcams. It's a by the numbers zombie shooter in VR that might be enjoyable enough if zombie shooting if your gaming version of comfort food, but there are better options out there.	</p></div>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-lossless-scaling-2x-comparable-dlss-4-frame-generation/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/cyberpunk-2077-lossless-scaling-3-2-comparison-highlights-how-x2-mode-is-now-comparable-to-nvidia-dlss-4-frame-generation.1223841/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-lossless-scaling-2x-comparable-dlss-4-frame-generation/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Lossless Scaling, the PC app that brings frame generation to games that don't officially support it, has been making some great progress lately, and with the improvements introduced in the latest 3.2 version, the 2x option is now pretty close to NVIDIA DLSS Frame Generation, at least in Cyberpunk 2077.</p>
<p>A recent video by&nbsp;<a href="https://www.youtube.com/@thefeaj" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Feaj</a>&nbsp;compares every frame generation option offered by the latest version of the application, now available on&nbsp;<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/993090/Lossless_Scaling/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam,</a> with NVIDIA Smooth Motion and NVIDIA DLSS 4 Frame Generation and Multi Frame Generation.&nbsp;While the x3 and x4 Lossless Scaling options are, unsurprisingly, inferior to DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation in terms of image quality and input lag, the video highlights how the 2x option is now pretty close to regular DLSS 4 Frame Generation in terms of input delay, with only some minor artifacting setting the two apart. Compared to NVIDIA Smooth Motion, however, Lossless Scaling seems to be the superior option, as the slightly better input lag offered by NVIDIA's tech is offset by its low image quality, compared to Lossless Scaling. As such, the app continues to be an excellent choice for those using NVIDIA GPUs that don't support Frame Generation and older games that will never get official Frame Generation support.</p>
<p><iframe title="Lossless Scaling 3.2 VS Nvidia Multi Frame Generation VS Smooth Motion + Setup Guide" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FXLzX_anyEs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Cyberpunk 2077 was among the first games to receive support for NVIDIA DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation. Exclusively available on the RTX 50 series GPUs, the next evolution of the technology introduced initially on the RTX 40 series GPUs can deliver up to<a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-dlss-4-8x-faster-dlss-3-multi-frame-generation-enhanced-upscaling-rtx-20-above/"> 8x performance</a> in supported titles, whose number continues to increase <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-dlss-4-multi-frame-generation-gets-added-to-marvels-spider-man-2-mecha-break-rematch-and-dragonkin-the-banished/">weekly</a>.

"Full loot is a decree that can be obtained via the Landsraad (so compete there if you want to make it a reality), there are control points in the deep desert already, we have no plans to reduce the DD size.

"Once players have engaged in PvP, we want the experience to be reliable, responsive, and clearly understood. This determines how PvP as a whole feels and how players make their moment-to-moment decisions in a fight. To ensure a more reliable experience in ground combat, we are continuing to address issues with movement desyncs and rubber banding, as well as ability activation reliability."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There's also some quality of life tweaks on the way, too, including named storage containers and vehicles, to help you differentiate, as well as "deposit/extract all" buttons for water storages and the like.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/reminder-you-can-use-non-nintendo-usb-cameras-with-switch-2<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section>
<figure><a title="usb camera article" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/03c6d943f55be/usb-camera-article.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Check out the official details for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/nintendo-switch-2-guide-ultimate-resource">Switch 2</a> USB camera compatibility on <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Hardware/Nintendo-Switch-2/Nintendo-Switch-2-USB-Cameras-2785632.html?srsltid=AfmBOoq6zK5mTXSBzpSY011GVRE952hwn0jSzgAUKbx6ToaOJmHWyDEh">Nintendo's website</a> and you'll be greeted with a surprisingly straightforward message from the Big N stating that, "You can use the Nintendo Switch 2 camera accessory (sold separately) or any compatible USB-C camera you'd like." Nice!</p>
<p>Of course, the reality is that nothing is ever quite so easy; Nintendo does qualify that some cameras may not work and you'll need to use the handy compatibility test found in the new console's settings. This is great, but not much use when you haven't bought the camera yet.</p>
<p>As it turns out, choosing a camera — besides <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2-camera-an-elegant-but-nonessential-gamechat-companion">the official one</a>, or the not-quite-as-good <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2-piranha-plant-camera-shocking-image-quality-but-its-cuteness-will-snare-you">Hori Piranha Plant one</a>, or <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/04/horis-new-switch-2-camera-is-built-for-handheld-play">the other Hori one</a> — can actually be a little bit of a complicated task. Some cameras work, some don't. Simple as that.</p>
<p>And so, as ever, enthusiastic gamers have been stepping into the breach, compiling master lists of Switch 2-compatible cameras that you can browse and/or add to with your own findings, and there are quite a few popular brands popping up in "Not Compatible" sections thus far.</p>
<p>As pointed out at the very top of <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch2/comments/1l5mgn0/tested_usb_cameras_with_switch_2_master_list/?sort=new">this ongoing master list</a> (and this was news to us), some USB-A cameras do appear to work when plugged into the dock or, with a USB-A to USB-C adapter, plugged into the Switch 2 console. New information has appeared! Indeed, in TV mode, it appears you can just directly plug into the dock to potentially use USB-A cameras you have lying around.</p>
<p>With this in mind, this writer did attempt to use a Blink Dog Security camera connected to the dock, but alas no dice.</p>
<figure><a title="usb camera article" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/64d2528759954/usb-camera-article.large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Okay, this one didn't work, though the power light did flash on and off, so that was something — <em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Looking through the Reddit list as it stands right now (which we can't vouch for, mind), you can also see some patterns developing around particular brands. Logitech has a whole bunch of cameras, ranging from cheap to expensive, that are seemingly compatible - and a shoutout to whoever it is that's been using an endoscopy cam. Good job!</p>
<p>Here are a few of the included cameras in the 'working' section with some prices (check out the thread for <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch2/comments/1l5mgn0/tested_usb_cameras_with_switch_2_master_list/">the full, growing list</a>):</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>aoni A20 - 1080p - $19</strong></li>
<li><strong>Logitech Brio 100 - 1080p - $29</strong></li>
<li><strong>Logitech Brio 105 - 1080p - $45</strong></li>
<li><strong>Logitech Brio 300 - 1080p - $39</strong></li>
<li><strong>Logitech Brio 501 - 1080p - $129</strong></li>
<li><strong>Microsoft LifeCam Cinema - 720p - $94</strong></li>
<li><strong>Razer Kiyo - 1080p - $47</strong></li>
<li><strong>Razer Kiyo Pro - 1080p - $129</strong></li>
<li><strong>WAYVOSE ‎WVS0015 Endoscope - ?</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>So there's certainly plenty of non-Nintendo gear out there that's getting the job done at various price points, it would seem.</p>
<p>In terms of cameras that won't work, well, Elgato gear seems to have been totally left out in the cold, as does Sony, Insta360, and Microsoft for the most part. There are some surprises and brand outliers, too, such as the very well-regarded (and expensive) Logitech Brio 4K, which is seemingly having issues</p>
<p>So make sure to give this list — and any others you find popping up online — a good read-through before deciding that a very nice and expensive USB-C camera you've seen should 100% do the job. It may not!</p>

<p>Eurogamer has contacted <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a> for clarification.</p>
<p>Yoshida has long warned players against using third-party plugins, which are strictly prohibited in Final Fantasy 14. He's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-14-world-first-ultimate-raid-challengers-busted-for-cheating-thanks-to-single-pixel">repeatedly called out players for cheating during Ultimate Raid challenges</a>.</p>
<p>However, the PlayerScope tool in particular has been used for nefarious intentions.</p>
<p>The plugin would allow anyone to search for a Final Fantasy 14 character name to receive that player's account details, including information of all characters on that account. Player information was also uploaded to a central server combining all data. Essentially, this allowed for in-game harassment and stalking.</p>
<p>In short, as <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxivdiscussion/comments/1hvv7k5/comment/m5w6qo1/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">one reddit user</a> put it, the plugin was a "stalker's wet dream".</p>
<p>"We strive to offer and maintain a safe environment for our players, which is why we ask everyone to refrain from using third-party tools," said Yoshida back in January.</p>
<p>In February, <a href="https://forum.square-enix.com/ffxiv/threads/515747-Letter-from-the-Producer-LIVE-Part-LXXXV-%2802-21-2025%29">Square Enix stated</a> it was making changes to how characters were blacklisted, although third-party tools were able to get around this - something the company admitted was "very problematic". While it had countermeasures in place, Square Enix did not disclose what those were.</p>
<p>Now, however, PlayerScope has been completely shut down. "This wasn't an easy decision, but it was necessary," said the tool's creator.</p>
<p>Still, while players have mostly praised the decision, some have concerns the database of player information may still exist elsewhere.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>March to the beat</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Bandai Namco has revealed a new overview trailer for the upcoming remaster of a PSP classic, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/patapon_1plus2_replay">Patapon 1+2 Replay</a>, and it looks absolutely delightful.</p>
<p>This one was initially revealed back in the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/nintendo-direct-march-2025-every-announcement-game-reveal-trailer">final Switch 1-focused Direct</a> in late March and is set to come our way on <strong>11th July</strong>.</p>
<p>Those who played either <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/psp/patapon">Patapon</a> or its sequel on PSP back in the mid-2000s won't find too many surprises in the new trailer, but if you missed out, it does a decent job of filling in the blanks. This is a rhythm game where you take control of an army of tiny one-eyed warriors, and help them journey across the land. Every command you give to your team comes in the form of drum beats, which you'll have to bash out on the buttons to make them follow your instructions.</p><p><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><a id="yt-2" title="Play" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA"></a><figcaption>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>823k</span></a></figcaption><figcaption><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></figcaption></figure></p>
<p>The new trailer runs through most of these commands while showcasing the game's controls and tactical slant, before detailing some of the gimmicks, character classes and quality of life improvements we can expect to encounter next month — shout out to the 'Drum Command Always Display' function.</p>
<p>All in all, it looks really rather sweet. Bandai Namco have assumed publishing duties on this one, but the original Patapon team are hard at work on a spiritual successor, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/ratatan">Ratatan</a>, which is <em>also</em> eyeing-up a Switch release. Man, it's a good time to be a rhythm fan!</p>

			<p>The Witcher 4 development team aims to take full advantage of the generational shift since the release of The Witcher 3, and their ambition to deliver a true next-gen experience had to be shown right from the get-go with the <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-iv-new-trailer-ps5-60-fps-ray-tracing/">tech demo</a> shown during this year's edition of Unreal Fest.</p>
<p>Speaking with <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/the-witcher/the-witcher-4-devs-are-preparing-for-a-generational-shift-after-the-witcher-3-and-theyre-studying-the-rpgs-biggest-city-to-help/">GamesRadar+</a>, Engineering Production Manager Jan Hermanowicz said that the studio is adapting to the generational shift in hardware, engines, and technology since the release of the third entry in the series. The studio wants to take full advantage of this shift to deliver a true next-generation experience.</p>
<p>This ambition had to be shown right away, which led to the showing of the village of Valdrest in The Witcher 4 tech demo. This village featured over 300 NPCs, a huge character density comparable to The Witcher 3's biggest city, Novigrad, which provided clear proof of how serious CDPR is about stepping up from the previous entry in the series. The city players get to explore as Geralt is searching for Ciri actually served as a basis for the creation of Valdrest's NPC density, according to Hermanowicz, as the team spent a lot of time looking at recordings of Novigrad, looking at what was done in the past, what worked and what couldn't be accomplished at the time. As such, the studio is definitely not stepping into upping the ante blindly, but is actually building on what was already done in the past.</p>
<p>Though just a tech demo that may not be entirely representative of the final game, The Witcher 4's first showing was indeed impressive, and not just for how alive the village of Valdrest looked. The tech demo was running on base PlayStation 4 at 60 FPS with ray tracing, and with the studio making the game with a <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-4-is-made-with-console-first-approach-60-fps-on-xbox-series-s-will-be-extremely-challenging-to-achieve-says-cdpr/">console-first approach</a>, there's no doubt that we won't see a repeat of what happened with Cyberpunk 2077's console launch, although Xbox Series S owners may not be able to enjoy the game as PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X owners, as getting the game to run at 60 FPS on the system will be extremely challenging.</p>

"Metroid Prime 4: Beyond and Metroid Prime 4: Beyond - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition are not yet available and are scheduled for release in 2025."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">IGN has been able to verify the advert currently remains in place at the station — as detailed in our original report below.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>ORIGINAL STORY:</strong> A giant advert for Metroid Prime 4: Beyond at London's Oxford Circus tube station states that the game is now available, sparking confusion from Nintendo fans on their morning commute.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">First off, if you've seen the advert yourself, no — the current London heatwave hasn't melted your senses. The advert, now spotted by multiple fans and confirmed in person by IGN staff, really does say the game is "out now".</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Officially, Nintendo has not announced a Metroid Prime 4: Beyond release date other than a vague promise it will launch this year. But even if the game isn't out now, its appearance on an advert in such a prominent location is giving Nintendo fans hope its launch is right around the corner.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"Any idea why the MP4 Beyond ad in the London Underground says 'out now'?" Nintendo fan orchestar  wrote on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/nintendo/comments/1lfnbga/metroid_prime_4_ad_in_london_underground_out_now/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reddit</a>. "I’m genuinely confused. Do they mean the Switch 2 is out? I wish the game was truly out though haha."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fans have speculated that the advert is perhaps outdated — maybe Nintendo did initially plan to launch Metroid Prime 4 now, and the wording wasn't updated? Alternatively, we could be seeing a version of the advert not due until later, alongside the game's actual release date. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">For other Nintendo fans, keen to play the game soon after many years of waiting, the advert has sparked hope of a surprise release. This does seem unlikely, however, with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/donkey-kong-bananza-confirms-super-mario-odysseys-pauline-is-your-new-sidekick-and-dk-can-now-transform-into-a-zebra-or-flying-ostrich">Donkey Kong Bananza firmly positioned as Nintendo's next big Switch 2 title</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As IGN senior commerce editor Rob Anderson told me this morning, reporting from the scene, the whole of this Oxford Circus tube platform is one long Nintendo Switch 2 advert, with individual panels for games such as Super Mario Party Jamboree, Donkey Kong Bananza and the Switch 2 console itself. Metroid Prime 4: Beyond's placement here, then, looks just to be part of a wider promotional campaign — rather than a specific placement for the individual game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">IGN has contacted Nintendo for comment.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/06/20/pxl-20250620-103943003-1750416263852.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond is "out now", according to this Oxford Circus advert.

Years later, with Switch 2 on the horizon, Nintendo finally gave the game a proper unveiling in June 2024.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">On Switch 2, Metroid Prime 4: Beyond will run at 120 frames per second and offer optional controls that take advantage of the Joy-Con's mouse feature. It seems most likely to arrive at some point between Donkey Kong Bananza's July launch and Pokémon Legends: Z-A's arrival in October.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Photo credit: Rob Anderson</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

                <p>NetEase Game has announced a new game called Blood Message, which it describes as its first "AAA" single-player experience that is under development at Naraka: Bladepoint studio 24 Entertainment.

The story focuses on a father and his son as they navigate a collapsing world and find themselves torn between duty and family.</p><p>"We are ushering players into a new generation of high adventure with Blood Message," NetEase executive VP Zhipeng Hu said in a press statement.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/06/20/ludocene-the-new-app-that-reimagines-game-discovery/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p><a href="https://www.ludocene.com/">Ludocene</a>, a new, self-styled dating app for video games, is aiming to tackle an age-old (albeit first world) problem. We’ve all been there, flicking through tatty, overstuffed CD wallets or irritably browsing digital storefronts, not really knowing what we want to play next. The unending influx of new releases doesn’t help with 19,000 titles being added to Steam alone in 2024. That sense of choice paralysis is only exacerbated further when you factor in the hoard of complimentary games shotgunned into players’ libraries on a monthly basis thanks to <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/playtstation-plus">PlayStation Plus</a>, <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/xbox-game-pass">Xbox Game Pass</a>, and other services such as <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/netflix">Netflix</a> and <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/apple-arcade">Apple Arcade</a>.</p>
<p><iframe title="Ludocene Kickstarter Video" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/sRkvfG-1et8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Ludocene wants to cut through the noise in a way that’s personalised and playful. Currently in its testing stage, the innovative web app invites users to grab a seat at its virtual table, offering them a series of cards from its ginormous deck. Each card represents a video game, complete with a blurb, trailer, and even a handy store link should you want to make a purchase. Much like a dating app, Ludocene will ask you to keep cards or discard them, each swipe helping to narrow the results of its recommendation engine.</p>


<p>While storefronts such as Steam do a passable job of suggesting similar games to what you’ve been playing, it doesn’t account for changing tastes or the fact that sometimes we want to try something completely different from the game we’ve just finished. For instance, after wrapping up <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> and <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/assassins-creed-shadows">Assassin’s Creed Shadows</a>, I wanted to play something much shorter and less demanding.</p>

<p>So, I set about swiping and quickly landed on one of TSA’s all-time favourites, <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/journey">Journey</a>. Dropping it into the “Played Favourites” box prompted Ludocene to deal me similar cards such as <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/abzu">ABZU</a> and <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/the-pathless">The Pathless</a>, as well as games I’d seemingly forgotten about like Season: A Letter to the Future. I was also presented with more obscure indie titles like Two Falls, Webfishing, and Feather, and even upcoming releases, with Sword of the Sea being the top pick.</p>
<p><iframe title="Ludocene - Game Suggestions From People You Trust" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cdyh0Mc9TXg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Once you’re satisfied with the pool of cards you’ve curated you can save it and start a new “run” from scratch. This time around, instead of smaller, zen-like experiences I wanted to play an arcade racer on PS5; filtering out driving sims and Mario Kart clones I finally landed on Split/Second. While Ludocene is great for finding new and lesser known titles, it also encourages the rediscovery of games we might already own or have played in the past. Minutes later, I was drifting through collapsing cityscapes thanks to the game being part of Sony’s streamable PlayStation Plus classics catalogue. It would be great if Ludocene’s cards could indicate whether a game is currently available via subscription services though I imagine that curating an updated database of store links and updated prices is already suitably challenging.</p>
<p>With that said, there are special theme cards you can add to your deck that augment your results if, say, you want to specifically see games being offered as part of a Netflix subscription. There are expert cards too with Ludocene assembling an Avengers-like team of tastemakers from across the gaming industry. Given the current state of games journalism – with publications closing up shop and Google directing eyeballs towards sloppy AI summaries instead of actual articles – it’s great to feel a sense of connection with actual humans giving their honest opinions.</p>
<p>So, how do you get Ludocene? For instant access to a fully-functioning prototype, you can make a late pledge <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/ludocene">over on Kickstarter</a> with a wider release planned for September 2025.</p>

                <p>Gamers have been waiting 18 years for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/metroid-prime-4-everything-we-know/1100-6492292/" data-ref-id="1100-6492292">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a> to arrive, so it was understandable when Nintendo reiterated that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/yes-metroid-prime-4-is-still-coming-out-in-2025/1100-6529216/" data-ref-id="1100-6529216">the game will be released this year</a> to assuage fears of any further delays. While the game still doesn't have an official release date, there are now ads in the London Underground that state Metroid Prime 4: Beyond is "out now."</p><p>A picture of the ad was posted on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1lfoblm/metroid_prime_4_beyond_out_now_advert_spotted_in/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Reddit</a>, where it's become the topic of speculation. But don't get too excited. It's far more likely that this is a mistake rather than Nintendo shadow dropping one of its most-anticipated titles of the year in the wake of Switch 2's launch without a proper media push.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Metroid Prime 4: Beyond - Official Gameplay Reveal Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>Nintendo didn't reveal <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/metroid-prime-4-beyond-gets-gameplay-deep-dive-slick-new-suit/1100-6530408/" data-ref-id="1100-6530408">the first trailer for Metroid Prime 4</a> until earlier this year, and there have only been a handful of glimpses since. Players will once again assume control of bounty hunter Samus Aran as she finds herself trapped on the jungle planet Viewros while facing foes and hostile terrain.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/blood-message-reveal-trailer-netease<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Blood Message, a single player narrative action game, has just been revealed by Netease Games.</p>
<p>The game is coming to PC and consoles, though no release date has been announced.</p>
<p>Developed by 24 Entertainment, the studio responsible for melee battle royale Naraka: Bladepoint, the new trailer introduces the Dunhuang's Uprising as Blood Message's setting, where your character must make a 1,000 mile trek with a crucial message in hand.</p>

<p>The trailer - which you can watch above - is a visually impressive display, showcasing plenty of third-person action across various distinct locations. While 24 Entertainment does have action experience courtesy of Naraka, this looks to be a much slower, cinematic affair.</p>
<p>An accompanying press release states Blood Message will feature: "Visceral, realistic combat blending stealth and survival mechanics", as well as "expansive landscapes inspired by the diverse terrains of East and Central Asia". In terms of gameplay comparisons, think something along the lines of The Last of Us, albeit with a close-quarters, historical focus.</p>
<p>"We are ushering players a new generation of high adventure with Blood Message," said Zhipeng Hu, lead producer and NetEase executive vice president. "As our first completely single-player focused experience from NetEase Games, after two decades of deep dedication to the gaming industry, we are prepared to deliver a truly epic and cinematic experience for players around the world."</p>
<p>We're seeing a lot of these big budget action games come from China as of late, as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/how-black-myth-wukong-has-changed-the-game-for-chinese-developers">the success of Black Myth: Wukong changed the game for the country's developers</a>. Prior to Blood Message, Phantom Blade Zero, Wuchang: Fallen Feathers, Lost Soul Aside, and Tides of Annihilation are just a handful of examples of interesting titles following the path Wukong first tread.</p>
<p>These examples have yet to release, and as such whether or not the financial and critical success of Wukong can be replicated by its contemporaries remains to be seen. Nonetheless, this wave of interesting looking games coming to the West from a historically under-represented part of the video game industry (at least as far as big budget AAA is concerned) certainly offers another avenue for exciting games to reach the hands of curious players.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p>The release of a new console is then spent burning through as many of the launch titles as humanly possible. That’s even more true if you’re us, and the days and nights at TSA Towers have been spent blearily looking at the differences between docked and undocked performance, and trying out all our old games to see if they run better (they do!). I’m genuinely really happy to have a console that is a Switch but better, and it’s made a big jump towards what we expect from current gen consoles and handhelds. I’ve been playing a heap of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/06/17/rune-factory-guardians-of-azuma-is-an-amazing-experience-on-switch-2-but-its-not-perfect/">Rune Factory: Guardians of Azuma</a>, loads of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/06/18/street-fighter-6-year-12-fighters-edition-is-a-great-port-on-the-wrong-hardware/">Street Fighter 6</a>, a spot of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/06/19/hogwarts-legacy-on-switch-2-is-a-transfigurational-new-port/">Hogwarts Legacy</a> and plenty of family Mario Kart World. Me and my wife also embarked on a highly romantic playthrough of The Last of Us Remastered, as we approach our 15 year(!) wedding anniversary. That’s true love.</p>

<p>We’re going to start with <strong>Steve</strong> this week, who’s played a wide range of titles as he hid from the fiery ball in the sky. He tells us, “I cleared the lovely Symphonia on Game Pass (highly recommend for fans of Celeste et al), the clunky but nostalgic Warhammer Space Marine MasterCrafted, finished checking out Next Fest demos and inflated my ridiculous wishlist even more. I also started the excellent Alters (although only played the part I had already done in the demo last year). Finally I got deep into Metroid Zero Mission which is still an astonishingly good game – beginning a full series playthrough to take me up to the launch of Prime 4.”</p>
<p><strong>Miguel</strong> had a busy one, playing <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/06/19/tron-catalyst-review/">TRON Catalyst</a> for our review, Elden Ring: Nightrein, Synduality: Echo of Ada, and Girls Frontline 2: Exilium!</p>


<p><strong>Gamoc</strong> returned to Atomfall for its Wicked Isle DLC, continued on with Rebellion titles with Zombie Army VR, and then waggled his arms around in Maestro for review. That wasn’t all though, as he tell us, “There was also a bit of Balatro and, miraculously, a few hours of Fallout 4 on my severely under-equipped PC over the weekend. I forgot how awesome mods are and now I don’t want to go back to console.”</p>
<p><strong>Tuffcub&nbsp;</strong> has been wrapping up our upcoming review of Death Stranding 2, but has also been playing Destiny 2, presumably. And do you know what? I’ve downloaded it so I can play it too. I was appalled by the 180Gb install mind you, but the new expansion is free on PlayStation Plus.</p>
<p>Keen for a kick-about, <strong>Aran</strong> has been playing <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/06/19/rematch-review/">Rematch</a> for review, which has some really interesting ideas on how to handle video game football, and paired that with his old standby, The Witcher 3.</p>

<p><strong>Nic B</strong> has had a heck of a week, reviewing Raidou Remastered: The Mystery of the Soulless Army, Bravely Default: Flying Fairy HD Remaster, and Survival Kids. He’s also been playing through Split Fiction on the Switch 2 (review to come) and finished Mario Kart World. I think he’s probably exhausted, as he told us, “I have no intention of ever sleeping — I am going to go make another coffee, however…”</p>
<p><strong>Jim</strong> has been juggling a few very different games this week. First up was Nobunaga’s Ambition Awakening which he says, “just didn’t hook me in the same way previous instalments have done.” Looking to cross another game off his backlog, he booted up Ancestors: The Humankind Odyssey which didn’t start out well, “I initially found it equal parts dull and frustrating, leading me to wipe the game from my PS5. However, the following day I decided to reinstall and give it another shake. With the help of a few guides (the in-game onboarding is lacking) I’m starting to enjoy the game as my primal tribe of apes gradually learn to explore, communicate, and use tools. To cap it off, I’ve been playing Rematch – the new action footie game from Sifu developer, Sloclap.”</p>
<p><strong>Ade</strong> has been on holiday in the Lake District this week with the family, so that’s meant lots of Mario Kart 8 Deluxe and Rayman Legends on the Switch for evening gaming sessions after an epic walk or two! Sounds perfect!</p>
<p>Meanwhile, <strong>Reuben</strong> has been dealing with the world being a mess by playing a lot of games set ostensibly in post-apocalyptic worlds. He tells us, “I’ve been playing FUGA 3 (review coming shortly), Shin Megami Tensei IV and Stray. The last of which I have finished and didn’t overly enjoy all that much, but SMTIV is an incredible experience, if a little on the long side.”</p>

<p>And finally,&nbsp;<strong>Tef</strong> has been continuing his charge through the Switch 2’s library. This week’s seen Yakuza 0’s hefty cutscenes occupying him, plenty of back and forth to do our Hogwarts Legacy comparison (so he could use that punny headline he thought of weeks ago), and he’s pulling together patched game thoughts as well. Is that enough to do? Hell no! That’s why he’s been playing a bit of Remedy’s quirky co-op shooter spin-off, FBC: Firebreak. It’s an…. unusual game…</p>
<p><em>What about you? What have you played?</em></p>

			<p>Unreal Engine 5.6 packs significant CPU and GPU performance improvements over version 5.4 of the engine, boding well for future games powered by the Epic engine.</p>
<p>A new comparison video shared by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@MxBenchmarkPC">MxBenchmarkPC</a> on YouTube puts the Paris Tech Demo by Scans Factory running on an RTX 5080 in Unreal Engine 5.6 and Unreal Engine 5.4 at default settings and with hardware Lumen in GPU and CPU limited scenarios side-by-side, highlighting how there are significant performance improvements in the new version of the engine in both scenarios. GPU performance is estimated to be improved by up to 25%, with the new version of the engine utilizing GPU resources better, resulting in a higher power draw as well. CPU performance, on the other hand, sees the biggest improvement in the new version of the engine, up to 35%, with more stable frametimes as well. Even in terms of image quality, Unreal Engine 5.6 brings significant improvements with more accurate Lumen lighting and higher quality Lumen reflections.</p>

<p>Unreal Engine 5.6 launched earlier <a href="https://wccftech.com/unreal-engine-5-6-now-available-open-worlds-60-fps-ray-tracing/">this month</a>, right after the annual Unreal Fest opening presentation revealed some of its central features and improvements over the previous version of the engine. Among the improvements are hardware ray tracing enhancements that boost Lumen Global Illumination performance, faster geometry streaming for smoother loading of massive static worlds, an intuitive redesign of Motion trails, and more. The launch of the new version of the engine accompanied the first public showing of a <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-iv-new-trailer-ps5-60-fps-ray-tracing/">The Wìtcher IV tech demo</a>, which served as a showcase of the features of the new version of the engine.</p>

			<p>The Nintendo Switch was on the back foot in terms of hardware power from day one. The game’s big launch title, <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</a>, felt like it <em>just barely</em> fit within the confines of the system, running at an inconsistent 30fps and a less-than-optimal pixel count. Six years later, <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/the-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</a> pushed the Switch even closer to its limits (and arguably beyond).</p>
<p>Given the games' struggles on the OG Switch, it feels appropriate that the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/nintendo-switch-2-console/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">significantly more technically adept Switch 2</a> is launching with updated versions of both Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom, which promise sharper visuals, better performance, and more. So, do these upgrades truly transform these Switch-era epics? Or are they less than legendary? Venture forth for my thoughts...</p>
<p><em>Note: This is an opinion piece and, thus, not as detailed as a full, scored review would be.</em></p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/WCCFzeldabotwswitch22.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>The original Switch versions of The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom certainly delivered in terms of style, mood, and sense of scale, but you usually weren’t rewarded for examining anything too closely, with an unflattering combination of soft details and jagged edges affecting many environments and objects.</p>
<p>The new versions of Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom sharpen things up considerably, bumping the resolution to a native 1440p docked and 1080p in handheld mode. That resolution is likely somewhat dynamic, but to my eye, it looked to occupy the higher end of the scale most of the time. Combined with HDR, the resolution bump results in an overall more vibrant, engaging presentation. Individual blades of grass can now be seen and environmental details are no longer lost in a sea of bleary textures and jagged edges. That said, I’d be lying if I said the difference is completely transformational. Underlying assets haven’t really changed; they’re just rendered at a more appealing resolution. The visual update is nice, but I can’t say it completely bowled me over.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/WCCFzeldatotkswitch21.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>More significant is the boost in performance. On the OG Switch, you only got a shaky 30fps which could drop as low as 20fps (particularly in TotK), but on Switch 2, you’re looking at a rock-solid 60fps. Even delving into TotK’s most problematic areas, like the Fire Temple, didn’t result in any particularly noticeable hiccups, and I have to say, it felt damn good to finally wander around Kakariko Village without any chug.</p>
<p>Ultimately, though, the thing that impressed me most about the Switch 2 versions of Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom was something I wasn’t expecting – Zelda Notes. If you download the Switch 2 updates, you can now pair with a mobile app that provides the player with on-the-fly guidance and other handy features. Honestly, I’m not really a big phone guy – I own one, but I don’t do much with it, only downloading the apps I absolutely need. The idea of playing Zelda with my phone on my lap didn’t sound particularly appealing and Nintendo’s history when it comes to these kinds of mobile companion apps wasn’t terribly encouraging. Consider my surprise when I actually found the app quite useful!</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/WCCFzeldabotwswitch23.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>The core feature of Zelda Notes is an interactive map, which syncs with your Switch 2, tracks your current coordinates, and allows you to mark the location of pretty much anything you want, whether you’ve found that thing previously or not – landmarks, key items, crafting materials, enemies, whatever. The map even provides GPS-like directions to marked destinations. Of course, discovering things for yourself is part of the fun in Zelda games, but for someone like me who’s already sunk many hours into beating BotW and TotK, but still far from 100 percent completion due to a lack of time and patience for searching out every trinket, Zelda Notes is kind of a godsend.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/WCCFzeldatotkswitch22.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>For example, I’ve wanted to acquire the “Depths Armor” set in TotK for some time, as it gives you some immunity to the game’s annoying Gloom, but getting it requires the player to locate a series of difficult-to-find “Bargainer Statues” in the game’s murky underworld. I’d pretty much given up the task, but Zelda Notes allowed me to easily locate the Bargainer Statues using the map. In around 90 minutes, I finally had my Depths Armor set, something that previously would have required countless, possibly fruitless, hours of searching in-game or through poorly written online guides.</p>
<p>Zelda Notes also offers other features, including the ability to save and share Autobuild creations and items, “Voice Memories” that provide new insights about the world from Zelda and other characters, and yes, even the limited ability to fix broken weapons! Zelda Notes feels like a promising template for the future, and I’d like to see other Nintendo games, particularly those with lots of secrets, get similar guides.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/WCCFzeldabotwswitch24.jpg"></a></figure>

<h2><strong>Come for the Polish, Stay for the Pro-Tips</strong></h2>
<p>The Switch 2 versions of The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom offer a nice visual spit-shine and performance boost, although I’m not sure what you get is more impressive than some of the <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/gaming-systems/switch-2/transfer-guide/games-with-free-updates/?srsltid=AfmBOoqVmerPY3obzj00atuU_9x4IiHZhiPYF2w257wTmfUao3XQL78E" target="_blank" rel="noopener">free updates Nintendo is offering</a> for other Switch 1 games. In my opinion, what really justifies the BotW and TotK updates being paid products is Zelda Notes, which is a surprisingly useful and technically-savvy tool. Of course, not everyone will be interested in something like Zelda Notes, but if you’re looking for a bit of guidance, this is an upgrade path worth exploring, adventurer.</p>
<p>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild and The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom Nintendo Switch 2 Edition updates are available now for $10 apiece or for “free” with a Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack subscription.</p>

            <p>Some raw footage has leaked of a cinematic moment in Battlefield 6 (or Battlefield Now, or Battlefield Big War, or whatever Electronic Arts are planning to call their next western military interventionism sim). The video sees the player escaping from a collapsing dam at the last minute as bomber jets launch a payload at the big concrete waterstopper. The footage is silent, but you can insert the manly yells of "Go! Go! Go!" easily enough yourself. Perhaps more interestingly, the same leaker also provides evidence of a battle royale mode. </p>
<!--more-->
<p>The footage was <a href="https://x.com/temporyal/status/1935662844621787535">posted on social media</a> by data miner "temporyal", who has been going through the files of the Battlefield Labs playtest client, uncovering various details. It's a very early block-out of what may become a more detailed escapade during a campaign mission, or perhaps the early workings of a trailer - who knows. Either way, there's lots of greybox geometry, placeholder props, and unfinished animations. Kind of like watching theatre actors perform a rehearsal wearing their jogger bottoms, script in hand. But it does give you a sense of scale, and it's a reminder that EA remain obsessed with big chunks of world infrastructure falling on top of people.</p>
<p>It's not the only thing the leaker claims to have uncovered in their spelunk down the data mines. They've also posted <a href="https://x.com/temporyal/status/1935676264565862641">images and blurbs</a> which suggest there will be a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1kti0m0/bf_labs_datamining_the_battle_royale_mode_new/">battle royale mode</a>. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/battlefield-v">Battlefield V</a> had a battle royale mode called "Firestorm" and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/battlefield-2042">Battlefield 2042</a> had a not-quite-battle-royale mode called "Hazard Zone". I'm curious to see if they go trad royale with this one or add some sort of battlespice, if this mode does materialise.</p>
<p>There are also <a href="https://x.com/temporyal/status/1925897904956362807">lore tidbits</a> that could mean maps set in New York and Turkmenistan. As for the campaign, the miner is <a href="https://x.com/temporyal/status/1935724104931573958">convinced</a> we'll see missions taking place in various countries "including Egypt, Tajikistan, the USA, and Gibraltar". </p>
<p>But of course, all this comes deep from the guts of the game's current playtesting client. There's no guarantee such things will surface in the finished game. Bits of lore and other narrative text can be easily misinterpreted, and none of it is officially confirmed by EA, who have yet to reveal more details about the game. They are planning to show off a no doubt explodey trailer with more information sometime this summer, <a href="https://x.com/TheRealAndyMc/status/1934717781230145715">according to EA comms director Andy McNamara</a>.  

</p><p>This isn't the first leak of footage from the shooter. Following a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/battlefield-6s-crumbling-warzones-are-teased-in-a-promo-vid-calling-for-playtesters">call for playtesters</a> early this year, some nine minutes of multiplayer footage showing the series' long-running conquest mode were <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/oops-battlefield-6-features-revealed-by-leaked-battlefield-labs-footage">leaked from those playtests</a>. There are tanks and drones and medics, oh my.</p>
<p>It is looking traditionally shooty so far. Battlefield 2042, the last game of the series, was not particularly well-received among fans of bigwar, many of whom complained that it was not fully polished on release, full of bugs and instabilities. In his review, our Ed called it <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/battlefield-2042-pc-review">"an FPS that doesn't feel ready yet".</a> That'll be why EA is going so hard on playtesting this one then.</p>

<figure><a title="dk rap credits" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/ebfcd677b20e3/dk-rap-credits.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>Yes, as we reported on Wednesday, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/sounds-like-the-dk-rap-is-in-donkey-kong-bananza">the DK Rap is back</a> in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a>, which as we all know is a very good thing indeed!</p>
<p>However, one (perhaps expected, on past evidence) little wrinkle is that Grant Kirkhope, the illustrious composer of the DK Rap, alongside music for the likes of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/goldeneye_007">Goldeneye</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/banjo-kazooie">Banjo-Kazooie</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/ds/viva_pinata_pocket_paradise">Viva Pinata</a>, and a whole bunch more didn't actually know the rap was going to be used in the game.</p>
<p>As Kirkhope himself explained to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dk-rap-composer-wasnt-aware-the-worst-rap-track-in-the-history-of-rap-tracks-would-be-included-in-donkey-kong-bananza">Eurogamer</a>, he hadn't been made aware of this most recent usage, which didn't come as such a big surprise to him.</p>
<p>Describing the rap itself, which he created for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/donkey_kong_64">Donkey Kong 64</a>, as "the worst track in the history of rap tracks" (has he not seen <a href="https://youtu.be/Re4aDJL3heA?si=3AdUhICSOqi6iSC1&amp;t=150">the John Barnes rap</a>?) Kirkhope, who also wasn't credited for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/the-super-mario-bros-movie-2-release-date-cast-everything-we-know-so-far">The Super Mario Bros. Movie</a>, pointed out that's just not how Nintendo do things.</p>
<p>Speaking last month about being <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/04/grant-kirkhope-apparently-got-a-bananas-reason-for-his-missing-mario-movie-credit">left out of the movie credits</a>, he explained to Eurogamer:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"[Nintendo] said we decided that any music that was quoted from the games that we owned, we wouldn't credit the composers - apart from Koji Kondo... Then they decided anything with a vocal would get credited, so the DK Rap scores there. But then they decided if we also own it, we won't credit the composers. And that was the final nail in the coffin."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The composer tried appealing to Nintendo on other levels about being left in the movie credits, but the company won't be budged, it seems:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"I said I appreciate you've got your policies and all the rest of it, but by the time the credits roll in the movie to show the songs, the theatre's completely empty, everyone's gone, it's only me and my wife and my two kids sat there going 'look daddy's name!'. I said 'for the sake of a couple of lines of text…', but that was that."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Given that Nintendo are notorious sticklers for the rules they lay down, it's hard to see how we'll get 'Grant Kirkhope' (or <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2018/05/random_childish_gambino_sampled_donkey_kong_country_and_david_wise_definitely_approves">Dave Wise</a>, for that matter) appearing in the credits for Donkey Kong Bananza — and he's gonna have to wait and see like the rest of us, we guess — but at least he's remained humorous about the whole thing. "My tombstone will read, 'Here lies the body of Grant Kirkhope, he wrote the DK Rap and the Goldeneye Pause Music'... Nothing else will matter!!"</p>
<p>Of course, we all know Grant is quite the celebrity in the gaming realm, so we don't think he need worry about being forgotten (this writer will shout his name aloud when the rap starts in Bananza).<em><br></em></p>
<p>Now...should...should we all watch it? You only live once, right?</p>

			<p>Following Microsoft's <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-announces-multi-year-deal-with-amd-to-power-next-gen-devices/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announcement</a> of an expanded partnership with AMD to make next-generation devices, AMD CEO Lisa Su also posted her own statement <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kprpRvsOua0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in a brief video message</a>:</p>
<p><em>AMD and Microsoft are advancing a bold, shared vision for the future of gaming one that enables seamless gameplay across any screen, placing gamers at the center of the experience anywhere. We're so excited to be deepening our relationship with Microsoft and build on the over two decades of partnership, innovation, and trust. From the earliest days of the Xbox 360, to the most advanced consoles, such as the Xbox Series X and S, and the recently <a href="https://wccftech.com/rog-xbox-ally-powered-by-amd-ryzen-revealed-for-a-holiday-2025-release/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> ROG Xbox Ally handhelds.</em></p>
<p><em>Moving forward, AMD will go beyond building custom chips for Xbox consoles to designing a full roadmap of gaming optimized chips. Combining the power of Ryzen and Radeon for consoles, handhelds, PCs, and the cloud. And we're doing it all with backwards compatibility, so gamers can access their favorite titles across platforms, delivering on a promise to both gamers and developers.</em></p>
<p><em>Together, we are building a vibrant, open ecosystem that delivers the next generation of graphics and immersive gameplay, powered by AI that includes new foundational models to accelerate the state of the art in rendering. From console to cloud to handheld, AMD and Microsoft are building the future of immersive gaming. We are so excited to be working with Microsoft to bring all of this tech to gamers everywhere.</em></p>
<p>The first products born from this deeper partnership to hit the market will be the ASUS ROG Xbox Ally and ROG Xbox Ally X handhelds, which are <a target="_blank" rel="noopener">expected</a> to launch in late October, according to a recent rumor. The next-generation Xbox consoles aren't likely to be released before 2027. Interestingly, both Microsoft president Sarah Bond and AMD's Lisa Su have underlined that the new chips will also power the Xbox cloud offering, which is currently much less attractive than competitors like NVIDIA's GeForce NOW, whose servers are equipped with more powerful hardware. This should make streaming Game Pass titles way more interesting for subscribers.</p>
