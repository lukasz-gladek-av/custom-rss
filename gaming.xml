While most of these reports are very dry with technical jargon, they do indicate that Switch 2 will support near field communication, or NFC, which is how the Amiibo figures were able to connect with Nintendo's previous console to unlock new in-game content. It's also been confirmed that the radio-frequency identification (RFID) feature is located in the right Joy-Con, just as it was in the first Switch. While that's not 100% confirmation that Amiibos will continue to be utilized with the Switch 2, it certainly seems likely that they will. </p><p>The FCC filings indicate that Switch 2 will support Wi-Fi 6 (802.11ax) networks with up to 80MHz of bandwidth. That's an upgrade from the original Switch's Wi-Fi 5 capabilities, but not as fast as Wi-Fi 6E or Wi-Fi 7.

The system can be charged through either of those ports.</p><p>A previously released Japanese patent application revealed that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-patent-application-seems-to-confirm-switch-2-joy-con-feature/1100-6529310/" data-ref-id="1100-6529310">Switch 2's Joy-Cons will have mouse-like capabilities</a>.

It's not entirely clear what that means for Switch 2 yet, but hopefully more answers will be shared soon.</p>

            <p>
The battle to reboot Capcom's Resident Evil franchise for the big screen is over, and Sony has been crowned the victor. But while the ink may still be fresh on the deal, Sony's wasting no time: it's already confirmed its new Resident Evil movie hits cinemas on 18th September 2026.
</p>
<p>
Word of a Resident Evil movie reboot first surfaced back in January, with Zach Cregger - writer and director of 2022's wonderfully unpredictable Barbarian - attached to the project. At the time, four studios - including Warners Bros. and Netflix - were reportedly vying for the rights to the lucrative franchise, but Sony (as <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/03/resident-evil-zach-cregger-sony-release-date-1236313985/">relayed by Deadline</a>) has now won out.
</p>
<p>
The kerfuffle for Resident Evil is perhaps not especially surprising given previous live-action movie adaptations collectively generated a staggering $1.2bn at the box office. And Sony's interest is <em>particularly</em> not surprising, seeing as it was a major beneficiary of all that money under its previous deal to inflict Paul W. S. Anderson's Resident Evil films upon the masses.
</p>
<p>
And this isn't Sony's first attempt at a reboot either. It <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-resident-evil-movie-reboot-is-called-resident-evil-welcome-to-raccoon-city">also released 2021's underwhelming Resident Evil: Welcome to Raccoon City</a> - but while the studio's track record with the franchise isn't exactly encouraging, there's at least some reason to be optimistic. The fact Cregger is onboard to write and direct is an intriguing proposition, especially given his <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/resident-evil-movie-reboot-writer-zach-cregger-will-keep-adaptation-faithful-to-the-games">apparent keenness to keep his Resident Evil adaptation faithful to the games</a>. 
</p>
<p>
"I've been a rabid fan of these games for decades, and to be able to bring this amazing title to life is a true honor,” Cregger told Deadline following Sony's win. Constantin Film is producing and co-financing the movie, with PlayStation Productions also on board.
</p>
<p>
Will Sony's latest attempt at a reboot do justice to Capcom's esteemed - and let's be honest, utterly preposterous - survival horror series? With the next Resident Evil movie now pencilled in for a September 2026 release, we'll know soon enough.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/carmen-sandiego-review.1128729/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/carmen-sandiego-review<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Revisiting a game series from your youth is like exploring the basement in your childhood home. As you sift through the boxes and shelves, old memories come flooding back — which is exactly what happened as I started playing Carmen Sandiego, the latest game in a multimedia series that spans four decades. When the master thief appeared onscreen in her iconic trenchcoat and fedora, I was eight years old again, my face inches from a computer screen as I used my nascent knowledge of math, geography, and history to solve Carmen’s latest caper. 40 years later, Carmen Sandiego gives me that same thrill of solving puzzles by collecting clues, even if some of the modern additions to the visual novel-esque interface miss their mark.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">As a former child gumshoe whose grasp of geography was gleaned from tracking down the world’s worst criminals as they scurried around the globe, I was more than ready to revisit the Carmen Sandiego-verse with the release of this eponymous new adventure from Gameloft. Though it takes some story cues from the animated Netflix series that wrapped up in 2021 — and emulates its cartoony visual style — it’s not necessary to know anything about Carmen’s backstory with the evil organization VILE to enjoy her latest quest. Significantly, this is the first time in the long-running series that players get to step into Carmen’s shoes and don her famous fedora, but it doesn’t make a real difference to the crook-hunting formula.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While the series got its start as an edutainment game, modern Carmen Sandiego is a mix of puzzle-solving, quick-time events, a dash of third-person top-down exploration, and (of course!) the occasional trivia question. In some ways, the newer elements make the world feel bigger and more exciting than its early DOS iterations; there’s more to do than simply click on icons representing key locations, parse through dialogue, and answer questions that wouldn’t be out of place on a fifth-grade final exam. That said, I wouldn’t have missed new activities like hang-gliding and grappling from rooftop to rooftop if they weren’t included.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>In some ways, the newer elements make the world feel bigger and more exciting than its early DOS iterations.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">As you follow VILE thieves from one country to the next, you’ll need to collect two types of clues: those that help them figure out where to go next, and those that help narrow down the list of suspects in the ACME detective agency’s database. In the ’80s and ’90s, Carmen Sandiego games relied on physical almanacs full of geographical and historical facts to help answer the in-game trivia questions and figure out what their clues meant. This time around, all of that information is kept within the game itself.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Carmen Sandiego - First Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Throughout the campaign, you’ll find pieces of data like airport codes, exports, national languages, government structures, and more. This self-built almanac comes in handy when you’re on a VILE villain’s tail and need to decide what to do next. Typically, you’ll have a handful of clues to go by — a color or pattern on the flag, the spoken language, or whether residents drive on the left or right side of the road. You’ll use those clues to determine your next city from three provided choices.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Similarly, you’ll use personal information to narrow down the criminal behind each caper. The reimagined ACME Database makes this process smooth and streamlined; you can easily filter out suspects based on details about their hair and eye colors, hobbies, favorite foods, and fears. It’s quite satisfying to whittle down a list of 30-something suspects until there’s only one remaining and issue a warrant for their arrest. Just make sure you have the right person, otherwise it’s game over for Carmen (and time to start over for you).</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>It’s quite satisfying to whittle down a list of 30-something suspects until there’s only one remaining.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Clues are found by exploring key spots throughout a variety of exotic locations around the globe, from New Orleans to Barcelona to Singapore to Brisbane, with a few stops in between. This is similar to how the early games worked, but there’s a bit more room for exploration and making choices this time around. In some places, Carmen gets to wander around, question multiple witnesses, and seek out local trivia that could come in handy later. You don’t get to choose which activities happen in which location, but there’s more action involved than there used to be.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Every case has several chapters with individual heists connected by an overarching villain. The cases start out at the scene of the crime, whether that crime is the theft of a Japanese bullet train, or the replacement of a city’s free Wi-Fi hotspots with paid “Vi-Fi” versions. In each city, you can visit three locations to collect clues that bring you one step closer to solving the case.</p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="title3">Mysteries Abound!</h3><p>Games that give your brain a workout.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Here’s how it works in practice: As you visit each of the in-city landmarks and districts, such as Singapore’s Merlion statue, or a viking-themed museum in Reykjavik, you’ll need to complete pre-determined activities to uncover that location’s clues. Sometimes, that means walking around and questioning suspects and witnesses, often picking up some geographical fun facts along the way. Other times, you may have to complete a hacking or lock-picking puzzle or use Carmen’s hang glider or grappling hook.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Some of these gameplay elements are more fun than others. Completing puzzles to hack safes or boost wireless signals was satisfying, but the more physical activities are mostly on rails and not particularly thrilling. I have a particular beef with the grappling hook mini-game, which requires a simple button press as icons align on your screen. The problem is, those icons sometimes move erratically, so grappling is either way too simple or frustratingly obtuse. There’s also a hang-gliding activity that’s perfectly… fine, but I’d rather have fewer gameplay elements that are more fleshed out than some forced action that feels like filler. I would have been perfectly happy with more brain-teasers instead.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>I would have been perfectly happy with more brain-teasers.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Though not as unforgiving as the 1985 iteration, it is possible to fail cases in Carmen Sandiego. The clock is always ticking. You typically have five or seven days to solve each case, and all of your activities take time — as does flying from one city to the next. If you missed a critical clue and ended up flying to Singapore when you’re supposed to be in Buenos Aires, you just wasted 11 hours. If you run out of time, the thief gets away and you have to start the case over. However, I never really felt the time crunch in the main campaign; I typically had at least a day left over, if not several.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are other ways to fail cases in Carmen Sandiego, and these represented more of a threat in my playthrough. If you’re pickpocketing a VILE lackey and get noticed, you’ve just missed out on a key piece of evidence. Missing one clue won’t blow your case, but do that a few times and you won’t have enough information to make an arrest. Most of the time, I could pinpoint the exact moment when I blew it — I was too slow when following a mark, I didn’t pay close enough attention to actions that required precise button presses. Other times, I found myself at the end with several suspects still in my database and no idea where I missed a clue.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Though I did make some mistakes, the main campaign isn’t exactly what I’d call challenging. But considering the series’ history as a children’s educational resource, I may not be the target audience. I could see parents and kids playing through Carmen Sandiego together and having a great time as children build critical thinking skills and parents brush up on elementary-school geography. And though it’s on the simpler side, Carmen Sandiego never feels dumbed down.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For my fellow olds looking for more of a challenge, you’re in luck. Aside from the main campaign, you can explore the ACME Files for what we’re told are cold cases dating back to the ’80s. These cases have adopted the modern systems for filtering out suspects and jetting around the world, but they’re presented in a retro, pixel art style — and injected with questions that might make you feel like you’re back in school and your teacher just slapped a pop quiz on your desk. Quick, what’s the biggest island in the Caribbean? Which country was the biggest producer of wheat and rice back in 1985? What’s 4x13x80? (Thankfully, despite what my teachers told me, I do have a calculator in my pocket everywhere I go.)</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The ACME Files use a simplified interface that made me feel like I was back in front of my family computer in the early ’90s frantically paging through a physical book to find the answers. This time around, Google was my almanac. That might make the retro cases seem easier than those of the campaign, but they’re actually more difficult, particularly the time crunch. I actually did run out of time in the ACME Files, and watching those last few hours tick away filled me with a determination to do it better next time. Overall, these cases are a smart addition that add variety to the experience and provide some comforting fan service.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The historical cases pull from the same list of cities as the main campaign, and it’s only a few hours before you’ve seen everywhere in the world that Carmen Sandiego can visit. I’m not sure why they couldn’t have expanded her global reach in the main campaign, but it results in every environment feeling a bit repetitive after a while. Still, there are often new facts to find upon revisiting, so every city is always worth another look.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Maybe it’s the nostalgia goggles, but none of these shortcomings bothered me enough to make me want to stop playing. Each chapter is paced really well, so it always feels like you’re making progress. I love games that make you think your way out of problems, and for the most part, that’s exactly what Carmen Sandiego demands of the player.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s a shame, however, that the campaign ends rather abruptly. There’s another caper coming in a free DLC release later this year, but it was jarring to gear up for the final mystery and see “Coming Soon” in the menu of a completed, publicly released game. The story doesn’t feel like it’s reached a natural conclusion yet, but there’s still a good 15 hours of content between the campaign and the ACME Files — even more if you complete all of the cold cases from way back when. After my initial confusion, I took this as an opportunity to explore more old cases and await the day when I can complete Carmen’s adventure.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

The latest take on the iconic game, Monopoly App Banking, is a radical departure from prior versions. It replaces paper play money with a Play Bank card and a smartphone app.</p>

<h2>The <em>Monopoly App Banking</em> board game announcement</h2>

<p>As reported by <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/623716/hasbro-monopoly-app-banking-board-game-availability" rel="nofollow">The Verge</a>, <em>Monopoly App Banking</em> attempts to simplify gameplay by replacing the cash and banker with a free mobile app that handles all in-game transactions. Each player gets a token and a matching bank card. This card and any associated property cards, are scanned by the mobile app to automate transactions.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/monopoly-app-banking-board-artwork.jpg?itok=wtHTuvaC 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/monopoly-app-banking-board-artwork.jpg?itok=36IHePe5 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>In addition, <em>Monopoly App Banking</em> makes some changes to the original game board. Valuable properties like Park Place and Boardwalk are replaced with chocolate factories, VR rollercoasters, and dinosaur parks. Lastly, the app will contain mini-games that can be played to earn perks. According to the report, this is to help "hold the attention of younger players."</p>

<p>On paper, <em>Monopoly App Banking</em> is an attempt to bring its gameplay in line with a modern audience. The original experience is getting <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/hasbro-has-big-plans-for-monopoly-in-2025-including-new-box-and-official-expansions" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">official expansions</a> after all. However, the game is getting pushback from parents. As the New York Post highlights, parents use Monopoly as a teaching tool for their kids. The play money helps them understand basic math and fiscal responsibility..</p>

<p>Furthermore, the locations on the board being changed from conventional real estate into more fanciful properties has drawn some ire. Not only will kids not learn math or simple banking lessons, it is in service of buying not real-world investments like property but indulgent distractions like chocolate or amusement parks.</p>

<p>Lastly, there is the issue of technology being implemented into the board game. Certain board games are treated as an alternate for screen time with children. This new version of <em>Monopoly</em> not only requires it for play, it contains additional distractions with mini-games.</p>

<p><em>Monopoly App Banking</em> will be available this August at an MSRP of $24.99. The associated mobile app is free to download.</p>

            <p>
Frost Fatales - the winter version of Games Done Quick's all-women and femmes charity speedrunning event - returns this weekend for seven more days of fleet-fingered gaming feats.
</p>
<p>
More specifically, 2025's Frost Fatales kicks off this Sunday, 9th March, at 4:30pm. Expect around 30 minutes of preamble, after which - when the clock strikes 5pm - the speedruns commence with an Any% No Major Glitches run of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/cuphead">Cuphead</a> by Vicky_spleen.
</p>
<p>
Seven days and more than 60 speedruns later, this year's Frost Fatales comes to a close at 3:25am with SawaYoshi's Any% One-Handed speedrun of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/celeste">Celeste</a>. In between, you can expect a typically eclectic bedazzlement of swiftly performed entertainments, spanning everything from triple-A blockbusters and acclaimed indies to more leftfield curios.
</p>
<p>
You've got your <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/kingdom-hearts">Kingdom Hearts</a> Birth by Sleep Final Mix HD rubbing shoulders with Punch-Out!!, UFO 50's Barbuta, and Roller Coaster Tycoon 2. While the effervescent Princess Peach: Showtime makes way for the likes of Amensia: The Bunker, Clock Tower 3, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/crow-country">Crow Country</a>, Backyard Baseball '97, Hylics, and more - as <a href="https://gamesdonequick.com/schedule/55">detailed in this year's schedule</a>.
</p>
<p>
And if that sounds like the ideal way to spend the dying days of winter, speedrun fans can <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/gamesdonequick">watch Frost Fatales 2025 as it happens on Twitch</a>, starting Sunday. This year's event will be raising money for the National Women's Law Center, a US non-profit that fights for women's and LGBTQ rights through initiatives that change laws, policy, and culture.

I’d never played it. What could possible be so special?</p><p>“One of the best GB games ever,” she said when I asked. “It uses the original <em>Donkey Kong</em> (the arcade game) as a jumping-off point, like the first four stages of the game ARE the stages of the arcade game, but then instead of just looping infinitely like the arcade game does it becomes this epic puzzle platforming adventure.”</p><p>She continued, “It’s just a really neat riff on the original classic arcade game that expands it brilliantly and is actually ‘beatable’ unlike the arcade game and feels like it comes from an alternate universe of Mario platforming because he has different abilities and movement than he does in the <em>Super Mario Bros.</em> games.” Also there’s really <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://youtu.be/f_fKDQeG9Dg?si=4mUn2_EDEFsdkmBN&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://youtu.be/f_fKDQeG9Dg?si=4mUn2_EDEFsdkmBN" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cool arcade cabinet art</a></span> bordering the gameplay on the original Super Game Boy. </p><p><em>Mario’s Picross</em>, on the other hand, was the first in the Nintendo series about chipping away at nonogram logic puzzles to reveal cool pictures. It’s continued all the way to today on the Switch with the <em>Picross S</em> series, though <em>Mario’s Super Picross</em>, <em>Picross DS</em>,<em>&nbsp;</em>and<em> Picross 3D</em> remain many fans’ favorites. What’s so special about the original one besides being first? “It’s one of my favorite games ever!” contributing editor John Walker told me. “One of the solutions is a guy sat on the toilet.”</p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/aftermath-hours-podcast-monster-hunter-wilds-streamlined<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em> is absurdly popular, but depending on who you talk to, it might’ve gone a little too far in its quest to reach the widest audience possible. The latest installment in the storied series about bonking big boys until they suffer from irreversible brain trauma has trimmed so much fat that there’s nothing left but muscle and bone. Some have suggested that the series is <a href="https://www.polygon.com/review/527310/monster-hunter-wilds-review-pc-ps5-xbox" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">losing its soul</a>, or that Capcom has <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/action/why-did-monster-hunter-wilds-dedicate-so-much-effort-to-its-environments-only-to-completely-drop-the-actual-hunting-from-monster-hunter/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">removed the hunting from <em>Monster Hunter</em></a>. But on this week’s Aftermath Hours, we talk about the ways in which streamlining improves the series.</p><p>First, though, we discuss two Twitch dramas that broke containment and produced consequences that reverberated into the wider world: Several female streamers, Valkyrae, Cinna, Emiru, and Amouranth, found themselves in severe mortal peril <a href="https://aftermath.site/valkyrae-cinna-emiru-attacked-amouranth-robbed-twitch-kick" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">during the same night</a>, and Hasan “HasanAbi” Piker <a href="https://aftermath.site/hasan-piker-twitch-ban-rick-scott-medicare-medicaid" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was briefly banned</a> for suggesting that if Republican lawmakers really wanted to act on their principles, they’d “kill Rick Scott,” a current senator and former healthcare CEO who oversaw what the Department of Justice called “the largest health care fraud case in US history.” In more ways than one, how is Twitch meeting our current moment? And what are the real-world consequences of the culture surrounding the platform?&nbsp;</p><p>Then we get a Chris Person twofer in characteristically detailed breakdowns of <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em>, a game so insanely popular that it <a href="https://www.eventhubs.com/news/2025/mar/04/monster-hunter-sales-double-sf6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">nearly doubled <em>Street Fighter 6</em>’s lifetime sales in a few days</a>, and a fancy headphone convention during which he learned that the real optimal picks are <a href="https://aftermath.site/fiio-ft1-review-sennheiser-hd6xx-best-midfi-headphone-canjam" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the budget pairs you find along the way</a>. Finally, we discuss what gamers should give up for Lent (gacha games, at which point maybe they’ll just leave them behind forever, like Dry January for waifus).</p><p>You can find this week's episode below and on <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/7qtlX6MNeEoyNuHBU0chUJ?si=a2f12b75911f43cb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Spotify</a>, <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/aftermath-hours/id1727407094" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Apple</a>, or wherever else you prefer to listen to podcasts. If you like what you hear, make sure to leave a review so that we can add a legally distinct Chocobo to Aftermath that will take you to the article of your choosing without you even having to click on it.</p><p>Here’s an excerpt from our conversation:</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> I saw a lot of people espousing the idea that [<em>Monster Hunter</em>] has stripped away too much of itself – streamlined too many things – and it’s partially lost its identity. Do you feel that way, or do you think they made the correct choice in paring it down?</p><p><strong>Chris: </strong>I think they made the right move. I’m sorry. So in this one you have a legally distinct Chocobo. Basically, you can whistle and get your mount, and if you want it to, you can just press up and it’ll go to the monster. It’ll just figure it out. It’ll do full self-driving to the monster.</p><p><strong>Nathan: </strong>Even on the first try? You don’t have to find it yourself?</p><p><strong>Chris:</strong> Nope, you don’t have to do that shit. And the thing that’s cool about that – what I will say – is that you have a little grappling hook that lets you kinda <em>Pokemon Snap</em> materials from the environment. So you can aim down sight and be like “Hey, I would like that [item].” You’re just Spider-Man zapping shit to you. I gotta say: I really like doing that.&nbsp;</p><p>It streamlines stuff, and it does it in a way that allows you to actually look at the environment in ways that I think people aren’t interrogating enough. There’s a question of whether or not you’re as engaged with the world when you can let your mount autopilot, and I think that as with many things, there’s a degree to which people should interrogate the amount of friction the game gives you generally.&nbsp;</p><p>But also this game sold so fucking well.</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> Yeah, it’s a record-setting launch on Steam, right?&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Chris: </strong>I think it’s [Capcom’s] best-selling game, period.</p><p><strong>Nathan: </strong>Whoa, it nearly doubled <em>Street Fighter 6</em>’s lifetime sales in a matter of days!</p><p><strong>Chris:</strong> People want to play video games! And I mean this, because we talk about the sort of market of games, and then <em>Monster Hunter</em> comes around, and everyone’s like “Hey, this is the one we’re all playing now.” And everyone’s like “Oh, OK.”</p><p>That’s what happened with <em>Helldivers 2</em>. I think they’re actually similar, because <em>Monster Hunter</em> is kinda co-op, but it’s not a monthly fee thing. You can kind of play with your friends. It’s this ideal middle zone.</p><p>The thing about it is, I’m not precious about what <em>Monster Hunter</em> is to the same degree that other people are. I remember it on the PSP. I never got really into it on the PSP. I dipped in and out. I think that it has scaled in specific ways that are interesting. Some of the actual combat mechanics feel really nice. The hammer in this is a slower weapon that lets you give CTE to a dinosaur. It just lets you fucking give it a concussion. What’s cool about that is, over time the dinosaur starts getting shitty and slow. It will start drooling; it will clearly not be in a good way. It shouldn’t be funny to do that to a dinosaur, but it limps around because it’s clearly got a brain disorder now.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> I don’t know if I could do that.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Riley: </strong>A bit too realistic.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Chris:</strong> It’s a little sadistic! I get it. But also it feels really nice when you slam it. You know what I mean?</p><p>It’s fucking<em> Monster Hunter</em>. You know what it is. I think I like the streamlining because I’ve played so many <em>Monster Hunter</em> games, and I don’t have time for the bullshit involved in <em>Monster Hunter</em> games. The ability to be like “I’m just gonna grab that; I don’t have to get off [my mount], I don’t have to pick it up” – I kinda like that. But I’m also older, and I’m tired. [Streamlining] helps widen your base a little.</p><p><strong>Nathan: </strong>That’s a good point. <em>Monster Hunter</em> in particular is a series that’s been around for decades. And so it makes sense that they’d say “OK, we have a lot of players who are a bit older now, because they were there for the first games, and they’re still around. How do we cater to the fact that they don’t have infinite time in their days anymore to do all of the things that comprise – or used to comprise – a hunt?”&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Chris: </strong>This is sorta downwind of a lot of changes that were happening in previous games. This is not a thing that’s just suddenly out of nowhere. It’s the iterative process of “Do we really need this? Do we tweak this a little bit?” Etc. Also some people have said it’s a little too easy, but the campaign for <em>Monster Hunter</em> is a tutorial. Once you beat the campaign, that’s teaching you how to play <em>Monster Hunter</em>, and then the real game starts. It’s how MMOs work, except it’s weird when you do it with a game that’s not really an MMO. But everything that happens before the last boss is kinda pretend in some ways. It can be easy at that point, to me.</p><p><em>Wilds </em>makes the hunts more digestible, and it feels good. These games have always felt a little utilitarian to me, so I don’t have grander expectations of them. I just think the hammer feels fucking great. I think the weapons feel good. When it looks good, it looks really good, and you can see the sales figures from Mars, so who gives a shit – except people who are really, really precious about the series, and it means a lot to them?&nbsp;</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/deliver-at-all-costs-demo"><h3>Deliver At All Costs Is *CRASH* A Great *SMASH* Demo *HOUSE FALLS DOWN*</h3></a><p>Yeah yeah I'll finish the first mission, right after I *DRIVES THROUGH GAS STATION*</p></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Today, developer and publisher Tripwire Interactive announced that the next hotly-awaited title in the Killing Floor franchise will be delayed. Killing Floor 3 was initially set to release on <a href="https://wccftech.com/geforce-now-to-add-assassins-creed-shadows-split-fiction-and-killing-floor-3-in-march/">March 25</a>, but it's now been announced by Tripwire Interactive that the game will be delayed to an "undecided date" later in 2025. This <a href="https://x.com/KillingFloor/status/1898029813773836551" target="_blank" rel="noopener">update was posted</a> on the official Killing Floor 3 social media. For those who want to read it, the message is below.</p>
<p><em>Dear Killing Floor Fans,</em></p>
<p><em>We've made the decision to postpone killing Floor 3's launch to an undecided date later in 2025.</em></p>
<p><em>After taking the time to gather and discuss feedback from our recent closed beta, we've realized that we missed the mark. Our goal isn't just to make Killing Floor 3 an ambitious step forward for the franchise, but also to maintain the core experience that you've come to know and love.</em></p>
<p><em>With the full support of our parent company Embracer Group, we're working together on a timeline to address many of the common issues players had during the beta, including performance/stability, UI/UX, lighting, and weapon feel. While it's too early to say which fixes will be implemented by launch, we can confirm that an update allowing you to independently select your perk class and character is planned for post-release.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>We look forward to another opportunity to show you a more polished version of Killing Floor 3, and when we're ready to share more details, you will be the first to know. Until then, we thank you for your continued patience and overwhelming support.</em></p>
<p>In addition to this statement made, there is also an FAQ for those who have pre-ordered the game and want to know what the next step is. For those who pre-ordered and are disappointed in this news, there is <a href="https://forums.tripwireinteractive.com/index.php?threads/killing-floor-3-general-faq.2340844/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the option for a refund</a>, if you are no longer interested in receiving the game upon launch.</p>
<p>Killing Floor 3 is the latest title in the beloved co-op horror FPS series. This title takes place in the year 2091, which is a whopping 70 years after the events in Killing Floor 2, where the evil megacorp Horzine has now produced an even bigger, more dangerous army of bio-engineered monstrosities that are called Zeds. In this game, you take up the role of a Nightfall specialist, a rebel rogue group that is tasked with destroying the Zeds. You'll get to unlock skills, try out new weapons, and team up with up to five teammates to battle it out for survival.</p>
<p>Killing Floor 3 is set to release on PC via Steam and Epic Games Store, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S later this year.</p>

            <p>
If you've been keeping up with Battlefield, you'll be aware of EA's plans to hold invite-only playtests for the series' next instalment as it seeks to avoid the kind of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-admits-battlefield-2042-flopped-but-would-have-been-less-than-10-percent-of-annual-revenue-anyway">disastrous response Battlefield 2042 received</a>. And with the first of these now underway, it's perhaps not a huge surprise to learn players are already ignoring their NDAs and leaking early gameplay online.
</p>
<p>
Pretty much all we know about the next Battlefield so far is that it's set in the modern day, and will <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-says-next-battlefield-is-modern-day-brings-back-classes-and-more-focused-maps">bring back traditional classes and more focused maps</a> after the unpopular changes made in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/battlefield-2042">Battlefield 2042</a>. Beyond that, it's all speculation - although one sleuth scoured the new game's concept art and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-sleuth-seemingly-identifies-location-teased-in-next-games-first-bit-of-concept-art">identified landmarks suggesting it could be set in Gibraltar</a>.
</p>
<p>
There's so much still being kept under wraps, in fact, that it's perhaps a surprise EA is willing to start playtests before anything close to a big reveal. But here we are, with the first phase of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/next-battlefield-game-glimpsed-as-ea-announces-big-community-playtest-plans">its Battlefield Labs initiative</a> - described as the "most ambitious community testing program in franchise history" - now live. And despite participants needing to sign an NDA before they can get involved, gameplay is already <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1j5sf4u/new_battlefield_leaked_gameplay/">popping</a> up in <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1j5sf4u/new_battlefield_leaked_gameplay/">various</a> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1j5tvrg/battlefield_6_gameplay_leak_11_minutes/">corners</a> of the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1j5t4bv/battlefield_6_gameplay_leaks_2_minutes_online/">internet</a>.

<p>
Inevitably, EA is now embroiled in a game of whack-a-mole as far as the leaked gameplay is concerned, but plenty still lingers. Most of the footage surfaced so far consists of multiplayer sessions in Conquest mode, all playing out across the narrow, criss-crossing streets of what appears to be a North African city, and featuring plenty of environmental destruction.
</p>
<p>
Conquest mode is just one aspect of the new Battlefield game EA previously said it would be testing as its Labs initiative continues - with the publisher also confirming sessions will include a chance to playtest Breakthrough mode, the game's more traditional class system, and "new ideas". And with more tests to come, it's almost inevitable more leaks will follow - which might not be such a bad thing for EA after Battlefield 2042, given the gameplay currently doing the rounds seems to be garnering a tentatively positive response.
</p>
<p>
In its <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1j5jbil/battlefield_labs_community_update_gunplay_and/">latest community update</a>, EA wrote, "Within Battlefield Labs, we're focused on refining the best elements from past titles, modernizing them, and validating if they feel fun and rewarding, and have the right balance between intuitive control and dynamic combat... Our goal is to offer gameplay that rewards skill with precise weapon feedback and movement options for veterans, while providing an intuitive experience for new players to learn and enjoy."
</p>
<p>
As to when the next Battlefield will get its full reveal, that's currently unclear - although last month, EA confirmed it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-says-next-battlefield-expected-to-release-before-april-2026">expects the series' latest instalment to arrive before April next year</a>.
