<p>And you can upgrade from Switch 1, too</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>At last, <a href="https://x.com/sonic_hedgehog/status/1986478837384028422">Sega has confirmed</a> that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/sonic-racing-crossworlds-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition</a> launches on <strong>4th December 2025</strong> for <strong>$69.99</strong>, right in time for the holidays (via <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2025/11/sonic-racing-crossworlds-nintendo-switch-2-edition-launches-december-4">Gematsu</a>).</p>
<p>Note that a physical release, where the game is fully on the cart, will be following in early 2026.</p>
<p>Those of you who have already bought the game on Switch 1, you'll be able to purchase an upgrade pack for <strong>$10</strong> (or your regional equivalent) — <em>plus</em> if you grab that pack before 10th December, you'll get a 50% discount. $5 it is, then.</p>
<p>Those of you who'll be grabbing the game on Switch 2 before 17th December will also get the Werehog Pack DLC as a free bonus.</p>
<p>Originally launching on the Switch back in September, Sonic Racing CrossWorld has already sold over 1 million units and has been receiving frequent guest character updates. Just today, Like A Dragon's own <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/reminder-sonic-racing-crossworlds-gets-another-free-guest-character-today">Ichiban Kasuga has joined the roster</a>.</p>
<p>Our <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch/sonic-racing-crossworlds">review of the Switch 1 version</a>, penned by our very own Mitch Vogel, was full of praise for the karting and racing, but said the performance on the older console was "disappointing". The Switch 2 version <em>should</em> fix those issues, then...</p>
<p>And hey, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/opinion-sonic-racing-crossworlds-mario-kart-world-and-its-not-even-close-for-me">someone here at Nintendo Life</a> think it's better than <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a>. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/kirby-air-riders">Kirby</a>, watch out, the hedgehog is back.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Research and analysis firm <a href="https://alineaanalytics.substack.com/p/arc-raiders-has-sold-25m-copies">Alinea Analytics reports</a> that ARC Raiders, the new third-person extraction shooter from Embark Studios, has reached 2.5 million copies sold across all platforms in its debut week, with the vast majority of those sales coming from PC players.</p>



<p>According to Alinea Analytics, across PlayStation, Xbox, and PC, 69% of ARC Raiders sales came from PC players on Steam, with 17.3% coming from PlayStation players and the remaining 13% coming from Xbox players.</p>



<figure><figcaption><em>Image credit: Alinea Analytics</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>It was already clear that ARC Raiders was having a strong commercial start <a href="https://wccftech.com/arc-raiders-surpasses-200k-concurrent-players-on-steam-at-launch/">when it surpassed 200K concurrent players on Steam on its launch day</a> (and eventually hit over 260K). As its debut week came to a close, <a href="https://wccftech.com/arc-raiders-sales-estimates-range-1-6-1-9-million-units-on-steam/">analysts predicted it had sold somewhere between 1.6 and 1.9 million copies</a>.</p>



<p>The real number is, thankfully for Embark Studios, even higher than those predictions, as the studio also collects well over $100 million in revenue from the game being on the market for one week. It's handily a bigger launch than Embark Studio's other major multiplayer game, The Finals, and could very well outlast it partly because of its different approach as a premium release and not a free-to-play title.</p>



<p>Of course, the new extraction shooter still has a long way to go. It passed the first hurdle for a multiplayer game by having a great launch, and now the real test becomes its capacity for longevity. Right now, ARC Raiders has <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1808500/charts/#1w">yet to fall below 90K concurrent players on Steam</a>, and even its dip below 100K was only for a very short period of time.</p>



<p>If we're still seeing numbers like that from ARC Raiders in a year, then we'll have a much better sample size for how successful this game can really be. Speaking of what's to come for ARC Raiders, Embark Studios has already <a href="https://wccftech.com/embark-studios-arc-raiders-2025-roadmap/">put out a roadmap for the game's updates for the rest of the year, which you can check out here</a>.</p>

The U.S. forces will have access to the Italian Partisans, a resistance group that aids their efforts behind enemy lines through sabotage, hidden tunnels, and fighters who will go into battle alongside your troops.</p><p>Germany's Wehrmacht will receive a Last Stand battlegroup that exists to slow down the Allied advance with imposing new vehicles including the Borgward Wanze and Pantherturm. The Last Stand group can also demoralize their enemy through propaganda towers, Panzerfaust rollouts, and improvised barrages.</p><p>British forces will be given backup from the Polish cavalry battlegroup, which thrives against veteran soldiers with a deep desire for revenge against the Nazis. The cavalry is equipped with heavy weaponry, Polish-crewed Sherman Fireflies, and Land Mattresses.</p><p>Deutsches Afrikakorps--aka Germany's Africa expedition force--is getting support from the German navy, the Kriegsmarine. This battlegroup can fortify positions with "catastrophic fire support" while opening up supply chains for troops. The Kriegsmarine can provide supply drops, engineering know-how, and "combat flexibility."</p><p>Company of Heroes 3 Battlegroup DLC - Endure &amp; Defy will drop November 27 on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1677280/Company_of_Heroes_3/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Steam</a>. It's regular price is $25, but it will be offered at 10% off that price for the first two weeks. During that time, new players can also purchase the core Company of Heroes 3 game for 60% off its normal $60 price.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[How The US Patent And Trademark Office Will Reexamine Nintendo’s Battling Patent]]></title>
            <link>https://aftermath.site/uspto-pokemon-patent-reexamination</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/how-the-us-patent-and-trademark-office-will-reexamine-nintendo%E2%80%99s-battling-patent.1345993/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>As Nintendo fights <em>Palworld</em> creator Pocketpair in Japanese court over patent infringement, the United States Patent and Trademark Office is taking the unprecedented step of reexamining one of Nintendo's already approved American patents. The patent being reexamined by the USPTO is entirely separate from the ones being scrutinized in Japanese courts. But that case—and the controversial nature of its broad patent—has thrust Nintendo's patent strategy into the spotlight.</p><p>The USPTO will reexamine <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/what-does-nintendo-s-new-pok-mon-patent-actually-mean-for-game-developers-" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a Pokémon patent</a> covering a summoning and autobattling system that was approved by the government body in September. <a href="https://gamesfray.com/huge-blow-for-nintendo-head-of-u-s-patent-office-takes-rare-step-to-order-reexamination-of-summon-subcharacter-and-let-it-fight-in-1-of-2-modes-patent/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">USPTO director John Squires filed</a> for an <a href="https://www.mbhb.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Reexam_Order.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ex parte<em> </em>reexamination</a> himself, and, naturally, it was granted, putting the patentability of the mechanics into question. Specifically, Squires ordered the reexamination because the office was made aware of <em>other</em> patents that would be considered prior art—any previously created inventions or materials crucial to examining patent validity—that weren't brought up during the original process of its patent examination. (Nintendo provided a link only to its website as prior art references in its original application.)</p><p>Nintendo's September patent covers a battling system that sounds like the ones in <em>Pokémon Scarlet </em>and <em>Pokémon Violent</em>, in which a player releases a Pokémon from its Poké Ball and it fights another Pokémon if there's one within a certain range. If not, the player can point the Pokémon in a different direction, and the Pokémon can head that way. If there's an enemy Pokémon around, they'll fight. The approval of the patent made headlines, with game developers, lawyers, and players questioning whether Nintendo and The Pokémon Company should be able to patent the process behind a relatively simple sequence of events. The companies' ongoing legal trademark battle with <em>Palworld</em> only added fuel to that fire.</p><p>The reevaluation of a patent doesn't happen very often. When a patent is approved, it's approved, and it often takes a third-party complaint or a lawsuit to make a challenge there. Roughly 15,000 requests for ex parte examinations have been made since the process was implemented in 1981, McDonnell Boehnen Hulbert &amp; Berghoff partner and patent attorney <a href="https://www.mbhb.com/intelligence/snippets/uspto-director-scrutinizes-potentially-susceptible-pokemon-patent/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Andrew Velzen</a> told Aftermath. Of those requests, just 175 of the reexaminations filed were made by the USPTO director. Typically, it's patent owners themselves or third-parties who file these sorts of requests.</p><p>"It wouldn't be shocking if [<em>Palworld</em> developer] Pocketpair had filed a request on Nintendo's patent, but that's not what happened here," Velzen said. "It was the patent office itself doing it, and that has only happened, based on the statistics I dug up, 175 times ever between 1981 and 2024."</p><p>The USPTO will take a second look at the Nintendo patent against two other patents (one from Nintendo, another from Konami) to determine what happens to the patent. Squires said the two patents are "important in deciding whether the claims are patentable, and [...] each raises a substantial new question of patentability."</p><p>Haley MacLean, a Canadian lawyer with Voyer Law who specializes in intellectual property law, told Aftermath that it's a good thing that this patent is getting reexamined. She said she'd been feeling "hopeless" about the state of patent law in the video game industry; broad software patents often muddy the lines between what's actually a patentable idea and what's just an idea. Nintendo's September, for many, sounded a lot like an idea that was dressed up by technical language and not necessarily something entirely new. The prior art referenced on patent applications becomes especially important in these applications, because it's something for the patent examiner to reference while making a decision.</p><p>MacLean said the patent examiner will be looking at Nintendo's battling patent—against the Nintendo and Konami patents—in two ways: novelty and obviousness. Is Nintendo's September patent different enough from the two prior art references? The Nintendo patent being used as prior art in this reexamination was <a href="https://patents.google.com/patent/US20200254335A1/en?oq=2020%2f0254335" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">published in 2020 and outlines a method of controlling both a player character</a> and a sub-character (i.e., a Pokémon trainer and a Pokémon), in which the sub-character is automatically controlled, except when the player hits the ZL button to attack. (This sounds like it may be related to the way battling works in <em>Pokémon Legends: Arceus</em> and the new <em>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</em>, where the ZL button locks onto targets.) The Konami patent, <a href="https://patents.google.com/patent/US6743099B2/en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">published in 2002 and now expired</a>, also details a system wherein a player and a sub-character battle automatically or manually.&nbsp;</p><p>The second piece the examiner will look at, MacLean said, is obviousness. "Something can't be obvious to somebody called the <em>posita</em>, or person of ordinary skill in the art," she said. "You take the prior art and what it's protecting and compare it to what Nintendo's trying to protect."&nbsp; They're looking to decide if, say, a game developer would see the Nintendo September patent as an obvious extension of the prior art. In other words, would it be easy for a game developer to make the leap from Nintendo's 2020 system, in which sub-characters both move automatically and manually in battles, and with a specific button to lock onto enemies, to the most recent system from its September patent in which the player can point a sub-character in a different direction to <em>find</em> an enemy.</p><p>"This is the first time [the USPTO direction initiating a reexamination] has happened in quite some time, and certainly the first I'm aware of in the video game space," Velzen said.</p><p>Both MacLean and Velzen said that the original application didn't have as thorough of an examination as what's typical; the patent just went straight through without any hiccups, which is uncommon. Velzen said that it's common for a patent to get rejected at least once first, then for the patent applicant to revise it.&nbsp;</p><p>Then, there's <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/gaming-industry/japanese-patent-officials-reject-one-of-nintendos-pokemon-patent-applications-for-being-too-similar-to-ark-monster-hunter-and-embarrasingly-pokemon-go/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the news that the Japanese patent office recently rejected a Nintendo patent</a>. The Japanese body rejected a pending application covering aiming and throwing items (i.e., Poké Balls) to capture creatures. The patent is not part of the ongoing <em>Palworld</em> lawsuit, in which Nintendo and The Pokémon Company are suing Pocketpair for patent violations, but is an offshoot of one patent part of the suit.&nbsp;</p><p>That lawsuit itself—and the press around it—could also be part of the wider eyes on Nintendo's patents, even by the USPTO, despite Nintendo's September patent being unrelated. And public response to Nintendo's September patent may have played a part in getting the reexamination in front of the USPTO director.</p><p>"The public is interested," MacLean said. "I think all that probably accumulated to [the USPTO director] saying, <em>OK, we need to look at this again</em>."</p><p>It's ultimately a good thing for the video game industry, MacLean said. "This is a disruption of the normal status quo, and the current trend of video game mechanic patents getting auto approved—immediately approved, rapidly and excessively."</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/manual-ear-and-nosehair-trimmer"><h3>Nothing But Respect For This Manual Ear And Nose Hair Trimmer</h3></a><p>The Golden Birdie by South Korean brand Royal is a simple piece of metal that is leagues better than its flimsy, electric counterparts.</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/dispatch-telltale-games-adhoc-studio"><h3>Dispatch Brings Back The Halcyon  Era Of Online Water Cooler Talk</h3></a><p>Adhoc Studio’s superhero choose-your-own-adventure feels like a fun hole-in-the-wall, word-of-mouth-recommended spot that the gaming communities haven’t had in a minute</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/kodansha-studios-akira-anime-live-ation-chloe-zhao-nicolas-gonda"><h3>Somehow, The Threat Of A Live-Action Akira Refuses To Die</h3></a><p>If there is any anime that could be considered Hollywood’s Moby Dick, it is Akira</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/i-owe-my-workday-to-criterion-24-7"><h3>I Owe My Workday To Criterion 24/7</h3></a><p>If you’re going to have cotton candy, you have to eat your vegetables too.</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div><br/><br/>https://aftermath.site/uspto-pokemon-patent-reexamination]]></content:encoded>

            <title><![CDATA[Hitman: Absolution Shoots Onto Switch 1 Next Week]]></title>
            <link>https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/hitman-absolution-shoots-onto-switch-1-next-week</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/hitman-absolution-shoots-onto-switch-1-next-week.1345975/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>

<p>We last caught wind of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hitman-absolution">Hitman: Absolution</a> back in July, when developer Feral Interactive announced that it was bringing its latest remake to Switch at some point in 2025, with a Switch 2 edition to follow. Things have remained quiet on the Switch 2 front, but today, we've had news of the Switch 1 version, and it's arriving <em>next week</em>.</p>
<p>Yep, you read that correctly. Hitman: Absolution will land on Switch 1 on <strong>13th November</strong> for <strong>£19.99 / $29.99 / €24,99</strong>. The new trailer (above) showcases the 2012 stealth game in action on Nintendo's hybrid, and it looks, well, much as we remember it. But hey, more Hitman is never a bad thing!</p>
<p>Like Feral's recent mobile release, Absolution on Switch will be getting a 'Contracts Mode' update next year, where you'll be able to set challenges against friends and compete for high scores.</p>
<p>Here's a rundown of the game's key features and a handful of screens from Feral Interactive:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>MORE THAN A NUMBER<br></strong>The story of Absolution puts Agent 47’s character under the spotlight, where his loyalties and his conscience are both put to the test.<br>
<strong>TAILORED TO NINTENDO SWITCH<br></strong>Featuring gyro aiming for ultimate precision, Absolution is fully optimised for Nintendo Switch and tailored for play at home or on the go.<br>
<strong>KILLER INSTINCT<br></strong>Use Instinct Mode to identify targets, predict enemy movements, and highlight points of interest.<br>
<strong>CLEAR YOUR PATH<br></strong>Point Shooting lets you stop time, mark multiple enemies, and eliminate them in a heartbeat.<br>
<strong>MASTER THE CRAFT<br></strong>Find new ways to take out your marks, complete Challenges, and perfect your technique.<br>
<strong>PLAY IT AGAIN AND AGAIN<br></strong>Choose from 5 different difficulty settings, from easy to the insanely hard Purist mode.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>"But what about the Switch 2 version?" you may, rightfully, ask. Well, we still don't know yet. Feral stated on <a href="https://x.com/feralgames/status/1986459928525938858">Twitter</a> that it will "have more to say about the Switch 2 next year," and fans should "keep an eye out for further announcements". So, we guess we'll do exactly that!</p>
<p>As a reminder, IO Interactive brought Hitman World of Assassination to Switch 2 earlier this year, though a wealth of performance issues meant that it wasn't in the best state at launch. A subsequent patch helped things move in the right direction, but let's hope that Feral Interactive can make Absolution stronger out of the gate.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-gen-ai-square-enix-qa-bugs-2000641688</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Square Enix is currently in the middle of a reboot. Following a bunch of flops (<a href="https://kotaku.com/foamstars-review-splatoon-ps5-is-it-good-square-enix-1851239389">remember<em> Foamstars</em></a>?) and some great games held back by timed exclusivity (<em>Final Fantasy XVI</em>, <em>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</em>), the RPG publisher has been pivoting to a <a href="https://kotaku.com/square-enix-business-plan-multiplatform-1851472456">multiplatform approach and retooling its slate of upcoming releases</a>. It’s also, apparently, making a big push into leveraging generative AI. The company announced a new goal of having 70 percent of quality assurance and game debugging work handled by generative AI by 2027.</p> <p>“Through the use of automation technology, [we] aim to improve the efficiency of QA operations and establish a competitive advantage in game development,” reads <a href="https://www.hd.square-enix.com/eng/ir/pdf/20251106_01_en.pdf">a new presentation</a> updating investors on Square Enix’s business strategy (via <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/square-enix-says-it-wants-generative-ai-to-be-doing-70-of-its-qa-and-debugging-by-the-end-of-2027/"><em>VGC</em></a>). The project developed out of an AI-themed “idea contest” the company held, and will be part of a joint research initiative with Matsuo Laboratory at the University of Tokyo. Is this a real plan or just a way to impress investors with buzzwords?</p>

 <p>Square Enix isn’t the only company trying to apply generative AI tools to QA. While some companies <a href="https://kotaku.com/black-ops-7-generative-ai-call-duty-gamescom-2025-slop-2000618833">get lampooned</a> for letting AI slop infest concept art or even finished loading screens that appear in the game, <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-microsoft-matt-booty-qa-crunch-ai-mistreatment-1849496926">others have argued</a> that the job of discovering and documenting bugs is one where LLM technology will be most useful. An AI data firm <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/report-30-of-game-devs-believe-ai-will-play-an-extremely-important-role-in-qa-testing">claimed earlier this year</a> that 30 percent of respondents to a developer survey believed AI would play an “extremely important role” in QA testing.</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">I'm convinced that statement from Square is to just get shareholders excited, because what is GenAi really gonna say when something like this pops up? Can it even critically understand what it's looking at to report the issue accurately? <a href="https://t.co/VJ5r67Fu27">pic.twitter.com/VJ5r67Fu27</a></p> <p>— Del (@TheCartelDel) <a href="https://twitter.com/TheCartelDel/status/1986413587561390345?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 6, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>But will it actually be any good or save studios time and money? Veteran game artist Del Walker pointed out a recent bug in <em>Marvel Rivals</em> by which a costume completely breaks a character’s model during certain animations. “What is GenAi really gonna say when something like this pops up?” he wrote <a href="https://x.com/TheCartelDel/status/1986413587561390345">on X</a>. “Can it even critically understand what it’s looking at to report the issue accurately?”</p>

 <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/activision-blizzard-s-qa-department-seems-like-a-hellho-1847473158">Quality assurance</a> has long been at the bottom of the hierarchy when it comes to game development prestige and pay, despite bugs and glitches being the first things to go viral during a game launch, setting the tone of how big-budget games are perceived. They can also make or break its initial reception if things are particularly bad. <em>Fallout 76</em> was particularly bad when it first released and was infamous early on for important updates that found new ways to accidentally break the game.</p> <p>QA, in other words, is very important, but it can also be very labor intensive. If we know one thing about companies its that they love results and hate having to pay people to produce them. It’s easy to envision a way forward where developers on the studio floor are able to experiment with new tools and see whether they work before committing to ambitious goals that replace expertise with automation. That probably doesn’t sound as good in a PowerPoint presentation, though.</p>

<p>Sony San Diego has, as expected, officially announced MLB The Show 26. While no platforms or release date were confirmed, the studio did give players, what it calls, a “sneak peek” for what to expect from the latest installment in the franchise. </p>



<p>Specifically, Sony San Diego touched on gameplay, Franchise Mode, Road to the Show, Diamond Dynasty, and the season four of The Negro Leagues storylines.</p>



<h2 id="h-mlb-the-show-26-first-details">MLB The Show 26 First Details</h2>



<p>Regarding gameplay, <a href="https://theshow.com/news/mlb-the-show-26-first-news/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the studio says that</a> the goal remains “delivering the most authentic on-field baseball experience.” They say that this year will focus on “advanced logic and new data metrics” along with redefined player ratings, bat ball physics, and pitch effects. </p>



<p>For Franchise Mode, MLB The Show 26 will “continue evolving the front office experience by building deeper, more immersive, and challenging systems shaped by community feedback.” Road to the Show builds off the changes started in MLB The Show 25 with more colleges to choose from and a larger focus on a player’s mid-to-late career.</p>



<p>Within Diamond Dynasty, Sony wants to deliver “engaging content for players to live their MLB fantasy as well as new ways to play and use your squads.” </p>



<p>And, lastly, The Negro Leagues Storylines will include more moments that defined the careers of players that were “talented yet often overlooked”.</p>



<p>More specifics, Sony San Diego says, will start to come in early 2026. That will include details such as platforms, the release date, cover athletes, and more. </p>

                <p>Ubisoft's Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora is getting a new expansion, From the Ashes, later this year to coincide with the release of James Cameron's Avatar: Fire and Ash in theaters. Ubisoft has now shared some more information about the expansion, including its length.</p><p>Ubisoft <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/game/avatar/frontiers-of-pandora/news-updates/12Y5efVFVWZwiblGQCIR1C" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">says</a> From the Ashes is estimated to include "roughly" 20 hours of content. However, how long it may take you to spend completing the content will depend on your preferred playstyle. "The overall length will vary," Ubisoft said.</p><p>Players have to own Frontiers of Pandora to play From the Ashes, but the expansion's content is accessible right from the main menu. There are no completion requirements to get started.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JXBW2alPp50" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/JXBW2alPp50" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Since Frontiers of Pandora originally came out back in 2023, some people might want to be reminded of the story before playing From the Ashes. To that end, Ubisoft created a "short recap video" that people can watch to get up to speed.</p><p>The $25 expansion launches on December 19, which is the same day the movie Fire and Ash hits theaters. Players need a copy of the base game to play, or they can buy the $40 Frontiers of Pandora - From the Ashes Edition, which includes the base game and the DLC.</p><p>Ubisoft is also selling a Complete Edition of the game for $60, and it includes the main game, the From the Ashes expansion, and the Season Pass.</p><p>In From the Ashes, you play as So'lek, and the story is about grief and vengeance, Ubisoft said. A free update coming to Frontiers of Pandora on December 5 will add a third-person mode, but the From the Ashes content can be played in either first- or third-person.</p><p>Ubisoft will broadcast a deep dive for From the Ashes on November 20, so check back soon for more.</p>

<figure data-uuid="7751340a518eb"><a title="A Link to the Past" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/7751340a518eb/a-link-to-the-past.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>Analytics firm <a href="https://www.ampereanalysis.com/">Ampere Analysis</a> has posted a list of games it believes would greatly benefit from a remake or remaster (thanks, <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/ip-holders-are-sitting-on-a-wealth-of-content-analytics-firm-lists-18-games-ripe-for-remake-or-remaster-success/">VGC</a>). This is supposedly based on analysis of the market and consumer behaviours and attitudes – otherwise, we could just as easily pluck a bunch of games from thin air that we think need remakes!</p>
<p>What caught our eye straight away was <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/legend_of_zelda_a_link_to_the_past">The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/chrono_trigger">Chrono Trigger</a>, both of which are, according to Ampere, prime candidates for full remakes. Now, we'd be happy to make a case for Chrono Trigger; especially if Square Enix wants to opt for the HD-2D style it's been evolving in recent years. A Link to the Past, though? Hmm, we're not sure about that.</p>
<p>The thing is with top-down Zelda games is that, in our opinion, they kind of need to <em>stay</em> top-down. And considering the game has already received a sequel in the form of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/3ds/legend_of_zelda_a_link_between_worlds">A Link Between Worlds</a>, we're not entirely convinced it really needs a remake.</p>
<p>Ampere writer Katie Holt says that while long-time fans consider it a high point in the series, “its dungeon and world design can be considered outdated, and the narrative is relatively linear by today’s standards”. In addition, searching for “The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past remake” on Reddit returns an astonishing 48,200 results, and Nintendo would supposedly be wise to approach it in a similar way to the Switch remake of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/legend_of_zelda_links_awakening">Link's Awakening</a>.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, Ampere believes that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/3ds/legend_of_zelda_ocarina_of_time_3d">Zelda: Ocarina of Time 3D</a> would benefit from a remake or a remaster – they're supposedly not fussed which. And yeah, we could get on board with this. With the 40th anniversary looming, we wouldn't be surprised to see Nintendo revisit what is arguably one of the most influential 3D adventure games of all time.</p>
<p>Here's the list of games from Ampere Analysis:</p>
<h3>Remake</h3>
<ul>
<li>Assassin’s Creed</li>
<li>Chrono Trigger</li>
<li>The Legend of Zelda: A Link to the Past</li>
<li>Fallout</li>
<li>Rayman Origins</li>
<li>Resident Evil 5</li>
<li>Uncharted: Drake’s Fortune</li>
</ul>

<li>Bloodborne</li>
<li>Bully</li>
<li>Dragon Age Origins</li>
<li>The Elder Scrolls: Morrowind</li>
<li>Fallout: New Vegas</li>
<li>Red Dead Redemption 2</li>

<p>In a new video shared on YouTube, <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://www.youtube.com/@FullyBuffered">Fully Buffered</a> attempted to run the latest entry in the series by EA on two old CPUs, the Intel Core i7-2600K and the aforementioned AMD FX-9590. While the game wouldn't launch on the Intel CPU due to the lack of Secure Boot support, the AMD CPU could launch and run the game, having Secure Boot support. As such, it seems like not supporting TPM 2.0 doesn't prevent a CPU from running the game, as lacking SecureBoot support does.</p>



<p>Although the AMD FX-9590 is an old CPU released over 10 years ago, it runs Battlefield 6 surprisingly well, paired with an RX 5700 8 GB GPU. In Conquest mode with a total of 64 players, the game runs at a mid-30s FPS range, occasionally reaching the 40s range at 1080p resolution, which is very impressive for an older CPU. In other game modes, and by lowering the resolution, the game even hits the mid-40s range. Unsurprisingly, all of the CPU's core are pushed to their limit to run the game, hitting 98% utilization at 4,65 GHz.</p>

<p>An old CPU, such as the AMD FX-9590, running Battlefield 6 as well as it does, confirms the greater attention the development team put into optimizing the game and ensuring it could run well even on low-spec systems. Before the game launched, technical director Christian Buhl confirmed that <span>among the millions of players who joined the Battlefield 6 open beta,&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-effort-minimum-specs/" target="_blank">a substantial number were on minimum specs or below.</a>&nbsp;Therefore, it was essential</span> for the team to optimize for these low specs to ensure all players could enjoy the game. Overcoming the technical limitations of the Xbox Series S also made <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-series-s-limitations-battlefield-6-better-game/">Battlefield 6 a better game from a technical standpoint.</a></p>



<p>Battlefield 6 is now available on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S. You can learn more about the game by checking out <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/battlefield-6-battlefield-is-mostly-back/">David Carcasole's review.</a></p>

            <p>With a final lick, the weasel expires. Its head is mine. I slink back to my nest and shove this new head onto my strangely thick duck neck. Then, I take off in a flutter and scutter of beetle wings and legs. I pass an Oscar the grouch-style bloke in a basket selling animal body parts for crystals. Ahead lies a giant salamander wearing a fedora. He asks me to go and steal some eggs from an ant queen who's wearing an actual crown. I refuse. We fight. He keeps whistling for backup. My weasel head bites away, an openly terrified expression written across its whiskers.</p>
<p>That, in so many words, is <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2463690/Strange_Seed/">Strange Seed</a>, which came out in full yesterday and also has a demo I've gioven a go for this article. It's a cartoonish evolution murderfest from devs Chronicle Games, who cite E.V.O.: Search for Eden and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/spore">Spore</a>’s creature stage as their inspirations.</p>

<p>I'm quite young, and so haven't gotten around to playing either of those games. I've still found Strange Seed charmingly weird and weirdly charming. Well, at least when I'm managing not to think about what its central loop entails too much. You begin as a purple blob which drops off a tree, and quite jovially sets about replacing its blob body parts with those of creatures inhabiting the forest.</p><p>You murder these creatures and other blobs by licking, biting, or charging them, and they turn into a hunk of meat on a bone. You gobble this up for health, biomass which'll allow you to equip more animal parts, and animal parts themselves. Some can be talked to. For example, early on you meet a lonely duck. He'll only let you be his friend if you've got a duck's long neck. You murder another duck, take the neck from its hunk of death meat, and voilà, he's your mate. For five seconds, after which point you murder him for more duck parts.</p>
<p>To equip new parts, you claim nests, which I'm probably going to risk pissing people off by likening to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-boss-locations">Elden Ring</a>'s sites of grace. They're spots of brief respite that act as respawn points throughout the world and also allow you to switch up your animal part loadout. What you equip is limited by what you've found, but also how many bits of biomass murders and exploration have earned, with some animal parts being more effective, but taking up more of your biomass limit while they're active.</p>
<p>You also find powerups while exploring which allow you to upgrade the mass of a body part. These all offer different stat boots, and the health one's linked to your neck. So, if you're minded similarly to me, odds are your head'll end up mounted on a tree trunk. Though, that might just be because I'm a bit crap at timing my licks and charges to quickly take out fairly tough beetles. I've found one boss so far - the salamander who speaks like a cockney gangster that I mentioned earlier. It's going to take a fair bit more murder-grinding before I can beat him.</p>
<p>I may well end up doing it though. Despite the constant freakish body horror, Strange Seed's got a chuckle-worthy charisma that hasn't quite worn off on me yet and is janky in the right ways rather than annoying performance ones thus far. You can check out the demo on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3224660/Strange_Seed_Demo/">Steam</a> if it sounds up your alley.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Hello and welcome back to Morning Checkpoint, <em>Kotaku’s</em> daily round-up of interesting news and other stuff you might care about. It’s weird to me that<a href="https://kotaku.com/gremlins-3-announced-2027-speilberg-call-of-duty-sequel-chris-columbus-2000641675"> WB is making a <em>Gremlins 3</em></a>, but hey, if it features a lot of gross puppets bouncing around like cartoon maniacs, I’ll be there day one to enjoy it. Anyway, today we have news about a <em>Roblox</em> movie, <em>Overcooked</em> is becoming a reality show, and the story of an NBA player who kicked ass to spite a kid he met in a video game.</p> <h2><strong>NBA player was heckled in <em>NBA 2K26</em> and then scored 46 points as revenge</strong></h2> <p>On Wednesday night, Cleveland Cavaliers guard Donovan Mitchell had a great game against the Philadelphia 76ers, scoring 46 points and eight assists to help the Cavs grab a victory. When asked afterward about his performance, Mitchell revealed that he played so well because he was taunted by someone, possibly a kid, while playing<em> NBA 2K26</em>. <a href="https://x.com/CultureCrave/status/1986382376843551086">Here’s what he said</a>, according to CBS Sports:</p>

 <blockquote><p>You have moments where it’s like–obviously, you play this game and you’re trying to win–but this was just a cool day as a whole for me. And obviously, to have the night I had was definitely special as well. But I wouldn’t put the game I had based on the court.</p> <p>This kid pissed me off today, I was playing <em>2K.</em> I had been playing <em>2K</em> for like two hours, and I told him, too, I said ‘Just wait.’ He called me ‘Washed up,’ he called me a bunch of things. But I love it. He said he hadn’t seen a highlight from me in a minute. I just told him, ‘alright, we’ll see.’ He told me to ‘go to sleep.’ He was going in. So this game was for that kid or grown man or whoever that was. So I appreciate you. I told him I’d give him a shoutout, too. So that’s what tonight was…</p></blockquote> <h2><strong>Yup, Hollywood is making a <em>Roblox</em> movie</strong></h2> <p>Production company <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/11/grow-a-garden-movie-story-kitchen-in-development-1236608058/">Story Kitchen announced</a> that it is now developing a feature film based on the hit <em>Roblox</em> game <em>Grow a Garden, </em><a href="https://kotaku.com/grow-a-garden-roblox-5-million-active-users-record-pc-1851781824">one of the most popular user-created games</a> available in the free-to-play online metaverse for kids. At one point, <em>Grow a Garden</em> had over 20 million concurrent users, making it one of the most popular video games on the planet and beating everything on Steam.</p>

 <p>“<em>Grow a Garden</em> is exactly the kind of imaginative, heartfelt world we love to adapt,” said Story Kitchen co-founders Dmitri M. Johnson and Michael Lawrence Goldberg, “an uplifting story-world rooted in play, creativity, and community.” No release date for this one, and considering that Story Kitchen is already working on a slew of other video game adaptations–including <em>Split Fiction, It Takes Two, Sifu, Shinobi, </em>and <em>Toejam and Earl</em>–but has yet to complete and release most of them, I’m not holding my breath that this actually gets made. But we shall see.</p>

 <h2><strong>Netflix working on reality cooking show based on <em>Overcooked</em></strong></h2> <p>Speaking of video games getting turned into movies and TV shows, <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/11/overcooked-reality-competition-series-video-game-netflix-a24-1236608072/">Netflix has announced that it is working with A24</a> to develop a reality cooking show competition based on the hit co-op cooking game <em>Overcooked</em>. The game’s original devs are involved, and it’s reportedly going to be similar to Netflix’s other popular cooking shows, like <em>Nailed It.</em> While I enjoyed <em>Overcooked</em>, the game is nearly a decade old at this point, and it feels like perhaps Netflix waited too long to do something with it.</p> <h2><strong><em>Marvel Rivals</em> reveals new heroes via sneaky patch notes tease</strong></h2> <p><a href="https://www.polygon.com/marvel-rivals-rogue-gambit-patch-notes/">As spotted by <em>Polygon</em></a>, on Wednesday, <em>Marvel Rivals</em> developer NetEase Games <a href="https://www.marvelrivals.com/gameupdate/20251105/41548_1269153.html">posted some patch notes</a> for the popular hero shooter. And if you look closely at the top image of the post, you’ll spot what looks like Rogue and Gambit, two famous X-Men characters, hidden in the artwork. These heroes have been rumored to be coming to the game for some time now, alongside many others, so it’s not shocking that it looks like these two mutants will be making the leap to <em>Rivals</em> in the near future.</p> <h2>ICYMI:</h2> <ul> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/gta-6-leaks-delay-developers-fired-rockstar-games-union-2000641525">Rockstar claims fired devs were leaking secrets</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/sonics-latest-outing-is-a-grim-fall-guys-knock-off-with-60-skins-2000641427">The new <em>Sonic</em> game suuuuuccccckkkks</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-drone-glitch-fix-patch-ruining-matches-update-2000641355"><em>Battlefield 6′</em>s drone glitch is still causing problems, but a fix is coming soon</a></li> </ul> <h2>Watch This:</h2>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-roadmap-new-map-patch-barricade-2000641734</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/arc-raiders-has-a-big-roadmap-and-a-new-update-but-fans-want-some-things-kept-secret.1345903/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Last week, developer Embark Studios published their 2025<i> Arc Raiders</i> roadmap detailing what’s coming to the PvPvE extraction shooter through the rest of November and&nbsp; December. This includes a newly revealed 1.1.0 update that went live today, with some features arriving this weekend. But while fans are chiming in with requests for new features, some also want <i>Arc Raiders</i> to keep some surprises up its sleeves.</p> <p>Here’s where things stand in the massive hit multiplayer shooter a week since launch. Also, I have an epic video of someone taking down a Bastion with a pickaxe at the end. But first the game’s latest set of patch notes:</p> <h2>Patch 1.1.0 updates and changes</h2> <p>Thursday<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1808500/view/590661232047948062?l=english">’s 1.1.0 patch notes</a> detail some welcome quality-of-life changes, as well as a sneak peak of what’s dropping into the game on November 8 .</p>

 <p>Over the weekend, <i>Arc Raiders</i> will see three new map conditions arrive. For the uninitiated, map conditions change up what you can expect while out on the battlefield. For example, a “Lush Blooms” condition on a map means that you can expect more plant life and more fruits to harvest than normal.</p>

 <p>Following the latest update, Hidden Bunker, Electromagnetic Storm, and a Night Raid in Blue Gate will be added to the game. Hidden Bunker, as you can imagine, is a hidden loot spot you’ll have to unlock. Electromagnetic Storm (which was available during the Server Slam) sees deadly lightning strikes pose a risk to anyone on the map–maybe fire up some <i>Final Fantasy X</i> to prepare yourself?</p>

 <p>Right now, however, folks can expect the following tweaks to <i>Arc Raiders</i>’ gameplay:</p> <ul> <li aria-level="1">Fixed the issue where the Integrated Shield Recharger was only recharging when equipped.</li> <li aria-level="1">Fixed an issue where Augment skills sometimes did not work.</li> <li aria-level="1">Fixed exploit using deployables pushing players through walls.</li> <li aria-level="1">Added a charge progress for Integrated Shield repair.</li> <li aria-level="1">Fixed an issue where Health Regen skills wouldn’t work if they were triggered while DBNO.</li> <li aria-level="1">Fixed the bug where the Well-Travelled achievement wouldn’t register.</li> <li aria-level="1">Barricades can no longer be placed near zipline exit points.</li> <li aria-level="1">Added the Punch Hands emote (preorder bonus) in game.</li> <li aria-level="1">Changed the schedule so new Map Conditions become available Saturday.</li> </ul> <p>The most significant of these is the inability to plant a barricade in front of a zipline exit. Barricades are really generous with where they can be placed, letting you effectively block off doors. It seemed like only a matter of before this exploit was nerfed.</p>

 <h2><i>Arc Raiders</i>’ roadmap details a new map, new gear, and snow!</h2> <p><a href="https://arcraiders.com/en/news/2025-roadmap/">Later on in November</a>, folks can expect a new map to unlock the currently inaccessible “Stella Montis.” There’s also some new Arc enemies on the way called the “Matriarch” and “Shredder.” There will also be some new quests, and new guns with which to take them on.</p>

  <p>The December updates, however, sound even cooler. The maps will experience snow as a new environmental condition and the game’s first expedition departure window will open up.</p>

 <p>What’s an expedition? Instead of a global server wipe that nukes everyone’s gear, <i>Arc Raiders</i> has a unique seasonal mechanic that encourages you to invest a ton of gathered loot into a “Project” to build a caravan. Once you finish it, and once there’s an expedition departure window available, you can send your Raider out on a permanent expedition, allowing you to start up a new one.</p> <p>This will reset all your skill points and clear out your stash, as well as your workshop upgrades. You’ll keep all your cosmetics and your new Raider will also get an XP boost, extra materials from our pal Scrappy, easier weapon repairs, and more space in your stash.</p> <p>Most survival games have some kind of mechanic for wiping everyone’s progress, otherwise the game would just turn into a warzone of folks perpetually hoarding and stocking up on their best gear forever. We’ll see if this one can help make <i>Arc Raiders</i> palatable to casual players where other hardcore extraction shooters like <i>Escape from Tarkov</i> have failed.</p>

 <p>If you’re working on your Caravan right now, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1opk2ti/psa_for_all_raiders_dont_scrap_these_items/">OrganicAppointment43 on Reddit has kindly shared</a> a list of every piece of loot you’ll need to put it together:</p>   <h2>Fans still want some surprises kept secret</h2> <p>Since the early preview tests of the game, many fans have been asking for quality-of-life features like the ability to craft more of an item directly from a right-click submenu without diving into the various workshop submenus. One thing it seems many fans <i>don’t</i> want, however, is to know about future Arc enemies.</p>

   <p>“It would be very cool if new ARC just started appearing randomly,” <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1op9f2e/please_embark_keep_new_arc_units_secret/">a popular post on the game’s</a> subreddit says. Some players basically want the game to mimic <i>Helldivers 2</i>’s more organic way of evolving in which the developers don’t explicitly telegraph every change ahead of time.</p> <p>I have to echo this sentiment. So much of what makes a match of <i>Arc Raiders</i> fun is when the “unknown” happens: A Leaper arrives when you weren’t expecting it, a Tick jumps down on your face in true <i>Alien</i> facehugger fashion from a hiding spot you never anticipated, and so on. We know we’re getting two new Arc this month, but it sure would be nice if a few of the future ones remained a little hidden and were rolled out in secret.</p> <h2>Behold: Someone took down a Bastion with a friggin’ Pickaxe</h2> <p>If you’ve played any amount of <i>Arc Raiders</i>, you know your pickaxe is essential for breaking into caches and can prove a deadly melee weapon in a pinch. But as Reddit user NotaFTCAgent demonstrates, it can also deliver <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1onselo/last_night_i_had_my_lowest_low_so_far_lost_all_my/">a satisfying final blow to a friggin Bastion</a>:</p>    <p>Call him <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1onselo/comment/nmz5994/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">John of Arc</a>, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1onselo/comment/nn1baqv/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">Marc Raider</a>, or <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1onselo/comment/nn1s9q3/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">THOR with Mjolnir</a>, the dude needs a medal for that one.</p>

The success of Wordle inspired numerous spin-offs and social media challenges, leading to its acquisition by The New York Times in early 2022.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Assassin's Creed Shadows: Claws of Awaji Launch Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p><strong>"</strong>What happens when a legendary franchise reveals one of its most anticipated experiences? ... Only to become the game everyone loves to hate?" the narrator asks at the start of the video. "When conversation shifts from gameplay to ideology? When everything you say only adds fuel to the fire? And when the voices you thought were with you actually turn against you."</p><p>The video's narrator described the ire Ubisoft experienced after it revealed Shadows in 2024. To combat the ferocity, the company "had to stop focusing on those who hated us [and] start firing up our allies." Doing that meant one thing, according to the narrator: Ubisoft had to lean on The Assassin's Creed brand.</p><p>"We started by doing the last thing anyone would have advised. We delayed the game," the narrator continued. "The extra time allowed the devs to polish, optimize, and reach the high standards fans expect from an Assassin’s Creed game. It also gave us time to rebuild the Assassin’s Creed brand pact, putting the markers of the franchise back at the center. More hood, more stealth, more leap of faith, more lore. So we could show that the spirit of Assassin’s Creed lives on in Shadows."</p><p>The video lathers on this corporate speak for the rest of its runtime, according to a transcript in that November 5 Game File report. The narrator says that, by showing the game and letting the experience speak for itself, Ubisoft won fans back, shifted the conversation, and found the confidence to "stand tall, to take risks, to speak up, even against the loudest haters." There's no explicit mention of who the "haters" were, and Guillemot doesn't define the backlash Shadows faced in his remarks after the video either. However, he did hint at the "fake fights" caused by the tension between gameplay and history.</p><p>"We were initially surprised by the extent of the attacks,” Guillemot said. "And we quickly realized that it was a battle, a battle with our fans, to demonstrate that we were, in fact, more of a video game than a message.</p><p>"What we saw is that, by allowing our fans to see in the game--everything they were going to be able to rediscover--of what they love about Assassin’s Creed, [that] ultimately helped to combat this aggression, which is linked to the fact that video games have a very strong impact on the people who play them," Guillemot continued. "And so they’re kind of caught between 'I want to play, and what interests me is self-expression within a game' and 'there is a cultural message that comes with the video game.' So our goal is really to be able to ensure that our fans discover and defend what they expect from our games. It very quickly eliminated the fights, which were just fake fights."</p><p>Assassin's Creed Shadows received intense backlash for Yasuke, a Black slave who became a retainer for Oda Nobunaga, making him a samurai by association. The game was slammed for everything from being "woke propaganda" to featuring historical inaccuracies, and grew so intense that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-canceled-civil-war-based-assassins-creed-over-controversy-concerns-report/1100-6535320/" data-ref-id="1100-6535320">Ubisoft reportedly canceled a Civil War-inspired Assassin's Creed game</a> as a direct result. Despite all the controversy surrounding Shadows' Black co-protagonist, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-hits-5-million-players-2-billion-stealth-kills/1100-6533351/" data-ref-id="1100-6533351">the game still reached five million players</a> just five months after its February 14 launch.</p><p>The game, which received <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/assassins-creed-shadows-review-shinobi-simulator/1900-6418344/" data-ref-id="1900-6418344">an 8/10 in GameSpot's Assassin's Creed Shadows review</a>, received <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-claws-of-awaji-expansion-launches-in-september/1100-6533445/" data-ref-id="1100-6533445">the Claws of Awaji expansion</a> that introduced tons of new content.

            <p>The Dispatch original soundtrack will be coming to music streaming services in late November / December of this year. However, a certain special song present in the latest batch of episodes won't be present.</p>
<p>Speaking to Eurogamer, a PR representative confirmed that there were plans to bring the original score for Dispatch to music services after the conclusion of episode 8, though an exact date when these original songs will be streamable has yet to be confirmed.</p>
<p>As of writing, you can listen to much of the original score for Dispatch on the official Adhoc Studios YouTube channel, including the most recent upload of episode 5 &amp; 6's score. However, a certain song is absent from that upload. The song itself is a spoiler<strong>, which we'll discuss below.</strong></p>

<p>That song that won't be making it to streaming services is Flambae's karaoke cover of Meredith Brooks - Bitch, which plays in full during the credits of Episode 5. When asked whether Flambae's cover will also be making it to streaming services, a representative of Adhoc told Eurogamer: "We can't upload the Flambae cover, sadly. Maybe in the future, but right now we can't."</p><p>When asked why they can't include it on soundtracks, the spokesperson said that while the track itself is licensed, they: "don't have rights to throw it on soundtracks". However, they also added that they might consider re-negotiating this in the future. Given the success of Dispatch so far, this seems like a good move.</p>
<p>Dispatch has proven exceptionally popular since its initial batch of episodes came out in October, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/kapow-episodic-gaming-really-is-back-on-the-map-the-dispatch-success-story-continues">with the latest two episodes causing a new peak in players on Steam</a>. The game is selling well too, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/is-episodic-gaming-back-on-the-map-ex-wolf-among-us-devs-superhero-workplace-comedy-dispatch-sells-big-to-become-a-well-deserved-smash">pushing past 1m copies sold in ten days</a>.</p>

It's a pretty short one overall with few surprises, but one question regarding the Mario Kart franchise definitely piqued our interest.</p>
<p>Essentially, the query raises the possibility of another IP surpassing the sales of the Mario Kart franchise on Switch 2. As we know, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> has already sold 9.57 million units on new console, while <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/mario_kart_8_deluxe">Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</a> is comfortably the best-selling Switch game at an astonishing 69.56 million units.</p><div><figure data-videoid="_PuEn0ZOn5c" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_PuEn0ZOn5c?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="yt_PuEn0ZOn5c" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/_PuEn0ZOn5c?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_PuEn0ZOn5c?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed38f036jvhqlx&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>838k</span></a></p>

<p>Shigeru Miyamoto answered by stating that Nintendo has always worked with the belief that "there are no limits", citing the comparisons made between <strong>The Super Mario Bros. Movie</strong> and other films released around the same time. If the film has reached number one, Nintendo believes it can always strive to do more.</p>
<p>He goes on to say that the if a new IP resonates with players, then it could absolutely go on to commercial success. But then he counters this by stating that Mario Kart would continue to sell regardless, and so "it may never be surpassed".</p>
<p>Amusingly, he then recalls a conversation with <strong>Pokémon</strong> creator Satoshi Tajiri. Speaking about the creation of Pokémon in Japan, Tajiri had supposedly joked with Miyamoto, stating “if you want to surpass Nintendo’s Mario, you’ll have to sell two copies of the software to each customer". This is apparently one of the driving forces behind the decision to create <strong>Pokémon Red and Green</strong>.</p>
<p>Surpassing Mario Kart will definitely be a tricky task for any publisher, including Nintendo itself. Not even the might of games like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/animal_crossing_new_horizons">Animal Crossing: New Horizons</a> or <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_smash_bros_ultimate">Super Smash Bros. Ultimate</a> could knock Mario Kart 8 Deluxe off its throne.</p>
<p>We'll have to see how things pan out with the Switch 2 in the years to come.</p>

			<p>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2, one of the best games in 2025, and one of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/golden-joysticks-awards-2025-ultimate-game-of-the-year-award-major-indies-stacked/">games contending for game of the year</a> is going to be <a href="https://www.deepsilver.com/games/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii/news/play-kingdom-come-deliverance-ii-for-free-this-weekend-on-steam">free for players to try on Steam and Xbox Series X/S starting today</a>, November 6, 2025, until this coming Monday, November 10, 2025. This free weekend comes just ahead of the launch of its third and final DLC, Mysteria Ecclesiae, which launches on November 11, 2025.</p>



<p>Along with the free weekend, if you do decide to grab the full game, then you'll get it at a 40% off discount on both Steam and Xbox, though PlayStation fans seem to be left out of the fun, as there is no mention of a free weekend for PlayStation or a discount on PlayStation consoles.</p>

<p>When Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 released at the beginning of this year in February, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii/">Wccftech's reviewer, Chris Wray, gave the game a 10/10, writing</a>, "<em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 is a resounding success, delivering one of the most believable game worlds ever, layered with compelling quests, small and large alike, and enhancing the already interesting systems introduced in the original. With multiple systems layered to immerse you in the game, as well as an intriguing story and excellent polish, it makes for one of the more captivating open world RPGs.</em>"</p>

			<p>A new Assassin’s Creed Mirage update will launch together with the Valley of Memory expansion to introduce gameplay changes and new features, Ubisoft confirmed.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/it-it/game/assassins-creed/news/62bserGVoUbHQPrsGCasOU/assassins-creed-mirage-new-gameplay-features-and-valley-of-memory-expansion">The new update</a> launching together with <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-mirage-valley-of-memory-free-dlc-release-date-reveal-november/">the free expansion on November 18</a> on all formats will introduce some brand new features, starting with the ability to replay all black box missions and contracts after they have been cleared once. Each replayable mission presents distinct challenges that require players to approach these missions creatively, such as avoiding the use of Eagle Vision, targeting only the main enemy, and more. Completing these missions grants the player exclusive in-game rewards usable in New Game +.</p>



<p>The upcoming free Assassin’s Creed Mirage update will also introduce a new free jump option that will allow players to jump manually, a new control scheme to smooth parkour that works better with free jump turned on, a Back and Side Ejects Mode, which allows Basim to perform ejects regardless of the presence of a safe landing spot and a few other parkous tweaks to make the experience smoother.</p>



<p>Finally, the new Assassin’s Creed Mirage update will also add a new skill called Engineer 2 that will allow him to equip all level 1 enhancements to his tools, and a new level 3 modification that will power up every tool. Rounding up the new features included in the update is the inclusion of new difficulty levels called Hardened Assassin, which will sport enemies with higher defense than Assassin difficulty, and Ultimate Assassin, the hardest difficulty in the game.</p>



<p>Assassin’s Creed Mirage is now available on PC, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S and Xbox One. You can learn more about the game which brought back the classic series' gameplay formula by checking out <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/assassins-creed-mirage/">Nathan Birch's review.</a></p>

		<p><em>Remember when you’d walk into a local music, book, or video store and there’d be an adorable section where the employees would recommend what they were interested in that month?&nbsp;</em></p><p><em>Welcome to our little version of it, called Remap Recommends.&nbsp;</em></p><p><em>It's a chance for the staff at Remap to let you know what they've been playing, reading, listening to, or watching.</em></p><hr><h3 id="patrick-recommends-long-story-short">Patrick Recommends: Long Story Short</h3><figure><figcaption><span>This scene is less familiar growing up, more familiar in the car with my own kids. Credit: Netflix</span></figcaption></figure><p>As the saying goes, there is universality in specificity. That is no more present than in one of my favorite television series this year, Netflix's <em>Long Story Short</em>, aka the tremendous new series from <em>Bojack Horseman</em> creator Raphael Bob-Waksberg.</p><p><em>Bojack Horseman</em> was a <em>bummer</em>. An insightful show, but quite often bleak enough to make it challenging to hold onto the ideas the show had about hope, redemption, forgiveness, and becoming a better person amidst the pain you have caused others. (Forgiveness isn't about another person being "okay" with you, it's living with knowing you fucked up.) <em>Long Story Short</em> channels a similar level of absurdist humor—<em>god</em>, the episode about Yoshi trying to start his own business inside his parent's house—without relying on the visual gag of lol talking animals. </p><p>(I am not trying to reduce the show to lol talking animals, but that part helped!)</p><p><em>Long Story Short</em> has little that I can personally relate to in terms of family dynamics. A mother more parts bully than loving parent. Siblings who snipe at each other. A deeply religious household. But I do know what it's like to not understand the person a parent performs in public and the person they reveal themselves to be at home. I do know what it's like to fight with a sibling, while you unconditionally love them. I do know what it means for a family to have <em>passions</em>. </p><p>My family is not the Schwoopers, but there is Schwooper-isms in the Klepeks.</p><p>P.S. Outside of <em>The Pitt</em>, this might have one of the most interesting and realistic depictions of what it was like to live out COVID-19 in terms of personal experience. </p><hr><h3 id="rob-recommends-john-carpenter%E2%80%99s-christine">Rob Recommends: John Carpenter’s <em>Christine</em></h3><figure><figcaption><span>Well, at least the burning car looks beautiful. Credit: Columbia Pictures</span></figcaption></figure><p>The Formula 1 podcast I do with Draw Scanlon and Danny O’Dwyer, <a href="https://www.f1.cool/?ref=remapradio.com" rel="noreferrer"><em>Shift+F1</em></a>, does the standard <a href="https://www.patreon.com/cw/shiftf1?ref=remapradio.com" rel="noreferrer">monthly movie episode for Patrons</a>. We’ve far from exhausted every racing movie and documentary ever made, but we’ve definitely had to expand our purview from movies about racing to movies about cars to movies that maybe just <em>have </em>cars prominently featured. Which is how I unexpectedly found my favorite John Carpenter film.</p>
