If you’re in the market for a gaming-centric OLED for your PC, check out the excellent <strong>LG UltraGear 27-inch 27GR95QE-B</strong> currently selling for $656.99 ($340 off) at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/LG-UltragearTM-Monitor-nVIDIA%C2%AE-Compatible/dp/B0BRBW8KRK?tag=theverge02-20">Amazon</a> and <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1745626-REG%2Flg_27gr95qe_b_27_ultragear_curved_oled.html">B&amp;H Photo</a> or $659.99 at <a href="https://howl.me/cmsFh5YsdmP">Best Buy</a>.</p><p>This LG model may not be gargantuan or capable of native 4K, but its modestly sized 27-inch OLED panel has crisp QHD (2560 x 1440) resolution. It’s got the deep blacks and strong color contrast you expect in an OLED, and since it’s designed for gaming, it can reach up to 240Hz over its DisplayPort 1.4 or twin HDMI 2.1 ports — making it a great choice for pulling double-duty if you use both PC and current consoles at your desk. In fact, it has a built-in downscaler to ensure all the 4K content from a PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, or high-end gaming PC looks excellent.</p><div><p>LG’s 27GR95QE-B is a 27-inch gaming monitor with a high-quality 2560 x 1440 OLED panel that supports up to 240Hz refresh for fast performance in competitive games. It has HDMI 2.1 ports with built-in downscaling for making 4K content look good on its 1440p display. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22336413/lg-27gr95qe-b-oled-gaming-monitor-review">Read our review</a>.</p></div><p>If 27 inches seems too small and the 16:9 aspect ratio too mundane for such fancy panel technology, you can also check out the larger ultrawide <strong>34-inch LG UltraGear 34GS95QE-B curved OLED</strong> selling for $819.99 ($480 off) at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/LG-34GS95QE-Ultragear-DisplayHDR-DisplayPort/dp/B0CV27X9K7?th=1&amp;tag=theverge02-20">Amazon</a> and <a href="https://howl.me/cmsFhmo5kH5">Best Buy</a>. It’s pricier, sure, but it carries similar specs in a 21:9 aspect ratio with about seven inches of extra screen width.</p><p><h3>Cooking up some more Frideals</h3></p><div><ul><li>The <strong>8BitDo Ultimate C Wired Controller</strong> is just $16.99 ($3 off) at Amazon in either <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0C2TXM992/?tag=theverge02-20">purple</a> or <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0C2TW2X65/?th=1&amp;tag=theverge02-20">green</a> pastel colors. It’s hard to get much more affordable than this for a no-frills controller for PC, Android, or the Steam Deck. While the price is low, these 8BitDo controllers have a nice build, comfy ergonomics, and excellent D-pads.</li><li><a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8836598/type/dlg/https://computers.woot.com/offers/nordvpn-standard-1-year-vpn-cybersecurity-3">Woot</a> is selling one year of <strong>NordVPN service</strong> for just $19.99 (regularly around $60). It’s a digital code that will be emailed to you, and Woot’s listing indicates that it’s valid for new and existing NordVPN subscribers.

<p id="HylhWL">While useless on their own, the<strong> left and right halves</strong> combined grant access to the Consecrated Snowfield, the western part of the snowy Mountaintops of the Giants region, and perhaps the game’s most infamous boss — <a href="https://www.polygon.com/elden-ring-guide-walkthrough/24176307/malenia-location-weakness-strategy-how-to-beat">Malenia</a>. This location guide will show you <strong>where to find the Haligtree Secret Medallions</strong>.</p>
<p id="NLmzR6"><strong>Tip:</strong> Before you start searching for the Secret Medallions in <em>Elden Ring</em>, check your inventory. If you’ve explored the southern parts of Liurnia, you may have collected the “Haligtree Secret Medallion (Right)” already!</p>

<p id="5j1uNo">The right half of the Secret Medallion is found in the <strong>southern part of Liurnia</strong>, which means you can access its location as soon as you’ve defeated <a href="https://www.polygon.com/elden-ring-guide-walkthrough/22960296/godrick-the-grafted-weakness-location-boss-fight-stormveil-castle-strategy-rune">Godrick the Grafted</a> in <a href="https://www.polygon.com/elden-ring-guide-walkthrough/22957293/stormveil-castle-map-tips-tricks-hidden-path-strategy-knight-map">Stormveil Castle</a>.

<p id="fenPFB">At last, you’ve reached the Secret Medallion location. If you follow the path just a bit further, you’ll see a dark corner on your right, with a small stone tomb in front and a large tree on the left. In this dark corner, as pointed out by the arrow, there’s a <strong>large pot</strong> — this is Old Albus in disguise. Hit the pot once to <strong>reveal Old Albus</strong> and exhaust his dialogue, after which he’ll hand you the <strong>Haligtree Secret Medallion (Right)</strong>.</p>

<p id="YtkwJJ">To reach Castle Sol, you must cross the narrow bridge toward the north, ride through a valley until you see a massive giant ahead of you, then turn left. Keep riding until you hit a seemingly dead end, then use the wind current on your left (shown in the picture) and fly up the mountains. Cross another bridge (going north again), then ride down the snowy slopes — Castle Sol is in the lower valley.</p>

  <p id="Auq0Rv">Looking for an <a href="https://www.polygon.com/elden-ring-guide-walkthrough"><em>Elden Ring</em></a> <strong>Malenia boss guide</strong>? Malenia, Blade of Miquella, Goddess of Rot, and bearer of a shard of the <em>Elden Ring</em>, is one of the toughest bosses in the game — and that’s saying something.</p>
<p id="HJ8sAe">Don’t let that discourage you though; with the right preparations and a good battle strategy, even Malenia can be defeated. Our <em>Elden Ring</em> guide will show you <strong>how to beat Malenia</strong>, including details about her location, weaknesses, and attacks.</p>

<hr id="NTApkT">

<p id="EyNyVT">Malenia resides at the bottom of the Haligtree, the relatively small region found north of the Mountaintops of the Giants. To get there, you must advance through <a href="https://www.polygon.com/elden-ring-guide-walkthrough/22972704/liurnia-of-the-lakes-dungeon-locations-rewards">Liurnia</a>, Altus Plateau, and the eastern part of the Mountaintops of the Giants before collecting the Elden Ring <a href="https://www.polygon.com/e/23934763">Haligtree Secret Medallions</a> and gaining access to the Consecrated Snowfield. </p>

<h2 id="NqdRWN"><strong>Things to know about Malenia</strong></h2>
<ul>
<li id="BC8vp7">
<strong>She heals with every hit.</strong> Malenia regains health every time she lands a hit on you, even if you block it. For that reason, using a shield in this fight is not advised.</li>
<li id="0a42wS">
<strong>She deals physical damage</strong> with slash and pierce attacks. During the second phase of the fight, she’ll inflict Scarlet Rot.</li>
<li id="n2b5Vk">
<strong>She has multiple one-hit-kill attacks.</strong> No matter how high you pump your vigor or how heavy your armor is, you can and will be one-shotted by several of Malenia’s attacks. You must learn to avoid them. We’ll go over them below.</li>
<li id="1oYmPe">
<strong>She does have weaknesses.</strong> Malenia is almost unbelievably strong, but she does have weaknesses. We’ll tell you exactly what to bring to this fight.</li>
<li id="euwMKN">
<strong>Summons are key.</strong> Summoning other players for this fight is a gamble. You might get lucky, or your phantom helpers might die the first time Malenia uses Waterfowl Dance, leaving Malenia with beefed-up health while you’re still fighting her solo. Using a <a href="https://www.polygon.com/elden-ring-guide-walkthrough/23022025/best-summons-spirit-ashes-how-to-upgrade">Spirit Ash</a> is a more reliable choice. We’ll go over your best options in the guide.</li>

<h2 id="LLHJB5"><strong>Malenia’s weakness and resistances</strong></h2>
<p id="7xzKih">Luckily, even Malenia is weak to certain damage and attack types. Here’s a list of <strong>everything Malenia is weak against</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li id="3gWs0H">
<strong>Frost damage</strong>. This is Malenia’s lowest resistance.</li>
<li id="M7MYjl">
<strong>Bleed damage</strong>, also known as Blood Loss. This is Malenia’s second-lowest resistance.</li>
<li id="IEfYeb">
<strong>Fire damage</strong>. While using magical spells isn’t the best strategy against Malenia (more on that below), weapons with innate fire damage work great. </li>
<li id="fk6pfe">
<strong>Physical damage</strong>. Melee attacks can work very well against Malenia.</li>
</ul>
<p id="smXzf7">To avoid using this, here’s a list of <strong>everything Malenia is exceptionally strong against</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li id="5V2dDE">
<strong>Scarlet Rot damage</strong>. Malenia is highly resistant to the Scarlet Rot status effect.</li>
<li id="d3AqrV">
<strong>Poison damage</strong>. Malenia is highly resistant to the poison status effect.</li>
<li id="b0wzSh">
<strong>Holy damage</strong>. Malenia has a high Holy damage absorption. If you have a Faith build, it’s better to use fire incantations like Burn O Flame instead of Holy damage.</li>
<li id="eZ2zn7">
<strong>Most magic</strong>. Malenia will easily dodge most sorceries and incantations you can throw at her. There are exceptions, like the Night sorceries, Ranni’s Dark Moon, and Dragonice. But even then, it’s hard to find enough time to cast them. To top it off, landing spells on Malenia often triggers her most devastating attack, Waterfowl Dance.</li>
<li id="FHqIXT">
<strong>Shields</strong>. Malenia heals herself even if you block her attack with your shield, so using one puts you at a serious disadvantage.</li>
<li id="AVtOwh">
<strong>Parrying</strong>. Unfortunately, Malenia will only be staggered by every third parry, instead of every parry like a normal enemy. It’s doable, but not recommended.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="kyzFei"><strong>Prepare for the Malenia boss fight</strong></h2>
<p id="Isui5x">Now that you know Malenia’s strengths and weaknesses, how do you exploit them? Here’s a list of combat strategies that work well against Malenia:</p>
<ul>
<li id="xHtscI">
<strong>Use dual-wielding</strong>. Forget about shields; dual-wield two weapons of the same type instead. This allows you to power-stance, which unlocks new attacks using the L1 button. Fast weapons like katanas or twinblades are best, but greatswords like the Claymore can work if you have more strength than dexterity. Whatever you choose, make sure to upgrade both weapons as much as possible. </li>
<li id="IiyJJK">
<strong>Use a light load</strong>. Malenia is fast and you don’t have a shield, so you must rely on dodging to stay alive. A heavy load makes things difficult, a medium load is doable, but a light load of less than 30% maximum equipment makes dodging easy. Then again, this is a very risky strategy — one mistake could tilt the fight in Malenia’s favor. </li>
<li id="Kcm9KH">
<strong>Or at least not a heavy load</strong>. You can use a heavy weapon, but don’t go for a full heavy loadout as you won’t be able to dodge Malenia’s attacks. Basically, choose the most powerful armor set you have that still falls within medium load range. </li>
<li id="JL7oZt">
<strong>Build resistance against physical damage</strong>. Armor sets with high resistance against slash and pierce are always the best choice. Don’t forget to combine them with a physical damage-reducing talisman like the Dragoncrest Greatshield.</li>
<li id="1VWRLp">
<strong>Make dodging easier with Bloodhound’s Step</strong>. If the light load sounds too difficult, you may imbue your right-hand weapon with the Bloodhound’s Step Ash of War. This is a souped-up dodge that causes you to briefly turn invisible and slide around the room, totally impervious to damage. Without a doubt, it’s the single best tool to give you a slight edge against Malenia. You can get it by defeating the Night’s Cavalry mini-boss at the bridge north of Lenne’s Rise in eastern Caelid.</li>
<li id="WexPSP">
<strong>Exploit Malenia’s Frost weakness</strong>. Imbue at least one of your weapons with the Cold Affinity. Grab the <strong>Glintstone Whetblade</strong> from the courtyard of Raya Lucaria, or use Dragonice, purchased at the Cathedral of Dragon Communion in Caelid (though its slow cast time leaves you vulnerable). The same goes for Ranni’s Dark Moon, which you can get by following <a href="https://www.polygon.com/elden-ring-guide-walkthrough/22982931/ranni-questline-renna-radahn-nokron-eternal-city-three-sisters">Ranni’s</a> questline and reaching the Moonlight Plateau. If you’d rather just chuck grenades at her, the recipe for Freezing Pots is in the Glintstone Craftsman’s Cookbook [6], located in a building on the east side of the main courtyard of <a href="https://www.polygon.com/elden-ring-guide-walkthrough/22994833/caria-manor-boss-location-level-map-dragon-sword">Caria Manor</a>.</li>
<li id="teOrHY">
<strong>Focus on causing Bleed damage</strong>. Thanks to its innate Bleed damage, Rivers of Blood is one of the best weapons against Malenia. If using a katana or another weapon with innate Bleed damage is not an option for your build, go get the <strong>Black Whetblade</strong> at Night’s Sacred Ground, a part of Nokron, Eternal City accessed by jumping down the rooftops near the Ancestral Woods site of grace (down the meteor hole that appeared after you defeat <a href="https://www.polygon.com/elden-ring-guide-walkthrough/22993446/radahn-location-general-starscourge">Radahn</a>). The whetblade enables you to add Blood Affinity to most weapons that have no innate element.</li>
<li id="tpdD99">
<strong>Deal fire damage</strong>. If you have a weapon with innate Fire damage, such as the Magma Blade, that’s a great option too. You can obtain it at <a href="https://www.polygon.com/elden-ring-guide-walkthrough/23013379/questline-boss-invitation-locked-door-npcs-hidden-wall-secret-wall-stonesword-key-room">Volcano Manor</a>, where it’s dropped by man-serpents. Alternatively, bring some Volcano Pots and chuck them at Malenia whenever you can. </li>
<li id="utWVjI">
<strong>Stagger Malenia.</strong> Yes, you can stagger Malenia, and it’s actually not that hard. Wait for her to finish an attack combo, then hit her immediately afterward to stagger her. </li>
<li id="CIvrLN">
<strong>Get a Scarlet Rot cure</strong>. Last but certainly not least, bring enough Preserving Boluses with you to cure Scarlet Rot in the second phase of the battle. The crafting recipe is found in Armorer’s Cookbook [6].</li>
</ul>

<hr id="4uQH6b">
<h2 id="rJS4fI"><strong>Best weapons for Malenia</strong></h2>
<p id="zpV7hs">Let’s go over some build examples you may use against Malenia. A solid choice for dual-wielding would be the <strong>Cold Uchigatana</strong> with Bloodhound’s Step in your right hand and <strong>Rivers of Blood</strong> in your left hand. When using Bloodhound’s Step, equip the Carian Filigreed Crest talisman, which you can purchase from the blacksmith Iji when following Ranni’s quest. It reduces the FP cost of skills, allowing you to teleport-dodge more frequently. </p>
<p id="5jP9wC">The <strong>Nagakiba</strong> katana and <strong>Eleonora’s Poleblade</strong> are also great weapons against Malenia, especially since both come with Bleed damage and (in the case of the Poleblade) Fire damage. Nagakiba is obtained by completing Bloody Finger Hunter Yura’s questline or by defeating him in combat, and Eleonora’s Poleblade is obtained by defeating Eleonora, the Violet Bloody Finger, at the Second Church of Marika in Altus Plateau</p>
<p id="yAxJqs">Don’t underestimate the <strong>Bloodhound’s Fang</strong> either, which has amazing physical damage. You can get it by defeating the Bloodhound Knight Darriwil in Limgrave. Dual-wielding this weapon is quite overpowered as it builds Bleed incredibly fast, but you can only obtain a second Bloodhound’s Fang if it’s gifted to you in <a href="https://www.polygon.com/elden-ring-guide-walkthrough/22948338/multiplayer-summon-finger-items">multiplayer</a>. If that’s not in the cards, Bloodhound’s Fang goes perfectly fine with Rivers of Blood. </p>
<p id="E912aD">If you’d rather try to stagger Malenia with a heavier weapon, the <strong>Blasphemous Blade </strong>Greatsword with its massive physical and fire damage is one of the best options. Its Taker’s Flames ability deals amazing stagger damage, knocking Malenia down if you can manage to land it without her dodging the flames. You can trade Rykard’s Remembrance for it in the Roundtable Hold. </p>
<p id="9d4TM9">If you’re looking for a way to ‘cheese’ the Malenia boss fight, the <strong>Ordovis Greatsword</strong> is your friend. This is quite surprising, especially since some of its damage is Holy, but the Ordovis Greatsword’s value lies in its <strong>Ordovis’s Vortex</strong> spinning skill (demonstrated in the picture below).</p>
<p id="gBugD8">This attack requires a short charging time, but if Malenia gets caught in it, she can’t break away and it’ll knock her down — allowing you to use it again. In other words, you must carefully wait for an opening, stun-lock Malenia in Ordovis’s Vortex, and deplete her HP. Ordovis Greatsword is dropped by the Crucible Knight in Auriza Hero’s Grave, a dungeon north of <a href="https://www.polygon.com/elden-ring-guide-walkthrough/22982996/leyndell-royal-capital-site-of-grace-tips-tricks-hidden-path-strategy-boss-morgott">Leyndell</a>. </p>

<h2 id="noKJdz"><strong>Best Ashes and Talismans for Malenia</strong></h2>
<p id="csDvOi">Besides <strong>Bloodhound’s Step</strong>, there are other <strong>Ashes of War</strong> that Malenia has a hard time dealing with. Rivers of Blood’s<strong> Corpse Piler</strong> can rapidly proc Bleed and staggers her somewhat reliably. You get it from the NPC invader near the Church of Repose in Mountaintop of the Giants.</p>
<p id="kXryMf">Similarly, Eleonora’s Poleblade’s<strong> Bloodblade Dance</strong> lets you do heavy Bleed and poise damage then dance away from her to avoid retaliation. It’s obtained from the NPC invasion at the Second Church of Marika in Altus Plateau as part of <a href="https://www.polygon.com/elden-ring-guide-walkthrough/24168717/yura-bloody-finger-hunter-questline-steps">Yura’s</a> questline.</p>
<p id="6qgTc7">The <a href="https://www.polygon.com/elden-ring-guide-walkthrough/23022025/best-summons-spirit-ashes-how-to-upgrade"><strong>best Spirit Ashes</strong></a> to use against Malenia are <strong>Black Knife Tiche</strong> or <strong>Mimic Tear</strong>. Unfortunately, tanky spirits aren’t as good as you might think because Malenia will regain health every time she hits them. Tiche, on the other hand, doesn’t have a ton of health but is excellent at dodging.</p>
<p id="FCsJ5h">She’ll distract Malenia while you unleash your attacks. You can get Tiche from the Ringleader’s Evergaol on the Moonlight Plateau (once again, part of Ranni’s quest). As long as you have a decent loadout, the Mimic Tear is always a great choice, but especially if you’re focused on building Frost and Bleed status effects. </p>
<p id="iWZp81">As for <a href="https://www.polygon.com/elden-ring-guide-walkthrough/23065127/every-talisman-map-location-pouch"><strong>talismans</strong></a>, the <strong>Dragoncrest Greatshield Talisman</strong> is incredibly useful as it negates a lot of incoming physical damage. <strong>Erdtree’s Favor</strong> can help you increase your equipment load limit (especially handy if your favorite armor set is a tad too heavy) while also improving your HP and stamina. For those who depend on vigor, strength, dexterity, and endurance, <strong>Radagon’s Scarseal</strong> is an amazing option, but beware that it also increases incoming damage. A simple strength-boosting talisman like <strong>Starscourge Heirloom</strong> may therefore be the better choice.</p>

<h2 id="hgtiJJ"><strong>How to defeat Malenia phase 1</strong></h2>
<p id="xMuU6o">Malenia will approach you as soon as you enter the boss arena. When she’s within melee range, be prepared to dodge her first attacks. The trick to surviving is to be very patient, keep dodging, and hit whenever her combos have finished. </p>
<p id="dDkBjb">If you’re able to proc Bleed and Frost multiple times, you can burn her down before she even gets a chance to use Waterfowl Dance. Most of the time, mastering this phase is simply a matter of keeping your distance so she doesn’t catch you by surprise, managing your FP so you can always use Bloodhound’s Step to get away from Waterfowl Dance, and being smart about when you try to get in a hit or two.</p>
<p id="Ba6gel">Here’s an overview of the attacks used by Malenia in the first phase of the battle:</p>

<ul>
<li id="x7cP3P">
<strong>Idling</strong>. Malenia’s idle state during the first phase of her fight is to simply walk slowly toward you. There’s an opportunity to attack here, as it’s often safe to walk up and poke her with a single probing attack while she’s doing this. Just be ready to dodge away when she inevitably responds. You can “trigger” her idling stance if you dodge away and create a lot of distance between you and Malenia.</li>
<li id="7a51pV">
<strong>Side jump</strong>. Sometimes, when dodging or after taking a hit, Malenia will jump to the left (your left) and have a brief moment of poise break. It’s a great opportunity to land another hit, as she won’t attack immediately afterward. You can try to do a quick stab during idling and follow it up with another attack after a side jump. </li>

<ul>
<li id="HPEWb0">
<strong>Normal slashes</strong>. Malenia has a bevy of general slashing attacks using her extra-long katana. She combines these in unpredictable patterns that make them challenging to dodge. Bloodhound’s step makes it easier. In general, you want to keep a medium distance from her for most of the fight, and never try to sneak an attack in during her standard slashing combos. She will punish you almost every time.</li>
<li id="CCTqFg">
<strong>Spin kick</strong>. Malenia often opens her combos with a deadly spin kick, which can’t be blocked or parried. Thankfully, it’s slow and the windup is obvious. Since her follow-ups can be more deadly, get some distance when she kicks. Don’t try to attack after it.</li>

<ul>
<li id="SDrYsh">
<strong>Spark Combo</strong>. One of Malenia’s most common attacks is a quadruple-slash combo that’s telegraphed by a mechanical sound effect and orange spark from her prosthetic arm. Get used to recognizing this cue and get the hell out of her way when she unleashes this, which she does constantly. With Bloodhound’s Step, you can teleport backward and get out of its range. It’s more difficult to avoid with a normal dodge, so you must make sure you’re far enough away from her at all times. </li>
<li id="r3QwFX">There are two variations of that move. You can tell which version you’re getting by the fourth slash in the combo: If the fourth slash arrives quickly after the third, the combo is likely to continue. However, if there’s a slightly longer delay before the fourth slash arrives, she’s about to stop moving for a moment, providing one of your best attack opportunities in the fight.</li>

<ul><li id="KEC214">
<strong>Spark thrust</strong>. This move is predicated by the same sound effect and orange spark as the previous one, but Malenia’s stance is completely different; she hops in the air for a moment while drawing her sword back, then thrusts towards you. This is the single best attack opportunity during phase 1, as there’s a way to predict it (it often triggers when you create a bit of distance between you and Malenia) and dodge; you don’t even have to use Bloodhound’s Step. And she never follows it up with anything during this phase, so you’re always safe to get a slash or two in after she uses it.</li></ul>

<ul>
<li id="BaK28x">
<strong>Slow lunge combo</strong>. When Malenia draws her sword slowly behind her in a crouch, she’s about to lunge toward you for a two-slash combo. There are two variations of this, with slightly different timing. You’ll have to learn the difference, although Bloodhound’s Step makes it easy to dodge either one. This is another attack opportunity — she’s vulnerable after the second swing, and if you’re near her when she starts winding it up, you can even get some hits in before she lunges.</li>
<li id="jn9nuO">
<strong>Overhead jump slash</strong>. This attack is similar to the previous one, but without the long wind-up. It’s always preceded by a standard horizontal slash, and often follows the fast version of the four-slash Spark Combo. It’s another great opportunity to attack, as she’s vulnerable after landing.</li>

<strong>Lunging Grab</strong>. Malenia pulls her left hand back, crouching down slightly, and lunges at you after a short delay. Avoid this at all costs. It’s easy to dodge, but is also guaranteed to kill you if it lands. We’ve never survived this attack with any build. Thankfully, once you dodge it successfully, it’s another opportunity for you to attack.</li></ul>

<strong>Waterfowl Dance</strong>. This is the big one. Once her health drops below 75%, Malenia can unleash the deadly Waterfowl Dance any time. She jumps into the air for a long pause (see picture above, make sure you recognize it!), then flies toward you, unleashing a flurry of white slashes. This will kill you if she catches you in it — and yes, it’s borderline unfair. Thankfully, it can be dodged. As soon as she rises into the air, you have to sprint or Bloodhound Step away from her as quickly as possible (this is the main reason why you can’t spend the whole fight up in the boss’s face pressuring her with attacks; if you’re right under her when she does this, it’s almost impossible to survive, even with Bloodhound’s Step). If you can catch enough distance, the first two parts of the Dance will miss you. For the third flurry, she always teleports directly to you, no matter how far away you got; you have to dodge toward her as soon as she does it. She’ll shoot past you, and you can hover just outside of her range for the fourth part, including the final spherical slash that marks the move’s conclusion. After this, she’s vulnerable to another attack — provided you survive that long. </li></ul>

<strong>Rot Nuke</strong>. Malenia flies up into the air, orange and scarlet wings fluttering, and pauses before dive-bombing you. You can survive this by dodging at the exact right moment — try activating Bloodhound’s Step as soon as she begins moving from her floating stance. Then, if you survive the initial impact, the boss explodes again as her petals open, turning her into a huge orange flower. Stay out of range as the petals open to avoid the damage and scarlet rot build-up they cause. This is your one reliable ranged attack opportunity during the fight; you can unleash spells, incantations, and throwables while she’s recovering. You can also rush in as the petals finally dissipate to attack her briefly up close. She always opens the second phase with this attack, so it’s imperative that you learn how to dodge it.</li></ul>

<strong>Phantom clones</strong>. Malenia floats into the air and sends a series of phantom clones slashing and thrusting your way. This attack is fairly easy to recognize as Malenia will fly upward in a glowing whirlwind, but the phantoms are hard to dodge. With Bloodhound’s Step, you can simply spam L2, provided you have enough FP. She ends this attack by lunging toward you herself with a powerful sword thrust. She’s vulnerable to attacks afterward, if you’re close enough to her after dodging, though it’s a small window, since she usually starts up another combo a moment after landing.</li></ul>

<ul><li id="6Mpm4L">
<strong>Small scarlet flower</strong>. Malenia plants a small orange bloom in front of her, which explodes a moment later, causing damage and scarlet rot build-up. Sometimes she flies into the air for a moment, but not always. This is the reason why your attack opportunities from phase 1 are unreliable now. Malenia retains all the same moves and combos from before, but now, she has a roughly 50% chance to follow up any move with this ability. Any combo after which she would have previously been vulnerable, from the Spark Thrust to the Slow Lunge, can be followed by this attack instead. Luckily, she always pauses on the ground as the small flower blows up. If you can get behind her and avoid the small explosion, there’s still a window to attack here.</li></ul>
<p id="GdBvSA">In addition to those new abilities, <strong>Malenia retains all the moves from phase 1</strong>. Beware that her combos are even more unpredictable as she tends to fly up into the air more often. Since she spends so much time in the air, it’s harder to predict when Waterfowl Dance is coming. Your only safe bet is to run away anytime she flies upward and get ready to dodge whatever attack is coming. Keep your distance, be patient, wait for your attack opportunities, and keep your FP and health topped up.</p>
<p id="Dj9Aom">When defeated, Malenia drops the <strong>Remembrance of the Rot Goddess</strong>, Malenia’s <strong>Great Rune</strong>, and a whopping <strong>480,000 runes</strong> on your first playthrough. If you manage to take her down, congratulations — you’re a true Tarnished, no matter how you did it.</p>

There’s no major boss battle here, mind you, but the combat can catch you off guard if you’re under-leveled. The strongest monster you’ll face here is level 18, so use that information to decide if you’d like to tackle other quests to level up first.</p><p>With that out of the way, here’s how to complete each phase of this quest.</p><figure id="" data-id="13b8c9617df6fedaf60c00dea5986934" data-recommend-id="image://13b8c9617df6fedaf60c00dea5986934" data-format="jpg" data-width="1600" data-height="900" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Nozuchi gives his first riddle." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Nozuchi gives his first riddle." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Atlus / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="13b8c9617df6fedaf60c00dea5986934" data-recommend-id="image://13b8c9617df6fedaf60c00dea5986934" data-format="jpg" data-width="1600" data-height="900" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Nozuchi gives his first riddle." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><h2 id="h124292"><a id=""></a>Beastly Battle of Wits Step 1: The Question</h2><p>After accepting the quest, talk to Nozuchi again.

Fortunately, the stakes for this question are very low. <strong>If you get the answer wrong, you can talk to Nozuchi again and pick a different answer with no consequence</strong>.</p><p>That said, if you want to save yourself the trial and error, the correct answer here is “<strong>An empty path</strong>.”</p><figure id="" data-id="b558a2a0ece1eee96546531b7c0c2af4" data-recommend-id="image://b558a2a0ece1eee96546531b7c0c2af4" data-format="jpg" data-width="1600" data-height="900" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Nozuchi gives his second riddle." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Nozuchi gives his second riddle." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Atlus / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="b558a2a0ece1eee96546531b7c0c2af4" data-recommend-id="image://b558a2a0ece1eee96546531b7c0c2af4" data-format="jpg" data-width="1600" data-height="900" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Nozuchi gives his second riddle." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><h2 id="h124293"><a id=""></a>Beastly Battle of Wits Step 2: Where to find the Sangaku Beads</h2><p>For the next phase of the quest, Nozuchi will ask you to find some Sangaku Beads that it has hidden. By talking with it, we can ascertain that the beads are hidden on “a hill of green,” and we’re looking for a dead end in the Shiba region. Also, by talking with Nozuchi again, we’ll learn that the “green” we’re looking for refers to the monsters you’ll find there (as opposed to any greenery you may find in this barren desert).</p><p>If you look through the monsters you’ve encountered to this point, you’ll figure out that the green spirits Nozuchi refers to are <strong>Kodama</strong>. So, if you look for a hill in the Shiba region where Kodama lurk, you should find the Sangaku Beads.<br></p><p>If you’d like a more explicit hint, here’s the exact location:<br></p><figure id="" data-id="e7e0dba6e666e52034b7037977a15e26" data-recommend-id="image://e7e0dba6e666e52034b7037977a15e26" data-format="jpg" data-width="2048" data-height="1152" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The map for the beads." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The map for the beads." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Atlus / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="e7e0dba6e666e52034b7037977a15e26" data-recommend-id="image://e7e0dba6e666e52034b7037977a15e26" data-format="jpg" data-width="2048" data-height="1152" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The map for the beads." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>It’s to the left of the <strong>Shiba </strong>Leyline, so you won’t need to travel too far to get there.

Nozuchi also has a lightning weakness, which your protagonist can exploit if you’re still using the Zio spell he started with. Nozuchi does resist physical attacks, so if you’re using any physical-focused party members, have them target the Kodamas.<br></p><p>If you just focus on exploiting weaknesses, you should come out on top. <strong>Just be careful that you aren’t using any party members that are weak to Force (Wind)</strong>, as the enemy party can exploit this hard and gain easy extra turns in the process. As a general rule of thumb, battles can go south <em>very </em>quickly in <em>Shin Megami Tensei </em>if you don’t mind your resistances.<br></p><figure id="" data-id="9190671b64fa35006415703fe069d522" data-recommend-id="image://9190671b64fa35006415703fe069d522" data-format="jpg" data-width="2048" data-height="1152" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Nozuchi expresses regret." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Nozuchi expresses regret." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Atlus / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="9190671b64fa35006415703fe069d522" data-recommend-id="image://9190671b64fa35006415703fe069d522" data-format="jpg" data-width="2048" data-height="1152" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Nozuchi expresses regret." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>After you resolve the battle, the Nozuchi will reflect on its ways and bring the Beastly Battle of Wits to an end for good.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/the-dual-protagonists-of-assassin-s-creed-shadows-enabled-the-series-jump-to-feudal-japan<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-module="content" data-testid="article-base-body-content"><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">One of the main hooks of the Assassin's Creed series is seeing an action-adventure game set in historical eras not often seen in game development. Whether exploring cathedrals and canals in Renaissance-era Venice or colonial cities in North America during the 18th century, Ubisoft's flagship franchise has been creative with recontextualizing history. But when it comes to making an entry set in an era often explored for games, the next Assassin's Creed aims to approach it from different angles to showcase its next setting and protagonists in a new light.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">With </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Assassin's Creed Shadows</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, developer Ubisoft Quebec leans into the studio's prior experience on </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>AC Syndicate</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Odyssey</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> to make a game with dual protagonists who can engage with the setting and its characters very differently. Focusing on the story of the African foreigner turned samurai Yasuke and the female shinobi Naoe coming into her own, they each offer a unique perspective on contending with wartime Feudal Japan.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">At the Ubisoft Forward 2024 showcase,&nbsp; we spoke with associate game director Simon Lemay-Comtois about how the developers leaned further into building an open world around two protagonists that are polar opposites of one another.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Ubisoft Quebec has worked with dual protagonists before">Ubisoft Quebec has worked with dual protagonists before</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">According to Lemay-Comtois, realizing the long-requested Feudal-era Japan setting was about "pushing forward with that shinobi fantasy," which aligns with the series' focus on elusive assassins in historical settings. Yet, with </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Assassin's Creed Shadows</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, it was imperative for the dev team to not only make an AC game with ninjas and samurai, but to deliver a well-rounded experience that centred the very different perspectives of two unique protagonists.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Syndicate</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> was our first time helming a core AC game, and at the time, we were very ambitious with what we wanted to do," said Lemay-Comtois. "But of course, we were young and didn't go all in as we could have with that game. Now that we're a more mature studio with experience handling games like this, we trust ourselves with AC and push much further with the contrast between the dual protagonists and their experiences. One is an African male and a foreigner in a new land, and the other is a Japanese female trying to find her place during an era where women had a very different experience. So we're leaning into these real cultural tenets, pushing as far as we can in ways we couldn't on </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Syndicate</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">."</span></p><p>Image via Ubisoft.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span> Assassin's Creed Shadows</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, the story takes place during the end of the Sengoku period in the 16th century, with Yasuke and Naoe–both outsiders in their own ways–joining forces to navigate the complex hierarchies of power during a civil war in Japan. There are, of course, larger and more sinister forces to contend with that lean into AC's blend of historical fiction and sci-fi fantasy. Much like Ubisoft Quebec's work on </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Syndicate</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, the twin protagonist approach offers two contrasting narratives that comprise a larger whole and showcase parallel gameplay styles–with Yasuke focusing on combat and fighting in the open, and Naoe relying on stealth action that has some influence from Splinter Cell's light-and-shadow gameplay.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In many ways, each character and their respective gameplay styles reflect the two core pillars of the AC series: combat and stealth. While </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Shadows</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> still retains AC's recent trend towards RPG mechanics like leveling up and earning gear, the core combat and stealth focuses more on the action and timing-oriented gameplay from earlier games. Players can choose which characters to take on specific missions and leverage their individual playstyle to overcome obstacles (and do murder) in unique ways. It's a notable change given how combat-heavy recent games in the series have become.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Our demo saw the same mission being played with each character, offering a glimpse at how choosing either Yasuke or Naoe will fundamentally alter the flow and dynamics of missions. In one pivotal moment in Yasuke's mission, he tore through the walls of the lord's sanctum to access his target. Naoe, by contrast, carefully grappled onto roofs and crawled prone-style through a pond out of sight to land a stealth kill. That duality makes for a refreshing change of pace for the franchise.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Making feudal Japan stand out as a setting">Making feudal Japan stand out as a setting</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">While Ancient Japan and the mythology of the samurai and ninja have been common conceits within games like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Ghost of Tsushima</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, the developers of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> wanted to take an opportunity to shine a particular spotlight on details and figures not often represented from the era.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Lemay-Comtois says the historical figure of Yasuke and how he navigated Japanese society during the era was something the dev team stumbled upon during their research. This not only helped them gain a greater understanding of how to best reflect Japan's history and culture through the lens of Assasin’s Creed, it also made the developers acknowledge their own outsider's perspective while pursuing a sense of authenticity for the setting.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"One of the opportunities it gave us was to be humble about the culture of Japan, because it's not ours–we're a Canadian studio leading this game, so we know we're not of Japan, and we certainly don't want to tell Japanese audiences what their culture is all about," said Lemay-Comtois. "We want to respect the setting and era and put it forward for AC, and having Yasuke as one of the main characters with an outsider's point of view was a way for us to have some creative leeway in crafting this story from different angles. But also having Naoe as the other protagonist, who is Japanese-born and of the culture, allowed us to have that needed counterbalance for the Japanese perspective to bring it all together."</span></p><p>Image via Ubisoft.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Unfortunately, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> has drawn the ire of certain online communities, which have expressed outrage at the choice of a Black protagonist in a Japanese setting. Lemay-Comtois said he and his team weren't fazed by the racist backlash, and that picking two underrepresented protagonists from Japanese history was in the spirit of the game.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">So far,</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span> Shadows </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">is taking an intelligent approach to building one of the series' most requested settings, while also seizing the opportunity to resolve a recurring issue that has seen modern Assassin's Creed gameplay become inconsistent with combat and stealth. Protagonists Yasuke and Naoe offer unique ways to content with and navigate the rich setting, and make for compelling additions to the long-running series.</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author(s)</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Contributor</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Alessandro Fillari is a writer/editor who has covered the games, tech, and entertainment industries for more than 12 years.

<p data-characters="305" data-injectable="true" data-video="true"><em>Metal Slug Tactics</em> has been parked on the horizon for what feels like an eternity. First announced <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/metal-slug-tactics-reveal-summer-game-fest/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">back in 2021</a>, it’s perhaps due to my excitement that a few years have felt like an age. It’s almost here, however, and I’ve had the opportunity to try it out and see if all the suffering was worth it.</p> <p data-characters="366" data-current-count="366" data-injectable="false">If you aren’t familiar, <em>Metal Slug Tactics</em> is a spin-off of the venerable 1996 arcade classic. As the name implies, Leikir has transplanted the run-and-gun gameplay to the grid-like fields of a turn-based strategy game. And while those two genres are vastly different, there is very little in this world that can’t be improved with the presence of Fiolina Germi.</p> <figure data-current-count="666" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="426" data-current-count="426" data-injectable="true">The narrative of <em>Metal Slug Tactics</em> is hardly surprising. Mainstay antagonist, General Morden, has escaped and is… bad. The demo doesn’t really suggest any subtext. You play as the good guys, and the rebels are the bad guys. Blow them up. It’s actually kind of annoying how little the dialogue tries to show personality. Leikir’s maybe afraid of straying too far from the source material, but the result is just empty.</p>
 <p data-characters="174" data-current-count="174" data-injectable="false">That’s not terribly important, considering you’ll spend most of your time viewing a battlefield grid. However, I have more bad news for (some of) you: It’s a roguelite.</p> <p data-characters="233" data-current-count="407" data-injectable="true">You select your three characters in the garage, and then they speed out to a selected region. You’re then set loose to complete a set number of missions before the boss shows up. If you can defeat the boss, you complete the region.</p>
 <p data-characters="293" data-current-count="293" data-injectable="false">In between missions, you’re provided with random perks and equipment, which are only available for that run. Likewise, your characters level up, but once the run is complete, they’re back to square one. Permanent progress is made by buying upgrades for the perks you’re given as options.</p> <figure data-current-count="593" data-injectable="true"><p> <iframe title="Metal Slug Tactics - New trailer | Coming Fall 2024" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kjQ5hyo-Jkk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure>
 <p data-characters="347" data-current-count="347" data-injectable="false">The framework doesn’t bother me. The luck required to have the best perks show up between missions is the major reservation here, but the roguelite injection at least means that the battles depend more on skill than simply leveling up your characters. Your success is based mostly on how deftly you can cut through missions to get their rewards.</p> <p data-characters="179" data-current-count="526" data-injectable="true">And there is a deceptively high skill ceiling. Characters use their skills by spending adrenaline, and adrenaline is built up by traveling to the extremes of their movement range.</p>
 <p data-characters="363" data-current-count="363" data-injectable="false">Beyond that, however, unit placement is important to utilize sync attacks. Essentially, if one of your characters attacks while that enemy is in another unit’s sights, the stationary unit will add to the attack. If you’re careful and need to take down a particularly hefty enemy, you can position three characters so they’ll each join in for one big attack.</p> <p data-characters="240" data-current-count="603" data-injectable="true">There’s no requirement to follow the turn order, either. Sometimes, a character will get a bonus move for performing an action, which allows you to reposition them. If you take advantage of this, they can act in two separate sync attacks.</p>
 <p data-characters="233" data-current-count="233" data-injectable="false">The importance of placement in <em>Metal Slug Tactics</em> means that things keep moving and rarely slow down. There isn’t a lot of importance placed on sync attacks at the beginning, either, so it can make the game feel deceptively simple.</p> <figure data-current-count="533" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="193" data-current-count="193" data-injectable="false">There’s a variety of missions that pop up which range from escort missions to enemy extermination. Each one has a sub-objective which will net you additional bonuses if you can pull them off.</p> <p data-characters="208" data-current-count="401" data-injectable="true">The boss battles are a bit more interesting. The demo only has a single one against Big Shiee, the Yamato-style battleship on treads. I was delighted since it’s also my favorite boss from across the series.</p>
 <p data-characters="489" data-current-count="489" data-injectable="true">The battle is interesting since your soldiers leap across floating cargo containers. Every couple turns, a section of ground will drop into the water, killing anyone atop them. You have to attack Big Shiee in the middle, but you can’t simply ignore the soldiers who pop up with every new clump of junk. This means you have to keep moving and take your shots on the big ship whenever you have an opening. It’s pretty enjoyable, though there seems to be some effects missing in the demo.</p>
 <p data-characters="413" data-current-count="413" data-injectable="true">Speaking of which, the visuals are nice but not exactly up to the legendary standards of the original series. It’s pretty difficult to live up to Nazca’s pixel art, but it’s not bad. My biggest issue with the visuals is the menus and HUD, which don’t share the pixelated art of the gameplay. Any high-resolution text next to a pixel art backdrop is going to look awful. They might as well use Comics Sans.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="311" data-current-count="611" data-injectable="true">After some hesitation, I eventually began enjoying my time with <em>Metal Slug Tactics</em>. It’s a deceptively simple strategy game, not unlike something such as <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-chroma-squad/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Chroma Squad</a></em>. Its link with the <em>Metal Slug </em>series feels largely cosmetic, but Leikir is making the most of it by incorporating familiar bosses and enemies.</p>
 <p data-characters="353" data-current-count="353" data-injectable="false">I’m not blown away, but I am looking forward to when the full version arrives this Fall. I’d like to see greater enemy variety, most of all. Tanks were mentioned in the demo, but aside from the eponymous Metal Slug, there were none to be seen. Here’s hoping that this small slice of <em>Metal Slug Tactics</em> is just the foundation for something special.</p> <p data-characters="64" data-current-count="417" data-injectable="false"><em>Metal Slug Tactics</em> is releasing on PC and consoles in Fall 2024.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dragon-age-creator-veilguard-romance<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Dragon Age&nbsp;</em>creator David Gaider has weighed in on the romance system that will be featured in the forthcoming&nbsp;<em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</em>, and it sounds like he's not a fan of the way the game will handle relationships.</p>
<p>A few days ago, in <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-age-the-veilguard-confirmed-to-let-you-romance-any-companion-you-want-will-include-nudity-it-gets-pretty-spicy" rel="noopener" target="_blank">an interview with IGN</a>,&nbsp;<em>The Veilguard&nbsp;</em>director Corinne Busche confirmed that it will be possible to romance any companion you like in&nbsp;<em>The Veilguard</em>, in a manner similar to&nbsp;<em>Baldur's Gate 3&nbsp;</em>(with <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/features/who-are-minsc-and-jaheira-baldurs-gate-3">two notable exceptions</a> in that case).</p>
<p>Now,&nbsp;<em>Dragon Age: Origins&nbsp;</em>writer and series creator David Gaider has given his thoughts on&nbsp;<em>The Veilguard</em>'s romance system, and he's less than pleased with it due to how he feels it limits character development.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dragon-age-the-veilguard-david-gaider-companions.jpg?itok=YZLWhh1s 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dragon-age-the-veilguard-david-gaider-companions.jpg?itok=yMN8H9ZC 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>You'll be able to romance any of your companions in&nbsp;<em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>In a <a href="https://x.com/davidgaider/status/1801421129502118278" rel="noopener" target="_blank">rather refreshingly even-handed thread</a> on X (formerly Twitter), Gaider says that he understands some&nbsp;<em>Dragon Age&nbsp;</em>fans will just want to romance "whoever they want", and that not getting to do so is "tantamount to a slap in the face".</p>
<p>Despite that, he says that making characters romanceable "limits the type of character they can be" insofar as they'll always need to be "appealing" to the player, which restricts the writing team to only being able to tell certain types of stories.</p>
<p>Gaider says this is the reason Varric wasn't romanceable in&nbsp;<em>Dragon Age: Inquisition</em>; making him a romance option would have "destroy[ed] his character", according to Gaider.</p>
<p>Making any character romanceable by any player character destroys their "agencies", according to Gaider, transforming them into "sex dolls" rather than fully-rounded people with their own stories to tell.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dragon-age-2-david-gaider-the-veilguard.jpg?itok=o1Iaj5SD 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dragon-age-2-david-gaider-the-veilguard.jpg?itok=NeftYlib 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Some of&nbsp;<em>Dragon Age 2</em>'s cast were pansexual, but not all of them were romanceable.</figcaption></figure><p>Gaider does, however, admit that his opinion is a "personal (and uncharitable) preference", going on to say that if&nbsp;<em>The Veilguard</em>'s writers "unapologetically lean into" romanceable characters, it "should be fine".</p>
<p>He does also have some thoughts about&nbsp;<em>Baldur's Gate 3</em>'s romanceable companions, though, saying that several of the game's characters "would have had a stronger arc" if they couldn't be romanced.</p>
<p>We'll have to wait and see whether Gaider's worries come to pass in&nbsp;<em>The Veilguard</em>, but if you want to get a sense for how the game plays on a moment-to-moment level, you can check out our <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/dragon-age-veilguard-preview-epic-fantasy-action">hands-off preview right here</a>.</p>

            <p>
Square Enix has released a launch trailer for Final Fantasy 14: Dawntrail, giving a new look at the MMORPG expansion's story.
</p>
<p>
Until now, we've only been given details of the story at the Fan Fest events from director and producer Naoki Yoshida, along with a CGI trailer of the expansion's new setting and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-14-dawntrails-adorable-new-job-revealed">Jobs</a>.
</p>
<p>
This launch trailer provides an in-game look at what players can expect from the world of Tural: from stormy seas, to cyberpunk cities. Check it out below.

<p>

As previously reported, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-14-dawntrail-everything-we-know-so-far">Dawntrail</a> takes place in the western continent of Tural known as the New World. The Scions and the player's Warrior of Light will take part in a contest for the Tural throne to become the next Dawn Servant.
</p>
<p>
In the new trailer, we see the Scions sailing off on a ship across stormy seas joined by new character and female Hrothgar Wuk Lamat.
</p>
<p>
From there the trailer hints at various story threads, so spoiler warning if you're looking to go in with zero knowledge. Though honestly, it brings up more questions than answers. Who, for instance, is the mysterious woman at the very end?
</p>
<p>
What's more, with this being in-game footage, it gives a strong look at the new graphical update that's coming with Dawntrail and the 7.0 series of patches.
</p>
<p>
We see boss battles, dungeons, futuristic cities, new characters, and more. In short, it looks spectacular.
</p>
<p>During a Letter from the Producer Live today, further details on the game were provided. Perhaps the most useful addition is the ability to hide player characters around a quest giver, something which should be helpful during peak times of play - the expansion's launch in particular.</p> <div>

I recently went <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dawntrail-is-final-fantasy-14-at-its-most-colourful">hands-on with a preview of Dawntrail</a> and described it as Final Fantasy 14 at its most colourful, thanks not only to the graphical update, but the new Pictomancer Job and the holiday setting.
</p>
<p>
Yoshida also told me there's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/almost-no-chance-of-final-fantasy-14-dawntrail-launch-server-woes-naoki-yoshida-says-after-endwalker-issues">"almost no chance" of server woes for the Dawntrail launch</a>, after major issues with previous expansion Endwalker.

I’ve always asserted that <em>Inquisition </em>has one of BioWare’s best stories and casts, but they’re buried under a lot of open-world nonsense and real-world time-gated mechanics that make it impossible to see everything in a timely manner. The “Story Mode” mods target several of the most time-consuming parts of <em>Inquisition</em>, from the War Table that requires you to wait in real-time (from a few minutes to several hours) to complete quests to the “Power” mechanic that gates the main story quests by making you do side quests to increase your influence.</p><p>I haven’t replayed <em>Dragon Age: Inquisition </em>in several years at this point, but playing it the first time, I knew its biggest weakness is how much all the superfluous live-service-esque nonsense gets in the way of enjoying its excellent critical path. Speedrunning that game is a needlessly complicated process, but these mods target a lot of pain points.

And if you’re new to the series, I’d recommend playing through the other games, too, and specific DLCs for each.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/why-metal-gear-solid-3-is-the-best-prequel-ever-made<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p><strong>Warning: This article contains spoilers for Metal Gear Solid 3 and Metal Gear Solid 4.</strong></p><p>It’s been a long time coming but Metal Gear fans finally have something concrete to look forward to. Although series creator Hideo Kojima has moved on to other projects, his long-beloved stealth action franchise is making a grand return to the forefront of gaming with <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/metal-gear-solid-3-remake-gameplay-trailer-xbox-games-showcase"><u>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</u></a>. Now that we have our first look at Delta’s gameplay from the <a href="https://www.ign.com/videos/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-trailer-xbox-showcase-2024"><u>new trailer</u></a> shown at the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-games-showcase-and-black-ops-6-direct-june-2024-everything-announced"><u>Xbox Games Showcase</u></a>, we’re even more excited to get our hands on it. But for now, we want to take a look back at the original Metal Gear Solid 3, which will celebrate its 20th anniversary this year on November 17th, 2004.</p><p>Specifically, we’re going to talk about how MGS3 tells a more vital prequel narrative than most other franchises can match. What was at the time seen as a course correction from Metal Gear Solid 2’s lack of Solid Snake playtime and perhaps even a delaying action of paying off 2’s narrative threads to the eventual Metal Gear Solid 4, the benefit of hindsight has shown that MGS3 is a critical installment in the series’ mythology. Sure, it received <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/metal-gear-solid-3-snake-eater/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>great reviews</u></a> on release, but why does the story not really work if you just played MGS1, 2 and 4 as a trilogy when they happen in chronological order? Let’s take a look at what makes MGS3 so essential.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h2>A New Mission</h2><p>After two games set in a “few years in the future” sci-fi setting, Kojima went in an entirely new direction with Metal Gear Solid 3. The mechanics and systems he used to create such iconic stealth action gameplay in MGS1 and 2 could have been iterated on to even greater success, but 3 made the bold leap of developing new ways to engage with the genre. From the camo index system where players had to adjust their disguise to match their surroundings, needing to hunt for food in the wild to keep up stamina, curing serious injuries in the field, and depriving players of many of the futuristic gadgets that were so helpful in previous games, MGS3 forced fans to rethink their strategies as they explored the Soviet jungle in pursuit of objectives.</p><p>The mission took players through a variety of exotic locations and exciting sequences, with the Shagohod chase in particular being one of the best action set pieces on the PlayStation 2. Yet if the Metal Gear franchise is known for anything gameplay wise besides stealth, it’s a penchant for creative boss fights against bizarre villains, and MGS3 has one of the best rogue’s galleries in the franchise. The Cobra Unit were incredibly expressive both in visual design and how they let the ways they fought give players an insight into their personalities instead of each one telling an elaborate backstory as they died. The bosses interacted with the new gameplay systems, such being able to use camo to hide from The Fury, or tricky players giving The Fear food poisoning using rotten food to quickly drain his stamina. The crown jewel of the Cobra fights was The End, which used a massive environment and all the game’s stealth mechanics to create a proper sniper’s duel that for some players went on for over an hour.</p><p>Kojima’s talent for merging story and gameplay reaches its peak in the game’s final encounter: the battle between Snake and The Boss. With only 10 minutes before the arena is bombed to smithereens, all of the skills players developed over the course of the journey, especially in regards to sneaking and CQC, are tested as they try to defeat Snake’s old mentor. The white flowers and trees of the arena matching The Boss’ outfit, the slow build up of the Snake Eater theme song as the timer winds down, and forcing the player to push the button to deliver the final shot during what appears to be a cutscene all coalesce to form one of the most artistically resonant final battles in game history. The design template Kojima used in previous games is expanded and refined into its purest form in MGS3, making the game a fitting prequel not just in story, but also in gameplay.</p><h2>In Love and (Cold) War</h2><p>Set in 1964, Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater is, at first glance, a back to basics take on the Metal Gear series. Snake is back in the lead role, albeit technically not the same one as previous games, with the protagonist instead being the <em>original</em> Snake, aka Big Boss, whose DNA was used to create the clones Solid, Liquid and Solidus. The setup is essentially classic MGS action but in the jungle, and with a 007-style spy thriller/romance angle added on top. The complicated philosophical concepts and labyrinthine bad guy plans from MGS2 are dropped for a more straightforward Cold War story about Snake trying to stop a nuclear war from breaking out, while also dealing with his relationships with his apparently traitorous mentor, The Boss, and his budding maybe-maybe-not romance with his spy companion EVA.</p><p>What some likely took as an artistic retreat from Kojima into less controversial territory has instead revealed itself over the years to be a conscious addition of key emotional context to what had become a sprawling multi-decade saga. Trying to connect all the various threads of MGS lore and the political machinations of dozens of characters and factions can be a dizzying prospect, but MGS3 cuts through the chaff and reminds the audience that these are stories not just about nations and lofty ideas but about characters, ones who MGS3’s script mines for a surprising amount of depth. At the center of it all is Snake, a man and soldier still holding onto the last of his ideals, only to lose all of it as he “succeeds” in the mission that would break both him and his hope in his country.</p><p>His battles with The Boss, who is revealed to not be a traitor but instead a patriot allowing her reputation to be destroyed in order to preserve world peace, shatter Snake’s faith in everything he’d ever been led to believe in. Meanwhile, his romance with EVA turning out to be a ruse to pilfer him of the Philosopher’s Legacy ruins his ability to put trust in anyone besides his fellow soldiers. These two relationships crumbling not only gives an answer as to why he eventually becomes Big Boss, the villain of the original two Metal Gear games on the MSX2, but also establishes that the recurring theme of soldiers being betrayed by their governments and wanting to build nations of their own that had been one of the central running motifs of the series, has a foundation that goes beyond the conflict fans were already familiar with. Even before Solid Snake was born, this was just a fact of this world, and cementing that world is what makes MGS3 so crucial to its immediate successor.</p><h2>A Solid Circle</h2><p>Besides telling its own story, MGS3 also adds important definition to the world of Metal Gear that helps solidify (hah) the plot threads that MGS4 would conclude. Sure, in timeline order, MGS4 is technically a sequel to MGS2. But when looking at the actual meat of plot and world-building, MGS3 is the game that most informs MGS4. We’re talking about more than basic stuff like learning about the Shagohod, which was the genesis from which Metal Gear technology would later develop, or introducing the character of Big Boss to series fans who never played the original two MSX games (which, let’s be honest, is most of them). MGS4 only works as an ending to the saga because of how it builds off of MGS3’s themes and characters.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Nothing that happens in MGS3 is a “bonus”; it is the beating heart of a saga Kojima had been telling across numerous games since 1987</p></div><p>The idea that the conflicts between soldiers and their governments that led Big Boss and other Metal Gear villains into wanting to establish some version of Outer Heaven are cyclical across history only sells if we’ve actually seen that conflict, well, <em>across</em> history. The reveal that EVA is the one who gave birth to Solid and Liquid and truly did love Big Boss despite her betrayal would come out of nowhere without us becoming invested in her in MGS3. And without getting to know them when they were young and charismatic, the twist that the Patriots, the ultimate villains of the entire Metal Gear saga, were in fact the mission support team who helped the original Snake (and by extension, the player) in the 1960s wouldn’t register as such a tragic gut-punch.</p><p>Sure, there are worthwhile prequels that fill in lore gaps or recontextualize aspects of plot or character: Rogue One, Andor, Better Call Saul, House of the Dragon, and Furiosa to name a recent few. But what makes MGS3 stand out from the pack is that in most other cases, later stories in the timeline work perfectly well on their own without the prequel material. Metal Gear stories set after MGS3, such as MGS4, MGS5 or Peace Walker, don’t really function dramatically without knowing the story from MGS3. Nothing that happens in MGS3 is a “bonus”; it is the beating heart of a saga Kojima had been telling across numerous games since 1987. It is the connective tissue that brings the original MSX games, the early Solid series, and the final entries together into a single whole. That it’s also an excellent title on its own terms, full of some of the series’ most exciting action set pieces and strongest character work, only further cements its status as the greatest prequel ever made.</p><p><em>Carlos Morales writes novels, articles and Mass Effect essays.

This sounds perfect for any big fans or collectors out there, so there's no like the present to get your order in. Plus, we likely won't see a better deal than this before the release on June 21.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>In case you slept on this game when it first came out, we liked it rather a lot. In <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-review">our review</a>, the first ever 10 we've given a FromSoftware game, we said: "Throughout it all, while the fundamentals of combat haven’t changed much from what we’ve seen before, the enormous variety of viciously designed enemies and the brutal but surmountable bosses have brought its battles to a new level. Even with all the threads I didn’t manage to tug on my first playthrough (of what I’m sure will be several), what I was treated to can easily be held amongst the best open-world games I’ve ever played." </p><p>It was also recently announced that <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-reaches-25-million-units-sold-ahead-of-shadow-of-the-erdtree">Elden Ring has sold 25 million units ahead of Shadow of the Erdtree</a>. In a post on X/Twitter, the colossal 25 million units sold milestone was revealed alongside a thank you to fans who have purchased the game. Elden Ring publisher Bandai Namco announced <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-sales-swell-to-an-incredible-23-million">the game crossed 23 million units sold in March 2024</a>, meaning it's grown another two million in less than three months.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gamesindustry.biz/there-was-no-e3-but-microsoft-won-it-anyway-opinion<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        

        <p>Just by treating the summer showcase events as a serious competitive opportunity, Xbox has come away with its best public image boost in years</p>

    </div><div>



            <p>There is at least one long-standing E3 tradition that has now outlived E3 itself: the picking of winners and losers from the event.</p>
<p>This is a distributed, largely subjective process of judgment and evaluation which has on some occasions been quite spurious and misguided, but at other times has genuinely set the tone for the competitive landscape of the year to come. Whatever failings ultimately sank E3 – and there were many, many failings – the show's position on the calendar was no accident. It remains perfectly balanced right at the point when companies have locked down their holiday release schedules and are ready to start looking forward to the following year's tentpole titles; with or without a trade show to anchor it, the start of June is always going to be a milestone games companies are focused on.</p>
<p>Consequently, it's always going to be an opportunity to take the pulse and temperature of the industry's market leaders – if not to declare outright winners and losers, then at least to get a sense of where we're going in the next 12 to 18 months.</p>
<p>All of this musing is not really required this year, I suppose, because this is one of those rare years in which there's an obvious winner: Microsoft.</p>
<p>Microsoft 'won' whatever this echoed remnant of E3 is, and it wasn't even close. You can measure that by just about any metric you fancy, if you want to get all quantitative about it; the games Microsoft announced and showed off garnered the most attention and acclaim no matter what yardstick you choose to use. Perhaps for the first time since the Xbox 360 generation, Microsoft is walking away from (the ghost of) E3 with a forward software pipeline that's very clearly head and shoulders ahead of its rivals' offerings thus far – an incredibly important shot in the arm not only for public perception of Xbox (which has been having a tough time in the past year) but also, no doubt, for confidence within the company itself.</p>
<p>The caveat – and it's a big one – is that one other thing that was very clear over the past week is that there are a bunch of different visions for what Not-E3 is and what role it should play, and there was a strong sense that Sony had prepared a set of announcements for a very different event to the one Microsoft envisioned.</p>
<p>That's Sony's mistake, if so; Microsoft came to the table with an incredibly solid presentation that stacked high-profile, fan-favourite titles one after the other in a way that would easily have ranked as a top-notch E3 event back when E3 still existed. Sony's more meagre offering felt like a pretty standard announcement livestream shoehorned into a fortnight of larger events, and it's fairly likely that that's what it was (and quite likely that Nintendo's Direct event in the coming days will be similarly low-key).</p>
<blockquote><p>One good event won't fully turn around public perception dented by studio closures and ill-considered statements, but it finally feels like Xbox is ready to offer genuine competition to PlayStation</p></blockquote>
<p>This creates a visibility problem; we know that Microsoft took the Not-E3 opportunity very seriously and has shown us a pretty significant chunk of what it's got in the pipeline (which is great), but it's really not clear how much of Sony's upcoming software roadmap we've actually seen, and it's unlikely we'll get more than a cursory glimpse of Nintendo's plans. The discord between these companies' visions of what the June showcase season means and what it's for is an echo of the wider discord that ultimately spelled the end of E3 itself, torn between too many competing visions of what the show could be and should do.</p>
<p>None of that detracts from Xbox finally getting to put on a genuinely fantastic show. On the strength of what we've seen so far, Xbox is the platform to beat in terms of software offerings for the next 12 to 18 months. This is the first time that it's really felt like Microsoft's incredibly expensive acquisition spree is paying full dividends; there's still a lot of work for the platform to do (one good event won't fully turn around public perception dented by studio closures and ill-considered statements), but it finally feels like Xbox is ready to offer genuine competition to PlayStation in ways that actually matter. The last time that was the case, we were all a hell of a lot younger. Then, too, the stars aligned in a similar way; Microsoft finding its feet as a software publisher just as Sony stumbled, falling victim, in many ways, to its own success.</p>
<p>Of course, it remains possible that Sony has far more to show, especially with regard to the 2025 pipeline – this year is already something of a write-off, the success of Helldivers 2 and the buckets of charm of Astro Bot notwithstanding.</p>

<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/xbox-june-2024-showcase-lineup.jpeg?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">
 </a>
<figcaption>Microsoft has an impressive line-up of titles due in the next 12 to 18 months</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>One of the consequences of this new, disjointed and disparate set of summer events is that there's no consensus on what you do and don't announce at Not-E3. Take hardware, for example; Microsoft mentioned some new SKUs of its consoles, but Sony didn't whisper a word about the spec-bumped Pro model we know is coming later this year, and we <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/nintendo-breaks-silence-on-switch-2-promises-announcement-by-april-2025">already know that we won't see anything about the Switch successor</a> in Nintendo's Direct event next week.</p>
<p>In E3's heyday, these new hardware reveals would have been a given (at least for Sony; Nintendo has always been unpredictable in this regard, doing weird things like revealing new devices at the Tokyo Game Show, despite not even having a booth at the show itself).</p>
<p>The lack of any mention of new hardware, then, makes you wonder what other editorial choices were being made. Sony chose to lead on hero shooter Concord, which looks like a perfectly fine game but in retrospect was a poor choice for showcase flagship, given the tough contrasts with Microsoft's hit-after-hit approach, announcing a ton of major titles one after the other. Microsoft even dodged the bullet I was already flinching in anticipation of, namely turning at least one of those huge announcements sour by making the game live service.</p>
<p>The assumption most consumers who followed the showcases (which is a lot of people – the cumulative views on the various versions of these events uploaded to YouTube are immense) will come away with is that Sony's big franchise updates and new titles from its most valued studios are still too early in development to show off, which could speak to a very quiet 2025 release schedule – not a great look for the market leader – but this could just be an editorial decision.</p>
<blockquote><p>This is no Giant Enemy Crab moment, but it's very rare to see PlayStation look so weak in terms of its pipeline</p></blockquote>
<p>Maybe there's a plan to announce a bunch of upcoming games alongside the PS5 Pro reveal at an event later in the year. Gamescom in late August and TGS in September are both well-timed options for something like that; equally, the online nature of modern showcases and announcements means Sony could just throw a dart at a calendar and pick a date that suits it, which was never really an option until relatively recently.</p>
<p>All of this speaks to very divergent visions of what Not-E3, or some eventual E3 replacement, should be from the three platform holders who matter most – and it's worth noting that some other very important platform holders, like Apple and Google, weren't really there at all; it remains a little unfathomable to me that with the exception of a brief nod at Apple's WWDC event, the mobile platform holders don't try to elbow into this space with game showcases of their own.</p>
<p>Yet at the same time, there's no denying that the past two weeks have had a little of the old E3 magic, at least viewed from where I sit all the way over on another continent, in a very inconvenient timezone. The appetite from consumers for these showcase events is very clear, and many publishers seem to have really decided to focus on this as an opportunity for major announcements in a way that's been absent for quite a few years. The value of this point on the calendar as an opportunity to bring a ton of eyeballs to the games that the industry is teeing up for the rest of the year and beyond has not faded – but the biggest market players of all are taking very, very different approaches to what that means.</p>
<p>It will be very interesting to see how this year's event shapes the evolution of companies' attitudes into next year. Sony is far out in front as market leader, but it would nonetheless be foolish not to feel at least a little bit shaken by the stark difference in the public reception to its event and to Microsoft's event. That really should spur something of a re-examination of its strategy towards this showcase season.</p>
<p>It's not the worst slip-up – this is no Giant Enemy Crab moment, by any means – but it's been very rare in recent years to see PlayStation look so weak in terms of its forward pipeline by comparison with its rivals. Sony should be very wary of letting that perception last long, or worse, letting it be reinforced by future events. No matter how far in front PlayStation may be right now, it's still up against a fiercely competitive rival with nearly $100bn of studios and publishers in its back pocket, and Sony cannot assume that it will get to set the rules and the pacing for public announcements and showcases in future.</p>
<p>The summer showcase season should be a competition, and every major company should be bringing their A game; perhaps it's precisely in that rekindled spirit of industry competition that we might, in time, find a coherent form for a true successor event to E3.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gamesindustry.biz/astro-bot-beats-doom-as-the-no1-wishlisted-game-of-the-summer-games-showcases<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        

        <p>IGN Playlist data reveals the purchase intent of gamers from the last two weeks</p>

    </div><div>



            <p>Astro Bot is the winner of the summer games showcases (so far), with the most wishlists of all the games shown and announced over the past two weeks.</p>
<p>The data comes from IGN Playlist, which is a backlog and play activity tracker that is available on the web and via a mobile app.</p>
<p>The chart below is based on the purchase intent of over 43,000 gamers, and factors in new wishlists from May 30 (the day of the PlayStation State of Play conference) to June 12.</p>
<p>The interest in Astro Bot may come as a bit of a surprise. After all, Sony stated earlier in the year that it didn't plan to release any major new titles based on existing IP this year, and this game is due September 6. Therefore, it's likely even PlayStation had modest expectations for the game.</p>
<p>But Astro Bot is the successor to Astro's Playroom, an extended tech demo that was included with every PS5 sold (over 56 million units so far). As a result, Sony has exposed the Astro series to a very large audience already (including the crucial and lucrative early adopter audience), and we might just be seeing some of that audience returning for the sequel.</p>
<p>PlayStation may hold the top spot, but the rest of the Top Ten is dominated by games that featured in Xbox's showcase. The No.2 spot belongs to Doom: The Dark Ages by Bethesda, which opened Microsoft's show. The shooter is also coming to PS5 so has a larger addressable market than some of the other Xbox games in this list, such as Gears of War: E-Day at No.3, and Perfect Dark at No.4.</p>
<p>One thing worth noting about this chart is that it just counts people who wishlisted games <em>during</em> this two-week period. This naturally favours new games that were announced over the past two weeks, whereas games that were available to wishlist prior to this period (such as Assassin's Creed Shadows at No.5, Fable at No.8, and Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 at No.9), will already have had a base of interest that isn't factored in here.</p>
<p>The biggest new IP of the showcases was Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, which is an RPG from independent developer Sandfall Interactive and published by Kepler. The game just about comes ahead of another new IP in South of Midnight from Compulsion Games and Xbox, which received its first gameplay trailer last week.</p>
<p>Kepler has two games in the Top 25 most wishlisted titles, with Flintlock: The Siege of Dawn at No.21.</p>
<p>There were a few well received indie games that have made the Top 25, too. Mixtape from Beethoven and Dinosaur, and published by Annapurna, impressed during the Xbox showcase and that has translated to wishlists, coming in at No.15. Meanwhile, Neva, which was a much talked about game from Geoff Keighley's Summer Games Fest event, is at No.20.</p>
<p>Overall, although sequels dominate the Top Five, there's a decent number of new IP in this list, with nine original games overall.</p>
<p>This is ultimately just an early snapshot from the summer games showcases. Nintendo has yet to host its Direct video, and there will be plenty of media coverage to come from the games shown over the past two weeks. Therefore, we will look to provide a further update to this chart in the coming weeks.</p>
<p><em>GamesIndustry.biz</em>, which is now part of the IGN group of websites, will continue to publish IGN Playlist insight and data moving forward.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/avalon-hill-reveals-talisman-5th-edition-expansion-and-new-heroquest-beginner-set.901515/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/avalon-hill-reveals-talisman-5th-edition-expansion-and-new-heroquest-beginner-set<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Avalon Hill is a board game publisher known by many for the long-running games like <em>Talisman, HeroQuest, </em>or <em>Betrayal At House On The Hill</em>. While it was only recently that <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/talisman-fifth-edition-announced-by-games-workshop"><em>Talisman 5th Edition</em> was revealed </a>they aren't done with the announcements yet as they invited us to hear about their upcoming RPG slate. We got to hear from Patrick O'Rourke, Director of Product Management, Cait Drouin, Associate Manager of Product Management, and Doug Hopkins, Game Designer of <em>HeroQuest, Talisman</em>, and many other titles about what else to expect.</p>
<p>Starting off the session more information was given about some of the recently announced titles.</p>
<h3><em>Heroquest: Jungles of Delthrak</em></h3>
<p><em>Heroquest: Jungles of Delthrak</em> is a new expansion. Global Preorder launched May 31st, can be pre-ordered now, and will be available on August 1st.</p>

<p>Drouin explained that this expansion will take you to a jungle where a dwarven relic is the object of a number of factions eyes. Choose your own adventure with 16 brand new quests, new characters, and miniatures.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Hopkins explained that this will be before <em>Crypt of Perpetual Darkness,</em> but when it's being tested they do it with new characters so that any of the catch up mechanics are balanced. The idea is to keep it a sandbox feel but add more to that Sandbox.</p>
<p>DMs will have five new artifacts, new heroes, new monsters, new tiles. All to better fit the new jungle aesthetic. One of the Artifacts is the Sapphire Skull "This legendary relic is crafted from precious cobalt gemstone. It imbues you with poise and assurance. While wielding this artifact, roll 2 Attack dice against any one monster in your line of sight." This is meant to help the Wizard have a ranged attack.</p>
<p>Berserker and Explorer are adjacent to the Barbarian and Dwarf. These were made to compliment the older classes while creating characters with wholly new abilities. The Explorer will be responsible for finding treasures along the way while the Berserker can unlock different abilities as their health gets lower.</p>

<p>As well as hero minis there are also a wide variety of new monsters and tools. Minis included are dinosaurs, spiders, giant apes, as well as some old familiars. Enemies like the Cultist have also been updated to make them more versatile for any encounter.</p>
<p>Explaining the Choose Your Own adventure features they wanted to create an experience where players from different parties could share their own way they got through the story. You could end the quest book in a wholly different way that a friend does.</p>
<p>"This gives players more choice and agency over their own characters"</p>
<h3><em>Talisman: The Magical Quest Game - 5th Edition</em></h3>
<p>Announced at Cannes in Festival des Jeus in February. It's available for pre-order now and will be available in retail July 1st.</p>
<p>This version is going to be one that promotes player agency, this is not just to create a better experience for the players but also to make sure that players had a better control over how long the game will go.</p>
<p>The aim of the game is to collect the Crown of Command that's being protected by an elder dragon. There are a lot of new things added to the board including the ability to purchase a boat or find a cave to progress, things that cause players to lose turns have also been reduced. Those negative events also have a chance to be mitigated with rolls.</p>

<p>Hopkins wanted to make sure that as they've made a number of smaller choices the aim was to create a more streamlined experience that lets players get to the things that they want to do even faster. In playtesting Hopkins explained with five players new to one another it was 2 hours for them to play through <em>Talisman</em>, a stark difference from the 4 hours that a 4th Edition could last for.</p>
<p>If you're still after that 'classic' <em>Talisman </em>experience though the expanded rules will be available in the instruction manual in an alternate ruleset section.</p>
<p>A variety of the minis that will be included in <em>Talisman </em>were shown off. A troll with a spiked club and an elderly bearded wizard were highlighted as some particular favorites of those from the Avalon Hill team.</p>
<h2>New Announcements</h2>
<h3><em>Talisman Alliances</em></h3>
<p>As we moved into hearing about new products a trailer was shown for <em>Talisman 5e</em> as well as <em>Talisman Alliances</em>, an expansion coming in the near future. This expansion, which requires the base 5th edition box to play, is a new game mode that lets you play with others cooperatively.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Work together with your fellow players to overcome unique challenges called trials"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Players will need to share resources and fate to complete these five trials before they're able to complete the game.</p>
<p>Hopkins explained that there will be a number of closed off boxes that you open in sequence. You'll have to complete Trial 1 before you can open the box to Trial 2. It was clarified that this isn't meant to be like a legacy game, instead it's "just a way of rolling out the experience one Trial at a time."</p>

<p>To give a better idea of what these trials look like we were treated to the Introduction for Trial 1: Desperate Accord. A large part of the Trial is the Doom Tracker, this essentially puts the players on a race against the clock.</p>
<p>Hopkins explains that with this expansion they wanted to create a new way for new and old fans to interact with the world of <em>Talisman</em>. Pre-orders for <em>Talisman Alliances</em> is available today as of 10am EST and the expansion will be released October 1st.</p>
<p>While future <em>Talisman </em>expansions were teased it was something that we'll need to wait to hear about.</p>
<h3><em>HeroQuest First Light</em></h3>
<p>The last announcement was for <em>HeroQuest First Light</em>. This is a starter set that will let players get a taste of the <em>HeroQuest </em>system that might be hesitant to dive into the current available system whether it be that they're unsure if they'd like the game or if they don't want to get into it at that price point.</p>
<p>This is a place for a new party to begin, to learn the ropes, and get involved in the world. This set is happening at the same time as the current core set. Hopkins teased that for new <em>HeroQuest </em>fans you'll experience the excitement and betrayal of <em>HeroQuest </em>for the first time.</p>

<p>From here you should then be able to purchase expansions and continue to play the game forward.</p>
<p>This box is designed for one DM and four players, if there are less than four players then it can also mean a player might be taking on the roles of a few characters in the party.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/this-week-in-gaming-business-june-14th</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/this-week-in-gaming-business-2024-layoffs-already-higher-than-2023-total.901512/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/this-week-in-gaming-business-june-14th<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>It's about time for another look at the week in gaming business, and sadly, we've got some more grim numbers for you this week, with industry layoffs already surpassing last year's totals.</p>
<p>Several studios laid off employees or closed their doors for good this week, lending a rather moody coda to the summer gaming showcase season, and the week also featured some questionable comments by Xbox head Phil Spencer.</p>
<p>Here's our roundup of this week's biggest gaming business news.</p>
<h2>2024's industry layoffs have surpassed 2023's figures</h2>
<p>We start today with a rather sad and grim figure. According to <a href="https://publish.obsidian.md/vg-layoffs/Archive/2024" rel="noopener" target="_blank">this industry layoff tracker</a>, layoffs have reached a rough total of 10,800 this year, which means they've surpassed 2023's total already, despite the fact we've still got half of the year ahead of us.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/gaming-business-roundup-rollerdrome.jpg?itok=mtCuKtgM 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/gaming-business-roundup-rollerdrome.jpg?itok=KsDh9TRx 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>So many studios have been hit by layoffs or closures that it might be faster to list the ones that haven't.</figcaption></figure><p>In late May, 2024 industry layoffs <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/this-week-in-gaming-business-10k-layoffs">hit 10,000</a>, so there are just a few weeks between that unfortunate milestone and this one. In fact, the number is likely even higher than the tracker suggests, given that we don't have numbers for some of the companies listed.</p>
<p>Given these figures, the enthusiasm of the Summer Game Fest showcases feels misplaced, especially given that <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/every-xbox-showcase-2024-announcement">some of the companies</a> excitedly demonstrating new games were the very same ones hit by the worst layoffs.</p>
<h2>Several studios hit by layoffs</h2>
<p>Unfortunately, this week saw a wave of layoffs to add to the aforementioned counter, and some pretty big studios were affected, as well as some smaller outfits.</p>
<p><em>Final Fantasy Brave Exvius&nbsp;</em>developer Gumi announced that it plans to <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/layoffs-hit-japan-as-final-fantasy-brave-exvius-developer-asks-80-employees-to-voluntarily-resign/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">cut around 11% of its staff</a> this week, and Archiact, which has <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bossa-studios-and-archiact-hit-by-layoffs">already been a victim of the layoff wave</a> this year, said goodbye to further staff members as well.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/gaming-business-roundup-freediver-triton-down.jpg?itok=FF8dUp8v 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/gaming-business-roundup-freediver-triton-down.jpg?itok=F3Gl9R1u 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>VR studio Archiact is just one of several hit by layoffs this week.</figcaption></figure><p>Contract studio Lionbridge, which has worked with Activision and other studios, reportedly laid off 160 employees, and Polygon's Nicole Carpenter <a href="https://x.com/sweetpotatoes/status/1800501544770748595" rel="noopener" target="_blank">claimed</a> these layoffs occurred due to "union organizing and inquiring about working conditions".</p>
<p>Further layoffs occurred at Sumo Group, which <a href="https://www.sumogroupltd.com/news/2024/sumo-group-update/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">announced plans to cut "up to 15%" of its staff</a>&nbsp;and to <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/timbre-games_there-is-no-better-group-of-people-in-games-activity-7206724903322984448-GoPR" rel="noopener" target="_blank">close down subsidiary Timbre Games</a>. We also saw <a href="https://ask.vrchat.com/t/an-email-from-our-ceo/25060?ref=uploadvr.com" rel="noopener" target="_blank">layoffs of around 30%</a> at&nbsp;<em>VRChat</em>'s developer, which cites 2021-22 overhiring among its reasons for laying off employees.</p>
<p>Additionally,&nbsp;<em>Armello&nbsp;</em>studio League of Geeks <a href="https://leagueofgeeks.com/blog#gone-fishin" rel="noopener" target="_blank">made a decision to go "into hibernation" this week</a>, citing "the economic situation in games" at the moment. This layoff and closure train sadly just keeps rolling, it seems.</p>
<h2>Phil Spencer's questionable comments at IGN Live</h2>
<p>During the tail end of the IGN Live event, Xbox's Phil Spencer made some comments about the ongoing wave of industry layoffs, as well as his own <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/microsoft-arkane-austin-tango-gameworks-shutdown">shock decision to close Tango Gameworks, Arkane Austin, and two other studios last month</a>.</p>
<p>Speaking to Ryan McCaffrey, Spencer said that he "ha[s] to run a sustainable business inside the company and grow", and that this mandate requires him to make "hard decisions that frankly are not decisions I love".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/gaming-business-roundup-hi-fi-rush.jpg?itok=fqbMA5mC 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/gaming-business-roundup-hi-fi-rush.jpg?itok=nUN0OFek 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The subject of layoffs came up during this week's IGN Live, and Xbox head Phil Spencer certainly said some things.</figcaption></figure><p>Given that Microsoft <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/Investor/earnings/FY-2024-Q3/press-release-webcast" rel="noopener" target="_blank">isn't exactly doing badly right now in financial terms</a>&nbsp;and that Xbox has <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hi-fi-rush-was-break-out-hit-for-microsoft-according-to-aaron-greenberg">referred to Tango's&nbsp;<em>Hi-Fi Rush&nbsp;</em>as "a breakout hit"</a>, Spencer's comments seem mystifying, especially since he neglected to provide any kind of clarification regarding how exactly closing these studios would contribute to a "sustainable business".</p>
<p>It seemingly gets worse, though. During the aforementioned IGN Live event, the crowd cheered during Spencer's response to the question regarding studio closures, despite the fact that the question, and the response it demands, don't seem like a laughing matter.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://x.com/BrunoRo11530134/status/1800156864438792348" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a person who was apparently in the crowd</a> during that event, attendees were "told and pumped to cheer", with the loudest cheers getting prizes like <a href="https://x.com/BrunoRo11530134/status/1800641133598683466" rel="noopener" target="_blank">gaming headsets</a>.</p>
<p>If that's true, it seems at best like a shamefully inadequate response to a problem that's sweeping the industry, and at worst like trying to force audience members to cheerlead a company that has just caused hundreds of people to lose their livelihoods.</p>
<h2>In other news...</h2>
<p>We've just got time to take a look at a couple of other stories that happened on the business side of the industry this week, and they don't involve layoffs, thankfully.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/netflix-games-boss-mike-verdu-moving-on-to-new-role" rel="noopener" target="_blank">GamesIndustry.biz</a>, Netflix Games boss Mike Verdu is moving on to a new role within the company. We don't know what that role is, but GI.biz says it involves "innovation in game development". How mysterious.</p>
<p>Finally, Embracer Group announced this week that it has <a href="https://embracer.com/releases/embracer-group-closes-the-divestment-of-gearbox-entertainment/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">completed the divestment</a> of&nbsp;<em>Borderlands&nbsp;</em>developer Gearbox, which was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/grand-theft-auto-publisher-take-two-to-acquire-gearbox-from-embracer-new-borderlands-in">sold to&nbsp;<em>GTA&nbsp;</em>publisher Take-Two</a> back in March.&nbsp;</p>
<hr><p>That's all we've got for you on the industry side of things this week. Join us again next week when we'll take another look at what's been happening (and hopefully have a slightly less devastating layoff number to report).</p>

			<p>A couple of years ago, French developer Spiders <a href="https://wccftech.com/greedfall-2-announced-will-launch-next-year-on-pc-and-consoles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> GreedFall 2: The Dying World, the sequel to its solid 2019 roleplaying game. Back then, the studio was aiming for a 2024 launch window. Following a recent media presentation, we learned that the game will indeed debut this Summer, but only in early access. The full version will launch at some point in 205.</p>
<p>Contrary to that announcement, the studio has dropped the idea of making it a prequel. The game's events will instead run in parallel with the plot of the first title. What has not changed is that GreedFall 2: The Dying World will essentially keep the premise of the original by flipping the viewpoint: instead of journeying from Gacane to the island of Teer Fradee, you'll be doing the exact opposite (albeit not of your own volition) to explore the old continent. This still allows the studio to maintain the perspective of an outsider venturing into an unknown land.</p>
<p>The main character is a so-called Doneigad, a Sage, albeit a newly appointed one. While the build I've played did not allow for character customization, it will eventually be available later during the early access. The Doneigad's ultimate personal goal is, of course, to regain freedom, but a larger objective for the full game was teased by Spiders: stopping one man's crazed mission to bring destruction to the whole continent of Gacane.</p>
<p>In GreedFall 2: The Dying World, the protagonist will explore a variety of regions from Gacane, which is inspired by the European Baroque era. Players will encounter some of the factions from the first game, as well as a few new ones that weren't part of the Bridge Alliance expedition to Teer Fradee.</p>
<p>This is the first Spiders game to launch in early access. The studio provided several reasons for this choice, starting with the need to gather feedback from its fairly large community (the first game sold over two million copies). This ties in with the realization that the sequel is much bigger and, thus, will require more time to be fully polished. Furthermore, the studio is still working on improving the onboarding and combat system.</p>
<p>Players can expect around 30% of the full game to eventually make its way in the early access version, with more regions, companions, features, builds, and talents being released slowly through updates. Overall, the team aims for around 60 hours of playthrough for the full release.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/GreedFall2_Screenshot_07-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>GreedFall 2: The Dying World begins on Teer Fradee, with the main character still considered a 'Vriden Gerr' (Rootless) about to go through the initiation ritual to become a Doneigad. Members of the Bridge Alliance have already arrived on the island and some natives are already blaming them for poisoning the land. Among the most hostile toward the 'invaders' is Nilan, one of the companions, while the other companion, Sheda, appears to be a potential romantic interest for the main character.</p>
<p>It's important to note that the version I played was still incomplete compared to the one that's going to be released on early access. Some conversations had the voice-over entirely missing, while in other cases, it was 'just' the facial animations that had placeholders. With those caveats, it's hard to fully judge the game's presentation. Having said that, GreedFall 2: The Dying World certainly looks pretty good. It's still powered by the studio's own Silk Engine, but it is clear there have been significant improvements, especially for the lighting component. The game didn't run perfectly, but that was to be expected, given the early build. NVIDIA DLSS is already integrated on PC, though.</p>
<p>The biggest change I noticed while playing this sequel is undoubtedly its new combat system. Spiders has always made action RPGs, ever since the days of Bound by Flame, The Technomancer, and GreedFall itself. You could move in real time, parry, dodge out of the way, et cetera.</p>
<p>This time around, they're switching to a far more tactics-based system. Everything still plays out in real time, but you can pause at any moment to take control of a companion (also new in GreedFall 2: The Dying World) and set them to do whatever you wish. There's even a combat log that keeps track of everything that takes place on the battlefield. On one hand, this is nice for those who'd like to play strategically. However, this also means the action element is completely gone. In fact, the characters will auto-attack now unless you give them orders to do specific skills, essentially requiring players to micro-manage at all times, at least on high difficulty settings. You can queue up to three skills for each character in a single order.</p>
<p>Needless to say, the feeling is completely different and may not be to everyone's taste. It is interesting that the developers would change the combat this much despite the success of the first installment. It's equally worth noting that BioWare's Dragon Age (which is obviously a huge inspiration for Spiders) is pretty much going in the other direction. Whereas the first game in that series, Origins, had tab-target-like tactical combat, following entries have moved increasingly toward action combat, and The Veilguard even <a href="https://wccftech.com/dragon-age-dreadwolf-wont-let-you-control-party-members-directly-according-to-report/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">removed</a> the ability to directly control companions (though, to be fair, you will still be able to pause combat and issue specific orders to your companions via the new ability wheel, making it still more tactical than the first GreedFall).</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/GreedFall2_Screenshot_01-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>GreedFall 2: The Dying World, on the other hand, is transitioning from pure action to a slow tactics-based system. Needless to say, those Dragon Age fans who were yearning for a return to Origins will find respite here. As for me, I can't say I'm too excited about that particular change. However, I am very much looking forward to the new story in what I previously <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/greedfall-spiders-levelling-up/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">described</a> as one of the most unique fantasy settings created in recent games. There are also other additions, such as a new tracking vision mode that highlights environmental clues when scouring an area for information, and no doubt many more that I couldn't glean in the short two-hour hands-on.</p>
<p>I'll keep following the progress of GreedFall 2: The Dying World throughout early access and reporting back any significant content and feature updates. Stay tuned.</p>

But Hasbro’s Avalon Hill imprint has more than just retro vibes on its mind. The company has also revealed <em>Talisman: Alliances - Fate Beckons</em>, an expansion arriving alongside the revamped <a href="https://www.polygon.com/board-games">board game</a>. It will offer a cooperative mode of play for the first time in the franchise’s 41-year history.</p>
<p id="N1NYrV">“When we were thinking about 5th edition, we didn’t want to just reprint those old expansions and just recreate the existing content,” said strategic brand manager Patrick O’Rourke in a press briefing earlier this week. “We set out to explore ‘more.’ We wanted more game modes that could open the Talisman platform to more players and additional playstyles. And that’s why we created <em>Talisman: Alliances</em>.”</p>

<p id="NLrDWU">In a traditional game of <em>Talisman</em>, players take on the roles of adventurers in the style of fantasy role-playing games — classes such as fighter, wizard, cleric, and thief. They utilize special powers and abilities in their quest for a mighty MacGuffin called the Crown of Command. It’s a somewhat linear journey, and it often includes players fighting against one another. <em>Alliances</em> will upend that tradition by presenting players with a series of Trials that must be dealt with cooperatively, each one sealed inside a small cardboard box. </p>
<p id="w9Cj9L">“Instead of claiming the Crown or Command for yourself to win,” said associate brand manager Cait Drouin, “you’ll bury the Talismans in places of power, unseal the Portal of Power, and then defeat the adversary together. So players will need to share resources and fate to work together to complete five Trials with some very exciting surprises along the way.”</p>

<p id="uTMZps">While we don’t know for sure what’s inside the boxes, it does appear to be miniature of some kind. The back of the game box says you’ll “reveal unique mystery figures” as you go. So what are those figures? Our only clues are game materials that show a robed figure with a deer skull for a head; a conflagration with green-eyed monsters crawling out of it; a hero being pulled down by a mob; and a mysterious armored warrior holding a flag over a battlefield.</p>
<p id="y9xNqR">Avalon Hill stressed that <em>Alliances</em> is not a legacy-style game. Game designer Doug Hopkins stressed that there are no stickers, no writing on the game board, and no destroying of components.</p>
<p id="K6pfMN">“We’re [...] rolling out the experience to you one trial at a time,” Hopkins said. “You’ll get that thrill of when you complete the trial to unlock the next box and see what’s inside and then, of course, unlock the next trial so that hopefully you can watch the story unfold through multiple game sessions.”</p>

And it’s at the historic Greek Theatre, no less! But CEO Travis Willingham sees an opportunity to bring his performers’ special brand of magic to even more loving audiences — especially outside of the United States.</p>

<p id="nZk425">“Where else could we go?” Willingham wondered out loud in a recent interview with Polygon.</p>
<p id="q0BPUT">Ticket sales clearly point to an unmet need for live-action actual play performances among the genre’s most devoted fans. Critical Role’s London show easily drew more than 12,500 attendees. More recently, Dropout’s <em>Dimension 20</em> sold out Madison Square Garden, with a 19,500-seat capacity, in a matter of days. Live performance is back in a big way since the COVID-19 pandemic, and actual play needs to get on board — and start thinking even bigger.</p>
<p id="C4yq6H">“Especially after [Wembley and <em>Dimension 20</em>’s success selling out MSG], we have got to get out of the U.S. a little bit,” Willingham said. “We have to make sure we’re taking care of the rest of the U.S. [besides Los Angeles and the tabletop convention circuit], but can we go to Australia? Can we go to other targets in the EU? Can we go to South America? South America has been amazing in terms of our audience demographic, and we feel like it’s underserved.</p>
<p id="Vr1aHY">“It’s a logistical challenge to figure all those things out,” Willingham continued. “There’s really no playbook for these things. But no playbook [has] kind of [been] our MO for the last five or six years since we went independent. So we take a shot at it, we try and figure it out along the way, and we just kind of act on where we think people are wanting or indicating to us that they want to see us.”</p>
<p id="V5dM2m">The challenges of a live show are many, but they’re also a chance for the actors to go outside their comfort zones. For Willingham, that means letting his guard down and putting on a goofy costume every once in a while.</p>

<p id="9vXShg">“Me, I’m a T-shirt-and-jeans kind of guy,” Willingham said with a laugh. “We got some people in this group that just can’t be stopped. And then we throw somebody from wardrobe at them that can go out and source any crazy ideas we have, and it just gets taken to a 10.”</p>
<p id="l6nCng">But what Willingham is most excited about is digging ever deeper into the larger narrative that’s being crafted by <a href="https://www.polygon.com/entertainment/2020/11/18/21572254/critical-role-book-matt-mercer-maps-campaign-worldbuilding">Dungeon Master Matt Mercer</a>.</p>
<p id="68wTt4">“One of the things that I love and applaud the most about Matthew Mercer is that he has the craziest red-thread board somewhere in his mind,” Willingham said, <a href="https://youtu.be/1NBfZcNU4O0?t=19">referring to the well-worn meme from <em>It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia</em></a>. “If you watch campaign one and haven’t watched anything since; if you watched campaign two, <em>Mighty Nein</em>, and nothing else since; if you tune in for the Greek Theatre live show [...] there is instantly going to be components from both of those things that are already at stake. [...] So whether or not you are caught up, or don’t even know who the characters are, there’s something in there for you. [...] I’m sure our outfits will be worth it alone.”</p>
<p id="fEZSeK">Also? Maybe keep an eye on Willingham himself, who, more often than not, says he’s just trying to keep it together on stage.</p>

<p id="MdNO1y">“I’m terrible at keeping a poker face during our actual play,” Willingham said. “Matt starts getting into lore? I’m freaking out. Somebody starts flirting? I’m freaking out. So those things are just magnified with the screens that they have at the shows. But other than that, it’s just trying to control your heart rate before you take the stage and then knowing that you’re about to go through something incredible with thousands of people that have enjoyed the game that you love as much as they do.”</p>

Standing at a literal crossroads, you see a girl suspended in the air. Ominous voices explain that she will lead the world into chaos and ruin, and if you take her hand, you will enter into “a world yet unknown.” The game then asks you if you’ll take her hand, but what, exactly, are you getting yourself into with this decision?</p><div data-video-id="196923" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Kotaku’s Hopes For Spyro The Dragon’s (Reported) Comeback" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="355" data-playlist="196923,196922,196918" data-current="196923"><div><p>Kotaku’s Hopes For Spyro The Dragon’s (Reported) Comeback</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196923/196923_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196923/196923_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196923/196923_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196923/196923_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/22494.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><p>The decision to take the girl’s hand will determine which story path you’ll take in <em>Shin Megami Tensei V: Vengeance</em>. If you refuse to take her hand, you’ll embark on the <strong>Canon of Creation</strong>. This is the story that was featured in the 2021 original version of <em>Shin Megami Tensei V</em>, albeit with some new quests and quality of life changes. However, if you <em>do </em>take her hand, you’ll experience the <strong>Canon of Vengeance </strong>instead. This is the new story path, in which this mysterious girl will change key story beats and ultimately affect the outcome of the plot.<br></p><p>The game will explain all this <em>after </em>you make your choice, and it will give you the chance to alter your decision after explicitly telling you which path you’re about to take. However, once you make your decision, it’s set in stone for the rest of the game.<br></p><figure id="" data-id="9d8ccfb63365f5f6ff8cb207d93a015d" data-recommend-id="image://9d8ccfb63365f5f6ff8cb207d93a015d" data-format="jpg" data-width="2560" data-height="1440" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The girl looks up and to her right, in front of a colorful background." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The girl looks up and to her right, in front of a colorful background." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Atlus</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="9d8ccfb63365f5f6ff8cb207d93a015d" data-recommend-id="image://9d8ccfb63365f5f6ff8cb207d93a015d" data-format="jpg" data-width="2560" data-height="1440" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The girl looks up and to her right, in front of a colorful background." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><h2 id="h27954"><a id=""></a>Can you play the Canon of Vengeance first?</h2><p>If you’ve already played <em>Shin Megami Tensei V, </em>you’ll naturally want to play the Canon of Vengeance right off the bat. But if you’re new to <em>Shin Megami Tensei V</em>, is it okay to start with the Canon of Vengeance?</p><p>As <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://youtu.be/bGpbTXCVkwQ?si=KyEkyK7l1NRA2h9C&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://youtu.be/bGpbTXCVkwQ?si=KyEkyK7l1NRA2h9C" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">per Atlus themselves</a></span>, <strong>both of the canons are completely standalone stories that you can play in whatever order you’d like</strong>. Vengeance doesn’t rely on the player having pre-existing knowledge of the Creation path, so you’re free to pick whichever option sounds best to you.<br></p><p>I can personally attest to this, since <strong>this is my first time playing <em>Shin Megami Tensei V</em>, and the Vengeance path has been perfectly comprehensible so far</strong>. Nearly every plot point has been properly explained, and in the rare times that I’ve felt confused by the plot, I’ve often received an explanation within an hour or two of gameplay. <em>Shin Megami Tensei V</em> can occasionally feel vague, but rest assured that this is by design.<br></p><figure id="" data-id="b4ce30f6d6544f63af0f2d13405626df" data-recommend-id="image://b4ce30f6d6544f63af0f2d13405626df" data-format="jpg" data-width="2560" data-height="1440" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Hanging out with your gang, with long, flowing blue hair." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Hanging out with your gang, with long, flowing blue hair." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Atlus</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="b4ce30f6d6544f63af0f2d13405626df" data-recommend-id="image://b4ce30f6d6544f63af0f2d13405626df" data-format="jpg" data-width="2560" data-height="1440" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Hanging out with your gang, with long, flowing blue hair." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><h2 id="h27955"><a id=""></a>Is the Canon of Vengeance better than the Canon of Creation?</h2><p>I’m hesitant to say something as subjective as one story is “better” than the other. You’ll find <em>Shin Megami Tensei </em>fans who say the story of the fifth game was a disappointment, while others will say it was just fine. Nonetheless, <strong>I’d suggest new players choose Vengeance if they want the superior first experience</strong>, simply because of one neat gameplay gimmick.</p><p>Exclusive to the Vengeance story are Guest characters. In short, you can occasionally use the other human characters you travel with in your party, complete with their own sets of skills that they can learn as they level up. For instance, in the opening areas of the game, Vengeance has you travel with Yoko Hiromine (that’s the girl whose hand you took). She can hit three different elemental weaknesses, has a heal skill to use in a pinch, and she can even debuff the enemy’s Attack stat. Also, her passive ability lets her automatically revive any demons at the end of combat as long as she’s in the party.<br></p><p>In other words, Guest characters are really useful! If you’re still wrapping your head around the team-building aspects of <em>Shin Megami Tensei V</em>, you can almost always rely on your guest party members in a pinch. They don’t take up slots in your party list either, so you can still construct your own army of demons to use if you’d prefer. Even as someone who really enjoys fusing the perfect monsters to counter specific boss battles, I found myself using Yoko a lot in the early game of the Vengeance story.<br></p><p>For this reason alone, I’d say Vengeance is the ideal choice for first-time players of <em>Shin Megami Tensei V</em>. If you’d like to experience the stories in their release order, then you should start with the Canon of Creation. Otherwise, just follow your heart and choose whichever option sounds most appealing to you. You can’t really go wrong either way.<br></p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Years of increasingly idiotic ideas piling on top of one another, but always boiling down to the core concept of clicking on a picture of a cookie.

It’s a free game about clicking on a picture of a banana for no discernible reward, and it’s taking over Steam.<br></p><div data-video-id="196923" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Kotaku’s Hopes For Spyro The Dragon’s (Reported) Comeback" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="355" data-playlist="196923,196922,196918" data-current="196923"><div><p>Kotaku’s Hopes For Spyro The Dragon’s (Reported) Comeback</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196923/196923_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196923/196923_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196923/196923_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196923/196923_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/22494.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><p>It’s important to emphasize just how ridiculous <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/2923300/Banana/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2923300/Banana/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Banana</em></a></span><em> </em>truly is. You’re likely thinking there’s more to it, that there are surprise twists and turns, all the usual gimmicks and features of the breakout clicker games. Please, I implore you, put these hopes and dreams aside. This is a “game” about clicking on a static jpeg of a banana, while a crude, Arial-font number counter ticks up. That’s it. It doesn’t even remember your clicks when you load it back up. And right now, as I type, it has over 400,000 people playing it.</p><p>The game—such as it is—originally launched in April, and no one noticed. By mid-May a few people started paying attention, but in the last week that number has shot up to see <em>Banana</em> sitting high on the Steam charts, and seemingly only going up. And this implausible success is leading to <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aitVHsg0rWA&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aitVHsg0rWA" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">conspiratorial claims</a></span> and furious Steam reviews decrying its cynical attempts to [clutch petticoat] <em>make money</em>.</p><figure id="" data-id="90bffcb1c7d129f0c5464af424249bd0" data-recommend-id="image://90bffcb1c7d129f0c5464af424249bd0" data-format="jpg" data-width="1437" data-height="930" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="It's the banana item store." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="It's the banana item store." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Kotaku / Valve</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="90bffcb1c7d129f0c5464af424249bd0" data-recommend-id="image://90bffcb1c7d129f0c5464af424249bd0" data-format="jpg" data-width="1437" data-height="930" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="It's the banana item store." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Every three and eighteen hours, if you’ve got the game running and you’ve clicked at least once, <em>Banana</em> will drop a picture of a banana into your Steam inventory. Every three hours you get a “common” banana, and every eighteen hours you get an allegedly “rare” banana. Then, if you can be bothered, you can buy and sell these images via Steam’s Community Market. There’s also a rotating supply of five different bananas you can buy from the “<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/itemstore/2923300/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/itemstore/2923300/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Banana Item Store</a></span>” for 25 cents each.</p><p>So, because gamers, there’s a roaring trade going on Steam, and a lively community developing in its Discord. And that’s making people mad.</p><p>It’s understandable that some are drawing associations with <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/nft-market-collapse-square-enix-ubisoft-sega-konami-sca-1848878945&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/nft-market-collapse-square-enix-ubisoft-sega-konami-sca-1848878945">the miserable NFT pyramid schemes</a></span> we saw come and go over the last few years, given both are ways of exchanging worthless images. However, it’s important to note this is not that. <em>Banana</em> isn’t burning down rainforests to log its jpegs on a blockchain, nor taking part in a pump-n-dump that’ll leave its marks having spent upward of millions on <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/nft-meaning-scam-crypto-marketplace-price-bored-ape-1850860661&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/nft-meaning-scam-crypto-marketplace-price-bored-ape-1850860661">literally nothing</a></span>. It’s just an asset flip on Steam that’s making a good chunk of profit off of people goofing around selling their banana images for 3 cents a time.</p><p>It’s dumb. Unquestionably, enormously dumb. And yeah, the developers behind it are making money, given they get a slice every time there’s a sale on the Community Market. Those cents add up, and there’s a decent chance they’re making a few thousand bucks a day while the game grips onto the zeitgeist. But, to break out one of the great philosophical arguments of our time, so?</p><figure id="" data-id="436350de8d5515390c93c4ef6bf56b21" data-recommend-id="image://436350de8d5515390c93c4ef6bf56b21" data-format="jpg" data-width="946" data-height="556" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The ever-growing graph of Banana's popularity." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The ever-growing graph of Banana's popularity." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Kotaku / SteamDB</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="436350de8d5515390c93c4ef6bf56b21" data-recommend-id="image://436350de8d5515390c93c4ef6bf56b21" data-format="jpg" data-width="946" data-height="556" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The ever-growing graph of Banana's popularity." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>These chancers took elements from a couple of Unity asset packs, and then saw if they could make a quick buck from the hype that attaches itself to something this silly. Unless they start trying to fix prices on the Market, or it’s revealed that the banana images contain secret mind-control micro-drawings that turn us all into their robot minions, then they’re simply taking advantage of a system that allows people to goof around.</p><p>It’s odd to see people leaving livid reviews at how this is conning people into thinking they’re going to be able to make money selling their items, despite the game making no such claims, and, you know, being free. The reality is, it’s just stupid. It’s a stupid, boring non-game, taking advantage of the stupidity of communities swapping stupid jpegs. And, at some level, it’s 400,000 people clicking on a picture of a banana.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>During today’s Final Fantasy 14 letter from the producer <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0JxPTIiDWtI" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">live streaming event</a>, director Naoki Yoshida denied any involvement in a Final Fantasy 9 remake.</p>



<p>Yoshida, also known as Yoshi-P, had a translator present for the live event. It seems that machine translations during a previous interview from a Dawntrail tour may have caused confusion about plans for their next projects. </p>



<p>In today’s live event, Yoshida clarified via his translator that he is “not working on any sort of Final Fantasy 9 remake.” </p>

</p></figure>



<p>However, Yoshida did call Final Fantasy 9 a “wonderful, wonderful title,” and quite hefty. Yoshida added that given the scope of the game, “we would have to be very careful and mindful if we were to handle Final Fantasy 9.”</p>



<p>The Final Fantasy 14 director also addressed comments that if Yoshida did take on an FF9 remake, they would make it an action game. Instead, Yoshida said that “whomever would handle it would probably make it turn-based,” and that they would do so to.</p>



<p>Final Fantasy 14 <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/final-fantasy-14-open-beta-announced-for-xbox/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">held an Open Beta</a> for the Xbox version last February. The announcement mentioned that players will need an Xbox Game Pass to play the full Xbox Series X|S version.</p>



<p>Square Enix’s Final Fantasy 14 Dawntrail expansion will launch on July 2, 2024, and pre-orders are available now. Early access is scheduled to begin on June 28, 2024, at 2 am PDT.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/kingdom-hearts-hd-1-52-5-becomes-the-top-seller-on-steam-in-less-than-a-day/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=kingdom-hearts-hd-1-52-5-becomes-the-top-seller-on-steam-in-less-than-a-day<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="419" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Given the anticipation for the <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/kingdom-hearts-games-make-steam-debut-on-june-13/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">long-awaited Steam releases of the <em>Kingdom Hearts</em> games</a>, it should come as no surprise to hear that they’re selling well. In less than 24 hours, the <em>HD 1.5+2.5 ReMIX</em> compilation has rocketed up the platform’s sales charts and is currently <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/search/?filter=topsellers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the top-selling Steam game</a>, outperforming even <em>Helldivers 2</em> and <em>Shin Megami Tensei 5: Vengeance</em>, the latter of which only launched today.</p> <p data-characters="653" data-current-count="653" data-injectable="true">While the series has been available for PC owners via the Epic Games Store since 2021, Steam users have obviously wanted to see it launch on their platform of choice. I have to imagine a decent number of these sales are a result of established fans buying the games again (I should know, I’m one of them). Aside from them being playable on Steam Deck, Square Enix is discounting the whole series by 31% until July 11. So, the <em>HD 1.5+2.5</em> collection, which consists of four games and two cutscene compilations, is going for $34.49/£27.59. You can even get the whole series (seven games in total) for $68.99/£58.64, which is a frankly amazing deal.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot via Square Enix YouTube</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="405" data-current-count="705" data-injectable="true">Admittedly, the <em>Kingdom Hearts 2.8</em> collection and <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-kingdom-hearts-iii/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kingdom Hearts 3</a></em> aren’t performing as strongly, and are ranked much lower in the Steam sales chart. They also have smaller player counts according to SteamDB, peaking at only 186 players (<a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2552440/charts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">for <em>KH2.8</em></a>) and 817 players (<a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2552450/charts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">for <em>KH3</em></a>). By comparison, the <em>HD 1.5+2.5</em> collection peaked at 6,809 players and, at the time of writing, <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2552430/charts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">has 4,336 concurrent players</a>.</p>
 <p data-characters="353" data-current-count="353" data-injectable="false">It makes sense for the <em>HD 1.5+2.5</em> collection to be the most popular. It’s the cheapest of the three offers, it includes more games, and it’s also the recommended starting point for new fans, covering the first eight years of <em>Kingdom Hearts</em> content. As such, <em>KH2.8</em> and <em>KH3</em> could start to pick up in player count in the coming weeks or months.</p> <p data-characters="582" data-current-count="935" data-injectable="false">It’ll be interesting to see how long the <em>HD 1.5+2.5</em> collection stays at the top of the sales charts but, regardless, this has hopefully proved to Square Enix that there’s an audience for future <em>Kingdom Hearts</em> games on Steam. With any luck, <em>Kingdom Hearts 4 </em>will come to PC the same day as its console counterpart, which isn’t too far-fetched considering Square Enix <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/expect-more-multiplatform-square-enix-games-as-company-pledges-itself-to-new-aggressive-strategy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wants more multiplatform titles in the future</a>. Presumably, <em>KH4</em> is at least in development for PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S, but there’s been no official confirmation on release platforms.</p>

            <p>
Lollipop Chainsaw RePOP - the rerelease of cult classic Lollipop Chainsaw, which sees highschool cheerleader Juliet fighting off scores of zombies while wearing her boyfriend's severed head on her belt  - has secured itself a release date.
</p>
<p>
Lollipop Chainsaw RePOP will launch digitally for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch, and PC via Steam on 25th September. A physical release will then follow, with developer Dragami Games stating more details will be released "at a later date".
</p>
<p>
You can check out the first trailer for Lollipop Chainsaw RePOP below:

<p>
Described as the "definitive" version of Lollipop Chainsaw, RePOP will bring a number of quality of life features to the game, leaving the story itself unchanged. 
</p>
<p>
These changes include reduced load times, adjusted input timings for Combo Actions and the introduction of an auto-fire mode for the Chainsaw Blaster. 
</p>
<p>
The game's chainsaw action has also been sped up thanks to the introduction of the Chained Hits Hunting system, in which "chaining multiple hits in succession increases the player's attack speed". Additionally, the team has added new costumes, chainsaws and hair colours. 
</p>
<p>
This rerelease of Lollipop Chainsaw was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/lollipop-chainsaw-remake-confirmed-for-2023">first announced back in 2022</a>, with the original plan to launch the game in 2023. However, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/lollipop-chainsaw-remake-delayed-to-2024">RePOP saw its release delayed</a> in order for the developers to ensure the game reached "the best possible quality experience", something which required it to "extend the development period".

<p>In <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/lollipop-chainsaw-review">Eurogamer's original Lollipop Chainsaw review</a>, our Donlan called it "a muddle of pop culture nods, scattershot puns and antic gore".</p>
<p>"It all makes for an oddball game that struggles to be odd in the right way. Despite the clever, if patchy, script and some great performances... there just isn't enough fun lurking in the combat to keep you entertained when a level goes on a bit longer than it should, when an extended joke or homage isn't quite witty enough to earn its keep, when the upgrade shop isn't filled with anything you'd really want to buy, and when the tone descends into damp sleaze," he wrote in 2012, because yes it really has been that long.</p>

  <p id="1Ma6VD"><em>Metaphor: ReFantazio</em>’s developers are not being subtle about the themes they’re seeking to tackle in this game. The upcoming RPG takes place in a medieval setting that is a mirror to our contemporary world. The world-within-a-world depiction of a utopia, illustrated as a modern city during a cutscene, is considered an anomaly. The game’s characters read about it in a book, in which it’s told that no soul is born into discrimination, and all lives are equal. “It really does sound like a fantasy,” says Gallica, the protagonist’s companion.</p>
<p id="9ZWtiR">The Persona series has always woven real-life issues into worlds riddled with fantasy. These efforts have faltered and not always stuck the landing, with <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/23959649/persona-5-tactica-review-story-phantom-thieves-xcom"><em>Persona 5 Tactica</em></a> being a recent example. Now, as key ex-Persona developers prepare to launch <em>Metaphor: ReFantazio</em> later this year, the stakes have never been higher, as they take a new step with a bold attitude, albeit also with some clear familiarity.</p>
<p id="ZTNakU">During a hands-on demo at Summer Game Fest 2024, I played three different sections of Atlus’ upcoming RPG, totaling about an hour. The first was set early in the game before the protagonist summons his powers, acting as a tutorial of sorts that introduced the story and some of the key design standouts when compared to Persona.</p>

<p id="SkDiRT">For one, the protagonist is voiced. This might sound like a small detail, but compared to previous Atlus games that often had more of a self-insert hero, the voice acting adds authority and a more specific sense of personality to the choices you make during conversations. From my time with the game, it seems not every single dialogue bit is fully voiced, but rather the ones that occur during main story-related sections as well as convos with key characters, which is fair. At other times, such as when taking on activities with companions — similar to hanging out with your fellow students to increase your Social Links — the protagonist said a few phrases instead, like Joker from <em>Persona 5</em> does when performing certain actions.</p>

<p id="FjOaIw">The structure of the story is another outlier. You’re essentially going on a road trip while recruiting people and taking on requests. There are main objectives that serve as deadlines, but aside from that, you’re free to explore and spend time as you see fit. The demo offered a glimpse of this in the second section, as I traveled to a dungeon in search of a missing person. The overworld map, which is beautifully drawn, has indicators for the time of day and weather conditions as well.</p>
<p id="D8xdBl">Again, if you’ve played Persona before, you’ll be able to hit the ground running in this game. As I explored the dungeon, however, I witnessed some standout features that shake up the usual process of trying to get an advantage attack on enemies to initiate combat. In <em>Metaphor: ReFantazio</em>, there are multiple ways to do this. If you spot a stronger enemy, you can perform multiple real-time attacks to weaken them before diving into a classic turn-based encounter. Don’t expect full-on hack-and-slash gameplay, though, as the protagonist can only do a few sets of attacks, but these did feel satisfactory each time.</p>
<p id="jzqEdo">If you manage to sneak around an enemy without them seeing you, you’ll perform one strong attack instead, leaving them stunned. For smaller or weaker enemies, you can just take them down in real time without the need to do an actual encounter for what would essentially be a quick turn. The dungeon I did wasn’t too big, but it was refreshing to be able to tackle groups of foes with ease and get some experience and loot as I worked my way to the objective.</p>

<p id="AI6CTh">Speaking of which, exploiting weaknesses is still the bread and butter of every turn-based fight. The key difference here is that you no longer have Personas at your disposal. Rather, <em>Metaphor</em> introduces Archetypes, which work in a similar way — you take on the qualities of the Archetype as you fight, gaining different skills to use in battle. The Archetype lineup is made up of the usual RPG classes that you can expect (mage, warrior, and so on). Whenever you meet a key companion and create a bond with them, you’ll unlock a new Archetype. I was able to see a glimpse of the Archetype’s corresponding skill tree, and it seems some of these classes can be leveled up to rank 20, so it’ll likely take you a while to unlock the full potential of each.</p>
<p id="J5eGZy">These Archetypes can perform joint attacks with other party members, adding another layer on top of the usual basic attack and magic abilities. Some are focused on dealing damage with a specific element (fire, ice, and so on) while others can heal party members or add a debuff to multiple foes at once.</p>
<p id="CvIOLr">Most of the abilities and items carry the same naming conventions as the ones in Persona and Shin Megami Tensei at large, which makes it easier to pick things up. Even in the demo, combat got pretty hard fast, especially with enemies being able to stock extra turns themselves as well. I was stocked up with an absurd amount of healing items, but I dread the thought of meeting some of the foes I fought without stopping by the nearest merchant shop first. (In case you’re wondering, yes, the protagonist can die during combat, and you can continue using your party members instead of getting a game over screen.)</p>

<p id="ij2LIx">From my short time blitzing in and out of combat, the visuals of <em>Metaphor: ReFantazio</em> look  even more flashy in motion. I was worried that general art design would mimic <em>Persona 5</em> too closely, compromising its own vision in favor of overly pushing for stylization like <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/24054581/persona-3-reload-review-remake-xbox-ps5-pc-atlus"><em>Persona 3 Reload</em></a> did. While it can be a bit overwhelming at first, <em>Metaphor</em>’s art direction is constantly cementing its own tone, which is in part complemented by the use of anime-style cutscenes, which happen more frequently during story beats and also appear when you’re entering turn-based combat.</p>
<p id="1dv1oW">As I recall my time with the demo, there’s a long list of reasons to be excited about <em>Metaphor</em>. The enemy designs, the potential around Archetypes, all the subtle refinements to systems that have been in iteration for decades across the Shin Megami Tensei universe at large — all feel like both a culmination of ideas and an all-hands-on-deck approach to create a new series. But I keep coming back to the story themes, and their potential to showcase whether or not this group of veteran developers has reflected on the legacy they’ve built over the years with their teams at large.</p>
<p id="FdeclX">When I first entered the dungeon, it was made clear that somebody had attacked a group of guards, and we were tasked with looking for any survivors. The first one we found, who was on his last breath, said he’d rather die than speak to the protagonist’s kind. As the main structure of <em>Metaphor</em> revolves around creating bonds with characters from all over the realm, each with their own backstories and races, I’m curious to see how the game will tackle the concept of equality, or lack thereof, that its characters see as such a rarity. The use of different voice dialects for companions, as well as the story putting these themes front and center even in an hour-long demo, are promising. I’m hoping these themes are an aspect of the game that manages to break from the familiarity we’ve grown used to in the past few years. </p>

<p>In <a href="https://x.com/JHight_Gamer/status/1801330355204722933" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a new post</a> on X, general manager of the Warcraft franchise John Hight announced they are leaving Blizzard after 12 years of work.</p>



<p>Throughout the lengthy thread, Hight thanked the Warcraft community for their support and passion for the franchise.</p>



<p>Although Hight said “it was a tough decision,” they did not explain exactly why they are stepping away. They also did not confirm what their next position could be. However, they did add that they plan to “explore new opportunities and challenges in the industry.” </p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>After 12 incredible years at Blizzard, I’ve decided to step away &amp; start a new quest.</p><p>It was a tough decision, but I feel like now is as good a time as any: Warcraft is in an amazing position as the universe turns 30.</p><p>I’ve been so honored to serve all of the heroes of Azeroth.</p></div>— John Hight (@JHight_Gamer) <a href="https://twitter.com/JHight_Gamer/status/1801330355204722933?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 13, 2024</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>Warcraft fans can at least look forward to Hight choosing to “continue making great games with talented people.” Hight also noted that Warcraft is currently “in an amazing position,” making their decision timely.</p>



<p>During the latest Xbox Games Showcase, World of Warcraft <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/world-of-warcraft-the-war-within-trailer-provides-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">got a new trailer</a> for the anticipated expansion The War Within. </p>



<p>Although it was cinematic, it did tease a variety of characters and confirm a concrete release date. The War Within will launch on August 26, 2024. The new trailer also teased a Welcome to Azeroth Bundle, available for a limited time.</p>



<p>So, World of Warcraft certainly continues to thrive, building hype and evolving. It is currently unclear who will take on Hight’s role for the Warcraft franchise at Blizzard. Although fans were dismayed Hight is moving on, many showed their support and excitement for Hight’s next position.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/interviews/discussing-vampire-therapist-and-its-historical-importance-educational-aspects<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2481020/Vampire_Therapist/"><em>Vampire Therapist</em></a> is a new narrative story game from Little Bat Games about a cowboy vampire learning the ways of Cognitive Development Theory as they practice their therapeutic skills on other vampires looking to live a better life.</p>
<p>Gameplay for the most part in<em> Vampire Therapist</em> is akin to an <em>Ace Attorney</em> title, except instead of pointing out people's lies you're calling them out on Cognitive Distortions, such as Polar Thinking or the Control Fallacy.</p>
<p>Earlier this week we had a chance to sit down with Cyrus Nemati, the solo developer at Little Bat Games, to discuss the inception of <em>Vampire Therapist,</em> what it was like working with licensed therapists on the characters, and why this game is so damn horny.</p>
<p><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed//nL14c3dbfZo"></iframe></p>
<h2>Origins of Little Bat Games</h2>
<p>It's important to know that with the assistance of contractors, Nemati is the one and only 'full-timer' at Little Bat Games. He got his start in the games industry as a voice-over actor. "My favorite toy as a kid was my tape recorder, and I always wanted to be a voice actor."</p>
<p>While that wasn't possible early on in his career, he made the switch in his late 20s moving from a role in Public Advocacy in D.C. and moved to LA to follow his dream. Most recently you might have heard Nemati voicing Ares or Dionysus in <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/hades"><em>Hades</em></a>, Almer in <em>Pyre</em>, and Boris Petrovic in <em>Duck Detective</em>.</p>
<p>Coupled with his background in writing, it allowed for Namanti to continue voice acting while also transitioning into writing for games too. After moving to Germany, Nemati began working full time in a game studio but, according to him, "turns out that didn't agree with me either, so I started my own studio and this is what brings us here."</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/vampire-therapist-sam-and-andy.jpg?itok=ixvLgS5N 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/vampire-therapist-sam-and-andy.jpg?itok=kIMEf1lF 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>An important part of being a therapist is being in therapy yourself</figcaption></figure><p>At Little Bat Studios, Nemati explained that he has "been doing all of the writing, most of the programming work, all of the design work, and generally running the whole thing." He also complimented his team of contractors who are able to help round out other areas of development.</p>
<p>In discussing the impending release of <em>Vampire Therapist</em>, coming out on Steam on July 18, Nemati spoke about how "all [he] wants to do is make more," revealing that he has a whole sequel already planned that the initial game will lead towards.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Siring A Vampire Therapist</h2>
<p>"One of the nice things about the game is that I think [what it is] is in the title," he said.</p>
<p>Nemati explained that in <em>Vampire Therapist</em> you "are a Vampire who is a Therapist who is treating vampires who need therapy.</p>
<p>"In doing so you are learning therapy concepts and applying them directly," he said. "The whole point of the game was the idea that the problems we have as humans are not new, they are quite old, and Vampires were a great way of jumping in and saying, 'Let's start working on these problems we've had for thousands of years.'"</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/vampire-therapist-andromachus-and-cognitive-distortions.jpg?itok=S1C2ibr5 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/vampire-therapist-andromachus-and-cognitive-distortions.jpg?itok=D0tsSYDn 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Just a few of the many Cognitive Distortions</figcaption></figure><p>To talk about his inspiration behind the game, Namanti laughed as he explained. "I've had a lot of therapy myself," he said, "and that a lot of it comes from the scene in <em>Twilight </em>where Edward Cullen starts playing the piano and the camera swooping over him and it's dramatic and it's meant to sound really great but really it's just doodley doodley doodley.</p>
<p>"We're supposed to be impressed because he's had 200 years to practice," Namanti continued, "but why should he be good? Just because he's had 200 years. That got me thinking about Vampires that you see in the media, they don't do a lot; they act sexy, they bite necks, they have their vampire society, they kill each other and humans, that's kind of it. If you have forever there's no reason we couldn't send a vampire to Mars, they don't die!"</p>
<p>The protagonist of this adventure is Sam Walls, a cowboy vampire. With the very traditional vampire Andromachus, I wanted to understand why it was such an unconventional hero that would be at the center of this story.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/vampire-therapist-sams-journal.jpg?itok=DLOy_RW_ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/vampire-therapist-sams-journal.jpg?itok=EbmZ7ozt 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Keeping detailed notes will help you learn as much as you can from Andy</figcaption></figure><p>"Andy (Andromachus) was originally going to be the main character for a long time. I had written several scripts, the comedy was great, but Andy is very intelligent, very old, he's seen everything, he sucked the humor out of the room. It was just not working," Nemati said.</p>
<p>It was in understanding that <em>Vampire Therapist </em>is also a learning experience that Nemati knew he couldn't have someone all-knowing. "I needed a character who was more down-home, more relatable, not as intimidating but there were historical reasons for having Walls involved."</p>
<p>A lot factored into making Walls the best protagonist, including the Transcendentalism of the time, but also his time roaming state parks that would "allow him to appreciate life, even if he is dead."</p>
<h2>Therapy Is In Session</h2>
<p>On the other side of the couch, Walls will encounter a variety of characters, each with a different distortion that they're centered around.&nbsp;</p>
<p>"Dr Drayne is a doctor who is trying to come up with a synthetic drug for 400 years [...] and is disappointed in himself for not making progress. Isabella d'Este has family issues and is in a major Italian dynastic family that's full of extreme drama. Another character is a child actor, and one has major internet issues which I think we're all facing now," he said.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"It's always come down to with each character, what is the punchline? What is the funny thing that I want to delve into?"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Later on in our talk, Nemati reinforced just how important the historical background of some of these characters is. An interesting fact that he learned while working with Isabella d'Este's chief historian at UC Davis was&nbsp;"that her body is missing, nobody knows where it went. So as far as we know the [Vampire Therapist] story is real."</p>
<h2>Pulling From Therapeutic Experience</h2>
<p>Throughout the process of creating <em>Vampire Therapist</em>, Nemati has also been working with a group of licensed therapists. "You know the thing is, people in academia [...] are really excited that brings ideas to the mainstream." Many of the therapists that he worked with were excited to work on the project because it meant that more people would get exposed to so many of the concepts that they find interesting.</p>
<p>Nemati went into further detail on the scope of his contributors as he didn't "just work with therapists but also with historians on some of the characters. They want to make it work, and that is a really good starting point."</p>

<p>While Nemati wanted to make sure that the experience for players was fun, it was also important that the core concepts were accurate. "It made the writing much harder, because I had to learn in clinical terms, and there was a lot that I learned that I didn't necessarily agree with.</p>
<p>"The idea of the game is that you're identifying Cognitive Distortions; these are ideas that we have in our head that don't align with reality. Where we're not respecting reality. For instance, there is a theory that if a Distortion isn't negative, it's not considered a Distortion," he said. "I respected that while making my own jokes on top of that.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"I have fought with therapists, I have fought with editors to figure out 'How do I do this right?' and 'How do I do this funny?'"</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The focus that Nemati is going into this game with is that it should be a fun experience and that everything that a player learns along the way about cognitive behavioral therapy (or about themselves) is rewarding.</p>
<h2>Writing For Cognitive Distortions</h2>
<p>Detailing the writing process itself, Nemati explained that for each session the protagonist will go into, he has a list of all of the Cognitive Distortions in the game. As he's writing each session, he has to ensure not only that he hits each one, but that everything still feels "natural."</p>
<p>"It's a different style of writing," Nemati described writing to hit each of the Distortions. "I have to make sure that I'm writing with intention and that I still have a plot. The game part is a formula that I have to hit."</p>

<p>As the player learns about more Cognitive Distortions, of which there are 13 in the game, going into every session, players will get to pick five for their toolbar. He wanted to avoid a situation where you're essentially harassing a client "because they're doing all of them," but this way players can only actually call out five.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Originally when I conceived of these ideas I talked to UI/UX people and asked, 'How do I get 13 buttons on the screen?' and they said, 'Don't.'"</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Bringing These Characters To Life</h2>
<p><em>Vampire Therapist </em>has a well-known cast of characters, not just including Cyrus Nemati himself but recently announced additions to the cast, including Matthew Mercer and Sarah Greyson.</p>
<p>"I had two main elements that I really wanted to capture; one is that I need really impeccable comic timing. I need actors who know exactly how long to wait before letting something drop. I need the emotionality in there as well," Nemati said of the voice direction process.</p>

<p>"These characters go to the darkest places, it is a comedy game but in the fourth act you will see there are these revelations, there are breakthroughs and I needed them to go to those places," he said. "I really needed actors who were able to have that breadth."</p>
<p>Speaking of casting, Nemati didn't just stress how in-depth that process was, but also that it was something done privately. "I just knew I needed something special, and I aimed for those targets and I got them by the strength of the roles I was offering."</p>
<h2>When Not In Session</h2>
<p>Players won't just be spending time in session as they'll also be interacting with staff and patrons of the Goth Nightclub that sits underneath the Therapist Office.</p>
<p>Early on players get to meet Crimson, the bartender and blood partner of Andy, as well as a Goth couple, Reinhart and Maxi. It was very early on that the topic of drinking blood and being invited to vampiric threesomes came up, so I simply had to know from Nemati, why is <em>Vampire Therapist </em>so horny?</p>

<p>"Because it's vampires, it comes with the territory. Ever since <em>Interview With A Vampire,&nbsp;</em>the impact that that book and movie had on vampires cannot be undone," he said. "They will always be like this. I got a lot of inspiration not only from that, but the Key and Peele sketch, the sexy vampire sketch, where the vampires are acting all sexy and there's a new vampire who comes in and he's like, 'What are you all doing, aren't we just meant to bite necks, why are you all wearing leather?'"</p>
<p>Nemati continued that it wasn't just because of Vampire's horniness in pop culture but, "The horniness is funny, that's why I lean into it, and plus setting it above a Goth Club was a way of making it all consensual. Vampires drink consensual Goth blood and it means that there is kind of a horny environment below them at all times."</p>
<h2><em>Vampire Therapist</em> Demo Impressions</h2>
<p>A demo for <em>Vampire Therapist</em> has already hit Steam, with it being in the hands of the public for the first time, Nemati has been getting a lot of positive feedback. "It has been really wonderful to see, they have been resonating with Sam and Andy, they have been recognizing these distortions in themselves, and feeling seen in a positive way.</p>
<p>"Of course they let me know of all the bugs that I don't notice myself [...] but really the response has been magnificent," he said. "I've watched all of the streams on Twitch, seeing people laughing and their audiences go wild when the big punchlines hit is exactly what I'm looking for."</p>

<p>In talking about the lessons and understanding that players will come away from the experience of <em>Vampire Therapist </em>Nemati explained, "From the start the idea has been that we all as humans all need Therapy in order to cope with this existence. To think that we don't need it, that is the biggest distortion of all."&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Really, I want to destigmatize therapy, that is my approach here."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>One thing that Nemati does really want people to embrace when playing <em>Vampire Therapist</em> is picking the wrong answers. Namanti related his humor to that of a game he grew up playing, <em>Monkey Island</em>. "I hope people will start clicking [the wrong answers] and I'm going to start thinking how I can give the players clear permission to click the wrong answers because there are some funny ones. If you talk to Dr. Drayne and you ask why you think he's there, just do the funny answer and see what happens."</p>
<p>You can check out to demo for <em>Vampire Therapist</em> for free on Steam. When the game fully releases on July 18th, it will be available on Steam as well as on GOG. Nemati joked that as you're typing in "Vampire The…" on Steam, it will come up right underneath <em>Vampire The Masquerade,&nbsp;</em>which is a good place to be.</p>
<p>You can also check out more from Cyrus on social media like <a href="https://x.com/ahoymehearties?lang=en">Twitter&nbsp;</a>or <a href="https://www.cyrusontheinternet.com/">on his own website</a> (that he admits he hasn't updated in a while).</p>

			<p><span>Of all the genres that NetEase has had a hand in publishing, a competitive fast-paced FPS hasn’t yet been one of them. The newly announced FragPunk from Bad Guitar Studio, a subsidiary of NetEase’s ThunderFire Studio, aims to bring the competitive 5v5 gunplay to the masses with a unique twist: Shard Cards. We got to experience the chaotic clash firsthand with a few rounds accompanied by two of the lead developers on the project.</span></p>

<figure></figure>

<p><span>Recently unveiled during the Xbox Games Showcase, FragPunk is a fusion between two of the most popular competitive FPS on the market: Overwatch and Counter-Strike. From the former, Fragpunk utilizes a hero system for unique character abilities and a bright and colorful aesthetic that pops from against the more muted backgrounds; from the latter, round-based bomb defusal missions and an artificial limitation on what weapons can be used per round. While the devs didn’t let us take a deep dive into the equipment systems, rather than buying weapons between rounds, players pick both their hero and weapon loadouts with a number counter indicating how many times they could be purchased per match.</span></p>
<p><span>Each of the ten-plus champions, or Lancers in the FragPunk universe, come with their own set of three abilities that each operate on separate cooldowns. The most obvious of character abilities mimicked a smoke grenade that defenders would frequently deploy to obscure lines of sight but players should expect to see more than a few surprises that don’t usually pop up in the wide range of hero shooters already on the market. These augment the primary, secondary, and melee weapons players pick out before each round, and with game types switching from defenders and attackers, will see drastically different hero selections per match. I inquired with the devs if there would be a sort of pick/ban system that could be implemented but it didn’t quite sound like that was an option on the table just yet.</span></p>
<figure>

<p><span>What separates FragPunk from its contemporaries and even the likes of <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1785150/Friends_vs_Friends/">Friends vs Friends</a> is the Shard Card system. With over 70 different ability cards to drop between matches, players will get a randomly drawn hand between each round and play cards that all have drastically different effects from each other. During the draft phase, players can also see which cards the enemy team is looking to play. Once the team finishes playing/discarding cards, the final three cards selected are locked in. From here, players can spend crystals to power up certain cards and increase their effectiveness. One of these cards increased magazine size each time players boosted it in the match and, in turn, enhanced my pump-action shotgun to mow down the entire enemy team without needing to pull back and reload. Other silly rules, like Big Head Mode and others, bring some variety to the tactics players on both sides will need to deal with. Some bring passive effects to the map including introducing a Bombsite C or plant overgrowth while others directly impact combat such as a chain lightning that bounces between enemies when struck.</span></p>
<p><iframe title="FragPunk World Premiere Extended Trailer - Join Closed Alpha Now" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jCamS2DSfj4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p><span>Now while I don’t consider FragPunk a proper esports contender (its random nature is far too chaotic without restricting the card pool to something more manageable), it already has its hooks in me as another fun shooter to pick up on the weekends with friends. In the ever-expanding sea of hero shooters, FragPunk still has a unique draw that will entice players to see what’s on the table when it launches for PC and Xbox Series S|X in 2025.</span></p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/inside-out-2-revives-the-old-pixar-magic.901449/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/reviews/24178014/inside-out-2-review<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="5mbZVQ">The problem with iterating on a movie as perfectly complete as Pete Docter’s 2015 Pixar feature <em>Inside Out</em> is that a neatly closed narrative loop doesn’t leave a lot of obvious next steps for the story. <em>Inside Out</em> is half a world-building exercise in <a href="https://thedissolve.com/reviews/1663-inside-out/">establishing an elaborate visual metaphor and testing its flexibility</a>, half a coming-of-age story about an 11-year-old navigating a big life change. But its real point is confirming to the audience that sadness — an element that’s core to <a href="https://www.polygon.com/movies/22239548/best-pixar-movies-ranked">Pixar’s best movies</a> — isn’t just an inescapable part of life, it has an important purpose. So what’s left for a sequel? Reiterating that sadness <em>still</em> isn’t all bad? Moving down the list of characters to express the importance of anger and fear?</p>
<p id="g4NJ6G"><a href="https://www.polygon.com/24093549/inside-out-2-new-emotions-trailer-ennui-envy-embarassment"><em>Inside Out 2</em>’s initial trailers</a> suggested that the answer was “introduce a whole lot of new characters,” a <a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CousinOliver">historically risky gambit</a> that seemed likely to complicate the setting without necessarily adding anything it needed. And with Docter not leading the project, all the usual questions about <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24171622/2024-movie-sequels-prequels-ranked-least-to-most-essential">whether the original movie needed a sequel</a> were compounded by reasonable concerns over whether a new director would really get what makes <em>Inside Out</em> one of Pixar’s most touching and memorable features.</p>
<p id="Pp8dEx">But <em>Inside Out 2</em> doesn’t fall into the usual sequel traps of piling on more of the same thing the original was doing, just bigger, louder, and with extra emphasis on whatever fans loved most vocally the first time out. It authentically forwards the story of <em>Inside Out</em>’s Riley Andersen, giving her new problems to face both internally and externally, and finding clever ways to expand the innovative metaphorical language from the original movie.</p>

<p id="a6dWTt">There are new emotions, new mental-landscape puns, and new parts of Riley’s head to explore, but the most important element is that her story feels believable — not just on the fantasy level, but as a moving and occasionally heartbreaking narrative about being a teenager. Director Kelsey Mann (<a href="https://www.polygon.com/2020/2/24/21150811/onward-movie-review-pixar-animation-disney-chris-pratt-tom-holland-octavia-spencer"><em>Onward</em></a> writer and <a href="https://disney.fandom.com/wiki/Party_Central"><em>Party Central</em></a><em> </em>helmer) and his filmmaking team pull that off with surprising deftness, making this sequel Pixar’s most emotionally powerful movie of the past 15 years. </p>
<p id="cWd145"><em>Inside Out 2</em> reunites with Riley (Kensington Tallman) at age 13, about to move on from middle school with her best friends and hockey teammates Grace (Grace Lu) and Bree (Sumayyah Nuriddin-Green). Riley hopes they’ll all make the high school team so they can continue playing together. The initial five emotions from the first movie — Joy (Amy Poehler), Sadness (Phyllis Smith), Anger (Lewis Black), Disgust (Liza Lapira, replacing Mindy Kaling), and Fear (Tony Hale, replacing Bill Hader) — have found a solid, cooperative balance in Riley’s head. Bossy, controlling Joy has learned to give space to Sadness and the others, and all of them work collegiately to express Riley’s response to the world.</p>
<p id="dkDagy">But when Riley finds out she’s been assigned to a different high school than Grace and Bree — and hits puberty at the same time — a new set of emotions arrives and starts taking over: Anxiety (Maya Hawke), Envy (Ayo Edebiri), Ennui (Adèle Exarchopoulos), and Embarrassment (Paul Walter Hauser).</p>

<p id="K7gpak">The fact that Joy absorbed the lessons of <em>Inside Out</em> so thoroughly that she initially welcomes these unpleasant-sounding newbies is just one of countless tiny grace notes that makes the transition from original to sequel feel seamless — and wryly funny at the same time. The writers (Mann, <em>Inside Out</em> co-writer Meg LeFauve, and Dave Holstein) know exactly what audiences expect the arrival of Anxiety in a teenage girl’s brain to do to her equilibrium, and keeping Joy and the others cheerfully naive about the threat sets up some early tension, at least for adult viewers.</p>
<p id="sEdPsO">The ensuing mayhem follows a common path for recent Disney and Pixar movies: There isn’t exactly a villain here, just self-serving intentions, fear disguised as love, and Anxiety living up to her name. But that’s plenty enough to launch a fairly frantic action movie full of big conflicts and small comic elements.</p>
<p id="AVhhmg"><em>Inside Out 2 </em>raises the exact same questions the first movie raised, and skims past them in the exact same ways: Are all these emotion characters driving Riley, or are they responding to and reflecting her experiences and needs? Just as in the first movie, the metaphor falls apart if you look at it too closely, or if you read it as literal text, where a floppy orange Muppet-creature living in this teenager’s brain can drive her into an otherwise unjustified panic attack just by pressing too many buttons on a console. The broad message, that emotions can be messy, conflicted, complicated, and contradictory, comes across clearly enough, but it reads most convincingly if you accept the reality of Riley’s external experience rather than <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23762172/elemental-pixar-cars-comparison">demanding a close read on the details</a> of how her internal architecture operates.</p>

<p id="0a9aJa">But <em>Inside Out 2</em> makes that easy enough for anyone but the most determined sticklers. It’s a manic film, constantly rushing from one visual pun and one dramatic face-off to the next, but the architecture, where Riley has to decide what’s important to her and who she wants to be, is not only sound and thoughtful, it’s constructed with real empathy. Much like <em>Turning Red</em>, another recent Pixar film that <a href="https://www.polygon.com/22996520/turning-red-panda-meaning">puts a symbolic face</a> on a <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/22962242/turning-red-review-pixar-disney-plus">teenage girl’s physical and emotional experience</a>, <em>Inside Out 2</em> is full of passion and empathy, letting the audience in on Riley’s inner struggle without always painting her as the hero, even in her own story.</p>
<p id="5q6jaO">The specifics of that conflict will land better for some viewers than others. Riley’s attempts to navigate whether to stick with her best friends or cling to a thread of friendliness from the cool-girl hockey champ at her new school do raise some logistic questions that have nothing to do with the body-mind interface. (Why is hockey team captain Val Ortiz [Lilimar] so endlessly supportive to one random awkward middle schooler that she’s willing to alienate her own besties just to hang out with Riley during every moment of hockey camp?) </p>
<p id="yGXFiI">But like the best Pixar films, <em>Inside Out 2</em> makes the actual emotions palpable and painful, in ways that go beyond most kid-friendly animated movies. Riley’s anxiety and desire to be liked, her guilt over her interactions with her friends, her fear of the future and of not being good enough for the team — they all play out vividly on her face, not just in the complicated, character-packed, symbolic world in her head. If anything, she feels more like a real, developed person in this sequel than she did throughout most of <em>Inside Out</em>, up to the film’s memorable finale. As her inner world gets more complicated, her outer world does too. (And vice versa.) </p>
<p id="tW1WbQ">Pixar purists are certainly justified in feeling some anxiety about the way the studio has been committing to sequels and franchises lately, and how many of its more recent originals have lacked the old emotional magic that gave the studio its reputation and produced a stream of indelible, memorable hits. But <em>Inside Out 2</em> is a good sign that the company is moving back toward its core strengths. It’s a sequel to a movie that didn’t call for one, and an expansion of a setting that took a lot of its initial power from the simplicity of its setup: five emotions, locked in conflict over an unprecedented new challenge. But the new movie earns its place in the Pixar pantheon with its creativity, its craft, and its heartfelt writing. It’s almost enough to make <em>Inside Out 3: The College Years</em> seem like a promising pitch. </p>
