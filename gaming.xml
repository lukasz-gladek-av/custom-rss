            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/24295956/the-rise-of-the-golden-idol-review-pc-playstation-xbox-netflix-mobile<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>The Case of the Golden Idol</em> was <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23433741/the-case-of-the-golden-idol-review-pc">a rewarding series of point-and-click murder mysteries</a> that became one of my favorite games of 2022. And while I felt there was more story to explore about the titular golden idol, I wasn’t sure if a potential sequel could live up to its clever puzzles and fascinating, slowly unfolding story. Turns out, I had nothing to fear: <em>The Rise of the Golden Idol</em>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/10/24267159/the-rise-of-the-golden-idol-release-date-trailer">the newly launched sequel</a>, easily surpasses the original by improving on just about everything.</p><p>At its core, <em>Rise</em> is a very similar game to <em>Case</em>. The new game takes place in the 1970s, around 200 years after the events of the original, and each of <em>Rise</em>’s cases drops you into a specific moment in time, typically during or shortly after a murder. You’re tasked with solving what’s going on. To figure that out, you first have to click around the scene to discover relevant words and names that get saved in a menu. Then you use those words to solve puzzles within the case, like the names of the individuals in a scene, a description of how the murder happened, or even things like how to interpret parts of a dance or who won a game show.&nbsp;</p><div><figcaption><em>Here’s an example of how you use the words you find to solve elements of a case.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Playstack / Color Gray Games</cite></p></div><p>It’s a clever system. Clicking around to collect all of the words forces you to scrutinize everything that’s going on, and having to fill in the blanks means you really have to think about how elements of the scene might be connected. I’ve come to think of it like an <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/27/24278619/wilmot-works-it-out-review">elaborate jigsaw puzzle</a>: while the scattered elements may seem like a lot to tie together, as you slowly solve the disparate elements of the puzzles within cases, it’s easier to figure out how they connect.</p><p>There are more layers, too, as you have to solve puzzles encompassing the events of entire chapters, which typically have three or four cases within them, to be able to move on to the next one. A few recurring characters will pop up across chapters, meaning the game is able to tell a holistic story by forcing you to understand their actions across a bunch of different scenes. (You don’t need to have played <em>Case</em> to understand the events of <em>Rise</em>, though there are a few tidbits that will be familiar to fans of the first game.)</p><p>The system isn’t perfect. Like with <em>Case</em>, if you’re off the mark after you’ve slotted in words for a specific puzzle, <em>Rise</em> will tell you if your guess is incorrect or if you have two or fewer words in the wrong place. Usually, knowing that I was close meant I could reexamine my assumptions and tweak a few words to get things right. But as I also did with <em>Case</em>, if I couldn’t figure out the two or fewer incorrect words on my own, I would just brute-force a bunch of guesses until I got things right.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Rise</em> has some tough puzzles, but so far, I’ve been able to solve all of them without turning to an online guide like I had to do with the final few cases of <em>Case</em>. <em>Rise</em> also has an improved hint system that offers up to three hints for a specific part of a case, and often, checking those pointed me in the right direction when I was stuck. I’d also recommend having pen and paper handy to write things down, especially because some cases scatter details across multiple areas. And if you can play with someone else, that helps, too — my wife saw a bunch of things that I completely missed.</p><div><p><cite>Image: Playstack / Color Gray Games</cite></p></div><p>I will warn you that the game can be grotesque. <em>Case</em> generally erred on the side of creepy with its old-school pixel art style, but <em>Rise</em> looks more like a painting, and that means you’ll be seeing slightly more realistic dead bodies. Scenes and characters move in short loops, which makes them feel alive but also means you’ll see certain uncomfortable movements over and over again. The first case opens with a man actively strangling somebody else; another shows a person getting electrocuted. If you have a fear of birds, there’s one case you’re really not going to like. But like a good scary movie, those twisted scenes are part of what makes the game compelling. Every time I started a new case, I was always eager to see what terrible things I’d come across.</p><p>I’m not quite done with <em>Rise.</em> After more than 15 hours, I’m on one of the last of the game’s 20 cases, and this one is taking me a couple of days to muddle through. I think the eventual thrill of figuring it all out will be worth the pain, though, as there’s nothing better than that lightbulb moment of slotting the final word into the right place of the puzzle. And even when I’m done with all 20 cases, there will be <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fnews%2Fapp%2F2716400%2Fview%2F4478360632965464065">four DLC packs</a> to look forward to next year — perhaps there’s even more that we don’t know about the mysterious golden idol.</p><p><small>The Rise of the Golden Idol<em> is now available for PC, PlayStation, Xbox, Nintendo Switch, and on mobile with a Netflix subscription.</em></small></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

    <div>
        

        <p>By analysing the hacker's digital footprint, the Japanese megacorp was able to hunt them down.</p>

            <p>Nintendo reportedly hunted down an alleged Switch pirate by tracking their reddit posts.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, after putting <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gary-bowser-gets-more-than-three-years-in-jail">Switch pirate Gary Bowser behind bars</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-emulator-yuzu-shuts-down-as-creator-agrees-to-pay-nintendo-24m">targeting emulator software Yuzu</a>, Nintendo resumed its fight against the modded console business with new lawsuits, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-war-against-switch-piracy-ramps-up-with-two-fresh-cases">including one against James "Archbox" Williams</a>, who was the main moderator behind r/SwitchPirates.</p>
<p>As reported by <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/how-nintendo-found-archbox-switch">Game File</a>, it seems Williams was located after Nintendo commissioned a law firm to investigate "freeshops" or online repositories for pirated Switch games.</p>

<p>By analysing Williams' past posts online - including one from reddit user "archbox" in 2015 that was very complementary about Midwestern University's optometry clinic - the firm helped the Japanese company "succeed in linking Archbox with at least two Nintendo accounts for an individual named James Williams".</p>
<p>And because Williams seemingly used the same email address to get repairs for their Nintendo Switch, staff at Nintendo's Product Lifecycle Management group was able to find his shipping address.</p>
<p>Once it had acquired Williams' address, Nintendo sent a cease and desist, after which Williams initially agreed to "comply and cooperate" with Nintendo's demands. However, Williams then went dark and failed to show up at court, defaulting judgement in favour of Nintendo.</p>
<p>ICYMI, last week <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-sues-streamer-who-said-he-could-broadcast-its-pirated-games-all-day">Nintendo filed a new lawsuit against a streamer who broadcast 10 pirated games ahead of their release</a>, including <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom">The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mario-and-luigi-brothership">Mario &amp; Luigi: Brothership</a>.</p>
<p>When Nintendo moved to shutdown streamer Jesse Keighin's streams via copyright notices on YouTube, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/twitch">Twitch</a>, and other streaming platforms, he reportedly told them he "could do this all day" and had "a thousand burner accounts".</p>
<p>Nintendo further alleges that as well as broadcasting unreleased games, he also instructed others on how to obtain pirated games via "circumvention devices" Nintendo calls "trafficking".</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Ubisoft has responded to reports about its upcoming Animus Hub.</p>
<p>Yesterday, Eurogamer reported that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-leak-looks-to-show-free-battle-pass-rewards">leaked Assassin's Creed Shadows images have surfaced</a> showing a selection of free battle pass rewards for Ubisoft's upcoming blockbuster. Assassin's Creed has never offered a battle pass before, and there were no official details on how this will work.</p>

<p>In a message posted on social media, Ubisoft called the rumours "inaccurate", saying it wanted to "clarify" issues after it learned "inaccurate rumours have been circulating online regarding the upcoming Animus Hub (ex-codename Infinity)".</p>
<p>The post adds "all the rewards available in the Animus Hub will be entirely free, there are no paid subscriptions or paid battle pass featured in the Animus Hub, and players will have access to regular content [and] missions at no extra cost".</p>
<p>The post ended on promising to "unveil more details about it closer to the launch of Assassin’s Creed Shadows".</p>
<p>As our report yesterday intimated, there's nothing specified in the rumours that hasn't been done in an Assassin's Creed game before. But interestingly, nothing in Ubisoft's new statement contradicts our report from yesterday, either.</p>

<li>Fixed playback of the the post-credits movie at the end of Episode One and the intro movie at the start of Episode Two.</li>
<li>The achievements for Episode One and Two have been added to Half-Life 2. When launching the game it will attempt to read data from installed standalone Episodes to re-grant those duplicated achievements.</li>
<li>Hammer: Show detail sprite preview on non-displacement surfaces.</li>
<li>Hammer: Fixed bug where orphaned entities added additional data on each map load.</li>
<li>Hammer: Fixed the ability to render cubemaps.</li>
<li>Hammer: Increased many limits for BSP data. Models 1024 -&gt; 2048, Brushes 8192 -&gt; 16384, TexInfo 12288 -&gt; 16384,&nbsp;TexData 2048 -&gt; 8096,&nbsp;DispInfo 2048 -&gt; 8096.</li>
<li>Added save_transition_music convar that allows streaming music to continue to play in between level transitions.</li>

<ul aria-label="Notes">
<li>The previous version of the game has been archived to a publicly visible Beta branch named “steam_legacy”, with the description “Pre-20th Anniversary Build.” If a mod or feature is behaving in an unexpected way, you may need to run this archived build until the issue is resolved in the default build.</li>
<li>With the Episodes and Lost Coast now contained within Half-Life 2 itself, we’ll be reducing the visibility of the standalone versions on the Steam Store. The old standalone applications will remain available to ensure community projects that rely on them still function properly but they will now appear within the Tools menu on your Steam Library.</li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally, Valve has also announced that it will be reprinting Raising The Bar, an expanded edition of the original book that was first printed in 2004. This second edition of Raising The Bar adds new concept art from Episode One and Episode Two, plus a look at the never released third episode. It will be released in 2025.</p>

		<p>The tail end of every year is full of single days that are blown way out of proportion. Halloween has houses covered in cobwebs and guarded by pumpkins for weeks before and after, Christmas has a two month run up (if not longer), and even Thanksgiving in the US has morphed into a scattershot ‘Friendsgiving’ gathering ahead or instead of the actual holiday.</p>
<p>But we all know what comes directly after Thanksgiving, and that’s Black Friday, and the need to ring up sales has Black Friday sales kicking off all over the place already – it’s the Friday with by far the biggest presence on the calendar. I’ll admit, I’ve got my eye out for a few choice purchases as gifts, biding my time until the best deals arrive…</p>

<p>In December, the grand final of the PUBG Mobile Global Championship will unravel in London, England. With a $3 million prize pool up for grabs, this has snatched the record for the most valuable esports event to ever be held in the United Kingdom. It’s the first time the tournament has taken place in the UK, and fans are <strong>excited</strong> to say the least.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-big-money">Big Money</h2>



<p>The PUBG Mobile Global Championship is one of the most valuable tournaments in the modern esports calendar. A single event will rarely reach such epic proportions in terms of a prize pool, and few tournaments come close to the $3 million pot that this game boasts.</p>



<p>During the event, 49 teams will compete for a chance at snatching the coveted PMGC trophy. In 2023, it was IHC Esports that walked away with the prize. The tournament was a roaring success in 2023, with a whopping peak viewership of 980,123 users being recorded, which decimates most competing events.</p>



<p>In recent years, the concept of mobile-based esports tournaments has skyrocketed in popularity. It’s estimated there at 2 billion mobile gamers worldwide, and many of them invest time and effort in games like Free Fire and PUBG Mobile.</p>



<p>While the United Kingdom’s gaming expo scene is crumbling, the esports ecosystem across the region remains relatively solid. In the last few years, we’ve seen the likes of the League of Legends World Championship, the Halo Championship Series, a BLAST R6 Major, and the Rocket League Championship Series all make their way into the region.</p>



<p>Will you be watching the PMGC unfold in London? Let us know in the comments.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/twitch-ad-revenue-drop-streamers-adpocalypse/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/twitch-streamers-see-ad-revenue-plummet-amid-platform-struggles.1037436/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/twitch-ad-revenue-drop-streamers-adpocalypse/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>If you’ve heard the term ‘adpocalypse’ in the streaming world and haven’t got a clue what it means, you’re not alone. Recently, it was revealed that some Twitch streamers are suffering immeasurably from plummeting ad revenue rates, and nobody knows why. On the streaming platform, some users have reported a drop in ad revenue of as much as 95%.</p>



<p>This adpocalypse came on suddenly and has impacted some of Twitch’s biggest streamers, some of whom were picking up thousands of dollars a month through ad revenue. They’re now looking at just a few hundred dollars, and on their end, nothing has changed.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-taken-for-granted">Taken for Granted</h2>



<p>Admittedly, this is the bread and butter earnings for some Twitch streamers. On social media, clips have surfaced showing users complaining about their ad revenue drops, <a href="https://x.com/zachbussey/status/1857455706376450514" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">such as Lacy</a>, who stressed that his $10,000-a-day ad revenue stream has dropped to around $2,000 a day.</p>



<p>That’s still <strong>far, far </strong>more than the average worker earns, but for someone who has built a way of living out of those earnings, it could be devastating. Twitch allowed them to secure the bag in this way, and then without warning or forethought, the rate of earnings has been slashed immeasurably.</p>



<p>Imagine if your place of work suddenly cut your salary by 80% without telling you – that’s effectively what’s happening here. Sure, the creators still have subscriptions, bits, and other donations, but it’s not <strong>good</strong>.</p>



<p>One streamer, TheStockGuy, revealed that he’s disabling ads on his streams because the returns aren’t worth the disruption. He was reporting a 95% drop in earnings – one of the most significant examples of the adpocalypse we’ve seen.</p>



<p>Twitch has yet to comment on why ad revenue is plummeting – I’ve reached out for a statement in the meantime.</p>



<p>Do you think streamers needed their earnings adjusted, or is this an unfair change from Twitch? Let us know in the comments.</p>

<p>Dying Light 2 is available on PS Plus this month as a free game, but Techland has gone one step beyond that provision and added a series of PS5 Pro-focused enhancements to the game. One of the best open-world zombie games ever made has just gotten better with these recent changes – read on to find out what they are.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-the-end-of-the-world-looks-gorgeous">The End of the World Looks Gorgeous</h2>



<p>With a PlayStation 5 Pro, users can soak up several key advantages, from boosted resolutions to enhanced frame rates. There’s a sizeable processing boost under the hood of the PS5 Pro, and many developers have leant on that to strengthen their games. </p>



<p>It was recently revealed that 2022’s Dying Light 2: Stay Human will be added to PS Plus this month as a free game. It was then announced by Techland, the game’s developer, that PS5 Pro enhancements are also inbound.</p>



<p>This includes:</p>



<ul>
<li>Enhanced graphics settings (Balanced, Resolution, Performance, Quality)</li>



<li>Increased base resolution</li>



<li>Improved shadows, screen-space reflections, and sub-surface scattering</li>



<li>Better weather (including fog)</li>
</ul>



<p>Dying Light 2 already looked phenomenal, boasting one of the best apocalyptic environments in recent years, but this latest round of changes takes things to an entirely new level. If you’re a PlayStation 5 Pro owner and you want to pick up a copy of Dying Light 2 when it goes live on PS Plus, I’d recommend doing so.</p>



<p>In recent news, it was revealed that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dying-light-the-beast-one-million/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dying Light: The Beast</a> had surpassed one million wishlists. Are you looking forward to the next instalment in the popular post-apocalyptic series? Let us know in the comments.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/never-before-seen-half-life-2-episode-3-gameplay-footage-and-ice-gun-revealed-in-new-documentary<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">"Are we allowed to cry in this documentary?"</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Half-Life: Episode 3 remains one of the great what-ifs in gaming history. Originally set to follow on from Episode 1 and 2, its cancellation instead left the series dangling on a cliffhanger it never directly resolved. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now, on the occasion of Half-Life 2's 20th anniversary, Valve has opened up about its development in a brand-new documentary that shows never-before-seen work-in-progress footage, a brand-new Ice Gun, and a raft of new concept art. You can see the gameplay segment from the documentary in the video below.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Among the details shown in the video, Episode 3 would have been set in the Arctic, and it would have focused on Alyx as a companion character. Aside from the Ice Gun, the footage shows a blob-like enemy that could split into multiple parts. According to the documentary, the team had complete a "collection of playable levels in no particular order" and expected to be able to release the game within a year or two.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In addition to the new gameplay footage, writer Marc Laidlaw, founder Gabe Newell, and others also talk frankly about why it was never released, ultimately chalking it up to a lack of compelling new ideas and other reasons. At one point Laidlaw jokes, "Are we allowed to cry in this documentary?"</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>We could have shipped it. It wouldn't have been that hard</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The reason for Episode 3's cancellation has been the subject of much discussion over the years, not the least because Episode 2 ended on a grim cliffhanger. In an <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/valve-explains-why-half-life-2-episode-3-was-never-made">interview with IGN</a> shortly before Alyx's release, Valve level designer Dario Casali described it partly as an issue of scope screep. Laidlaw would later reveal the plot in a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2017/08/25/half-life-2-episode-3-potential-plot-revealed-by-series-writer">story called "Epistle 3,"</a> featuring "Gertie Freemont" and "Alex Vaunt" — plays on Gordon Freeman and Alyx Vance.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/11/16/half-life-2-20th-anniversary-documentary-1-53-41-screenshot-1731720807178.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Half-Life 2: Episode 3 would have been set in the Arctic and featured an Ice Gun. Image source: Half-Life 2 Documentary.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">It's possible to detect a lot of regret over the decision not to go through Episode 3. At one point Laidlaw jokes, "Are we allowed to cry in this documentary?" Others talk about how Episode 3 probably could have been released in hindsight. Newell says, "We could have shipped it. It wouldn't have been that hard. My personal failure was being stumped. I couldn't figure out why Episode 3 was pushing anything forward."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Valve finally released Half-Life Alyx in 2020, sending <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/half-life-alyx-ending-explained">the story spinning off in a new direction</a>, but many fans remain wistful about Half-Life: Episode 3 (not to mention the long lost Half-Life 3). Now, 20 years after its release, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/half-life-2-20th-anniversary-update-includes-developer-commentary-improved-graphics-and-a-2-hour-documentary">Valve is celebrating Half-Life 2</a> amid unconfirmed rumors that a <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/half-life-3/leaks-deadlock-details" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">new game is in the works</a>. In the meantime, it's worth watching the entire documentary, which delves deep into Half-Life 2's fraught development.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Image source: Half-Life 2 Documentary / Valve</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Kat Bailey is IGN's News Director as well as co-host of Nintendo Voice Chat.

It’s an in-depth peek behind the curtain at a pivotal moment in gaming history, but the festivities don’t stop there.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Half-Life 2 owners can also now enjoy a new update that adds everything from additional content to ironed out wrinkles. This includes access to the original Episode One and Episode Two expansions, which have been bundled into to the base experience at no additional cost. Valve adds that it reassembled the original Half-Life 2 team to provide commentary tracks for the entire game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Steam Workshop support and Steam game recording are just two more bonuses that have been added to help celebrate Half-Life 2’s 20th anniversary, with even more included in the form of general touch-ups and fixes.

Now, 20 years later, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/220/HalfLife_2/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/220/HalfLife_2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Valve has updated the landmark first-person shooter</a></span> and added new features, fixed old bugs, improved some visuals, added more options, and integrated the Steam Workshop into the classic game. And if you somehow don’t own <em>Half-Life 2</em>, well, it’s free to grab over the weekend. </p><p>Perhaps the biggest new addition to the 2004 shooter <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.half-life.com/en/halflife2/20th&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.half-life.com/en/halflife2/20th" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">as part of this update</a></span> is that <em>Lost Coast </em>(a small free side-game), <em>Episode 1, </em>and <em>Episode</em> <em>2</em> are now included as part of the full <em>Half-Life 2</em> package, so you can play all of these games within <em>Half-Life 2. </em></p><p>Speaking of <em>Lost Coast</em>, ever since Valve launched that small experience it has included developer commentary in its games. However, <em>Half-Life 2</em> lacked this feature, and that’s now been rectified with this update. Valve got the ol’ gang back together and recorded nearly 4 hours of commentary for the FPS. They also did a big documentary about <em>Half-Life 2</em> and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/preview/valve-reveals-early-gameplay-of-canceled-half-life-2-ep-1851701011?rev=1731712110253&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/preview/valve-reveals-early-gameplay-of-canceled-half-life-2-ep-1851701011?rev=1731712110253">spilled the beans on<em> Episode 3</em>'s development and cancellation, too</a></span>. </p><p>Another big feature included in this update, alongside improved gamepad controls and auto-aim, is the inclusion of Steam Workshop support. This will make it easier than ever to add new levels, guns, and mods to the extremely moddable PC game. There’s basically 20 years’ worth of mods out there that can now be migrated to the Workshop and made easier than ever to access. </p><p>Valve also updated a ton of smaller parts of <em>Half-Life 2</em>, including fixing old bugs, adding new graphical options for blood splatter, tweaking HDR settings, and more. Thankfully, if you don’t like these changes or have a mod that relies on the old version, Valve isn’t removing the OG <em>HL2 </em>from Steam. You can still download it and enjoy all your mods and old memories. </p><p>And best of all, Valve has made <em>Half-Life 2 </em>(which now includes all the <em>Episodes</em>) totally free for the next three days. You have until November 18 to grab <em>Half-Life 2</em> on Steam for $0 and you should. It’s one of the best games ever made, and the mods alone will keep you busy for the next 20 years.</p><p>If this seems familiar, that’s because back in November 2023, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/new-half-life-1-free-update-patch-25-steam-deck-maps-pc-1851031923?_gl=1*426pk2*_ga*MzQzNjkwNDM2LjE2NDY2NjQ1NzQ.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTczMTY4MTIxMC4xMTYuMS4xNzMxNzEzMDY2LjYwLjAuMA..&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/new-half-life-1-free-update-patch-25-steam-deck-maps-pc-1851031923?_gl=1*426pk2*_ga*MzQzNjkwNDM2LjE2NDY2NjQ1NzQ.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTczMTY4MTIxMC4xMTYuMS4xNzMxNzEzMDY2LjYwLjAuMA..">Valve did a similar big Anniversary update for the original<em> Half-Life</em></a></span> to celebrate 25 years of the franchise.

Xbox CEO Phil Spencer is aware of these challenges, and they're one reason he's "not the biggest fan" of committing resources to licensed games.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking with the <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Game File newsletter</a>, Spencer talked about some of the "complexities" that come with making licensed games, especially when it comes to putting them on subscription or streaming services.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"We’ve seen it in racing games that have to get delisted, because you lose certain licenses,” Spencer said. “So I'm always very careful, if we're going to take on a license, that we're doing it for creative reasons, [that] the team has a goal around what they want to do.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While Spencer didn't name it explicitly, Ubisoft has cited "licensing constraints" as <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/delisting-the-crew-makes-sense-preventing-it-from-ever-being-played-again-does-not">one of its reasons for delisting The Crew</a>.

The story is, to me, one of the strongest parts of that game—the way you feel like you're Indiana Jones from a first person perspective," Spencer said. "So it's clear that's something they wanted to do. But, for us, given the [intellectual property] that we have that we own. I'm a big fan of us using the IP that we haven't even revisited.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for whether or not the Indiana Jones license might eventually expire, Spencer said, "I feel great about our partnership with Lucas and Disney, all up, on that. They've been good partners. We're obviously doing <a href="https://substack.com/redirect/957d65d2-2817-46a5-b955-b8e42dc5318f?j=eyJ1IjoiMzhuNGhrIn0.DY9ADcho0T-iaJ3fvV9HkxOuhC3fWjfEONzJi0UR2ck" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Blade with Arkane Lyon</a> with them.

<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/half-life-2">Half-Life 2</a> is officially 20 years old this weekend, and to mark the occasion Valve has released a special anniversary update, bundling in a brand-new documentary, commentary, the previously separate Episodes 1 &amp; 2, and more. Oh, and the game's free to keep over the next few days.
</p>
<p>
Valve's seminal shooter sequel, which charts the continuing adventures of bespectacled scientist Gordon Freeman and his deeply erotic love affair with a prising tool, released into the world on 16th November, 2004. It was immediately heralded as a classic of the genre, and Valve has done everything in its power not to release a numbered sequel since.
</p>
<p>
But now, 20 years on, Valve is in a celebratory mood, and - much as it did when the original Half-Life <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/half-life-gets-25th-anniversary-update-with-restored-content-new-maps-and-more">reached the big two-five last year</a> - it's released a special anniversary update introducing bonus material, previously separate bits of DLC, and a whole range of tweaks.

<figcaption>Or you can watch the Half-Life 2 documentary right here.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YCjNT9qGjh4" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>
There is, for starters, a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YCjNT9qGjh4">new documentary</a> created by Secret Tape. "It's about a lot more than just the making of a game," explains Valve in its announcement. "Running out of money. Getting hacked, and an early version being leaked online. Being sued by our publisher. Trying to build Steam. It's all in there!" It's also unearthed a number of old presentations from across Half-Life 2's development, which it's <a href="https://www.half-life.com/en/halflife2/20th">shoved on its anniversary website</a>.
</p><p>
Additionally, Valve has recorded a brand-new Half-Life 2 commentary for its latest update, and it's also permanently bundled <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/half-life-2-episode-one">Half-Life 2: Episode One</a>, Episode Two, and Lost Coast - all previously available separately - together with the base game. That's alongside the addition of integrated Steam Workshop support, meaning everyone can browse and download player-created content from directly within the game.
</p>
<p>
But that's still not the end of it. Valve says every map has been looked over by its level designers to "fix longstanding bugs, restore content and features lost to time, and improve the quality of a few things like lightmap resolution and fog". It's also added new graphics settings meaning players can now choose between the original launch day blood and fire effects or those introduced in Half-Life 2's later episodes; it's updated gamepad controls and aim assistance, and it's also possible to play with only the highest detail models in High Quality mode. Full patch notes, if you're curious, can be <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/220/view/5914976662778213744?l=english">found in Valve's announcement</a>.
</p>
<p>
All the above is now available as part of Half-Life 2's free 20th anniversary update on Steam. And if you don't already own a copy of Half-Life 2, it's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/220/HalfLife_2/">free to download and keep on Valve's platform</a>, provided you pick it up before Monday, 18th November at 6pm in the UK.

The update includes new commentary, quality-of-life features, Steam Workshop support, and more. However, perhaps the most exciting thing to come out of this big <em>Half-Life 2</em> celebration is a new two-hour documentary from Valve detailing the development of the famous first-person shooter and its follow-up episodes. And yes, they talk about<em> </em><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/15-years-ago-this-month-valve-announced-half-life-2-e-1846995929&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/15-years-ago-this-month-valve-announced-half-life-2-e-1846995929"><em>Half-Life 2 Episode 3</em></a></span>, the game that never came to be despite millions of players begging Valve to make it. </p><p>Here’s the documentary if you haven’t watched it yet: </p><p>At the end of the doc, after talking about <em>Episode</em>s<em> 1 </em>and <em>2</em>, numerous people who worked on <em>Half-Life 2</em> and its episodes then began talking about  <em>Episode 3</em>. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://youtu.be/YCjNT9qGjh4?t=6817&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://youtu.be/YCjNT9qGjh4?t=6817" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Valve was apparently working on an ice gun</a></span> that would let players create icy structures, pathways, and barricades during combat. Valve was also working on a blob-like monster that could split into multiple parts and go through vents and chain-link fences. However, this was all very early stuff, with <em>HL2 </em>engineer David Speyrer suggesting they were only about six months into development before plans changed. </p><p>“Even into <em>Episode 3</em>, I still don’t know what that would have been if we’d built it because it hadn’t been built,” said series writer Marc Laidlaw. </p><p>“That was the the feeling of excitement. Of something I can’t even imagine is going to happen with this team. I was not imposing a top-down, ‘This is what we must do to tell our very important tale,’ you know? It’s like, ‘Oh, we have new features, how do we use [them]? What kind of story can we do with these now?’” </p><p>According to Speyrer,<em> Episode 3 </em>was set in the Arctic—something that previously released concept art had confirmed—and he explained that the episode would focus on the missing Borealis ship referenced in both the <em>Portal</em> and <em>Half-Life</em> franchises.</p><h2 id="h42651"><a id=""></a><em>Episode 3 </em>was stopped after six months of development</h2><p>After six months of development, Speyrer says that <em>Episode 3</em> was still a “collection of playable levels in no particular order” and some story beats. He theorized that after another six months, they would have reached a “critical mass of mechanics” and at that point they could start really putting the game together for release in about a year or two, depending on “how ambitious” the team got.</p><p>Of course, that didn’t happen.<em>&nbsp;</em>In the documentary, <em>Half-Life</em> 2 devs explain that they had started to run out of things to do with the tools and features they had developed. At one point, they reference Arkane’s canceled Ravenholm episode, and how the team was struggling to do new and fun stuff with the<em> Half-Life 2</em> toolbox and engine. </p><p>“Arkane was building the Ravenholm game and even they were having trouble doing cool new stuff with this toolset, and if those guys can’t figure out a bunch of cool stuff to do with this, I think we’re running out of fuel,” said Laidlaw.</p><figure id="" data-id="7d91e32a1675fdf550ce45a874419e01" data-recommend-id="image://7d91e32a1675fdf550ce45a874419e01" data-format="jpg" data-width="3840" data-height="2160" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Valve / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="7d91e32a1675fdf550ce45a874419e01" data-recommend-id="image://7d91e32a1675fdf550ce45a874419e01" data-format="jpg" data-width="3840" data-height="2160" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>So everyone at Valve focused on finishing up <em>Left 4 Dead</em> and put <em>Half-Life Episode 3</em> on the back burner. And then, they felt like they had waited too long to come back and finish it.</p><p>“<em>Left 4 Dead</em> came out great,” said Speyrer. “But it took long enough—and this is  the tragic and almost comical thing about it—was it took long enough that then, by the time we considered going back to Episode 3, the argument was made like, ‘Well, we missed it. It’s too late now, you know,’ and ‘We really need to make a new engine to continue the <em>Half-Life</em> series’ and all that.”</p><p>Now, Valve feels like that was a mistake, with Speyrer adding: “In hindsight [it was] wrong. You know, we could have definitely gone back and spent 2 years to make<em> Episode 3</em>.” </p><p>Toward the end of the documentary, Valve boss Gabe Newell says that <em>Half-Life</em> <em>Alyx</em>’s ending was a somewhat “self-critical realization” that they needed to move forward with the story. </p><p>“I think that<em> Half-Life</em> represents a tool we have and promises made to customers to capitalize on innovation and opportunities to build game experiences that haven’t been [seen] previously, and I think that there are no shortage of those opportunities facing us as an industry right now,” is the final message in the doc from Newell.</p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>STALKER 2: Heart of Chornobyl is just around the corner after being recently announced as <a href="https://wccftech.com/stalker-2-is-finally-gold-so-delay-concerns-should-be-put-to-rest/">going Gold</a>. The game's development has taken a relatively long time due to the tragic war between Russia and Ukraine, which has led to the Ukrainian developer having to take drastic measures by delaying the game and working on the title during an active warzone. While plenty of people are excited about STALKER 2: Heart of Chornobyl, Russia is potentially trying to silence the game and the company.</p>
<p>The ongoing war led to significant delays, and some of the developers in GSC Game World had to relocate to a new office in the Czech Republic. This is something that they spoke about in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=28CITqxwNz0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the documentary</a> that they released alongside the Microsoft Team, which helped them produce and discuss the story of creating STALKER 2: Heart of Chornobyl in an active warzone.</p>
<p>STALKER 2: Heart of Chornobyl is looking like it has the potential to be banned in Russia due to anti-Russian propaganda. A Russian official has said that the game could face a total ban in Russia if the game is found to "justify terrorism" or if the Russian government finds that the content in the game is deemed to be "extremist" or "anti-Russian." While the game wouldn't be sold in Russia if this were true, people in Russia would still be able to purchase the game using digital means.</p>
<p>However, <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/stalker-2-could-be-banned-in-russia-if-it-justifies-terrorism-russian-official-says/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">as covered by VGC</a>, legal advisor Mikhail Mushailev has stated that Russians who are found to be purchasing the game via a VPN or using any non-direct means could be seen as supporting a "hostile force." Mushilev has also said that if any Russians are seen purchasing the game, it could potentially meet the requirements for the Russian government to define the purchase as terrorism.</p>
<p>This year, Russia also took control of Chornobyl, which is where STALKER 2 is set to take place. However, after a month of control over Chornobyl, they were driven out, and the area was controlled by Ukraine again. At the moment, it's uncertain about what will happen with STALKER 2 in Russia and whether it will be banned. It's likely the decision will come out once the game has officially been released globally.</p>
<p>STALKER 2: Heart of Chornobyl is set to be released on November 20 for PC and Xbox Series X|S, and will also be available on Game Pass.</p>

In addition to Steam Workshop support directly within the game, Valve has fixed bugs and restored some content, added new graphics settings, updated gamepad controls, and a whole lot more. You’ll also be able to get the game for free <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fapp%2F220%2FHalfLife_2%2F">on Steam</a> through November 18th at 1PM ET. After that, it will cost $9.99.</p><p>Valve is also now including the Episode One and Episode Two expansions with the base game. They’ll be accessible from the <em>Half-Life 2</em> menu, and Valve says that “you will automatically advance to the next expansion after completing each one.” You’ll also be able to access the Steam Workshop within the Extras menu, which means you’ll no longer have to leave the game to enable mods.</p><p>Valve says it also made massive updates to <em>Half-Life 2</em>’s maps, which will fix “longstanding bugs, restore content and features lost to time, and improve the quality of a few things like lightmap resolution and fog.” There’s a new option to play with the original launch day blood and fire effects as well, and Valve has updated <em>Half-Life 2</em>’s gamepad controls to “match” <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/11/17/23965754/half-life-25th-anniversary-update">last year’s <em>Half-Life 1</em> anniversary update</a>.</p><p>If you want to access the older version of <em>Half-Life 2</em>, that’s still an option: you’ll just have to roll back to “a publicly visible Beta branch named ‘steam_legacy’” and grab the “Pre-20th Anniversary Build,” Valve says.</p><p>Like with the 25th anniversary celebration for the original <em>Half-Life</em>, Valve has also released a free documentary about <em>Half-Life 2</em> that you can <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YCjNT9qGjh4">watch for free on YouTube</a>. Here’s what you can expect, according to the documentary’s YouTube description: “we’ve gotten members of the HL2 team back to talk about the game’s development, how we almost ran out of money, what it was like when we were hacked, what happened when we were sued by our publisher, the birthplace of Steam, and much more.”</p><p>In addition to the documentary, Valve has shared videos of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CaHtOISsLT4">old</a> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wU4yPEFXzo0">demos</a> of the game — including one that it planned to bring <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8CoMdbnJwvE">to E3 2022</a> but decided not to show at the last minute. Valve added 3.5 hours of new developer commentary within the game, too.</p><p>And the company is printing an expanded second edition of the <em>Raising the Bar </em>book about the game’s development, which includes “the <em>Half-Life 2</em> development story, with never-before-seen concept art from Episode One and Episode Two, along with ideas and experiments for the third episode that never came to be.” The book will return to print in 2025.</p><p>Maybe soon we’ll get <em>Half-Life 3</em>? Maybe?</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

That doesn’t mean that Denis Villeneuve’s vibes-heavy take on Frank Herbert’s novels isn’t helpful context for what’s going on in <em>Prophecy</em>, though. In fact, a working knowledge of the lore referenced in the movies provides a decent foundation for understanding the characters, motivations, and plot devices at work in the <em>Game of Thrones</em>-style prequel.</p><p><em>Dune: Prophecy</em> focuses on a religious order in Herbert’s universe called the Bene Gesserit. A group of women with mystical powers, the Sisterhood tries to manipulate political events from behind the scenes, leading all the way up to Villeneuve’s adaptations. Their plans take epochs to unfold and also revolve around, uh, eugenics. The whole thing not only offers an interesting through-line for exploring the <em>Dune</em> universe in deeper detail, but it’s also fertile soil for political intrigue, Machiavellian maneuvering, and heady sci-fi concepts that are cool to see play out on screen. Here’s a quick primer on what you need to know to catch up.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="4bf50ca72d9e59f19611ed874f55f2ab" data-recommend-id="image://4bf50ca72d9e59f19611ed874f55f2ab" data-format="png" data-width="1057" data-height="595" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Mother Superior puts Paul's hand in a box.

Successful graduates go on to become Truthsayers for powerful families and Houses throughout the galaxy while those who show special promise are referred to as Reverend Mothers. They also try to enlist the would-be wives of emperors and other royalty in their school in order to increase their reach and power. </p><p>Beyond generally being the witches of the Dune universe, the Bene Gesserit’s larger goals is to bring about the birth of a super-being called the Kwisatz Haderach through thousands of years of genetic research and carefully arranged marriages. This ultimately ends up being Timothée Chalamet’s Paul Atreides in the movies.

It’s not really important <em>how</em> Reverend Mothers are able to do it, just that they can. </p><p>Of course, with great power comes great responsibility, and using the Voice <em>too</em> much would clearly bring all of their finely crafted long term plans crumbling down.

Otherwise known as “Melange,” people can use it to get high and then do complex navigation computations to pilot ships through space. No spice, no space travel, which is why it’s always at the center of every major power dispute in <em>Dune</em>. </p><p>If Spice were plentiful, it would simplify things. Instead, Spice can only be harvested from the poop of massive alien worms on a giant desert planet called Arrakis. Much geopolitical turmoil ensues as rival powers negotiate and fight with one another over the Spice trade. Melange doubles as status symbol for rich families and a psychedelic that can help the Bene Gesserit and others tap into the more mystical side of Dune’s universe. </p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="d6ca8ed6bcc8a64d0196f1d934490f35" data-recommend-id="image://d6ca8ed6bcc8a64d0196f1d934490f35" data-format="jpg" data-width="1500" data-height="843" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A giant worm appears in the desert.

Dune’s political empire, the Corrino Imperium, relies on individual houses to harvest spice from the planet’s surface, but the threat of worms and attacks by the indigenous Fremen mean the honor also comes with a lot of costs. Whoever is supposed to be in charge of the planet gets a ton of spice but is also constantly getting attacked and killed.</p><p>This makes Arrakis a consistent pain point in Dune’s delicate political order. In the movies, the planet becomes a staging ground for Paul Atreides rebellion against the Imperium and his messianic journey to terraform it into a paradise that would destroy all spice in the process. At the start of <em>Dune: Prophecy, </em>as in the start of the movies, the big question is how to get the military resources together to subdue Arrakis.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="0baa81ae1d35badd36cedbdb308b2cf3" data-recommend-id="image://0baa81ae1d35badd36cedbdb308b2cf3" data-format="jpg" data-width="1200" data-height="675" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Dave Bautista's Rabban is dressed in black alongside other Harkonnen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Dave Bautista's Rabban is dressed in black alongside other Harkonnen." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Warner Bros.</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="0baa81ae1d35badd36cedbdb308b2cf3" data-recommend-id="image://0baa81ae1d35badd36cedbdb308b2cf3" data-format="jpg" data-width="1200" data-height="675" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Dave Bautista's Rabban is dressed in black alongside other Harkonnen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>In Villeneuve’s movies, House Harkonnen is portrayed by Stellan Skarsgård’s Baron, Dave Bautista’s Rabban, and Austin Butler’s Feyd-Rautha. They are all bald, pale, and sociopathically ruthless. Arrakis has been theirs to rules and harvest for generations, leading to a giant scandal when the emperor takes the planet away and gives it to House Atreides, Harkonnen’s sworn enemies.  </p><p>The Harkonnen reside on Giedi Prime, a not particularly beautiful planet made more grim by all of the over-industrialization and colosseums. While the Baron and his brood got rich from all the spice, it wasn’t always thus for House Harkonnen. The events that kick-off <em>Dune: Prophecy </em>left it very much in exile by the other powerful houses over its betrayal in the <em>Matrix</em>-like rebellion against “thinking machines” called the Butlerian Jihad. It’s basically the catalyst for everything else that happens in <em>Dune</em>.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="bbb42fb95bc003c48d532ea71a4baf75" data-recommend-id="image://bbb42fb95bc003c48d532ea71a4baf75" data-format="jpg" data-width="1080" data-height="607" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Leto Atreides and Gurney prepare to go to Arrakis.

While Paul’s journey begins in the ashes of House Atreides, during the era <em>Dune: Prophecy</em> takes place in it is very much still burgeoning power center among the rest of the Houses. </p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="e8b326882e73c0e44cf6671d33795aaa" data-recommend-id="image://e8b326882e73c0e44cf6671d33795aaa" data-format="jpg" data-width="998" data-height="562" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Javier Bardem's Stilgar guides the Fremen in Dune Part II.

With complex computers outlawed following the Butlerian Jihad, ships rely on Spice-snorting pilots to calculate complex trajectories and get massive, faster-than-light fleets where they need to be. Though only mentioned in passing in the <em>Dune</em> movies, like when Paul threatens to cut off the entire Spice trade, it’s an important countervailing force to the rest of <em>Dune</em>’s political players. </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/aftermath-hours-podcast-anniversary-favorite-moments<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Just in case you’ve somehow managed to avoid getting beaten over the head with this fact these past few days – perhaps you’re very good at dodging – <a href="https://aftermath.site/aftermath-first-birthday-sale" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Aftermath is now one year old</a>! Like proud parents, we won’t shut up about it, so we decided to indulge ourselves a bit more on the latest episode of <a href="https://aftermath.site/tag/aftermath-hours" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Aftermath Hours</a>.</p><p>We begin the episode by discussing the <a href="https://aftermath.site/aftermath-business-lessons-learned-tips" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">lessons we’ve learned</a> in our first year at the school of hard knocks that is small business ownership. Then we segue briefly into some news – specifically, our own feature about how <a href="https://aftermath.site/freelance-video-game-journalism-rates" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">freelancers are propping up games journalism</a> (and getting paid dogshit for it) and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/13/24295556/video-game-developer-strike-zenimax-microsoft" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Zenimax workers’ recent strike</a> against Microsoft’s restrictive return-to-office policies – before talking about games we’ve been playing, including <em>Star Wars Outlaws </em>(surprisingly great),<em> </em><a href="https://aftermath.site/metaphor-refantazio-documentary-atlus-archipel-making-of" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Metaphor: ReFantazio</em></a> (expectedly great), and <em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</em> (well…).&nbsp;</p><p>After that, at the behest of listeners, it’s back to anniversary stuff, like our favorite moments from this year and games we were playing when the site launched that we still haven’t wrapped up. Also, we design an Aftermath-themed Sonic The Hedgehog OC – and give him a gun.&nbsp;</p><p>You can find this week's episode below and on <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/7qtlX6MNeEoyNuHBU0chUJ?si=a2f12b75911f43cb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Spotify</a>, <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/aftermath-hours/id1727407094" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Apple</a>, or wherever else you prefer to listen to podcasts. If you like what you hear, make sure to leave a review so that by the time our second anniversary rolls around, we can bring our Sonic The Hedgehog OC to life (or <a href="https://aftermath.site/aftermath-2024-finances-subscription-plans" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pay ourselves a livable full-time wage</a>).&nbsp;</p><p>Here’s an excerpt from our conversation:</p><p><strong>Luke: </strong>There was a point where <a href="https://aftermath.site/welcome-to-inside-baseball-week" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">we ran Inside Baseball Week</a>, and we got a big spike in subscribers. Up until then, it had been not touch and go, but it had been like “Is this gonna work or not? Do people actually want this or not?” It wasn’t quite nailed down yet. But after Thursday or Friday of that week, it was like “We’re doing this! This has worked. People are into this. We’ve done work we’re proud of. This is actually coming together.”&nbsp;</p><p>We came to this conclusion at a staff meeting that week. It wasn’t me just having an isolated thought. We all kind of talked about this. It was really cool. We were like “Man, it’s working. That’s amazing.” So that’s my fondest memory. It was really stressing me out for almost a year between setting the site up and seeing that happen. So it was good to have my fears removed and replaced with good feelings.</p><p><strong>Chris:</strong> It didn’t feel bad before then; it just didn’t feel as certain.</p><p><strong>Luke: </strong>We just had no idea what we were doing. That seemed to also crystalize. We all had to sit down, plan a week, and write appropriate content for the week. It kind of helped sharpen our focus for the site. Because we’d just been flailing around until then, like “Oh, let’s just do a blog! And a review!” Everything was sloppy. Individual pieces weren’t sloppy, but our strategy for it – how we packaged it and put it on the website and spaced our posts out and stuff was a mess. After Inside Baseball Week, we felt like we were a lot sharper with that kind of stuff. We’ve obviously still got a long way to go and a lot to learn. The website is far from perfect, but that was the week where it stopped being chaos and started actually feeling like a website we could work at and do really good stuff at for a long time to come.</p><p><strong>Chris: </strong>For me, I will say that is probably my [favorite], but my second is that there’s a couple of times where I published something that I didn’t know if people were going to like or care about, and then a lot of people cared about it. This is personal instead of the aggregate, but that helped me. I try to write about things that people would like to know about, and in the case of <a href="https://aftermath.site/true-lies-4k-uhd-blu-ray-james-cameron-peter-jackson-park-road-post" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the James Cameron piece</a>, that felt fairly nice. It was just like, a whole bunch of people here really want to know about this shit. Finding your beat and figuring out what an Aftermath piece is – even with you guys, figuring out what your quintessential Aftermath tone is – has always felt really good.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> This is recency bias talking, but mine was… so, you know, I collected all those quotes for our post that we published yesterday, <a href="https://aftermath.site/aftermath-first-anniversary-you-are-all-way-too-kind-thank-you" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cool People Like Website Despite Its Many Flaws</a>, and it’s basically a bunch of nice people saying things about our website that are very, very kind. Receiving a message from Ed Zitron for that piece [is my favorite moment]. His blurb for that piece is so insanely kind and really heartfelt and beautiful.&nbsp;</p><p>I’m not gonna lie: When I first read his response to my little prompt, it brought tears to my eyes. I wept as a result of Ed saying nice things that were both personal and professional and that really resonated with me. Being appreciated – having the website feel so seen for what it is, which is a combination of our various passions and us being people who seek to on one hand do good work, but on the other hand be vulnerable and empathetic, trying to do this work in a way that centers human beings – and having someone crystalize it on that level meant a lot. It made me feel like we’ve really done this right.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Chris:</strong> I think part of it is that it’s something we needed at Kotaku but never really had. It’s something we needed for a sense of self, that we’re getting now. And I think part of that is just how the site is structured – that we’re able to talk about these things, the freedoms that we have. You get a chance to do things right this time in ways that fulfills your soul.</p><p><strong>Luke: </strong>To flesh that out, just so people understand, working at Kotaku from the mid-2010s onward, the only time you would hear from people was to receive constant, daily, quite vitriolic and threatening abuse – to the point where I had to make my phone silent, I had to remove all my family members from Facebook, I had to keep my address a secret. You would receive death threats. You would receive threats of physical violence, and people going after you on YouTube and Reddit and stuff constantly.&nbsp;</p><p>You would spend years and years internalizing abuse. That was the only thing you would receive publicly. And then your best work on the site would just go down as “Oh yeah, that’s another good Kotaku post. I read Kotaku every day. Next.” You don’t realize how much that fucks you up until you step away from it and go to a job like this, and people say nice things about you. You don’t know how to process it, in a way. It’s like “What do you mean someone’s saying something nice about me?”</p><p><strong>Chris:</strong> It’s like being a shelter dog.</p><p><strong>Luke:</strong> It really is. It’s those before-and-after TikTok videos. We used to be the snarling street dog that only got hit with newspapers. Now someone’s taken us into their home and actually fed us and brushed us, and we’re really happy. It’s cool to be the happy dog.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Shadow runs, jumps, and homing-attacks his way through enemies and obstacle courses with the same exhilarating velocity he always has. Unfortunately, I don’t think it has many memorable levels, which could be part of the reason <em>Shadow Generations </em>doesn’t have any levels explicitly based on the game. But at its core, <em>Shadow the Hedgehog </em>is just as good as any other 3D <em>Sonic </em>game. Whether that sounds like a good time to you or not depends on how you feel about Sonic’s 3D outings in general, but I think <em>Shadow the Hedgehog </em>is an alright one of those.</p><p>The coolest thing about <em>Shadow the Hedgehog </em>is how it handles multiple endings. There’s a visual novel-esque quality to its story structure as Shadow goes through multiple timelines, learning different truths and ultimately coming to different conclusions about his past. <em>Shadow the Hedgehog </em>is one of the last gasps of <em>Sonic</em>’s AMV-bait era before things got sanded down after <em>Sonic ‘06</em>. The game gets into melodramatic explorations of Shadow’s self-concept, questions whether one’s value is defined by one’s past, and wonders if it’s possible to forge a new future, and all of this is structured around a flowchart. There are multiple endings exploring these themes, and which one you get is determined by good, evil, and neutral missions you can complete during the standard run-and-jump <em>Sonic</em> levels. Your choices will lead you to different conclusions, though in a more abstract way than you might be familiar with from narrative-driven games in which the way things play out often feels like a direct result of your actions. Here, it’s more like doing a bad thing relegates you to the lower end of the level select screen, leading you to one of 10 possible conclusions.</p><figure id="" data-id="e65888898e1296615c6aec0843ca9430" data-recommend-id="image://e65888898e1296615c6aec0843ca9430" data-format="jpg" data-width="550" data-height="400" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Shadow holds a gun in one hand while Knuckles walks beside him." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Shadow holds a gun in one hand while Knuckles walks beside him." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Sega</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="e65888898e1296615c6aec0843ca9430" data-recommend-id="image://e65888898e1296615c6aec0843ca9430" data-format="jpg" data-width="550" data-height="400" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Shadow holds a gun in one hand while Knuckles walks beside him." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Some of these can result in Shadow finding out half-truths about himself. He might believe himself to be an android clone of the original hedgehog who debuted in <em>Sonic Adventure 2</em>, or become the right hand to his alien invader father Black Doom. <em>Shadow the Hedgehog </em>does have a true conclusion, but its use of multiple endings and choice-driven game design, which allows fans to explore the deep (if overly convoluted) backstory of the antihero, is a really compelling technique for a series that was getting increasingly mature during the mid-2000s. It feels like the natural evolution of the alternate story paths <em>Sonic </em>games had been utilizing during that era.</p><p>The problem is, that maturity takes a hard left turn into early-2000s edginess. Shadow wields firearms in this game and they are incredibly frustrating to use, lacking any kind of lock-on or aiming mechanic. Enemy health is scaled, too, so you’re wasting time if you don’t whip out a Glock or a rocket launcher to deal more damage than your homing attack can deliver. While not inherently “edgy,” Shadow can also drive vehicles, most of which are slower than he is on foot, in what feels like a half-assed effort to emulate more “mature” games like <em>Grand Theft Auto</em>. Occasionally these vehicles are used to greater effect, like the mech Shadow can pilot that lets him jump high through some of the platforming segments, but most of the time these cars and bikes are just hanging out in different levels with no incentive to use them. Surprisingly enough, the vehicles were kept around for <em>Sonic ‘06</em>, where they<em> </em>felt more integrated into the level design, at least sometimes. But even so, the weapons and vehicles came off like obligatory distractions from the decent core <em>Sonic </em>gameplay.</p><p>But the weirdest, most memeable thing about <em>Shadow the Hedgehog </em>is easily that characters swear. Soundbites like “Where’s<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np8SjpJYGeU&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=np8SjpJYGeU" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> that damn fourth Chaos Emerald</a></span>?” with its incredibly forced delivery, are still iconic within the <em>Sonic </em>fandom, and I still have vivid, embarrassing memories of playing the game in my dad’s living room and seeing him wince every time Shadow said “damn” when I got hit by an enemy. Fearing your parent might take a game away from you if he thinks the mascot character is a potty mouth is as good a motivation as any to get good.</p><figure id="" data-id="4e9da401d9d410524550c1c9f7a9ada1" data-recommend-id="image://4e9da401d9d410524550c1c9f7a9ada1" data-format="jpg" data-width="550" data-height="400" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Shadow hovers as he fires a pistol." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Shadow hovers as he fires a pistol." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Sega</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="4e9da401d9d410524550c1c9f7a9ada1" data-recommend-id="image://4e9da401d9d410524550c1c9f7a9ada1" data-format="jpg" data-width="550" data-height="400" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Shadow hovers as he fires a pistol." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>All of these creative decisions were made in service of an older audience, and in the moment, they felt forced and made <em>Shadow the Hedgehog </em>a worse game. But looking back on it, I still find a lot to love in the spaces between the nonsense. Shadow was always the emotional center of the franchise for me, so learning more about his ever-evolving lore through a video game story structure that was completely new to me as a kid was worth the online ridicule I endured for saying I liked the game. Crush 40’s theme song for the game, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NucG0kD3pkg&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NucG0kD3pkg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">“I Am…All of Me”</a></span> is still an S-tier track in a series full of them. And you can’t tell me it didn’t feel incredible to use Chaos Control and dash through entire levels at maximum velocity.</p><p>In retrospect, <em>Shadow the Hedgehog </em>is a pretty fascinating reflection of a moment in both the <em>Sonic </em>franchise and pop culture at large. The people behind <em>Sonic </em>were pressing the gas on the anime-inspired sentimentality that had been working for them, in the face of continued critical pressure to revert the series to a simple mascot platformer only focusing on the blue blur. But angst, edginess, and perceived “mature” storytelling were “in” during the mid-2000s. Plenty of franchises were trying to make their “gritty” pivot, like the <em>Jak </em>series and <em>Prince of Persia</em>, and some were more successful than others. Shades of this moment in the franchise are found in <em>Shadow Generations</em>, and it is certainly far more effective at capturing those ideas than <em>Shadow the Hedgehog</em>. But even given my criticisms, I l<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/11-bad-games-well-defend-mass-effect-andromeda-ps4-1850274471&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/11-bad-games-well-defend-mass-effect-andromeda-ps4-1850274471">ook back on Shadow’s first game with fondness</a></span>. It had ideas and it ran with them, even if where it ran was headfirst into a wall. As the Year of Shadow comes to a close, I’m glad to see Shadow getting his due with that newer game, one I can recommend without all the caveats.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Following Sony's seemingly premature announcement earlier this week it'll be <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ps5-slim-digital-edition-discounted-by-70-in-us-ahead-of-christmas">knocking $70 off the PS5 Slim Digital Edition in the US</a> ahead of Christmas, reliable leaker Bilbil-kun has claimed similar discounts are coming to Europe soon - including a PSVR2 price cut of a whopping €200.
</p>
<p>
Writing for <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/black-friday-2024-des-remises-interessantes-attendues-sur-les-consoles-ps5-chez-plusieurs-marchands-59662">Dealabs</a>, Bilbil-kun (who has a proven track record when it comes to PlayStation leaks) says Sony's European Black Friday discounts will run from Friday, 22nd November, until 12th December, with both the PS5 Slim Standard Edition and PS5 Slim Digital Edition being reduced by "at least" €75 during that time. That may rise to €80 in some countries.
</p>
<p>
If the claims are accurate, that means it'll be possible to pick up a Standard Edition PS5 Slim for €474.99 instead of usual €549.99, while the Digital Edition will fall to €374.99 from €449.99.

<p>
That's not the end of the PlayStation discounts, however; Bilbil-kun <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/black-friday-2024-offrez-vous-le-casque-playstation-vr2-a-un-prix-jamais-constate-en-france-59664">also reports</a> a massive €200 price reduction of for PSVR2, bringing it down to €399.99 from the usual €599.99. Additionally, the PSVR2 <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/horizon-call-mountain">Horizon Call of the Mountain</a> Pack, which includes the VR headset and a Horizon Call of the Mountain code, will fall from €649.99 to €399.99. There's no word of UK pricing for any of this yet, but it shouldn't be long before all is revealed.
</p><p>
All this, of course, follows Sony's recent announcement its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ps5-console-sales-top-65m-as-astro-bot-sells-15m-copies-in-first-month">console hardware has seen a significant drop in sales</a>, falling to 6.2m units sold compared to the 8.2m shifted in the same quarter last year. Whether the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2024-playstation-5-pro-weve-removed-it-from-its-box-and-theres-new-information-to-share">recently launched PlayStation 5 Pro</a> will help gives those numbers a notable boost remains to be seen. "The truth is, the standard PS5 is still the best choice for most people," Digital Foundry's Richard Leadbetter said in a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2024-sony-playstation-5-pro-review-across-the-board-improvements-but-is-it-really-worth-the-money">recent appraisal of the new console</a>, "but for the core enthusiast looking for the best possible experience, the Pro option is there for you, albeit with a substantial premium."

		<p>Microsoft has kicked off their Xbox <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/black-friday">Black Friday</a> sale, with the expected discounts across consoles, accessories and, of course, on a huge number of digital games.</p>
<p>This is a big time of year for console purchases, and so Microsoft has cut $50 off select <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/xbox-series-x">Xbox Series X|S</a> consoles over the next few weeks.</p>


<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/consoles/xbox-series-x" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">$50 off Xbox Series X – 1TB</a> – Until 23rd November</li>
<li><a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/consoles/xbox-series-s" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">$50 off Xbox Series S – 512GB</a> – From 21st November to 2nd December</li>
</ul>
<p>That will bring the standard Xbox Series X down to $450, and the base Xbox Series S down to $250. We’ll have to wait and see how these offers are extended outside the US, but that’s a fairly straightforward discount.</p>
<p>Xbox controllers are also set to be discounted, with a select range of gamepads getting $10 knocked off, making them $50 between 21st November and 2nd December, and then 13th December through 22nd December.</p>
<p>From 28th November through 5th December, Xbox Design Lab controllers will offer free engraving for all purchases.</p>

<p>So far, so standard, so hopefully the games on discount will spark more joy. Over 1,000 games on both Xbox and PC are discounted.</p>
