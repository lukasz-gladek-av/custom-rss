		<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/11/14/c-smash-vrs-review/">C-Smash VRS</a> was easily one of the best games from the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/psvr-2">PlayStation VR 2’s</a> launch window. Taking the cult classic arcade and Dreamcast game Cosmic Smash, it shifted the perspective, giving us a minimalist blend of Breakout and real-life Squash for a compelling VR sports game.</p>
<p>But shouldn’t everyone be allowed to smash cosmically? Not just the relative few with fancy hats? Enter C-Smash VRS: New Dimension, a fresh launch and free update coming at the end of September that will bring back flat-screen play and arcade delights alongside all the VR goodness of before.</p>
<p><iframe title="C-Smash VRS New Dimension - Date Announcement Trailer | PS5 &amp; PS VR2 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nMxDfVt-dG4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>



<p>New Dimension feeds a lot more of the original Cosmic Smash back into C-Smash VRS, specifically with the shift back to a third-person camera – there’s both a dynamic tracking cam and a pulled-back fixed camera – and seeing your avatar race back and forth as you position yourself to slap the ball back down the arena.</p>

<p>Going hands-on back-to-back with a classic arcade cabinet, there’s a very familiar feel between them, with the way that your avatar is animated in running, jumping and hitting, the ease and accessibility of timing shots, and more. However, New Dimension has added a few extra flourishes and moves on top of that. Whether they’re new moves or old, it’s pretty cool to see your character pulling off wall jumps, seeing the spinning flourish of a power shot, or a last ditch dive to reach a ball that’s heading outside of your hitting sweet spot.</p>

<p>Every mode from C-Smash VRS is available to play in New Dimension, whether it’s the Journey mode through strings of action puzzle stages, the endless Infinity mode, co-op or head-to-head multiplayer. Through all of the multiplayer modes, one of the key factors to New Dimension is that this bridges the divide between VR and flat-screen play.</p>
<p>This isn’t quite the first time that this has been done in VR gaming, since we have cross-play in digital board games like Demeo, or more significantly with racing games like Gran Turismo 7 and flight games. However, C-Smash VRS: New Dimension is possibly the first time that we’re dealing with two completely different styles of motion and control.</p>
<p>GT7 or Star Wars Squadrons might give VR players a greater awareness of their surroundings, but you’re still fundamentally fixed in the cockpit and have the limits of your vehicle. New Dimension has VR players with a first-person view and full motion tracking of your arms going up against the abstracted arcade action of the flat-screen game.</p>

<p>It’s a really fascinating problem, but one that RapidEyeMovers and Wolf &amp; Wood are very close to getting just right. We went through the gamut of head-to-head multiplayer options, myself playing on TV in London against Wolf &amp; Wood’s Ryan Bousfield up in Newcastle, and had some good fun and close matches, despite the completely different controls.</p>
<p>A few things stood out the more that I played, though. Depending on your preferences, C-Smash VRS is perhaps a bit too lenient with allowing you to press the hit button well before the ball gets back to you. You do want to try to position yourself and time the button press to get the best power and control, but there’s a lot of give here and your avatar can almost always make that diving hit to dribble the ball back down the court.</p>
<p>At the same time, there’s more advanced moves that have much, much less margin for error. A jump shot is very easy to end up with whiffing at clean air, and cool as it looks, so can a wall jump shot. When playing against another person who’s actively aiming for the edges of your reach, these are pretty important to master, and hopefully the final product can bring these two extremes a bit closer together.</p>

<p>VR versus TV play works wonderfully well and feels like it should be well balanced. A VR player will need to have better natural hand-eye coordination than a TV player, especially when trying to pinpoint a shot at a small target, but that physical control gives a higher ceiling for play.</p>
<p>Coming out on 26th September, C-Smash VRS: New Dimension is set to be all things to fans of hitting balls with rackets. This is probably the game that fans of the original would have hoped for, a modern successor with a bunch more modes, block types and power ups, but with familiar gameplay and feel. And you can always still pop a VR headset on as well, now hopefully with more people to play with online.</p>

The event was held in Hawaii this year, so its closing ceremony took place late at night for many people around the globe. . The Pokémon Company made a few lowkey announcements at the end of the tournament, and spoilers: there was no news on the upcoming RPG <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-predictions-mega-evolution-kalos-1851316456&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-predictions-mega-evolution-kalos-1851316456"><em>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</em></a></span>. But if you like the card game, the MOBA, or <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/pokemon-go-fest-2024-niantic-necrozma-1851592588&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-go-fest-2024-niantic-necrozma-1851592588"><em>Pokémon Go</em></a></span>, there were a few exciting announcements.<br></p></div><div><p>The mobile capture and collection game <em>Pokémon Go </em>got two announcements during the closing ceremony, but one was easily the bigger deal. Developer Niantic teased that Dynamaxing, the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/pokemon-battle-best-gimmicks-mega-evolution-tera-types-1850736746&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-battle-best-gimmicks-mega-evolution-tera-types-1850736746">battle gimmick</a></span> from <em>Pokémon Sworld </em>and <em>Shield</em>, is finally coming to <em>Pokémon Go</em>. These temporary transformations allow Pokémon to grow in size like a Kaiju, with some getting original forms called Gigantamax that are distinct from a typical Dynamax form. The feature was teased with a live-action trailer showing what appears to be a Dynamax Pokémon descending upon a beach.<br></p></div><div><p>Also during the <em>Pokémon Go </em>segment, Niantic revealed Morpeko, the Galar region’s <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/pokemon-pikachu-raichu-pichu-clones-mimikyu-pachirisu-1850622444&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-pikachu-raichu-pichu-clones-mimikyu-pachirisu-1850622444">Pikachu clone</a></span>, is coming to the app “soon.” <em>Pokémon Go </em>still hasn’t fully rolled out Generation VIII’s Pokédex, though it has sporadically released critters from the <em>Sword </em>and <em>Shield</em> games over the years. Hopefully Dynamax and Morpeko are signs that more are on the way.<br></p></div><div><p><em>Pokémon TCG Pocket</em> was <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-mobile-android-ios-1851289803&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-mobile-android-ios-1851289803">revealed earlier this year</a></span> as a new way to play the <em>Pokémon Trading Card Game </em>on your phone. Now, the app has a release date. The Pokémon Company confirmed <em>TCG Pocket </em>will launch on the Google Play Store and App Store on October 30. You can preregister on either storefront from your phone or tablet.<br></p></div><div><p>One of the highlights of the showcase was the reveal that Owner’s Pokémon cards, which include Pokémon that are trained by a specific trainer from the games or anime, are about to make a proper return. They’ll be officially known as Trainer’s Pokémon cards, include art of their respective trainer, and can only be evolved into an evolutionary card from that line. For example, the Lt. Surge’s Pikachu card can only evolve into Lt. Surge’s Raichu. The first wave of these cards was teased with an animated trailer featuring cards like Lillie’s Clefairy, Marnie’s Grimmsnarl, and a gorgeous full art of N’s Reshiram.<br></p></div><div><p>The Pokémon Company revealed the next three Pokémon set to join the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/pokemon-unite-is-as-simple-and-approachable-as-a-moba-g-1847185517&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-unite-is-as-simple-and-approachable-as-a-moba-g-1847185517"><em>Unite</em></a></span> roster. First up will be Armarouge, who will join the MOBA’s roster as an Attacker on September 12. The fire/psychic-type seems to specialize in area-of-effect attacks. Next up in October will be the mythical Pokémon Darkrai, which has the power to put enemies to sleep and strike them down while they’re incapacitated. Finally, Psyduck will join in November, acting as a support character. It looks like this will be a Pikachu situation, in which Psyduck doesn’t evolve throughout a match like other characters. So if you were hoping to play as its evolved form Golduck, that doesn’t look like it’s in the cards.<br></p></div><div><p>The final announcement rounding out the closing ceremony was the reveal of the location for the next two Pokémon World Championships. The tournament will be held in Anaheim, California in 2025, and will stay in California in 2026 and head to San Francisco. The Pokémon Company has held the event annually since 2004 (with the exception of 2020 and 2021, which were canceled due to the covid-19 pandemic), and it has been almost exclusively held within the United States. Worlds 2013 was held in Vancouver, London hosted the 2022 show, and, surprisingly, 2023 was the only year the event was held in The Pokémon Company’s home country of Japan. I’m glad to see it return to the continental US, at least. Now I may actually get to make the trip.<br></p><hr><p>Ultimately, it was a light series of announcements this year, as I know a lot of folks were hoping to hear more about <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-kalos-war-az-switch-teaser-trailer-1851290552&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-kalos-war-az-switch-teaser-trailer-1851290552"><em>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</em></a></span>. The Kalos-based RPG was announced at the Pokémon Day Presents in February, but was only teased with a concept trailer. So we still don’t know a lot about the game beyond that it will take place entirely in the metropolis of Lumiose City.<br></p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/total-war-pharaoh-dynasties-impressions-release<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><a href="https://aftermath.site/im-so-tired-total-war" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">One of the first blogs I ever wrote for this website was about <em>Total War: Pharaoh</em></a>, and how the underbaked and hugely disappointing release had pushed me to the very brink when it came to one of my favourite franchises. Nine months later, I have some good news: I am here to eat some shit.</p><p>My criticisms of <em>Pharaoh </em>at launch were not isolated, nor were they made in a vacuum; while Creative Assembly enjoyed some recent well-deserved success with the main <em>Warhammer </em>games, and the mega campaign made available as a result, fans had still been simmering away for a while, upset at everything from<a href="https://thesouthernnerd.com/2021/05/30/fans-incensed-when-ca-announces-end-to-three-kingdoms-dlc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> the supposed abandonment of <em>Three Kingdoms</em></a> to<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/totalwarhammer/comments/15torey/official_blog_post_from_ca_regarding_the_shadow/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> deeply unpopular <em>Warhammer </em>DLC pricing and plans</a>.</p><p>To then release <em>Pharaoh</em>, a game so underwhelming I called it <em>Total War: Going Through The Motions</em>, was for many a final straw.<a href="https://www.twcenter.net/forums/showthread.php?818995-An-Open-Letter-to-CA-on-the-State-of-Total-War-(Oct-2023)" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Some folks were mad</a>! And more importantly, I guess, more folks simply didn't care, with <em>Pharaoh </em>enjoying nowhere near the critical success <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sega-issues-financial-warning-after-sluggish-sales-of-sonic-superstars-endless-dungeon-and-total-war-pharaoh" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">or sales performance</a> that previous historical <em>Total Wars</em> had enjoyed.</p><p>While Creative Assembly could have just ridden this out--keep milking <em>Warhammer </em>for DLC and slowly release <em>Pharaoh </em>DLC in the hopes <em>someone </em>would like it--what they've actually done in response is remarkable. Because what they've done is tear up what looks like a years-long release schedule of expansions and downloadable content and just...dumped it all on players in one big package.</p><p>For free.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Total War: PHARAOH - Dynasties Overview" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6erHiCuh1tQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Called <em>Total War: Pharaoh Dynasties</em>, this update was released late last month. It adds two whole new regions to the map (it shipped with just one), doubling the total size of the game. It doubles the number of unique factions available to play as, adds a dynastic system (your leaders can now die and have their children inherit) and a ton of new units. Every single thing I just mentioned could have been at least paid DLC, if not a dedicated expansion, but it's all been rolled up and dropped in everyone's lap in one big download, and it hasn't cost anyone a cent.</p><p>Game director Todor Nikolov says of <em>Dynasties</em>:</p><blockquote><p><em>From the outset of our design journey on Total War: PHARAOH, our vision has always been to deliver a grand-scale recreation of the turbulent Bronze Age Collapse; one brimming with historical intrigue, authentic representations of iconic civilisation, and a sandbox theatre that allows you to rewrite the course of human history</em>. <em>We’re very proud of what we’ve achieved and whilst this will be our final content addition, we hope it serves as a love letter that encapsulates our continued passion for this wonderful age. Thanks for your support.</em></p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p>By "thanks for your support" I think he means "we're sorry", and when he says it'll be the final content addition, it sure sounds like this was years worth of releases all dropped at once.</p><p>On the one hand, this highlights the very worst of modern, big-budget video games. If the plan really was to release such a limited game in 2023 and then drip-feed so much of everything else to players over the next year or two, then that plan can fuck right off. It's bad enough when Paradox do it, but I think most people's criticism of that approach is slightly unfair, since Paradox's base games often ship in a pretty complete state already. <em>Pharaoh</em>, as so many said at the time, felt like half a <em>Total War</em> game. Because, turns out, it was!</p><p>On the other hand, though, that's a strategic decision made above most people at Creative Assembly's heads. Those responsible for making <em>the game itself</em> can now have their work surveyed in full, and in a remarkable turnaround from November 2023, I think that work is <em>fantastic</em>.</p><p>While I still have reservations about the time period--"Bronze Age collapse" sounds cool but the primitive units available to the player kinda limit the tactics you can employ as a result--<em>Pharaoh</em> now boasts easily the series most accomplished strategic section, with a ton of cool features like outposts (which can be customised to add benefits to your region and slow down defenders) and a court + religion overlay that really helps each corner of the map feel like a distinct ethnic region.</p><p>And the bigger maps, extra cultures and fog-of-war frontiers help make the game feel <em>vast</em>, and not in the bland, tedious way that <em>Rome 2</em> or <em>Three Kingdoms</em> were, but more like <em>Empire</em> or <em>Warhammer</em>. <em>Dynasties'</em> world is one to be explored and adventured in, starting small in your own region with your own familiar people before venturing out into the wider, wilder world.</p><p>Basically, in the space of one update this has gone from being one of the worst<em> Total Wars</em> of all time to one of the best, all because we got to see the full game as it was intended to be seen, not held back and drip-fed over months and years. Does it make up for the years of frustration and disappointment fans have been dealing with across the entire <em>Total War</em> series? Probably not! But does it make up for months of frustration and disappointment surrounding <em>this</em> game? You bet.</p><p>I have no idea if this is indicative of Creative Assembly's release strategy going forwards, or if it's just an emergency, one-off decision made in response to <em>Pharaoh </em>bombing last November. I fear it's the latter, but man, wouldn't it be great if the company<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/totalwar/comments/1edi3bo/tw_pharaoh_dynasties_sits_at_a_92_user/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> could look at the unprecedented turnaround <em>Pharaoh</em> has enjoyed here</a>, and the resulting swing in people's appreciation of the game and the studio, and realise that we <em>can </em>go back. That even in 2024 and beyond,<a href="https://aftermath.site/helldivers-2-flamethrower-nerf-controversy-live-service" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> when it feels like every other game on the planet is feeling the pressure to keep releasing content forever</a>, it's possible to do the most old-fashioned thing imaginable: just release the whole game at once and make people happy.&nbsp;</p><p>(<strong>Bonus note</strong>: if you're into <em>Total War </em>and want to hear me and some people much smarter than me talk about it, I was on last week's episode of 3MA specifically to chat about <em>Dynasties</em>, <a href="https://www.idlethumbs.net/forums/topic/15748-three-moves-ahead-619-total-war-pharaoh-dynasties/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">and you can check it out here</a>).</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The primordial creator Marda brought forth the land of Mardias. In ages past a mighty battle rocked this land, when Elore, the king of the gods, fought three malicious deities: Death, Saruin and Schirach. After a long and drawn-out struggle, Death and Schirach were sealed away and rendered powerless, with the final deity Saruin also trapped through the power of the <a title="Series > Fate [64 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/series/fate">Fate</a>stones and the noble sacrifice of the hero Mirsa.</p><p>Now 1,000 years have passed since that titanic battle. The Fatestones lie scattered across the world and the gods of evil are resurgent once more. Eight heroes set off on their own journeys, as if guided by the hand of fate. What tales will these <a title="Genres > Adventure [1,671 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/adventure">adventure</a>rs weave across the vast tapestry of Mardias? You are the only one who can decide!</p><p>The original <em>Romancing SaGa: Minstrel Song</em> included many of the <em>SaGa</em> series trademark elements, such as the Glimmer and Combo mechanics and was considered to be the epitome of the series when it first released. The free scenario system that lets you create your own storyline remains at the core of the game, letting you select one of eight protagonists with completely different origins and backstories, then set off on a unique journey. This remastered edition has evolved in all areas, featuring upgraded high-definition graphics and numerous enhancements to improve playability. And for the first time ever, the game will be fully playable in French, German, Italian, and Spanish. This makes it highly recommended for both fans of the original and newcomers to the <em>SaGa</em> series.</p><p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><ul><li>Brand new localization in French, German, Italian, and Spanish.

We are finally able to grant this desire of our loyal fans! We know there’s a big <em>SaGa</em> fanbase and community in the west, so releasing a new localized edition of the game to more of our fans has long been a dream of mine. I hope to continue to fulfill the wishes of our fans, as well as creating opportunities for even more people to play the game.”</p><p><strong>Masanori Ichikawa, <em>SaGa</em> Series Producer</strong></p><p>“The opportunity for this release all began when Michael Binkowski (CEO, Red Art Games) and Romain Mahut (business development and communications manager, Red Art Games) contacted me directly. Thanks to them, a long-time dream of ours is coming true and I’m so grateful. From visiting the Red Art Games office in France to all the discussions we’ve had on this project, it’s been an amazing experience from start to finish, and I can’t wait for <em>SaGa</em> fans to get their hands on this beautiful game.”</p><p><strong>Hiroyuki Miura, <em>Romancing SaGa: Minstrel Song Remastered</em> Producer</strong></p><p>“<em>Romancing SaGa: Minstrel Song Remastered International</em> is a title that allows players to enjoy a great many of the characteristic mechanics of the <em>SaGa</em> series, including the Freeform Scenario system, Glimmer, and Combos. The addition of new localization into French, German, Italian, and Spanish is particularly impactful for the freeform scenario. Now, players globally will be able to experience the story on an even deeper level, in their native language. I’m excited for more people to discover the <em>SaGa</em> series thanks to the additional language support and the physical release of the game. I’m delighted to be partnering with Red Art Games on this collaboration.”</p></blockquote><p>View a new set of screenshots and box arts <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/gallery/romancing-saga-minstrel-song-remastered-international/august-19-2024/">at the gallery</a>.</p><h2><span>Screenshots</span></h2><div id="carousel_906827"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Lego retired the Super Mario 64 Question Block set at the end of July. The writing was on the wall before then, as the set has frequently been out of stock at major retailers, including Amazon, for months. But strangely enough, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09FMVDHDM?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Amazon has replenished its stock</a>--probably for the last time. If Lego-scalping history is any indication, buying the Mario 64 Lego set for $200 might sound like a deal before long.</p><h2>Lego Super Mario 64 Question Block Set</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4352615-super-mario-cube.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4352615" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4352615-super-mario-cube.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4352615"></a><figcaption>Lego Super Mario 64 Question Block</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4352615-super-mario-cube.jpg"></figure><p>The 2,064-piece Lego set is shaped just like the iconic Question Mark blocks from the Super Mario series, and inside of it are several small dioramas of landscapes from Super Mario 64. You can construct the game's hub world, Peach's Castle, and a trio of levels: Bob-omb Battlefield, Cool Mountain, and Lethal Lava Trouble with this kit, and as you'd expect, the building process is a treat.</p><p>Additionally, this comes with Lego Super Mario 64 microfigures of Mario, Yoshi, Princess Peach, King Bob-omb, and Chain Chomp, and as an added touch, the entire set is compatible with the interactive Lego Mario/Luigi/Peach figures that come with the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/LEGO-Adventures-Interactive-Playset-Nintendo/dp/B0CV2G23D8?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Lego Mario starter courses</a>, which received <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-lego-super-mario-starter-sets-cost-less-and-come-with-better-figures/1100-6525381/" data-ref-id="1100-6525381">cool new editions earlier this month</a>.</p><p>As mentioned above, this Lego set is one of the rare display-grade Nintendo pieces released over the last couple of years. Sure, there are plenty of Mario playsets available, but the diorama kits are certainly more appealing for those who love the Lego building process. Plus, the display sets appeal to the nostalgia of older fans who grew up playing retro Super Mario games. The Question Block would make for a great gift for someone who adores the series.</p><hr><h2>Lego Mario Display Sets</h2><ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09FMVDHDM?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Super Mario 64 Question Block at Amazon</a> (2,064 pieces) -- $200</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/LEGO-Nintendo-Entertainment-Building-Creative/dp/B08FCW3SB7?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Lego NES at Amazon (2,646 pieces)</a> -- $262 (<del>$270</del>) | <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fgoto.target.com%2Fc%2F1804712%2F81938%2F2092%3FsubId1%3Dsubid_value%26u%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Flego-super-mario-nintendo-entertainment-system-set-71374%2F-%2FA-80130334%3Ftag%3Dgamespot-promos-20&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Flast-chance-to-get-lego-super-mario-64-question-block-before-its-gone-for-good%2F1100-6525901%2F%3Fftag%3DCAD-01-10abi2f&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Also at Target</a></li><li><a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fgoto.target.com%2Fc%2F1804712%2F81938%2F2092%3FsubId1%3Dsubid_value%26u%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Flego-super-mario-super-mario-world-mario-38-yoshi-nintendo-figure-71438%2F-%2FA-90573772&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Flast-chance-to-get-lego-super-mario-64-question-block-before-its-gone-for-good%2F1100-6525901%2F%3Fftag%3DCAD-01-10abi2f&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Preorder Super Mario World: Mario &amp; Yoshi at Target</a> (1,215 pieces) -- $130</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/LEGO-Mighty-Bowser-Building-Collectible/dp/B0B3BZZWSL?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Mighty Bowser at Amazon (2,807 pieces)</a> -- $270 | <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fgoto.walmart.com%2Fc%2F1804712%2F565706%2F9383%3Fveh%3Daff%26sourceid%3Dimp_000011112222333344%26u%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FLEGO-6379558-Super-Mario-The-Mighty-Bowser-71411-Building-Toy-Set%2F321283899%26subId1%3Dsubid_value&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Flast-chance-to-get-lego-super-mario-64-question-block-before-its-gone-for-good%2F1100-6525901%2F%3Fftag%3DCAD-01-10abi2f&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Also at Walmart</a></li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/LEGO-TBD-Super-Mario-71426/dp/B0BXQ3M8JH?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Piranaha Plant at Amazon (540 pieces)</a> -- $60 price</li></ul><p>The Question Block is one of only five non-playset Lego Super Mario kits. As it just so happens, Amazon also recently restocked the two largest sets in the lineup.

The Lego NES is a great build for two people to construct together, as it comes with separate instruction booklets for the CRT TV and console.</p><p>One of those five sets has yet to be released. <strong><a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fgoto.target.com%2Fc%2F1804712%2F81938%2F2092%3FsubId1%3Dsubid_value%26u%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Flego-super-mario-super-mario-world-mario-38-yoshi-nintendo-figure-71438%2F-%2FA-90573772&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Flast-chance-to-get-lego-super-mario-64-question-block-before-its-gone-for-good%2F1100-6525901%2F%3Fftag%3DCAD-01-10abi2f&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Super Mario World: Mario &amp; Yoshi launches October 1 and is available to preorder now at Target</a></strong> for $130. This particular set looks like a fun showpiece, as it features multiple moving elements to recreate animations from Super Mario World, as it recreates Mario and his trusty dinosaur pal Yoshi in all their pixel-art glory.</p><p>There's also the massive Mighty Bowser set, which is extremely cool but admittedly quite expensive, so if you'd like to have something representing Mario's greatest rival, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/LEGO-Bowsers-Muscle-Expansion-Collectible/dp/B0CGY1MQFD?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Lego Bowser Muscle Car</a> is a smaller and fun little set to consider, especially when it's only $24 (was $30). The Bowser Muscle Car set is technically a playset, but it definitely works as a display piece, too. Also on the budget side of things is the <strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/LEGO-TBD-Super-Mario-71426/dp/B0BXQ3M8JH?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Piranha Plant</a></strong>.

            <p>Yes, Nintendo is opening up its Japanese Nintendo Museum for a tour later today. No, it will not be taking questions about anything else at this time.</p>
<p>That's the official line from Nintendo, which announced on its official American X/Twitter account over the weekend that whilst it's happy to share a quick 10-minute tour of its Kyoto museum, "there will be no game announcements or mention of the Nintendo Switch successor during this presentation".</p>

<p>"Join us [later today], August 19 at 3pm PT, for a tour of the Nintendo Museum that’s scheduled to open during the fall of 2024 in Kyoto, Japan!" the account announced. "The Nintendo Museum Direct livestream will last roughly 10 minutes.</p>
<p>"Please note that there will be no game announcements or mention of the Nintendo Switch successor during this presentation," a subsequent tweet confirmed.</p>

<p>Nintendo Museum was announced at a Nintendo Direct almost a year ago now. It's now set to open fall/autumn 2024, having slipped a little from its initial March 2024 opening date.</p>
<p>While Nintendo's statement is a firm indication that we won't get any news about <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-everything-we-know">Switch 2</a> just yet, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-release-date-now-q1-2025-report">Eurogamer sources previously confirmed that Switch 2 will launch in 2025</a>. Our understanding is that Switch 2 was previously due to arrive later in 2024.</p>
<p>Nintendo has opted for a 2025 launch instead to ensure the console arrives with a more robust software line-up, Eurogamer understands. Here's hoping this extra time also allows for any new Joy-Con hiccups to be ironed out, and we avoid a repeat of the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/two-in-five-switch-joy-cons-affected-by-drift-says-uk-consumer-watchdog-report">Joy-Con drift drama</a> that has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-pledges-to-repair-switch-joy-con-free-in-uk-until-further-notice">plagued the current Switch</a> through its lifespan.</p>
<p>While we're on the topic of museums… did you see that a Two Point Museum was on the way?</p>
<p>As Ed said in his wonderful preview earlier this month, just as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/two-point-campus-review-university-was-never-this-fun">Two Point Campus</a> iterated on Two Point Hospital, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/two-point-museum-turns-a-fresh-slice-of-mundane-life-into-a-wacky-british-adventure">Two Point Museum looks to be doing the same</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/hollow-knight-silksong-not-at-gamescom-opening-night-live/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>As many fans were hoping and praying, Geoff Keighley himself has officially confirmed that Hollow Knight Silksong will not be at Gamescom Opening Night Live. In <a href="https://x.com/geoffkeighley/status/1824923122929119364?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1824923122929119364%7Ctwgr%5E6c037ce01b6b1f449db9cec0e0dd69ac61322759%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fhollow-knight-silksong-will-not-be-shown-at-gamescom-opening-night-live%2F1100-6525900%2F" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a post on X</a>, he made the statement so that people could lower their expectations for Hollow Knight Silksong being at Gamescom Opening Night Live.</p>
<p>In the post, he says, "Just to get this out of the way, no Silksong on Tuesday at ONL. Team Cherry is still cooking." Fans have been patiently waiting for any news on Silksong since 2019 when it was first announced on Valentine's Day in 2019, alongside a developer diary video. Since then, updates have been very few and far between, with minimal information given to those waiting for the sequel. In 2019, fans saw the most updates for Hollow Knight Silksong, with the most recent update being in 2022, when fans saw a brand-new trailer for the game.</p>
<p>Past that point, they did express that there were delays in the development, with Team Cherry initially planning to release Hollow Knight Silksong in 2023. However, 2023 quickly came and went, and there was, unfortunately, still no sign of it. The latest glimpse of progress is the&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/hollow-knight-silksong-xbox-rating/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ESRB rating for Hollow Knight Silksong,</a> which went live on the Xbox Store Page about four months ago.</p>
<p>As far as people know, Hollow Knight Silksong is still very much in development, with no news of it being canceled or further delayed. Unfortunately, no one knows how much progress Team Cherry has made during this time.</p>
<p>Over the years, Gamescom Opening Night Live has seen some huge announcements. While people have expressed their disappointment in the lack of Hollow Knight Silksong, they are now (jokingly) holding out hope for Bloodborne or Bloodborne 2.</p>
<p>So far, it has been confirmed that people can expect to see content from Kingdom Come: Deliverance II, Indiana Jones, and The Great Circle, as well as a brand-new game made by Tarsier Studios, the developers behind award-winning Little Nightmares.</p>
<p>In addition to those titles, viewers will also get glimpses into Call of Duty: Black Ops 6, MARVEL Rivals, Black Myth: Wukong, and Dune Awakening, to name a few. There is something for everyone to look into for Gamescom Opening Night Live, which will be airing on August 20 at 11 AM PT / 2 PM ET / 7 PM BST and 8 PM CEST.</p>
<p>Gamescom has a jam-packed schedule this year, so keep your eyes and ears out for any upcoming announcements.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fantasy-life-i-girl-who-steals-time-delayed-indefinitely<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nintendo has announced that Level-5's upcoming life-sim-come-RPG&nbsp;<em>Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time&nbsp;</em>has been delayed beyond its original release date, and no new release date has been revealed either.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://x.com/NintendoEurope/status/1825535030866628851" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a message</a> on the official European Nintendo X (formerly Twitter) account, the company reveals that <i>Fantasy Life i&nbsp;</i>has been delayed and that "more information about the new release date will be announced in the future".</p>
<p>The game was originally slated to launch on October 10th around the world for Nintendo Switch, but sadly, it seems it'll be quite some time until you can enjoy Level-5's latest cozy adventure.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/fantasy-life-i-the-girl-who-steals-time-delayed-napdragon.jpg?itok=PPx5bT22 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/fantasy-life-i-the-girl-who-steals-time-delayed-napdragon.jpg?itok=K7IRRN1y 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>It's now unclear when exactly&nbsp;<em>Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time&nbsp;</em>will arrive.</figcaption></figure><p><em>Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time&nbsp;</em>was originally announced all the way back in February 2023 as part of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/february-2023-nintendo-direct-here-are-all-news-announcements">that month's Nintendo Direct presentation</a>.</p>
<p>A full-blown sequel to 2013's 3DS RPG&nbsp;<em>Fantasy Life</em>, the game, which is being developed by&nbsp;<em>Professor Layton&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Inazuma Eleven&nbsp;</em>creator Level-5, was originally due to launch sometime in 2023.</p>
<p>However, in November of that year, Level-5 announced that&nbsp;<em>Fantasy Life i&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fantasy-life-i-girl-who-steals-time-delayed">would be pushed back to 2024</a>, citing a need to ensure that the game was "better quality for everyone" when it eventually launched.</p>
<p>That same month, Level-5 revealed a summer 2024 release window for&nbsp;<em>Fantasy Life i</em>, eventually announcing a full release date of October 10th during <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-direct-partner-showcase-january-2023-recap-find-all-news-and-announcements">this past February's Nintendo Direct</a> (although it may have been somewhat overshadowed by the Xbox-on-Switch reveals).</p>

<p>When the game does eventually arrive, it'll offer a similar blend of simple action-RPG combat and life-sim job dabbling as its predecessor did.</p>
<p>Taking place once again in the land of Reveria,&nbsp;<em>Fantasy Life i&nbsp;</em>will task you with solving two core mysteries: one revolving around the titular "girl who steals time", and another concerning a dragon soaring through Reveria's skies.</p>
<p>Naturally,&nbsp;<em>Fantasy Life i&nbsp;</em>isn't available for pre-order yet, but you can keep up with it <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/fantasy-life-i-the-girl-who-steals-time-switch/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">via the Nintendo eShop</a> if you want to. Level-5 <a href="https://www.fantasylife.jp/fli/en/topics/240819/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">says it'll announce a new release date</a> during its "To the World's Children" event, although we're not sure when that will be just yet. Stay tuned for more.</p>

<p>Hideo Kojima has teased the arrival of a new character for Death Stranding 2 through his latest post on <a href="https://x.com/HIDEO_KOJIMA_EN/status/1825443327455723644" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (formerly Twitter). &nbsp;</p>



<p>Kojima’s latest post includes a silhouette of the character with the words ‘Who Am I?’. Players might remember that Elle Fanning was teased similarly before the official announcement. Moreover, with Gamescom ONL taking place tomorrow, Kojima might provide players with an official reveal and other details about Death Stranding 2.&nbsp;</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>It is difficult to discern who the new character arriving for Death Stranding 2 is. However, players on Reddit have zeroed in on one actor. As per one of the recent posts on the r/DeathStranding <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DeathStranding/comments/1evwgbj/kojima_posted_a_new_ds2_teaser_featuring_kenjiro/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">subreddit</a>, players believe that the teased character is none other than Japanese actor Kenjiro Tsuda.&nbsp;</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Kenjiro Tsuda was involved in the previous Death Stranding game as the Japanese voice actor for Sam Bridges. The existing connection has led players to speculate that he may receive a character in the sequel. Tsuda is well-known for voicing popular anime characters such as Kento Nanami in Jujutsu Kaisen, Seto Kaiba in Yu-Gi-Oh!, Overhaul in My Hero Academia and more. However, we will have to wait for an official announcement to know for sure.</p>



<p>In other news, Death Stranding has become <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/death-stranding-mod-delivery-sim/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a true delivery boy simulator</a> thanks to one mod. Also, check out Death Stranding 2: On the Beach’s previous <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/death-stranding-2-new-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">story trailer</a>.

Alongside the tease is the promise of more information at ONL, which kicks off at 11am PT / 2pm ET tomorrow, August 20.</p><blockquote data-theme="light">— Geoff Keighley (@geoffkeighley) <a href="https://twitter.com/geoffkeighley/status/1825502979950064033?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">August 19, 2024</a></blockquote> <p>But what is The Beast? <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1ew046c/comment/liv2zx5/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fans have already linked</a> it to a recent trademark for a new Dying Light game called Dying Light: The Beast, which popped up on the United States Patent and Trademark Office last week. Dying Light developer Techland is listed as the owner of the trademark.</p><blockquote data-theme="light">— Kurakasis (@Kurakasis) <a href="https://twitter.com/Kurakasis/status/1823724772607582497?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">August 14, 2024</a></blockquote> <p>The question now is whether Dying Light: The Beast is DLC for <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/dying-light-2">Dying Light 2</a>, a standalone expansion, a smaller-scale entry or spin-off, or what should be considered a fully-fledged sequel in the Dying Light series.</p><p>Dying Light 2 launched two-and-a-half years ago, in February 2022, as a sequel to the hugely popular zombie kill ‘em-up Dying Light. <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dying-light-2-sold-5-million-units-in-its-first-month-dying-light-1-has-crossed-20-million-units-sold">It sold five million copies in its first month on sale</a>.

Confirmed games set to appear during the two-hour show include Call of Duty: Black Ops 6, Civilization 7, Monster Hunter Wilds, and Indiana Jones and the Great Circle.</p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

"Immersive" cards, meanwhile, will let the player "enter the world" of the card's art, which will give them an extended look at the full art piece of the featured Pokemon.</p><p dir="ltr">Pokemon Trading Card Game Pocket joins Pokemon Trading Card Game Live as official Pokemon TCG apps for mobile devices. Live is the full TCG experience--collecting, battling, and full competitions all feature heavily--whereas Pocket is intended to be a simpler, easy-to-pick-up way to play with digital Pokemon cards.</p><p dir="ltr">Other announcements from the Pokemon World Championships include the addition of Armarouge, Darkrai, and Psyduck to Pokemon Unite, an apparent tease for Gigantamax transformations in Pokemon Go, and the return of Trainer's Pokemon to the Pokemon Trading Card Game, with N's Zoroark and Marnie's Grimmsnarl among the revealed cards.</p><p dir="ltr">Pokemon Trading Card Game Pocket launches October 30 on both iOS and Android devices. Pre-registrations are now available on both the Apple App Store and Google Play store.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/nearly-90-of-developers-surveyed-say-premium-games-dont-need-microtransactions/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>The microtransaction debate has been raging within the gaming industry for years now, and it’s not just players who question the necessity of the extra purchases. In a recent survey among developers at <a href="https://www.devcom.global/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Devcom</a> 2024 in Cologne, nearly 90% of those asked said that premium games don’t need microtransactions.</p>



<p>According to the 100 developers asked out of the 300 speakers at the event, 89% said that they believe that premium AAA games can be “financially successful just by being Buy-to-Play.” Sticking with business models, 65% of people believe in a premium game’s model for both physical and digital games. Only one person believed that free-to-play with ads was the best direction of the industry.</p>



<p>In other areas of the survey, 31% of developers prefer little AI usage in game development. That said, 21% did have interest in using AI to help with coding and general production to increase the development speed of the games.  Finally, in regards to AI, the belief among those polled was that AI could replace human localizations and translations within the next 12-24 months.</p>



<p>Moving on to challenges facing the industry as a whole, 55% believe it’s caused by market saturation while another 46% point towards the rising development costs of games. Regarding layoffs, 57% said that layoffs will continue either at the same pace or a higher pace over the next 12 months. On the opposite side of things, 43% said that layoffs will decrease within the same time frame.</p>



<p>Devcom is currently taking place in Cologne, Germany alongside Gamescom 2024. Insider Gaming will be at Gamescom all week long, bringing you the latest from the annual event.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/original-resident-evil-2-gog-release-date<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>GOG has announced that the original&nbsp;<em>Resident Evil 2&nbsp;</em>will soon be available on its platform in all its pixelated, blocky glory, so get ready to revisit Raccoon City as it was in the late 90s.</p>
<p>Per <a href="https://x.com/GOGcom/status/1825451410843930690" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a new post on X (formerly Twitter)</a>,&nbsp;<em>Resident Evil 2&nbsp;</em>will launch on GOG on August 27th. It follows on from the release of the original&nbsp;<em>Resident Evil</em>, which arrived on GOG's platform <a href="https://x.com/GOGcom/status/1805874548937482308" rel="noopener" target="_blank">all the way back in late June</a>.</p>
<p>Both&nbsp;<em>Resident Evil&nbsp;</em>and its sequel will be available to buy separately on GOG, but you can also avail yourself of <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/resident_evil_bundle" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">a bundle</a> that includes both games, as well as the upcoming re-release of the third game, which has yet to receive a release date.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/resident-evil-2-gog-re-release.jpg?itok=auS9kaGg 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/resident-evil-2-gog-re-release.jpg?itok=y-20RSnl 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The original&nbsp;<em>Resident Evil 2&nbsp;</em>may not be as shiny as the remake, but it's still got some survival horror thrills to enjoy.</figcaption></figure><p>If you only know&nbsp;<em>Resident Evil 2&nbsp;</em>from its <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/resident-evil-2-remake">excellent 2019 remake</a>, then the sheer low-poly glory of the 1998 original may come as something of a shock to you, but that's 1998 survival horror for you.</p>
<p>Much like the remake, the original game features two different playable characters, Leon and Claire. You'll take a different route through the game depending on which one you pick, and you'll find different items and weapons along the way as well.</p>
<p>Unlike the remake, however, the original&nbsp;<em>Resident Evil 2&nbsp;</em>features fixed-camera, pre-rendered environments and tank controls, which can perhaps take a little getting used to if you're accustomed to the smoother&nbsp;<em>Resident Evil 4</em>-inspired gameplay style of the 2019 version.</p>
<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Resident Evil 2</em>'s intro to its Claire campaign right here. Marvel at the early 3D models and, er, "interesting" voice acting.</p>

<p><em>Resident Evil 2&nbsp;</em>lands on GOG on August 27th. We still don't have a release date for the third game on GOG yet, so stay tuned for more on that and all other things&nbsp;<em>Resident Evil</em>-related.</p>

Every attack from the Shifu, including follow-ups and counters, will provide March 7th with one point of charge. Reaching a minimum of seven points gives her an immediate action with an enhanced basic attack. Further, the ally’s path will determine whether March 7th’s Basic ATK deals additional DMG or an increased Toughness Reduction. I’ll be going over how to unlock this multi-talented warrior and how to craft the best builds.</p><h2 id="h21"><a id=""></a><strong>How to unlock March 7th (The Hunt)</strong></h2><p>Acquiring this character can be a little confusing due to the limited-time event centered around her. <strong>I do want to stress that you can only unlock the character by working your way through the story and reaching the Trailblaze Continuance mission “March to Mastery: A Star Is Born.”</strong></p><p>Although the Saga of Primaveral Blade event during version 2.4 does center around March 7th’s training, and it is possible for those who aren’t as far along in the story to play it early, this will not unlock her. The event only entails a fun minigame with the character and some great limited-time awards. Every player, early access or not, should go through the event anyway though just to unlock free Eidolons for her.</p><h2 id="h22"><a id=""></a><strong>Best March 7th (The Hunt) team composition</strong></h2><figure id="" data-id="dbdcb3aa779ccd8e67704c28cd919651" data-recommend-id="image://dbdcb3aa779ccd8e67704c28cd919651" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1044" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Four characters on the Team Lineup Screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Four characters on the Team Lineup Screen." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->HoYoverse / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="dbdcb3aa779ccd8e67704c28cd919651" data-recommend-id="image://dbdcb3aa779ccd8e67704c28cd919651" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1044" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Four characters on the Team Lineup Screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The biggest advantage that March 7th (The Hunt) has is her adaptability. I’d argue she might just be the most versatile character we can earn for free in <em>Honkai: Star Rail</em>. While you do want to pair her with at least one character who can constantly throw out attacks, the primary roles should revolve around Break DMG or Crit Rate DMG.<br></p><p><strong>If you want to focus on Break Effects and Break DMG, you should make use of Trailblazer (Imaginary) and/or Ruan Mei.</strong> Both are wonderful supports to provide all the necessary Break-related buffs. The former will be the most accessible, since they’re unlocked for free.</p><p>Building March 7th’s charge is a key responsibility for her Shifu, which is why characters with counter-attacks mesh well. <strong>Yunli and Clara can both perform wonderfully in this role.</strong> Although the former can dish out counters more consistently, the latter can aggro enemies into attacking her.</p><p><strong>Most Healer or Sustain characters will do fine, but Lynx and Gallagher are the best options.</strong> Lynx works especially well with either Yunli or Clara since they can both activate the second part of her skill that will aggro enemies to them. Gallagher on the other hand can dish out strong damage and the Besotted state he inflicts on enemies will result in more Break DMG.</p><h2 id="h23"><a id=""></a><strong>Best March 7th (The Hunt) Light Cones</strong></h2><figure id="" data-id="bb2a58b7d9a186ab7da8d11807be48ec" data-recommend-id="image://bb2a58b7d9a186ab7da8d11807be48ec" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1046" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A card called River Flows in Spring is displayed on the Light Cone screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A card called River Flows in Spring is displayed on the Light Cone screen." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->HoYoverse / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="bb2a58b7d9a186ab7da8d11807be48ec" data-recommend-id="image://bb2a58b7d9a186ab7da8d11807be48ec" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1046" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A card called River Flows in Spring is displayed on the Light Cone screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>As a 4-star character that isn’t even a part of a banner, March 7th (The Hunt) doesn’t have any associated Light Cones to act as a perfect match. Thankfully, there are plenty of great Light Cones to give her.<br></p><p><strong>In The Night and Baptism Of Pure Thought are the top two five-star choices if you’re concerned about CRIT DMG.</strong> The former is potentially the better option since it can buff Basic ATK DMG too. A more accessible free-to-play option is Cruising In The Stellar Sea, which can be purchased from Herta’s Store.</p><p>Any of the above Light Cones should work fine with any build for March 7th (The Hunt), but <strong>the best to improve Break DMG would be the five-star Sailing Towards A Second Life</strong>. Even at the base Superimposition level, it will increase Break Effect by an outstanding 60 percent among a host of other buffs. If you missed out on pulling that, <strong>River Flows in Spring</strong> is a great alternative that can be purchased in the Forgotten Hall’s Light Cone Store. The buffs it provides will stay in play as long as the wearer doesn’t take any damage.</p><h2 id="h24"><a id=""></a><strong>Which Traces to prioritize</strong></h2><p>Along with the base flexibility of March 7th (The Hunt), the character’s potential opens up even more with the right traces. Here are the ones to focus on first, no matter what kind of build you’re going for:</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Filigree – This is a must-have when it comes to traces and bonus abilities. Filigree allows March 7th to reduce the toughness of enemies with the same Weakness Type as her selected Shifu. Additionally, managing to cause a Weakness Break will trigger it as an Imaginary one</li><li>My Sword Zaps Demons – With her skill being purely for support, you’ll be using the Basic Attack the most in battle. It’s important to upgrade this as much as possible</li><li>Tide Tamer – This bonus ability is activated after using an Enhanced Basic Attack. The selected Shifu will have 60 percent increased CRIT DMG and a 36 percent increase to their Break Effect.</li></ul><h2 id="h25"><a id=""></a><strong>Best March 7th (The Hunt) Relic Sets</strong></h2><figure id="" data-id="9c94828da9e021b1c7ae45c40724b019" data-recommend-id="image://9c94828da9e021b1c7ae45c40724b019" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1044" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A full relic and planar ornament set on the Relics screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A full relic and planar ornament set on the Relics screen." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->HoYoverse / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="9c94828da9e021b1c7ae45c40724b019" data-recommend-id="image://9c94828da9e021b1c7ae45c40724b019" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1044" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A full relic and planar ornament set on the Relics screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>While March 7th has ideal Light Cones to be paired, there are some options that can work no matter what kind of build you’re using. The specific effects of Relic sets are much more suited to particular character builds though. Below are the best Relic and Ornament Sets to use if you want a Break DPS build. Those who have <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/firefly-honkai-star-rail-hsr-banner-build-1851559899&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/firefly-honkai-star-rail-hsr-banner-build-1851559899">Firefly</a></span> will likely recognize these options.<br></p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Iron Cavalry Against The Scourge is arguably the best choice. The Break Effect increase is solid, while the potential to partially ignore enemy DEF can make a huge difference if the Break Effect value is high enough</li><li>Your next best option is to go with Thief Of Shooting Meteor. A maximum Break Effect increase of 32 percent can be a huge help with an Imaginary character like March 7th (The Hunt)</li><li>The Planar Ornament set matching well with the above is Talia: Kingdom Of Banditry. Its base 16 percent Break Effect increase is the same as Iron Cavalry’s, while the additional 20 percent will be very noticeable if her SPD stat reaches 145.</li></ul><p><strong>Read More:</strong>&nbsp;<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/firefly-honkai-star-rail-hsr-banner-build-1851559899&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/firefly-honkai-star-rail-hsr-banner-build-1851559899">The Best Firefly Build in <em>Honkai: Star Rail</em></a></span></p><p>A DPS or CRIT DPS build is best outfitted with something different. The below sets will provide fantastic DMG and CRIT-related buffs.</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Musketeer Of Wild Wheat can be found everywhere in <em>Honkai: Star Rail</em>, and it’s thankfully the best relic set for this purpose. The four-piece effect is especially helpful due to how often you’ll be using her Basic Attack</li><li>Wastelander Of Banditry Desert is a great alternative relic set. The CRIT Rate and Crit DMG buffs are situational, although the Filigree trace can increase the likelihood of them occurring</li><li>Rutilant Arena is the best Planar Ornament set to pair with either of the above. It increases CRIT Rate by 8 percent and can then increase Basic ATK damage by 20 percent if the CRIT Rate is raised enough.</li></ul><p>March 7th (The Hunt) might just be one of the most busted characters you can unlock for free. I was a fan of her original Preservation version, but I’ve been having a lot more fun with this new path. The flexibility of this character is sure to be a strong addition to any <em>Honkai: Star Rail</em> players’ teams.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/dying-light-the-beast-possibly-teased-in-new-gamescom-trailer/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>In a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YXYuW0RTApA" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new trailer</a> released today, the official Gamescom channel possibly teased Dying Light: The Beast with mysterious live-action footage. </p>



<p>The first half of the trailer is bright and cheerful, while the second half turns gloomy and bloody, and closes with the tagline “the beast is coming.” </p>



<p>The trailer does not confirm anything, and Techland has not issued anything official yet either.</p>



<p>However, new reports surfaced just last week that Techland filed a new trademark <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/new-trademark-filed-for-dying-light/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">for Dying Light: The Beast</a>. The trademark did not make the exact nature of the project clear.</p>



<p>Today’s cryptic new trailer, which may be for another project altogether, says that the big reveal is coming to Gamescom’s Opening Night Live. Fans can tune in at 11 AM pacific time / 2 PM eastern time to see the reveal live.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="The Beast Is Coming to gamescom Opening Night Live on Tuesday" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YXYuW0RTApA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>







<p>Fans quickly speculated about the imagery and sound effects in the new teaser, trying to identify familiar elements from Dying Light. </p>



<p>The recent trademark for Dying Light: The Beast was not approved yet last week, so any appearance at Gamescom could be fairly small. However, it could at least confirm if today’s trailer is related to Dying Light, and what kind of content fans should expect.</p>



<p>In a new <a href="https://x.com/geoffkeighley/status/1825504189327233321" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">post on X,</a> Geoff Keighley replied to a fan asking for a “real” trailer instead of live-action or CGI. Keighley teased that fans should “tune in then.”</p>



<p>Most recently, Dying Light 2 Stay Human launched in February 2022. Last May, the original Dying Light also saw its player count <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dying-light-player-count-soar/">rise by over 300%</a> following a massive sale. </p>

                <p>Nintendo has announced a new Nintendo Direct presentation for August 19 at 3 PM PT / 6 PM ET. However, it's not the usual kind of Nintendo Direct that you'd expect.</p><p>This showcase is actually a 10-minute "Nintendo Museum Direct" and will be a tour of the Nintendo Museum that's slated to open this fall in Kyoto, Japan. To clear up any confusion and dash any hopes, Nintendo <a href="https://x.com/NintendoAmerica/status/1825291853861683644" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">also said</a> that there will be no game announcements or any mention of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-release-date-specs-display-price/1100-6520278/" data-ref-id="1100-6520278">Switch successor</a> during this presentation.</p><p>Nintendo has been upfront about what to expect from its Nintendo Direct presentations, especially when it comes to the Switch's successor. However, it has <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-successor-will-be-revealed-by-april-2025/1100-6523222/" data-ref-id="1100-6523222">confirmed that it will at least be revealed by April 2025</a>. The last Direct Nintendo aired was back in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/nintendo-direct-june-2024-all-the-biggest-announcements/2900-5478/" data-ref-id="2900-5478">June</a>, and it revealed some big games like The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom, and it finally set the 2025 release window for Metroid Prime 4: Beyond.</p><p>It's not out of the ordinary for Nintendo to have Directs focused on certain games or properties. After all, Nintendo had two Directs specifically for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/final-super-mario-bros-movie-trailer-arrives-more-rainbow-road/1100-6512204/" data-ref-id="1100-6512204">The Super Mario Bros.

                <p>Team Cherry will not be showing anything related to Hollow Knight: Silksong this week, much to the dismay of many fans.</p><p>Host Geoff Keighley said on Twitter, "Just to get this out of the way, no Silksong on Tuesday at ONL. Team Cherry is still cooking." Fans have taken the announcement and responded to it in humorous ways in order to cope with the news.

They were pointing out the image with the main character in clown makeup that Keighley used. It's a common trend that appears when fans hope that Silksong shows up whenever a showcase like a Nintendo Direct is announced.</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gamescom-opening-night-live-2024-start-time-how-to-watch/1100-6525217/" data-ref-id="1100-6525217">Gamescom Opening Night Live 2024</a> airs on August 20 at 11 AM PT / 2 PM ET in Cologne, Germany.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-no-switch-2-news-direct-museum<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nintendo has announced a brand new Direct presentation, but before you get too excited, it's not the kind of show where you'll learn more about the Switch 2, a point about which Nintendo is being very clear.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://x.com/NintendoAmerica/status/1825291849990304138" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a post on X</a> (formerly known as Twitter), Nintendo announced yesterday that a new Direct will be held later today, and it'll show off some of the exhibits you'll be able to see at the Nintendo Museum, which is opening this fall in Kyoto.</p>
<p>The showcase will last around ten minutes, so it's not going to be a particularly long presentation, but it should be a good opportunity to learn more about Nintendo's history and find out more about the museum. What it won't feature, however, is any info about the Switch 2.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/nintendo-direct-switch-2-museum-original-switch.jpg?itok=xH_hPIhw 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/nintendo-direct-switch-2-museum-original-switch.jpg?itok=Ew4WCL1T 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Sorry, Switch fans. Today's Direct isn't for you.</figcaption></figure><p>Likely understanding that speculation about the Switch 2 is ramping up, Nintendo followed up its original Direct announcement with <a href="https://x.com/NintendoAmerica/status/1825291853861683644" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a post</a> stating that "there will be no game announcements or mention of the Nintendo Switch successor" during today's show.</p>
<p>It might be hard to understand what kind of person would seriously expect a Switch 2 announcement as part of a museum tour video, but, well, there's a good reason Nintendo has disabled the chat on the new Direct's YouTube feed.</p>
<p>For context, Nintendo president Shuntaro Furukawa <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-announcement-confirmation">announced back in May</a>&nbsp;that information about the Switch 2 would be revealed sometime before the end of the fiscal year, which gives the studio until the end of March 2025 to announce something.</p>
<p>Of course, March is a long way away, and the announcement could come any time between now and then, but every new announcement Nintendo makes, however seemingly unrelated to the Switch 2 it is, stokes the fires of rumor even further.</p>

The stream is set to start at 3pm Pacific (that's 6pm Eastern). Stay tuned for more on this and all other things Nintendo.</p>
