			<p>Publisher 505 Games and developer Supernova Games Studios, alongside a technical partnership with KUNOS Simulazioni, have announced a new branch of the Assetto Corsa series with Assetto Corsa Rally, a new rally racing game to expand on the sim racing already established in other Assetto Corsa games. It'll arrive on PC first with an <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3917090/Assetto_Corsa_Rally/">Early Access release on Steam</a> set for this coming November 13, 2025.</p>



<p>It'll be the second Assetto Corsa release this year, after Assetto Corsa EVO <a href="https://wccftech.com/assetto-corsa-evo-to-get-open-world-map-in-summer-2025-early-access-begins-january-16/">launched on January 16, 2025, also in early access</a>. It's also still in early access, with the last word on its 1.0 release being Fall 2025. That said, we're more than halfway through October at the time of this writing, and there's no official update.</p>



<p>A short teaser trailer went alongside the announcement for Assetto Corsa Rally, which included short clips of in-game footage showcasing how Assetto Corsa is approaching rally racing.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="ASSETTO CORSA RALLY ANNOUNCEMENT TRAILER" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/U1_7q_gHrTo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Assetto Corsa Rally has been built with an adapted version of KUNOS Simulazioni's physics engine, which was tuned to better suit rally-style racing with uneven surfaces, jumps, more variable road conditions, a dynamic weather system, and more realistic vehicle behaviour across all the new variables and terrains found in rally racing.</p>



<p>In a press release, Supernova Games Studios specifically calls out the use of "<em>laser scan technology for every stage in each rally event, enabling accurate reproduction of real-world terrain formations, road surface irregularities and characteristics, and details of the surrounding environment like vegetation positioning</em>."</p>



<p>Alongside the physics engine built by KUNOS Simulazioni, Supernova Game Studios is developing Assetto Corsa Rally using Unreal Engine 5, to ensure "<em>high fidelity and performance</em>."</p>



<p>When Assetto Corsa Rally launches in early access next month, it'll include:</p>



<ul>
<li><em>33km&nbsp;of fully laserscanned&nbsp;real-life roads.</em></li>



<li><em>4 Special Stages&nbsp;with&nbsp;18 variants, set across gravel roads in&nbsp;Wales&nbsp;and tarmac roads in&nbsp;Alsace</em>.</li>



<li><em>10 iconic rally cars, including Group B, WRC and Rally2 vehicles</em>.</li>



<li><em>5 game modes, triple screen support, and more</em></li>
</ul>



<p>The full 1.0 version of the game will add six more special stages, a full 30 vehicle roster, new game modes including a career mode, a rally school mode, and VR support. For now, there's no inclination as to when v1.0 is expected to be ready.</p>



<p>"<em>Feeling the lack of a modern rally simulator, we've built a team and developed a technology to create one ourselves, with support of drivers, engineers, collectors, mechanics, and industry experts,</em>" Supernova Game Studios director, Maura Notarberardino, said. "<em>A special thanks goes to KUNOS Simulazioni, whose partnership was crucial in maintaining the signature feel of the series, especially in terms of the driving model, in this new chapter. Today marks an exciting new beginning for Supernova and Assetto Corsa Rally, and we can't wait to share the journey with you</em>."</p>



<p>KUNOS Simulazioni co-founder Marco Massarutto also added that a rally racing simulator in the Assetto Corsa series has been heavily requested by fans for years, and also shed some light as to why it took the series as long as it did to take this new step.</p>



<p>"<em>A proper rally simulation requires a dedicated approach that can leverage the unique aspects of this motorsports discipline,</em>" he began. "<em>Racing primarily against the chronometer, rather than against dozens of real-time processed AI opponents, frees up noticeable CPU resources, and this allows developers to push the boundaries of physics, as well as mechanical behaviour and tire models, across different surfaces that Assetto Corsa Rally will feature and simulate.</em>"</p>



<p>"<em>The result is a dedicated and genuine rally simulation, powered by the Assetto Corsa physics engine, that can fully exploit its potential without compromise. Combining this advanced engine with some of the best real rally stages reproduced using laser-scan technology, the most iconic rally cars, adding up on the passion and competence of the Supernova dev-team, will allow to deliver an ultimate experience that fans have been anticipating for decades</em>."</p>



<p>Notarberardino is not entirely wrong to point out that there's a gap in the racing game genre when it comes to simulation-style rally racing games. After <a href="https://wccftech.com/codemasters-ceo-ea-is-like-our-cinderella-shoe-a-perfect-fit-they-listen-but-dont-force-us/">EA acquired Codemasters</a>, and gained the rights to publish WRC games, it was expected that we'd get WRC games each year from 2023 to 2027, but that partnership ended after the release of EA Sports WRC 23. Codemasters <a href="https://wccftech.com/codemasters-shows-off-f1-25-gameplay-confirms-wrc-games-are-on-pause/">confirmed earlier that it was pausing work on future WRC and rally games</a>, so fans of the more sim-focused WRC series and the less sim, more arcade-y DiRT were both let down.</p>



<p>A month after Codemasters' announcement, we learned that <a href="https://wccftech.com/nacon-is-once-again-publishing-wrc-games-new-wrc-series-in-development/">Nacon was taking back control of making WRC-licensed games</a>, but because they're just starting up again, we still have some time before Nacon is ready to release a new WRC title.</p>



<p>Which means that when Assetto Corsa Rally hits PC in November, it'll be something new for rally fans, specifically simulation-focused rally racing fans, to dig their tires into. We'll see how it fares and how Assetto Corsa does with its first rally racing game.</p>

            <p>You've played through countless immersive sims as a cyborg, a thief, and a cyborg thief. Now, try doing it as a scuttling demon dominatrix. Brush Burial: Gutter World is the sneaky and frenetic new dollop of squalor from Knife Demon Software. It casts you once again as Fennel, a swamp devil with a pronged tail you can use as a whip and a grapple, knocking props around and swiping crossbow bolts out of midair. </p>
<p>Fennel seems as agile here as in the previous, excellent <a href="https://knifedemon.itch.io/brush-burial">Brush Burial</a>, pouncing from head to head like a tic, but they've bolstered their moveset with an injection of overclocked koppōjutsu. You can snare foes to perform sinuous, bone-crunching takedowns, the catch being that you're vulnerable during the execution. It's deeply, moreishly unpleasant. Those little fatal jerks at the end of the animation are more visceral than anything in Doom Eternal. I'm not sure I can bear to watch the trailer again. Here it is.

<p>There's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3594120/Brush_Burial_Gutter_World/">a demo for Gutter World on Steam</a>. The full thing will have four levels, with an emphasis on replaying to experiment with bending spines in different directions, and to unlock cosmetics. I like Fennel's wardrobe. Adam Jensen never got to rock a corset and thigh highs and he was all the poorer for it. 
</p><p>The game's environments are wiry, occult creations in which all the objects look like they've been crushed into shape. Mournful and decrepit spaces that seem both wildly improvised and carefully engineered. This is a realm of ugliness and deprivation, and you are under no obligation to be nice to it. "Lose your way in the slithering guts of the colonial undercarriage," comments the Steam page. "Make wealth out of misery." Here's a bulletpoint rundown from the developer.
</p>
<blockquote><ul>
<li>Tightly designed and interconnected levels with numerous paths to the objective, full of hostile or friendly NPCs who react to crimes like stealing, trespassing, and murder.</li>
<li>Fast paced, instantaneous combat that is simple but robust, encouraging the use of improvised or stolen weapons, environmental objects, and a unique hand-to-hand takedown system.</li>
<li>Dozens of unique cosmetics to be unlocked through gameplay challenges, as well as progression through the game's levels.</li>
<li>One 'Greater Contract' and Three 'Lesser Contracts' to complete. Four levels in total, built to be replayed.</li>
</ul></blockquote>
<p>I caught wind of the new demo from Problem Attic developer Liz Ryerson, who has <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/ellaguro.bsky.social/post/3m372prihgk24">rounded up a few Next Fest gems on Bluesky</a>. Ryerson also mentioned <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3503810/TERRORtypeALCHEMY/">「TERROR」type:【A.L.C.H.E.M.Y.】</a>, which I'm quite drawn to despite its frightful typographical choices. Loosely, it's an immersive sim in which you play a bombmaker, mixing up reagents as you hurry through the shadows.</p>
<p>If you've taken a dislike to immersive sims, after watching Fennel turn guards into pretzels, maybe catch the demo for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3651950/Evil_Egg/">Evil Egg</a> - a coruscating shmup that puts me in mind of the old Macintosh hit Crystal Quest. Thanks Liz.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/samsung-pro-plus-microsd-card-with-adapter-drops-to-just-0-07-per-gb-likely-clearing-out-stock.1328014/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Running out of space as a creator or gamer is never ideal; it kills your momentum and affects your productivity. An easy way to make sure that never happens is to invest in a high-capacity, high-speed memory card. Right now, Amazon is offering a solid deal on one of the best in the category.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3897/">The Samsung Pro Plus 1TB microSD memory card plus adapter is down to $75, which is 38% off its regular price</a>. You’re saving $45 on a solution that fixes your storage problems for the long term, but the deal won’t be around for long. We suggest acting fast to grab it for less while you can.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3897/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Massive Storage Paired With Impressive Speeds</h2>
<p>1TB capacity is more than enough to house tons of high-resolution media content, games, important documents, programs, and so much more. You get read speeds up to 180MB/s and write speeds up to 130MB/s when used with compatible Samsung readers, meaning you won’t have to deal with frustrating wait times or an overall slow performance. If you’re using it with a GoPro or drone, these translate into smooth 4K UHD video capture and quicker burst shots. Even better, it is UHS-I, U3, V30, and A2 rated, so you can also run apps directly from the card on Android devices.</p>
<p>The included SD card plays nicely with your computer, handheld gaming console, tablet, drone, etc. Basically, if your device has a microSD or SD card slot, you’re good to go. Just note that this version isn’t compatible with the latest Nintendo Switch 2 yet.</p>



<p>The card is also built to last. It’s water, temperature, X-ray, magnet, drop, and wearout proof, so everyday wear and tear won’t affect the performance. It can handle a few splashes and drops without throwing a fit, which makes it great to take with you on the go.</p>
<p>In short, if you’re a creative, work professional, or just someone whose storage needs are growing and want a solution that won’t give up on you this is a smart pickup. The Samsung Pro Plus 1TB microSD offers the right mix of speed, performance, and space. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3897/">You really won’t have to deal with that “storage full” message for a while. It is now down to $75, after a whopping $45 discount.</a> We don’t see it go for less than $100 often, so this is definitely a rare sight. Just be sure to grab it for less while you can.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Japanese fans playing <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-legends-z-a">Pokémon Legends Z-A</a> have spotted a rare mention of Pikachu pooping. However, the game's English-language translation adjusts the dialogue — and instead simply references Pikachu experiencing "tummy troubles."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">According to <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/pokemon-legends-z-a-dialogue-confirms-that-pikachu-does-in-fact-poop/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Automaton</a>, "Pikachu's Poop" briefly trended on X for some Japanese users after the discovery of a Lumiose City NPC who mentions that their Pokémon is unwell. "Pikachu's pooping more than usual, I'm worried," the character reportedly says.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There's no follow-up dialogue, leaving players without any further detail on Pikachu's bowel habits. Nevertheless, the mention is notable, based on how infrequently Pokémon actually references the creatures' need to poop at all.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="ja" dir="ltr">ピカチュウのうんち <a href="https://t.co/rVetTHbftA" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/rVetTHbftA</a></p>— てそ (@teso_026) <a href="https://twitter.com/teso_026/status/1978541393812291872?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">October 15, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">The Pokémon series has occaisonally mentioned Pokémon droppings, suggesting that some species' poop makes for good fertilizer (Diglett), while other species' poop can be dangerously explosive (Turtonator). A particular favorite Pokédex of mine mentions the Fire-type creature Darumaka, whose "droppings are hot so people used to put them in their clothes to keep themselves warm." Lovely.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Back to Pikachu, though, and Pokémon Legends: Z-A's English translation of the above scene. As seen by IGN, the explicit mention of poop has been replaced with the following dialogue: "My Pikachu's been having tummy troubles recently. I'm worried..."</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/10/17/2025101710511600-406e08c26fae3d61e0fdd492a49b8d8e-1760716640663.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Pikachu is experiencing tummy troubles. Image credit: IGN/The Pokémon Company.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The English dialogue feels something of a santized take on the game's original script, though in keeping with a franchise about wild creatures that tries to skirt around some of the less family-friendly aspects of their lives whenever possible. Breeding, death and Pokémon eating other Pokémon as food are all canon within the franchise — though it's increasingly rare to hear these elements referenced in the series' games or anime.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Earlier today, IGN reported on a viral post <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/is-there-anything-more-cruel-japanese-pokmon-legends-z-a-players-are-debating-the-rights-and-wrongs-of-eating-food-in-front-of-your-pokmon">discussing whether Pokémon can eat food meant for humans</a> without getting some serious indigestion, sparked by the ability to take in-game photos of your character with their Pokémon hanging out in cafes.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">When contemplating the essence of a lighthouse (as one so often does), you might think of words like stoic, isolated, or purposeful. But have you ever thought of them as adorable, quirky, or perhaps even charming? Keeper, the atmospheric puzzle platformer from developer Double Fine, cleverly reimagines the often forgotten seaboard structure, reframing it as a lovably sentient scout on a journey through a living world. Blending a kaleidoscopic art style with nostalgic adventure game mechanics, Keeper hides an emotional story underneath all of its visual pizzazz, delivering a brain-tickling odyssey that’s stuck with me far beyond the credits. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">After being separated from its flock while evading a flood of evil batlike creatures, a seabird named Twig is drawn towards a dormant lighthouse that sits on the outskirts of a mythic island. Stagnant and alone, the unexpected visitor awakens the slumbering lighthouse, causing it to shoot out a beam of warming light and scare away the evil swarm. Keeper’s story is built around the soul-stirring relationship that evolves between this unlikely duo as they fight the island’s eerie infection, navigate its curious biomes, and attempt to climb its possessed, claw-like peak. Despite there not being a single line of dialogue across Keeper’s approximately six-hour run time, I found myself wholly invested in their plight – a testament to how dynamic the pair felt in motion.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Keeper Gameplay Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">It also helps that Keeper is one of the most visually interesting games I’ve ever played. The island's topology is wavy and confusing like an ant farm, with the towering summit somehow sitting at the edge of most frames, teasing you with its proximity. Every nook and cranny of its surreal, painterly world hides vast wells of depth with craggy coral, forgotten cave structures, and vibrant twisting vines intersecting like details in a Where’s Wally book. The use of fixed camera angles in Keeper is particularly inspired and evokes a cinematic atmosphere once cultivated by games like Grim Fandango and Silent Hill. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Keeper doesn’t explicitly explain the lore behind its mythical, post-apocalyptic setting, instead relying on visual clues like crumpled houses and rewilded cityscapes to create a sense of danger and scale. It’s helpful that the environments you saunter through blend seamlessly together, too, with a change in the orchestration and colour palette alerting you to a new area or checkpoint more often than a loading screen. This HUD-less approach better allows you to lose yourself in Keeper’s spectacular landscapes, increasing your investment in the twosome and encouraging you to play around with your powers and discover tidbits of lore littered throughout. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The HUD-less approach allows you to lose yourself in spectacular landscapes.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking of interacting with the world, your lighthouse powers are relatively limited but smartly utilized. You have the ability to shoot beams of light and run through obstacles to knock them down, as well as send your avian mate to pull vines or interact with levers to open doors. At first, the path forward is simple enough and involves using your light to grow vines into bridges or frighten creatures into dropping key items you need to progress. Gradually, though, Keeper increases its challenge, introducing a healthy mixture of logic and platforming puzzles that require you to weave a few interactions together in order to progress. One such puzzle involved finding and pulling a series of hidden levers to create a path through a rushing waterfall – to sniff out the levers, I needed to bound around the space and use my beam to explode fuzzy brain-like nodes, lower platforms, and grow patches of alien plants.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Not every reaction you can elicit serves a gameplay-specific purpose, though, and you can also wield these powers to impact the Seussian flora and fauna around you, using your light to make trees shift in color or shiver with life. Elsewhere, curious critters react with adorable animations along the edges of paths as you walk by. It can’t be overstated that almost every screenshot of Keeper effortlessly looks like a work of art. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">While your base skills remain largely the same throughout the story, the world changes in a way that keeps things fresh. For example, your humble torch can eventually activate strange monuments that twist time forwards and backwards, briefly turning Twig into a ghost that can fly through walls and rotate cogs or an egg that can weigh down pressure plates – who says you can’t teach an old building new tricks? </p><p data-cy="paragraph">If this sounds a bit surreal, that’s because it is, but somehow it all makes sense in the context of Keeper’s intriguing world. Admittedly, it helps that each new mechanic is so thoughtfully integrated into both the story and the worldbuilding at large, with Keeper peppering in subtle tutorials through a handful of unmissable interactions at the start of each new area. Similar to Cyan World’s groundbreaking puzzle game Myst, Double Fine masterfully teaches you how to solve the puzzles ahead without overexplaining them, which helps maintain a sense of momentum without leaving you totally untethered from the larger plot.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Jaw-dropping sights are further bolstered by an exquisite soundtrack.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Still, there’s no rush to make it to the top of the mountain. Half the joy of Keeper is in the journey, and there are plenty of jaw-dropping sights to gawk at along the way. Each level is its own microcosm screaming with personality. You’ll visit the ethereal Pollen Fields, which are filled with cotton candy shrubs and cliff faces that look like splodges of paint someone has haphazardly run their hands through, as well as the cleverly named Horologe, a steampunk-esque city that feels architecturally Grecian. These locations are often disorienting, with brush stroke detailing and scratchy textures that reinforce the organic, handmade aesthetic. They are further bolstered by an exquisite soundtrack from composer David Earl, whose twinkling, dreamy arrangements strike a steady balance between calming and eerie, coating the world in a sense of unease. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">That’s not all, though, as each area is inhabited by its own creatures, too, which range from towering multi-eyed whales to rocks with legs and narrow cylindrical dragons whose coats look like woven quilts. This smorgasbord of oddities made me feel like a kid at the aquarium, using my lighthouse torch to “tap at the glass” in search of reactions. Even with their uncanny designs, the critters all fit into Keeper’s world as if they evolved there over centuries in order to survive – a theme that bleeds into every corner of this existential story. 
</p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Sarah's favourite games with surreal settings</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The themes at play aren’t overly complex, though understanding them does require you to read between the lines. As a lonely lighthouse, the ideas of evolution and isolation are touched on – but importantly, your interpretation of each conversation-less cutscene or puzzle will surely be influenced by your own experiences in a way that feels intentional. For me, Keeper came across as an exploration of friendship, adaptation, and the inimitable power of self-belief in a world that is struggling to cope under an oppressive force. Maybe it will mean something different to you. While I was occasionally left longing for more concrete answers to its questions, similar to the process of staring at a painting, this tale leaves the door open for you to find meaning in both the artist's intentions as well as your own. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">I’ve always considered Double Fine the Willy Wonka of game developers, and Keeper feels like a prime example of why. It walks and talks like a fairly digestible adventure game, but there’s also a sense of experimentation and whimsy that makes it hard to put into any one box. Caught somewhere between the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8Yqw_f26SvM" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>‘Three Course Dinner Chewing Gum</u></a>’ and a <a href="https://youtu.be/lsEPqUmHDTo?t=28" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Ratatouille flashback</u></a>, Keeper flooded my senses, leaving me open to contemplate its world as a standalone creation as well as a mirror of my own. </p></section><div data-cy="verdict"><h3 data-cy="title3">Verdict</h3><p data-cy="article-verdict-paragraph">A surreal painting come to life, Keeper is a stunning puzzle game that carefully balances its moreish mechanics with a heartfelt story. Its levels are teeming with life to interact with and interesting objects to ogle, with each scene framed by a percussive driving score. The leading duo might not speak. But, well-executed animations and a soundboard of affecting chirps and creaks imbue them with a spirit that grows on you fast. Adorable in premise, Keeper is a psychedelic exploration of life packed into a brief runtime that’s well worth experiencing at least once in your lifetime.</p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/keeper-review]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Look out below! Team Meat's sadistic meat mascot is finally leaping into the third dimension with Super Meat Boy 3D, scheduled for early 2026 release on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series, and PC. It's a bold step forward for a series that originally started its life as a Flash-based sidescroller on Newgrounds, translating the blood-soaked precision platforming that defined the original 2010 cult classic into a fully three-dimensional space. Based on our hands-on time with the newest preview build, we can confidently say this isn't just the same old Super Meat Boy. Instead, it’s shaping up to be a thoughtful reimagining that captures the essence of what makes the series beloved while embracing new possibilities that only 3D can offer.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For those unfamiliar with the series, Super Meat Boy is a high-speed platformer that follows the adventures of a skinless protagonist attempting to rescue his girlfriend – Bandage Girl – from the villainous Dr. Fetus… a literal fetus in a jar with a perpetual grudge. Unlike the original game and its 2020 sequel, both of which are legendary for their punishing difficulty and death-defying speed, Super Meat Boy 3D feels less unfairly brutal and more <em>chill</em> while retaining some of the harder challenges for those who want to reclaim the series' hardcore platforming roots in 3D.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Super Meat Boy 3D Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The preview build on Steam opens with an eye-catching menu, and the interface is both immediately functional and slick-looking. One quick tap of the A button on your controller and you’re thrust into the action within seconds – but, if you linger in the main menu a bit longer, you may find yourself wandering into the robust settings menu, which reveals decently comprehensive accessibility options and good flexibility in the graphics department as well. It’s cool to see options to toggle on a ground distance helper, for instance, which projects where you'll land when airborne. There's also a replay character slider that determines how many ghostly versions of Meat Boy appear in the post-level replays, watching your recorded run play back alongside multiple failed attempts in swarms of up to 100 little guys.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The controls translate Super Meat Boy's responsive movement into 3D with surprising grace.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The controls translate Super Meat Boy's responsive movement into 3D with surprising grace. On an Xbox controller, jumping, sprinting, wall-running, and dashing all feel snappy and precise. Meat Boy does have a slightly floaty quality in midair that took a few untimely deaths to get the hang of, but a midair dash ability (default mapped to X) allows you to correct trajectory mistakes on the fly – a crucial addition given the added complexity of navigating 3D space. Wall-running and wall-jumping work similarly to the original's wall-slides, letting you bounce between vertical surfaces to reach higher platforms. Interestingly, the preview build lacks the punch ability mentioned in the control scheme and features no combat whatsoever, leaving us curious whether enemy encounters will play any role in the final release or if this remains a pure obstacle-course platformer.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">A Bloody Good Time</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">The level design effectively utilizes verticality in ways its 2D predecessors couldn't, with multi-tiered structures that had us jumping upward off walls, dashing across gaps, and ground-slamming down vertical shafts to avoid descending spike balls. The ground slam (mapped to B) proved more useful than we initially expected, letting us rapidly descend to dodge hazards that dropped from above. Environmental obstacles include classic platformer staples, like buzz saws, bear traps, crumbling platforms, and industrial crushers – alongside new physics-based challenges like the aforementioned spike balls, which drop into peculiarly-located chutes that require you first to bypass other obstacles and then properly time your descent to survive.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">True to series tradition, death comes frequently and gruesomely. As one might expect, Super Meat Boy 3D’s cube of exposed muscle tissue is prone to meeting countless splattery ends, immediately respawning him at the level start with the timer reset. The blood trail Meat Boy leaves on every surface he touches paints increasingly macabre patterns across the pastel environments with each attempt, and it's darkly comical watching pristine grassy fields transform into crime scenes. The sound design enhances this with squelchy, splattery audio that recalls Splatoon's ink-based aesthetic, while environmental sounds like the whir of saw blades and the mechanical grinding of crushers create an appropriately cartoony yet threatening audio landscape.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Film Study</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Performance is measured purely by completion time and death count, with letter grades awarded based on how quickly you reach each level's exit. An A+ rank requires finishing under a target time with zero deaths, which is a tall order that demands memorization and flawless execution. There's no score system, no collectible currency, just you versus the clock and your own mortality. We did discover hidden collectible band-aids tucked into secret areas behind destructible wooden walls, though their purpose remains unclear in the preview build. Whether they unlock content, costumes, or bonus levels in the full game is anyone's guess.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking of post-game content, the post-level replay system deserves special mention as one of the preview's most entertaining features. After completing a stage, you watch your successful run play back while multiple ghost versions of Meat Boy attempt the same route, most meeting horrible deaths before one mirror-image completes the course following your exact path. It's simultaneously satisfying and hilarious, transforming your hard-earned victories into miniature spectacles of failure. The max replay characters setting lets you crank this up, filling the screen with doomed meat cubes.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Who’s the Boss?</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">What's less clear is the scope of the full release. The preview build contained no boss fights (though a cutscene showed what appeared to be a giant robot), no multiplayer options, and a theater mode that remained inaccessible. The narrative setup – Dr. Fetus once again kidnapping someone dear to Meat Boy, this time appearing to be Bandage Girl based on her pink coloring – suggests we're returning to familiar story beats, though the series has never prioritized plot, and from what I’ve seen so far, that trend isn’t set to change with its first 3D outing. The linear level structure and lack of significant exploration or secret-hunting may disappoint players expecting more Metroidvania-style progression, though this has always been Super Meat Boy's MO: pure, distilled platforming challenge without excessive baggage.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Super Meat Boy 3D’s decently challenging and often enjoyable gameplay loop settles into a zen-like flow state once you accept the trial-and-error nature of mastery in its colorful world. This is very much a "podcast game" – something you can successfully zone out to while listening to something else, and by the fifth run through the preview build, we couldn’t help but think about how strong a fit it’ll be for Steam Deck owners who like to sneak in play sessions before bed. That's not necessarily criticism; there's value in games that don't demand your complete emotional investment, and this is undeniably one of those games. It’s just a shame that there’s no Switch 2 version currently announced. Half-joking!</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Nuts and Bolts</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">The difficulty, while present, didn’t reach the soul-crushing heights the series is notorious for, at least in these early stages, but that’s not such a bad thing to bring in a broader playerbase – as long as the final version still provides ample challenge to series fans. Whether that manifests in later worlds or if Team Meat has softened the challenge for broader appeal remains to be seen, but I’m hoping it's the former.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/10/16/smb3d-screenshot-2-1760658237906.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Graphically, Super Meat Boy 3D strikes a pleasing balance between the series' cartoonish aesthetic and modern rendering techniques for an increasingly atmospheric experience as the levels progress. The preview build already teases robust graphics options, including a nice list of anti-aliasing methods, post-processing effects, shadow quality, global illumination, reflections, and foliage density. While DLSS remained grayed out in my build, the game ran silky smooth at near-144fps on an RTX 4070Ti, with excellent optimization even at maximum settings on an ultrawide 3440x1440 display. The environments pop with visual personality: grassy starting areas give way to burning forests with spinning saw blades embedded in charred trees, which then transition into grimy industrial zones filled with crushers, spike-dropping machines, and pools of toxic waste. Everything maintains that high-contrast, storybook-meets-nightmare quality that defined the original, but with added geometric complexity and environmental detail that wouldn't be possible in 2D.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Bring the Pain</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Comparisons to other modern 3D platformers are inevitable, but may be a bit unfair to the scope that Super Meat Boy 3D is tackling. What we’ve played so far lacks Astro Bot's inventively kinetic mechanics and character-driven charm, Mario Odyssey's exploratory freedom, or even Crash Bandicoot 4's level design variety. Instead, Super Meat Boy 3D feels more akin to Ghost Runner's fast-paced, die-and-retry philosophy mixed with the geometric verticality and graphical style of Pac-Man World II – and then just heavily distilled from there, down to something much smaller and tighter, like a little cube of tightly-packaged meat in a convenience store freezer. There are no rings or coins to collect here: just brutal platforming, and this reinvention does it smoothly enough to feel satisfying even after several back-to-back runs of the same preview content.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/10/16/smb3d-screenshot-5-1760658250512.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Your skills will improve with each run, hitting more A+ ranks as your muscle memory develops. At least that addictive "just one more try" quality that defined the original is totally present here. The question is whether Team Meat can sustain that momentum across a full game, and whether enough content, variety, and surprises await in the final release to justify the journey into 3D.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Super Meat Boy 3D shows promise as a faithful translation of the series' darker cartoon comedy appeal into three dimensions, with responsive controls, strong performance, and level design that embraces verticality while maintaining the tight challenge loops that made the original special. But, at least at this point in its development cycle, significant questions remain about the scope of its content upon release, how well its combat will feel in action, what those hidden collectibles unlock, and if this tight-knit formula can stay fresh throughout a complete game.</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/super-meat-boy-3d-makes-great-use-of-its-extra-dimension]]></content:encoded>

<p>"I do also think there is an opportunity for those big players to also look to diversify into double-A and single-A, and then perhaps indie as well right?" she said. "And what size, shape, or form does that take? I don't know [...] but I think we need to look beyond the knee-jerk reaction of the pandemic and post-pandemic couple of years and really think about who do we want to be? What kind of product do we want to put out? We need to plot out intentionally how we're going to get there."</p><p>Morgan Juinio pointed specifically to games such as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/astro-bot/" data-ref-id="5000-630892">Astro Bot</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/split-fiction/" data-ref-id="5000-654965">Split Fiction</a>--two games that fit comfortably within the AA framework due to their smaller scope, shorter development, and scaled budget. Specifically, she mentioned that these games succeeded not just because of their non-AAA connection but also because they provided captivating and innovative gameplay that was more fascinating than what some (or even most) AAA games are currently offering. Also, these two games--Astro Bot and Split Fiction--are a bit cheaper than, say, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/battlefield-6/" data-ref-id="5000-687940">Battlefield 6</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-7/" data-ref-id="5000-681591">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</a>, which was another enticing element toward their commercial success. Consider that some analysts recently claimed that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/no-one-wants-a-100-gta-6-analysts-say/1100-6535494/" data-ref-id="1100-6535494">no one wants to spend $100 on a game</a>, let alone one as hyped as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/grand-theft-auto-vi/" data-ref-id="5000-569323">Grand Theft Auto 6</a>.</p><p>"What I believe is that we have to make great video games," she continued. "It doesn't matter what shape. I think gamers right now are a little bit desensitized to beautiful graphics and size and scale and scope. It's almost a given, right? If a game isn't fun, it doesn't matter how pretty it is. If a game isn't engaging or delivering some hook, then it's not going to connect with players."</p><p>There's a lot of doom and gloom around the games industry as of late. Games are becoming more expensive. Developers are losing jobs. And, oh no, shareholders are unhappy with the sales of their expensive games. It's easy to feel defeated as someone who works in the games industry. Still, Morgan Juinio is "an eternal glass-half-full type thinker" and believes that, as long as creativity and innovation continue to persist, there will be structural changes that will benefit everyone writ large--particularly if publishers invest in smaller projects more.</p><p>"I think the very nature of who we are, as developers and creators, won't allow it to stay doom and gloom. They won't accept that state of the world," she explained. "Does that mean, though, that we're going to go back to the types of games that came out five years ago or during the pre-pandemic times? No. I think it's going to be something new. We don't know yet what it is, but I inherently believe in the power of creativity and innovation in our industry. And I believe that even if the powers that be structurally change or completely get upended, there is still a demand out there for great games."</p>

            <link>https://aftermath.site/hearthstone-union-blizzard</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/big-week-for-unions-at-blizzard-as-hearthstone-team-also-votes-%E2%80%98yes%E2%80%99.1327990/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Blizzard Entertainment's Team 5—responsible for the development of <em>Hearthstone</em>—is unionizing. A group of around 100 workers voted yes to representation with the Communications Workers of America under CWA Local 9510. It's the third union to go public at Blizzard this week, following <a href="https://aftermath.site/battle-net-workers-unionize-blizzard-entertainment-cwa" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">two new units</a> composed of Blizzard Entertainment's Battle.net workers.</p><p>The <em>Hearthstone</em> union includes people from many different roles across the game's development, including artists, gameplay designers, and quality assurance testers. Microsoft has recognized the union after workers voted earlier this week; Microsoft and CWA's neutrality agreement, which was signed in 2022 ahead of Microsoft's $68.7 billion acquisition of Activision Blizzard and prevented the company from interfering in union efforts, expired on Monday. Several unions formed under Activision Blizzard before the neutrality agreement was signed, but they faced what workers <a href="https://cwa-union.org/news/releases/national-labor-relations-board-finds-merit-charges-against-blizzard-illegal-union" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">called union-busting</a>—attempts to shut down union efforts. Since the signing, workers have voted to unionize across the company; there are at least seven separate union groups at Blizzard Entertainment alone.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Hearthstone</em> workers made a big push to unionize their own department about three months ago, senior 2D artist Uriah Voth told Aftermath. The deadline for the neutrality agreement's expiration was a big motivator to get the union finalized, workers said.&nbsp;</p><p>"One important moment was learning about the neutrality agreement and its deadline, and seeing the union busting that is and has happened at other very large companies," senior game designer Dominic Calkosz said. "Being owned now by Microsoft has always been a looming question of, <em>will things change? How will things change? How should we be prepared or react to those changes?</em> Knowing there is a date where this powerful option of forming a union may become significantly more difficult was a wake up call to me that, alright, we should start moving now."</p><p>Carol Blean, <em>Hearthstone</em> test analyst, told Aftermath that the agreement allowed the <em>Hearthstone</em> workers to openly talk about the union. "You [usually] have to be very hushed about it. You [usually] have to be very secretive," she said. "Fear hasn't been looming as much, because we have been very open about it, very supported, and everyone has been very respectful."</p><p>She continued: "We all share common struggles, so it's easy to keep supporting each other, not just in the product that we create, but in our own choices."</p><p>Workers don't know how things will change for unionizing at Microsoft game studios now that the neutrality agreement has expired. The unions that exist now, including Team 5's, are past the major hurdle of an election and recognition from the company, but neutrality agreements typically don't extend to the next steps of union effort, negotiating for a contract. Now, the <em>Hearthstone</em> union’s organizing committee will poll the group to determine what the most important issues are for staff to guide them in bargaining a contract. So far, just two of the many unions under Microsoft and Activision Blizzard have completed negotiations, <a href="https://cwa-union.org/news/releases/raven-software-workers-secure-first-contract-microsoft" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Raven Software</a> and <a href="https://aftermath.site/zenimax-union-contract" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ZeniMax QA workers</a>. Both groups were in negotiations for years.</p><p>Voth said that layoff protections are something that motivated him to get involved in the union. He's been at Blizzard Entertainment for two and a half years and has experienced three rounds of layoffs that impacted <em>Hearthstone</em> team members. "It was just this every six month cadence of experiencing this traumatic event," he said. "I looked into the union stuff, and I know that we can't fully stop layoffs from happening, but just the feeling that we need to have some say in these massive decisions that are affecting all of us."</p><p>It didn't feel like leadership was listening, the workers said—a union is a collective voice they can't ignore. "I cannot face everything by myself," Blean said. "We all share the same struggles." She described the "passion tax" that people often take when coming to jobs at places like Blizzard, because they're often dream jobs. But these companies, at the end of the day, are still corporations. "We're looking for just treatment," Blean said. "And right now, we don't have much of a say. That's what we're looking for."</p><p>Calkosz listed a number of things the union is interested in negotiating over, including layoff protections like improved severance packages and recall rights, reduced wage gaps, more support for work from home, formal protections for remote workers, accountability for harassment, and protections or limitations on AI usage.&nbsp;</p><p>"More generally, being able to preserve the good things that we have and being prepared to push back against future unfair treatment," Calkosz said. "Over the months and years, there will be things that upper leadership may have done that they choose not to do because they know we have solidarity now."</p><p>The workers said they're very grateful for the unions that came before them at Blizzard. Members of the organizing committees across unions meet weekly to talk and share information. "We were trying to get this done by the end of the neutrality agreement, and it was really because of the work that other unions had done before us," Voth said. "They were able to help us figure out how to best strategize and get the message out to our team."</p><p>Union influence is apparent even outside of that coordination–simply existing is a motivating factor. "It has been tremendously helpful for members of our team, of our unit, to see other teams at Blizzard union and make steps toward the contract and other things that they want," Calkosz said. "It's very difficult to take the first step or take that leap. Just knowing there are others already paving that way, and ready for solidarity with our team as well, has been motivating for a lot of people."</p><p>He continued: "It's been a little scary to not know how the company might react or retaliate. It helps a ton that other Blizzard teams and other developers have paved the way for us, but a bit of fear is still there. It's helped to remind myself that for [the company] to retaliate would be wrong, and so for us to obey in advance would be wrong. The other Blizzard developers helped pave the way for us. I hope we can help pave the way for other companies, especially being such a visible triple A studio."</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/battlefield-6-campaign-singleplayer-review-impressions"><h3>Battlefield 6’s Campaign Is An Act Of Narrative Cowardice</h3></a><p>The only thing worse than saying something stupid is saying nothing at all</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/imdb-review-scale-bad-broken"><h3>The Sweet Spot Of IMDb Is 6.3-7.6&nbsp;</h3></a><p>Please enjoy my arbitrary and unscientific system for accounting for IMDb's awful rating scale.</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/battle-net-workers-unionize-blizzard-entertainment-cwa"><h3>Battle.net Workers Unionize As Microsoft Neutrality Agreement Expires</h3></a><p>Nearly 400 workers formed two units under Blizzard Entertainment's Platform and Technology department</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/bus-bound-demo"><h3>Look Out, I’m The Bus</h3></a><p>The Bus Bound demo is pretty fun</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div><br/><br/>https://aftermath.site/hearthstone-union-blizzard]]></content:encoded>

At least not the mainline games or direct spin-offs.</p>
<p>For many, especially those who have been with the series since the very beginning, this hasn't really been much of an issue. After all, it was only when Pokémon had properly transitioned into the 3D realm with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/3ds/pokemon_x_and_y">X and Y</a> that characters actually started articulating their joints while talking, and even then it was <em>very</em> limited.</p>
<p>With <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pokemon-legends-z-a-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a>, however, it feels a bit different. Yes, visuals are still somewhat lacklustre across the board with this latest entry, but character animation, particularly during cutscenes, is actually pretty good. They move like real people are supposed to, and their mouths are lip-synced with the dialogue.</p><div><figure data-videoid="2LcP6TZzqhM" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2LcP6TZzqhM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/2LcP6TZzqhM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2LcP6TZzqhM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed635c59onrvkw&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>836k</span></a></p>

<p>The problem..? There's no verbal audio to go with the dialogue. It's <em>still</em> completely silent.</p>
<p>It's pretty noticeable in the below clip doing the rounds on social media, with many noting that supporting character Taunie animates well, but the lack of any voice-over makes it come off a bit, well... weird:</p>

<p>Heck, our <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/pokemon-legends-z-a-nintendo-switch-2-edition">final verdict</a> on Legends: Z-A even highlighted the lack of any voice-over work, with reviewer Alana Hagues stating the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"I know this is controversial, too, but voices would help give this game character. I’m not even asking for full voice acting — though monologues and pre-rendered cutscenes feel utterly bizarre as just text on a screen — but I’d love a voice clip or two, along the lines of modern Zelda games. It’d also help give the story a little more <em>oomph</em>, which it needs when focusing on friendship, recovery, and forgiveness. Even with an explosive climax (which I urge you not to spoil yourself on), I felt... nothing."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>So now we'd like to put it to you fine folks. Is Legends: Z-A worse off without any voice-over work? Should Game Freak endeavour to add this into future titles? Let us know by voting in the below polls and sharing a comment in the usual place.</p>

			<p>The<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/demons-souls-polishing-diamond/"> Demon's Souls PlayStation 5 remake</a> has been updated to <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-september-17-system-software-update/">support the system's Power Saver Mode</a>, and the performance and resolution tweaks, and the reduced system power consumption may be the first glimpse at what the <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-6-playstation-handheld-specs-leaked-rasterization-performance/">rumored PlayStation handheld could deliver</a> running PS5 games.</p>



<p>The remake developed by Bluepoint Games, which launched with the PlayStation 5 in November 2020, has now been updated to support the new Power Saver Mode, as indicated by the little leaf icon on the system's main menu. Introducing this mode, which reduces the system's power consumption, is SIE's commitment to Sony's <a href="https://www.sony.com/en/SonyInfo/csr/eco/RoadToZero/gm_en.html">"Road to Zero"</a> environmental plan launched in 2010, which includes achieving net-zero greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 2040.</p>

<h2 id="h-demon-s-souls-remake-power-saver-mode-screenshots-and-performance">Demon's Souls Remake Power Saver Mode Screenshots and Performance </h2>



<p>Although Power Saver mode has been <span>officially implemented on PS5 as part of a b</span>igger environmental effort,&nbsp;it has long been speculated&nbsp;that its implementation and limitations could be <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-power-saver-mode-impact-performance-significantly-handheld/">a testing ground for the rumored PlayStation handheld</a>, which is <a href="https://wccftech.com/portable-playstation-6-ps5-games-patch/">allegedly going to run PS5 games as well</a>.</p>



<p>The performance and resolution tweaks introduced in Demon's Souls remake definitely support this theory in part, at the very least. As can be seen from this set of screenshots I have captured from my launch PlayStation 5 at the start of the game, the resolution in Power Saver mode is lower than the resolution of both Performance and Cinematic display modes, even at a quick glance.</p>

<p>The frame rate target of the game's has also been changed for Power Saver mode, going from the 60 FPS of Performance Mode to 30 FPS. The video shared on YouTube by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@user-el8fc5xg9h">?.?</a> accurately represents the experience, which is not the best for a home console for this type of game, but that wouldn't be terribly bad on a handheld gaming system.</p>

<h2 id="h-demon-s-souls-remake-power-saver-mode-reduced-energy-usage">Demon's Souls Remake Power Saver Mode Reduced Energy Usage</h2>



<p>Power Saver Mode delivers impressive reductions in energy usage as well. <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/ps5-to-recieve-power-saving-mode-which-will-scale-back-performance-on-compatible-games-rumored-to-be-used-as-upcoming-portables-power-target.1250814/page-5#post-146505994">In a test conducted by ResetERA forums member vicegold</a>, power consumption went from hovering at ~224 W in the regular operating mode to ~98 W with power saver mode, which is quite a big difference. While this power consumption target is way too high for a handheld gaming system, the fact that the game wasn't horribly downgraded to achieve it with some software tweaks bodes quite well for the rumored handheld, which would require games to be tweaked similarly to run well on it.</p>



<p>The Demon's Souls remake is only one of the PlayStation 5 games that will be patched to support Power Saver mode. Among other titles to support the feature will be Death Stranding 2: On The Beach, which will be another interesting game to test, given its <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-review-in-progress-one-more-for-the-road/">solid 60 FPS performance and high-quality visuals.</a></p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dead-space-creator-pitched-new-dead-space-to-ea</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dead-space-creator-glen-schofield-pitched-a-new-game-in-the-series-to-ea-recently.1327972/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Dead Space&nbsp;</em>creator Glen Schofield has revealed that he pitched a new game in the series to EA "recently", and that while the studio rejected his pitch, he's optimistic that the series may have a future.</p>

<p>That's according to an interview with <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/i-can-save-you-30-40-million-on-the-idea-i-have-dead-space-creator-glen-schofield-already-making-calls-about-dead-space-4-now-ea-has-new-owners" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">IGN</a>, in which Schofield says he "went to [EA] recently" and that they told him they were "not interested anymore" when it came to&nbsp;<em>Dead Space</em>, despite his assertions that he could "save [the company] $30 to $40 million on the idea that [he has]".</p>

<p>Schofield then says that he's got "quite a few ideas", presumably for several different games, but that "one of them is&nbsp;<em>Dead Space 4</em>". He points to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ea-could-go-private-powered-by-saudi-and-private-equity-money" rel="nofollow">EA's recent purchase by a consortium of investors</a> as an "opportunity" and says he's "already making calls".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dead-space-glen-schofield-isaac.jpg?itok=JC4SEM4c 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dead-space-glen-schofield-isaac.jpg?itok=0qJX5Pzu 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Glen Schofield wants a new&nbsp;<em>Dead Space&nbsp;</em>to happen.</figcaption></figure><p>It's not just EA Schofield wants to revive&nbsp;<em>Dead Space</em>, though; he also reckons that with the studio's purchase, "somebody new could buy [the IP]", so it might not even be EA that releases the eventual&nbsp;<em>Dead Space 4</em>.</p>

<p>He also says he wants the franchise to branch out into "different mediums", suggesting that movies or a TV series based on&nbsp;<em>Dead Space&nbsp;</em>could be "great".</p>

<p>Still, Schofield says he doesn't think EA made a profit from the 2023&nbsp;<em>Dead Space&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/dead-space" rel="nofollow">remake</a>, which is presumably why the company is so reticent to do anything new with the IP. Here's hoping it finds its way into the hands of someone who wants to use it for good.</p>

<p>The aforementioned remake is the last major project to be released in the&nbsp;<em>Dead Space&nbsp;</em>series. It's a ground-up rework of the 2008 original, adding new story scenes and gameplay mechanics to the first game's tale of spindly Necromorphs and sinister Markers.</p>




<p>Schofield himself wasn't involved in that remake, though; while it was in development, he was working on&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/callisto-protocol" rel="nofollow">The Callisto Protocol</a>&nbsp;</em>alongside Striking Distance Studios, although he <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dead-space-co-creator-pursuing-new-opportunities-less-than-year-after-callisto" rel="nofollow">departed the developer</a> less than a year after that game's release.</p>

<p>Subsequently, back in February, it was revealed that Striking Distance had <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/striking-distance-layoffs-callisto-protocol" rel="nofollow">laid off "most" of its employees</a>, so it sounds as though Schofield may have been right to make his exit when he did.</p>

<p>We'll have to wait and see whether Glen Schofield's&nbsp;<em>Dead Space&nbsp;</em>pitch manages to get anywhere in the future, but for now, you can (and should) grab the&nbsp;<em>Dead Space&nbsp;</em>remake on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1693980/Dead_Space/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/dead-space/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/dead-space/9nlb6v0gnc9p" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/silent-hill-2-remake-sales-2-5m-worldwide</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/silent-hill-2-remake-sales-reach-2-5m-worldwide.1327969/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Konami has revealed that its survival horror remake&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill 2</em>, which was developed by Bloober Team, has hit another big sales milestone.</p>

<p>As spotted by <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2025/10/silent-hill-2-remake-shipments-and-digital-sales-top-2-5-million" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Gematsu</a>,&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill 2&nbsp;</em>has now sold 2.5 million copies worldwide (inclusive of both digital and physical shipments), which means the game has picked up another half a million sales for itself <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/silent-hill-2-remake-sales-2m" rel="nofollow">since January this year</a>. That's pretty good going for what is, in the end, a fairly niche title.</p>

<p>Although&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill 2&nbsp;</em>is still selling steadily for Konami, it wasn't able to hold a candle to recent release&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill f&nbsp;</em>in the initial sales stakes; the latter outpaced the remake significantly, racking up <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/silent-hill-f-sales-1m" rel="nofollow">a million sales in a single day</a>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/silent-hill-2-sales-2.5m-typewriter.jpg?itok=wOiAtzo5 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/silent-hill-2-sales-2.5m-typewriter.jpg?itok=4ffEDVmj 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Silent Hill 2&nbsp;</em>is going strong for Konami.</figcaption></figure><p>As well as the milestone for&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill 2</em>, Konami also announced that the series as a whole has reached ten million cumulative sales, and since 2.5 million of those are&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill 2</em>&nbsp;(and a further million belong to&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill f</em>), the franchise can reasonably call itself resurgent.</p>

<p>These numbers will bode well for Konami's future franchise plans as well. The studio is currently working alongside&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill 2&nbsp;</em>remake developer Bloober Team on a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/konami-bloober-team-new-silent-hill" rel="nofollow">reimagining of the first game</a>, although no release date or gameplay have yet been revealed.</p>

<p>As for&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill 2</em>, it's a remake of the 2001 survival horror classic, shifting the action from the fixed camera angles of the original to a more modern over-the-shoulder perspective and adding new story scenes for additional context.</p>

<p>At its core, though,&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill 2&nbsp;</em>still tells the same story of James Sunderland, who travels to the titular town of Silent Hill in order to investigate a letter he receives from his deceased wife.</p>




<p>You can check out the&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill 2&nbsp;</em>remake right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2124490/SILENT_HILL_2/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a> and <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/silent-hill-2/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>.

            <title><![CDATA[Nintendo Reportedly Asking Manufacturers to Produce 25m Switch 2 Units By March]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/switch-2-25m-production-report</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nintendo-reportedly-asking-manufacturers-to-produce-25m-switch-2-units-by-march.1327966/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A new report has emerged which claims that Nintendo is instructing manufacturers to produce a pretty staggering number of Switch 2 consoles by the end of March next year, indicating that the Japanese gaming giant is expecting a bumper sales year.</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-10-17/nintendo-switch-2-production-plan-25-million-units-by-march-2026" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Bloomberg</a>, Nintendo has asked its suppliers to produce "as many as 25 million" Switch 2 units prior to March 2026, which, as Bloomberg points out, will set Nintendo up for "record first-year sales" of its console.</p>

<p>Additionally, Bloomberg notes that according to industry analysts, Nintendo is on track to "comfortably surpass" previous projections of 17.6 million Switch 2 sales within the console's first fiscal year, potentially reaching the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-20m-shipments-report" rel="nofollow">20 million target reported back in January</a>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/nintendo-switch-2-manufacturing-25m-report-console.jpg?itok=KRTdcBZR 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/nintendo-switch-2-manufacturing-25m-report-console.jpg?itok=xE9UwGDr 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Nintendo is expecting the Switch 2 to do pretty well, it seems.</figcaption></figure><p>It's worth noting that this is a report, and as Bloomberg itself notes, it's possible the figure will be adjusted in the near future, especially as the holiday season approaches and Nintendo gets a better understanding of what demand for the Switch 2 looks like.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, it's probably fair to say the Switch 2 has already been a major success for Nintendo. Just a couple of months after the console's release, it <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-financials-q1-2026" rel="nofollow">hit six million sales</a> around the world, having already secured the position of Nintendo's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/switch-2-fastest-selling-nintendo-console" rel="nofollow">fastest-selling console worldwide</a>.</p>

<p>Nintendo itself has stated that it <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-15m-switch-2-first-year" rel="nofollow">expects to sell around 15 million</a> Switch 2 consoles in the machine's first year on release, but there's every chance that figure could be revised (either upwards or downwards) soon.</p>

<p>The console's sales numbers have no doubt been buoyed by the release of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mario-kart-world-switch-2-launch-title" rel="nofollow">a new&nbsp;<em>Mario Kart&nbsp;</em>game at launch</a>, as well as flagship 3D platformer&nbsp;<em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em>, which may not be a&nbsp;<em>Mario&nbsp;</em>game but which <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/donkey-kong-bananza-super-mario-odyssey-team" rel="nofollow">bears the hallmarks of the&nbsp;<em>Super Mario Odyssey&nbsp;</em>team</a> nonetheless.</p>




<p>We'll have to wait and see whether Nintendo achieves its ambitious sales targets for the Switch 2, but current signs look pretty positive. Stay tuned for more on this one.</p>

Both have a comfortable fit, active noise cancellation, great sound quality, and their USB-C transmitters work with every non-Xbox platform in my apartment. But it’s easy to tell you which of the two you should buy right now, if you’re in the market: SteelSeries’ Arctis Buds in white with PlayStation wireless connectivity are down to $127.99 ($73 off) at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0DFX34VNZ/?th=1&amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">Amazon</a> — their best price yet. (This model originally sold for $159.99, but it was likely increased due to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/604742/trump-tariffs-canada-mexico-china-updates">increased tariffs</a>). Even so, they’re considerably cheaper than Sony’s <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Wireless-Cancelling-Earbuds-WF-G700N/dp/B0CJHB7B59?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">$228</a> InZone Buds.</p><p>The Arctis Buds can connect to one of many devices with its 2.4GHz transmitter, from your PC, Mac, PlayStation 5, and Nintendo Switch 2. (A <a rel="sponsored" href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0DFX4TPS6/?th=1&amp;tag=theverge02-20">pricier $165.99 version</a> in black works with Xbox and all of the aforementioned platforms.) If you need them more as earbuds for joining a call or listening to a podcast from your phone, you can pair them via Bluetooth 5.3. Whether you’re gaming or jamming away, these feature active noise cancellation to block out more sound. They have a transparency mode, too, letting you hear more of your surroundings.</p><p>Some additional perks include its Qi wireless case, which can recharge on the same wireless charging pad you might use for your AirPods Pro or a different set of earbuds. The earbuds can last about 10 hours per charge, slightly less if you’re using active noise cancellation. (Our reviewer Tom Warren got nine hours of life from them with ANC on.) Almost every set of wireless earbuds has limitations, and this model’s biggest one is that it can’t pipe in audio from its 2.4GHz and Bluetooth connections simultaneously. It’s one or the other.</p><div><form><div><h2>Verge Deals</h2><p><span>Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we’ve tested sent to your inbox weekly.</span></p></div></form></div><div><p id="some-other-deals-for-your-friday"><h2>Some other deals for your Friday</h2></p></div><div><ul><li><span>Amazon Prime members who are building a PC or just looking for deals on midrange GPUs can save on <strong>MSI’s RTX 5070</strong> with 12GB of VRAM. The GPU had an original MSRP of $549, but this two-fan model is selling for $499.99 at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/MSI-RTX-5070-12G-Performance/dp/B0DYGFJK7C?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">Amazon</a>, which is its lowest price yet. The Shadow 2X OC has a slightly faster 2,557MHz boost clock speed versus Nvidia’s Founders Edition model, and its design is slightly more compact (but more plastic-laden). It’s otherwise the same in terms of ports (three DisplayPort 2.1a, one HDMI 2.1b) and capabilities. It’s a solid GPU for playing most games at 1440p with respectable frame rates, even if turning on DLSS 4 is necessary to get the super-fast performance you may be hoping for.</span></li><li><span>Lego’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/1/24169526/lego-minecraft-the-crafting-table-15th-anniversary-adult-set">first <em>Minecraft</em> set for adults</a>, <strong>The Crafting Table</strong>, is down to an all-time low of $71.99 ($18 off) at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/LEGO-Minecraft-Crafting-Collectible-Anniversary/dp/B0CRX64YFN/?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">Amazon</a> and <a href="https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Flego-minecraft-21265%2F-%2FA-90573727" rel="sponsored">Target</a>. The 1,195-piece kit essentially resembles an in-game crafting table on the outside, but inside, you’ll find a slick little diorama with 12 brick-ified biomes — including a village-laden Plains and Cherry Grove, which features an abandoned mineshaft. You also get eight tiny microfigures, because what’s <em>Minecraft</em> without a Creeper?</span></li><li><span>Those who are hoping to get a 55-inch 4K OLED TV for well under $1,000 won’t find many models out there at that price point. However, you can still take advantage of the <a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FLG-55-Class-4K-UHD-OLED-Web-OS-Smart-TV-with-Dolby-Vision-B4-Series-OLED55B4PUA%2F5446374203" rel="sponsored">Walmart-exclusive deal</a> on the <strong>55-inch LG B4</strong>. You can get it for $798, which is about $200 less than the price you can typically find it available for. Even though the B-series is LG’s entry-level OLED model, it has some of the most important traits in common with its pricier next of kin; you’ll get four HDMI 2.1 ports, allowing any of them to display your games in 4K at up to 120Hz, if supported. Plus, it supports variable refresh rate (VRR), which allows the panel’s refresh rate to stay in lockstep with the connected gaming device’s output to eliminate the chance of screen tearing. For movie lovers, this TV supports Dolby Vision, HDR10 and HLG, ensuring that most of your content will pop with color.</span></li></ul></div><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTU2Ng=="><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Cameron Faulkner</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/tech/801041/steelseries-arctis-buds-rtx-5070-gpu-deal-sale]]></content:encoded>

It’s a new take on Mattel’s Intellivision, which initially went head-to-head with the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/8/22/23841336/atari-2600-plus-compatible-with-7800-cartridges">Atari 2600</a> when it was released in 1979.</p><p>The Sprint looks a lot like the original Intellivision with a gold and black case and a wood-grain panel on the front, but there are a lot fewer cables. It connects to a TV using a single HDMI cable, and while it still includes two controllers featuring dials and number pads instead of joysticks, they’re both wireless and charge when docked to the console.</p><p>The Sprint has the original Intellivision’s number pad overlays, but with new designs and updated artwork to make it easier to know what buttons you need to press to play different games. It comes with 45 built-in titles, including classics like <em>Boulder Dash</em> and <em>Astrosmash</em>, plus a collection of sports games that helped popularize the original version of the console. It lacks support for cartridges, but there’s USB-A ports that can be used to play additional titles or to connect original Intellivision controllers with an adapter.</p><p>It’s available for preorder starting today for $149.99 and is expected to ship on December 5th, 2025.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTYw"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Andrew Liszewski</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/801646/atari-intellivision-sprint-console-competition]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/forget-subscriptions-microsoft-office-2021-lifetime-license-windows-and-mac-is-almost-free-with-over-80-off-2000636222</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/forget-subscriptions-microsoft-office-2021-lifetime-license-windows-and-mac-is-almost-free-with-over-80-off.1327951/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Unless you have some crazy level of self-discipline or a truly superior bookkeeping system, you’re probably drowning in subscriptions like the rest of us. Those monthly bills are always an unpleasant surprise, so when you get a chance to ditch one for good, you take it. Here’s one to convert into a one-and-done purchase — <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4845/">a lifetime license to Microsoft Office Pro 2021 for Windows is just $40 at StackSocial.</a> You can also get the Home &amp; Business for Mac version for just $60 on the same StackSocial page.</p>
<p>Rather than deal with that monthly line in your bank statement, this one-time $40 buy gives you a lifetime license to the world’s preeminent productivity suite: Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook, OneNote, Access, Publisher, and Teams. This StackSocial deal is a massive 81% markdown from the list price of $220, and more importantly, you can drop that Microsoft 365 subscription once and for all now that you own all of the apps forever.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4845/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at StackSocial</a></p>

<h2>Accept No Substitutes</h2>
<p>There are other apps and programs out there for all of the tasks covered by the Microsoft Office Pro 2021 suite, but if you’re looking to share important data analysis, would you even think about sending it in a format other than Excel? Or an interactive slideshow presentation in anything other than PowerPoint, or a written document that’s not in Word?</p>
<p>These Microsoft apps have been the global standard for productivity for decades now, in no small part because Microsoft is continually updating and refining them. All of those updates are included in this lifetime license deal, and they’re automatically pushed out to your computer once you’ve installed and registered the suite.</p>



<h2>Easy to Install</h2>
<p>Getting your lifetime license to Microsoft Office Pro 2021 for WIndows or Office Home &amp; Busniness for Mac is easy. Just make the purchase on StackSocial’s site, and you’ll get a download code and your license keys via email. You must redeem the code within 7 days of receiving it by downloading and installing the software and registering it using the license key. (Keep that in a safe place in case you need to reinstall the software on a new computer at some point down the road; the license is good for only 1 computer at a time.)</p>
<p>Ditching a subscription model for Microsoft Office access won’t solve all of your subscription issues, but it might be the only one you can say goodbye to with a one-time lifetime license purchase for just $40. That is, unless you wait too long and <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4845/">this sweet 81%-off deal on a lifetime license to Microsoft Office Pro 2021 for WIndows (or 72% off Microsoft Office Home &amp; Business for Mac) ends</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>A new update on the lawsuit reveals that Sony has filed a motion for a preliminary injunction to stop Tencent from using Aloy’s resemblance and other elements from the Horizon series. </p>



<p>Sony Interactive Entertainment has filed a case against Tencent for copyright and trademark infringement in a California federal court. The company has already called the accused’s upcoming title a “<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sony-calls-tencents-defense-in-horizon-clone-lawsuit-nonsense/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">blatant knock-off</a>” after their <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tencent-claps-back-at-sony-playstations-horizon-clone-lawsuit/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">motion to dismiss</a>. Now, Sony is seeking an injunction. </p>



<h2 id="h-sony-wants-to-hold-a-hearing-next-month">Sony Wants to Hold a Hearing Next Month </h2>



<p>According to a report by <a href="https://gamesfray.com/breaking-sony-asks-judge-corley-for-preliminary-injunction-against-tencents-upcoming-light-of-motiram-in-november-or-december/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Games Fray</a>, Sony is seeking a preliminary injunction in the Horizon clone lawsuit against Tencent. The motion is to stop Tencent “from reproducing, preparing derivative works of, displaying, performing, and distributing any works copied or derived from SIE’s Horizon Works, including Light of Motiram, and from using the ALOY Character Mark or any confusingly similar mark pending trial.”</p>



<p>Coming to what the Aloy Character Mark is, “she is a young and fierce tribal warrior huntress characterized by fiery red hair, high cheekbones, and outfits that blend tribal and industrial metallic elements.” The injunction also seeks to stop Tencent from using visual, audio, and storyline elements from the Horizon series.</p>



<p>Sony has asked Judge Jacqueline Scott Corley, from the FTC v. Microsoft-Activision Blizzard case, to hold a hearing by November 20, 2025. The company wants a decision by the end of that month or in December. Sony has also added several sworn declarations along with the personal injunction, which includes statements from Guerrilla Games Studio and Art Director Jan-Bart van Beek, the studio’s music lead Lucas van Tol, PlayStation Productions head Asad Qizilbash, and Sony brand IP director Matthew Kuykendall.</p>



<p>In other news, Horizon Zero Dawn movie plans to start shooting in 2026 and is <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/horizon-zero-dawn-movie-planned-to-release-in-2027-court-documents-reveal/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">targeting a 2027 release</a>. Additionally, Tencent had responded to Sony’s copyright and trademark infringement lawsuit with a&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tencent-claps-back-at-sony-playstations-horizon-clone-lawsuit/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">motion to dismiss</a>.

<p>Plants vs. Brainrots pays homage to the classic Plants vs. Zombies tower defence title. In this Roblox experience, instead of fighting zombies with plants, you’ll battle waves of Brainrots, collect them, and place the best ones on platforms to generate passive income. However, to defeat and obtain Limited, Secret, Godly, and Mythic Brainrots, you’ll need the help of the active Plants vs. Brainrots codes.</p>



<p>These <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/jump-and-splash-codes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Roblox</a> codes can be redeemed for free Gears, Potions, and Money, which in turn will help you expand your garden, purchase new platforms, and fill your Index with every Brainrot and Plant available. Become the richest defender on the map by redeeming the featured active codes below.</p>

            <p>The Arc Raiders server slam has begun. The much-anticipated third-person extraction shooter has only been available to play for roughly two hours (at time of writing), and it's already nearing 100,000 concurrent players.</p>
<p>This server slam is the final chance for interested players to check the game out before it launches on the 30th October, at which point you'll have to buy the game for £30.99 / $39.99 / €39.99. The purpose of this test is, as the name implies, to push the servers as hard as possible before the full release.</p>
<p>Arc Raiders already had a public test back in April. It was hard to account for how popular the test was, given its multi-platform availability. Instead, it's perhaps better to compare today's weekend play test to other games' recent open betas.</p>

<p>Compare it to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dune-awakening">Dune: Awakening</a>. This game was a massive presence on Steam during its open beta, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dune-awakening-hits-142000-concurrent-players-during-full-launch-smashing-past-record">quickly reaching roughly 150,000 concurrent users on Steam on its opening day</a>. Arc Raiders looks to be on track to pass the bar Dune: Awakening set, a good indicator of its popularity.</p><p>It is of course unfair to compare Arc Raiders to the most recent beta powerhouse of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-6-has-almost-250000-people-waiting-in-an-open-beta-queue">which had 250,000 players <em>waiting</em> to play in its open beta across all platforms</a>. Now, no one is expecting Arc Raiders to hit that level of popularity during a weekend play test, but peeking at where it lands this weekend between Dune: Awakening and Battlefield 6 could give a glimpse as to its eventual popularity when it goes premium.</p>
<p>These are, of course, different genres of games which must be taken into account. As an extraction game, Arc Raiders' biggest competitors are likely Escape From Tarkov, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/escape-from-tarkov-is-coming-to-steam">which is set to get a Steam release in November</a>, or it might also be Marathon, though it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungies-marathon-reboot-delayed-indefinitely-in-response-to-passionate-fan-feedback">remains indefinitely delayed following a plagiarism controversy</a>.</p>
<p>Either way, this weekend is your last chance to check out Arc Raiders before it comes out in full later this month. If you do hop in or have played it before, pop down below and let us know what you think of it. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/play-online-shooter-arc-raiders-free-next-month-in-final-test-weekend-before-release">The Arc Raiders playtest this weekend</a> is playable on PC via Steam and Epic, Xbox, and PS5. Nothing you collect will carry over to the full game, so just hop in and have a good time.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/this-weirdo-xbox-game-about-a-walking-lighthouse-is-a-keeper.1327903/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>It’s a testament to the developers at Double Fine that it doesn’t take long before controlling a sentient lighthouse with spidery legs starts to feel almost normal. <em>Keeper</em>, the latest from the studio behind <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/12/9/9878278/psychonauts-2-tim-schafer-interview"><em>Psychonauts</em></a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/1/27/7877417/grim-fandango-remastered"><em>Grim Fandango</em></a>, is obviously a strange game. You play as a building that can walk and solve puzzles and which befriends a cute bird while on a quest to rid a fantastical realm of an encroaching darkness. It’s like a cross between the wordless storytelling of <em>Wall-E</em> and the cinematic platforming of <em>Limbo</em>, with a psychedelic splash of Lisa Frank’s paints coating it all. It’s also a game that proves to be much more than it first seems. Somehow, things get even <em>weirder</em>.</p><p>Things start out simple. For unexplained reasons, you, a lighthouse, sprout legs and start stumbling about. There’s not much you can do aside from walk — awkwardly, at that — and point your big spotlight at things. Quickly enough, and after maybe accidentally crushing a few houses as you learn how to move, you’ll meet a big bird who immediately becomes your best friend. All you can do is keep moving forward, and as you do, you’re pulled into a strange world that’s clearly in need of help.</p><p>When you first start out, <em>Keeper</em> plays like a very linear kind of puzzle game. You walk down set paths so you can’t really get lost, and there are simple obstacles in your way. In most cases, you can trigger a magical switch or eliminate a hazardous impediment by shining your light on it. I’m glad the game starts slow because it took some getting used to; unlike most modern games, <em>Keeper</em> has a fixed camera, and you instead use the right stick to rotate the light at the top of the lighthouse.</p><div><p><cite>Image: Double Fine Productions</cite></p></div><p>From there, things slowly but surely open up. Even with only a few actions at your disposal, the puzzles can get surprisingly complex. You’ll be sending off your bird to collect items and flip switches and even messing around with the flow of time. <em>Keeper </em>manages to squeeze a lot out of its limited vocabulary — and then suddenly, it becomes something very different, multiple times. I don’t want to spoil anything because these moments are some of the most enjoyable parts of the game, but eventually, you’ll be able to jump and swim and, I kid you not, by the end the game, it resembles something like <em>Tony Hawk</em>. And along with this, the world similarly expands, giving you more space to explore.</p><p>And really, that world is the heart of <em>Keeper</em>. The puzzles are just there to give you something to do while you take it all in. It’s a strange, colorful, vibrant place, one teeming with life (though there’s not a human in sight). There are giant creatures made out of trees and adorable baby turtles the size of school buses. At one point, you have to find your way out of a clockwork town populated by little robots on wheels; later, you’re traversing caves that pulse with a hideous kind of life. Even though you’re a piece of architecture, <em>Keeper</em> makes you feel a part of this world, like you’re making it better over time. You also make a lot of cute friends who stick around to help when things get tough.</p><p>I put <em>Keeper</em> in the same category as experiences like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/12/13/18137844/gris-review-nintendo-switch-pc-gaming"><em>Gris</em></a> or <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/6/28/12050342/inside-review-xbox-one-steam"><em>Inside</em></a>, where playing them is just a means to an end, and that end is moving through an imaginative, bizarre, and constantly changing space. The clever puzzles and strange forms of movement are just ways for me to feel more a part of the world. By the end of the game, which lasts just long enough to not overstay its welcome, it was almost hard to imagine I ever thought a walking lighthouse was weird at all. <em>Almost</em>.</p><p><sub>Keeper <em>is available October 17th on Xbox and PC.</em></sub></p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTk3"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Andrew Webster</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games/801563/keeper-review-xbox-double-fine]]></content:encoded>

            <p>As I wrote in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dire-comedy-bloodsport-king-of-meat-should-have-been-called-king-of-meme">our King of Meat preview</a>, I've long since fallen out of love with looting games. After thousands of hours rinsing RPG dungeons, I gaze upon even the shiniest and most temptingly crenelated of treasure chests with frigid contempt. But I'm not unenticed by the clanky and colourful, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/deathloop">Deathloop</a> meets <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/tom-clancys-the-division">The Division</a> stylings of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/arc-raiders">Arc Raiders</a>, Embark and Nexon's third-person extraction shooter, which is getting a three day open playtest this weekend.  
</p><!--more-->
<p>As <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/arc-raiders-devs-would-you-like-you-to-slam-its-servers-with-one-last-open-to-all-tech-test-next-month">advertised in September</a>, the playtest is broadly an invitation to stress-test the game's servers before launch on October 30th, but it's not just an exercise in subjecting some weak-ass computers to a vigorous Spartan kicking. "This event will bring you to the Dam Battlegrounds where you'll experience elements of progression and crafting while completing a set of quests to provide you with a little taste of the Arc Raiders experience, while saving some surprises for the full launch," the developers explain.
</p>
<p>You don't need a code to get in, though you will need to create an Embark ID while signing on. Access will "roll out slowly" from today on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1808500/ARC_Raiders/">Steam</a> and the <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/arc-raiders-server-slam-79f964">Epic Games Store</a> (and the consoles, bless 'em). Progress made during the Server Slam won't carry over to the full game, but you do get a special edition backpack for your troubles.</p>

<p>Arc Raiders certainly likes a chunky backpack. Some of the carryalls in the trailers look like half-dismantled pianos. For all that, characters are very nimble, able to zipline between rooftops and descend rapidly to street level without getting squished by all the scrap stuffed into their rucksacks.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Celebrated gaming auteur Hideo Kojima is making waves once again with statements about artificial intelligence. This time, sporting a bit of a new look in a recent interview, Kojima has said he sees AI as a boon that can help cut out what he describes as “tedious” tasks, helping developers to lower costs and produce games faster.</p> <p>In an <a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DPECvLZjFzO/">interview with <i>Wired Japan</i></a> (<a href="https://www.dexerto.com/gaming/hideo-kojima-gives-his-verdict-on-use-of-ai-in-gaming-3269428/">h/t <i>Dexerto</i></a>), Kojima described “a future where [he stays] one step ahead; creating together with AI,” referring to the tech as “a friend.” Kojima presents an optimistic perspective on how the tech can be used, not necessarily to lead the creative projects, but rather to assist with mundane tasks to “boost efficiency.”</p>

 <p>It’s not the first time Kojima has opined on AI in the industry. Previously <a href="https://kotaku.com/hideo-kojima-ai-important-3d-ps6-portable-space-marine-last-of-us-2000621087">he described AI</a> as potentially as significant a development for games as the shift from 2D to 3D. He also recently suggested that AI will likely be used to <a href="https://www.dualshockers.com/hideo-kojima-remakes-sequels-ai/">generate remakes and sequels</a>. Though the most recent statements on the potential friendliness of AI are rather optimistic, Kojima’s own creative output might have something to say about that. AI and advanced technology has often been a focal point of Kojima’s creative works, though they’ve typically played an antagonistic role in his fictional worlds.</p>

 <h2>Kojima’s previous games were far from optimistic about AI</h2> <p>Kojima’s statements are disappointing for those of us concerned about the <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/federal-judge-rules-copyrighted-books-are-fair-use-ai-training-rcna214766">thorny issues of copyright</a> in the context of artificial intelligence systems, the desire to <a href="https://futurism.com/artificial-intelligence/sam-altman-real-work-ai">replace human labor </a>wholesale, and the inexcusable energy consumption that’s literally setting us back in our efforts to <a href="https://news.mit.edu/2025/explained-generative-ai-environmental-impact-0117">lessen the impact of climate change</a>. But they also ring dissonantly with the game developer’s own artistic output, namely <i>Metal Gear Solid 2</i> and <i>4</i>, which speculate not just on the dangers of artificial intelligence, but how the messiness of human history, hierarchies, and internet behavior could use (and lose control of) such highly advanced tech.</p>

  <p>Unravelling <i>MGS2</i> and other <i>MGS</i> games is messy business; like Kojima’s recent works, they’re long, dense games. But the modern embrace of AI, which is already being used to <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/trumps-team-keeps-posting-ai-portraits-of-him-and-we-keep-clicking">efficiently produce propaganda</a> and which <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/jun/30/peter-thiel-palantir-threat-to-americans">folks who do not have humanity’s best interests in mind</a> are strongly encouraging, sounds a hell of a lot like what we were being warned about while the digital Colonel Campbell lost his artificial mind in <i>MGS2</i>.</p> <p>As <a href="https://locusmag.com/feature/cory-doctorow-a-vocabulary-for-speaking-about-the-future/">Cory Doctorow once said</a>, science fiction “is a literature that tells you how to prevent the bad tomorrows.” And while I appreciate Kojima’s optimism, I don’t think just seeing this tech “as a friend” is going to solve the ills of the bad <i>today</i>, much less the bad tomorrow.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-is-getting-a-sequel-1833479366">Nearly six years ago</a>, we learned that 2004’s clunky cult classic<em> RPG Vampire: The Masquerade – Bloodlines</em> was going to get a big ol’ sequel. Now, flash forward to October 2025, and <em>Bloodlines 2</em> is nearly here after <a href="https://kotaku.com/original-writer-on-vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-1844776074">a rocky development cycle</a><a href="https://kotaku.com/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-delayed-past-2021-1846333086"> that saw one studio replaced</a> <a href="https://kotaku.com/vampire-masquerade-bloodlines-2-new-release-date-1850804491">with another and multiple delays</a>. So is the game worth the 20-year wait and all the delays? Well, it depends who you ask.</p> <p>On October 17, three days ahead of <em>Bloodlines 2′</em>s launch on consoles and PC, reviews for the upcoming Chinese Room-developed action adventure RPG went live across multiple outlets. And critics are all over the place with this one. I’ve read a few reviews that make it sound like one of 2025’s worst games, other reviews that call it fine, and even a few that make it clear the reviewer truly enjoyed their time in the digital streets of rain-soaked and vampire-infested Seattle.</p>

  <p>Some critics praised the game’s atmosphere, storytelling, writing, and side characters, while others found a lot of that stuff to be disappointing. Others enjoyed <em>Bloodlines 2’s</em> combat and stealth, while some seem like they would rather eat glass than play anymore. The one thing nearly every review agrees on is that this isn’t really a sequel to <em>Bloodlines</em>. Instead, to many, it’s a linear, action-focused spin-off set in a bland open world with bad side quests and some neat ideas.</p> <p>While some might find such a wide array of critical reviews disappointing or annoying, I love it. These are the kinds of games that can often surprise you, though not always in a good way. Either way, I’m going to try and check out <em>Vampire: The Masquerade – Bloodlines 2</em> when it launches on October 21 on PS5, Xbox, and PC.</p>  <h2><a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/rpg/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-review/">PC Gamer</a></h2> <blockquote><p><em>Bloodlines 2</em> is good, sometimes even great, and it absolutely sated my appetite for a blood-fuelled undead yarn. But it is a sequel in name only, and it never really enthusiastically embraces being an RPG. Given its predecessor’s cult status, and the source material, that’s bound to be a disappointment for some. – Fraser Brown</p></blockquote> <h2><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-review">Eurogamer</a></h2> <blockquote><p>This is an action RPG with barely any character development (or even customisation) in it. You have four abilities you can use, tied to the clan you belong to, and you will unlock all of them within a couple of hours of play. And that’s it – you won’t get any more powerful after that. Powers don’t evolve or change. You can, if you like, unlock powers from other clans, but this won’t increase your overall power or offer more abilities to use in combat. It only offers variation and the potential to mix which four abilities you use, which might lead to finding a new combination you prefer, but it didn’t for me. I ended up using more or less my default abilities for the entirety of the 25-hour game. This, coupled with there being no loot or equipment in the game, makes character development feel thin to the point of nonexistent. – Robert Purchase</p></blockquote> <h2><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-review">IGN</a></h2> <blockquote><p>Where it falls down the most, unfortunately, is as an RPG. You are playing as an elder vampire, so it’s not exactly a typical zero-to-hero story. But just to give a representative example, the damage your melee attacks do at the very beginning is exactly the same as it will be in the final boss fight. You awaken new powers called Disciplines, like being able to turn invisible or smooch an enemy to turn them to your side, but you’ll get all of them for your chosen clan within the first eight hours or so, after which point anything else is mostly a sidegrade. You can upgrade your health track by finding hidden symbols painted in blood across Seattle, but overall there isn’t much of a sense of power progression throughout most of the campaign. -Leana Hafer</p></blockquote> <h2><a href="https://www.dexerto.com/gaming/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-review-3265905/">Dexerto</a></h2> <blockquote><p><em>Bloodlines 2</em> isn’t the typical RPG many were expecting. It tells a great political story, taking you on a grown-up adventure where every choice you make affects the narrative, and it’s wonderfully complex. The city that The Chinese Room has built has a great atmosphere, and it’s populated by lovable (and hateable) characters. However, it could do so much more to live up to its name by taking great elements from the TTRPG to make you really feel like a vampire. As an adventure game, <em>Bloodlines 2</em> shines, but those missing features suck the life out of it as an RPG, for better and for worse. – Jessica Filby</p></blockquote> <h2><a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/rpg/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-review/">Gamesradar</a></h2> <blockquote><p><em>Vampire: The Masquerade – Bloodlines 2</em> is the definition of a crying shame. Clumsy writing and flat, repetitive world design expose a handful of good ideas that never take root, while its poor technical quality and unstable performance will render it unplayable for some. The result is a half-baked, blunt-toothed action-mystery hybrid that disappoints at almost every turn, struggling to leave even the ghost of a good impression. – Jasmine Gould-Wilson</p></blockquote> <h2><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-review-aged-but-still-a-fine-wine/1900-6418425/">GameSpot&nbsp;</a></h2> <blockquote><p>Fortunately, I think the wait (and the absolute&nbsp;chaos of development) was mostly worth it. Though I wouldn’t call <em>Bloodlines 2</em> a great game, per se, I had a great time playing it. For better or worse, it retains a lot of <em>Bloodlines’</em>&nbsp;DNA, blending action, stealth, and mystery to create a mature and enthralling, choice-driven RPG. Though not as nitty-gritty or system-heavy as its predecessor, it still largely feels the same to play. I swear, I experienced deja vu as I crouched through warehouses and nervously spoke with characters seemingly eager to sink their teeth into me if I said the wrong thing to them. However, it&nbsp;<em>also&nbsp;</em>carries with it some jank and technical issues that make it feel like an early aughts title. -Jessica Cogswell</p></blockquote> <h2><a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2/review">PCGamesN</a></h2> <blockquote><p>It seems The Chinese Room has taken all of <em>Bloodlines</em>‘ bad bits – chiefly janky combat and performance woes – and somehow magnified them.<em> Bloodlines 2</em> is neither a satisfying sequel nor a strong enough RPG experience to make the splash that the franchise sorely needs. If you’re a long-time <em>Vampire: The Masquerade</em> fan, you might just find enough to enjoy <em>Bloodlines 2</em>. I myself loved meeting its characters and lurking in the more hand-crafted sections of Seattle. But if you were hoping for a game that comes close to recapturing the magic of Troika’s classic, you won’t find it here. – Lauren Bergin</p></blockquote>

This mode features increased weapon damage, restricted loadouts, a limited HUD, and a far more unforgiving combat environment.

You can level up and master your weapons at your own pace, free from the pressure of competing against other players.</td><td data-align="center">Solo gamers who want to practice and XP farm before entering a long multiplayer session.

<h2 id="h-are-battlefield-6-portal-xp-farms-being-nerfed">Are Battlefield 6 Portal XP Farms Being Nerfed?</h2>



<p><strong>Yes, Battlefield Studios will be adjusting Battlefield 6’s Portal mode to “Diminish the number of XP farms taking up server space while further emphasizing playing with friends on both custom and verified experiences.”</strong></p>



<p>We can’t have nice things, can we? It depends on how you look at it, really. Battlerfield Portal probably wasn’t designed to be an XP grind; it was supposed to be a creative playground filled with fun-filled rides packed with madness. However, the community got smart and used Portal to level up player ranks, weapons, and more much quicker.</p>



<p>Depending on when you read this guide, the nerfs might have already happened. But we know for sure that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-portal-changes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battlefield 6 Portal XP Farms will be patched</a>.</p>

<p>The Horizon Zero Dawn movie aims to start shooting in 2026 and release in 2027. </p>



<p>For those unaware, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sony-files-lawsuit-against-tencent-for-allegedly-copying-the-horizon-series/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sony is fighting Tencent</a> for allegedly copying its Horizon series in its upcoming title, Light of Motiram. Sony recently described the title as a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sony-calls-tencents-defense-in-horizon-clone-lawsuit-nonsense/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">blatant knock-off</a> of their game. Now, new documents have revealed more information, including the release plans for the Horizon Zero Dawn Movie. </p>



<h2 id="h-horizon-zero-dawn-movie-has-a-working-script-and-is-looking-for-a-director">Horizon Zero Dawn Movie Has a Working Script and is Looking for a Director</h2>



<p>According to a report by <a href="https://thegamepost.com/sony-horizon-zero-dawn-movie-filming-release/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The Game Post</a>, the head of PlayStation Productions, Asad Qizilbash, spoke about the release plans for the Horizon Zero Dawn movie in a sworn declaration. Qizilbash stated that a film based on the Horizon series is in development in partnership with Columbia Pictures, with whom they have already partnered on the Uncharted and Gran Turismo films in 2023 and 2023, respectively. </p>



<p>Qizilbash added that they “already have a working script and are actively searching for a director.” The team aims to start “shooting the picture in 2026 and releasing it in 2027.” In the declaration, the PlayStation Productions head also spoke about Aloy’s significance as a brand, not just to the Horizon franchise, but to Sony PlayStation itself. The declaration doesn’t mention anything about the upcoming movie’s cast or plot. </p>



<p>In other news, Tencent had responded to Sony’s copyright and trademark infringement lawsuit with a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tencent-claps-back-at-sony-playstations-horizon-clone-lawsuit/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">motion to dismiss</a>. Additionally, Splash Damage, the studio behind Gears Tactics, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/splash-damage-breaks-tencent-gears-tactics/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">has separated from Tencent</a> with the help of private investors.
