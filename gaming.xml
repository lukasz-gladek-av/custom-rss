            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nexon-q1-2024-finals-underperforms<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nexon has released its financial report for the first quarter of 2024 (since the studio operates on a January to January basis in fiscal year terms), and apparently,&nbsp;<em>The Finals&nbsp;</em>isn't performing as hoped.</p>
<p>In its <a href="https://pdf.irpocket.com/C3659/RLCz/ukdB/n3z8.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank">earnings letter</a>, Nexon reports a drop in revenue of around 13% when compared to the first quarter of last year, as well as a precipitous fall in operating income of around 48%.</p>
<p>The studio puts that deficiency down to "lower consumer spending, rising costs, and an anticipated one-time loss", although it does say that its revenue and income were "stronger than expected".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/ea-sports-fc-mobile-nexon-q1-2024-financials.jpg?itok=LVzPtNou 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/ea-sports-fc-mobile-nexon-q1-2024-financials.jpg?itok=8BBV-aTP 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>EA Sports FC Mobile&nbsp;</em>has been successful for Nexon.</figcaption></figure><p>This performance, Nexon says, is down to the success of&nbsp;<em>EA Sports FC Online</em>, which is available across several Asian markets, as well as&nbsp;<em>EA Sports FC Mobile</em>, a free-to-play version of EA's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ea-sports-fc-24-achieves-145-million-active-accounts-drives-strong-financial-results">wildly successful</a> soccer game.</p>
<p>Nexon also points to the strong performance of gacha RPG&nbsp;<em>Blue Archive</em>&nbsp;as a reason for its financial results exceeding expectations in 2024's first quarter.</p>
<p>Together, these three titles make up for what Nexon calls the "lower-than-expected performance of&nbsp;<em>The Finals</em>". According to Nexon, the game's second season, which <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/finals-season-2">launched in March</a>, temporarily boosted player numbers, but "delivered lower-than-expected retention and revenue".</p>
<p>Despite&nbsp;<em>The Finals</em>' underwhelming performance, Nexon says it still expects the game to help drive a revenue increase on a year-over-year basis in 2024's second quarter, at least in North America and Europe.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-finals-nexon-q1-2024-gun.jpg?itok=qerW-tIy 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-finals-nexon-q1-2024-gun.jpg?itok=6yH2VFkD 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>The Finals&nbsp;</em>hasn't turned out like Nexon hoped in Q1 2024.</figcaption></figure><p>When it comes to Nexon's future, the company says it's releasing major updates for "all of [its] flagship franchises" in the second quarter of 2024, including&nbsp;<em>The Finals&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>EA Sports FC Online</em>.</p>
<p>Additionally, new games like&nbsp;<em>The First Descendant</em>,&nbsp;<em>MapleStory Worlds</em>, and the Chinese release of&nbsp;<em>Dungeon&amp;Fighter Mobile&nbsp;</em>are all scheduled for Q2 or thereabouts, so Nexon will be hoping that those releases can turn its fortunes around.</p>
<p>We'll have to wait and see whether these games represent the sea change Nexon appears to need right now. Stay tuned for more.</p>

			<p>A new Assassin's Creed Valhalla NVIDIA DLSS 3 mod was released online today, bringing massive performance improvements to the latest main entry in the series developed by Ubisoft.</p>
<p>The mod was developed by well-known modder PureDark, who is offering the mod via their <a href="https://www.patreon.com/PureDark" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Patreon page</a>. The video below showcases the modded NVIDIA DLSS 3 Frame Generation and DLSS 2 upscaling implementation, and they both seem to work extremely well, as does Reflex, so the experience won't suffer from any input delay. Additionally, the mod also implements DeepDVC, which is RTX Dynamic Vibrancy, according to the modder, that can be turned on or off at will.</p>
<p><iframe title="Assassin's Creed Valhalla DLSS3 mod and DeepDVC" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6RhH78PMATI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Assassin's Creed Valhalla launched back in late 2020 on PC and consoles and was followed by multiple expansions that introduced new maps and mechanics. Even without the additional content, the game starring Eivor is a solid open-world RPG that does the setting justice for the most part, as I highlighted in my <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/assassins-creed-valhalla-once-sent-from-the-golden-hall/">review.</a></p>
<p><em>Assassin's Creed Valhalla is a definite step up for the series, thanks to the many tweaks made to the RPG mechanics that powered the previous two entries in the series, better storytelling, great atmosphere, and meaningful side-content. Even with the tweaks, however, Assassin's Creed Valhalla is still an Assassin's Creed game at heart, so those who are not into the Ubisoft open-world game design will hardly change their opinion with the game. Everyone else will probably love every second of Eivor's adventure, especially if they are into Vikings and ancient Norse culture.</em></p>
<p>The next entry in the series will be <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-shadows-pricing-and-season-pass-dlc-plan-have-leaked/">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a>. The game set in Feudal Japan will be officially unveiled tomorrow with a new trailer.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24155725/inside-out-2-character-design-same-face-female-characters-disney-princess<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="wcud5I">When director Kelsey Mann took the helm on Pixar’s <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24131409/inside-out-2-preview-first-look-new-emotions-uncut-gems"><em>Inside Out 2</em>,</a> Pixar chief creative officer Pete Docter had one big suggestion for him. Before becoming CCO, Docter directed many of the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/movies/22239548/best-pixar-movies-ranked">studio’s greatest hits</a>, including <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2015/6/5/8733925/inside-out-review">the original<em> Inside Out</em></a><em>.</em> </p>
<p id="9YCa6l">At an early press preview going behind the scenes on <em>Inside Out 2</em>,  Mann told Polygon that the interior world of <em>Inside Out </em>in Riley’s mind was supposed to be more “cartoony” than the realism-grounded outside world. But Mann says Docter told him the final product — 2015’s <em>Inside Out —</em> didn’t quite land the way he wanted. </p>
<p id="AjYlcq">“He said, <em>We thought we were going far with what we could do with the characters inside the mind, in terms of how broadly they moved and were animated</em>,” Mann recounts. “<em>I think we could have gone further. And I kind of regret not dialing that up a little bit. So I highly suggest that you go further.</em> I remember talking to the whole animation department pitching the movie, and saying we wanted to do that. I feel like we’ve done a lot of that on the film — I really tried to push it.”</p>

<p id="6uocju">That’s especially true when it comes to the character design. In the original movie, which centers on an 11-year-old girl and the personifications of emotions in her head, Fear and Anger have distinctly cartoony designs. Their exaggerated shapes are meant to evoke the emotions they represent. But the emotions embodied by female characters don’t capture that same feeling. Joy, Sadness, and Disgust look more generic, and apart from their bright, jewel-toned skin and hair, they could easily pass as human characters in another Disney or Pixar movie. (Joy in particular launched a <a href="https://www.mic.com/articles/113332/the-disturbing-trend-in-almost-every-female-pixar-character-br">significant discussion</a> about the longtime problem of <a href="https://www.cosmopolitan.com/uk/entertainment/news/a34090/disney-women-same-faces/">Disney Princesses all having the same face</a>, and Pixar following the trend, designing all its <a href="https://www.polygon.com/century-of-disney/23655196/disney-princesses-have-the-same-face-elsa-frozen-cinderella-snow-white">female protagonists with round faces and button noses</a>). </p>
<p id="q937Gv">But from the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23953776/inside-out-2-teaser-anxiety-release-date">very first trailer</a>, it was clear that <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24093549/inside-out-2-new-emotions-trailer-ennui-envy-embarassment"><em>Inside Out 2</em>’s new emotions</a> would be different. The new movie introduces Anxiety, a Muppet-like emotion character with a huge, stretchy mouth and big, wobbly eyes. She’s joined by Ennui, who is represented as a lazy, drooping line, and Envy, a tiny mushroom-like blob of an emotion. And there’s also Embarrassment, a huge, hulking figure who hides his big face beneath a hoodie. Already, these four emotions (three of them female) break that round-face, button-nose mold. </p>

<p id="5Fio59">“That was a conscious decision that we made,” says Mann. He cites production designer Jason Deamer as the one who really brought those character-design discrepancies to his attention. “[Deamer said] <em>Why can’t the female characters have the same kind of design sense? It’s pushed, it’s fun.</em> And we leaned into that.”</p>
<p id="e6XtCy">“This is animation, not live-action!” Deamer told Polygon. “So let’s do what animation [can] do — really push the weirdness.”</p>
<p id="raqRnY">After <a href="https://www.polygon.com/22947922/turning-red-pixar-anime-influences"><em>Turning Red</em></a> and<em> </em><a href="https://www.polygon.com/animation-cartoons/22535601/luca-pixar-3d-cg-animation"><em>Luca</em></a>, which both pushed Pixar in a more stylized, cartoony direction, it makes perfect sense that the filmmakers behind <em>Inside Out 2 </em>would feel emboldened to embrace a less conventional look. That’s an <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23033750/the-bad-guys-pierre-perifel-director-interview-dreamworks">industry-wide trend</a> that <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23745774/spider-man-into-the-spider-verse-animation-pixar-netflix-dreamworks">kicked off with<em> Into the Spider-Verse</em></a>, though some studios haven’t been as quick to embrace the movement. But movie by movie, Pixar is slowly welcoming the new. </p>
<p id="3cA8A0">“The studio [is] more open to having different directors with different sensibilities coming into the fore and wanting to pursue a very specific look,” says animation supervisor Dovi Anderson.</p>
<p id="S8MWk6">“Audiences are now more ready for that kind of animation,” adds animation supervisor Evan Bonifacio. “It’s not going to throw them to see stuff moving around in a specific way that feels pushed.”</p>

The latest numbers make it clear that the next-gen hardware will probably never catch up to the sales of the PS4, even as <em>Helldivers 2 </em>crushes all expectations after becoming the fastest-selling Sony-published game in the company’s history.<br></p><div data-video-id="196395" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Week In Games: Co-Op Bug Blasting And More New Releases" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="80" data-playlist="196395,196860,191038" data-current="196395"><div><p>The Week In Games: Co-Op Bug Blasting And More New Releases</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196395/196395_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196395/196395_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196395/196395_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196395/196395_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21945.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><p>The PS5 has now reached 59.2 million lifetime sales, Sony revealed in its <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.sony.com/en/SonyInfo/IR/library/presen/er/pdf/23q4_sonyspeech.pdf&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.sony.com/en/SonyInfo/IR/library/presen/er/pdf/23q4_sonyspeech.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">latest earnings presentation</a></span>. That puts it just shy of the 60 million achieved by the PS4 in a similar time frame, though the company is quick to note that the PS5 hasn’t had the benefit of a $100 price cut like its predecessor did (though Sony has been pushing plenty of discounted PS5 bundles in the last 12 months). The company expects to sell just 18 million more PS5s in the coming year, but also to make PlayStation more profitable near the end of this console generation thanks to cost-cutting and more players playing more games. </p><p> “As we enter the second half of the console cycle, we expect the number of new PS5 units sold to gradually decline,” Sony president Hiroki Totoki told investors. “However, by steadily maintaining and expanding the consistently increasing number of active users and user engagement, while also strengthening control over business costs, we believe that we will be able to steadily increase sales and profits from the PS platform going forward.” </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-kotaku-review-pc-ps5-is-it-good-ps-plus-1851258251&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-kotaku-review-pc-ps5-is-it-good-ps-plus-1851258251"><em>Helldivers 2</em></a></span>, on the other hand, has been a surprise hit. The alien shooter’s already sold over 12 million copies, which Sony says makes it the fastest-selling exclusive in a three-month period in the company’s history, even surpassing 2022's <em>God of War Ragnarök</em>. While that game benefitted from being backwards-compatible, <em>Helldivers 2</em> has clearly benefitted from being day-and-date on PC, even if Sony recently fumbled the bag with <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-do-i-need-psn-steam-account-linking-1851457468&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-do-i-need-psn-steam-account-linking-1851457468">Steam users over a PSN login fiasco</a></span>.</p><p>Sony seems poised to have a quieter upcoming year by comparison. The company confirmed there are still no new big-budget sequels planned to release during that time frame. One of the only big games coming in the immediate future that we know of is Firewalk’s online sci-fi shooter <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/games/concord--1&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/games/concord--1"><em>Concord</em></a></span>, though even that has only been teased with a vague CGI trailer. It seems likely we’ll learn more about it at the next PlayStation Showcase, which is rumored to be scheduled for before the end of May. </p><p>Yesterday, Sony announced that instead of replacing former Sony Interactive Entertainment CEO Jim Ryan, it would promote two of its SVPs, Hermen Hulst and Hideaki Nishino, to lead its game studio and platform business groups, respectively. Both men will report directly to Totoki as Sony seemingly reigns in the division following recent concerns around increasing budgets, longer development times, and acquisitions like <em>Destiny 2 </em>maker Bungie that have turned out to be much messier than previously expected. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/success-cant-save-your-favorite-game-studios-anymore<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">The closure of Tango Gameworks adds a new wrinkle to 2024's game industry troubles.</h2></div><section><p>This week, Microsoft and Bethesda announced that they would be closing down multiple game development studios under their <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-closes-redfall-developer-arkane-austin-hifi-rush-developer-tango-gameworks-and-more-in-devastating-cuts-at-bethesda">umbrella</a>. These include Alpha Dog Games, maker of Mighty Doom, and Arkane Austin, developer of the disastrous <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/redfall-review">Redfall </a>among others. In the gaming industry, the conventional wisdom has long been held that bad games sink you and great games save you, which would lead many to drawing an unfortunate line between Redfall’s reception and Arkane Austin’s closure — but immediately stops supporting that conclusion when you get to Tango Gameworks.</p><p>Founded in 2010 by Shinji Mikami, the studio was largely known for  horror games like Evil Within until last year. As part of a shadow drop release, the cool rhythmic action title Hi-Fi Rush garnered critical acclaim from all sides, multiple awards and nominations, and was recently ported to PlayStation 5. Xbox Vice President Aaron Greenberg even said that the game was a “break out hit” in  “all key measurements and expectations.” Moreover, they did what critics and fans alike beg studios to do: make something wildly different outside of their comfort zones. </p><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-theme="light"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Hi-Fi RUSH was a break out hit for us and our players in all key measurements and expectations. We couldn’t be happier with what the team at Tango Gameworks delivered with this surprise release.</p>— Aaron Greenberg 🙅🏼‍♂️💚U (@aarongreenberg) <a href="https://twitter.com/aarongreenberg/status/1649431572137779203?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">April 21, 2023</a></blockquote> <p>Despite all that, late at night in Tokyo, the people who made a Game of the Year candidate were informed through an email by Xbox Games Studios head Matt Booty that they were closing the studio.</p><p>Hi-Fi Rush was, by Microsoft’s own admission, exactly the kind of game the Redmond giant has been convincing their audience to stick with Game Pass for, which sets unclear goals and expectations from the get-go. What exactly constitutes a success on Game Pass? Hi-Fi Rush topped a whopping 3 million players last year, but that clearly was <a href="https://twitter.com/hifiRush/status/1691846131548913781" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">not enough for the higher ups.</a> The lack of transparency with the general consumer on how games are evaluated internally is understandable, but it seems that not even Tango was aware of what metrics their game seemingly missed.</p><p>Despite having worked at a Japanese game studio myself, it does not take much experience to understand that creative jobs perform better when there is greater incentive beyond decidedly-unclear goals at the end. No one is working on a video game in hopes that they can get to the finish line of release so that they can continue to bite their nails over whether a nearly-90 metacritic game will result in a studio closure down the line as corporate, as Booty puts in the email, “look[s] across the business to identify the opportunities that are best positioned for success.”</p><p>Which leaves us grasping within this self-imposed murkiness for an answer to an important question: If success cannot save your studio, what can?</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>This is a problem that is likely on the mind of every other Xbox studio that does not produce games commanding audiences of tens of millions. With the upcoming release of Hellblade II: Senua’s Sacrifice, it is not difficult to imagine that a successful launch would not shield Ninja Theory from Microsoft’s ever-floating evaluations. Now those talented developers who have spent years toiling away on their game across multiple changes in their parent company’s focus have an ominous pall hanging over their head. It is not just enough to make a good game, nor make a game that critics and audiences both like, but you have to hope that a C-Suite executive’s nebulous plans forward include taking your studio along for the ride.</p><p>We have long assumed that corporate ownership by one of the richest companies in the industry would inoculate studios from tragic closures, but we were wrong. We thought that putting out a game with a modest budget would be protection, but we were wrong there too. And now we have learned that putting out a critically acclaimed title that said richest companies openly brag about succeeding will not protect anyone. There truly is no more shelter to hide under in the gaming industry and developers and consumers both suffer from it.</p><p>When studios are concerned for their very existence, games like Hi-Fi Rush do not have space to make it to market. Tango Gameworks bet on themselves by making something different than what they are known for and, by every metric available to them, that bet demonstrably paid off. In a situation where their head was on the chopping block the entire time, waiting for the executioner to make the call on whether their axe comes down on the back of Tango’s neck, you could not get a Hi-Fi Rush. </p><p>It is also unclear at this point what players can do to support games they love anymore. When the act of championing a game you like can only be measured in numbers too absurd for most video games, then there is no reasonable way to patronize them anymore. If three million players are not enough, why should anyone expect that four or five or ten million would be? It is no longer satisfactory to executives for a game to be a decent success, so there is little reason for audiences to become publicly enamored with what they play. In one fell swoop, Microsoft managed to undermine any grassroots marketing efforts they could have counted on for games that are not Call of Duty.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div><h3>Every Video Game Franchise Xbox Owns After Acquiring Activision Blizzard</h3></div></output><p>The games industry is ill and things like this, like the closure of Tango Gameworks and high-quality studios like Roll7, are symptoms. They can be written off by people as not their kind of game or reasoned with twisted return-on-investment maximization brainworms, but they do not represent an industry that is happy and healthy. The industry is now trying to redefine what success means until it skyrockets into an utterly unattainable goal post. It is likely not by intention, the decision-makers are also flying by the seat of their pants on this high-speed rocket, but ultimately that doesn’t actually mean anything. Microsoft was supposed to be the company that stepped back and said “Not past this line.” Now they’re erasing the line in the sand and hoping we don’t notice.</p></section><div><h3 data-cy="object-summary-embed-title">In This Article</h3></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>There's a good chance that you'll never have the funds to construct a life-sized replica of Metal Gear Rex, the iconic bipedal nuclear weapons platform and boxing ring from Metal Gear Solid. That doesn't mean you can't build a smaller replica, especially when companies like Kotobukiya offer a terrific model. Amazon has grabbed fresh stock of popular import, and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Kotobukiya-Metal-Gear-Solid-Version/dp/B0BTCQBXNJ?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">the $100 price is significantly less than what the Metal Gear Rex kit</a> often sells for (around $141).</p><p><em>You may have to click "Other sellers on Amazon" and choose to buy directly from Amazon to get the $100 deal.</em></p><p>It's worth noting that Amazon rarely carries model kits on its site--these are usually third-party deals, like Bandai Namco's Gundam line--and this is the best price you'll get for Metal Gear Rex. Strangely, at the time of writing this, Amazon's page defaulted to a third-party seller who has this model kit listed for $125, so you'll need to navigate to "Other sellers on Amazon" to find the $100 listing. You'll find this a little ways below the "Buy Now" button on mobile and desktop.</p><h3>Kotobukiya Metal Gear Models</h3><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4302692-metalgearrex%282%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4302692" data-ratio="0.8" data-width="1000" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4302692-metalgearrex%282%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4302692"></a><figcaption>Kotobukiya Metal Gear Rex</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4302692-metalgearrex%282%29.jpg"></figure><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4302685-metalgearrex%283%29.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4302686-metalgearrex%284%29.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4302687-metalgearrex%285%29.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4302688-metalgearrex%286%29.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4302689-metalgearrex%287%29.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4302690-metalgearrex%288%29.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4302691-metalgearrex%2810%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4302685,1300-4302686,1300-4302687,1300-4302688,1300-4302689,1300-4302690,1300-4302691" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4302685-metalgearrex%283%29.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4302686-metalgearrex%284%29.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4302687-metalgearrex%285%29.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4302688-metalgearrex%286%29.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4302689-metalgearrex%287%29.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4302690-metalgearrex%288%29.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1601/16018044/4302691-metalgearrex%2810%29.jpg"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4302685-metalgearrex%283%29.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4302686-metalgearrex%284%29.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4302687-metalgearrex%285%29.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4302688-metalgearrex%286%29.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4302689-metalgearrex%287%29.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4302690-metalgearrex%288%29.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4302691-metalgearrex%2810%29.jpg"></figure><ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Kotobukiya-Metal-Gear-Solid-Version/dp/B0BTCQBXNJ?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Metal Gear Rex (black version)</a> | sold and shipped by Amazon -- $100 ($<del>141</del>)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/KOTOBUKIYA-KP409X-Patriot-Version-Height/dp/B0B8G4TJL1?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Metal Gear Rex (MGS4 semi-damaged version)</a> -- $101</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Metal-Gear-Solid-Plastic-Model/dp/B07ZGQ2F5C?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Metal Gear Rex (MGS4 standard version)</a> -- $130</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/KOTOBUKIYA-Metal-Patriot-KP266X-Height/dp/B0BDYD9DD1?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Metal Gear Ray</a> -- $113</li></ul><p>As for the figure, this is a fun build. Metal Gear Rex has been given a slight modern makeover with new panel lines, as well as a sleek black color scheme to allow for easy painting. You can also add new caution marks and marking decals, and this mighty mecha comes with little figures of Solid Snake, Liquid Snake, Gray Fox when he was still in near-mint condition, and a damaged version of the cyborg ninja to recreate the famous scene where he was crushed by Rex's massive foot.</p><p>If you feel like doubling your order, you can also <a href="https://www.amazon.com/KOTOBUKIYA-KP409X-Patriot-Version-Height/dp/B0B8G4TJL1?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">pick up the "damaged" Metal Gear Solid 4 edition of Metal Gear Rex</a>, which sports a different look.

Tubbz has a fine line of collectible rubber duckie figures, and they are incredibly charming. Solid Snake, Gray Fox, and a young Revolver Ocelot all look fantastic as aquatic espionage agents and the best one is easily a Genome Soldier who comes equipped with a giant exclamation mark over their head.</p><h3>Tubbz Metal Gear Solid rubber duckies</h3><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4302694-tubbz-duck.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4302694" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4302694-tubbz-duck.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4302694"></a><figcaption>This is just too adorable.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4302694-tubbz-duck.jpg"></figure><ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/TUBBZ-Metal-Collectible-Rubber-Figurine/dp/B08GKN1HYD?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Solid Snake</a> -- $16 ($<strike>17</strike>)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/TUBBZ-Metal-Collectible-Rubber-Figurine/dp/B0C37BKZZZ?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Dr. Hal Otacon</a> -- $35</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/TUBBZ-Metal-Collectible-Rubber-Figurine/dp/B0987XY251?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Genome Soldier (boxed edition)</a> -- $20</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/TUBBZ-Metal-Collectible-Rubber-Figurine/dp/B0987ZPR36?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Gray Fox</a> -- $14 ($<strike>17</strike>)</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0C9YMQN7R?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Gray Fox (boxed edition)</a> -- $20</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/TUBBZ-Metal-Collectible-Rubber-Figurine/dp/B08GKMDHYF?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Revolver Ocelot</a> -- $15 ($<strike>17</strike>)</li></ul><p>If you haven't picked up last year's Metal Gear: Master Collection Vol. 1, it's worth noting that you can snag it for Nintendo Switch, PS5, or Xbox Series X for only $30 (was $60).

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/red-dead-redemption-may-finally-be-coming-to-pc/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=red-dead-redemption-may-finally-be-coming-to-pc<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="296" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Last October, the original <em>Red Dead Redemption</em> was <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/red-dead-redemption-port-adds-60-fps-for-ps5/">ported to the PS5</a>. Other than offering the ability to enable 60fps, it wasn’t really much to write home about. What fans <em>actually</em> want is for Rockstar to release the 14-year-old game onto PC. So far nothing, but it could be happening soon.</p> <p data-characters="249" data-current-count="249" data-injectable="false">That’s according to Tez2, a user who, by their own definition, monitors the gaming world, “mostly regarding Rockstar Games titles.” Their latest datamine strongly suggests that <em>Red Dead Redemption</em> could finally be coming to the PC.</p> <figure data-current-count="549" data-injectable="true"></figure>
 <p data-characters="256" data-current-count="256" data-injectable="false">The image uploaded with the Twitter/X post shows some text that simply reads: “Journey across the sprawling expanses of the American West and Mexico in <em>Red Dead Redemption</em>, and its zombie-horror companion, <em>Undead Nightmare</em>, now playable on PC.”</p> <h2 id="h-do-we-need-any-more-hints" data-injectable="false">Do we need any more hints?</h2> <p data-characters="255" data-current-count="511" data-injectable="true">Suffice it to say, what Tez2 has unearthed, which they say was lifted from the Rockstar launcher, pretty much spells it out in black-and-white. Or orange, in this case. If what we see is based on truth, then <em>RDR</em> might actually make it to PC at some point.</p>
 <p data-characters="363" data-current-count="363" data-injectable="false">To ensure I tick the “journalistic due diligence” box (for such a thing exists…I imagine), it needs to be said that this is only speculation at this stage. However convincing the leak is, we can’t make any concrete claims about a PC port until Rockstar or any other official representative of the game can confirm or deny this information.</p> <p data-characters="322" data-current-count="685" data-injectable="false">Even if it does happen, it’s unclear whether it’ll even be a remaster of the 2010 release. There have been upscaled versions of <em>RDR</em> for console in the past, but as the PS5 and Switch releases have shown, chances are it could just be a straight port. We’ll have to wait and see what Rockstar has in store.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-series-sales-100-million-anniversary<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Capcom has announced a major sales milestone for the&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter&nbsp;</em>series as a whole, which feels like a fitting birthday present for the franchise's 20th anniversary.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://www.capcom.co.jp/ir/english/news/html/e240514.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">press release</a>, Capcom reveals that&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter&nbsp;</em>has crossed 100 million sales across the entire franchise, a figure to which entries like&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-world-celebrates-13-million-sales-with-big-bonus-for-players">World</a>&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-rise-13-million-sales">Rise</a></em>, as well as their respective expansions,&nbsp;have significantly contributed.</p>
<p>In fact, a quick glance at Capcom's <a href="https://www.capcom.co.jp/ir/english/business/million.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">"Platinum Titles" list</a>, which celebrates Capcom games that have sold more than a million units, shows that&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter World&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Rise&nbsp;</em>are the two best-selling games in the studio's history.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/monster-hunter-world-series-sales.jpg?itok=jUHFD0XN 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/monster-hunter-world-series-sales.jpg?itok=WJdnFtsf 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Monster Hunter&nbsp;</em>has crossed the 100 million sales mark.</figcaption></figure><p>According to Capcom,&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter World&nbsp;</em>has sold over a million copies each year since the game was released, and sales for the game now stand at more than 25 million units (if the&nbsp;<em>Iceborn Master Edition&nbsp;</em>version is also counted).</p>
<p><em>Monster Hunter Rise</em>, meanwhile, which was released back in 2021, has sold "over approximately 2 million units annually" since its launch, and its expansion&nbsp;<em>Sunbreak</em>, which was released the following year,&nbsp;has done the same.</p>
<p>Capcom says that together with the&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Wilds&nbsp;</em>announcement <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/capcom-teases-monster-hunter-wilds-at-game-awards-2023">made last year</a>, these figures have helped drive the&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter&nbsp;</em>franchise to its 100-million-sale milestone. More&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Wilds&nbsp;</em>info is <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-wilds-summer-capcom">coming in summer</a>, too, so perhaps interest in the series will be renewed once again then.</p>

<p>As well as the regular action-RPG series,&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter&nbsp;</em>has also dabbled in <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-stories-2-announced-for-ps4-monster-hunter-stories-release-date-revealed">turn-based RPGs</a> and&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Go</em>-style <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-now-is-niantics-new-real-world-game-partnership-with-capcom">augmented reality mobile games</a>, among other genres. It's also made the jump to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-movie-arrives-on-blu-ray-march-2021">live-action feature films</a> and anime, as well as crossing over with franchises like the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-x-zoids-collaboration-revealed-with-actual-zoids-inspired-by-rathalos">nostalgia-riffic&nbsp;<em>Zoids</em></a>.</p>
<p>We'll learn more about the future of the&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter&nbsp;</em>franchise in the coming months. For now, though, if you're a&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter&nbsp;</em>fan, you can rest easy in the knowledge that you're far from alone.</p>

			<p>Star Citizen has received one of its most extensive updates yet, <a href="https://wccftech.com/star-citizen-team-introduces-fps-combat-improvements-coming-in-alpha-3-23/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Alpha 3.23</a>, featuring many additions such as NVIDIA DLSS, AMD FSR, and a custom implementation of TSR (Temporal Super Resolution).</p>
<p>The Alpha 3.23 update also brings in a new selection of "first native wildlife" and several improvements and enhancements to the overall game mechanics.</p>
<p><iframe title="Alpha 3.23: Adventure Beckons" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FMgmo8Dfslk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>Meet the Wildlife, Marok and Kopian:&nbsp;</strong>Life finds a way.&nbsp;<strong>Star Citizen’s&nbsp;</strong>first native animals have been added to the game, complete with bespoke behaviors fitting their evolutionary paths. Players will begin seeing the small marok bird soaring through the skies, using its proportionally enormous wingspan to travel vast distances with ease as it follows migratory fish. With the addition of humans to their habitat, they’ve been observed feeding on refuse and leftovers as well. While they present no threat to humans, the same can’t be said for the hound-like kopian. This pest creature is more than a nuisance, and brave citizens will be charged with dealing with wild packs of these hounds, just be sure to bring plenty of ammo.&nbsp;</em></li>
<li><em><strong>Mirai’s Pulse and Pulse LX Hoverbikes Brings Portable Thrills:&nbsp;</strong>It’s about the journey, the thrill. Mirai adds its signature fusion of advanced technology and functional elegance with a pair of hoverbikes that offer an unparalleled connection between rider and machine. The Mirai Pulse pushes the boundaries for what an ‘all round’ hoverbike can be, combining integrated light weapons for defense with an ultra-light frame and extreme performance capable of outrunning almost anything it can’t outgun. Shedding its weapons to improve speed and handling, the Pulse LX is a visual spectacle that brings racing prowess and sophisticated styling. Both hoverbikes are extremely portable, fitting in almost any ship’s cargo bay for terrestrial exploration almost anywhere.</em></li>
<li><em><strong>Master Modes Makes its Galactic Debut:</strong>&nbsp;Flying in the ‘verse will never be the same again. Originally tested in patch 3.20, Master Modes is designed to add further intensity and strategy to ship-to-ship combat and foster exciting dogfighting scenarios. All ships now function in either Navigation Mode (NAV) maintaining a spooled quantum drive for both manual quantum travel and quick-travel to specific locations while disabling most offensive and defensive capabilities, and Standard Control Mode (SCM), with full access to weapons, shields, and devices at the cost of considerable speed. Transitioning between modes takes the flip of a switch and a few seconds for systems to power down and up respectively. All ships have been re-tuned for this significant change to space flight.</em></li>
<li><em><strong>Welcome to the Distribution Center:</strong>&nbsp;Adventure Beckons&nbsp;introduces the first iteration of distribution centers throughout the Stanton system. These massive structures can be accessed from the planetary surface, with underground levels to open in later updates, and serve as mission hubs for law abiding players. Personal ground transportation is recommended for traversing these immense establishments, especially as they expand with additional underground levels.</em></li>
<li><em><strong>Fly, Shoot, and Problem Solve in Arena Commander:&nbsp;</strong>New maps and gameplay opportunities have arrived in&nbsp;<strong>Star Citizen’s</strong>&nbsp;‘game within a game’. Miner’s Lament is a close-quarters dogfighter's dream come true, or worst nightmare, as pilots fight through the asteroid-laden ring around Yela where the rocks are as deadly as other pilots. Going inside, a temporary Experimental Engineering Mode is available for citizens eager to test out the first iteration of engineering gameplay shown off at CitizenCon 2953, and their feedback will help shape the ongoing development of the system.</em></li>
<li><em><strong>Plot a Course with the Star Map:&nbsp;</strong>The Star Map has reached its 1.0 update, rolling out a full 3D view of the system to all pilots. Locations can now be searched by name, with additional functionality to automatically plot a course from the present location. The update marks the introduction of a brand-new FPS map for boots on the ground, aiding players to navigate sprawling landing zones or even the interior layout of their ship. With the Star Map, a citizen is never truly lost.</em></li>
<li><em><strong>FPS Combat Upgrades Deliver More Immersion:&nbsp;</strong>Outside of the safety of a cockpit the ‘verse can be a dangerous place, and&nbsp;Adventure Beckons&nbsp;ensures that fighting and surviving is as engaging and enjoyable on foot as it is from ship to ship. FPS combat has never looked or felt more authentic thanks to a range of visual improvements including improved sprinting animations and a new dynamic crosshair option for a more realistic look of exactly where the muzzle of a weapon is aimed at. The feel of combat has been enhanced for additional immersion, with the inclusion of ‘backpack reloading’ for slower access to additional stored magazines, and procedural recoil for all weapons, ensuring every engagement is a truly unique experience.</em></li>
<li><em><strong>New Cloud Tech and Visual Options:&nbsp;</strong>The volumetric cloud technology in&nbsp;<strong>Star Citizen</strong>&nbsp;has been updated to improve both performance and visual quality, adding ground fog and volumetric shadows as visual options. Additional performance improvements come with support for image upscaling solutions including DLSS, FSR, and an in-house developed TSR solution. Following the addition of over 20 new hairstyles in Alpha 3.22, the character customization system has been overhauled with a new user interface and many new additional customization options.</em></li>
<li><em><strong>Welcoming New Players to all Landing Zones:&nbsp;</strong>The improved New Player Experience, originally released for Area18 in Alpha 3.19, has been expanded and is now supported on all starting locations. While the same core skills are taught at each location, new players can now choose to begin high in the cloud city of Orison, in the mining town of Lorville owned and operated by Hurston Dynamics, on New Babbage which is both a bustling major trading hub and home to high-end electronic companies, or back at Area18’s urban downtown where bright lights attract commerce and entertainment.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>With the Alpha 3.23 dropping in, one can expect a revamped experience, and the addition of exciting in-game content is undoubtedly a delight to witness.</p>

			<p>Microsoft has <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2024/05/14/xbox-game-pass-may-2024-wave-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> the new Xbox Game Pass games coming to the service in the coming weeks.</p>
<p>We <a href="https://wccftech.com/lords-of-the-fallen-and-sniper-ghost-warrior-contracts-2-confirmed-to-be-coming-to-game-pass/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">knew that Lords of the Fallen would be added</a> to Microsoft's subscription service at some point, but as now confirmed, the 2023 title from Hexworks will be added to Game Pass by the end of the month on May 30. In addition, another interesting title that might do well on Game Pass is Ascendant Studios' magic shooter Immortals of Aveum - the game was already added to PlayStation Plus last month, and last year, the<a href="https://wccftech.com/immortals-of-aveum-xbox-game-pass-ps-plus/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> studio's CEO already suggested that the title would be coming to Game Pass as well</a>. "Yes, we are talking to them about getting the game onto both of those services", the CEO said last year. "We don't have a date yet, I'm pretty sure it's gonna happen, though". Immortals of Aveum is being added to the service on May 16.</p>
<p>Other games that will be coming to Game Pass in the coming weeks include Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons (today), Chants of Sennaar (tomorrow), NHL 24 on May 16th, Senua's Saga: Hellblade II (day one on May 21), Galacticare and Hauntii on May 23, Moving Out 2 on May 28, Humanity on May 30, and both Firework and Rolling Hills on June 4.</p>
<p>Games that will be leaving Microsoft's service on May 31 are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Chicory: A Colorful Tale&nbsp;</em>(Cloud, Console, and PC)</li>
<li><em>Farworld Pioneers&nbsp;</em>(Cloud, Console, and PC)</li>
<li><em>JoJo’s Bizarre Adventure: All-Star Battle&nbsp;</em>(Cloud, Console, and PC)</li>
<li><em>Pac-man Museum Plus</em>&nbsp;(Cloud, Console, and PC)</li>
<li><em>Little Witch in the Woods&nbsp;</em>(Cloud, Console, and PC)</li>
<li><em>Railway Empire II&nbsp;</em>(Cloud, Console, and PC)</li>
</ul>

And what about the highly-anticipated sequel to 2017's Hellblade - <a href="https://wccftech.com/senuas-saga-hellblade-ii-comparison-visuals-improved/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hellblade II</a>?

<p id="DDATjj"><em>Chants of Sennaar</em>, the award-winning language puzzle game, lands May 16 but is far from the only major game coming to the service that day.

Every time I so much as see a clip of <em>Street Fighter 6</em>, I’m reminded that Capcom’s hallmark fighting series is so back, and I wish I had the time to stay on that ride for the long run. But I recently got a chance to play Akuma, the classic antagonist who mirrors series mainstays Ryu and Ken’s Shoto archetype, and he made me appreciate how well this entry managed to fill out old characters’ arsenals to create one of the most robust fighting games in the space.<br></p><div data-video-id="191017" data-monetizable="false" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Hopefully Street Fighter 6's New Open-World Won't Mean Capcom Skimps On The Fighting" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="104" data-playlist="191017,192531,194842" data-current="191017"><div><p>Hopefully Street Fighter 6's New Open-World Won't Mean Capcom Skimps On The Fighting</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/191017/191017_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/191017/191017_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/191017/191017_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/191017/191017_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/17131.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><p>As a Shoto character, Akuma has a lot of staple <em>Street Fighter </em>abilities like the Hadoken fireball and Tatsumaki spinning kick (albeit with a handy, anti-air variation) that is the bread and butter of the archetype. But as a Ryu main, playing a different Shoto always feels like getting behind the wheel of a car I’m not used to driving. The fundamentals are the same, but it’s just different enough to throw me off. Akuma’s whole deal is that he gets more options at the expense of health. He’s a glass cannon, but in exchange he gets even more versatility in an already flexible fighting style.</p><p>While playing Akuma, I initially fell into the muscle memory of my hundreds of hours playing Ryu, but those slight variations would send my mind racing to new strategies. His air-based fireball and upward Tatsumaki kept me going high where I would normally have gone low, though I was swiftly punished for this in the right matchups. Facing Cammy was a particular pain point, as she could easily counter my air-based plays.</p><p>Watching <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SIPTOVx6pls&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SIPTOVx6pls" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Capcom’s character breakdown</a></span> for Akuma demonstrates all the little nuances of his moveset I couldn’t pick up in just an hour of play, and that’s the kind of sicko shit that makes fighting games, and <em>Street Fighter 6</em> especially, so rewarding to dive into. Button-mashing through a character you’ve never played can be fun, but mastering a character makes the game so gratifying. <em>SF6</em>’s strength was in how it filled out its roster’s movesets and gave them universal tools like the Drive abilities that handled basic utilities like parrying. This freed up development space for each character’s unique abilities and gimmicks to shine through. Akuma is thriving under that design philosophy, and even if I don’t end up dropping my main for him, I want to learn his every move to best him online.</p><p>How many times can I tell myself “it’s time to go back to <em>Street Fighter 6</em>” before I finally do it? Maybe not too many more, as Akuma is launching as DLC on May 22. </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>According to an interview <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/ex-xcom-creative-director-founds-life-sim-maker-midsummer" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">with GamesIndustry.biz</a>, former XCOM developer Jake Solomon and other industry veterans launched Midsummer Studios to make a life sim.</p>



<p>Soloman is CEO and creative director of Midsummer Studios. They’re also working with Will Miller, another developer who worked at Firaxis. Nelsie Birch will lend their expertise and serve as COO and CFO. </p>



<p>In <a href="https://twitter.com/sbergel/status/1790374766945194130" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a new post</a> on Twitter, Transcend’s Shanti Bergel announced their “lead investment in the oversubscribed $6M Seed round for Midsummer Studios.”</p>



<p>Reports from multiple outlets include further details about Midsummer Studio’s goals and life sim game. Solomon told GamesIndustry.biz that “what we’re really focusing on is the story aspect.” </p>



<p>The CEO showed a lot of interest in letting players make meaningful choices, with rewards and consequences. They mentioned the “drama of modern life and the conflict of modern life.”</p>



<p>Solomon also noted that “I think the danger would be if I was competing with The Sims feature-for-feature.” They say that “we have to do what we do really well; we just have to do it in a new space.” </p>



<p>In a report <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/firaxis-veterans-announce-new-studio-midsummer-studio-to-reinvent-the-life-sim-genre/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">by VGC</a>, Solomon reiterated the modern life approach with meaningful stories, but added that players could “share those stories with the world.” </p>



<p>It will also reportedly be a next-gen title, according to a statement made <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/former-xcom-director-jake-solomon-making-a-next-gen-life-sim" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">via IGN</a>. At this early stage, Midsummer Studios has not confirmed a title or release window for the life sim game.</p>

In doing so, Sony sold more than any fiscal year since the console's launch in November 2020. However, despite that achievement, Sony still fell short of its original PS5 sales target for this year, missing it by more than 4 million units.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Originally targeting 25 million units for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2024, Sony sold 20.8 million, bringing the grand total up to 59 million, despite the 4 million units miss. As noted by&nbsp;<a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/ps5-hits-59m-as-helldivers-2-breaks-playstations-launch-sales-record/"><em>VideoGamesChronicle</em></a>, however, Sony revised that 25 million unit target in February to just 21 million; it still didn't hit that target, though, just narrowly missing the mark.&nbsp;</p>

<p><iframe allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Xq4XNbH6mtk" width="640"></iframe></p>

<p>At 59 million units, the PS5 is just behind the PlayStation 4's 60 million units at the same point in its life cycle. However, Tokyo-based video game analyst Serkan Toto told&nbsp;<em>VGC&nbsp;</em>that 20.8 million units sold is likely going to remain the peak for the PS5, and that this number would have been much lower if not for the release of <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/product/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a> in February, which is <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/news/2024/05/14/helldivers-2-is-playstations-fastest-selling-game-ever-crossing-12-million-copies">PlayStation's fastest-selling game ever after selling 12 million copies in 12 weeks</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>On the earnings call, Sony told investors to expect gaming sales to decrease in the fiscal year that just began (and ends March of next year) due to an expected decrease in console sales. There are also no major games from existing franchises releasing between now and then, according to the company. However, Sony says it still plans to release Concord, <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2023/05/24/introducing-concord-a-new-pvp-multiplayer-fps-from-firewalk-studios-coming-to-ps5-and-pc/">the new multiplayer online shooter IP from Firewalk Studios coming to PS5 and PC</a>, this year.&nbsp;</p>

Midsummer Studios is a team consisting of veteran Firaxis and Maxis designers.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Midsummer was founded by Solomon, who serves as CEO and creative director, game director Will Miller (also formerly of Firaxis), and COO/CFO Nelsie Birch, a newcomer to games with a 25-year career in financial and operations management. They’re joined by executive producer Grant Rodiek, an 18-year veteran of Maxis Studios and former producer/director on several entries of The Sims.&nbsp;In addition to them, the small team currently consists of six other designers.</p>

<p><iframe allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/A5M5i_ygnPo" width="640"></iframe></p>

<p>The company’s debut game will be a next-gen life sim that, according to the press release, “emphasizes player-driven narratives, allowing communities to share memorable moments that grow out of the creativity of players themselves.”&nbsp;</p>

<p>“The best stories in games are written by the players,” said Solomon in the press release. “At Midsummer we’re making a life sim focused on the drama of modern life, where our players will write meaningful stories just by playing, and then share those stories with the world.”</p>

<p>Midsummer has secured a $6 million investment with several partners and is focused on growing a sustainable studio that values the health and happiness of its employees.</p>

<p data-characters="317" data-injectable="true" data-video="true"><em>Fallout</em> has been all over the place, lately. While the Amazon Prime TV show has been a triumph (a <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/fallout-fans-can-relax-as-amazon-confirms-a-second-season-is-on-the-way/">second season</a> was confirmed not long ago), <em>Fallout 4</em> has not been doing so hot. Despite the long wait for the next-gen update, many felt it was severely lacking. But Bethesda seems to want to rectify some of the issues.</p> <p data-characters="240" data-current-count="240" data-injectable="false">The most recent update for the game has now been sent out on all platforms, even previous gen. One of the changes that’s been added is the ability to “manage your control over the game’s graphic fidelity or performance.”</p> <figure data-current-count="540" data-injectable="true"></figure>
 <p data-characters="200" data-current-count="200" data-injectable="false">On top of this, the message above states that Bethesda has also implemented “additional fixes and improvements to address some of the feedback you provided us with on the previous update.”</p> <h2 id="h-will-it-be-enough" data-injectable="false">Will it be enough?</h2> <p data-characters="253" data-current-count="453" data-injectable="true">To go into <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/377160/view/4219387168548816722?l=english" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">more detail</a>, there appears to have been a focus on three areas when it comes to this version of <em>Fallout 4</em>: display settings, frame rate target, and visual and performance prioritization. For instance, you can choose between 30, 40, and 60fps.</p>
 <p data-characters="323" data-current-count="323" data-injectable="false">As always with patches and updates, Bethesda has fixed more than a few bugs. Some examples include: an “issue with load order that would break DLC until a restart after downloading mods” (PS5, specifically) and an issue that could “cause the Creation Club menu to not appear” in the Microsoft store.</p> <p data-characters="276" data-current-count="599" data-injectable="false">Personally, based on what a lot of people have been saying about the next-gen update, I haven’t even bothered to install it on my Xbox copy. Maybe this latest patch will appease some of the bigger concerns, but many didn’t feel the upgrade was worth the long wait.</p>

Introduced on Tuesday, the new Arctis Nova 5 headset is supported by a dedicated companion app that features over 100 game-specific audio presets for Xbox and PlayStation 5 titles like <em>Fortnite</em>, <em>Apex Legends</em>, and <em>Minecraft</em>, which SteelSeries says have been “custom-tailored to each game by audio engineers.”</p><p>Available starting today for $129.99, SteelSeries describes the Arctis Nova 5 as an “affordable luxury.” It’s a smidge pricier than the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/5/16/23725308/steelseries-arctis-nova-4-wireless-headset-price-date">$119.99 Arctis Nova 4 wireless headset</a> launched last year, but for that, you get the ability to change audio presets in real time without leaving a gaming session, as well as cross-platform support for Xbox, PlayStation, Switch, PC, Meta Quest, and phones or tablets that support the included USB-C dongle.</p><div><figcaption><em>Users will need to connect their mobile device to the headset via Bluetooth to utilize the companion app’s audio presets.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: SteelSeries</cite></p></div><p>The Nova 5 companion app requires the headset to be connected to a mobile device via Bluetooth, but that shouldn’t interfere with the ability to receive calls mid-game. The “Quick Switch Wireless” feature swaps audio output between 2.4GHz and Bluetooth 5.3 by tapping a button located on one of the earcups, allowing users to take a call via Bluetooth while their in-game audio retains a passive 2.4GHz connection.</p><div><div><figcaption><em>The design isn’t far removed from that of previous Arctis headsets. Note how the microphone slots into the earcup when fully retracted.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: SteelSeries</cite></p></div><div><figcaption><em>And here’s a better look at the Quick Switch Wireless button, seen here on the right earcup.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: SteelSeries</cite></p></div></div><p>SteelSeries says the Arctis Nova 5 can last up to 60 hours per charge and that the headset’s USB-C fast charging can provide six hours of play on a 15-minute charge. It’s powered by neodymium magnetic drivers (which are fairly common in modern headsets), while a new high-bandwidth microphone chipset provides support for 32kHz / 16-bit audio to help keep in-game communications clear.&nbsp;</p><p>The microphone itself retracts into the headset when not in use, blending pretty seamlessly into the earcup. The Nova 5 also supports the same AI noise cancellation feature seen on the Nova 4 to help further reduce background noise in loud environments. Considering the Nova 5 is only an additional $10, the extra perks it provides could sway SteelSeries customers to dig around their couches for loose change to fund the upgrade.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24153893/lord-rings-power-season-2-trailer-release-date-sauron<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="nSQa6n">If Amazon Studios’ teaser trailer for the second season of <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23329258/lord-rings-power-review-episode-release"><em>The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power</em></a> has one thing to say, it’s that <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23342914/lord-rings-power-sauron-halbrand">Sauron is back</a> and it’s everybody’s problem. </p>
<p id="FdiZjC">The teaser checks in with most of our characters from season 1 — Elrond, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23327568/galadriel-the-rings-of-power-actor-lord-of-the-rings">Galadriel</a>, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23330685/rings-of-power-dwarves-rock-lord-lotr-moria">Prince Durin</a>, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23331596/lord-rings-power-arondir-bronwyn-elf-human-romance">Arondir</a>, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23378700/lord-rings-power-adar-tolkien-galadriel-episode-6">Adar</a>, and even <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23403120/rings-power-who-is-stranger-wizard-actor-daniel-weyman">the Stranger</a>. In true “teaser” fashion, it’s light on specific plot details, but a cascade of gold rings — perhaps nine? — and a conspicuously bejeweled ring in the hands of King Durin give a hint at the season’s arc. </p>
<p id="wmDKEy"><em>Rings of Power</em>’s first had a lot of scene setting to do, as Sauron wormed his way into the confidence of elven leadership and put his mitts all over the forging of their three rings of power. Season 2 seems to continue with the two other sets of rings — the seven for the dwarves “in their halls of stone,” and “nine for mortal men doomed to die.” </p>
<p id="xzt3wx">Also: There’s a big eagle! He better talk like the ones in the books because I will not stand for another wave of “<a href="https://www.polygon.com/lord-of-the-rings/22432394/eagles-lotr-plot-hole-mordor">Why didn’t they just ride eagles to Mordor?</a>” I’ve put in my time! </p>
<p id="zOiM43"><em>The Lord of the Rings: The Rings of Power</em> will return on Aug. 29, on Amazon Prime Video. </p>

<p>When you hear the word iRacing, you probably think of sim racing and hyper-realism. What doesn’t likely come to mind are words like space, arcade, and off-road. But did you know that iRacing and in-house studio Orontes are developing a racing game with those three words in mind?</p>



<p>Meet ExoCross, <a href="https://www.iracing.com/orontes-games/exocross-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">an off-road racing game</a> set roughly 100 years into the future where all forms of fossils fuels and vehicles have been banned on earth. Now, racers are controlling vehicles on other planets in deep space from the comfort of their own home. </p>



<p>Insider Gaming recently sat down with ExoCross creative director Paul Coleman to talk about the game’s development over the years, what players can expect to experience, what will keep them coming back to the game, and so much more.</p>



<p>The written interview is below, but, if you prefer, you can watch or listen to the conversation as well. ExoCross is scheduled to launch this summer on PC, Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, and PlayStation 4.</p>

<h2 id="h-exocross-interview-with-paul-coleman">ExoCross Interview With Paul Coleman</h2>



<h3 id="h-for-those-that-may-not-know-what-exactly-is-exocross">For those that may not know, what exactly is ExoCross?</h3>



<p><strong>Coleman: </strong>“Yeah, so ExoCross is an off-road racing game set in the future; about 100 years into the future.&nbsp;The premise is that the earth was getting too polluted.&nbsp;&nbsp;Cars, all forms of fossil fuels and transportation devices got banned. People stopped racing cars for real, but they turned to sim racing as a way of essentially scratching that itch and getting out and competing with one another.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“So, sim racing lasted for a good 100 years, but people started to get bored of it because ultimately a new generation were coming through that hadn’t actually driven real cars.&nbsp;(2:04)&nbsp;They didn’t really know what they were simulating.</p>



<p>“So the premise with ExoCross is that to reinvigorate sim racing, we’ve explored deep space.&nbsp;&nbsp;We’ve looked for planets that are similar to earth in terms of gravity and flora and fauna.&nbsp;And we’ve looked for places to take our fossil fuels and essentially tear up other people’s planets instead. You’re racing remotely from earth, from your habitation pod in earth.&nbsp;&nbsp;You are one of the drivers in the ExoCross championships.&nbsp;&nbsp;And you’re racing these off-road vehicles via communication technology out into deep space.&nbsp;And you’re doing it from the comfort of your own home. </p>



<p>“It’s our kind of tongue-in-cheek take on where sim racing could go at some point in the future.&nbsp;But we’ve seen it as an opportunity to weave in a story around why people aren’t racing real cars anymore.&nbsp;But yeah, ExoCross at its core is a fun off-road racing game that’s set out in the distant future on planets that aren’t earth.”</p>



<h3 id="h-what-made-orontes-and-drag-outer-zones-appealing-to-the-iracing-team-as-something-that-should-be-worked-on-after-purchasing-the-studio">What made Orontes and Drag: Outer Zones appealing to the iRacing team as something that should be worked on after purchasing the studio?</h3>



<p><strong>Coleman: “</strong>I think the first thing that came across about Orontes as a studio was the fact that it was two brothers extremely passionate about the stuff that they do.&nbsp;Super, super talented, like an amazing engineer and a brilliant artist, and they were just working together to make this incredible game as a pair. And the way they made this incredible racing game&nbsp;was to build an awesome engine,&nbsp;and the Orentis engine is essentially built out of&nbsp;their hard work, their blood, sweat and tears,&nbsp;but they’ve built it in such an incredibly forward-thinking&nbsp;and future-proof way that I think the main thing&nbsp;that the guys at iRacing saw when they approached them&nbsp;was just the opportunity&nbsp;and the sheer kind of passion&nbsp;that had been poured into that engine.</p>



<p>“But also the fact that it was so well put together and it could run at an amazing frame rate, look great, it offers huge potential, and it’s not just purchasing drag as a title and that being the end of it, which is what happens so many times when studios are bought up.&nbsp;This is actually about investing in the technology and using that as a foundation to then build a whole series of games on that tech going forwards.”</p>



<figure></figure>



<h3 id="h-how-was-blending-what-was-already-built-for-the-game-by-orontes-and-what-iracing-has-to-offer">How was blending what was already built for the game by Orontes and what iRacing has to offer?</h3>



<p><strong>Coleman:</strong>&nbsp;“I think it’s one of the biggest challenges when you kind of parachute into a project is to kind of have a sit-rep, understand where the strengths are, where the weaknesses are, what the scope of the project is and what the company actually wants to get from it.&nbsp;And then you start bringing together the needs of the business, obviously the desires of the community and the players and what already exists to try and bring that together into a coherent package that really still surprises and delights the audience that are going to play it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The beauty of the engine is that so much of it was working well already, so it already had that running for it. But there were areas that we definitely wanted to play with and improve.&nbsp;iRacing as a company, anything that comes with the iRacing logo on it has to stand for great on-track action, wherever that is, whether it’s Dirt Track Racing, whether it’s NASCAR, whether it’s the simulation that the core product represents or whether it’s ExoCross, which we’re making, it has to be an excellent on-track experience and it has to represent awesome vehicles driving around tracks.&nbsp;So that was the key thing that we wanted to maintain but actually improve upon.</p>



<p>“So there are key areas with ExoCross that we have played with and we’ve improved.&nbsp;The way the vehicles drive, the tyre model, all of these things are things where we’ve brought in experts from iRacing to help with that.&nbsp;As we move towards making it a console product, one of the key areas that we’ve added is AI-based racing. So AI are coming in and they’re giving you competition to race against without you having to head online to have wheel-to-wheel action.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“The AI system has basically, we’ve brought over from iRacing where we know that iRacing has one of the greatest AI systems in the whole racing genre.&nbsp;So why not bring it in and use it and build on that strength? But then there’s also stuff that we’re doing within ExoCross that will hopefully then feed back into iRacing as a bigger product and hopefully improving those areas.”</p>



<figure></figure>



<h3 id="h-was-there-anything-with-drag-now-exocross-that-you-felt-needed-to-be-changed-removed-or-just-didn-t-fit-in-the-new-vision-for-the-game">Was there anything with Drag, now ExoCross, that you felt needed to be changed, removed, or just didn’t fit in the new vision for the game?</h3>



<p>Coleman: “I&nbsp;think the key thing was how it was packaged and whether that would work for a console audience.&nbsp;I think as an early access product, it showed the promise.&nbsp;It definitely gave enough challenge for players to keep coming back, keep racing. </p>



<p>“There was some good online there where players could group up and meet up and play together, but it didn’t feel like a coherent package.&nbsp;It felt like something that was still in development.&nbsp;And that is ultimately what early access is. You sign up for a product in the hope that it’s going to grow and it’s going to develop and it’s going to become more than it currently is at the point at which you buy into it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Their roadmap looked good, but iRacing, I think, was one of the key missing features that was the must-have that we put on the table and said, whatever happens, we’re going to improve AI or introduce and then improve AI.&nbsp;Obviously, there’s the content-based stuff as well, like looking at the two cars that they had, they were OK. But we wanted to add another vehicle in there so that we could almost get this easy, medium and hard flavor to the game and ensure that players had more sense of progression as they move through the tiers.&nbsp;And then beyond that, making sure that there was a more broader variety of racetracks to go race on, championships to progress through.&nbsp;So ways to just essentially keep the players playing and give lots of different types of players lots of different ways to play.”</p>

<h3 id="h-what-would-you-say-is-something-that-will-keep-players-coming-back-race-after-race">What would you say is something that will keep players coming back race after race?</h3>



<p><strong>Coleman:</strong> “I&nbsp;think for me, it’s a challenge.&nbsp;I think we’re not setting out to make a game that’s impossible to beat, but we do want a game that has a nice, gentle, early difficulty curve that then ramps up.&nbsp; So there’s quite a high skill ceiling. And I think that’s reflected in some of the leaderboard challenges and the ways that we’re encouraging players to play.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“So really, the single player is an onboarding into the wider experience.&nbsp;And then going online to play with other players, going into challenges and special events to compete on the leaderboards. That’s where we see there being more longevity and more reasons to keep coming back.&nbsp;I think it’s one of the beauty of off-road racing is that it’s much harder to get a perfect lap because there’s so many more variables.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Loose surface driving; how you set the car up for a corner. There’s just so much more than just picking a perfect line and nailing your braking and your throttle points that makes it off-road that much more hard to master.&nbsp;So yeah, we are all about making a game that is going to feel fun to pick up and play early on, but it’s going to have that sort of real mastery level to it where you feel like every time you drive a stage, you can do that a little bit better.”</p>



<h3 id="h-how-is-the-studio-finding-the-balance-between-controller-and-wheel-drivers">How is the studio finding the balance between controller and wheel drivers?</h3>



<p><strong>Coleman:</strong> “I think probably the best way to answer that is to describe how we’ve developed it.&nbsp;So I think when you make a game that’s more focused on the realism and the simulation, you tend to do all of the gameplay balancing and refinement on a wheel and then you think about how it’s going to feel on the pads later.&nbsp;I think when you’re making a game that’s more console focused, you do a lot of the refinement and balancing with a controller in your hands and then you check the wheel later on and make sure that that’s also working well.</p>



<p>“So both ways work and both ways generally end up with the game feeling good in both scenarios.&nbsp;But by doing pad first, you are capturing what the majority of console players will be experiencing and then checking that against how the wheel feels and ensuring that the wheel does still feel fun.&nbsp;But, you know, the wheel, I would describe wheel play in this as more intensive in that you have to be more off road with your inputs, so really throw the car in. </p>



<p>“So where I think on a track racing game, you would be more gentle with your inputs.&nbsp;You’re trying to do minimal steering really with the wheel and let your feet do the steering with the rotation of the car.&nbsp;With off road, you want to kind of do similar, but you sometimes need to make that first input a bit more abrupt to just get the car to bite. And then it’s about catching the slide and maintaining the slide with delicate steering input.&nbsp;And I think we’ve got that with the wheel right now.&nbsp;So I think it’ll be fun on both. That’s that’s our goal.&nbsp;That’s what we’re setting out to do.&nbsp;But I want console players to know that it feels great on a pad and they don’t have to go out and buy a wheel to get the most out of this.”</p>



<figure></figure>



<h3 id="h-exocross-won-t-be-cross-platform-do-you-think-there-s-a-risk-of-potentially-alienating-players-or-limiting-that-player-base-to-play-online">ExoCross won’t be cross-platform. Do you think there’s a risk of potentially alienating players or limiting that player base to play online?</h3>



<p><strong>Coleman: </strong>“Yeah, I think there’s always that risk.&nbsp;And my hope is that we do get big enough communities on each platform for us not to have a community of players feeling isolated across these different platforms and not finding a way to play together.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“My hope is that each platform stands strong and the players within those platforms can enjoy themselves. There are certain challenges with cross-platform play that require a fairly significant investment in development to ensure that they work well.&nbsp;And actually, the easy part is getting platforms playing together on a server.&nbsp;The more challenging aspect comes from dealing with some of the certification requirements and making sure that Microsoft and Sony are happy with the way that their platform is being represented on the other platforms and how their players are being protected across the other platforms. </p>



<p>That’s where a lot of the development work and challenge comes in.&nbsp;So, yeah, it’s something that I think, in terms of wish lists, I’m with you and I’m with the community.&nbsp;It’s something that we should absolutely be trying to do with every game we make. But I think for ExoCross, we’re going to try with cross-generation and see how we go with that and then potentially expand into cross-platform if the need arises further down the line.”</p>

Hi-Fi Rush received almost universal acclaim – it was wholly unique, polished, and tightly paced. It was also like nothing developer Tango Gameworks had ever made before, and <a href="https://www.inverse.com/gaming/hi-fi-rush-surprise-release-xbox" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>seemingly made explicitly for Xbox Game Pass</u></a>. It followed closely in the footsteps of games like Psychonauts 2 and Pentiment, neither of which match the profile of the big, blockbuster AAAs that move millions upon millions of copies, and yet they were beloved anyway. Taken as a whole, they lent credibility and prestige to Xbox Game Pass as an accessible library of well-supported, beautifully crafted art.</p><p>Now, just over a year later, Xbox has decreed the award-winning studio behind Hi-Fi Rush no longer necessary to its business. Its work does not consist of “high-impact titles” that Xbox is prioritizing. It is not among “the opportunities best-positioned for success,” as Xbox Game Studios head Matt Booty put it. Tango, along with Arkane Austin, Alpha Dog Studios, and hundreds of workers are being cast aside.</p><p>We’ve written about the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ive-never-seen-it-this-bad-game-developers-explain-the-huge-layoffs-hitting-riot-epic-and-more"><u>devastating impact such mass layoffs </u></a><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/game-developers-mass-layoffs-human-impact-sony-ea"><u>continue to have</u></a> on individuals within the games industry. We’ve also <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/phil-spencer-and-the-battle-for-xboxs-soul"><u>discussed some of the internal strife</u></a> over Xbox’s identity. Now, brand new questions have emerged following Xbox’s latest shutdowns, few of them more pressing than what the future holds for Xbox Game Pass after the demise of one of its star developers.</p><h2>Xbox Growth Pass</h2><p>Xbox Game Pass has always been intrinsically tied to Xbox CEO Phil Spencer. Upon taking over Xbox from his predecessor Don Mattrick, one of Spencer’s earliest moves was to bring the brand back to a pure gaming focus after an unpopular pivot to entertainment. But he didn’t stop there. After a 2014 acquisition of Minecraft developer Mojang saw wild success, Spencer saw a pathway to <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/microsofts-videogame-boss-and-the-long-battle-to-reinvent-the-company-11643912561#selection-3903.9-3903.79" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>linking his gaming growth ambitions with that of Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella’s broader plans for cloud technology</u></a>.</p><p>In 2017, the public <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2017/02/28/microsoft-announces-xbox-games-pass-subscription-service"><u>saw those plans begin to unfold</u></a> with the debut of Xbox Game Pass. At the time of its announcement, Game Pass was a huge deal: a monthly subscription service a la PS Now, but with direct game downloads rather than streaming and over 100 games at launch, including first-party games.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>A gaming subscription service was always a risky business move. </p></div><p>But exciting as that was for consumers, a gaming subscription service was always a risky business move. Similar services have come and gone over years, with even the best (Nvidia GeForce Now) falling short of massive popular success and some (Google Stadia) <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/stadias-shutdown-the-history-of-googles-doomed-project-from-those-inside-and-out"><u>becoming cautionary tales</u></a>. Netflix served as a proof of concept for such a service, but <a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/microsofts-videogame-boss-and-the-long-battle-to-reinvent-the-company-11643912561#selection-3903.9-3903.79" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>reports suggest</u></a> that a number of Microsoft leaders told Spencer the service was a bad idea when he pitched it. At the time, Spencer was floating Rare’s upcoming Sea of Thieves as the ideal Game Pass game. But <a href="https://www.gq-magazine.co.uk/culture/article/xbox-phil-spencer-todd-howard-interview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Rare boss Craig Duncan asked Spencer</u></a>, “If every single person plays Sea Of Thieves on Game Pass, and we don’t sell a single copy. Are you kind of cool with that?” Spencer was.</p><p>When Game Pass debuted in 2017, it was more than a launch of a subscription service – it was the launch of an entire, multi-year strategy. Xbox started firing on all cylinders. It bought Ninja Theory, Undead Labs, inXile, Obsidian Entertainment, and Double Fine Productions. It spun up The Initiative and World’s Edge. It made the biggest-ever acquisition in gaming history when it bought Zenimax, bringing with it Bethesda, id Software, Arkane, Tango Gameworks, Machine Games, and Zenimax Online. Then Xbox broke that record again by purchasing Activision Blizzard. </p><p>In the process, Game Pass expanded. In 2018, Xbox began releasing first-party games on day one on the service. It added PC Game Pass in 2019 and implemented cloud gaming on mobile in 2020. Rumors swirled of Xbox trying to get Game Pass on Nintendo Switch, among other platforms, and of future Smart TV integration as well. </p><p>Through it all, Spencer made it clear that Game Pass was the centerpiece of Xbox’s strategy. It tied all the pieces together: console, mobile, PC, the acquired studios, outreach into new markets, cloud gaming, and <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2018/12/06/phil-spencer-wants-xbox-game-pass-to-cross-over-with-project-xcloud"><u>Spencer’s dream of reaching 2 billion gamers</u></a> wherever they happened to play. So what the heck is happening now?</p><h2>The Horizon Three Bet</h2><p>For all the praise Game Pass receives from consumers, it’s become apparent in recent years that the service has struggled to meet its creators’ lofty expectations. On one hand, it’s been consistently praised as a <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-game-pass-is-having-its-best-stretch-ever"><u>great deal for consumers</u></a>, and plenty of developers have praised it as well. The service has been <a href="https://www.pcgamesinsider.biz/news/71723/heres-how-xbox-game-pass-developers-are-compensated/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>a boon for indies</u></a>, too, who have used its guaranteed funding to get their games over the finish line. At its best, Game Pass is great for Xbox’s internal creatives, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/obsidian-xbox-acquisition-strategy-staying-out-way"><u>many of whom have spoken glowingly</u></a> about Xbox and Game Pass serving as a home for the kind of creatively interesting yet less marketable games that other parent companies or investors wouldn’t otherwise back.</p><p>But glowing reviews from some partners and consumers don’t necessarily mean the idea makes business sense for everyone. Larger third-party developers, for instance, have complained that Game Pass cannibalizes retail sales -- concerns that Microsoft <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/microsoft-confirms-game-pass-cannibalizes-sales" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>admitted last year were founded</u></a>. Major third-party publishers including <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-xbox-call-of-duty-xbox"><u>Activision Blizzard CEO Bobby Kotick</u></a> and <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-game-pass-not-value-destructive-like-playstation-claims-football-manager-boss-says"><u>Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick</u></a> have publicly stated they think the business model is a bad idea and aren’t interested in participating (though an acquisition solved the former disagreement). For Xbox, every single Game Pass game is a gamble that only pays off if enough people subscribe as a result.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>“Microsoft initially wrote a bunch of big checks, which inflated the valuation of smaller and medium-sized game makers,” Joost van Dreunen, NYU Stern professor and <a href="https://superjoost.net/about" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>independent analyst</u></a> told me. “But unlike a premium model, in which a studio gets a piece for every unit sold, selling your game to a subscription service means you only get paid once. The upsell to developers has been that their participation would provide greater visibility and the opportunity to sell digital items on the back-end. However, as Netflix and Spotify will tell you, it is the blockbuster hits that carry the subscription and account for the bulk of playtime. The dystopian point of view here is that content creators are reduced to a cost-plus line item in a subscription-model that only values them for the increase in subscriber count they provide.”</p><p>For a while, this was a problem Xbox could afford to ignore. Microsoft’s pockets were deep, it clearly didn’t mind pouring money into the ambitious <a href="https://www.gq-magazine.co.uk/culture/article/xbox-phil-spencer-todd-howard-interview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>“Horizon 3” bet that was Game Pass</u></a>, and Xbox’s expenditures were just a blip on Microsoft’s balance sheet anyway. But with the $69 billion acquisition of Activision-Blizzard – not to mention all the legal and government hullabaloo that came with it – we’ve started to see signs that Microsoft’s critical eye is now focused on its gaming division. </p><p>This new scrutiny comes at an awkward time for Xbox. Game Pass, the prize strategy that was supposed to tie everything together, is almost certainly not meeting internal expectations. Earlier this year, we got a rare numbers update: 34 million paid subscribers, up from 25 million in 2022. But that number alone doesn’t tell the entire story. The previous subscription total was <em>just</em> for Xbox Game Pass, but the update comes after Game Pass was merged with Xbox Live Gold to form Xbox Game Pass Core. So yes, Game Pass membership shot up, but that boost required Xbox to mandate the service in order to play games online at all. It’s unlikely the service is seeing nine million user boosts on the regular, especially with Spencer admitting that <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/phil-spencer-xbox-game-pass-profitable-price-increases"><u>growth is slowing down</u></a>.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Game Pass was pitched as a game changer...but mounting evidence says it is far from completing its mission.</p></div><p>What’s more, Game Pass was pitched as a game changer – a way for Microsoft to lead gaming in a new direction. But mounting evidence says it is far from completing its mission. Circana senior analyst Mat Piscatella notes in his assessment (which is focused on the United States), “subscription is not showing signs that it is becoming 'the future of gaming.'” Premium games and free-to-play are still the dominant method of gaming, and subscription spending in the US has shown “flat to low single-digit growth since mid-2021.” Cloud gaming, pitched as the logical next frontier for such a service, has similarly failed to achieve widespread adoption. </p><p>George Jijiashvili, senior analyst at Omdia sees the struggles of Game Pass as symptoms of larger problems at Xbox, among them declining hardware sales during what should have been a growth phase for the console. While Xbox Series X and S hardware sales dropped 19% year-over-year in 2023 by Omdia’s estimate, PlayStation sales grew by 56%, and the seven-year-old Switch outsold Xbox by a factor of two. Meanwhile, Game Pass itself is set to fall short of reaching even half of its goal of 100 million Game Pass subscribers by 2023. For these reasons, Jijiashvili suspects “a drastic change in strategy” is required for Xbox to course correct, one which he suspects must include a focus on PC and mobile, especially cloud gaming.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div><h3>Every Video Game Franchise Xbox Owns After Acquiring Activision Blizzard</h3></div></output><p>This crossroads for Xbox comes at a difficult time for the games industry as a whole, too. As Piscatella explains to me, one of the biggest challenges for any video game company now is the impact of games like Fortnite, Minecraft, Roblox, Grand Theft Auto, Call of Duty, and similar games that pull the vast majority of player time and spend all on their own. The pandemic saw video games shift “from a growth market to a mature market,” he says, with both engagement and spending effectively hitting caps. If companies want to see growth, they have to pull players away from those games – a tall order indeed.</p><p>“If we know the ceilings, and we know more about where, why and how people are playing (and really the ways they want to play, since we have all that data from 2020-21 when there were very few competitive activities to gaming), then it's tougher to make big bets on huge shifts in that behavior. I'm speculating a bit here,” Piscatella says.”But when I look at what's happening, I see a strategic shift not so much because one strategy failed, but because of a realization that chasing one particular strategy may not be optimal or deliver the desired results.”</p><h2>A brand at the X-roads</h2><p>Today, Xbox finds itself at an impasse. It has to start returning Microsoft’s investment, and soon. It can’t back out of its lofty promises for first-party games on Game Pass without risking consumer fury, especially amid hardware declines. That means relying on something other than Game Pass to rake in the cash. <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-is-launching-its-mobile-game-store-rivaling-apple-and-google-in-july"><u>Sarah Bond mentioned an upcoming mobile storefront</u></a> that would capitalize on the power of recently acquired Candy Crush. Analysts I spoke to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/how-xbox-is-changing-the-nature-of-exclusivity"><u>have been predicting this would happen in 2024 for months now</u></a>, but it’s still unclear whether or not such a marketplace will need Game Pass attached to succeed or, if so, what that even looks like.</p><p>Mobile is powerful, but it’s not enough to transform Xbox’s business strategy, especially given its extreme lateness to the market. On top of the mobile storefront, Xbox’s new strategy will almost certainly include the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sea-of-thieves-coming-to-playstation-5-in-april-as-xbox-confirms-the-four-exclusives-headed-to-other-platforms"><u>reassessment of platform exclusivity</u></a> for even more games -- something Jijiashvili says is long overdue. Jijiashvili also expects Xbox to work on expanding its PC market via PC Game Pass, especially now that Activision Blizzard’s portfolio is in play. Van Dreunen suggests Xbox might add new tiers to Game Pass – perhaps one tailored for mobile, or an ad-based version.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The idea of shutting down such storied, acclaimed studios would have seemed absurd until recently.</p></div><p>But none of that necessitates a robust portfolio of creative, unique, smaller games - like Hi-Fi Rush - that previously seemed tailor-made for Spencer’s vision of Game Pass. <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-exec-reportedly-told-staff-we-need-smaller-games-that-give-us-prestige-and-awards-a-day-after-shutting-down-hi-fi-rush-dev-tango-gameworks"><u>Even if Xbox Game Studios head Matt Booty insists otherwise</u></a>. Xbox has promised, for now, that Hi-Fi Rush and Redfall will remain available, but for how long? Already, Redfall’s <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-abandons-redfall-and-cancels-dlc-after-shutting-developer-arkane-austin-down"><u>promised updates and planned DLC have been binned</u></a>, and in an age of digital ownership there are no guarantees that either game will remain available forever.</p><p>Even more importantly though: what happens to the studios that were making them? There’s been plenty of nervous speculation online already about the possibility of Xbox shutting down studios like Ninja Theory or Obsidian once their upcoming projects – Hellblade 2 and Avowed – are out the door. The idea of shutting down such storied, acclaimed studios would have seemed absurd until recently, but the games industry and Xbox in particular have reached a point where nothing seems off the table if an executive believes cuts will help a bottom line somewhere.</p><p>It’s not the only possibility, though. A more likely, if not exactly happy, possibility is that Xbox starts taking on a more hands-on role with its owned studios, similar to its competitors. Previously, Xbox has been praised for a hands-off approach that allowed studios like Obsidian to make games like Pentiment, though the flipside is that <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xboxs-perfect-dark-reboot-is-still-years-away"><u>studios like The Initiative have apparently floundered without strong creative direction</u></a>. Xbox could start directing its studios to make games and IPs that it expects will be more than just critical darlings to sell Game Pass.</p><p>For years, Xbox bet that if it had enough incredible games in one place, it could fundamentally change the calculus of how players chose to play. It lost that bet, but it did create an excellent service in the process. Now Xbox appears to be doubling down on that bet, but not in the way we might like it to. It appears to be prepared to give up the incredible, risky, boutique projects that made Game Pass so wonderful in exchange for Call of Duty, Candy Crush, and a PC/mobile-first strategy. Great games, it seems, are no longer enough.</p><p>When I asked Simon Carless of <a href="https://newsletter.gamediscover.co/p/what-those-studio-closures-mean-for" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GameDiscover.co newsletter</a> about Game Pass’s impact on Xbox’s first-party games, he acknowledged it was a tricky question. It’s difficult, he says, to work out what “success metric” Xbox is using for “expensive to make” boutique titles – it might be player counts, user ratings, retention, in-game purchase spend, new Game Pass users, or something else entirely. But he does note that as Game Pass growth stalled, the latter two metrics are increasingly becoming Xbox’s focus.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>“We can definitely argue about whether closing critically acclaimed studios like Tango Gameworks is the best way to deal with [Game Pass growth stalling out],” he says. “But I presume that, via Microsoft's new success lens -- 'did lots of people get retained in this game, and perhaps might pay for extra things in it?', or 'did new people signed up for Game Pass because of this game?', some beloved, high quality games don't fit the bill. For example, Hi-Fi Rush going to PlayStation is a high-profile move. But we're estimating it's sold way less than 100,000 units on that console so far. In a multi-billion dollar corporation like Microsoft, that's a rounding error.”</p><p>Van Dreunen, for his part, says Xbox is ultimately going to be fine. It has Microsoft, and thus time and money on its side, even if its parent company seems to be cracking down on the big spending. Microsoft won’t abandon gaming, and the big bets will likely continue, even if the shape of them seems likely to look less and less like Spencer’s Game Pass vision from a decade ago. “[Xbox] recently celebrated the 20-year anniversary of its Xbox console, which it introduced at great cost and amidst massive skepticism from analysts, gamers, and investors. Today, Microsoft is the third-largest game company in the world, generating $25 billion annually. As a trillion-dollar company it has the resources to outlast other companies for decades. I’d expect Xbox to use that to its advantage.”</p><p>And yet, the shuttering of Tango and Arkane was a massive shock to an industry already reeling from two straight years of relentless job and project cuts. The carnage across video games seems poised to continue for at least a few more financial quarters, and any rebuilding of the lost talent is likely to take far longer. Xbox is apt to sail the waves of the industry for years to come, whether or not Game Pass turns out to be the wind at its back or an anchor dragging it down. But Tango Gameworks and Arkane Austin are gone, and there may not be many studios like them for the foreseeable future.</p><p><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN. Got a story tip?

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-marketing-has-a-cryptic-puzzle-already-driving-fans-wild<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Ubisoft has hidden a cryptic puzzle across the marketing for <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/assassins-creed-shadows">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a>, previously codenamed Red, the Japan-set entry due for a full reveal tomorrow, May 15, 2024.</p><p>The Hourglass Puzzle was teased in Ubisoft's press release regarding the reveal, which was also announced publicly through a post on X/Twitter which showed a giant hourglass in Osaka, Japan. Fans were quick to spot a strange code on the bottom of this hourglass, S89N-029S, thus starting the community's problem-solving effort.</p><p>This wasn't too complex to work out, as its numbers were simply positions in the English alphabet, meaning it was quickly deciphered as 'Shinobis.' But the strange codes didn't stop there, as scattered throughout Ubisoft websites, email, and social media lay other random assortments of letters and numbers.</p><p>Spotted by <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/assassinscreed/comments/1cr379m/theres_some_sort_of_code_in_an_official_image_for/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Busy-Jicama-3474</a> on Reddit, a background image on the Assassin's Creed Shadows page on Ubisoft's website contains a hidden code with 24 two-digit numbers. Another code found in an email advertisement had 11, 21, and 33 repeated over and over across several lines, all being 16 numbers long. And fans are going wild trying to figure them out.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Assassin's Creed Codename Red becomes Assassin's Creed Shadows.<br>Tune-in for the Official Cinematic World Premiere Trailer on May 15, 9 AM PT.<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/AssassinsCreedShadows?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#AssassinsCreedShadows</a> <a href="https://t.co/xc1Q10N4Vh" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/xc1Q10N4Vh</a></p>— Assassin's Creed (@assassinscreed) <a href="https://twitter.com/assassinscreed/status/1790049553745412369?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">May 13, 2024</a></blockquote> <p>"If we pair the first and second numbers, along with the third and forth, and so on, we get four lines of eight pairs of numbers," wrote Squidpsyco in response to the original post. "The only pairs that exist here are 33 and 11, and 11 and 21. This creates eight pairs with exactly two possibilities for each pair, which looks a lot like binary.</p><p>"If we treat the 33 11 pair as zero and the 11 21 pair as 1, we get four binary characters, which translate to the American Standard Code for Information Interchange numbers one, five, seven, and nine. This can’t be a coincidence because the four binary strands all give a numeral, and only a range of 10 characters of the 255 possible are numbers. So the chance that this is a coincidence is (10/255)4 or 16 in six million odds."</p><p>The internet sleuth then connected that 1579 number to an Assassin's Creed Shadows rumor that suggests a historical figure called Yasuke will be involved in the game. "1579 just so happens to be the year Yasuke arrived in Japan," they said. "This probably doesn’t help with the main cipher on the website, but it is likely confirmation of the date of the game and Yasuke’s involvement."</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/05/14/screenshot-2024-05-14-124348-1715688836239.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Ubisoft's website hides a cryptic code and key.</figcaption></figure></output><p>This "main cipher" was found elsewhere on Ubisoft's website, where fans also found a code and key as one part of a series of rotating images. Several lines of numbers are presented next to the key, which contains Japanese Katakana characters.</p><p>The numbers were therefore converted to Katakana characters and translated to English by several fans online, revealing a cryptic poem. "Time is ephemeral, fragments are scattered across the network, the hourglass becomes the key to preservation, you should hurry," it reads, according to Reil_ on Reddit.</p><p>The hidden code in the background image can be translated using the same means, resulting in the phrase: "One by one, things come into existence. For the past, time stands still," according to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/assassinscreed/comments/1crah8m/shadows_hourglass_puzzle_solved/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Efigr</a>, who claims to have solved the riddles.</p><p>The page with the key also had a jumble of letters and numbers in a web address, which was easily converted to be "assassinscreed.com" through the same method used on the hourglass code, though its specific page is then edited out with nine question marks instead. But as the main paragraph mentions the hourglass being the key, Efigr deduced this as a likely answer.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div><h3>Mainline Assassin's Creed Games in Chronological Order</h3></div></output><p>While the code on the hourglass would be the most obvious (through it being the least obvious) answer, especially as it used the same decipher method, visiting 'assassinscreed.com/shinobis' returns a 404, page not found error. But visiting 'assassinscreed.com/hourglass' redirects users back to the main Assassin's Creed Shadow page.</p><p>"This redirects you to Ubisoft's homepage, it doesn't return a 404, probably meaning it's a page waiting to go live," Efigr said. It therefore appears Ubisoft wasn't fully prepared for fans to solve the puzzles so quickly, or perhaps the community has just reached the wrong conclusion.</p><p>If a page <em>is</em> waiting to go live, it will likely do so alongside the full reveal of Assassin's Creed Shadows on May 15 at 9am Pacific / 12noon Eastern / 5pm UK.</p><p>Despite the secrecy, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-codename-red-gets-official-name-ahead-of-wednesday-trailer-drop">leaks have confirmed a November 15, 2024 release date</a> for the incoming game. Set in feudal Japan, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-infinity-announced-with-two-new-games">Assassin's Creed Shadows was revealed in September 2022</a> as the "next premium flagship title and the future of our open world role-playing games", suggesting it will be closer in style to Assassin's Creed Valhalla and Odyssey than 2023's Mirage.</p><p>A leak in October 2023 gave fans their first look at <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-red-protagonist-seemingly-revealed-in-another-odd-ubisoft-leak">what's likely one of the game's protagonists</a>, a female assassin wielding a katana. Virtually nothing else is known about the game, however, but there's not long to wait until Ubisoft reveals a proper look tomorrow.</p><p><em>Ryan Dinsdale is an IGN freelance reporter.

<p>According to Sony's <a href="https://www.sony.com/en/SonyInfo/IR/library/presen/er/pdf/23q4_sonypre.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank">results presentation</a>, the Game &amp; Network Services arm of the business, which is essentially PlayStation and its associated studios, generated 4.268 trillion yen in sales (around $27 billion).</p>
<p>Per the company's accompanying <a href="https://www.sony.com/en/SonyInfo/IR/library/presen/er/pdf/23q4_sonyspeech.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank">speech transcript</a>, that figure constitutes 20.8 million PlayStation 5 unit sales, as well as 12 million sales for&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2&nbsp;</em>across twelve weeks, which puts the third-person shooter <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/god-of-war-ragnarok-sold-11-million-copies">ahead of&nbsp;</a><em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/god-of-war-ragnarok-sold-11-million-copies">God of War Ragnarok</a>&nbsp;</em>for the same period.</p>

Remember that the recent&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/helldivers-2-pc-playstation-account-link">controversy</a> surrounding the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/helldivers-2-pc-playstation-backtrack">need to have a PlayStation ID</a> to play on PC won't factor into this report given the timing.</p>
<p>Going forward, Sony says it expects PS5 unit sales to "gradually decline" given that the console is entering the second half of its life cycle. As such, Sony's expectation is that it will sell around 18 million PS5s this year.</p>
<p>Despite this predicted downturn in sales, Sony thinks it'll be able to "steadily increase sales and profits" from the PlayStation platform by building a stronger active user base and increasing user engagement.</p>
<p>As such, although gaming sales are predicted to drop to around 4.2 trillion yen next year, Sony expects profits in the sector to jump by around 20%.</p>

<p>The company says its plan for gaming is to drive profit by expanding its PlayStation install base, "providing richer gaming experiences", and focusing on PC releases, as well as "enhancing" its first-party software offerings.</p>
<p>These financial results come after Sony Interactive Entertainment <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/playstation-layoffs">laid off almost a thousand employees</a> around the world earlier this year, including staffers at studios like Insomniac, Naughty Dog, and Guerrilla.</p>
<p>Of course, that hasn't stopped Sony as a whole engaging in a share buyback scheme to massively boost its payout to shareholders this financial year, but then the PlayStation owner is <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ea-layoffs-share-buyback">hardly unique in that endeavor</a>.</p>

			<p>Today, former XCOM and Marvel's Midnight Suns designer <a href="https://wccftech.com/firaxis-games-enters-new-era-with-jake-solomon-departure-new-studio-head-new-civilization-in-the-works/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jake Solomon</a> announced the foundation of <a href="http://www.midsummerstudios.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Midsummer Studios</a>, a small indie company established with the help of several industry veterans who worked on games like Civilization (Will Miller) and The Sims (Grant Rodiek). This startup has already raised $6 million from investors like Transcend Fund, Tirta Ventures, Betaworks Ventures, 1Up Ventures, F4 Ventures, Krafton, and Day Zero Productions.</p>
<p>Solomon and his colleagues won't be making an XCOM-like game. They are instead building a next-generation life simulation game focused on player-driven narrative. I had a chance to speak to Solomon about Midsummer, this new project (which will be released on PC early access at first), and the state of the industry as a whole.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Midsummer-Fire-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p><strong>What can you tell me about the founding of this new company? How did you choose the name and everything?</strong></p>
<p>My family is Norwegian and I have incredibly fond memories of my family’s Midsummer celebration, which we still celebrate today. Honestly, it’s a good party. It is also a little bit about<br>
rebirth, a look to the future, and gathering with those important to you. Creating a new company is a big step, and Midsummer was a good fit for what we’re trying to build.</p>
<p><strong>You said you have 10 people now, right? Are you working from an office or remotely?</strong></p>
<p>We have hired 11 people and work in an office together in Hunt Valley, MD, just a little north of<br>
Baltimore.</p>
<p><strong>In the future, when you need to scale up, would you be open to hiring remote workers?</strong></p>
<p>We are actively discussing how to accommodate remote and hybrid team members as we grow the studio. It’s incredibly important to us that folks feel like they belong to the studio and our culture regardless of where they work. It’s not easy to get right, so it’s something we’re trying to figure out.</p>
<p><strong>Your debut game will be in the life simulation genre, which is quite a departure from your previous games. Is that a genre you always wanted to touch upon, or was it a spur-of-the-moment situation?</strong></p>
<p>I’ve always thought using systems-driven design to explore relationships is an interesting challenge. I’ve always been interested in building systems that facilitate player-driven stories. Back in XCOM: War of the Chosen, we added soldier bonds, and we arguably created a bit of a dating simulator in Marvel’s Midnight Suns.</p>
<p>Systems-driven games allow you to explore any theme: golf, building a city, managing soldiers, or leading little lives. There is absolutely a lot we are figuring out, but we feel this is ultimately still<br>
within our strengths as developers.</p>
<p><strong>One of the big differences compared to your previous titles would be the lack of combat, so there has to be some other way to resolve conflicts. Will that happen through dialogues?</strong></p>
<p>Great stories require strong characters with competing desires. Our new game won’t feature combat, but conflict and tension will be at the forefront. Life Sims sit at the intersection of game systems and player agency. We’re trying to find that balance between managing relationships to<br>
“play well” (so to speak) and also tell the story you wish to see. It’s a little early to discuss specifics of dialogues, but rest assured there will be tension!</p>
<p><strong>Will there be daily tasks, like jobs, that players have to perform? Would those entail any mini-games?</strong></p>
<p>Characters will go to their jobs in a small town. They can argue (or fall in love) with co-workers,<br>
deal with certain customers. Jobs are a great way to expose the minute details of life and inject<br>
big, major events. We’re building our first playable now, which will inform a lot of the moment-to-moment holes we need to plug. We’re not sure mini-games are the best fit, but it’s still early days and we’d be foolish to close off any potential avenues.</p>
<p><strong>Is it possible for players to fail in their endeavors, and would the game account for that?</strong></p>
<p>Players will absolutely fail! But it’ll be fun. Maybe they lose their job, get dumped, or botch a first<br>
date. There are so many fun ways to fail in a good story. We think failure is a great opportunity to highlight growth and perseverance in our characters, which helps make a better story. Plus, the occasional failure makes success so much sweeter.</p>
<p>Our game will not feature a game over screen, nor are we terribly interested in failure putting up<br>
“walls” and closing things off. In the spirit of improv theater, we see success and failure as opportunities to use consequences to inform the next part of the story and mix up the simulation.</p>
<p><strong>Based on the press release, the game will focus on delivering meaningful player-driven stories. Can you talk about how you're going to achieve this?</strong></p>
<p>There is so much work to do here, and we are still very early in development. Our current focus<br>
is to create the basic game systems that create narrative goals, conflict and relationships, and interactions within limits to accomplish those goals. We are trying to build choice-rich scenes<br>
with all of the choices leading to telling a story.</p>
<p><strong>Will the game have an end goal or end to a main storyline, or will it be more of an endless type of narrative?</strong></p>
<p>The game won’t end. We want to create compelling, episodic stories you can complete or<br>
continue. But each of these is a tiny snippet of an unfolding narrative. One of the best things about life simulation games is that they imitate life, which is enormous. As we support the game and hopefully see a mod community form, we are confident a creative community will create new stories forever.</p>
<p><strong>You have mentioned people sharing user-generated content online, but what about proper co-op multiplayer? Is that a possibility if players ask for it?</strong></p>
<p>We are not building co-op or multiplayer. This game is a single-player experience. We also think we can foster an incredibly collaborative, welcoming community of creators, even if they are not playing together in real time.</p>
<p><strong>What do you think about generative AI-based NPCs, like those in the Inworld AI demos?</strong></p>
<p>These are definitely cool. They definitely force the larger question of what they improve. Are<br>
they nifty technology or do they make the game more fun for players?</p>
<p><strong>Speaking of tools, can you share which engine you've selected for the game?</strong></p>
<p>We are using Unreal Engine 5.</p>
<p><strong>Will you leverage features like MetaHumans, Lumen, and/or Nanite?</strong></p>
<p>We are not using MetaHumans. We’ll use a lot of the incredible technology that Unreal Engine 5<br>
offers, but we are still prototyping our visuals and the technology we will use. One thing to note is that we want to build a small, sustainable studio. It’s important to figure out how to create a good-looking game with a style that does not require an enormous team.</p>
<p><strong>Can you talk about the visual style you'll be going for?</strong></p>
<p>We intend to use a stylized look, but the question is how stylized? We’re still figuring this out and don’t really know at this time. The main thing driving our work is how important it is for our players to be emotionally connected to their characters on screen.</p>
<p><strong>Do you plan to self-publish this game?</strong></p>
<p>We haven’t decided this yet. At this time, we have a variety of options, including self-publishing, or partnering with a publisher to help us bring the game to market.</p>
<p><strong>Are you targeting specific platforms?</strong></p>
<p>We have a lot of plans long-term, but right now, we are focused on bringing this game to the PC<br>
in Early Access.</p>
<p><strong>The life sim genre is suddenly getting a renaissance of sorts, with Paradox and KRAFTON making new games and, of course, the <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-sims-next-gen-project-rene-revealed-customization-cross-platform/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new The Sims</a> on the horizon. Do you feel like it's going to be too cramped?</strong></p>
<p>Even with all of these options, life simulation players are still underserved. There is so much still<br>
to be done. These are all serious competitors, all of whom seem poised to offer something great to players who love life simulations. But, if anything, all of us are just scratching the surface of what’s<br>
possible. The Sims created the genre 25 years ago with very few competitors. There are multiple<br>
successful FPS Battle Royales and nobody says the space is too cramped. We are confident<br>
we can create a delightful, distinct life sim worthy of its predecessors.</p>
<p><strong>What do you think about the state of the industry following all the layoffs? Is the doom and gloom warranted?</strong></p>
<p>Honestly, it’s terrible. Too many people have lost their jobs and it’s incredibly frustrating. It’s been nice to actually hire folks these last few months. The last few months have been terrible for a lot of folks, and hopefully, as Midsummer grows, we can provide a great studio home for some of them.<br>
It’s a tough market right now. There are these incredible, over-the-top AAAA games that are impossible to follow. You also see amazing AA niche games that are more focused and successful. AAA sits in this awkward middle ground where it’s very expensive but hard to cover costs.</p>
<p><strong>In many cases, we've seen budgets double or triple between one installment and the next one in a series. Should developers and publishers rein in budgets to avoid these mass layoffs?</strong></p>
<p>I’m wary of telling other folks how to run their business. But I can tell you what we’re doing at<br>
Midsummer. We want to make games in a small, collaborative atmosphere. We want to remain<br>
independent. All of those things require that we stay relatively small, act and spend our money<br>
in a sustainable manner, and make careful decisions on how we produce our games.</p>
<p><strong>Thank you for your time.</strong></p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/fortnite-maker-epic-games-fined-1-1-million-for-pressuring-youngsters-epic-appeals-decission/</link>

			<p>The Netherlands Authority for Consumers and Markets (<abbr title="Authority for Consumers &amp; Markets">ACM) has fined Fortnite maker Epic Games for pressuring youngsters.&nbsp;</abbr></p>
<p>As can be read in the <a href="https://www.acm.nl/en/publications/acm-imposes-fine-epic-unfair-commercial-practices-aimed-children-fortnite-game" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new publication</a> from the ACM, two fines have been imposed for a total of 1.125,000 euros. According to the ruling, the <a href="https://wccftech.com/epic-games-store-year-in-review-2023-user-grow-fortnite-third-party-dwindles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fortnite make</a>r has exploited the vulnerabilities of those under 18 by using unfair practices, including the use of "illegal" aggressive ads, and misleading countdown timers. For both violations, Epic has been fined 562.500 euros. In addition to these two violations, the ACM mentions that Epic uses several design features that can be characterized as a "dark pattern". According to the authority, certain items were still available for purchase, even after the countdown timer ended. "The offer was complex, and was presented in a way that made it impossible to be able to comprehend the offer, let alone under the pressure of a countdown timer of 24 hours", the publication reads.</p>
<p>“Businesses that offer products to children have a responsibility to keep in mind that children are particularly sensitive to certain incentives", ACM's Cateautje Hijmans van den Berg said. "In the popular game Fortnite, children’s vulnerabilities were exploited and were thus pressured into making purchases. With this decision, we are sending a clear signal: children must be able to play online games without being put under undue pressure. These practices by Epic erode confidence in the digital economy.”</p>
<p>In a statement <a href="https://tweakers.net/nieuws/221872/acm-geeft-epic-games-boete-fortnite-spoorde-kinderen-aan-tot-kopen.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">issued</a> to Dutch tech outlet Tweakers, Epic has said that it disagrees with the decision from the ACM and that it will appeal the decision. Epic has mentioned that accounts under 16 cannot make real-money purchases without permission and cannot use certain social features.</p>
<p>Until the appeal is settled, Epic has said that Dutch Fortnite players can no longer purchase items in the store that are available for less than 48 hours. In addition, the Fortnite maker has reaffirmed that countdown timers in the virtual store will disappear - something that the company already promised last month.</p>

            <link>https://www.polygon.com/24156221/helldivers-2-sales-record</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/helldivers-2-is-playstation%E2%80%99s-fastest-selling-game-ever.870168/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24156221/helldivers-2-sales-record<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="2417dB">In its <a href="https://www.sony.com/en/SonyInfo/IR/library/presen/er/pdf/23q4_sonyspeech.pdf">latest financial report</a>, Sony has revealed that <a href="https://www.polygon.com/gaming/24071317/helldivers-2-starship-troopers-video-game-great"><em>Helldivers 2</em></a> — the scrappy co-op shooter turned online gaming sensation from Sweden’s Arrowhead Game Studios — is the fastest-selling game PlayStation has ever released.</p>
<p id="FwASr4">Sony said <em>Helldivers 2 </em>sold 12 million copies in its first 12 weeks on sale, “surpassing the record set by <em>God of War Ragnarök</em> in the same period after its release in 2022.” <em>Ragnarök </em><a href="https://twitter.com/SonySantaMonica/status/1620844673924227074">sold 11 million copies</a> in the same time frame. Sony said <em>Helldivers 2 </em>sales “far exceeded expectations.”</p>
<p id="hLAm2f"><em>Helldivers 2’</em>s release strategy was unusual for Sony. It released simultaneously on PS5 and PC, via Steam, and at $39.99 had a lower price than the majority of first-party releases from PlayStation Studios, the console-maker’s development and publishing arm. Sony usually prices its games at $59.99 and above, and waits for a year or more before releasing them on PC.</p>
<p id="4szZvQ">There’s no doubt that Steam contributed massively to <em>Helldivers 2</em>’s success. Sales analyst <a href="https://twitter.com/MatPiscatella/status/1770800506446733615">Mat Piscatella said that</a>, in the game’s launch month, nearly 60% of its sales came from Steam, and it only recently fell out of the top 10 most-played games on the platform. “The game has become our biggest PC hit title to date, and as a multi-platform title, it also contributed significantly to sales and profit last quarter,” Sony said. </p>
<p id="pdLsnW">No surprise, then, that Sony plans to release all live-service games simultaneously on PlayStation and Steam going forward. It’s yet to make the same decision for its first-party single-player action games in franchises like Marvel’s Spider-Man, The Last of Us, and God of War, which are regarded as system-sellers for PlayStation consoles and currently held back as platform exclusives. You can be certain there will be spirited debates about the pros and cons of this policy within Sony after <em>Helldivers 2</em>’s success.</p>
<div id="MaoCuz">
<blockquote>
<div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>As announced in the Sony earnings call, we have sold over 12M units!</p><p>It's crazy to think that there are more Helldivers than there are Swedes  </p><p>What a massive achievement from everyone involved in realizing <a href="https://twitter.com/helldivers2?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@Helldivers2</a>. A massive thank you to the community for your support,…</p></div>— Pilestedt (@Pilestedt) <a href="https://twitter.com/Pilestedt/status/1790300010401104124?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 14, 2024</a>
</blockquote>


</div>
<p id="okwJ36">But Sony’s push into multiplatform publishing with <em>Helldivers 2</em> hasn’t been an unqualified success. When Sony attempted to reinstate a dropped requirement for Steam players to link a PlayStation Network account, it was met with <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24150510/helldivers-2-psn-account-sony-response-controversy-steam-review-bombing-refunds">a storm of dissent</a>, and ultimately had to drop the policy.</p>
<p id="OBlYPJ">Elsewhere in Sony’s financial report, the company revealed that PS5 console sales had reached 59 million, just behind the 60 million PS4s sold in the same period since its release. It expects PS5 sales to have peaked and to decline annually from here on out, though. Generally speaking, the financial picture for PlayStation is pretty rosy, with sales up 17% over the previous financial year — though it’s expecting a decline in the year ahead, with <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24072730/no-new-ps5-games-exclusives-2024-release">no major exclusive games to drive sales</a>.</p>
<p id="ojVKmo">Sony also announced a new CEO for Sony Interactive Entertainment, which runs the PlayStation business — in fact, <a href="https://sonyinteractive.com/en/press-releases/2024/new-leadership-structure-formed-at-sony-interactive-entertainment/">it announced two</a>. <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23893391/playstation-ceo-jim-ryan-retirement">Jim Ryan’</a>s replacements will be Hermen Hulst and Hideaki Nishino. Hulst, former boss of Guerrilla Games and current head of PlayStation Studios, will become CEO of the new Studio Business Group, with responsibility for game development and publishing as well as TV and film licensing. Nishino takes over as CEO of the Platform Business Group, running console hardware and services like PlayStation Network, sales and marketing, and third-party relations. Both men will report into the current interim CEO Hiroki Totoki in his role as board chairman.</p>
<p id="pjbFNj">It sounds like not much has changed here, with the hard-nosed Totoki (the probable architect of the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24084509/playstation-layoff-900-workers-feb-2024">recent PlayStation layoffs</a>, even though Ryan signed them off) carving up the kingdom and still pulling the strings.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-shadows-release-date-possibly-leaked-by-ubisoft/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>According to early views of Ubisoft’s own YouTube premiere trailer for Assassin’s Creed Shadows, the game’s release date is possibly November 15, 2024.</p>



<p>Ubisoft recently announced that Assassin’s Creed Shadows will get <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-shadows-gets-first-trailer-on-may-15/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">its first trailer</a> on May 15, unveiling at 9 AM pacific time. </p>



<p>The upcoming trailer is currently sitting in wait using YouTube’s premiere feature. In the premiere’s trailer description, it seemed that Ubisoft itself suggested the game will be available in November. </p>



<p>In <a href="https://twitter.com/wario64/status/1790079437662285907" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a new post</a> on Twitter, users @Wario64 and @Andreaalex2001 captured an image of this apparent slip-up.</p>



<p>However, the November release date is hardly concrete. It’s still possible that the date in the trailer description simply amounts to human error. It may have intended to refer to the trailer’s release on May 15 instead of November 15. </p>



<p>But Ubisoft did completely remove the text, implying the date is in fact legitimate. If so, the date could appear in the upcoming cinematic trailer.</p>



<p>Ubisoft has previously confirmed release dates in other game trailers. This included the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/star-wars-outlaws-release/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">August release date</a> for Star Wars Outlaws.</p>



<p>Recent reports suggest that Assassin’s Creed Shadows <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-shadows-wont-be-on-last-gen-consoles/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">won’t be available</a> on last-gen consoles. Further, a dataminer recently gave fans a glimpse at the game’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-shadows-dlc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">season pass and DLC prices</a>.</p>



<p>At this time, Ubisoft has not officially confirmed a release date for Assassin’s Creed Shadows, previously known as “Red.” Ubisoft plans to reveal more about the game during its Ubisoft Forward in June.</p>
