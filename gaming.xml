		<p>It’s getting to be pretty toasty out there, as summer feels like it’s truly arrived in the UK, just in time for last night’s Summer Solstice. Did you mark Midsummer’s night in any way? Perhaps you just looked out the window around 9:30PM and thought “Huh, it’s still pretty bright out, isn’t it?”</p>
<p>This week I’ve been playing more of Luigi’s Mansion 2 HD for our upcoming review of the Switch remaster, as well as returning to Crime Boss: Rockay City, to see how it’s come along for the Steam launch this week. I’ve also shared some quick thoughts on <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/06/20/cat-quest-3-preview-a-purrfectly-piratical-adventure/">Cat Quest 3</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/06/18/dragon-quest-iii-hd-2d-remake-is-the-remake-this-legendary-rpg-deserves/">Dragon Quest 3 HD-2D Remake</a>, and have some more games to talk about next week.</p>

<p><strong>Aran</strong> played SteamWorld Dig 2 this week, saying it’s “the perfect sequel to the original, with a fun story and fun gameplay.” I couldn’t agree more, and love its really distinctive take on the Metroidvania form.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, <strong>Ade</strong> has been away on holiday, and so has been leaning in on local multiplayer gaming. That’s meant&nbsp;TMNT: Shredder’s Revenge,<br>
Guacamelee!, Overcooked! 2 and Cake Bash, and he can heartily recommend the lot of them!</p>

<p><strong>Tuffcub</strong> has naturally mixed together Destiny 2 with some <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/06/17/still-wakes-the-deep-review/">Still Wakes the Deep</a> to wrap up our review, but has also been playing with Cubase and his CDJs as he’s got a big gig… tonight!</p>

<p>It was also Still Wakes the Deep for <strong>Nick</strong>, “which is very good.” And on the side, he’s been playing Street Fighter 6, Dead by Daylight and WWE 2K24.</p>
<p>Gamoc has had Minecraft with an S-tonne of mods, then Minecraft with a quarter tonne of mods. He’s also played Rebel Galaxy Outlaw, “which is basically a Freelancer clone”, as well as Warhammer 40K Rogue Trader, “which continues to be excellent but crashy.”</p>
<p>And we’ll round out this week with Steve:</p>
<blockquote><p>I have played some Survival: Fountain of Youth and Hauntii, just started Still Wakes the Deep which is braw (that’s Scots slang for good). My main gaming time involved my usual masochistic Next Fest Demo binge with about 120 demos played over the week (don’t ask me why, it’s just become a thing) including a fair few hours with Once Human – preview of this coming up soon. Loads of really exciting titles now added to my wishlist but desperately hoping that the PT ‘inspired’ horror game runs its course soon as almost every other horror tagged demo felt like the same house (often actually is the same Unity asset pack).</p></blockquote>
<p>Now then, what have you played? Holler in the comments below!</p>

The challenge with these emulators is that they don’t include any games. They rely on ROMs, digital copies of classic video games, that are plagued with complicated legal questions&nbsp;when it comes to using and acquiring them.</p><p>Antstream features a library of legally licensed retro titles that’s similar to the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/5/28/21271988/evercade-retro-games-handheld-review-classic-atari-namco-interplay">Evercade lineup</a> of gaming consoles, so users don’t have to visit the dark corners of the web to source their own. </p><p>There are <a href="https://www.antstream.com/games">hundreds of titles from ancient platforms</a> like the Commodore 64, the ZX Spectrum, and the Commodore Amiga, but you’ll find just 28 Atari 2600 games, five from the Game Boy, two from the original PlayStation, and 42 from the Super Nintendo. So, even with 1,300-plus games offered through the Antstream service, you might have to dig a little to find something you’ll actually want to play.</p><p>As much as we enjoyed the <em>Super Star Wars</em> trilogy on the SNES, that might not be enough to justify the price of an Antstream subscription. For a limited time after launching on the App Store on June 27th, subscriptions will be discounted to $3.99 per month or $29.99 per year, which is just slightly cheaper than the standard $4.99 per month or $39.99 per year that Antstream usually charges.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>German YouTube channel 'Digital Dreams' has released a new Cyberpunk 2077 showcase, aiming to imitate real life.</p>
<p>We've <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-unmatched-realism-path-tracing-8k/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">covered plenty of graphical showcases</a> for CDPR's hit title, including several <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-path-tracing-100-mods/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">from Digital Dreams</a>. Last year, we covered a showcase of the game running in 4K resolution with more than 100 mods, and today we wanted to share an impressive showcase of the game running in 8K resolution with over 300 mods on an NVIDIA RTX 4090. For the video, the content creator has used his own custom ReShade preset alongside an ultra path tracing mod as well as a real weather mod to simulate real life. As said, more than 300 mods were used in order to create this showcase, and the complete list of mods <a href="https://next.nexusmods.com/profile/haskeer212/mods" target="_blank" rel="noopener">can be downloaded via Nexusmods here</a>.</p>
<p>As expected, you'll need quite the setup in order to run CDPR's game with this many mods in 8K resolution. The following configuration was used:</p>
<ul>
<li>MB:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Gigabyte Aorus X670 AX</li>
<li>CPU:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ryzen 9 7950x</li>
<li>RAM:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Kingston Fury 6000MHz</li>
<li>GPU:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; NVIDIA RTX 4090</li>
<li>M2 SSD:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Samsung 970 evo</li>
<li>SSD:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Crucial MX500 2TB</li>
<li>HDD:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Seagate Barracuda 14TB</li>
<li>AIO WC:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Artic Liquid Freezer 420</li>
<li>PSU:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; be quiet! Straight Power</li>
<li>Fans:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Arctic P12</li>
</ul>

<p>Cyberpunk 2077 is available worldwide now for PC, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S, and Xbox One. <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-phantom-liberty-has-sold-more-than-5-million-units-in-2023/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">As reported back in January of this year</a>, the Phantom Liberty expansion has sold more than 5 million units in 2023. It will be interesting to see how further sales for both Cyberpunk 2077 and Phantom Liberty will evolve over time.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/metal-gear-solid-delta-native-4k/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-latest-trailer-shows-the-game-at-native-4k-resolution.907845/</guid>

			<p>The latest Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater showed the game running at native 4K resolution, as well as a very faithful recreation of some the original release's cutscenes.</p>
<p>A new analysis shared today by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2024-metal-gear-solid-delta-what-tech-does-the-new-remake-bring">Digital Foundry</a> confirms how the <a href="https://wccftech.com/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-new-trailer-provides-an-impressive-new-look-at-the-boss-more-gameplay/">trailer</a> showed almost two weeks back during this year's Xbox Games Showcase featured the remake running at native 4K resolution, with dynamic resolution scaling kicking in rarely. Unfortunately, it hasn't been specified from which version of the game the footage was captured, so it's too early to say if the console versions will indeed run at native 4K resolution, at least in the Quality or Graphics mode the game is likely to feature.</p>
<p>The video also features some very interesting comparisons between some of the original version's cutscenes and their Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater recreations, highlighting how the remake will essentially retain the same scene composition of the original while enhancing it using the Unreal Engine 5. In Snake's HALO jump cutscene that opens the game, for example, the engine's more accurate lighting allows more detailed and diffuse shadows across the characters while ambient occlusion shades in under collars and beneath hair. High-quality assets, improved reflections, more realistic cloud rendering, and better lens flare also play a big part in making the cutscene look amazing. The Unreal Engine 5 also allowed the developer to massively improve character rendering, as all characters sport new facial details, which make them look great even with the animations and motion capture used in the original.</p>
<p><iframe title="Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater - UE5 Remake vs Original - How Does the Trailer Stack Up?" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pmPyKTtaxhk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater launches on a yet-to-be-confirmed release date on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24182791/kingdom-planet-apes-4k-blu-ray-special-feature-no-cgi<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="SOK167">It’s no secret that <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24152375/kingdom-planet-apes-visual-effects-weta-fx-mocap"><em>Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes</em> is a visual-effects-heavy movie</a>. After all, there are only two human characters, and every other speaking part in the movie belongs to a CGI ape. But just because there are a lot of digital characters doesn’t mean the actors portraying them weren’t giving full performances. In fact, most of the characters were fully motion-captured, and the movie’s 4K Ultra HD Blu-ray is here to prove it. </p>
<p id="4lgc7A">The<em> </em><a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/24152022/kingdom-of-the-planet-of-the-apes-review"><em>Kingdom of the Planet</em> <em>of the Apes</em></a> 4K set includes a special version of the movie, dubbed <em>The Raw Cut</em>, that’s a split-screen version of the entire movie — one side is the finished film and the other is stripped of all the film’s visual effects. In other words, it’s just the actors in their mocap suits acting out the scenes as their ape characters. (<em>The Raw Cut</em> is not included in the Blu-ray or DVD releases of the movie — just the 4K Blu-ray.) </p>
<p id="t4Ys2E">On the one hand, this is probably a very awkward way to watch the movie in which you’re constantly confronted with the fact that the whole thing is just a bunch of people pretending to be monkeys. On the other hand, <em>The Raw Cut</em> is an excellent way to show off just how much work the actors are doing and how incredible their full-body performances are. </p>
<p id="xBPIzy">Showcasing the work of motion capture actors has never really been easy. First popularized with Andy Serkis’ performance as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G9HWSuptvNc">Gollum in <em>The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers</em></a> in 2002, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4NU9ikjqjC0">unfinished footage of actors performing in mocap suits</a> has provided insight into just how complicated the process is and how intricate the physical performance can be. But this <em>Kingdom </em>special feature shows one way filmmakers can show off just how incredible their films’ performers are, which is why it should become standard for every visual effects-heavy movie. </p>
<p id="SJsySE">The 4K UHD Blu-ray version of <em>Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes</em> is set to be released on Aug. 27. <em>The Raw Cut</em> will also include an optional commentary track featuring director <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24145926/zelda-movie-director-wes-ball-grounded-style">Wes Ball</a>, editor Dan Zimmerman, and VFX supervisor Erik Winquist. </p>

Scott is one of the original five team members and has been a lasting presence in the comics, movies, and TV shows starring Marvel’s mutants. But in the six decades Scott has been around, it only took six years to give people the wrong idea about the character.

As for the power potential of Cyclops, we constantly see him holding back. On a character level, this reflects his stance as team leader and one of the first students of Charles Xavier, who taught Cyclops he needed to control his powers to not scare humans. However, while in mourning for Jean, we do see him let his powers loose at the beginning of <em>X-Men: The Last Stand.</em></p><p>For many, the seemingly boring portrayal of Cyclops became the only version that existed. It wasn’t until <em>X-Men ‘97</em> that people really saw Cyclops as cool again, but this ignores a vital part of the puzzle—the comics. In the past two decades, Cyclops’s comic arc has been anything but boring. Starting in the 2000s with Grant Morrison’s <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/x-men-97-season-one-recommended-reading-comics-list-1851491472&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/x-men-97-season-one-recommended-reading-comics-list-1851491472"><em>New X-Me</em>n</a></span>, Cyclops is portrayed as a powerful team leader constantly at the forefront of the action. He’s one of the most important characters in Morrison’s entire run and constantly shows his combat and leadership prowess while also going through some compelling emotional journeys. The 2010s saw Cyclops become arguably the most important<em> X-Men </em>character in the comics, starting with <em>Avengers vs. X-Men</em>. In this story, Scott gains the power of the phoenix force and starts a massive conflict with the rest of Earth’s heroes that eventually leads to him <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/marvel-kills-superhero-icon-avengers-369942/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/marvel-kills-superhero-icon-avengers-369942/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">killing Charles Xavier</a></span>.

In Bendis’s run, Cyclops has become disillusioned with the decades-long fight of Charles Xavier being predicated on appearing as harmless as possible to humans, often at the cost of mutant safety. Cyclops is branded a terrorist and dedicates himself to a mission of saving persecuted mutants and fighting against the many groups trying to eradicate the species.<br></p><p>While I understand that the majority of people may have a picture of Cyclops based on the movies and other screen adaptations, I don’t think it’s fair to expect those to give the whole picture of a character’s identity. Also, I don’t actually think the movies do Cyclops as dirty as everybody says. But even if we want to argue that the movies give Cyclops a bad portrayal, it’s only one part of the picture, and in the two decades since James Marsden first appeared on screen as Cyclops, in the comics the character has continued being just as badass as fans have always known him to be. <em>X-Men ‘97</em> just reiterated what was always true about him. So don’t call it a redemption.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Yesterday, the solstice (Litha, as it’s known to some) brought us our longest day of the calendar year, and now we march on to ever darkening days. But right now, we’re just marching on into the weekend to spend that time off in some delightful digital realms. </p><p>Hopefully you’ve got some good games picked out for your weekend. If not, we have more than a few suggestions this week, including some <em>Dragon Age</em> homework to get busy with ahead of <em>Veilguard</em>’s release in the nearish future, another popular fantasy realm, and, oh, would ya look at that, <em>Starfield</em> is here again for the second week in a row. Some people just won’t learn. <br></p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="297634a333203d3eb6a13d8f85ea067e" data-recommend-id="image://297634a333203d3eb6a13d8f85ea067e" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A cast of strange characters stand before a statue." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A cast of strange characters stand before a statue." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->RedCandleGames</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="297634a333203d3eb6a13d8f85ea067e" data-recommend-id="image://297634a333203d3eb6a13d8f85ea067e" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A cast of strange characters stand before a statue." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p><strong>Play it on:</strong> PS4. Switch, Windows (Steam Deck: OK)<br><strong>Current goal:</strong> Defeat Goumang</p><p>Red Candle Games is an indie team based in Taiwan that shocked the world with its great horror games, most notably 2019's <em>Devotion</em>. It’s now pivoted to a completely different genre with <em>Nine Sols</em>, a side-scrolling action game in the mold of a 2D <em>Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice</em>. Combat is elegant, methodical and punishing as you journey through a gorgeous “Taopunk” world in search of revenge. The story is interesting, but sometimes feels like it’s intruding on the flow of the exploration and action. Fighting enemies, on the other hand, including bosses, feels crisp and rewarding. </p><p><br>There’s a deflection mechanic where timed parries build up chi that can be used to unleash exploding talisman attacks. You also take two types of damage, one of which you can recover from by not getting hit. Add in a long-range bow and sizable skill tree and there’s a ton of interesting stuff going on in <em>Nine Sols</em> that sets its encounters apart from your standard, dime-store Soulsborne Metroidvanias (even the ones I love). I’m pleasantly impressed so far, and while there’s not a Switch version yet, it reportedly runs great on Steam Deck. — Ethan Gach <br></p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="abf300fa6b86b69d8c36a557b68cb9e6" data-recommend-id="image://abf300fa6b86b69d8c36a557b68cb9e6" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1079" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Characters on horseback ride next to soldiers standing at the ready." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Characters on horseback ride next to soldiers standing at the ready." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->BioWare</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="abf300fa6b86b69d8c36a557b68cb9e6" data-recommend-id="image://abf300fa6b86b69d8c36a557b68cb9e6" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1079" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Characters on horseback ride next to soldiers standing at the ready." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p><strong>Play it on: </strong>PS4.

But despite all of that, <em>Inquisition </em>is probably my least replayed BioWare game from the past 20 years.</p><p><br><em>The Veilguard </em>is building off that game’s final moments, to the point where I can’t in good conscience recommend you play the new game without going back and playing <em>Inquisition </em>at least once. But maybe it’s time for my fourth playthrough. I miss my Tevinter husband. I miss watching the world of Thedas change before my eyes.

I remember liking it a lot! But I’ve not gone back to it much since it was first released. I’ve not even played the two DLC packs that came out later. I’m not sure why. Perhaps its launching right as covid lockdowns began and my wife lost her job, soured me on it. Or maybe those damn Marauders annoyed me too much. Who can say? Regardless, <em>Doom Eternal </em>and its DLC went on sale on Xbox and I decided to grab it and replay it on Xbox Series X at 120 FPS. </p><p><br>And folks, did you know that <em>Doom Eternal</em> is a really good game? I still think the game is a bit over-designed—having to balance grenades, a flamethrower, multiple mods, runes, and more doesn’t feel like <em>Doom</em>—but it’s still a blast. Whipping around rooms and dropping enemies with a shotgun still feels great. I can’t wait to play <em>Doom The Dark Ages</em> next year.

I won’t divulge <em>exactly </em>how far behind I am out of shame, but I’m deep into some really cool shit, and even if I’m not entirely caught up by the time <em>Dawntrail </em>launches, I’m just glad to be carving out time for this game again. I know that I love a bunch of other games more than I love this one, but I don’t know that many other worlds and characters feel as comforting to just come back to as the ones in <em>FF14</em>.

But even FromSoftware knows a fair warning about what’s coming can go a hell of a long way. So, take it from one who has traversed the Realm of Shadow and (sorta) lived to tell the tale, there’s a few things I can tell those who will be walking in Miquella the Kind’s footsteps. Here are X things I wish I had known before starting <em>Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree</em>.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195624" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Top 10 Most-Played Games On Steam Deck: August 2023 Edition" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="279" data-playlist="195624,196773,195502" data-current="195624"><div><p>The Top 10 Most-Played Games On Steam Deck: August 2023 Edition</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195624/195624_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195624/195624_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195624/195624_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195624/195624_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21125.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><h2 id="h118355"><a id=""></a><br><strong>You <em>did</em> kill Starscourge Radahn and Mohg, Lord of Blood already, right?</strong></h2><p>Because as FromSoftware itself has mentioned, if you didn’t, you ain’t going nowhere just yet. While those two boss fights are optional to get to the base game’s ending, they’re now required to be able to access the DLC.</p><p>For returning Tarnished for whom Mohg’s already dead, the entrance to the DLC is right in Mohg’s boss room, southeast on the Underground map. The Site of Grace is called Cocoon of the Empyrean. You’ll know you’re good to go, because there’ll be an NPC there to bid you welcome. When you’re ready, interact with the arm sticking out of the cocoon, and strap in.</p><figure id="" data-id="5f7e7f34d11a17ccc393a5b32c661c49" data-recommend-id="image://5f7e7f34d11a17ccc393a5b32c661c49" data-format="jpg" data-width="3840" data-height="2160" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A map showing the location of the DLC entrance." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A map showing the location of the DLC entrance." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->FromSoftware / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="5f7e7f34d11a17ccc393a5b32c661c49" data-recommend-id="image://5f7e7f34d11a17ccc393a5b32c661c49" data-format="jpg" data-width="3840" data-height="2160" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A map showing the location of the DLC entrance." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><h2 id="h118356"><a id=""></a><strong>And you <em>did</em> actually install the DLC, right?</strong></h2><div><p>It’s not as bizarre a question as you might think. I’ve spoken to multiple folks before launch who had a similar problem, where Radahn and Mohg are dead, but there’s no prompt at the cocoon. Well, as it turns out, <em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em> is its own separate install from the main game, and while buying it unlocks access to it, it doesn’t seem to automatically download the extra data. If you wanna make absolutely sure, on PS5 and Xbox, from the main menu, press Start/Options on the tile for <em>Elden Ring</em>, go to Manage Game, and while <em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em> should be there, it may require a proper download, which will be another 16GB.</p></div><h2 id="h118357"><a id=""></a><strong>Make sure to look out for Miquella’s Crosses</strong></h2><p>One of the first things you’ll notice when you start out on the Gravesite Plain, aside from one of those wild chakram ninja things kicking your ass, is there’s a new symbol visible on the road, a golden cross with a crescent moon.</p><div><p>It looks kinda like those crosses the people who got Tanged in <em>End of Evangelion</em> turn into. Turns out, that’s kind of an apt comparison too: These are Miquella’s Crosses, and while not all of them have a Site of Grace nearby, the ones that don’t all have a Scadutree Fragment—<em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em>’s new stat-enhancing items. Also, they typically have an NPC who’ll reveal a little more about what exactly is going on in the Realm of Shadow. These are also the folks you’ll be able to summon during the critical path boss fights. Make friends with them, they’re nice. Not by choice, but still.</p><p>These markers also serve a nifty passive purpose. Interact with them, and you’ll read the words carved into them by Miquella. The vast majority will just tell you that here, Miquella abandoned his flesh, but the mission-critical areas of the DLC will detail a body part Miquella shed here. A new body part notes you’ve reached the next stage of the story, and this means, unless you’re in a big rush to see the ending, it’s worth going back where you came from to explore more. Why? Because what’s next is definitely about to mess your shit up in a novel way. Speaking of....</p></div><figure id="" data-id="d130e6308a386cb67030ba3869f08bc4" data-recommend-id="image://d130e6308a386cb67030ba3869f08bc4" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Kicking a baddie right in his baddie face." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Kicking a baddie right in his baddie face." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->FromSoftware</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="d130e6308a386cb67030ba3869f08bc4" data-recommend-id="image://d130e6308a386cb67030ba3869f08bc4" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Kicking a baddie right in his baddie face." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><h2 id="h118358"><a id=""></a><strong>The enemies are gonna hit a whole lot harder</strong></h2><p>If you’ve already beaten Radagon and the Elden Beast at least once, you’re in a good place to tackle the DLC from a sheer skill perspective. In terms of raw numbers, I’d recommend being at around the level 120 mark before jumping in.</p><p>For this writer’s part, going into it, my main character was a lvl 157 tank on two legs wearing the Bull-God armor set with a Dragon Towershield. Some of the most dangerous bastards walking the Lands Between have tried to put a dent in me and had all the impact of a spitball. And then I walked into <em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em> and spent the first few hours getting clapped up in two hits by basic enemies.</p><p>Sure, being high-leveled is a nice idea, especially since weapons and magic are just as effective as before, but even at high levels, the attack stats on the new enemies wandering the Realm of Shadow scale up accordingly. For quite some time, if you don’t respect their damage output, they will put an end to your journey in a hurry. Even more than the base game, <em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em> is less about how much you can get hit and keep getting back up, but rather avoiding getting hit as much as humanly possible. That means, for tanks, you’re definitely going to want to find a way to knock your Equipment Load down to a point where you keep a medium roll. You’re gonna need it.</p><h2 id="h118359"><a id=""></a><strong>Hunt down all the new enhancement items</strong></h2><div><p>So, the good news is that even though it’s still gonna kick your ass, <em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em> has its own special enhancement items to jack up your stats throughout your journey. Scadutree Blessings can be found at every single one of Miquella’s crosses, as well as a special drop if you chase down any of the shadowy folks carrying pots on their heads. These specifically boost your attack and defense stats. Meanwhile, Revered Spirit Ash Blessings can be found on statues of Miquella found throughout the Shadow Realm. These power up your Spirit Ashes, though you can’t actually see those numbers nor how much they go up.</p><p>Both work much like Golden Seeds, in that you’ll need more and more of them to level up over time. In the early going, it’s worth wandering around the Gravesite Plains areas before Ellac Greatbridge to collect the first few, in order to make earlier major challenges a bit easier on yourself. Oh, and there is one major downside: they’re only effective in the Realm of Shadow. So don’t go thinking you’ll get out of here and one-shot Malenia or something.</p></div><figure id="" data-id="9cad0089f37a6470adf1c19f13b57b14" data-recommend-id="image://9cad0089f37a6470adf1c19f13b57b14" data-format="jpg" data-width="3840" data-height="2160" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="I'm pretty sure this character was in the Labyrinth." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="I'm pretty sure this character was in the Labyrinth." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->FromSoftware</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="9cad0089f37a6470adf1c19f13b57b14" data-recommend-id="image://9cad0089f37a6470adf1c19f13b57b14" data-format="jpg" data-width="3840" data-height="2160" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="I'm pretty sure this character was in the Labyrinth." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><h2 id="h118360"><a id=""></a><strong>Know what you’re fighting for</strong></h2><p>There are a few different types of minor Dungeons scattered around <em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em>’s Shadow Realm. If you’ve frequently run into that dilemma of wondering if all the beatdowns you’re about to take will be worth the risk, let’s make it nice and simple:</p><p>If it’s a Catacomb, you’re getting a Glovewort by the end (i.e. the items you need to level up Spirit Ashes) and a new Spirit Ash.</p><p>Ruined Forges will get you weaponry (and, usually, a bunch of the resources you need to upgrade them).</p><div><p>If it’s a Gaol, you’re getting a Hefty Pot.</p></div><h2 id="h118361"><a id=""></a><strong>Go west, life is slightly less terrifyingly violent there</strong></h2><p>Near the start of the DLC, you’ll literally come to a crossroads. One direction leads across a massive bridge with a gorgeous view, another leads to an imposing castle guarded by a giant scorpion, and the last leads to a swamp and a diseased village.</p><p>Not that we’re telling you what to do, it’s your life, but we strongly suggest taking the road west to Belurat first. For one thing, there’s another Miquella cross in front of it for an easy Scadutree Fragment. For another, there are two other NPCs to meet over there. And third, despite being a fairly lengthy area, it’s actually maybe the “easiest” task to take on in the early going.</p><div><p>The place is loaded with at least one new and useful item for any and every class. The boss, Dancing Lion, is no joke, and may put you in the dirt a few times, but the reward for taking him down is one of the most versatile (if obstructive) pieces of armor in the early game: the Divine Beast Head. At this stage, it all leads to a dead end at the top of the tower, but, when you’re headed back out and east a few levels stronger, you’ll be thankful for the detour.</p></div><figure id="" data-id="10a06be9e4538eadeb84f5aeb1812242" data-recommend-id="image://10a06be9e4538eadeb84f5aeb1812242" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Wiglett makes a cameo appearance in Elden Ring." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Wiglett makes a cameo appearance in Elden Ring." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->FromSoftware</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="10a06be9e4538eadeb84f5aeb1812242" data-recommend-id="image://10a06be9e4538eadeb84f5aeb1812242" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Wiglett makes a cameo appearance in Elden Ring." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><h2 id="h118362"><a id=""></a><strong>Look up (and down) more</strong></h2><p><br>One of the fascinating things about the Realm of Shadow is that it’s a lot more vertical than much of the Lands Between. Objectives are often further up than you think, the best way out of a sticky situation may be the platform 100 feet under you. Meanwhile, shortcuts into special areas might need you to go spelunking without a parachute.</p><p>As such, it’s an extremely good idea, if you haven’t already, to pump a few more points into Dexterity, since it governs your fall damage. Yes, you can do that old trick of stripping off your armor and jumping down, but there are a few of those types of jumps where there’s a group of new, extremely trigger-happy baddies waiting at the bottom. Tread lightly, but not stupidly.</p><h2 id="h118363"><a id=""></a><strong>You don’t need to just march right into Shadow Keep</strong></h2><p><br>Once you’ve looted the Gravesite Plains area and made it to Scadu Altus, the next big obstacle is the Shadow Keep. It’s a massive, ruined kingdom full of magic, mystery, and, for some reason, giant crabs. It’s actually so massive that it almost functions as its own little contained overworld. Sure, you can walk up to the front door and knock, but there are a couple of side entrances and exits as well, with switches and secrets that unlock other parts of the keep for exploration. And of course a couple of hard-as-nails boss fights in there too. The Scadutree Avatar, in particular, can kiss the blackest part of my ass. A three-phase battle? At that part of the game? In this economy?</p><p>Anyway, point being, you’re going to hit a big brutal wall at a few points tackling this place, and it’s worth remembering it’s worth maybe circling around a bit, especially to the west, and finding another way in, or indeed looking around for some new ways to kill some of the high-level baddies roaming around.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>A Red Faction sequel was pitched and approved by Embracer before studio closures and job cuts killed the project. That’s according to a new report from<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/how-embracers-cuts-killed-a-potential-red-faction-sequel-and-gutted-a-promising-studio" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow"> Rock Paper Shotgun</a> (RPS), that claims Embracer canceled a “visual prototype” for a Red Faction sequel in 2023.</p>



<p>Developer Fishlabs worked on it internally as Project White, and was working to develop something along the lines of 2009’s Red Faction: Guerilla. The pitch involved the aforementioned visual prototype to show to direct parent Plaion for approval.</p>



<p>According to the report, the game was pitches “several times” to Plaion, with an elaborate one happening in November 2023. That pitch, RPS says, also featured cosplay for the executives.</p>



<p>“In addition to screening the “fake trailer”, team members posed as characters from the game, with the Red Faction resistance group “hacking” a presentation given by a sinister corporate agent,” the story reads.</p>



<p>According to what RPS was told, reaction to the pitch was positive with a belief that the game would be greenlit for development. That ultimately didn’t happen after an internal vote was split 50-50, halting any chance of the game’s creation. After the game’s cancellation, Fishlabs management was told to “lay off almost everyone not attached to an active game project.”</p>



<p>As far as what the game would’ve been about, the new Red Faction game would’ve been set 100 years after Guerilla on a “more terraformed and colorful Martian world map.”</p>



<p>“There were plans for a female protagonist, who would once again take part in an underground workers revolution,” RPS said. “There would likely have been a range of factions, from predatory corporations to homegrown Martian communities, with whom you might have had to forge alliances to complete your objectives.”</p>



<p>Insider Gaming has reached out to Embracer, Plaion, and Fishlabs for comment on the report. As of publishing, no response has been received.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/the-nintendo-switch-saved-metroid<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Has any Nintendo hardware done more for Metroid than the Nintendo Switch? Sure, the SNES is home to the best Metroid game of all time and the GameCube ushered in a revolutionary perspective change. But now, with Metroid Prime 4: Beyond coming to the Nintendo Switch in 2025, and nearly every other great Metroid game available to play on the handheld, it’s time to ask the question: Did the Nintendo Switch save Metroid?</p><p>It’s not beyond the realm of possibility that Metroid was, at one point, very much at risk of being shelved. Metroid has never moved <em>serious</em> numbers and <a href="https://vgsales.fandom.com/wiki/Metroid" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>according to all available data</u></a>, the total sales for <em>every</em> Metroid game combined is somewhere around 22 million units. To put that into perspective, The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild alone has sold 32 million copies. </p><p>But what Metroid and Samus lacked in sales success, it more than made up for it in brand recognition. Nintendo fans who don’t like Metroid games at least know of it, and Super Smash Bros. kept Samus in front of gamers for years, even when there weren’t new Metroid games to play. Now, on the Nintendo Switch, Samus is ever-present, even if that wasn’t always the case.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/06/18/metroid-prime-4-beyond-announcement-trailer-nintendo-switch-0-33-screenshot-1718722693568.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Metroid Prime 4 is real and coming to Switch. Credit: Nintendo</figcaption></figure></output><p>Of Nintendo’s many beloved characters, perhaps nobody is as fascinating as the enigmatic bounty hunter, Samus Aran. When Metroid was released in 1986, the sci-fi, Alien-inspired search-action game was released and would go on to spawn a genre unto itself.</p><p>For older Nintendo gamers looking for something new, Metroid was a revelation. Where Zelda and Mario put players in wide, open worlds of bright hues, Metroid was dark and cramped. Its creature designs were downright terrifying and the central Metroid plotline was a direct reference to one of cinema’s scariest, face-hugging aliens. </p><p>Metroid filled a more mature niche within the Nintendo stable, but as a result never found the same financial success as the more all-ages games. </p><p>In 2010 Nintendo released Metroid: Other M to tepid sales and perhaps worse critical reception. Commercial disaster and the inability to recapture the magic of Metroid Prime could have spelled the end of Samus. It didn’t, but it did take six years before the next Metroid game was released, the very-much forgotten Metroid Prime: Federation Force (coincidentally a minor character from that 3DS game is apparently a main villain in Metroid Prime 4). Other than a well-received 3DS remake of Metroid 2 a year later, Samus was all but missing from the Wii U and early Switch years. </p><p>It seems distant now but this was the era Metroid fans began to seriously fret over the future of the series. Other than various re-releases of older Metroid games, the only real project seemingly in development was Metroid Dread, a game that was first referenced during the Nintendo DS era and entered two decades of development hell.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2021/10/06/metroid-dread-1633526505786.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>A shot in the arm. Credit: Nintendo</figcaption></figure></output><p>However, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/metroid-dread-review-nintendo-switch">Metroid Dread did eventually find its way to the Nintendo Switch</a>, almost 20 years after it began development. Even more surprising, Dread – a throwback to the old 2D style of Metroid games – is the best-selling game in the series at over 3 million units sold. Not Zelda numbers, sure, but the numbers were heading in the right direction.</p><p>Combining the old-school 2D style of Metroid with a Resident Evil 2-like persistent enemy that takes the game to borderline horror territory, Metroid Dread was a shot of adrenaline for the series and quickly became one of the best games to play on the Nintendo Switch. But it’s not just because Nintendo released one of the best Metroid games of all time on the Switch that I believe the handheld console saved Metroid – it’s because Nintendo released <em>all</em> of the best Metroid games on the system.</p><p>Consider the Metroid library currently available on Switch. There’s the aforementioned Dread, a truly <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/metroid-prime-remastered-review">remarkable remake of Metroid Prime</a>, Metroid Fusion, Super Metroid, the original Metroid, and now Metroid: Zero Mission all available to play on the Switch so long as you have either a digital copy of the game or a subscription to the Nintendo Switch Online library.</p><p>Almost overnight the Nintendo Switch became the ultimate entryway for old — but more importantly new — fans to discover Metroid. In the digital age, old games in particular are incredibly hard to come by and while Nintendo might not have fans among some sectors of the digital preservation community, the Metroid series at least is thriving on the Switch.</p><p>Some of these games, like the Game Boy Advance titles Metroid: Zero Mission and Metroid Fusion, are still relatively pricey on the secondhand market, while others like the full Metroid Prime Trilogy still remain trapped on obsolete consoles like the Wii. But for curious fans looking to get into the full Metroid offering, they can’t do better than pick up a Nintendo Switch.</p><p>Nintendo has hardly showered any one console with more Metroid than the Nintendo Switch. And given the Switch’s humongous install base, making Metroid easy to access will hopefully only continue to grow that fanbase for the future.</p><p>Now, with Metroid Prime 4: Beyond on the horizon, and <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/was-metroid-prime-4-running-on-switch-2">still confirmed for the Nintendo Switch</a> rather than the Switch Successor, the Metroid parade on Nintendo’s hybrid system continues. And while individual consoles like the SNES, GameCube, and GameBoy Advance can boast about having released the best Metroid games of their generation, only one system — the Nintendo Switch — has all of them, ready to play at a moment’s notice.</p><p><em>Matt T.M.

With the proprietary ThrustmapperX software, you can customize the sensitivity levels of the analog sticks or remap the controller's many buttons.</p><p>Along with tactile buttons, a clicky D-pad, and back buttons, the controller uses locking latches for the triggers so they can be actuated faster than a standard gamepad. The controller's modularity means you can swap around the analog sticks and D-pad to better fit your needs. So regardless of whether you prefer the left analog stick to be above or below the D-pad, the eSwap X2 is a great option.</p><p>Additionally, you can swap out any components that get worn down over the years without needing to replace the entire controller. </p><p>Here's a quick look at what you'll find inside the box:</p><ul><li>eSwap X2 Controller</li><li>2 interchangeable mini-stick modules</li><li>2 interchangeable grip modules</li><li>2 interchangeable triggers</li><li>1 interchangeable D-pad module</li><li>2 additional mini stick caps</li><li>Power cable</li><li>Screwdriver for removing modules</li><li>Storage bag</li><li>Quick Start guide</li></ul><p>The Elden Ring version of the Thrustmaster eSwap X2 controller arrives on September 30. Though it's unfortunate that the controller isn't available for Shadow of the Erdtree's launch, dedicated Elden Ring fans will probably still be playing the expansion a couple months from now. </p><div data-embed-type="pinbox" data-ref-id="4304">  <ul>                              <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/lord-of-the-rings-4k-blu-ray-box-set-amazon-preorder/1100-6524366/">Lord Of The Rings 4K Blu-Ray Steelbook Collection Is Back In Print, Preorders Live At Amazon</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/official-xbox-controllers-get-significant-discounts-at-amazon-and-walmart/1100-6524341/">Official Xbox Controllers Get Significant Discounts At Amazon And Walmart</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/zelda-links-awakening-is-back-in-stock-for-40-at-amazon/1100-6511630/">Get Ready For Zelda: Echoes Of Wisdom With This Great Link's Awakening Deal</a></li>                          <li>         <span>+ Show More Best Gaming &amp; Tech Deals This Week Links (2)</span>       </li>          <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/save-big-on-nintendo-switch-joy-con-controllers-at-amazon-and-walmart/1100-6523566/">Save Big On Nintendo Switch Joy-Con Controllers At Amazon And Walmart</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/inside-out-2-fans-should-check-out-the-new-lego-mood-cube-set/1100-6524400/">Inside Out 2 Fans Should Check Out The New Lego Mood Cube Set</a></li>   </ul> </div>

"Brave Tarnished, we call upon you now. It's time to return to the Lands Between, and enter the Realm of Shadow.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/monster-hunter-wilds-open-world-leap-is-thanks-to-growing-global-popularity<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-module="content" data-testid="article-base-body-content"><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The Monster Hunter series has been steadily building toward players and the large-scale battles they undertake into a more open world experience. With recent entries leaning into the scope of its setting, Capcom's daunting and equally thrilling monster-slaying action game has grown since finding its way back to consoles after years on handhelds, and the next game is bringing about the most significant changes the series has seen yet.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Following the breakthrough success of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Monster Hunter World</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, which brought an even larger audience to the series, Capcom aims to have </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Monster Hunter Wilds</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> shake up the established structure and flow for the series' first open world game. This intended shake-up hinges on bringing the series' epic battles into a more dynamic and interconnected world that's rife with emergent encounters against large-scale creatures and a more hostile ecosystem that evolves in real time.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">At Summer Game Fest 2024, we saw an extended demo of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Monster Hunter Wilds</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and spoke with series producer Ryozo Tsujimoto, executive director and art director Kaname Fujioka, and game director Yuya Tokuda about how the next game puts its new open world in the spotlight, and how </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/monster-hunter-world-hits-over-23-million-units-sold">the massive success of the series</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> has led them to rethink Monster Hunter for a global audience.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="What does an open world structure mean for Monster Hunter?">What does an open world structure mean for Monster Hunter?</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Since its debut in 2003, the Monster Hunter series has focused on a timed mission-based structure that led players into excursions through connected zones to hunt key targets. This fragmented, excursion-style approach is what the series has been built on, but following the success of Monster Hunter World and its experimentation with a larger sandbox and more narrative worldbuilding—which now stands as Capcom's best-selling game—the shift to a more seamless and dynamic Monster Hunter game was something that executive director and art director Kaname Fujioka felt was vital for </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Wilds</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"The seamlessness of the game is really one of our core efforts in designing Monster Hunter </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Wilds</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, and ever since World, we've always wanted to design the ecosystems and the environments more detailed and immersively," said Fujioka. "That aspect necessitates the kind of seamlessness of the world where we can have all these concepts running together, all within an environment that feels threatening and filled with hostile monsters that you can freely hunt."</span></p><p>Image via Capcom.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Much like previous Monster Hunter games, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Wilds </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">sees players take on the role of hunters contending with an unexplored locale that's teeming with new wildlife to battle and resources to collect.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Though </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Wilds </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">absolutely retains this conceit, the private demo shown at Summer Game Fest presented a detailed look at an average session in the game, which showed the new systems that actively ditch some of the series' more steadfast and hardened rules as it moves the series to a more seamless and organic world.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">There's a clear focus on giving players a more freeform approach to being a hunter of large monsters, allowing for more room to comfortably explore the setting and choose targets without a timer. Instead of starting in the town hub to gain new quests, restock on items, change load-outs, and squad up before going on an instanced expedition, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Wilds </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">now brings a more modern open world experience akin to </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Horizon Zero Dawn</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> or </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Ghost of Tsushima</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, wherein towns, activities, and hunts are within the world and engaged without any loading screens.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In the demo, the hunter moved from a desert settlement filled with merchants and other explorers into the large biome on their mount. The hunters can now observe and track monsters, including the new herds of roaming monsters in each biome and new plant life and resources to collect with. Along with more monsters and critters, there are also NPC hunters who can join you if you need assistance. After completing a hunt, the player can keep exploring to try another hunt or retreat to town or an improvised camp in the field to cook food and recover.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">A clear focus with </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Wilds </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">is that the developers are more focused on keeping players in the world, instead of being ferried back to safety to start a new mission. By moving Monster Hunter away from the established excursion structure, and into a more explorable and evolving world, the developers want players to be more active in contending with the myriad of systems at work.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"We also focused a lot on the type of interactions you can find when exploring, like with packs of monsters, chasing down hurt targets, and how they conflict with other human hunters," said the executive director. "We also have these characters with 24-hour patterns of behavior that are much more involved than in previous titles. These details all show not only how seamless and organic the world is, but also how dynamic it feels."</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Monster Hunter’s global success is sharping the series’ direction">Monster Hunter’s global success is sharping the series’ direction</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The other significant innovation in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Monster Hunter Wilds</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> is the new evolving ecosystem, which sees real-time shifts to the weather and monster population. During the demo, we saw a sandstorm occur during a hunt. Conditions got worse when a violent lightning storm kicked in, which made the environment even more hostile. While the devs were chasing the target on their mount, we saw monsters in the areas scurrying to safety to avoid the weather hazards, which heightened the need to complete the hunt quickly. The terrain also became unstable, with one area turning into a massive sand pit that sucked in some minor monsters. This level of emergent, environmental gameplay, somewhat in the vein of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, is something that the series has toyed with, but now it looks to be far more ingrained in the flow of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Wilds' </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">core gameplay.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">That dynamic aspect of the world actively becoming hostile towards you, yet still teeming with activity to appreciate, was something that game director Yuya Tokuda wanted for the series. Still, it hasn't been possible till now, thanks to new technology.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"One of the biggest things that we've been able to challenge ourselves with in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Wilds </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">is building out a massive, changing ecosystem that not only incorporates more monsters but other characters within the world that also interact with those monsters," said Tokuda. "Along with those heightened interactions, these different environmental changes are happening simultaneously. That's something that the technology we have now has made possible, which we couldn't do before, and I think we did a good job bringing that all together."</span></p><p>Image via Capcom.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">While Monster Hunter games have been about the experience of being a hunter, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Wilds</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, and its focus on having players contend with the environment while keeping their targets in sight, heightens that by adding somewhat of a survivalist twist. With players having to compete in an open world with an evolving ecosystem and more active shifting of flora and fauna, the hunters in the game will have to be more adaptable to change— which includes building camps (that can be destroyed by monsters) and using new gadgets like camouflage to stay in hiding. Coupled with a more fleshed-out and structured world to explore, it's an intriguing and sensible shift for the series that really ups the hunter experience that the series excels at.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">For series producer Ryozo Tsujimoto, the success of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Monster Hunter World </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">offered some important lessons for Capcom—not only in terms of building up the next Monster Hunter game but also for making a new game that feels modern and in tune with the series' global audience.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"From the get-go, we approached Monster Hunter World with a global mindset," said Tsujimoto. "At that point, we had approached things by releasing in Japan first and following up with other territories, but World was our first worldwide simultaneous release for Monster Hunter. It was also the first game we made with so many forms of localization."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"That seems obvious to say, but that was a challenge for us initially because, with that global approach, we had to open up the series to other Capcom members across the globe to give opinions and input on the kind of direction the series would be going on," he continued. "That was a great challenge and lesson for us, but another thing we learned and wanted to focus on more with Wilds was taking greater consideration and care for players who haven't played Monster Hunter in a long time and how we can kind of get them back in the saddle."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Given how the series had steadily grown and built up a large audience to become one of Capcom's key franchises, seeing Monster Hunter embrace a more open world experience, leaning further into the epic scale of the battles and environments, is exciting. It also showcases the immense growth that Capcom has had in the last decade with its focus on reinvesting in its core franchises—much like Resident Evil, the Monster Hunter series is also going through its own transformation.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">By moving away from its modest and old-fashioned structure to a more open-ended game, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Wilds</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> showcases just how weird and wondrous the Monster Hunter universe has always been. It looks to be the series' first true effort for players to really get to know its setting on a moment-to-moment scale—and that's a great change for the series.</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author(s)</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Contributor</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Alessandro Fillari is a writer/editor who has covered the games, tech, and entertainment industries for more than 12 years.

			<p>Microsoft has issued an official statement about the recent Xbox Black Myth Wukong delay.</p>
<p>The Xbox Series X and Series S versions of Game Science's highly-anticipated Black Myth Wukong were recently delayed.</p>
<p>While an August 24 release was confirmed for both PC and PS5, the Xbox versions were delayed indefinitely for optimization reasons. "PC and PS5 users can enjoy the full game starting August 20, 2024", the official FAQ reads. "We are currently optimizing the Xbox Series X|S version to meet our quality standards, so it won't release simultaneously with the other platforms. We apologize for the delay and aim to minimize the wait for Xbox users. We will announce the release date as soon as it meets our quality standards."</p>
<p>Following the delay, many suggested that the lower-powered Xbox Series S might be causing problems when it comes to optimizing the game. While we don't know if this is the case, an official statement from Microsoft (<a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/hotly-anticipated-black-myth-wukong-is-delayed-on-xbox-for-optimizations-and-now-microsoft-has-responded" target="_blank" rel="noopener">via</a> WindowsCentral), might suggest that that there's some sort of exclusivity deal in place. While the statement doesn't directly state as much, one reading between the lines could argue that this might be the case. "<em>We’re excited for the launch of Black Myth Wukong on Xbox Series X|S and are working with Game Science to bring the game to our platforms. <strong>We can't comment on the deals made by our partners with other platform holders</strong>, but we remain focused on making Xbox the best platform for gamers, and great games are at the center of that."</em></p>
<p>As noted by WindowsCentral, Game Science has already announced that the game would be coming to Xbox Series, PS5, and PC. As such, exclusivity deals are a bit of a problem for Game Science. Then again, Microsoft hasn't directly said that this is the case, and this is merely speculation at this point.</p>
<p>What are your thoughts on this matter? Is Black Myth Wukong indeed struggling on the Series S? Or might Sony have struck some sort of timed-exclusivity deal with Game Science? Only time will, but you might as well let us know what you think.</p>
<p>Black Myth: Wukong launches on August 24 for PlayStation 5 and PC. Be sure to also check out the trailer that Game Science <a href="https://wccftech.com/black-myth-wukong-gets-short-but-sweet-new-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">released</a> last month.</p>

Currently, the community is full of posts of players being taken aback by just how hard the new content is. Everyone had a sense it would be extra challenging.

In part that’s because <em>Erdtree </em>contains a new Scadutree Fragments-based upgrade system <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/Eldenring/comments/1dl3hyn/unpopular_opinion_new_difficulty_system_is_badly/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Eldenring/comments/1dl3hyn/unpopular_opinion_new_difficulty_system_is_badly/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">to make characters more powerful</a></span>.

I suspect that as players explore more of <em>Erdtree</em> they’ll figure out ways to conquer its challenges and potential builds that might save them from getting pummeled to death in a lightning-quick tw0-second combo. And that’s one of the best parts of <em>Elden Ring</em>: players meeting up IRL and online to swap stories of narrowly overcoming the odds and the strategies that finally helped them do it. And it sounds like <em>Erdtree</em> will require that kind of community collaboration even more than the base game.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/microsoft-issues-statement-on-black-myth-wukong-xbox-delay/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>In <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/hotly-anticipated-black-myth-wukong-is-delayed-on-xbox-for-optimizations-and-now-microsoft-has-responded" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a new report</a> from journalist Jez Corden of Windows Central, a Microsoft spokesperson issued a statement about the Black Myth: Wukong Xbox delay.</p>



<p>The spokesperson reportedly gave Corden the following statement:</p>



<p><em>“We’re excited for the launch of Black Myth Wukong on Xbox Series X|S and are working with Game Science to bring the game to our platforms. We can’t comment on the deals made by our partners with other platform holders, but we remain focused on making Xbox the best platform for gamers, and great games are at the center of that.”</em></p>



<p>The statement is careful to remain vague, and it does not address concerns over the Xbox Series S console.</p>



<p>Corden does not confirm anything, either. But they speculate that by “reading between the lines,” it’s possible Xbox is referring to an exclusivity deal.</p>



<p>Fans originally expected Black Myth: Wukong to release on Xbox at launch, alongside PC and PlayStation. However, developer Game Science <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-myth-wukong-wont-be-on-xbox-at-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recently confirmed</a> the delay for Black Myth: Wukong’s Xbox version.</p>



<p>In an <a href="https://www.heishenhua.com/news/detail?id=11" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">FAQ section</a> update, the devs explained that “we are currently optimizing the Xbox Series X|S version to meet our quality standards.”</p>



<p>Black Myth: Wukong is set to release on August 20, 2024, and pre-orders are available now. During the Summer Game Fest 2024 event, the devs revealed all of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-myth-wukong-pre-order-bonuses-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the pre-order bonuses</a>.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/this-week-in-gaming-business-saunas-and-shutdowns</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/this-week-in-gaming-business-saunas-and-shutdowns.907779/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/this-week-in-gaming-business-saunas-and-shutdowns<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>It's once again the time of the week when we turn to what's been happening on the business side of things, and this week, three studios have been shut down, so we're off to a pretty glum start already, unfortunately.</p>
<p>A rather bizarre story involving a Polish developer's odd sauna-based requests for potential staff members also surfaced this week, so it certainly hasn't been an uneventful few days.</p>
<p>Here's our latest gaming industry roundup!</p>
<h2>Studio closures abound</h2>
<p>This week saw three studios shutting down, starting with&nbsp;<a href="https://x.com/galvanicgames/status/1801685792416498112" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Wizard with a Gun&nbsp;</em>developer Galvanic Games</a>, which said earlier this week that the game's sales are "not strong enough to sustain our studio".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/wizard-with-a-gun-dev-shut-down-gaming-business-roundup.jpg?itok=BKJwbfkR 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/wizard-with-a-gun-dev-shut-down-gaming-business-roundup.jpg?itok=EL1En6Mm 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Wizard with a Gun</em>&nbsp;hasn't sold well enough to ensure its studio's continued existence, unfortunately.</figcaption></figure><p><em>Alone in the Dark&nbsp;</em>studio Pieces Interactive also <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/alone-in-dark-developer-pieces-interactive-shut-down">closed its doors this week</a>, and while no official reason was given, parent company Embracer Group <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/embracer-group-financials-70-projects">admitted last month</a> that sales for the survival horror reimagining were underwhelming.</p>
<p>The third studio to close down this week was&nbsp;<em>Life by You&nbsp;</em>developer Paradox Tectonic, which was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/life-by-you-paradoxs-sims-competitor-has-been-cancelled">shuttered</a> after its game was rather unexpectedly canceled. The move angered at least one former Paradox Tectonic employee, who took to LinkedIn to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/life-by-you-dev-cancellation">share his thoughts in no uncertain terms</a>.</p>
<p>While it hasn't quite closed down,&nbsp;<em>Venture to the Vile&nbsp;</em>developer Cut to Bits also <a href="https://x.com/megamasao/status/1803802074766819726" rel="noopener" target="_blank">let most of its staff go</a> this week, in a rather gloomy coda that belies the increasing sunshine (in the UK, at least).</p>
<h2>Embracer Group's report shows a seismic loss of employees</h2>
<p>Beleaguered holding group Embracer released its annual report this week, and it was full of info regarding the company's future direction, including its focus on projects in the pipeline and its <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/embracer-group-ai-annual-report">embracing (ahem) of AI</a>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/embracer-group-layoffs-closures-saints-row-gaming-business-roundup.jpg?itok=N6IkN0Oz 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/embracer-group-layoffs-closures-saints-row-gaming-business-roundup.jpg?itok=v-_kF-Rq 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Embracer's closures and layoffs have seen over 5,000 employees let go.</figcaption></figure><p>One figure that was notable in the report, however, was the 2023-24 fiscal year's employee total, which numbered "over 11,100", according to Embracer.</p>
<p>Compared to its 2022-23 employee count, that means that over 5,000 Embracer employees have been let go, which includes the thousands of employees divested from the company as part of the sale of Saber Interactive.</p>
<p>If you want to know more about what's been going on over at Embracer Group, I'd recommend this <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/how-embracers-cuts-killed-a-potential-red-faction-sequel-and-gutted-a-promising-studio" rel="noopener" target="_blank">excellent Rock Paper Shotgun writeup</a>, which discusses the death of a possible&nbsp;<em>Red Faction&nbsp;</em>game and the gutting of&nbsp;<em>Chorus&nbsp;</em>developer Fishlabs.</p>
<h2>EA executives laugh all the way to the bank</h2>
<p>These numbers might paint a pretty glum picture of the gaming industry as it currently stands, but EA's C-suite has nothing to be sad about right now (except, well, being EA's C-suite).</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/ea-sports-fc-24-gaming-business-roundup.jpg?itok=EP6CA7XU 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/ea-sports-fc-24-gaming-business-roundup.jpg?itok=StnlFFUj 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>EA hasn't let layoffs stop it from handing its C-suite a serious amount of cash.</figcaption></figure><p>This week, EA <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ea-ceo-25-million-income-layoffs">released its 2024 Annual Meeting and Proxy Statement</a>, and in that document, the company discloses that CEO Andrew Wilson made $25.6 million in the 2023-24 fiscal year.</p>
<p>In total, EA's NEOs - that stands for Named Executive Officers, in case you thought it couldn't get any more dystopian - made over $60 million despite the fact that the studio has <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/electronic-arts-to-lay-off-5-of-its-workforce-amid-refocus-on-owned-ip-and-sports-games">laid off hundreds of employees</a> this year.</p>
<h2>Nintendo is at it again</h2>
<p>Nintendo is no stranger to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/creators-of-switch-emulator-yuzu-surrender-to-nintendos-demands-and-settle-out-of-court">jealously guarding</a> its IPs from, uh, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-takes-down-legend-of-zelda-links-awakening-dx-hd-port-for-pc">fans who want to do something</a> to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-axes-smash-world-tour-without-any-warning">celebrate</a> how much they love those IPs, and this week, the Japanese gaming giant was at it again.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, Nintendo <a href="https://torrentfreak.com/nintendo-takedown-wipes-rhythm-heaven-remix-tool-and-250-forks-from-github-240619/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">sent a DMCA notice</a> to the creators of a&nbsp;<em>Rhythm Heaven&nbsp;</em>fan tool which allows players to create their own musical remixes, despite the fact that the last official&nbsp;<em>Rhythm Heaven&nbsp;</em>game was released in 2015 on a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/3ds-wii-u-online-service-shutdown-date">now-defunct console</a>.</p>
<p>The&nbsp;<em>Zelda&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Mario&nbsp;</em>studio is renowned for its ruthlessness when it comes to shutting down fan projects, but somehow, this one feels particularly cruel. Come on, Nintendo. Give the&nbsp;<em>Rhythm Heaven&nbsp;</em>fans a break!</p>
<h2>A story of saunas</h2>
<p>We close today with a rather bizarre story about Polish developer Spectrum Studios, its creative director&nbsp;Jacek Piórkowski, and, uh, saunas.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, Piórkowski found himself in hot water (yup) over <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/spectrum-studios-games_spectrum-studio-is-working-on-new-groundbreaking-activity-7203194177315155970-SO7e" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a post</a> describing his studio's new game, which is an ambitious-sounding mix of&nbsp;<em>Life Is Strange</em>,&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy</em>, and&nbsp;<em>Uncharted</em>, all with added saunas.</p>
<p>Strangely,&nbsp;Piórkowski said in the post that interested applicants for his studio would need to attend "not negotiable" sauna sessions in order to understand saunas, which are a core part of the game since the player will take the role of a sauna owner.</p>
<p>Piórkowski found himself in further trouble when comments he made to writer Aleksandra Wolna, in which he suggested his "narrative girls" had to visit the sauna with him to come up with an "amazing script", <a href="https://x.com/BartekMoniewski/status/1802787361992138805" rel="noopener" target="_blank">emerged</a>.</p>
<p>Per <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/polish-developer-apologises-following-criticism-for-naked-sauna-job-requirement" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Eurogamer</a>,&nbsp;Piórkowski has since "apologized", although his apology contains the usual evasive non-apology statements: "my choice of words was bad", "I didn't state my intentions clearly", et cetera.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For her part, Wolna is sad that the sauna controversy took away from the original reason for&nbsp;Piórkowski's comments, which were posted on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/aleksandra-wolna-6736a1227_i-wasnt-paid-cd-action-gave-people-in-my-activity-7207509477401538560-bRgr/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">one of Wolna's posts</a> lamenting a situation of non-payment involving publisher All in!

<p id="uPeLnz">In <em>Altered</em>, players explore a fanciful post-apocalyptic setting where the world outside the city of Asgartha has been completely transformed. It’s up to players to conduct successful expeditions, becoming the first player at the table to reunite their deck’s main character and a lovable sidekick. </p>
<p id="RBfR1G">“It’s a chaotic place with lots of volatile ideas,” said <em>Altered</em> narrative designer Yoshi Mimura. “The [player character] is an Alterer, [and] the power of the Alterer is to shape the world around them so that they can stabilize the regions where they meet to help [make] the world a more sustainable and livable place.”</p>
<p id="tqvI4j">It’s a game about creation, not destruction, and Mimura says that The Sandman has an important role to play.</p>
<p id="YdTH5Q">“Lyra tend to focus on imagination, and stories, and legends, and everything that is transmitted orally,” Mimura said. “The Sandman is kind of a creator of worlds, and a person who can shape dreams. They can inspire people, and by doing so we can try to make the world a better place. It’s also a character that is profoundly linked to a personal hero of mine, Neil Gaiman.”</p>
<p id="jpIJCA">When players pull cards from a blind pack in <em>Altered</em>, they have the chance to pull either the common of the more rare versions of The Sandman. The rare version above, which retains its Lyra faction allegiance, costs one less to play from a player’s reserve <em>and</em> allows for a boost of two to be optionally placed on top of it. That makes it cheaper to play, <em>and</em> more powerful in the field. </p>

<p id="SsQadJ">Both versions of the card also allow a player to apply a status, called Asleep, to another Character on the table. According to one of the game’s designers, François Jourdain, the Asleep status can be used either defensively or offensively. The easiest way to use it would be to put an opponent’s character to sleep, removing them from the ensuing conflict and allowing you to make progress against your opponent. But you can also use it on <em>your own</em> characters: Asleep can prevent them from participating in a combat they are sure to lose, or players can proactively place characters asleep in order to bring them forward in following rounds more cheaply or alongside more powerful allies. It’s a debuff, a feint, and an attack strategy all in one.</p>
<p id="tEtEVP">A third, even more rare version of the card applies those same powers but to a different faction. This one, called <a href="https://www.altered.gg/our-world/factions/ordis">Ordis</a>, opens up even more and different strategic possibilities. Mimura was quick to add that other versions of The Sandman will likely surface in the future.</p>
<p id="E6xOhJ">“When you materialize a character from imagination,” Mimura said, “you can feed it with your own vision of what the character is. [...] So maybe in the future [...] he will have a completely different face, or maybe it will be women. We try to have all the options open to showcase a lot of diversity.” </p>

And then there’s you, more than likely still trying to get your <em>Elden Ring</em> sea legs back, trying to figure out where to go, until you wind up a little ways west of a burned down shanty town, through a nest of birds, headed down into a mausoleum where certain death is waiting with his best friend, his crossbow. As it turns out, though, the Blackgaol Knight is the only thing standing between you and some of the best bits of armor for your early travels. Guess you might as well kill him.

That’s generally his go-to whenever you’re out of stabbing range, but even when you’re in range, he’ll occasionally charge up his Greatsword and fire a devastating wave of energy, followed up by a deadly and delayed sweeping slash. Thankfully, aside from two moves that will absolutely disrespect your life bar, he’s your run-of-the-mill knight battle, taking random swipes at you with his Greatsword in one- or two-hander modes, occasionally going for a kamikaze flying attack when he’s feeling fancy. He’d be kind of a pushover if only all of his attacks didn’t hit like a ten-ton hammer.</p><h2 id="h459"><a id=""></a><strong>Strategy: Defeating The Blackgaol Knight</strong></h2><p>So, fun twist, this is a boss fight where you can’t actually summon any Spirit Ashes. You are utterly on your own for this one. How delightful.</p><p>Anyway, once you enter the boss room, lock onto him, and run to the left or right, circling closer to the Knight while he fires his barrage of arrows. If you’re lucky, you’ll escape unscathed, but taking one or two arrows at the end of the barrage isn’t the end of the world. When he’s done firing, he’s open for a few seconds while he reloads. The Knight is particularly vulnerable to magic, so now’s your cue to fire at will, magic users, though, as usual, you’re better served keeping a safe distance. For melee builds, your openings are plentiful, but short. Pick a weapon with a nice balance of power and speed that you can cancel out of easily, but don’t get greedy.</p><p>Once you’re close enough, the Knight will get into melee mode with his Greatsword. While in one-handed mode (sword slung over one shoulder), his attacks are quick, but a nimble player can dodge around him pretty easily for backstabs, and it’s not hard for magic users to stay out of striking distance, as long as you don’t fire anything with too much charge time. For tanky players, if your poise is high enough with a decent Greatshield, the Knight’s one-handed attacks will bounce right off your shield, leaving him wide open to get slapped around for a hit or two. Eventually, he’ll roll out of harm’s way, and you do not want to be mid-swing when that happens. Again, don’t get greedy. His aerial attack is devastating, but leaves him wide open for a backstab if you dodge it right.</p><p>Two-handed mode is where things get more dangerous, though, as he’s prone to long combo strings that never end where you want them to, and do a serious number on your stamina if you try to block him with a shield. More than that, he’ll often break his combo by going directly into his wave attack. The wave is easily dodged; the follow-up attack is not, thanks to some odd timing, but it’s not impossible. The trick here is distance: staying far enough away to avoid his combos, but close enough to punish him when he stands still. The wind-up for his wave attack *seems* like a good time to lay the smackdown, and if you’re close enough to him, you might get lucky where it’s one of the times he doesn’t go for the follow-up swipe, but it’s still a dangerous risk. </p><p>Once you’ve done enough damage, he’ll pull a Flask of Crimson Tears. That’s annoying, but 1), he’s wide open when it happens, and 2), he can only do it once. Patience and persistence are the order of the day here.</p><p>Is it worth it, though? Is it worth it, though? Well, the rewards are the Solitude Armor Set, and the Greatsword of Solitude, all utterly invaluable in the early goings in the Realm of Shadow. So, yeah. Worth it. So, yeah. Worth it.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>It seems as though Sony is officially giving up on virtual reality (VR). According to a new report from <a href="https://www.androidcentral.com/gaming/virtual-reality/sony-no-longer-cares-about-the-psvr-2-and-you-shouldnt-either" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Android Central</a>, Sony has continued to make cuts to its PlayStation VR development since the release of PS VR2.</p>



<p>The outlet states that sources have told them that Sony is “making deep cuts to funding for VR games.” They continued to say that they were told that there will be “very few opportunities for VR game development at Sony going forward.”</p>



<p>“To back that up, another source informed me that only two PS VR 2 games are in development at Sony,” the report continued.</p>



<p>Sony launched the PS VR 2 in February 2023 for $549.99, a price higher than the PlayStation 5 console that’s required to utilize it. Since then, there have been varying reports of the state of the headset, including <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sony-pauses-psvr2-production-sales/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a complete pause on production</a> due to sales. One simple search on any forum or social media site shows fans frustrated about the lack of new games coming out for it. </p>



<p>Sony did recently <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-vr2-pc-adapter-is-coming-august-7-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announce a new adapter launching in August</a> that will allow owners to use their PS VR2 headset with their PC. </p>



<p>Insider Gaming has reached out to Sony for comment on the report. As of publishing, however, no response has been received.</p>

            <p>Embracer Group – which has reduced its headcount by 4532 employees in the past financial year – wants to harness AI to "empower" its staff, saying artificial intelligence "has the capability to massively enhance game development by increasing resource efficiency".</p>
<p>In its latest <a href="https://embracer.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Embracer-Group-publishes-Annual-Report-20232024-240620.pdf">annual report</a>, as spotted by <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/gaming-industry/embracer-embraces-a-human-centric-ai-policy-says-vague-stuff-about-how-it-will-massively-enhance-game-development/">PC Gamer</a>, Embracer privacy and AI governance head Tomas Hedman stressed it would be a risk if the company <em>didn't</em> use AI, as it would put the firm at a "competitive disadvantage [with] other industry players".</p>

<p>"Certainly, one of the major risks for a company is not to use AI, as this would mean a competitive disadvantage vis-à-vis other industry players," Hedman said. "Most companies will move forward on AI integration in different ways. For us, it is the way that we do this that is the most critical element.</p>
<p>"We do not want to replace people with AI, we want to empower them," Hedman added. "This is the core of our human-centric approach to leveraging the potential with AI.</p>
<p>"It's not just that AI enables our developers to do even more, and to become more efficient on certain tasks, it will also open up coding to a broader group of developers. Entry into the industry might be easier for individuals with disabilities who, for instance, cannot use a keyboard as easily as others."</p>
<p>Hedman also says AI could help "in the creative process" by "identifying inconsistencies in scripts and storytelling", as well as scriptwriting, image creation, idea generation, quality control, "and more".</p>
<p>"As [gaming] models become more human-like, the interaction between players and AI-supported functions will be much more dynamic. If in a game scenario you bargain, AI can remember this the next time. That makes the whole gaming experience much more interesting and lifelike," Hedman added.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/alone-in-the-dark-reboot-developer-closed-by-embracer">Pieces Interactive – the developer behind the recent Alone in the Dark reboot – was shut down by Embracer</a>.</p>

<p>The studio is the latest casualty from Embracer, which <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/embattled-publisher-embracer-sells-off-saber-assets-withdraws-from-russia">sold off its Saber assets</a> in March and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/take-two-acquires-borderlands-studio-gearbox-from-embracer-for-460m">Gearbox to Take-Two</a> the same month for $460m.

                <p>According to a new report, a Red Faction sequel was in development at one point before the project was canceled during Embracer's months-long period of layoffs. While this new game in the series was pitched to higher-ups shortly after original Red Faction studio <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/saints-row-studio-volition-shut-down-just-after-30-year-anniversary/1100-6517393/" data-ref-id="1100-6517393">Volition had shut down</a>, developer Fishlabs felt that it had the necessary experience to resurrect the series.</p><p>As reported by <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/how-embracers-cuts-killed-a-potential-red-faction-sequel-and-gutted-a-promising-studio" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Rock Paper Shotgun</a>, Fishlabs put together an elevator pitch in trailer form to sell Embracer-owned publisher Plaion on the idea. The visual prototype was built in Unreal Engine 5 and the plan was to create a game similar to 2009's Red Faction: Guerrilla, but it was never greenlit and the project was canceled by November 2023. Not long after, Fishlabs studio leadership was reportedly instructed to lay off almost every staff member not involved in an active game project and mass layoffs began soon thereafter.</p>

<p>This wasn't the first time that Embracer had flirted with the Red Faction franchise, as back in 2019, Red Faction: Guerrilla Re-Mars-tered was released by the company. This version of the game had better visuals and even more impressive physics-based destruction. Its 2011 sequel, Red Faction: Armageddon never received the same treatment.</p><p>Overall, Embracer has embarked on a series of drastic cuts lately, partly due to a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/embracer-group-loses-undisclosed-2-billion-deal-amid-challenging-year/1100-6514494/" data-ref-id="1100-6514494">major deal falling through</a>. This was later revealed to have been a pact with <a href="https://www.axios.com/2023/08/14/saudi-arabia-savvy-games-embracer-group" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Saudi Arabia's Savvy Games</a> that fell through, and eventually <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/embracer-canceled-29-games-and-laid-off-1400-people-in-just-the-last-six-months/1100-6521108/" data-ref-id="1100-6521108">29 unannounced games were canceled and 1,400 people lost their jobs</a>. Embracer Group is also <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/embracers-name-is-going-away-ceo-denies-its-due-to-backlash-and-controversy/1100-6522930/" data-ref-id="1100-6522930">splitting up into three distinct companies</a> and it has recently discussed its <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/embracer-outlines-plans-for-ai-and-acknowledges-potential-risks/1100-6524396/" data-ref-id="1100-6524396">plans to to use artificial intelligence technology</a> to "empower" its employees during the game development process.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/06/21/dune-awakening-direct-delves-into-character-creation-and-servers/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Funcom has hosted a second Dune: Awakening Direct to reveal more details about its upcoming MMO, set in an alternate history Dune universe. This direct addresses things like the character creation system, how spirituality plays a part in the game, and how the server structure is set up to make Dune: Awakening a seamless MMO experience.</p>
<p><iframe title="Dune: Awakening Direct – Episode 2" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/sBRo-cotgkQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>“Dune: Awakening” unfolds in an alternate universe where Paul Atreides never existed, and House Atreides survives the attempt to destroy it. This setting grants Funcom the freedom to craft a unique narrative within the Dune universe, empowering players to make characters who can&nbsp; influence the world without Paul overshadowing everything. The war between House Atreides and its enemies does continue on the surface of Arrakis, yet the Emperor has decreed that the Spice must continue to flow without any hindrance.</p>
<p>One of the core mysteries of Dune: Awakening is the disappearance of the Fremen. They have left behind remnants of their society, and their disappearance also leaves a vacuum of power that different factions are trying to fill. It is not confirmed if the Fremen do still exist, or if they have been wiped out completely. The narrative diverges from the original books and movies, as certain characters who would have perished still live, and various factions are advancing their agendas without Paul’s influence.</p>
<p>In Dune: Awakening players will come into contact with different religious and spiritual beliefs, which differ from group to group. This feeds into the overall story of how the various groups and sects clash with each other for dominance of Arrakis. This influences the gameplay as players will experience the mystical trials of the Fremen and explore various belief systems. It’s important to understand that although Paul was on the Messiah’s journey in the original Dune story, the player’s character does not assume the same role of the Messiah.</p>

<p>The character creation screen at the start of Dune: Awakening will present a lot of customisation options to shape your character, though there are presets for those who want to just delve straight into the game. As you would expect from a character creator, you can change your body type, skin tone, hair style, eye colour, eye shape, age, facial hair, and height. Additionally, you ca adjust the thickness of arms and legs, the length of your character’s neck. The creator allows the addition of freckles, scars, tattoos and vitiligo as well.</p>
<p>After sorting the physical appearance of your character, you will determine their past. Choosing where you were born will impact the dialogue options open to you in Dune: Awakening, and also grant a unique emote associated with your birthplace. Following on from birthplace, your character’s caste is chosen, determining where in the strict hierarchy they land. The next choice is confirming who your character’s mentor was, and this grants a starting ability. This does not lock your character into a class or archetype, allowing for experimentation with more abilities as you make progress.</p>
<p>On the MMO aspect, it has been confirmed Dune: Awakening will have multiple servers and players can move between servers. There is an Overland map which connects various sandbox maps together. In the Deep Desert, hundreds of players can explore a map spanning at least 500 square kilometers. Meanwhile, in the social hubs of Arrakeen and Harko Village, the number of players is limited, but there are plenty of activities and vendors to interact with. The Hagga Basin serves as the starting area for a server, accommodating at least 40 players. Players have the option to select their starting Hagga Basin and can coordinate with friends to join the same one.</p>
<p>The Dune Awakening closed beta is currently underway on PC, and you can sign up through the<a href="https://duneawakening.com/"> Dune: Awakening website.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/crash-bandicoot-n-sane-trilogy-sales<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Activision has announced that&nbsp;<em>Crash Bandicoot N. Sane Trilogy&nbsp;</em>sales have passed a major milestone almost seven years after the collection's initial release.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://x.com/CrashBandicoot/status/1803820991555965395" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a post on X (formerly Twitter)</a>, Activision reveals that the game, which packs in remakes of the first three&nbsp;<em>Crash Bandicoot&nbsp;</em>platformers, has managed to sell 20 million copies since it <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/crash-bandicoot-n-sane-trilogy-hitting-shelves-june-30th">launched on June 30th, 2017</a>.</p>
<p>The 20 million figure puts&nbsp;<em>N. Sane Trilogy&nbsp;</em>on a par with massively successful games like&nbsp;<em>Hogwarts Legacy</em> and&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-has-shipped-13246-million-units-tears-of-kingdom-sold-almost-20-million"><em>Tears of the Kingdom</em></a>&nbsp;and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-sales-25-million">just behind titles like&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring</em></a>, although it's obviously taken&nbsp;<em>Crash&nbsp;</em>longer to achieve its sales figure than it took those two games.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/crash-bandicoot-n.-sane-trilogy-sales-platforming.jpg?itok=Tgokg0UQ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/crash-bandicoot-n.-sane-trilogy-sales-platforming.jpg?itok=univXzI- 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Crash Bandicoot N.

Sane Trilogy&nbsp;</em>well ahead of its successor (although&nbsp;<em>N. Sane&nbsp;</em>also has a near-three-year headstart).</p>
<p>Schadt's figures also say that&nbsp;<em>Spyro Reignited Trilogy</em>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/updated-spyro-dragon-is-back-in-spyro-reignited-trilogy">another collection</a> of three classic PS1 platformers from Toys for Bob, hit 10 million sales, and that game launched just over a year after&nbsp;<em>N. Sane</em>, so it looks like Crash wins this one.</p>
<p>If you're wondering exactly what&nbsp;<em>Crash Bandicoot N. Sane Trilogy&nbsp;</em>is, it's a collection of the first three mainline&nbsp;<em>Crash Bandicoot&nbsp;</em>platformers, namely&nbsp;<em>Crash Bandicoot</em>,&nbsp;<em>Crash Bandicoot 2: Cortex Strikes Back</em>, and&nbsp;<em>Crash Bandicoot: Warped</em>.</p>

            <p>An unannounced Helldivers 2 stratagem has leaked online, seemingly by a Sony email.</p>
<p>The unforced error – which came via an official marketing email sent out to Helldivers – proudly introduces the Airburst Rocket Launcher players unlocked after they successfully liberated Penta during Operation Legitimate Undertaking.</p>
<p>There's just one problem; the weapon in the image that accompanies the email isn't the Airburst… or, indeed, any weapon currently in the game. It's a gun no Helldiver has seen before.</p>

<p>Without spoiling it further here, the weapon doesn't yet exist in-game, leading many people to believe it's either a planned sneaky tease of what's to come, or a mistake. I'll leave you to decide which.</p>

<span data-position="1"></span></p><p>It's the latest in a litany of errors from Sony, starting with the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2-steam-players-will-soon-need-to-link-a-psn-account-and-they-arent-happy">infamous PSN debacle that kicked off earlier this year</a>. At the start of May, Helldivers 2 publisher Sony announced players on Steam would soon be required to link a PlayStation Network (PSN) account to keep playing. This not only resulted in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2s-positive-steam-score-tumbles-as-pc-players-hit-back-at-sonys-psn-requirements">swathes of negative reviews from a very disappointed community</a>, but the game was also <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2-has-been-pulled-from-sale-in-177-countries-as-its-psn-linking-requirement-rolls-out">pulled from sale in 177 countries where PSN was not available</a>, forcing <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-overturns-helldivers-2-psn-requirement-following-backlash">Sony to backtrack on its plans</a>.</p>
<p>Perhaps as a consequence of this, Helldivers 2 – which is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2-now-playstations-fastest-selling-game-ever">PlayStation's fastest-selling game ever</a> – has recently seen its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2-sees-huge-drop-in-player-numbers-since-release">player numbers decline</a>. A look at the game's Steam charts shows a steady drop since February, when the game launched. According to SteamDB, at its peak in February shortly after launch, there were 458,709 concurrent players. In the last 24-hours, the game had a peak of 53.5K players.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2-developer-donates-to-save-the-children-because-players-saved-the-children-in-game-too">Helldivers 2 developer Arrowhead Game Studios recently donated $4311 (£3397) to the Save the Children charity</a> after Helldivers chose morality over manslaughter earlier this week.</p>

            <p>A Polish developer has come under fire for expecting employees to agree to mandatory sauna sessions.</p>
<p>In a now viral LinkedIn exchange, Spectrum Studio creative director Jacek Piórkowski approached narrative designer and writer Aleksandra Wolna about working for his studio. Wolna replied to state Piórkowski had previously approached her about a job, and she had declined as it required her to agree to mandatory and reportedly naked sauna sessions.</p>
<p>"Jacek started a conversation with me under a post about me looking for a job. I did my research on him and his studio and politely declined because of the sauna thing," Wolna told Eurogamer. "I later posted about the situation about All In Games employees that weren't getting paid and are now looking for a job, since I am also owed a lot of money by this company. Suddenly, Jacek appeared offering me a job again."</p>

</figure>
<p>"I reminded him that I declined and told him why, which can be seen on those viral screenshots," Wolna continued. "Jacek then started to convince me and others that there is nothing wrong with what he's expecting of his employees."</p>
<p><a href="https://cdaction.pl/publicystyka/they-werent-paid-but-fired-and-lied-to-ironbird-creations-employee-drama-and-the-crisis-at-all-in-ga">Reportedly</a>, publisher All In Games hasn't paid its employees for half a year, as a result of its "temporary" financial crisis.</p>
<p>Piórkowski has amended a number of his comments on LinkedIn in the time since his initial post to Wolna, but still defends the decision to ask employees to participate in sauna sessions, stating the requirement is in place because it is what the studio's game is about. "I don't want to waste my time to explain what's the difference between Ruska Bania or Dry Sauna. You have to feel it," <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7207509477401538560?commentUrn=urn%3Ali%3Acomment%3A%28activity%3A7207509477401538560%2C7207699590786015232%29&amp;replyUrn=urn%3Ali%3Acomment%3A%28activity%3A7207509477401538560%2C7207797666909499392%29&amp;dashCommentUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_comment%3A%287207699590786015232%2Curn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A7207509477401538560%29&amp;dashReplyUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_comment%3A%287207797666909499392%2Curn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A7207509477401538560%29">Piórkowski</a> wrote.</p>

<p>"Spectrum Studio is working on new groundbreaking game: mix of Life is Strange (Narrative), Final Fantasy (story, characters), Heart of Darkness (adventure levels with dog), The Turyst (exploration and questing) and THPS2 (tricks and specials).</p>
<p>"Main character will be saunamaster and will be in charge of performing in various saunas (smells, music, choreography, everything)."</p>
<p>The studio then lists the position's requirements, and it is here mandatory sauna sessions are specified (there is no mention of nudity here). Spectrum Studio also said it would provide "plannings in sauna, free of charge" within this post.</p>

The developer said the "wetness" level inside certain saunas can get very high, and if someone was using a towel it "may result with fungal infection", which is why there are times participants are recommended to go in nude.</p>

This is something, Piórkowski said, he would not do. "One needs to understand [the] assignment and that one is very specific..." he wrote. <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7207509477401538560?commentUrn=urn%3Ali%3Acomment%3A%28activity%3A7207509477401538560%2C7207699590786015232%29&amp;replyUrn=urn%3Ali%3Acomment%3A%28activity%3A7207509477401538560%2C7207892925576364032%29&amp;dashCommentUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_comment%3A%287207699590786015232%2Curn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A7207509477401538560%29&amp;dashReplyUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_comment%3A%287207892925576364032%2Curn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A7207509477401538560%29">Wolna</a> pointed out there is a big difference between making sure a candidate is suitable for any given job and an employer expecting its staff to be naked during work-related activities.</p>
<p>"You had a lot of time to prove me wrong. To write [a] scene in [a] sauna without being in sauna... Instead, we are wasting time on social media," <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7207509477401538560?commentUrn=urn%3Ali%3Acomment%3A%28activity%3A7207509477401538560%2C7207699590786015232%29&amp;replyUrn=urn%3Ali%3Acomment%3A%28activity%3A7207509477401538560%2C7207898372312076288%29&amp;dashCommentUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_comment%3A%287207699590786015232%2Curn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A7207509477401538560%29&amp;dashReplyUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_comment%3A%287207898372312076288%2Curn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A7207509477401538560%29">Piorkowski</a> replied. "My Narrative girls had to go to [the] sauna with me to come up with [an] amazing script for proof of concept... Technically, it's possible to do it without it, but I absolutely adore the fact that they could use their sauna experience to write awesome scenes."</p>
<p>Piórkowski has now released a full statement regarding Spectrum Studio's sauna mandate. In a video shared on the studio's <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/spectrum-studios-games/">LinkedIn</a> page, he apologised to Wolna. "I didn't intend to embarrass, hurt, offend, or show disrespect towards Ms Wolna. My choice of words was bad. I didn't state my intentions clearly. I didn't explain why taking a sauna is so important and practically essential for me," he said (thank you to Magdalena Kluj for translating).</p>
<p>"I wasn't expecting that it would be received as pretentious and cause negative connotations." He noted his use of "narrative girls" was wrong, and meant only to convey the narrative team at that time was all female.</p>
<p>Piórkowski further spoke of how "passionate" he is about the sauna experience. "In recruiting, I took an iron rule about talking saunas and people's openness to this experience," he stated. "I am looking for people equally passionate about the culture of taking saunas and open to experiences that are part of that culture. I believe that personal experience of a subject helps with understanding the sauna culture."</p>
<p>Piórkowski continued: "I agree that the words I chose could be perceived that it was encouraging to take a sauna session with the company boss; it was not my intention. I proposed and am still proposing candidates to [experience] the sauna session female only and male only, as long it reflects the real sauna experience."</p>
<p>Piórkowski said he will be "more careful with the choice of [his] words in the future to avoid embarrassment and doubts about [his] intentions". He stated he has also started "consulting with an HR specialist regarding this case".</p>
<p>"Once again, I'd like to apologise to Miss Aleksandra," he concluded.</p>
<p>Reflecting on this ordeal, Wolna told Eurogamer she is "a bit regretful that this is the only thing that went viral, while it all started with a post mentioning the recent situation with All In Games employees not getting paid". However, she is "glad the sauna man got called out and the situation started an important discussion about awful recruitment practices". Wolna said she has accepted the apology.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/zelda/24182328/zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-design-change<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="fOxTrA">The biggest shock of Tuesday’s <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24180883/legend-of-zelda-echoes-wisdom-nintendo-switch-release-date"><em>The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</em></a> reveal was, of course, that Princess Zelda <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24181064/legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-nintendo-switch-princess-peach">will be the playable protagonist</a>. The second-biggest shock was that the game exists at all, and that it’s coming out <em>in three months</em>.</p>
<p id="3zwV42">The third-biggest shock took a little longer to register for me, but it’s possibly an even bigger deal: <em>Echoes of Wisdom</em> is a clear indication that Nintendo has turned its back on what you might call traditional Zelda game design for good.</p>
<p id="UR3Ucf">Tradition is deeply important to the Legend of Zelda series. This sequence of games has, over the course of 38 Earth years (and <a href="https://www.polygon.com/zelda/23618362/zelda-timeline-where-what-is-breath-of-the-wild-botw-2-tears-of-the-kingdom-imprisoning-war">millennia on Hyrule</a>), essentially told and retold the same story over and over again. Similarly, its game design has morphed and shifted within strict limits as it observed the time-worn rituals of Zelda.</p>
<p id="oXIqD0">For decades, each game would open up in a gradual, nonlinear, but carefully prescribed way, as the player unlocks new tools that fit like keys into the map’s many locks and uses them to find the solutions to intricate puzzles. In the first review of a Zelda game that I wrote — I think it was for <em>The Minish Cap</em>, in 2004 — I described the games as “clockwork fairy tales,” meaning they worked like beautiful, precision pieces of machinery that the player could slot themselves into. And they stayed that way — until 2017.</p>

<p id="dnXUQm"><em>Breath of the Wild </em>tore up the Zelda rulebook. It gave players all the most important tools at the start of the game and let them explore the map in any direction, tackling its challenges in any order. Through systems like weapon durability, weather, stamina, and cooking, it also added a lot of variables that would keep players on their toes and encourage improvisation.</p>
<p id="LoOczL">Then 2023’s <em>Tears of the Kingdom </em>turbocharged this approach with a handful of abilities that seemed conceived less to disrupt the game design than to break it completely. Ultrahand lets players build their own furniture, buildings, vehicles, and powered contraptions. Fuse splices almost every single object in the game into the weapons system. Rewind lets players send individual objects backward in time. And Ascend — which <a href="https://www.polygon.com/legend-zelda-tears-kingdom/23720221/zelda-totk-tears-kingdom-interview-ascend-ability-botw-2">started life as a debug tool for developers</a> — is almost a literal cheat, a traversal get-out-of-jail-free card.</p>
<p id="TwMtyo">With these two open-world games, <em>Tears of the Kingdom</em> especially, series producer Eiji Aonuma and his team shifted the paradigm of Zelda design toward open-endedness and player creativity (<a href="https://www.polygon.com/legend-zelda-tears-kingdom/24003308/zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-totk-devs-mario-maker">up to a point</a>). These games were enormously popular, but — perhaps because of the accumulated cultural weight of the first three decades of Zelda games — I assumed traditional Zelda would live on beside this new strain, probably in smaller-scale titles harking back to the series’ 2D roots.</p>
<div id="c5tDV8"><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/94RTrH2erPE?rel=0" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share;"></iframe></p></div>
<p id="kYlnrx">It seems not. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=94RTrH2erPE">Introducing <em>Echoes of Wisdom</em></a> in a video, Aonuma laid it on the line: “Here, we wanted to create a new gameplay style that breaks conventions seen in past Legend of Zelda games with a top-down perspective,” he said. Nintendo is not done messing with its beloved franchise — or rather, letting players mess with it, and challenging its designers to keep up with them.</p>
<p id="ibjivb">In the game, Princess Zelda can <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24181059/legend-of-zelda-echoes-wisdom-why-no-sword-gameplay-nintendo-link">use a magic staff</a> called the Tri Rod to create copies of objects, and even monsters, called Echoes. She can build stairs out of bed frames, summon Moblins to fight for her, or create freestanding columns of water. In the video, Aonuma pointed out the way battles or puzzle solutions play out will vary greatly from player to player depending on the Echoes they use. The Echo ability is Princess Zelda’s Ultrahand; just as in <em>Tears of the Kingdom</em>, the ability to <a href="https://www.polygon.com/legend-zelda-tears-kingdom/23723279/totk-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-bridge-totk">brute-force the game’s challenges</a>, or step outside the usual Zelda ruleset to bypass them, is baked into the game design, and part of the fun.</p>
<p id="YNa8zd"><em>Echoes of Wisdom</em> will be the first brand-new Zelda game to come out since Link’s open-world adventures shook the series up. Visually, it looks just like the 2019 remake of the 1993 classic <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/2019/9/19/20870437/zelda-links-awakening-review-nintendo-switch"><em>Link’s Awakening</em></a>, but in design terms it feels like it belongs to this different, newer breed of Zelda games. Embracing creativity and player freedom now appears to be a core tenet of the series. Aonuma’s quiet revolution continues; Zelda will never be the same again. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/minecraft-arrives-on-playstation-5-with-preview-version/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>In a new <a href="https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/minecraft-playstation-5" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">official blog post</a>, Mojang Studios confirmed that a preview is available today for a native version of Minecraft on PlayStation 5.</p>



<p>Players who own the PlayStation 4 version of Minecraft can access the new preview on their PlayStation 5 via “Settings” and “Preview” in-game. </p>



<p>The preview includes the Tricky Trials Update, and it supports multiplayer for PlayStation 4 and 5 consoles. This early version also features cross-play on Realms. Players with a subscription can create a separate preview realm that doesn’t affect their normal creations.</p>



<p>Mojang does warn that preview builds “will likely be unstable,” and invited feedback from fans. Also, the preview version does not have access to the Minecraft Store.</p>



<p>Mojang elaborated on the decision to make a PlayStation 5 version of Minecraft. The devs explained that a native PS5 version will naturally allow the game to “run more effectively on the PS5’s hardware.”</p>



<p>Minecraft Legends just <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/minecraft-legends-is-ending-new-content/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ended new content</a> last January, but the core Minecraft game continues to thrive. In fact, Netflix announced last month that a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/netflix-announces-animated-minecraft-series-is-coming-soon/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Minecraft animated series</a> is “coming soon.” This is in addition to the Minecraft film adaptation, with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/jack-black-minecraft-movie/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jack Black attached</a> to play Steve.</p>



<p>PlayStation recently held a lengthy <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-state-of-play-may-2024-everything-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">State of Play showcase</a>, teasing a variety of titles like Monster Hunter Wilds and a PC version of God of War Ragnarok.</p>

What's more, the fiend even mimics Roach's behaviour by backing Geralt up when not being ridden, and its savage swipes are a touch more effective than a horse kick.</p><p>Only a handful of Fiends exist in The Witcher 3 naturally, and the massive monsters are always a threat. "Fiends are walking mountains of muscle capped with horned, tooth-filled heads," reads the in-game bestiary entry. "When possible they avoid humans, but when not possible, they kill them, and without much difficulty."</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/06/21/tw3-1718968800782.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Mod lets you ride a fiend in The Witcher 3 (Image Credit: apokryphos / Nexus Mods)</figcaption></figure></output><p>The Witcher 3 has enjoyed an influx of creative mods like this thanks to developer CD Projekt Red releasing official modding software for the role-playing game. REDkit is available for free on Steam, the Epic Games Store, and GOG to anyone who owns The Witcher 3 but will remain a PC exclusive despite fellow role-playing game makers <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/25/there-are-already-6-times-more-mods-for-skyrim-special-edition-on-xbox-one-than-ps4">Bethesda bringing mod support to the likes of The Elder Scrolls 5: Skyrim</a> and <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-official-mod-support-arrives-this-september">Larian Studios bringing it to Baldur's Gate 3</a>.</p><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-witcher-3-wild-hunt-getting-official-mod-editor-from-cd-projekt">CD Projekt Red announced REDkit in November 2023</a>, saying "it will allow you to create your own experiences in the game by making something completely new or editing existing quests and content." Fans are still getting to grips with the new tools, and while full expansion-like mods are likely on the way, smaller projects have so far seen the likes of this and <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/get-a-taste-of-the-witcher-remake-with-mod-that-puts-original-games-maps-in-the-witcher-3">a miniature remake of the original Witcher game</a> release.</p><p>Mods will be the only new content coming to The Witcher 3 going forward, of course, as while the game received <a href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/the-witcher-3-wild-hunt/Biggest_Changes_in_the_Next-Gen_Update">a PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X update in December 2022</a>, it otherwise won't get any more official content as <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/every-cd-projekt-red-game-in-development">CD Projekt focuses on its wealth of other incoming projects</a>.</p><p>The highly anticipated next mainline Witcher game, codenamed Polaris, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-witcher-4-polaris-development-cd-projekt">is currently in development</a> but won't arrive until <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-witcher-4-polaris-is-at-least-three-years-away">2025 at the absolute earliest, and probably later</a>. There are two other Witcher games on the horizon too, including <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-witcher-remake-will-be-open-world-cd-projekt-red-confirms">a remake of the original Witcher</a> and <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/witcher-spin-off-project-sirius-has-a-new-framework-following-development-restart">a multiplayer spin-off</a>.</p><p><em>Ryan Dinsdale is an IGN freelance reporter.

For Aloy, her Nendoroid replica is based on her Forbidden West adventures and she comes with three interchangeable face plates to switch up her facial expressions. You also get optional parts like a spear, a bow and arrow, a Focus effect part, and a Watcher miniature figure.</p><p>If you're looking to bulk up that Horizon package with a few more items, you can also check out this more <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/1506725570?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">realistic PVC statue of Aloy from Dark Horse Comics</a> or the two <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Art-Horizon-Forbidden-West/dp/150673202X?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">art books full of incredible illustrations</a>.

                <p>If you follow Hideo Kojima on social media, then you know the legendary game director is quite a big cinephile--and that includes a soft spot for the Paddington franchise. Apparently, the feeling is mutual, as the little Peruvian bear has offered to dine with Kojima over a marmalade sandwich.</p><p>The interaction came after Kojima posted a video of himself opening a promotional package for the upcoming Paddington in Peru movie, which contained a number of goodies--including a jar of Paddington's famous marmalade.</p><p>Marmalade sandwiches, of course, contain all the vitamins and minerals a bear needs for the whole day, though it's unclear if this will be enough sustenance for a 60-year-old human man currently working on multiple video games.</p><p>Though he's best known for being very polite and taking things very literally, Paddington has also <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uyHuq8uk6Ko" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dabbled in tactical operations</a>. This has helped him to put away some of England's most notorious criminals.</p><p>For his next adventure, Paddington is headed back to Peru in the appropriately titled Paddington in Peru. The <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/first-paddington-in-peru-trailer-has-danger-excitement-and-marmalade-sandwiches/1100-6524193/" data-ref-id="1100-6524193">first trailer</a> dropped for the film recently, showing the bear and his adopted family, the Browns, traveling to his birthplace to search for Aunt Lucy. </p><p>Hideo Kojima is currently working on Death Stranding 2: On The Beach, as well as the horror game OD and the espionage game Physint. </p>
