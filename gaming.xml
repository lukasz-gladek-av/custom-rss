            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/littlebigplanet-3-plus-dlc-delisted-halloween<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sony and Sumo Digital have announced that <i>LittleBigPlanet 3</i>, along with the entire currently-available range of&nbsp;<em>LittleBigPlanet&nbsp;</em>DLC, will no longer be available via the PlayStation Store starting later this month.</p>
<p>Per <a href="https://x.com/LittleBigPlanet/status/1843652568389480651" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a post</a> on the official&nbsp;<em>LittleBigPlanet&nbsp;</em>X (formerly Twitter) account,&nbsp;<em>LittleBigPlanet 3&nbsp;</em>and the series DLC will be delisted from the store on October 31st. That's one way to scare&nbsp;<em>LittleBigPlanet&nbsp;</em>fans, I suppose.</p>
<p>Sony says that anyone who owns the game or its DLC will still be able to access those things after the delisting, so this isn't a complete removal. However, you won't be able to purchase the game or any of the DLC being delisted after that date.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/littlebigplanet-3-delisted-dlc.jpg?itok=apRFEsJ4 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/littlebigplanet-3-delisted-dlc.jpg?itok=x0suQEyz 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>LittleBigPlanet 3&nbsp;</em>will be delisted from the PlayStation Store soon.</figcaption></figure><p>As Sony points out, its message is a "friendly reminder" that anyone who has yet to purchase&nbsp;<em>LittleBigPlanet 3&nbsp;</em>or "any&nbsp;<em>LittleBigPlanet&nbsp;</em>DLC currently available for purchase" should do so before October 31st.</p>
<p>Of course, if you own a physical copy of the game, it's not just suddenly going to stop working, so you'll always be able to play it from the disc. However, it won't be available to buy digitally anymore.</p>
<p>Sony doesn't give a reason for the game being delisted, but it's possible that since much of&nbsp;<em>LittleBigPlanet</em>'s DLC revolves around licensed IP such as <i>Metal Gear Solid</i>,&nbsp;<em>Dragon Age</em>, and&nbsp;<em>Doctor Who</em>, those licenses have run out and Sony either won't or can't renew them.</p>
<p>Games are delisted from digital storefronts for a variety of reasons, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/forza-horizon-4-delisting-player-surge">licensing</a> is just one of them; others include <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/postal-3-delisted-on-steam-due-to-drm-problems">DRM issues</a>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hi-rez-delists-paladins-switch-version-due-to-bad-performance">poor performance on certain platforms</a>, and a host of other potential causes.</p>

<p>The delisting of&nbsp;<em>LittleBigPlanet 3&nbsp;</em>means that after October 31st, it will no longer be possible to buy and own a&nbsp;<em>LittleBigPlanet&nbsp;</em>game via a digital PlayStation storefront, which feels like a real blow for preservation.</p>
<p>Thankfully, as long as it's possible to track down pre-owned physical copies of the game, you'll still be able to pick it up from somewhere, and you can still buy&nbsp;<em>LittleBigPlanet 3&nbsp;</em><a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/littlebigplanet-3/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">via the PlayStation Store</a> for now, so if you have any inclination whatsoever to play it, I'd pick it up sooner rather than later.</p>

You’re probably already seeing all kinds of creepy creatures, from black cats to ghosts, in your everyday life, and why should video games be any different? Thank goodness they’re not, especially if you’re a <em>Final Fantasy XIV </em>player. Square Enix’s MMO offers the Black Coeurl (a black cat) and Mama Automaton (basically a ghost) for players to acquire when joining in the scary festivities.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195519" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="I Didn’t Play Final Fantasy XVI ‘Right,’ And That’s OK" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="148" data-playlist="195519,196452,195905" data-current="195519"><div><p>I Didn’t Play Final Fantasy XVI ‘Right,’ And That’s OK</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195519/195519_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195519/195519_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195519/195519_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195519/195519_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21013.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><h2 id="h390"><a id=""></a><strong>How to Obtain the Black Coeurl and Mama Automaton</strong></h2><p>The nice thing about these monstrous minions is that the method for obtaining both the Black Coeurl and Mama Automaton are the same.

That’s because ghosts are exactly 50 percent better than cats.</p><p>Once you have enough of the area’s currency, simply go to the main area of the park. At the front desk, there will be an attendant with the title “Gold Saucer Attendant ”. Speak to him and select the third option (“Prize Exchange III”), where you will see both of the critters available for purchase. Note that they will not show up in your Minion Guide automatically after you buy them—you will need to go into your inventory and “use” the newly acquired item before they are added to the list of available minions.</p><h2 id="h391"><a id=""></a><strong>What is MGP and How Do I Get It?</strong></h2><figure id="" data-id="c0f9224f35688c0efd1523da7614d130" data-recommend-id="image://c0f9224f35688c0efd1523da7614d130" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The cat menu and oh good grief this game looks a mess." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The cat menu and oh good grief this game looks a mess." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Square Enix / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="c0f9224f35688c0efd1523da7614d130" data-recommend-id="image://c0f9224f35688c0efd1523da7614d130" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The cat menu and oh good grief this game looks a mess." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>MGP is obtained by participating in different activities around the Gold Saucer. The most lucrative method is to participate in GATEs which occur every 20 minutes at the 20, 40 and 60 minute marks. Depending on your performance, up to 4,000 MGP can be awarded during these events, so even if you do well, it will take completing a handful to get enough points to afford one of the minions, perhaps even both.</p><p>Another couple of easy options are buying Cactpot Tickets, of which there are two kinds. There is a small lottery—basically a scratcher—that can be purchased up to three times daily, and a jumbo lottery where you can purchase three tickets weekly with the winning numbers being drawn every Saturday. Since players can use MGP to purchase up to three tickets per drawing, this can be a simple and effective way to farm MGP with little effort on your part.</p><figure id="" data-id="330ea83db626fc42c994307243a7d0c9" data-recommend-id="image://330ea83db626fc42c994307243a7d0c9" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A visual migraine in gaming form." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A visual migraine in gaming form." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Square Enix / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="330ea83db626fc42c994307243a7d0c9" data-recommend-id="image://330ea83db626fc42c994307243a7d0c9" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A visual migraine in gaming form." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>It may seem counterintuitive to spend currency when you are trying to save up for a specific prize, but the great thing about the Cactpot lotteries is even if you don’t win the jackpot, you will receive a consolation prize, the amount received almost always being greater than what you spent on the actual ticket. Which is a terrible way to run a lottery. As an added bonus, the daily tickets are actually fairly easy to win, and if you are playing three times every day, you should have no problem getting a winning ticket several times a week—that’ll net you 10,000 MGP per win!</p><p>Decorating in <em>Final Fantasy XIV</em> is just as fun as in real life, so take advantage of this opportunity to get into the Halloween spirit. Or, if you are reading this too late, know that these prizes are available year round, so you can pick them up now, show your love of black cats and ghosts independently of the festivities, and be ready for when the ghoulies return next year.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>"This is an incredibly difficult time, and our focus is to provide the support and guidance to those affected."</p>
<p>It's unclear exactly how many staff members are affected, or in which roles.</p>
<p>Tequila Works, based in Madrid, is best known as the developer of 2017's Rime, a beautiful puzzle game about a young boy lost on an island. That same year it co-developed and published The Sexy Brutale.</p>
<p>Since then, it released Stadia-exclusive Gylt in 2019, which made its way to consoles and PC shortly after that platform's shutdown.</p>
<p>Its most recent game was Song of Nunu: A <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/league-of-legends">League of Legends</a> Story, released under the Riot Forge label that shut down earlier this year.</p>
<p>Still, as the studio wrote in its post, it's now working on just one game, which can hopefully avoid the bad luck of recent releases.</p>
<p>Layoffs across the games industry in 2024 are now <a href="https://publish.obsidian.md/vg-layoffs/Archive/2024">estimated</a> to be at over 13,000.</p>
<p>Last month, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-lays-off-further-650-xbox-staff-no-games-cancelled-or-studios-closed">Microsoft laid off 650 staff</a>, in addition to 1900 earlier in 2024. Sony laid off 900 staff back in February, followed by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/destiny-developer-bungie-lays-off-220-staff-roughly-17-percent-of-workforce">220 staff at Bungie</a> in July.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/08/enotria-the-last-song-review/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>Confession time: I have never played Dark Souls. Nor have I played any of its immediate kin. So, no Elden Ring, no Bloodborne, not even Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice. My excuse is that, upon Dark Souls release, I was taking an enforced leave of absence from video games, so I missed all that initial buzz. And then, when I came back to the warm loving embrace of video gamedom, the thought of spending hours trying to beat just one boss kept me far away from the Souls-like phenomenon. How then, I wondered as Enotria: The Last Song booted up, would I get on with the latest entry in the bloated Souls-like genre?</p>
<p><iframe title="Enotria: The Last Song - Gamescom 2024 Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3IO29PB62fI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Enotria stands out from its many Souls-like siblings in two ways. The first is its colour pallet. The aesthetic of Enotria is resoundingly light and bright. The action takes place beneath glorious azure skies, amongst scores of golden, gleaming sunflowers, through white-washed villas, and across resplendent sandy beaches. It’s a far cry from the dark, dank, and gloomy look usually associated with the genre.</p>


<p>The second way Enotria emerges from the pack is with its setting of Italian mythology. Like all brilliant mythologies, Italian folklore is totally bonkers and completely inaccessible and incomprehensible to those not already immersed in it. I couldn’t make head nor tail of the story, nor did I understand what was occurring with the characters at any given point. But when the world you’ve created is this wonderfully over-the-top, you can’t help but be carried away by the wilful insanity of it all. What I can tell you is that it involved the stage, acting, singing, lots of masks, and very big hats.</p>


<p>In comparison to its look and world building, when it comes to gameplay, Enotria is more traditional. Your silent protagonist explores, fights bosses, gathers weapons and equipment, discovers save points, and dies. A lot. To a Souls-like newbie like me, it’s all a bit much. There are so many systems, so many intricacies, that developers Jyamma Games clearly didn’t know where to even begin with communicating it all to the player. The tutorial is a near-endless stream of pop-up text boxes explaining everything and anything. You can barely move for the first hour of the game without another very long lump of text telling you in excruciating detail about whatever it is you just tried to do. Clearly., it’s very much a case of tell, don’t show.</p>
<p>As such, it takes a long time for Enotria to get going and find its feet. But slowly – very very slowly – the systems start to reveal themselves. Rather than different player characters, you can equip and wear masks to power your avatar with new abilities and skills. You can generously switch between several of these masks on a whim, giving ample opportunity to change up your play and discover some impressively long attack combos in the process. It’s a revelation, providing the opportunity to wipe out even the most tenacious of bosses with a devastating and lengthy series of strikes. Elemental attacks are also unusually interesting. Rather than the usual fire or ice ho-hum, how about imbuing your foe with drunkenness? Now that’s much more fun.</p>

<p>Whilst you can equip hundreds of different weapons, the fact is that a handful will be your go-to choice; offering everything you need to progress. Dodging is the name of the game here, which works well enough, though the attacks themselves lack a sense of impact and contact to truly thrill a player. Combat feels exactly as you’d expect, which is, in this context, completely fine.</p>
<p>Enotria really lets itself down when it comes to the jank. Locking on to foes is fiddly and forced. While the game struggles with characters trying to fight each other on different height levels, it just doesn’t like it and refuses to play. It’s a real problem when your foes seem obsessed with finding themselves stranded on small boulders, totally confused. In fact, enemy AI is generally dumb, and that’s being generous. I encountered issues with controller inputs too, the game choosing to stack up moves and do them all in one go, rather than when I tapped the button. A good patch or seven will definitely be required to smooth out the overall experience.</p>

<p>As revealed in <a href="https://www.rockstargames.com/newswire/article/o3314a19koo147/red-dead-redemption-and-undead-nightmare-coming-to-pc-october-29" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a news post</a> on Rockstar's official website,&nbsp;<em>Red Dead Redemption&nbsp;</em>comes to PC on October 28th, and just like the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/red-dead-redemption-ps4-switch-port">PS4 and Switch releases</a> that landed last year, the PC release will include the&nbsp;<em>Undead Nightmare&nbsp;</em>expansion as well.</p>
<p>Murmurs have been circulating about the PC release of&nbsp;<em>Red Dead Redemption&nbsp;</em>for some time now, but the strongest evidence yet for the port's existence came in August, when a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/red-dead-redemption-pc-port-seemingly-leaked">since-deleted PlayStation Store listing</a> all but confirmed the PC version.</p>

<p>It'll include many of the usual PC enhancements you'd expect from a port like this, including native 4K, support for up to 144Hz refresh rates, and support for both ultrawide and super ultrawide monitors, as well as keyboard and mouse support.</p>
<p>You can also look forward to support for Nvidia DLSS 3.7 and AMD FSR 3.0, as well as a host of graphical settings that should make it possible to enjoy&nbsp;<em>Red Dead Redemption&nbsp;</em>no matter what kind of machine you have (assuming it isn't an actual potato, of course).</p>

<p><em>Red Dead Redemption&nbsp;</em>originally launched all the way back in 2010 for PS3 and Xbox 360, followed by <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/red-dead-redemption-2">a sequel</a>,&nbsp;<em>Red Dead Redemption 2</em>, in 2018. Believe it or not, this will be the first time the original&nbsp;<em>Red Dead Redemption&nbsp;</em>has ever been available on PC.</p>
<p>You'll be able to grab&nbsp;<em>Red Dead Redemption&nbsp;</em>on PC via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2668510/Red_Dead_Redemption/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam</a>, the Epic Games Store, and the Rockstar Launcher on October 28th.</p>

One of the games industry's worst-kept secrets, the PC version of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/red-dead-redemption">Red Dead Redemption</a>, is a worst-kept secret no longer. After an <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rockstar-leak-more-clues-of-a-red-dead-redemption-pc-remaster">unconscionable period of leakage</a>, Rockstar have at last confirmed the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-open-world-games">open world</a> port, together with a PC version of its Undead Nightmare expansion - they're coming to Rockstar Store, Steam and the Epic Games Store on October 29th 2024. Picture craggy old John Marston riding into town at sunset, whooping and firing six-shooters at the clouds. Actually, don't picture anything - that's what videos are for!

<p>You'll be able to buy both Red Dead Redemption and Undead Nightmare as one package, with a bunch of PC-specific features and tune-ups, including the below: 
</p>
<blockquote><p>
    Native 4K resolution and beyond at up to 144hz on supported hardware
</p>
<p>
    Monitor support for both Ultrawide (21:9) and Super Ultrawide (32:9)
</p>
<p>
    Full keyboard and mouse support
</p>
<p>
    Upscaling technologies support for Nvidia DLSS 3.7 and AMD FSR 3.0
</p>
<p>
    Nvidia DLSS Frame Generation
</p>
<p>
    Adjustable draw distances, shadow quality settings, and more 
</p></blockquote>
<p>
One thing the press release doesn't mention is multiplayer. The console game allowed up to 16 barking buckeroos to roam a version of the single player world. I remember having great fun with a preview build on Xbox 360, engaging in Mexican stand-offs and getting knocked off my horse. But what I mostly recall, and cherish, about Red Dead Redemption is how wonderfully buggy it was at launch. Here's another, funnier video.

That's all there is to say, at this point. I'm not sure I'm desperate to play the original RDR again, with Red Dead Redemption 2 <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/red-dead-redemption-2-pc-review">already available on PC</a>, but if you're an avid Rockstar-gazer, it's something to fill the void between now and the release of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gta-6-everything-we-know">GTA 6</a>.

		<p>Rockstar Games has announced that the original Red Dead Redemption is finally coming to PC this month on 29th October. The game will be available via Steam, Epic and the Rockstar Store, bundling the main game together with the Undead Nightmare for some perfectly timed zombie-horror action on Halloween.</p>
<p><iframe title="Red Dead Redemption and Undead Nightmare Coming to PC October 29" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mnvc6uC6xZE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Red Dead Redemption’s port has been handled by Double Eleven – Rockstar themselves are <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/05/17/gta-6-targets-late-2025-release-date-as-take-two-narrows-launch-window/">kind of busy</a> – with the studio working in some PC-specific enhancements to the game, including support for native 4K at up to 144Hz, Ultrawide (21:9) and Super Ultrawide (32:9) screen support, HDR10, and keyboard and mouse support.</p>
<p>Even though the game is 14 years old, you might like to have some graphics settings on PC, and so there’s things like adjustable draw distances, shadow quality settings and more. You’ve also got Nvidia DLSS 3.7 (with frame generation), and AMD FSR 3.0 for upscaling.</p>
<p>Red Dead Redemption’s PC port has been rumoured for as long as it’s been overdue, and even leaked on <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/06/15/red-dead-redemption-pc-version-leaks-again/">a couple</a> <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/13/red-dead-redemption-for-pc-leaked-by-the-playstation-store/">occasions</a>. Originally launching for PS3 and Xbox 360 in 2010, it was a part of the last wave of Rockstar games that came out before GTA V saw all the global studios combine their efforts. Rockstar San Diego’s work was a big hit, though, and led to the 2018 prequel Red Dead Redemption 2.</p>

<p>Being stuck on Xbox 360 and PS3, the game remained playable on modern platforms for a good long while only thanks to the Xbox One backward compatibility program. However, it’s now enjoying a renaissance with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/08/07/red-dead-redemption-announced-for-switch-and-ps4/">a Nintendo Switch and PS4 port</a> coming along last year, the latter version <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/10/04/red-dead-redemption-patched-to-run-at-60fps-on-ps5/">eventually patched to enable 60FPS gameplay on PS5</a>.</p>
<p>In our original <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2010/05/19/review-red-dead-redemption/">Red Dead Redemption review</a> we scored the game a masterful 10/10, saying:</p>
<p>“Rockstar San Diego’s latest title is an unmissable game for any fan of the genre or great action adventures in general. We don’t often get masterpieces around here, but this is certainly one of those moments in time when gamers will look back more fondly on a dusty old six shooter than anything that involves jacking cars. The Wild West, then, is the new New York, and Rockstar have got their work cut out for them if they want Grand Theft Auto V to come anywhere near close to the majesty of Red Dead Redemption. A job we don’t envy.”</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/infinity-nikki-reaches-20-million-pre-registrations/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>A fully-fledged game is being made of the Nikki series, with this being the fifth installment in the franchise. Infinity Nikki is an upcoming RPG with an <a href="https://wccftech.com/infinity-nikki-announced-zelda-botw-designer-producing/">expansive open world</a> where players get to explore the platform and unlock new clothing to dress up Nikki and her cat, Momo. While the game doesn't have an official release yet, those excited about the dress-up game are able to pre-register for the game, which will give them access to pre-registration rewards and news once the game is officially released. Back in August 2024, Infinity Nikki had officially reached 12 million pre-registrations. Currently, <a href="https://infinitynikki.infoldgames.com/en/home" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the game is sitting at 21,268,111 global pre-registrations</a> for the upcoming gacha game. Hitting 20 million pre-registrations globally is just a little way off of the next milestone for Infinity Nikki, with them aiming to get to 25 million pre-registrations at the least. By reaching this number, those who have pre-registered will get the fated rewards that are mentioned on the Infinity Nikki website.</p>
<p>The gacha game genre is already heavily saturated, with games like Genshin Impact, Honkai: Star Rail, and Zenless Zone Zero taking the top spots. Love Nikki-Dress UP Queen is one of the longest standing mobile gacha games in the Nikki series, and it's possible that Infinity Nikki will compete with games such as Genshin Impact when it comes out.</p>
<p>At the moment, Infinity Nikki doesn't have an official release date, but there are plenty of playtests taking place at the moment, with some of those who had pre-registered being able to participate. It has been confirmed by the developers that those who participate in the playtest will not be able to save their data, as it will be wiped after the playtest is concluded.</p>
<p>Infinity Nikki is set to release on iOS, Android, PlayStation 5 and PC via the Epic Games Store. It's unsaid at the moment whether this game will release on Xbox Series X|S in the future, or whether those who want to play it will have to resort to playing it on their phone instead.</p>
<p>Papergames is developing Infinity Nikki, which is the same company that is responsible for making all of the other Nikki games, such as Love Nikki and Shining Nikki. Players who join the 20 million pre-registrations globally will be able to get rewards such as Bling, Threads of Purity, Resonite Crystals and a 4-star outfit for when they sign up to the game, giving them some extra resources for when this Unreal Engine 5 game releases.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, it is not the full-fledged remake powered by the Red Dead Redemption 2 engine that many fans had hoped for. While PC gamers have been waiting to play this installment for a very long time, there were ways to do that via emulators for PlayStation 3, Xbox 360, Nintendo Switch, and even <a href="https://wccftech.com/shadps4-red-dead-redemption-playable/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PlayStation 4</a>. Whether the unique PC features will be enough to entice many users remains to be seen.</p>

<p>Still, there's a chance modders may modernize the game's visuals in a number of ways, from texture packs to character model tweaks to the various ray traced ReShade mods. Rockstar Games has not shared pricing details yet for the PC version of Red Dead Redemption; as a reference point, the game is priced at $49.99 on consoles.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-until-dawn-remake-apparently-has-a-lower-ps5-player-count-than-concord.1003668/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/until-dawn-remake-ps5-player-count-concord<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Remember&nbsp;<em>Concord</em>, the live-service disaster that limped out of the gate to a tiny player count and then was shut down just two weeks later? Well, the new&nbsp;<em>Until Dawn&nbsp;</em>remake apparently has a lower player count than Firewalk's game on PS5.</p>
<p>Said <i>Until Dawn&nbsp;</i>remake <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/until-dawn-remake-release-date">launched just a few days ago</a>, and per a report by <a href="https://www.truetrophies.com/news/until-dawn-ps5-player-count" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PlayStation trophy site TrueTrophies</a> (which, in turn, cites data from GameInsights), its player count was 28.6% lower than that of&nbsp;<em>Concord&nbsp;</em>on Sony's console.</p>
<p>As a reminder,&nbsp;<em>Concord&nbsp;</em>performed so badly at launch that it was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/concord-shutting-down-refunds">shut down in early September</a>, with all players who bought it being offered full refunds. This, incidentally, caused some <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/concord-trophy-hunters-rivalry">pretty amusing trophy-hunting behavior</a> in the game's dying days.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/until-dawn-remake-ps5-player-count-characters.jpg?itok=bm0BD_G0 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/until-dawn-remake-ps5-player-count-characters.jpg?itok=xGAOx-j9 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Until Dawn&nbsp;</em>has apparently underperformed on PS5.</figcaption></figure><p>A couple of things are worth noting here. First, we don't know exactly how Sony was hoping the&nbsp;<em>Until Dawn&nbsp;</em>remake would perform (although we can guess that the company probably had higher hopes for its game than this).</p>
<p>Secondly,&nbsp;<em>Until Dawn&nbsp;</em>does have a much higher <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2172010/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">all-time Steam player count</a> than&nbsp;<em>Concord&nbsp;</em>achieved, with a peak of 2,607 on launch day as compared to&nbsp;<em>Concord</em>'s <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2443720/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">measly 697</a>.</p>
<p><em>Until Dawn&nbsp;</em>is also a single-player game as opposed to&nbsp;<em>Concord</em>'s live-service slant, so its lower player count won't hurt it anywhere near as much as&nbsp;<em>Concord</em>'s did, and there's a chance that sales will slowly grow as well.</p>
<p>However, critical reception for the game has been <a href="https://opencritic.com/game/17416/until-dawn-2024-" rel="noopener" target="_blank">decidedly mixed</a>, with many questioning the need for its existence at all given that the original is only nine years old, as well as criticizing performance and visual issues.</p>

<p>So, why haven't more people picked up&nbsp;<em>Until Dawn&nbsp;</em>on PS5? TrueTrophies reckons it's because of a lack of marketing and promotion, as well as the chance that customers are baulking at the high asking price for what they may see as nothing more than a minor visual upgrade.</p>
<p>Frankly, the decision to remake&nbsp;<em>Until Dawn&nbsp;</em>at all is a baffling one to me. The original is still widely available on PS4, after all (although that <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/horizon-zero-dawn-remastered-esrb">isn't stopping</a> Sony <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/last-of-us-part-2-remastered-leaked-and-releasing-for-ps5-in-january">elsewhere</a>), and it's not like the 2015 game looks ugly or plays horribly compared to the original.</p>
<p>In any case, you can check out the&nbsp;<em>Until Dawn&nbsp;</em>remake right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2172010/Until_Dawn/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC</a> and <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/until-dawn/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>.

Between the 1460s and 1480s, the printing press went from a local business to something found across Germany, eventually spreading Western Europe-wide come 1500. This coincided with burgeoning religious turmoil during the rise of proto-Protestantism, the prelude to the Reformation, creating a threat to the Catholic rule with the dissemination of anti-authority publications suddenly more viable.</p><figure id="" data-id="205906dfd4025c40276fc1dc61808685" data-recommend-id="image://205906dfd4025c40276fc1dc61808685" data-format="jpg" data-width="455" data-height="365" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Malleus Maleficarum's inside text, with notes." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Malleus Maleficarum's inside text, with notes." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Public Domain</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="205906dfd4025c40276fc1dc61808685" data-recommend-id="image://205906dfd4025c40276fc1dc61808685" data-format="jpg" data-width="455" data-height="365" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Malleus Maleficarum's inside text, with notes." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>In 1486, a German Catholic clergyman and sexual pervert called Heinrich Kramer wrote a book called <em>Malleus Maleficarum</em>. It was a deranged and conspiratorial collection of gibberish about demons and witches, a compendium of superstitions that had built up over the last century in Europe, and a book that suggested the only solution for all of these issues was torture and murder.<br></p><p>A few years earlier, <em>Malleus Maleficarum </em>might have been copied out a few times and shared among the local clergy, and—along with Kramer’s prolific preaching—presumably inflicted a lot of harm on those in Innsbruck and the surrounding areas. But instead the book appeared at the convergence of multiple factors, given the country in which it was written, and the religious unrest that was occurring all across Europe, and the contemporaneous establishment of a means of mass-producing books. <em>Malleus Maleficarum</em>, thanks to this serendipitous confluence, went on to become a phenomenon,  its renown spreading through the 16th century. And despite the initial cries of heresy from both within and without the Inquisition, the book ignited a widespread moral panic in both the church and the public, focusing broad fears about the dangers of witchcraft, and introducing the need to torture and kill all who were suspected.</p><div><h4>Buried Treasure</h4><p>  <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://buried-treasure.org/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://buried-treasure.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Buried Treasure</em></a></span><em> is a site that hunts for excellent unknown games that aren’t getting noticed elsewhere.

Only six people remain in the village, and you must speak to them all to hear their accusations and defences, and after five days, identify who should be hanged for witchcraft.</p><p>This is an astonishing game, presented in a combination of scratchy, white-on-black drawings and hauntingly brilliant stop-motion animations, and written in old Scots English. There are four days of play, in which you speak to each of the locals to hear their beliefs and protestations and, should you want to hear more information, make use of the nonchalantly included option to crudely torture them. When you’ve unearthed four new pieces of information, night falls, and you have a prophetic stop-motion nightmare to guide you in your decisions. Normal stuff.</p><p>It’s worth noting that the game begins with a message explaining that it’s intended to be played in old Scots English, and while there’s an in-game glossary if needed, it also offers a version in modern English. If English is your first language, you don’t need the latter, believe me—it’s all easily understood, or inferred, and adds a great deal to the whole atmosphere of the game. </p><figure id="" data-id="e508f31c97508e2174a82cd7c9d1f704" data-recommend-id="image://e508f31c97508e2174a82cd7c9d1f704" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A woman sits at the center of a spiral of stones." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A woman sits at the center of a spiral of stones." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Katanalevy / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="e508f31c97508e2174a82cd7c9d1f704" data-recommend-id="image://e508f31c97508e2174a82cd7c9d1f704" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A woman sits at the center of a spiral of stones." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Among the villagers, there’s Maiden Lilias, who spends her time in the Ring O Stanes, a stone circle that the local priest believes is the site at which she kills babies. She, however, maintains that she’s an herbalist, like her mother before her, at the stones to meet her lover who is missing. Then there’s Blacksmith Oswain, in the Smiths Abode, whose jaw is held on by a wire cage after what he claims was a curse by the Shepherd Violet. She instead accuses Oswain of releasing a wolf among her flock, killing her sheep and her livelihood. Accusations fly.<br></p><p>I wondered if it might be possible to finish the game without using the “torture” option, given that didn’t seem a comfortable pick when the other choice was “Talk.” I’m not one prone to choosing to torture, as it happens. However, it is not, and that’s rather brilliant it turns out, given the unconscionably matter-of-fact tone the witch hunter, and in turn the game, takes throughout. Tortures play out as grotesque minigames, where you pull at a person’s tongue until it tears, or time mouse clicks to squeeze a person’s fingers until they’re crushed. They’re disgusting little things, like twisted versions of a golf game’s timed swings, that may cause a character to reveal information they were holding back, or even to confess.</p><p>There’s no joy in this. But there’s no expressed revulsion, either. It’s coldly delivered by the witchfinder, albeit with accompanying screams from his victims. It matches the aesthetic decision to have the stop-motion characters all appear with blank space where their faces should be—this is a game that entirely trusts <em>you </em>to have appropriate reactions to unjust horror, rather than needing to demonstrate it to you.</p><figure id="" data-id="289447ff30d5b97963d53e813c7b7fc4" data-recommend-id="image://289447ff30d5b97963d53e813c7b7fc4" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The witchfinder talks to another resident, in front of his cart." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The witchfinder talks to another resident, in front of his cart." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Katanalevy / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="289447ff30d5b97963d53e813c7b7fc4" data-recommend-id="image://289447ff30d5b97963d53e813c7b7fc4" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The witchfinder talks to another resident, in front of his cart." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Then, come the fifth day, you make your accusation and that person—again in the incredible, black-and-white stop-motion film—is hanged. And you leave.<br></p><p>This coldness is what makes <em>Daemonologie </em>so brilliant.

And there’s the small matter of those unnerving, sometimes horrifying stop-motion nightmares. This is all the work of one guy, Chris Evry, a passion project made in his spare time, sold for only $3.</p><hr><p><em>Daemonologie </em>achieves so much more than it otherwise might thanks to its brevity and its lack of an attempt to preach or proselytise.

<p>“For the first time in its storied legacy, John Marston’s beloved journey can be experienced on PC in stunning, new detail, with both&nbsp;<strong>Red </strong>Dead Redemption&nbsp;and its iconic zombie-horror companion story,&nbsp;Undead Nightmare, arriving to PC on October 29,” Rockstar said.</p>



<p>The release on PC comes with PC-specific enhancements for players. Those updates include native 4K resolution at 144Hz, Ultrawide and Super Ultrawide support, HDR10, and full mouse and keyboard functionality. There will also be support for AMD FSR 3.0 and Nvidia DLSS 3.7 and DLSS Frame Generation.</p>



<p>The game will be available on Steam, Epic Games Story, and the Rockstar Store. The game is also available on PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and Nintendo Switch.</p>



<h2 id="h-the-release-isn-t-unexpected">The Release Isn’t Unexpected</h2>



<p>The announcement of Red Dead Redemption on PC comes as no surprise. There had been rumors, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/red-dead-redemption-pc-release-possible/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">teases</a>, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/red-dead-redemption-could-coming-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">other signs</a> signaling that the release could happen. The most telling one was when <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/red-dead-redemption-pc-metadata/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">metadata for the game</a> was found in a recent launcher update. Now, three weeks later, the reveal is official.</p>



<p>As far as the future of the series is concerned, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/rdr3-in-development-claim/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rumors have claimed</a> that Red Dead Redemption 3 is in the works at Rockstar. It was also said by the actor who plays Arthur Morgan, Roger Clark, that he <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/red-dead-redemption-3-is-likely-says-lead-role-actor/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">believes a third game</a> is the plan. Right now, however, the focus of Rockstar Games is the development of Grand Theft Auto 5, which is scheduled to release in 2025.</p>

At the time <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/2208920/discussions/0/3542672490614781076/?ctp=126" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ubisoft simply said Valhalla didn’t support Steam Achievements</a>, and left it at that.</p><p>Now, two years later, Ubisoft has updated Assassin’s Creed Valhalla to finally add Steam Achievements. The update, visible via <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2208920/history/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">SteamDB</a> but not yet live in-game, has already sparked a positive reaction from players. “Is old Ubisoft coming back?” <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/2208920/discussions/0/4845401230253610902/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wondered one player on the Steam forum</a>.

In June, Paradox scrapped </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Life by You</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/paradox-shuts-tectonic-studio-and-cancels-life-by-you">shuttered developer Paradox Tectonic</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, resulting in a write down of roughly $20 million.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Prior to that, it said </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The Lamplighters League</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/paradox-writes-off-i-the-lamplighters-league-i-as-commercial-failure">failed to meet sales expectations</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and parted ways with developer Harebrained Schemes shortly after launch. Highly anticipated sequel </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Cities Skylines II</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> also floundered at launch due to a </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/paradox-sets-new-revenue-record-says-it-needs-to-address-quality-issues">number of performance issues</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> that left players reeling. Paradox's attempts to rehabilitate the title alongside developer Colossal Order also </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/production/the-rushed-attempt-to-rehabilitate-cities-skylines-ii-is-becoming-a-cautionary-tale">proved challenging</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Speaking to Game Developer about how Paradox intends to course correct and why its production efforts have stalled, deputy CEO Mattias Lilja and chief creative officer Henrik Fåhraeuz say the company perhaps took too many risks after becoming a victim of its own success.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"We had a period a couple of years ago where we invested a lot of money—and quite a lot of it into [projects] we were not very used to doing," says Lilja when asked where it all started going wrong. "We had this idea that we could go fairly big early on and still be successful. I think we've been proven wrong on several of those counts."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Lilja feels Paradox was bitten by the "curse of success," which resulted in the studio taking risks on projects well outside of its comfort zone.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"I think in some sense we grew fast because we were successful and we wanted to try things. We wanted to experiment and we had cash on hand. We were probably a bit undisciplined in some of our decisions early on, especially in trusting that a larger team would mean less risk [...] rather than realizing that it's the opposite. Smaller teams are better."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">He claims there wasn't a sense of "pressure" surrounding those moves because Paradox hadn't borrowed money to finance its projects. "We ran with good profits," adds Lilja, before acknowledging that enabled the company to take some "unnecessary risks."</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Paradox says ">Paradox says <span>Life by You</span> was scrapped because it wouldn't have dethroned <span>The Sims 4</span></h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">When those risks didn't pay off, Paradox began making cuts. As we mentioned earlier, ambitious life simulator </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Life by You</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and developer Paradox Tectonic were&nbsp;placed on the chopping block in June, but Lilja reiterates the decision to torch both project and studio wasn't made lightly.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Expanding on why the project was kicked to the curb, Paradox chief creative officer Henrik Fåhraeuz explains "key issues" started to rear their head early on.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The company wasn't impressed with how the project looked, and felt graphical improvements were an absolute must. Fåhraeuz recalls thinking "we can't release with characters looking like this" when seeing an early iteration of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Life by You</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, but that wasn't the only area of concern.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"There were a lot of other issues identified," he says, noting how gameplay also lacked flavor, "but we tended to look at each issue and how much progress had been made in that [specific] area, so I think we got blind to the big picture in terms of what the gameplay was like really and how it would stand up to [competitors] like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The Sims 4"</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Fåhraeuz says Paradox asked itself whether </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The Sims 4 </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">players would be "satisfied" with any of the features in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Life by You</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. The brutal answer was 'no.'</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"It didn't shine in any particular area. It wasn't really better than</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span> The Sims 4</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> in any way. You can talk about customization options and so on, which are great, but they're not really gameplay. Even though it was planned to be an early access game—I think with early access you need to release something that is actually very, very fun and quite polished," he adds.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"It can be thin in terms of content and late game options, but it needs to be really fun to begin with and we were far from that point unfortunately." Lilja agrees there were "many issues" with the project, and notes Paradox conducted extensive peer reviews with subject matter experts before eventually pulling the plug.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As for those titles Paradox did bring to market, Lilja explains </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The Lamplighters League</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> was met with positive reviews but struggled to "meet a player fantasy" in order to keep them engaged. He adds that developer Harebrained Schemes wanted to continue making similar titles, while Paradox had no intention of doubling down. As a result, he says it was "logical" for the two to </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/harebrained-schemes-splits-off-from-paradox-will-be-independent-again-in-2024">part ways</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Weighing in on the contentious launch of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Cities Skylines II</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, Lilja concedes the project "had issues that should not have been in the game at release." The current plan is to avoid commercializing the title while Colossal Order stabilizes the project.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">He feels the game is in a "pretty good place" at the moment, but says the dev team are treading carefully when it comes to rolling out updates. Why, though, did Paradox and Colossal Order release such a high-profile project before it was ready? Lilja says both companies had agreed it was time to launch—but only if they emphasized players would need to meet high system requirements. That was a mistake.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"What we missed—which is absolutely on our end as publishers—is there were certain combinations of higher-level performance hardware that did not work [with the game]. That's really bad," says Lilja.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"I think Henrik can probably talk about the value of player feedback and going to market as early as you can, because a game is a painting in a sense. When is the painting done? Well, when you stop painting it—and you get feedback on it.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"The game needs to be good enough. The key features need to be good enough. Then we can work on the game for a long time. We misunderstood that by quite a wide margin on </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Cities Skylines II</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. Fortunately, now we're trying to work with the fans to fix it. I would also argue that since [the project] is closer to our core, as a failure, it wasn't catastrophic. I'm not saying it didn't have problems. Im saying we're in a position where we can fix it."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Fåhraeuz states Paradox is in the habit of making games for the "long haul," which is perhaps why some of the studio's recent fumbles have surprised onlookers. He states that developing video games with longevity in mind requires deep collaboration with players, and says Paradox will be looking to start those conversations much earlier as it moves forward.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"The trick is to bring players in earlier, perhaps even before release," he says. "We do that a lot with our DLCs and major patches, because you can have an open beta branch on Steam. We used to be quite good at it actually, because we used to run huge closed beta testa and had dedicated fans coming in much earlier. Somehow we haven't done this correctly recently, and we need to get back to bring really good at that."</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Smaller titles and extensive prototyping will be key to Paradox rebuild">Smaller titles and extensive prototyping will be key to Paradox rebuild</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Fåhraeuz says those costly slip-ups are the result of Paradox losing its "knowledge share." He also believes the company needs to get much better at prototyping projects. "Pre-production needs to be longer and better executed, honestly, because it's much better to fail early than late," adds Fåhraeuz. "In terms of the teams, they'll probably survive such a scenario because they can move on to another idea instead."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Lilja feels the company's predicament is also the result of "overconfidence," and wonders if Paradox has forgotten "what is really hard [about making games]" after years of success. Both agree a reset is needed.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Paradox now intends to focus on smaller projects that fit nearly into its portfolio. "[We'll be] starting smaller, investing not as much," says Lilja. "If there are a lot of people on [a project] it's hard to move them. A large team is probably not the most efficient if you have issues with the core of a game. It's hard to move them.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"So, starting small so you don't have so much of an impact when you realize that you're heading in the wrong direction. You also have time to review [those projects], so that's what we're trying to do now."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">By pursuing projects that are more familiar, Lilja believes Paradox will be able to more effectively predict how they'll shape up. He notes there will still be room for Paradox to take some risks through its Paradox Arc publishing label, but reiterates those more left field pursuits will still prioritize smaller teams and low budgets.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"That's a much better way of doing it, rather than trying to build a big team and then realizing quite late that we're actually lost. Then we have few options left—which is horrible for teams and studios," says Lilja.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"That's what I mean when I say go back to the core. Stay more where we are competent. Start small. Build from there. That's sort of the lesson here. It sounds obvious when you say it, but we weren't in that headspace a couple of years ago."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">For Lilja, it's about approaching production with a sense of calm and patience. He notes that Paradox will now very likely only pursue larger projects if they're "fairly close" to the studio's core competencies. It will also lean more heavily on peer reviews and user research in a bid to tip the scales of success in its favor.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">He says Paradox is still intent on becoming the "world's best publisher and developer of strategic simulations." Only time will tell if the company can turn that vision into reality.</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">News Editor, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Game Developer news editor Chris Kerr is an award-winning journalist and reporter with over a decade of experience in the game industry.

<p>"For the first time in its storied legacy, John Marston's beloved journey can be experienced on PC in stunning, new detail, with both Red Dead Redemption and its iconic zombie-horror companion story, Undead Nightmare, arriving to PC on 29th October," reads the description for the announcement on YouTube, above.</p><p>"In collaboration with Double Eleven, this new version adds PC-specific enhancements including native 4K resolution at up to 144hz on compatible hardware, monitor support for both Ultrawide (21:9) and Super Ultrawide (32:9), HDR10 support, and full keyboard and mouse functionality.</p>
<p>"There’s also support for NVIDIA DLSS 3.7 and AMD FSR 3.0 upscaling technologies, NVIDIA DLSS Frame Generation, adjustable draw distances, shadow quality settings, and more."</p>
<p>Red Dead Redemption was first released back in 2010 across PS3 and Xbox 360, but was re-released on PS4 and Switch in 2023. It's this version, from Double Eleven, making its way to PC.</p>
<p>Double Eleven has also worked on the likes of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fallout-76">Fallout 76</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/minecraft-dungeons">Minecraft Dungeons</a>, Grounded, and the Prison Architect series (until it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/prison-architect-developer-double-eleven-parts-way-with-paradox-after-nine-years-on-series">parted ways with publisher Paradox</a>).</p>
<p>Its prequel, Red Dead Redemption 2, has been available on PC since 2019.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/nvidia-dlss-3-will-be-available-in-fragpunk-and-simulakros/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The latest NVIDIA DLSS 3 additions roundup reveals two new games, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2943650/FragPunk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fragpunk</a> and Simulakros, that will support DLSS Frame Generation and DLSS Super Resolution.</p>
<p>The first is a 5v5 free-to-play hero-based competitive first-person shooter game developed by Bad Guitar Studio. According to the developers, no two rounds of FragPunk are ever the same. Players may discover more than 70 Shard Cards with an active selection that changes each round, creating new and unique combinations that offer virtually endless possibilities. Card examples include increases in jump height, reversing the roles of attacker and defender, engulfing your bullets in flame or turning them into chain lightning, and even resurrecting the player's character and their team.</p>
<p>FragPunk is described as a highly fast-paced experience with low TTK and quick rounds of two and a half minutes. Players can choose from ten heroes with different abilities, customize their weapon combo, and select their cards before entering the battle. Fifteen weapons are&nbsp;available, some of which have special abilities such as shooting faster over time, bursts, and more.</p>
<p>FragPunk's Closed Beta goes live on October 10, and NVIDIA DLSS 3 will already be implemented to offer an average performance boost of 2.8X at 4K resolution with all settings pushed to the max and ray tracing enabled. The RTX 4090 can push well over 200 frames per second on average, while the RTX 4080 SUPER is nearly at 160 frames per second, the RTX 4070 Ti SUPER runs the game at 140FPS, and the RTX 4070 SUPER is almost at 120.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>The second game is a single-player third-person shooter with roguelike elements set in a futuristic world. Developed by Sirio Games and published by Dear Villagers, Simulakros will see players try to disrupt the nefarious plans of an evil megacorporation with the help of a mysterious hacker. The game launches on October 10, although there is a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2621010/Simulakros_Demo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">demo</a> in case you want to check it out immediately. NVIDIA DLSS 3 is also included in Starship Troopers: Extermination, Offworld's 16-player coop first-person shooter that will <a href="https://wccftech.com/starship-troopers-extermination-1-0-launches-on-october-11-adding-single-player-mode-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">exit early access</a> on October 11.</p>
<p>Today marks the official release date of the highly anticipated Silent Hill 2 remake. The game offers NVIDIA DLSS 2 (Super Resolution), although users have already <a href="https://wccftech.com/silent-hill-2-remake-fsr-3-frame-generation-nvidia-dlss-ray-reconstruction-mod/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">found</a> a workaround to activate AMD FSR 3 Frame Generation and NVIDIA Ray Reconstruction (NVIDIA DLSS 3.5).</p>

			<p>GreedFall 2: The Dying World has officially entered Early Access, and with it, players will get to dive into a familiar world as a Teer Fradeen native, where there are also foreigners living on your land, which is causing trouble for a lot of the natives. In this game, you have to try and figure out why the world is dying while completing quests, partaking in combat, and romancing companions that you find along the way. Now that the game is in Early Access, only some of these features are available or are not available in its completed form. Here is everything you can expect from GreedFall 2: The Dying World's Early Access period.</p>
<h2>What To Expect From GreedFall 2 Early Access</h2>
<p>While plenty of games offer up an experience that has most of the gameplay available from the outset, GreedFall 2 is still in very early stages and there are only a couple of areas that players are able to explore from the outset. All of this information is listed on the Steam page, with the developers also listed what players can expect to be released over the Early Access period.</p>
<p>If you're unsure about whether you want to sink money into the GreedFall 2: The Dying World Early Access, we have <a href="https://wccftech.com/greedfall-2-the-dying-world/">a preview available</a> that lists some of our impressions of the RPG. Right now, for players who are considering purchasing the Early Access of GreedFall 2, keep in mind that the price is set to change once the game is fully released. The game is relatively pricy at the moment already, with it costing $39.99 with only a few beginning areas being available to explore at the moment. Spiders' has confirmed that the price is set to change as the game becomes fully developed.</p>
<p>Granted, GreedFall 2: The Dying World only entered Early Access as of Tuesday, but <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1997660?emclan=103582791471926029&amp;emgid=4686647673445136560" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the developers have already started making huge changes</a>. Here are some of the things you can expect from the Early Access period:</p>
<ul>
<li>Start of main Questline</li>
<li>6 Companions</li>
<li>6 Skill Trees</li>
<li>Teer Fradee, Thynia, and Uxantis exploration</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<p>This is just the start of the Early Access period, and as time goes on, they have more features planned, such as the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>New Companions</li>
<li>New Companion Quests</li>
<li>Main story extension</li>
<li>New Region</li>
<li>Hub becomes available</li>
<li>Two new Skill Trees</li>
<li>Crafting System</li>
<li>Teer Fradee and Uxantis local questlines</li>
<li>Photomode</li>
<li>Factions</li>
<li>Max level extension</li>
</ul>
<p>These are just some of the features planned for GreedFall 2: The Dying World's Early Access period. Spiders have also answered some of the most Frequently Asked Questions, so players know what they're getting into.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/like-a-dragon-pirate-yakuza-in-hawaii-started-out-as-a-kiryu-fishing-game.1003599/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/like-dragon-pirate-yakuza-in-hawaii-fishing-kiryu<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii&nbsp;</em>was originally intended to be a fishing spinoff starring longtime series protagonist Kazuma Kiryu, studio director Masayoshi Yokoyama has revealed.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/10/08/like-a-dragon-pirate-yakuza-in-hawaii-interview/?sf274964865=1" rel="noopener" target="_blank">new interview on the PlayStation Blog</a>, Yokoyama says that for "quite some time", he's been wanting to make a game titled&nbsp;<em>Like a Dragon: Tuna</em>, which would star the Dragon of Dojima himself as a tuna fisherman.</p>
<p>Yokoyama says this game would revolve around Kiryu "fight[ing] against fishing boats" at sea. His dream (that's Yokoyama's, not Kiryu's) never saw the light of day, but ideas from it evolved into the piratical story of <i>Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii</i>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/like-a-dragon-pirate-yakuza-in-hawaii-majima-guns.jpg?itok=lqnjKv4S 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/like-a-dragon-pirate-yakuza-in-hawaii-majima-guns.jpg?itok=HQjZUqVM 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii&nbsp;</em>was, at one stage, a fishing game starring Kazuma Kiryu.</figcaption></figure><p>In the interview, Yokoyama also reveals that the ideas for&nbsp;<em>Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii&nbsp;</em>were percolating as early as last summer, long before latest mainline installment&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/like-dragon-infinite-wealth-gets-release-date-rpg-gameplay-confirmed"><em>Infinite Wealth&nbsp;</em>was released</a>.</p>
<p>He says spinoffs are "perfect in size for adults", comparing the mainline series to "an all-you-can-eat restaurant" in which you can gorge yourself on whatever you like. Spinoffs, by contrast, are "well-balanced, good-proportion meals", according to Yokoyama.</p>
<p>We also learn how Yokoyama is dealing with Majima's "unpredictability" as a character; he says that's the reason behind the ex-yakuza's amnesia.</p>
<p>Maijma's unpredictability makes him "intriguing", Yokoyama says, but it also creates a disconnect between players' emotions and Majima's emotions. To transform him into a more conventional protagonist, Yokoyama says, it was either amnesia or time travel. I guess the series isn't quite that ridiculous...yet.</p>

<p>When it comes to combat, Yokoyama says the new jump move was introduced "because the character Majima looks good while jumping". That's right; it wasn't for any concrete gameplay reason, but just because the devs thought it looked cool.</p>
<p><em>Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/like-dragon-pirate-yakuza-in-hawaii-announced">launches on February 28th</a>&nbsp;across <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3061810/Like_a_Dragon_Pirate_Yakuza_in_Hawaii/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/like-a-dragon-pirate-yakuza-in-hawaii/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/like-a-dragon-pirate-yakuza-in-hawaii/9ns00hqcz0cj" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Xbox</a>.

            <p>
Paradox Interactive have not had a rosy couple of years. While the company's core business in grand strategy remains prosperous, their approach to games outside this niche has been mired by delays, cancelations, closures and layoffs. Let's run through the big setbacks: The Lamplighters League, which we overall <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-lamplighters-league-review">liked</a>, was a $22 million financial flop - Paradox <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/lamplighter-developers-harebrained-go-indie-as-paradox-decides-against-new-project-or-sequel-in-the-same-genre">have now parted ways with creators Harebrained Studios</a>. Cities Skylines 2 should have been a victory lap, after the success of the first game, but it <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/cities-skyline-2-devs-considered-release-delay-to-boost-performance-but-decided-its-not-a-dealbreaker">launched with severe bugs and performance issues</a>. Prison Architect 2, another follow-up to a hit game, has been <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/paradox-delays-prison-architect-2-and-cancels-preorders-improving-the-performance-has-proven-to-be-a-task-that-will-take-time">delayed indefinitely</a>, and Paradox have split from developers Double Eleven. Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2 is borderline vapourware: originally announced in 2019 with Hardsuit Labs at the helm, it's currently in the hands of The Chinese Room, and was recently <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-has-been-delayed-again-this-time-until-the-first-half-of-2025">delayed for the umpteenth time</a> into 2025.</p>
<p>And then there's the abrupt cancellation of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/life-by-you">Life By You</a>, a life management sim designed to compete directly with The Sims 4, and the closure of its creators Paradox Tectonic. Writing-down the development of Life By You <a href="file:///C:/Users/cex/Downloads/Interim%20report%20January%20%E2%80%93%20June%202024%20(correction).pdf">cost</a> Paradox around 208 million krona, or $19.2 million. It was the primary contributor to a 90% decrease in the company's operating profit for the second quarter of 2024, versus the same quarter in 2023.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
Paradox recently invited journalists to a Media Day in London, seeking to reset perceptions and explore what they've learned from this run of disasters. I have a few stories from that event, which we'll run over the next week or two, but above all, I wanted to ask about Life By You. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/paradox-reveal-life-by-you-a-competitor-to-the-sims-from-former-ea-boss">Announced barely a year before cancellation in March 2023</a> with a former EA boss at the helm, it was an undisguised attempt to usurp The Sims, with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/life-by-you-has-grand-designs-on-the-sims-life-sim-throne">a host of ambitious elements</a> such as context-sensitive generated dialogue. I thought it made a lot of sense for Paradox to try its hand at a life sim - a genre that can be as system-led as grand strategy, but with a lighter, more approachable format that might have lured in players who aren't massive history buffs.
</p>
<p>In an interview at the event, Paradox's deputy chief executive officer Mattias Lilja agreed that Life By You was a "strategically sensible project" for Paradox, adding that the company haven't given up on the life sim genre. "It makes sense to us strategically, finding that core team who want to do that game for us is a really good idea, and I think we should try again, if we have a similar opportunity," he told me.
</p><p>
Next time, however, Paradox need to make smaller investments at the outset and be prepared for a longer spell in prototyping, Lilja went on. "We need to do it a different way. We need to start with a smaller team. We need to do pre-production longer. We need to prototype a lot, before we go into big production, because when you have a full game team, quite honestly, it costs a lot, so any pivot is going to cost all of that."
</p>
<p>
The game's relative expense meant it had to show significant progress faster than the developers could manage, Lilja said. "We were not getting the game we wanted, and the burn rate and cost was really high at that point, which is on us as a publisher. The devs did everything they could, but there were lots of them, so any major change would just put us more into [debt]. We were digging a hole that was just getting deeper. That's why we had to stop it, and we didn't really see any other option. It's not like you can change dev team - we have to stop now." 
</p>
<p>The game's problems were too fundamental to iron out in early access, Lilja added. "If we thought people would be happy, we would have released it, but we were certain that they wouldn't. So we had to stop."
</p>
<p>
Paradox's chief creator officer Henrik Fåhraeus echoed much of this in a separate interview at the event. "The thing with that game is we saw a lot of problems for a long time," he said of Life By You. Fåhraeus touched briefly on the game's graphics being "not good enough" for Paradox leadership, but added that Life By You's issues were more "big picture". 
</p><p>
"What is the player experience going to be like, is it going to be better than Sims 4 in some way, at least?" he said. "And the unfortunate answer to that is that I didn't feel it would be, and the other people who tested it were of sort of the same opinion. 
</p>
<p>
"So, it's not about single points of failure, if you will, it's more the big picture experience of playing the game, and even in early access, you need to have a really solid experience that is fun and bug-free. It can be a little thin on content, sure, that's not the big problem. It's having that really fun experience playing. The game needs to be there."
</p>
<p>
Like Lilja, Fåhraeus thinks Paradox have a future in the life sim genre. "The greenlighting of Life By You was perfectly reasonable, I think," he said. "It does kind of fit our pillars in many ways." While Fåhraeus acknowledges that life sims are "less challenging" than the grand strategy sims Paradox have a reputation for, he argues they rely on a similar mix of the "cerebral" and "creativity". "So a life sim made sense, and perhaps still make sense," he concluded.
</p>
<p>All this will likely make sour reading for people who used to work at Paradox Tectonic. Some of the laid-off developers have spoken out publicly against the cancellation, insisting that the game was in better shape than advertised. In June this year, a few months after Life By You was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/sims-contender-life-by-you-gets-delayed-once-again-this-time-indefinitely">delayed indefinitely</a>, game designer Willem Delventhal <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/new-screenshots-from-canceled-paradox-sim-life-by-you-show-off-all-the-fits-well-never-get">aired his frustrations</a> on LinkedIn, claiming that development was going "extremely well" before Paradox suspended launch for the final time.

"I cannot share specific numbers, but I can say that we had an internal metric we were aiming for that had been approved, and that we exceeded that number by a significant portion," he wrote. "We also got a thumbs up a few weeks before launch." 
</p>
<p>
According to Delventhal, the developers "spent a month in purgatory" after release was postponed indefinitely, during which "we did everything we could to prove to them we were worth launching, including things like finding potential buyers or suggesting cutting ties and going indie. We heard virtually nothing back."</p>
<p>When I asked Lilja what he thought of these comments, he declined to go into much depth. "I'm going to try and not get into that," he said. "I'm going to own up to what we as publishers did, and try not to comment too much on the dev side. I understand that they have their view, and I might agree or not, but it's mostly because I don't want to get into a fight, throwing stuff between us and devs. I don't think that's helpful for anyone.

"But I can tell you that the game was not what we needed it to be. The promise that they talked about, that people got excited about, was not the game that we were looking at. And there were many different reasons, and I'm going to own up that we did not control or help them steer that in a good way - that's on us."
