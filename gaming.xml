            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://gameinformer.com/2025/04/08/the-outlast-trials-final-season-2-update-goes-live-today<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>The Outlast Trials’ latest update goes live today, with the rogue Reagent Amelia Collier taking center stage. She has laid out the path of other prisoners to escape the Sinyala Facility, giving players a chance to make a break for it in the final update for Season 2 before Season 3 kicks off at the end of the month.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Red Barrels’ provides the following synopsis for Season 2.2 of Project Breach:</p>

<p>“Amelia has managed to trick the system, creating a brief means of escape for the victims of Dr. Easterman and his unethical experiments. Thanks to her carefully positioned Escape Plans and other tools, Reagants can now attempt their own getaway to try and free themselves from the horrors of the Sinyala Facility.&nbsp;</p>

<p>But Murkoff won’t let them go without a fight. Doubling down on the extreme surveillance already embedded throughout the facility, the risk of being exposed to the all-seeing eye is greater than ever before.”</p>

<p><iframe allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pNCpOhZk-iM" width="640"></iframe></p>

<p>Season 2.2 introduces the new gameplay event, The Escape, which tasks four players with fleeing the Sinyala Facility. Under Survellience Part II lets players resume their progress from Part 1, offering a more challenging romp as players must avoid being spotted while locating escape plans or watching Amelia’s message before Murkoff does.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Completing these trials earns Event Tokens that can be spent acquiring cosmetics from the new limited-time Amelia Catalog. The catalog will only be available until April 22; any unspent event tokens will be lost. Season 3 of The Outlast Trials begins on April 22, introducing new elements while closing off the Rebirth hallway for the foreseeable future. You can read the Season 2.2 changes <a href="https://redbarrelsgames.com/news/new-update-escape-0408/">here</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Outlast Trials is available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, PC.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/no-other-game-is-shaped-like-blue-prince.1158978/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/blue-prince-impressions-review<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The total novelty of <em>Blue Prince </em>makes description difficult but necessary. There are many things <em>Blue Prince</em> is like: art board game, roguelite, narrative puzzle game. It’s one of the most novel and daring games I’ve played in ages. It feels engineered in a lab to be talked about, studied, and critiqued. It is catnip for game critics, and I have to admit it got my ass real good.</p><figure><figcaption>The manor awaits.</figcaption></figure><p>In contrast to its thorough inventiveness, <em>Blue Prince </em>starts with a well worn trope: the “on one condition” will. Your great uncle Herbert S. Sinclair has left you his estate of Mount Holly, under the condition that you can get to the secret 46th room of the 45-room mansion. The complication is that the mansion’s layout is not static, but rather a structure that you build every single day, room by room. The mansion’s map is a tile-based grid, and you have a select number of rooms in the pool to build out your mansion. You start with a fixed number of steps you can take, each step representing moving into a room. These steps can be refilled by activities like resting in bedrooms and eating food. If you run out of stamina, the day is over, and you must rest and return the following day. If you run into a dead end, you will probably have to hang it up as well. Tools, items, money and gems can be collected, but cannot be transferred to a different day except under specific conditions. At the end of the day, the tiles on the house reset unless specified otherwise.&nbsp;</p><figure></figure><p>The board game element of <em>Blue Prince </em>requires strategic understanding of how the pool&nbsp; or rooms and the structure of the house works. Many rooms in your pool, like closets and bathrooms, are dead ends that can end your run if you draw them at the wrong time. Strategically burning those rooms early in places where they won’t be a nuisance becomes key to survival. On top of that, items like gems and keys become increasingly important as you get deeper into the mansion, so budgeting them for later becomes important as time goes on. You also have a few rooms with regular puzzles, including a variant of the Two Doors riddle and what I can only describe as “Dartboard PEMDAS,” that reward you with resources and teach you their internal logic. The only criticism of how the game is implemented is that at least one puzzle and the rooms themselves are color-themed, and the game’s color blindness accessibility feature is still a work in progress, currently being tested and developed according to the in-game menu.&nbsp;</p><figure></figure><p>In addition to the stated goal of getting to Room 46, each individual room has clues to a greater mystery and a more intriguing plot. Often, it’s worth burning a run to go into a room you haven’t been in to advance the larger metagame. Sometimes these puzzles involve unlocking other parts of the grounds of the estate in ways that make the primary task easier. Other times, it’s in the service of something far grander. Much of the joy is the discovery of picking the game apart, so I will not spoil anything else, but it is some of the most interesting environmental storytelling I have seen in ages.&nbsp;</p><figure></figure><p>There are flavors of other games in <em>Blue Prince</em>,<em> </em>but absolutely nothing that is like it. You can point to many games – anything Cyan has made, <em>What Remains of Edith Finch</em>, several board games, the <em>Zero Escape </em>games, <em>Outer Wilds</em>, <em>Inscryption</em>, but the second you talk about any other part of the game the comparison falls apart. What if <em>Riven </em>was a roguelite? What if <em>Telling Lies </em>was a deckbuilder? What if <em>Pipe Mania </em>was themed like <em>The Masque of the Red Death</em>? What if the board game <em>Carcassonne </em>was also a mystery novel?&nbsp;</p><figure></figure><p>This layering has an additive effect. Where games like <em>The Witness</em> and <em>Myst</em> often become an impenetrable brick wall for the player to bash their head against, the daily construction of <em>Blue Prince</em>’s house engages a different part of your brain and paces out the overall mysteries. The house itself is a little busy box that constantly engages you, unjamming any frustrating mental blocks by suggesting new angles of attack, as well as offering many different pathways to the same solution. I solved many puzzles through inference only to be told the solution later in a different way. It is a game that solves solutions to problems I did not know the puzzle and adventure genres had.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Blue Prince</em> is a far larger game than I could have ever predicted; I have spent about 55 hours in it and I am not “done” with it. It is a game that is best played with a <a href="https://aftermath.site/lorelei-and-the-laser-eyes-end" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">buddy</a>, occasionally dropping each other oblique hints to the mysteries still unsolved but never spoiling it for yourself. Like a house with many shifting rooms, <em>Blue Prince</em>’s constituent parts are immediately recognizable, but the totality is impossible to narrow down. It deserves every bit of the overwhelming praise it has gotten, and will be talked about for years to come. It is a game of novelty, new blood in a stagnant age. <em>Blue Prince</em> is the future of something new.&nbsp;</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/games-writing-words-that-are-bad"><h3>Games Writing Words I Hate</h3></a><p>Let's get pedantic, my favorite thing to be</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/manga-no-name-ending-edgerunners"><h3>The Truth Behind The Sudden Conclusion Of Cyberpunk: Edgerunners Showrunner’s Short-Lived Manga Series</h3></a><p>Edgerunners showrunner Rafał Jaki mythbusts the ins-and-outs of creating his historic manga series, No\Name</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/aftermath-site-subscriber-goals-2025"><h3>Aftermath Vs 2025</h3></a><p>We've got even bigger plans than last year, and we need your help</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Joel had initially asked Tommy to take Ellie to the Fireflies after he admitted he wasn’t strong enough to do it and couldn’t after the loss of his daughter, Sarah.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/news/645555/arduboy-victim-trump-tariffs-us-china-kevin-bates<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Kevin Bates managed to quit his day job and move to China after his game-playing business card, <a href="https://gizmodo.com/you-can-finally-buy-that-tiny-video-game-playing-busine-1703207365">the Arduboy</a>, went viral in 2014. But a decade later, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/604742/trump-tariffs-canada-mexico-china-updates">Trump’s staggering</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/business/643970/trade-war-consequences-crazy">inexplicable new US tariffs</a> are driving him out of business.</p><p>Just as he was about to turn a profit for the first time, just before he was about to bring a new product to retail, he tells <em>The Verge</em> that his company can no longer survive as-is. He says that despite lifetime Arduboy sales of over $1 million, much of it from recent growth in 2023 and 2024, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/645305/trump-104-percent-china-tariffs">Trump’s new 104 percent China tariffs</a> will be the beginning of the end.</p><p>“I just like making circuit boards and helping people learn to code games. This is all too much,” he says.</p><p>Even if he wanted to — Bates admits he’s been looking to sunset Arduboy for a while — he says he wouldn’t be able to satisfy Trump’s stated goal of restarting manufacturing in the US.</p><p>“There are no manufacturers in the USA who would even answer an email to produce Arduboy, much less give a good price. I could build them myself and end up making about $10 an hour, still paying a crazy amount for components.”</p><p>Instead, he says, his options are to dramatically raise prices, find a way around the tariffs, or simply kill off Arduboy for good.</p><p>“The fact Arduboy could exist at all was kind of a miracle of global trade. An individual person, producing and distributing an international product with margins that would never work at a larger company. I didn’t need 80 percent markup to survive,” he says, adding that his actual margins ranged from 30 to 50 percent.</p><p>Trump’s US tariffs would entirely wipe out those margins, and he says China’s retaliatory tariffs would hurt too, as they would impose a 34 percent tariff on <a href="https://www.microchip.com/en-us/product/atmega32u4">the Arduboy’s US-made processor</a>, which Bates says is the most expensive component in the system.</p><p>While he’s hopeful that some larger organization might buy Arduboy and take up the torch, he admits that’s not terribly realistic in this economic climate, and he’s already declaring Arduboy “dead” <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7315460443198627841/">on his LinkedIn</a> and <a href="https://community.arduboy.com/t/tariffs-killed-arduboy/12675">in the Arduboy forums.</a> He’s already looking for a new day job once again.</p><p>But he says Arduboy isn’t <em>quite</em> dead yet. He wants to launch one last Kickstarter for a USB-C version of the Arduboy with “more features like real time clock, IR blaster, and link cable support,” assuming he can figure out how to ship them at a price people will pay. He says he already saw $99 Arduboy FX Special Edition as overpriced for what it is, and he isn’t looking forward to charging $200 for a new version or saddling buyers with customs fees should he choose to drop-ship them.</p><p>“The only realistic solution is to warehouse the inventory somewhere that doesn’t have Chinese import taxes, and drop ship everything. I visited my factory last year to talk about this, and they said all their customers are in the same situation so they said they would have a solution. But one has not materialized yet,” he says.</p><p>Speaking of drop-shipping and customs fees, that is probably what you should expect if you buy <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/642692/banana-bit-game-boy-arduboy-handheld-console-gaming">the new banana-shaped Arduboy</a> or the <a href="https://www.arduboy.com/shop/p/special-edition">last few remaining units of the Arduboy FX Special Edition</a>. “I am planning to fulfill the orders but they may be drop shipped, so U.S. customers should be aware that import taxes may now apply,” he tells <em>The Verge</em>. But he also may just turn off Banana-Bit preorders, as he says he’s only sold about a dozen so far.</p><p>He also warns these packages could get held up at US customs for a time, because Trump <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/642601/donald-trump-tariffs-de-minimis-shein-temu">has also gotten rid of the de minimis exemption</a> that let low-value packages enter the US duty-free. “That’s going to impact everything from Shein to Temu to AliExpress, and honestly, it’s going to be chaos. U.S. customs isn’t ready for that volume,” he says.</p><p>Bates says Trump’s trade war is “an absolute unmitigated disaster for anyone without the ability to dramatically restructure.”</p><p>“I guess that’s the point,” he adds.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Right, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/doom-the-dark-ages">Doom: The Dark Ages</a> is still a month away, but I'm guessing there's some of you that could do with a bit of boomer shooting to fill the gap in the meantime. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/metal-eden">Metal Eden</a> will probably scratch that itch, the next game from the devs behind the quite violent and flashy <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/ruiner">Ruiner</a>, given that it's out May 6th. That's still about a month away though, so you could always try out the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3468980/METAL_EDEN__Demo/">free demo that dropped today</a> offering a small taste of its sci-fi shooter.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
The demo seems like a pretty beefy one too, you can try out the first two missions of the game. It should be noted that this doesn't appear to be a "save data carries over to the main game" kind of demo, but Metal Eden seems like the kind of game you'll want to replay to get better and better at anyway. Which, funnily enough, is kind of the point, as over on Steam Reikon Games shared that it's hosting a speedrun challenge of the game in partnership with <a href="https://www.speedrun.com/challenges/9x32q3l6-Metal_Eden-metal-eden-demo-speedrun-challenge">speedrun.com</a>.

<p>
Honestly, if you're good at making like <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/sonic-the-hedgehog">Sonic the Hedgehog</a>, you genuinely might want to give it a go. As long as you've submitted your run by April 15th, you'll be in with a chance to win a share of a $1000 prize pool. You will need to come somewhere within the top three to get some of that share, so good luck if you do give it a go.
</p>
<p>
I love a game that features parkour, or at least movement like it. I'm still chasing the thrill of games like <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mirrors-edge">Mirror's Edge</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/titanfall-2">Titanfall 2</a>, so Metal Eden seems like it's worth a quick punt at least. Doubt I'll make it into the top three in best times though.

            <p>The British Academy of Film and Television Arts (or BAFTA, if you're after something a bit snappier) has announced the winners of this year's BAFTA Games Awards - and it's very much been <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/astro-bot">Astro Bot</a>'s night, with the acclaimed PlayStation 5 platformer taking home the gong in five categories including Best Game.</p>
<p>Astro Bot's Best Game victory saw it win out over fellow nominees Balatro, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/black-myth-wukong">Black Myth: Wukong</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom">The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</a>, and Thank Goodness You're Here. And it was equally successful in the BAFTA Games Awards' Animation, Audio Achievement, Family, and Game Design categories.</p>
<p>Team Asobi's Astro Bot didn't entirely hog the limelight, however. Balatro, by developer LocalThunk, took the top spot in the Debut Game category, while Coal Supper's superb comedy oddity Thank Goodness You're Here was crowned Best British Game. Elsewhere, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/arrowhead-game-studios">Arrowhead Game Studios</a>' Helldivers 2 secured two gongs - winning out in BAFTA's multiplayer and Music categories - while Nomada Studio's Neva won Artistic Achievement, and Atlus' Metaphor: Metaphor: ReFantazio trumped fellow nominees for Narrative.

Speaking of which, Alec Newman was victorious in the Performer in a Leading Role category for his portrayal of Cameron "Caz" McLeary in Still Wakes the Deep, while Karen Dunbar took the gong for best Performer in Supporting Role as Finlay in the game.</p>

That’s according to Nintendo of America president Doug Bowser, who <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=svRmWFAGLJg">said on CNBC Monday</a> that Nintendo had time to build up an inventory of the next-gen portable gaming system “on a global basis,” and that many have already landed, including “some” in the United States.</p><p>“We really do hope we can meet that demand,” said Bowser. When asked if Nintendo can meet that demand, Bowser replied, “That remains to be seen. That certainly is our goal.” The original Switch remained hard to find for quite a while after it launched in the spring of 2017, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/4/26/17283938/nintendo-switch-earnings-fy-2017-2018-forecast">selling more consoles by April 2018</a> (17.79 million) than its predecessor, the Wii U, sold in five years (13.56 million).</p><p>Bowser told <em>The Verge</em> that Nintendo is “actively assessing” the impact of the latest tariffs, but that was before Nintendo decided to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/643483/nintendo-switch-2-preorders-delayed-tariffs">delay Switch 2 preorders</a> in the US and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/645240/nintendo-switch-2-canada-preorders-delayed-trump-tariffs">Canada</a> from the original April 9th date. Nintendo says it’s still on track to launch the console on June 5th. On Tuesday, analyst DFC Intelligence cut its Switch 2 forecast for the year from 17 million units to 15 million, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-04-08/switch-2-sales-forecast-is-cut-by-researcher-over-trump-tariffs"><em>Bloomberg</em></a> reports. That prediction would still make it the fastest-selling console ever, despite tariffs and the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/642868/nintendo-switch-2-price-console-games-accessories">budget-stretching price of $449.99</a>.</p><p>The new tariffs announced after the Switch 2 event could be hard on Nintendo since the company is building Switch 2 in Vietnam, which is in line for a 46 percent tariff.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Activision has been hellbent on jamming as many crossovers into the Call of Duty universe as possible these days. We’ve seen some bizarre topics surface, leading to inane in-game events and laughable skins that have players craving something a little more grounded.</p>



<p>In a recent claim from a prolific Call of Duty insider, it was suggested that Activision is acutely aware of the feedback from the wider community suggesting that Call of Duty is becoming a laughing stock because of these weird skins and irrelevant crossovers.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-self-awareness-is-key">Self-Awareness is Key</h2>



<p>In a post on social media, <a href="https://x.com/TheGhostOfHope/status/1909627607567458504" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">TheGhostofHope</a> gave feedback about the performance of Warzone and how Verdansk has boosted the game’s player count on all platforms.</p>



<p>He then turned to talk about the future of Warzone, suggesting that Activision’s teams are proposing taking a more restrained approach to skins and bundles in the game:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>They are talking about showing more restraint with Warzone for skins/bundles/microtransactions. Crossovers are ‘printing money’ but they hear the criticism that the game is starting to look stupid.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Gone are the days when people ran around Call of Duty dressed exclusively in milsim outfits. The rise of the free-to-play battle royale platform meant that microtransactions had to be ramped up, thus leaving us with countless crossovers and collaborations with musicians, television shows, movies, and other games.</p>



<p>They might be ‘printing money’, but perhaps die-hard Call of Duty fans are growing tired of the number of neon-lit, over-the-top, impossible outfits in the game.</p>

<p>We assembled data for those game baskets across 21 non-consecutive years, going back to 1982, then normalized the nominal prices to consistent February 2025 dollars using <a href="https://www.bls.gov/data/inflation_calculator.htm">the Bureau of Labor Statistics CPI calculator</a>.

<h2>The bad old days</h2>
<p>In purely nominal terms, the $30 to $40 retailers routinely charged for game cartridges in the 1980s seems like a relative bargain. Looking at the inflation-adjusted data, though, it's easy to see how even an $80 game today would seem like a bargain to console gamers in the cartridge era.</p>

<p>New cartridge games in the 20th century routinely retailed for well over $100 in 2025 money, thanks to a combination of relatively high manufacturing costs and relatively low competition in the market. While you could often get older and/or used cartridges for much less than that in practice, must-have new games at the time often cost the equivalent of $140 or more in today's money.</p>

<p>Pricing took a while to calm down once CD-based consoles were introduced in the late '90s. By the beginning of the '00s, though, nominal top-end game pricing had fallen to about $50, and only rose back to $60 by the end of the decade. Adjusting for inflation, however, those early 21st century games were still demanding prices approaching $90 in 2025 dollars, well above the new $80 nominal price ceiling <em>Mario Kart World </em>is trying to establish.</p>

<p>In the 2010s, inflation started eating into the value of gaming's de facto $60 price ceiling, which remained remarkably consistent throughout the decade. Adjusted for inflation, the nominal average pricing we found for our game "baskets" in 2013, 2017, and 2020 ended up almost precisely equivalent to $80 in constant 2025 dollars.</p>
<h2>Is this just what things cost now?</h2>
<p>While the jump to an $80 price might seem sudden, the post-COVID jump in inflation makes it almost inevitable. After decades of annual inflation rates in the 2 to 3 percent range, the <a href="https://www.minneapolisfed.org/about-us/monetary-policy/inflation-calculator/consumer-price-index-1913-">Consumer Price Index</a> jumped 4.7 percent in 2021 and a whopping 8 percent in 2022. In the years since, annual price increases still haven't gotten below the 3 percent level that was once seen as "high."</p>

			<p>Earlier today, we <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-estimated-to-sell-15m-units-in-2025-in-resounding-success-but-tariffs-shadow-remains/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported</a> on the latest Nintendo Switch 2 market analysis from DFC Intelligence. The analysts reckon it'll become the fastest-selling console ever with 15 million units sold in 2025, although the impact of the tariffs, should they be here to stay, is impossible to fully predict.</p>
<p>When we received the report, we also got the opportunity to speak with founder, CEO, and principal David Cole to learn more about their insights on the Nintendo Switch 2 and the potential impact of the US tariffs on the whole games industry.</p>
<p><strong>Hello, David. Were you expecting that $450 price, or were you, maybe, like many other colleagues, waiting for Nintendo to announce a $400 price?</strong></p>
<p>We were concerned about the tariff issue before the announcements. Obviously, there are a lot of moving parts. They get parts from all over Asia that go into the system. With tariffs going into effect, we were concerned the price would be $500 or more, so when it came in at $450, we were actually pretty happy. $400 would obviously have been the best-case scenario, but we thought $450 was a solid market price.</p>
<p>Obviously, when they <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-pre-order-not-april-9th-tariffs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> on Friday that they were going to put the pre-orders on hold, that's a whole new ball game. Clearly, this is an ongoing issue that I think everybody's trying to figure out. We met with Nintendo executives last week and they were confident in the pricing, but it's an economic environment that nobody can really predict. The decisions are made out of Japan on that pricing and it has to tie closely into what they feel they can lose.</p>
<p>Nintendo is a public company that's very much dependent on hardware sales to, if not generate a profit, at least not generate a loss. They're not like Microsoft, which has taken a big loss on hardware just to try and build an installed base. Nintendo doesn't tend to do that, so we are very concerned about the issue of, will they be forced to increase the price? Will they limit their manufacturing? Right now, they're cranking up the manufacturing and building up the inventory. They have quite a bunch of Nintendo Switch 2 inventory ready for launch, but going forward in the next few months, they may start to scale back on manufacturing a little bit.</p>
<p>There just may be another case of shortages, hopefully not as bad as what we saw with the<br>
PlayStation 5, but they may start to control inventory more, which would affect our topline forecasts because there would not be enough units to meet demand.</p>
<p><strong>That makes sense. It looks like they didn't factor in the tariffs for their initial Nintendo Switch 2 pricing. In your report, you're expecting a 20% price increase over the next couple of years. Were you referring to the Switch 2 or just generally across the industry?</strong></p>
<p>I think we're looking at prices on hardware, accessories, and software. Everything is set to increase and we've modeled that in our forecast. There will be declines in prices hopefully within the 2-year period. Obviously, it's a changing environment out there. The latest news I heard was that there would be a 90-day hold on these tariffs, but I think that's probably fake news. People are speculating every which way, which makes it very difficult to forecast accurately, knowing that it can really hit on two, with fewer products getting manufactured where they scale back on accessories.</p>
<p>Obviously, they have things like a camera and all kinds of different accessories. One of the first things they'll do is probably scale back on how much inventory is produced because they definitely don't want to build up inventory. You get a situation where the cost of manufacturing is higher and the cost of passing that on to the consumer is higher. You also have consumers knowing that this tariff price increase is probably temporary, so prices will hopefully come down. I'm going to wait a few months. Now that they've announced that $450 price, it's going to be tough to roll it back. That's a real catch-22 because I think if they were forced to increase the price and pass that on to consumers, a lot of consumers would look at it and say "Well, they announced the $450 price. They're increasing it because of the tariffs, but I'm just going to wait and wait till the prices roll back." It's a real catch-22.</p>
<p><strong>I was wondering if you think Microsoft might be forced to raise the price of the Xbox consoles. Of course, it's a US company, but the consoles are not actually manufactured in the United States.</strong></p>
<p>Exactly. The impact is far-ranging and it's not just the video game industry, it's all consumer products, so you have this huge macroeconomic situation where prices are increasing across the board. The video game industry is definitely not isolated in this issue.</p>
<figure><figcaption>'I think that that is going to be a huge change for the game industry. In the past, people said Nintendo was kind of their own ecosystem and not really competing with what Sony and Microsoft are doing. Now, they are stepping up to say "Hey, we're going to be a platform for serious AAA third-party game publishers." They've realized that the audience is expanding and they're definitely going after it. There's a real potential to shake up.'</figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>Indeed. You believe that the Nintendo Switch 2 could potentially engage more directly with the PlayStation and Xbox fanbases compared to the original Switch, right?</strong></p>
<p>Exactly. We've done all kinds of research on that topic because what we've seen is really that the Switch had nice penetration among PlayStation and Xbox owners who are looking for a second system. If you bought a PlayStation, instead of buying an Xbox, you tend to buy a Switch. Even among the core PC gaming community, if you're a big PC gamer, you know a lot of those games you play are going to be available on the PlayStation and Xbox, but you go buy a Switch because the products that Nintendo puts out aren't available anywhere else.</p>
<p>I think what you see with the Nintendo Switch 2 is Nintendo really focusing on that audience with a lot of third-party content and features like mouse controls. It's pretty interesting how they're able to offer a unique platform that in many cases for these core users is a secondary platform, but could become more and more of a primary platform, especially now that you can get a lot of sports titles and more mature titles like Cyberpunk 2077. Then you have products from FromSoftware, which I thought was really interesting. <a href="https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-cyberpunk-2077-hades-2-and-more-confirmed-for-nintendo-switch-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">They're bringing Elden Ring to the Switch 2</a>, but they're also announcing <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-duskbloods-will-feature-over-12-playable-characters-fromsoftware-isnt-abandoning-single-player/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an exclusive title from From Software</a>, which was interesting because Sony has been investing and partnering heavily with From Software (they made an acquisition late last year to become <a href="https://wccftech.com/sony-becomes-largest-shareholder-of-fromsoftware-parent-kadokawa-corporation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the largest minority shareholder in From Software's parent company</a>). That's a pretty big feather in Nintendo's cap to have such an exclusive.</p>
<p>At the same time, of course, they have that core Nintendo fanboy base that goes along with whatever Nintendo is putting out in most cases. I think that is going to be a huge change for the game industry. In the past, people said Nintendo was kind of their own ecosystem and not really competing with what Sony and Microsoft are doing. Now, they are stepping up to say "Hey, we're going to be a platform for serious AAA third-party game publishers." They've realized that the audience is expanding and they're definitely going after it. There's a real potential to shake up, more on the console side, not so much on the PC side, where you'd still see the Nintendo Switch 2 Switch as a secondary system.</p>
<p><strong>In addition, Microsoft <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-announces-10-year-committment-for-call-of-duty-on-switch-and-steam/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">promised</a> a while ago that they would bring Call of Duty to Nintendo platforms. The Nintendo Switch 2 seems a perfect fit for that, especially with the mouse-like controls.</strong></p>
<p>Exactly. It gives options to people who may want to play in different ways. Some people want to play with a controller and then you got a huge audience that loves to play with mouse controls. They're delivering more versatility.</p>
<p><strong>Do you think that the new Nintendo console may eat more into the Xbox base or the PlayStation's?</strong></p>
<p>Well, the Xbox base is pretty weak right now, so I think it's going to eat more into Sony's PlayStation base. Microsoft's strategy remains unclear. They're focused on diversifying across platforms, they're looking at what kind of new hardware form factor to deliver. The PlayStation 5 is the really competing console platform right now out there. Whether that changes when Microsoft announces something new remains to be seen, but right now, it's really going directly after the PlayStation base.</p>
<p><strong>The Nintendo Switch 2 is doubling down on the handheld capabilities. Just yesterday, Phil Spencer teased an Xbox handheld once again, and there have been rumors even of PlayStation considering another handheld. Do you think there is space in the market for new PlayStation and Xbox handhelds, or is it just getting saturated with the Steam Deck and other PC handhelds?</strong></p>
<p>The problem with Sony and Microsoft, with both the PlayStation 5 and the Xbox Series S|X, was that they were basically just power upgrades. They were more powerful versions of what came before, and they didn't really shift the market dynamics, so I think both Sony and Microsoft are scrambling, knowing that this is an era where portable gaming is huge. They don't really have an option for that. Sony tried major efforts with the PSP and the PS Vita back in the day, but they just were not able to gain any market traction. Sony has clearly said the PlayStation 5 is on the downtail of its life cycle. They've missed forecasts the past two years and it did great at launch. Now, sales are not weak, but they're not as strong as Sony expected and they've come out and said it's clearly on the decline.</p>
<p>The question is, what answer will Sony and Microsoft have in terms of new hardware? Do they reinvent their systems to become more like a Switch with a portable option? Nintendo has had 30-plus years in portable gaming devices, while Sony's had some failed experiments. The track record is not strong for either of those companies. They need to try and come up with something, but whether they can, that's the open question right now.</p>
<p><strong>Returning to the Nintendo Switch 2, one of the big shocking points of the reveal was, of course, the pricing, <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-game-prices-go-up-to-e90/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">especially for Mario Kart World at $80 (€90 in Europe)</a>. Some people are still a bit shocked. Do you think it may be more of an exception than the rule?</strong></p>
<p>Yeah, it's going to be more of the exception rather than the rule. There's already quite a wide range of price points. Third-party titles are coming in and they're not going up to that price range. There's a lot of flexibility on pricing with types of software. Nintendo said that Mario Kart World has a huge amount of content and they think consumers are willing to pay $80 for it. Most people will probably buy the $500 bundle that includes the Switch 2 and the game, so that breaks the price down to $50.</p>
<p>The price will probably drive a lot of sales of that bundle. They're also doing a lot of these upgrade packs, which I think are a really interesting concept. They're going to use that whole upgrade model to enhance the existing games for the Switch, adding new features and then either sell it for $10 to $20 or give it away if you become an online subscriber, so there's just all kinds of flexibility in the business model.</p>
<p><strong>Do you think that the tariffs could even impact software pricing?</strong></p>
<p>Yes. Obviously, hardware has more of a direct impact, but you do have a lot of issues on the software side. Pricing could increase. Whether the publishers will eat that cost or not remains to be seen. I think it could show up in less discounting on products. One of the great things in the video game business is that you don't have to buy a game on day one; you could wait a while, and the price would come down. You might see an impact on that. I don't think it'll be as great as with hardware, but it definitely could have an impact.</p>
<p><strong>Analysts from Media Research <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-will-be-a-smash-hit-says-analyst-high-retail-prices-are-meant-to-drive-digital-sales/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">thought</a> that part of the reason Mario Kart World was priced at $80 was to drive users toward digital purchases, which are $10 cheaper. Do you agree?</strong></p>
<p>It could be, but I really don't think so. One thing you have to consider when buying digital titles on Nintendo, especially when they're full games like Mario Kart, is it doesn't have a lot of onboard memory to store these games. Clearly, Nintendo is hoping to sell more of its proprietary memory cards. Digital buying on the Switch is growing, but I don't think Nintendo is necessarily trying to drive that any more than would naturally be the case.</p>
<p>They probably realize that people who buy physical copies have a higher price tolerance than people who buy digital games. They want the physical part to decline as much as possible, but at the same time, having a physical presence is still great.</p>
<p><strong>Do you think the Game Chat feature will be a major factor in the success of the Nintendo Switch 2? It seems like they're making a big thing out of it this time around.</strong></p>
<p>Yes. We were talking to all our headset clients and saying, "You got to look at the Nintendo Switch 2 and putting headsets out for that because I think it is going to be pretty big." Having a younger audience, Nintendo has always been a little intimidated by chat and the can of worms that can potentially open. They've taken a slower approach to that, but I think it's clear with what they're doing with the Switch 2 that they're going all in on the chat.</p>
<p>I'm sure they are spending a lot of time ensuring that parental controls and all that good stuff make the chat system robust but also safe. When you're in that business, same with Roblox and other companies that target a younger audience, you have to be very careful in those areas, but the chat is a much-needed feature and I think it'll be extremely appreciated by the audience.</p>
<p><strong>Thank you for your time.</strong></p>

<p>The BAFTA Games Awards 2025 has wrapped, and all the trophies have been handed out. Sitting at the top of the table is Astro Bot, one of 2024’s most popular titles. It claimed no fewer than <strong>five </strong>BAFTA Awards, securing the winning spot in some of the most competitive categories, including the prestigious ‘Best Game’ slot.</p>



<p>It was joined by games like Helldivers 2 and Still Wakes the Deep, both of which landed multiple awards during the show.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-astro-bot-on-top">Astro Bot on Top</h2>



<p>Astro Bot has claimed the BAFTA Awards for some iconic categories:</p>



<ul>
<li>Best Game</li>



<li>Game Design</li>



<li>Family</li>



<li>Audio Achievement</li>



<li>Animation</li>
</ul>



<p>The results at the <a href="https://www.bafta.org/awards/games" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">BAFTA Games Awards</a> in London follow months of similar circumstances for Team Asobi’s wonderful platformer.</p>



<p>Still Wakes the Deep also had a nice spree at the BAFTAs, securing the following wins:</p>



<ul>
<li>New IP</li>



<li>Performer in a Leading Role</li>



<li>Performer in a Supporting Role</li>
</ul>



<p>Still Wakes the Deep was one of my top games of 2024, boasting some intense horror sequences that unfolded during a tense fight for survival aboard a besieged Scottish oil rig. </p>



<p>Helldivers 2 was able to grab the BAFTA Awards for Music and Multiplayer, while Hellblade II landed Technical Achievement. There’s a special nod reserved for Tales of Kenzera: ZAU, which received the BAFTA Award for Game Beyond Entertainment, which given the game’s backstory, is deserved through and through.</p>



<p>To my surprise, Vampire Survivors won Evolving Game, an award that I thought would for sure go to Hello Games and No Man’s Sky. Balatro managed to secure the award for Debut Game, and Thank Goodness You’re Here, the star-studded and bizarre comedy title, won the award for British Game.]</p>



<p>Stay tuned to Insider Gaming, as I was at the BAFTA Games Awards and secured some exclusive interviews with some of the biggest names in gaming.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/diablo-ivs-2025-roadmap-unveiled-new-expansion-in-2026/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/diablo-iv%E2%80%99s-2025-roadmap-unveiled-%E2%80%93-new-expansion-in-2026.1158822/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/diablo-ivs-2025-roadmap-unveiled-new-expansion-in-2026/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Blizzard has announced the roadmap for <a href="https://wccftech.com/diablo-iv-lets-you-claim-boss-powers-for-yourself-next-season-ptr-opens-today/">Diablo IV</a>, as the<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/diablo-iv-vessel-of-hatred-systems-galore/"> Age of Hatred</a> continues for the rest of the year, with the next big expansion for Diablo IV not coming until sometime in 2026.</p>
<p>Diablo IV started 2025 with the current season, <a href="https://wccftech.com/diablo-iv-season-of-witchcraft-adds-the-armory-witchy-powers-and-a-new-storyline-on-the-tree-of-whispers/">Season of Witchcraft</a>, which will come to an end later this month, with the Belial's Return season picking up the baton. Following that will be the Sins of the Horadrim season, and then closing out the year will be the Infernal Chaos season.</p>
<p>Each will bring a new set of limited updates that players can grab before they're gone, along with permanent additions to the game, like new lair bosses coming in the Belail's Return season, and new nightmare dungeon activities in the Sins of the Horadrim season.</p>
<p>The latter will also be when players on consoles will be able to plug in their keyboard and mouse setups, as support for that control scheme on consoles will arrive sometime this summer. There will also be new collaborations with other series in both the Belial's Return season and the Infernal Chaos season, and the former will likely feature a few special add-ons as Blizzard celebrates Diablo IV's two-year anniversary.</p>
<p>Of course, the new expansion that'll be coming in 2026 will be what brings the most change to the game when it arrives next year. The first major expansion for Diablo IV, Vessel of Hatred, arrived a little over a year after the game's original release. This new expansion is spreading that time difference further, so it'll be interesting to see how players react to it once they see how much bigger, or smaller, it is from the last one.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Diablo-IV-2025-Roadmap.png"></a></figure>

<p>For now, Blizzard teases that the new Diablo IV expansion will include leaderboards and a new ranking system. According to the roadmap image Blizzard showed off, that's about all we know about the expansion, which you can check out for yourself above.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/helldivers-2-board-game-fully-funded-in-12-minutes-on-gamefound<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Today, the crowdfunding campaign for the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/helldivers-2-board-game-coming-courtesy-of-steamforged-games" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Helldivers 2 Board Game</em></a> went live. This tabletop adaptation of Arrowhead Studios' satirical sci-fi shooter was an instant success on Gamefound, reaching its funding goal 12 minutes after going live.</p>

<h2>The <em>Helldivers 2 Board Game</em> Gamefound Campaign</h2>

<p>On its official <a href="https://gamefound.com/en/projects/steamforged-games/helldivers-2-board-game" rel="nofollow">campaign page</a>, the <em>Helldivers 2 Board Game</em> brings the fight for managed democracy to gaming tables. Much like the <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/helldivers-2" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Helldivers 2</em></a> videogame, it is a co-op experience for 1-4 players. Players choose one of four classes, mission difficulty, and a planet on which to deploy.</p>

According to the campaign page, a single game takes 120-180 minutes to complete.</p>

<p>The base version of the <em>Helldivers 2 Board Game</em> includes many game pieces and elements that fans expect: damage dice, <em>Helldivers</em> miniatures, stratagem boards, and various status effect tokens. As for enemies, the base game only supports the insectoid Terminid enemies.</p>

<p>Thankfully, developer Steamforged Games included various expansions at different pledge levels and as add-ons. These include the Patriot Exosuit expansion, bringing mech power to the squad, and various boss enemies like the Bile Titan, Factory Strider, and Impaler. Finally, there is an Automatons expansion, bringing the robotic terrors of Malevelon Creek to the game.</p>

<p>There are three pledge levels for the <em>Helldivers 2 Board Game</em>. They are as follows:</p>

<ul><li><strong>Commander Pledge for&nbsp;£61.00:</strong> The base version of the <em>Helldivers 2 Board Game</em>.</li>
	<li><strong>Galactic Commander Pledge for&nbsp;£92.00:</strong> The base game, the Patriot Exosuit expansion, and two mystery expansions set to be announced at a later date.</li>
	<li><strong>Hell Commander Pledge for&nbsp;£246.00:</strong> The base game, Patriot Exosuit, Impaler, Bile Titan, Factory Strider, Automaton, and mystery expansions</li>
</ul><p>In addition, anyone who backs the crowdfunding campaign will receive a Gamefound exclusive <em>Helldivers</em> commemorative turn tracker coin at no additional cost.</p>

<p>At the time of writing, the <em>Helldivers 2 Board Game</em> campaign has raised&nbsp;£383,714, more than six times its initial funding goal of&nbsp;£60,000. The campaign concludes April 22.</p>

<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/diablo-iv">Diablo 4</a> is coming up to its second anniversary but it still has a good bit of gas in the tank. Earlier today <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/blizzard">Blizzard</a> shared its <a href="https://news.blizzard.com/en-us/article/24189529/the-age-of-hatred-persists-diablo-iv-2025-roadmap">roadmap for the game</a> across the rest of the year, though obviously we're a quarter of the way through that already. The game is currently in its seventh season, with its eighth, Belial's Return, starting sometime this month. This one, unsurprisingly, adds Belial, Lord of Lies as a boss, alongside a couple of bosses from Vessel of Hatred as "part of the updated Lair Boss system."
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
This is the part that isn't as fun though: that season will also be bringing in an "IP collab." That's obviously a bit of a red flag, given how much <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/overwatch">Overwatch</a> has fully lent into just ignoring the laws of its own universe with its own crossovers, but the blog post does note that the collab will feature "universes that complement its dark themes." Universes, plural, because season ten, (we'll get there) also features a collab.
</p>
<p>
Season nine, Sins of the Horadrim, starts in July and runs through to September, will bring in new powers, Nightmare dungeon activities, dungeon escalation, and an earnable pet. Aww! Then there's the aforementioned tenth season, which'll include the second collab of the year, as well as new chaos powers and an Infernal Hordes update (oh, and another earnable pet). There'll be some quality of life updates throughout the year too, like the Battle Pass and Seasonal Journey getting a refresh to help them "evolve in ways that are more rewarding."
</p>
<p>
There's no new expansion on the way this year though, with the roadmap noting the next one will be coming in 2026, alongside a new ranking system, leaderboards, and, uh, new something, that bit is obfuscated by some flames. Oops! Blizzard should take a look at that, can't read what's been burned away.

            <p>
Following <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-everything-we-know">Hades 2's appearance in last week's Switch 2 Direct showcase</a>, developer Supergiant Games has confirmed the roguelike sequel will launch for the platform - as well as the original Switch - as a timed console exclusive.
</p>
<p>
Supergiant <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hades-is-getting-a-sequel-the-princess-of-the-underworld-is-heading-our-way">announced a second Hades was in the works</a> at the tail-end of 2022, and it eventually entered PC early access in May last year. It's all change this time around too, with the original game's dashing protagonist Zagreus stepping aside so his sister - Melinoë, Princess of the Underworld - can take the spotlight as she embarks on a quest to defeat Chronos, the Titan of Time. With a little help from the Olympian Gods, of course.
</p>
<p>
Since entering PC early access, Supergiant has steadily expanded and refined <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hades-2">Hades 2</a>, building on the formula that helped its predecessor <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/eurogamers-game-of-the-year-is-hades-and-now-we-chat">earn the title of Eurogamer's Game of the Year in 2020</a>. And, now, following last week's confirmation of a <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-nintendo-direct-everything-announced">Switch 2</a> release, the studio has <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1G3wbCIUVqs">appeared in the latest instalment of Nintendo's new Creator's Voice series</a> to introduce the game to a new audience and confirm - via a quick on-screen message toward the end of the video - that Hades 2's 1.0 release will come to Switch 2 as a timed console exclusive.
</p>
<figure>
<p>
<a aria-label="The God-Like Rogue-Like Returns – Hades II – Creator's Voice | Nintendo Switch 2" data-lightbox="false" data-platform="youtube" href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1G3wbCIUVqs?autoplay=1" onclick="((e) => { e.preventDefault(); e.currentTarget.closest('.video_wrapper').innerHTML = e.currentTarget.querySelector('template').innerHTML; enableElements(); })(event)" title="Click to play video from YouTube">

<template>
<iframe allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1G3wbCIUVqs?autoplay=1" frameborder="0" loading="lazy" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/1G3wbCIUVqs?autoplay=1" title="The God-Like Rogue-Like Returns – Hades II – Creator's Voice | Nintendo Switch 2">
</iframe> </template>
</a>
</p>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1G3wbCIUVqs" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figure>
<p>
That announcement appeared to cause a little bit of confusion, however, and Supergiant <a href="https://x.com/SupergiantGames/status/1909686305342328902">took to social media</a> shortly after to clear up a few details. "Hades 2 v1.0," it wrote, "will launch simultaneously on our Early Access platforms (<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1145350/Hades_II/">Steam</a> and <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/hades-ii">Epic Games Store</a>), Nintendo Switch 2, and the original Nintendo Switch." The only remaining question for now, then, is exactly when 1.0 will show up - but that's still TBA. All Supergiant has said so far is that early access will "continue during 2025", and that it doesn't have a specific end date "at this time".
</p>
<p>
The wait, though, should be worth it. Hades 2 was already looking special when it debuted last year, with Eurogamer contributing editor Christian Donlan <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hades-2-early-access-review">calling it a "game I already love" in his early access review</a>. So expect good for its eventual launch on Switch and Switch 2.

The movie was happening in front of me on a big screen. I could see Jack Black and others dancing about in CG worlds, but the moment it left the screen and entered my eyeballs, it slipped back out of my brain. I had to force myself to absorb and comprehend what was happening. Luckily for me, not much actually happens in this bad movie.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197298" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="108" data-playlist="197298,197284,197260" data-current="197298"><div><p>Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"></video></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p><em>A Minecraft Movie</em> is a (sort of) live-action adaptation of <em>Minecraft</em>. But how do you adapt a video game with no real story or characters into a 100-minute movie? The answer is to lazily make Minecraft another world that real human beings travel to and then eventually leave. Truly, the hallmark of any bad video game movie is when it can be summed up with “Yeah, it’s like that 1980s <em>Mario Bros.</em> movie with Dennis Hopper.”</p><p>But hey, I can stomach a lazy setup if the rest of the movie wins me over. And early on, things were looking good. The first 20 minutes or so of this movie contain some genuinely great jokes that made me and the rest of the theater laugh. We get to meet some of the characters, like the young, awkward Henry and his older sister, Natalie, who has become his mother-figure after their real mom died. The two of them end up in a small town in Idaho because it was their mom’s dying wish. Thanks, mom! As this happens, we are introduced to <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/minecraft-movie-jason-momoa-jack-black-friendship-1851775031&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/minecraft-movie-jason-momoa-jack-black-friendship-1851775031">Jason Momoa’s washed-up video game pro</a></span> who owns a game store and is a huge loser. </p><p>Also, Danielle Brooks is there as Dawn, a character who spends most of the movie doing nothing, saying little, and being wasted. After a fun introduction to the characters, including Jenifer Coolidge’s surprisingly horny and very funny side character Marlene, our four main heroes are zapped into the world of <em>Minecraft</em> and the movie collapses because Jack Black’s Steve becomes a part of the story.</p><p>Can one actor save a movie? Maybe. Can one actor ruin a movie? Yes. And that’s what Jack Black does in <em>A Minecraft Movie</em>. I’m not sure what the hell Jack Black is doing in this movie. I don’t mean why he was cast—he’s a funny, popular dude with a solid track record—but I mean, what is the idea behind his performance in <em>A Minecraft Movie</em>? In fairness to Black, Steve is a nothing character in the game, just the name of its default skin. So he and the writers and director had to basically create Steve’s personality from the ground up. Yet, what they all decided to do was make Steve one of the most annoying characters ever to appear in a movie.</p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/jack-black-minecraft-movie-lapis-lazuli-1851772162&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/jack-black-minecraft-movie-lapis-lazuli-1851772162">Jack Black is dialed up to 12 at all times in this film</a></span>. Every moment Black is on the screen, he is screaming, yelling, dancing, doing weird voices, or using slang. Sometimes, he’s doing all of that at once. It doesn’t work, and within 20 minutes or so of him being a part of the movie, the kids in my theater stopped laughing at his behavior. His performance in<em> A Minecraft Movie</em> is like someone doing an impersonation of Jack Black based entirely on a YouTube compilation of his “Wackiest Moments.” It’s not only annoying and tiring; it’s also not funny. It also makes it hard to connect with Steve, who is one of the main characters in this movie and one of the few with an actual character arc.</p><p>I almost left the movie early when, at one point, Jack Black, readying his newfound friends for battle, says: “We need to mine. We need to craft. <em>We need to Minecraft.</em>” Fuck off. I’ve only got so many hours in my life, and I don’t need them wasted.</p><p>As for what actually happens in <em>A Minecraft Movie</em>, it’s got the most basic plot involving an evil person with no personality or interesting quirks who wants to destroy everything. But to do that, they need a shiny MacGuffin, and guess what? Our intrepid heroes need that same MacGuffin to get back home. Solving this conflict involves an hour of running and walking around CG worlds that look like <em>Minecraft </em>if you installed an ugly, realistic texture pack. Occasionally fights happen or conversations between characters occur, but the movie doesn’t linger on any one part long enough for you to care or develop any attachment to anything.</p><p>Technically, the CG in this movie is impressive. Real characters are perfectly integrated into the digital world. And when a <em>Minecraft </em>character leaves the video game world and enters the real world, he is seamlessly incorporated into the live-action sets. Good stuff. Too bad all the designs are hideous and don’t match up with the actual sound effects ripped from the game, which feel like the filmmakers attempting to remind you that, yes, this is still <em>Minecraft</em>. Promise.</p><figure id="" data-id="aa16d44c391459fe6f58a480f10881fd" data-recommend-id="image://aa16d44c391459fe6f58a480f10881fd" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->WB</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="aa16d44c391459fe6f58a480f10881fd" data-recommend-id="image://aa16d44c391459fe6f58a480f10881fd" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The best part of this movie is a subplot involving Coolidge’s vice principal character, who is newly divorced and falls in love with one of the <em>Minecraft </em>villagers who leaves his world and enters our own. Every single time the movie cut away to show us more of that story, I was disappointed that I wasn’t watching a movie about them instead. It’s also heavily implied that she fucks the villager. Enjoy the movie, kids! (And enjoy that amazing voice cameo at the end. Seriously, I was stunned. Won’t spoil it here. But’s it perfect.)</p><p>Now, I know some will say I’m being too harsh. This is a movie for kids, after all. So what? I’ve seen plenty of good kids movies. <em>The Lego Batman Movie</em> is one of the best DC movies ever made. It’s really funny, has strong character moments, a good plot, and doesn’t lazily dump Lego characters into the real world.</p><p><em>A Minecraft Movie</em> just isn’t very good. Will kids like it? Sure, but generally kids also aren’t the most discerning audience, either, and that’s fine. I’m not saying kids can’t enjoy this movie. I’m just saying it’s a bad movie if you are an adult looking for something funny that doesn’t contain the worst Jack Black performance ever committed to celluloid. I’d recommend people go watch <em>School of Rock</em> and play <em>Minecraft</em> with some buddies instead of watching this crap. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The studio took to Twitter to share the announcement, as well as a picture of 10 perks that protagonist Henry can seemingly inherit:</p><ul><li>Numbskull</li><li>Somnambulant</li><li>Bad Back</li><li>Bashful</li><li>Picky Eater</li><li>Sweaty</li><li>Menace</li><li>Heavy Footed</li><li>Punchable Face</li><li>Hangry Henry</li></ul><p>While their effects haven't been revealed, they all have negative connotations within Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 and will have adverse impacts on Henry as he moves around the world. For example, Picky Eater could mean that Henry might reject certain kinds of food, which can be troublesome when players are trying to refill his hunger meter.</p><p>Like the first game, navigation tools are strictly limited in Hardcore mode. For example, Henry's compass is gone, and his position on the map is no longer shown. Players will have to rely on traditional ways of going from place to place, like looking at surroundings.</p><p>One developer even said that they added an <a href="https://x.com/SirTobi28?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1895203949701144829%7Ctwgr%5Ec0f430aeece823145981c4725ee6c3bf3a7e6515%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.thegamer.com%2Fkingdom-come-deliverance-2-star-map-data-night-sky-navigation-hardcore-mode%2F" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">accurate star map</a> of early summer 1403 and implemented it into the game, which could help players navigate around.</p><p>According to the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-post-launch-roadmap-revealed-including-new-hardcore-mode/1100-6528915/" data-ref-id="1100-6528915">game's roadmap</a>, a paid expansion is due in Summer 2025 with a quest called Brushes With Death, in which Henry goes on a new adventure with a mysterious artist. In Autumn 2025, another paid expansion called Legacy of the Forge sees Henry explore the legacy of his adoptive father, restore Kuttenberg's forge, and become a master blacksmith. The roadmap ends in Winter 2025 with Mysteria Ecclesia, where Henry explore the Sedletz Monastery and goes on a covert mission to stop the spread of a deadly illness.</p>
