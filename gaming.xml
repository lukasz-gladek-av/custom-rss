            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Lost Haven Games has launched a new Kickstarter campaign. The indie creator's latest project is the <em>Skies Above</em> RPG, a tabletop experience inspired by SNES-era RPGs, set in a lively, optimistic world of distant clouds.</p>

<h2>The <em>Skies Above</em> RPG Kickstarter</h2>

<p>In its campaign page, the <em>Skies Above</em> RPG draws heavy inspiration from classic JRPGs, citing icons like <em>Final Fantasy</em> and <em>Dragon Quest</em> alongside the likes of the <em>Grandia</em> and <em>Lunar</em> series. The game's world is set in a post-apocalyptic sky, but eschews the dark and dreary tone. Instead, it presents a world full of vitality, intrigue, and abundance. Its core gameplay centers on exploding d8s.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/skies-above-rpg-skyfolk-artwork.jpg?itok=YuRNTe7S 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/skies-above-rpg-skyfolk-artwork.jpg?itok=3i4vg4X- 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Keeping in line with its inspiration, the game has different playable Skyfolk and twelve jobs to choose from. Skyfolk include the Khoros, bird people that became invaluable in the new world thanks to their ability to fly, and the cat-like Pommo people. The jobs are familiar genre staples like the Monk, Paladin, and Thief, alongside more esoteric choices like the Biomancer and Invoker.</p>

<p>One unique selling point for <em>Skies Above</em> RPG is a crafting and cooking system. Directly referencing the <em>Monster Hunter</em> series and <em>Dungeon Meshi</em>, the game provides rules for turning monster parts into gear and consumables. There are even recipes for various dishes within the monster bestiary. It's a system that helps this game stand out from its peers like <em>Break!!</em> and <em>Fabula Ultima</em>.</p>

<p>This game is the third project by Lost Haven Games. Its founder, Andrew Lever, recently made waves with his last project, the award-nominated TTRPG, <em>Abbadon: The Thirteen Seals</em>. A dark fantasy game, inspired by <em>Diablo</em> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/darkest-dungeon-2-kingdoms-update-inhuman-bondage-release-date" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Darkest Dungeon</em></a>, where character actions are resolved with a standard 54-card deck.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The different pledge tiers for the <em>Skies Above</em> RPG are as follows:</p>

<ul><li><strong>Sky Explorer for $21:</strong> A PDF copy of the game and digital stretch goals</li>
	<li><strong>Sky Adventurer for $54:</strong> A physical, hardcover copy of the game, a PDF, and both physical and digital stretch goals</li>
	<li><strong>Sky Legend for $126:</strong>&nbsp; Everything in the Sky Adventurer tier, a custom D8, a cover art print, a custom art card sketch, and a Frog Knight pin.</li>
</ul><p>At the time of writing, the <em>Skies Above</em> RPG is sitting at&nbsp;<span><span>$3,397, which is close to half of its initial funding goal of $8.072. The campaign concludes October 2.</span></span></p>

            <link>https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/09/civilization-vii-team-at-firaxis-games-faces-layoffs/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/civilization-vii-team-at-firaxis-games-faces-layoffs.1290294/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
          
          
<p>However, it's important to note that neither of those metrics gives as complete a picture as some Internet discussions suggest they do; <em>Civilization VII</em> launched on other platforms and game stores like the PlayStation 5, Xbox, Nintendo Switch, and Epic Game Store, and those wouldn't be captured in Steam numbers—even though it intuitively seems likely that Steam would account for the significant majority of players for this particular franchise. Twitch viewership is also not necessarily representative of sales or the number of players.</p>
<p>It's also difficult to know for sure whether the layoffs are tied to the game's performance.</p>
<p>Just a month ago, Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/take-two-ceo-strauss-zelnick-insists-projections-for-the-lifetime-value-of-civilization-7-are-very-consistent-with-our-initial-expectations-for-the-title-despite-slow-start">said</a> that while the game had a "slow start," he believes "Civ has always been a slow burn." He said the projections for the "lifetime value of the title" are consistent with the company's initial projections.</p>
<p>There have been numerous other examples of studios and publishers laying off staff from teams that worked on both successful and unsuccessful releases as the industry continues to roll back pandemic-era over-hiring and respond to inflation, rising borrowing costs, global economic instability, trade uncertainty, ballooning development costs, and efficiency pressures.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Borderlands 4 | Official Launch Week Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>Borderlands 4 will cost $70 when it launches, which is notable because there was a period of time when Gearbox boss Randy Pitchford claimed he did not know the price, prompting fears that it could be $80. Pitchford stoked the conversation around pricing by saying <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4-boss-says-he-didnt-mean-to-trigger-people-with-comments-on-the-price/1100-6531910/" data-ref-id="1100-6531910">"real fans" would find a way to come up with $80 if that was the case.</a></p><p>Pitchford is so confident in Borderlands 4's pricing strategy that he recently said he <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4-would-still-be-worth-it-at-5x-the-price-gearbox-boss-says/1100-6534143/" data-ref-id="1100-6534143">believes the game would be "worth it" at five times the price of entry.</a></p><p>While the standard edition is priced at $70, 2K and Gearbox are offering multiple more expensive editions of the game, including a $100 deluxe edition, a $130 super deluxe edition, and a $150 collector's edition.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Many, many RPG fans are patiently awaiting the <a href="https://kotaku.com/kingdom-hearts-iv-4-square-enix-disney-announced-reveal-1848774720">next installment in the <em>Kingdom Hearts</em> franchise</a>. And a lot of those people are waiting for <em>Final Fantasy VII Remake</em>‘s third and final installment, too. As you might expect, some are worried about how development is proceeding on these two massive Square Enix RPGs, and to help calm those players down, <em>FF7</em> and <em>KH4</em> director Tetsuya Nomura has attempted to reassure us all that things are going “smoothly.”</p> <p><a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2025/09/final-fantasy-vii-remake-part-three-and-kingdom-hearts-iv-development-progressing-smoothly-tetsuya-nomura-confirms">As reported by <em>Gematsu</em></a>, during Friday’s <em>Final Fantasy VII: Ever Crisis </em>2nd Anniversary broadcast, Nomura hopped in toward the end after seemingly spotting comments in the chat asking about <em>FF7 Remake’s</em> third installment. While he didn’t have a release date to share, he wanted everyone to relax. The game is on schedule, okay?</p>  <div data-qa="virtual-list-item" role="listitem" aria-roledescription="message" data-qa-hover="true" data-qa-unprocessed="false" data-qa-placeholder="false" id="C099JF8RR7T-1757093613.501129-thread-list-Thread_1757093654.334059" tabindex="0" aria-setsize="-1" data-item-key="1757093654.334059"> <div dir="auto"> <p>“Right, so, looking at the comments, I’m seeing people ask every so often about the third entry in the [<i data-stringify-type="italic">FF7</i>]&nbsp;<i data-stringify-type="italic">Remake</i> series,” said Nomura. “Apparently, [<em>FF7</em> co-director Motomu] Toriyama mentioned in an interview that something might be released around the second anniversary [of <i data-stringify-type="italic">Ever Crisis</i>]. So that’s probably where those expectations are coming from. Right, so things are progressing really smoothly. I can’t really say more—if I suddenly went, ‘Well, actually…,’ everyone would be really surprised!”</p> </div>  <div dir="auto"> <p>He then added: “So yeah, things are moving along really smoothly, and the release timing has already been decided. We’re moving forward according to that schedule right now, so please rest assured and be patient.”</p> </div> </div>  <p>And don’t worry, fans of <em>Kingdom Hearts</em>, Nomura also had a small update about the Disney RPG, which was first announced back in 2022.</p>  <p>“And this has also come up in the comments here and there, but <i data-stringify-type="italic">Kingdom Hearts IV</i>&nbsp;is likewise steadily moving forward according to schedule, so please look forward to it.”</p>  <p>While this is good to hear, I imagine a lot of folks want a release window for one or both of these RPGs. <em>FF7 Remake’</em>s third entry will be its last, <a href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-ff7-vii-remake-trilogy-rebirth-square-eni-1849074004">as confirmed by Square Enix in 2022</a>. We still don’t know when it’s coming, what it will be named, and what platforms it will launch on, though I expect PS5 players will be able to play it day one. Meanwhile, we’ve heard very little about <em>Kingdom Hearts 4</em>, though we did get <a href="https://kotaku.com/kingdom-hearts-4-screenshots-mickey-sora-release-date-1851780809">a new, very low-res screenshot earlier this year of Mickey Mouse in a library.</a> Hopefully, that and Nomura’s assurance that everything is progressing as planned will be enough for folks until the next update.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/fans-are-trying-to-crack-a-cryptic-unlisted-cyberpunk-2077-video.1290258/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><i>Cyberpunk 2077</i> isn’t without its unsolved mysteries. Between the seemingly <a href="https://kotaku.com/cyberpunk-2077-ff06b5-statue-code-mystery-netflix-anime-1849732254">unsolved FF06B5 enigma</a> and the lasting impact of <a href="https://kotaku.com/cyberpunk-2077-peralez-quest-jefferson-dream-on-choice-1849787559">cryptic quests like the Peralez storyline</a>, plenty of cybersleuths are still hard at work on the streets of Night City trying to uncover the game’s secrets. Fittingly, A recent social media post by official <i>Cyberpunk</i> accounts has led fans on another strange quest for truth, and it centers a strange, unlisted video that, at first glance, looks to be just 24 minutes of uninterrupted static.</p> <p>On September 1, 2025, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/cyberpunk.net/post/3lxrrdgn3w22h">CD Projekt Red shared an image</a> of an in-universe recruitment message from Rosalind Myers, president of <i>Cyberpunk</i>’s fictional NUSA (New United States of America). Over at the decaying corpse of Twitter known as X, the official <i>Cyberpunk 2077</i> account <a href="https://x.com/CyberpunkGame/status/1962930885935714594">threw cold water</a> on any notion that this post was a teaser for new content, clarifying that it was simply “part of an activity tied to the <i>Phantom Liberty</i> anniversary [the studio’s] celebrating this month.” But fans convinced there was something more to this message were on to something.</p>   <p>As documented by ArcticXWolf on Reddit, the binary of the image had a link that <a href="https://cyberpunk.cdn.cdpr.app/files/wigvixQWK.png">points to an image of a Roman coin</a>. Using the anonymous messaging platform secretMSG, the link redirects to the unlisted YouTube video mentioned earlier,&nbsp; titled “Secret Message from NUSA,” which seemingly contains nothing more than 24 minutes and 53 seconds of static. Despite my affinity for avant-garde works of art, even I don’t think it’s very pleasant to listen to.</p>

  <p>Things get a little weird from here on out. Select frames from this video can be seen to spell out the words “FILES DETECTED CLASSIFIED.” Unfortunately, this seems to be the last concrete, provable thing anyone’s sussed out thus far. Some have <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FF06B5/comments/1n93v8f/a_secret_message_from_the_nusa_static_video_isnt/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">turned to LLMs for help</a>–which (shocker!) isn’t turning up anything meaningful. Others have pointed to a possible similarity between this cryptic static video and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FF06B5/comments/1n7skjz/comment/nc9wcza/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">something apparently hidden</a> in <a href="https://kotaku.com/cyberpunk-edgerunners-season-2-netflix-studio-trigger-1851785703">the <i>Edgerunners 2</i> teaser</a>, which may or may not have something to do with <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FF06B5/comments/1n7skjz/comment/nca6b2h/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button"><i>Cyberpunk</i>’s space-exploration-themed conspiracies</a>. And yet another well-read fan <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FF06B5/comments/1n8azmn/comment/nce1a8u/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">quoted the opening line</a> of William Gibson’s classic cyberpunk novel <i>Neuromancer</i>:</p> <blockquote><p>“The sky above the port was the color of television, tuned to a dead channel.”</p></blockquote> <p>Spooky stuff! The cryptic video remains unlisted and no social media accounts from <i>Cyberpunk 2077</i> or CD Projekt Red actually seem to have given any more clues. <i>Cyberpunk 2077</i>’s stories are often at their best when there’s a mystery to unravel, so this is cool and on-brand. Now hopefully someone figures this one out, as well as whatever the hell the true meaning of FF06B5 is.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/hollow-knight-silksong-steam-review-bomb-chinese-translation-2000623496</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/here%E2%80%99s-why-hollow-knight-silksong-is-getting-review-bombed-in-china.1290255/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em> <a href="https://kotaku.com/hollow-knight-silksong-hits-over-half-a-million-players-on-pc-alone-after-crashing-steam-2000623193">is soaring on Steam</a>. Just 24 hours after release it’s taken over the sales charts, hit a concurrent player peak of over 550,000, and received rave reviews from fans. But not in China. The long-awaited Metroidvania has instead been getting review-bombed by Chinese-language users on Steam who feel the translation this time around is much worse than that in the first <em>Hollow Knight</em>. The head of marketing for the game has already promised to put things right.</p> <p>“To our Chinese speaking fans: We appreciate you letting us know about quality issues with the current Simplified Chinese translation of <em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em>,” Matthew Griffin, in charge of publishing for the game, <a href="https://x.com/griffinmatta/status/1963798473700168146">wrote on X</a>. “We’ll be working to improve the translation over the coming weeks. Thanks for your feedback and support.” Despite the good news, his post has been inundated with comments and quote-tweets, many slamming the fact that the game launched without better quality checks for the Chinese localization.</p> <p>According to localization expert Loek van Kooten, one of the main issues is that <em>Silksong</em>‘s evocative but concise writing has been turned into “a high-school drama club’s Elizabethan improv night” in the Chinese versions. He cites the following as an example of how the prose reads:</p>

 <blockquote><p>With nary a spirit nor thought shalt thou persist, bereft of mortal will, unbent, unswayed. With no lament nor tearful cry, only sorrow’s dirge to herald thine eternal woe. Born of gods and of the fathomless abyss, grasping heaven’s firmament in thine unworthy palm. Shackled to endless dream, tormented by pestilence and shadow, thy heart besieged by phantasmal demons. Thou art the chalice of destiny. Verily, thou art the Primordial Knight of Hollowness.</p></blockquote> <p>Van Kooten goes on to point out that one of two of <em>Silksong</em>‘s Chinese translators, listed as Hertzz Liu in the credits, had a habit of gloating about their involvement in the game and leaking small details about the development process over the summer prior to its release this week. The first <em>Hollow Knight</em>, on the other hand, <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/game/84194/hollow-knight/credits/windows/?autoplatform=true">had six Chinese translators</a>,&nbsp; including one who had also worked on<em> Stardew Valley</em>.</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">no,you don't hate localizer enough. we need translator,not a fanfic writer that doesn't convey author's original intention,the whole localization industry is a scam <a href="https://t.co/5Q8fBB6UiH">https://t.co/5Q8fBB6UiH</a></p> <p>— NKRZE (@nekorize) <a href="https://twitter.com/nekorize/status/1964020916683493687?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 5, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>Here’s a Valve-translated portion of one Steam review blasting the Chinese verison:</p>

 <blockquote><p>First, the god-awful Chinese translation that everyone is mocking. It’s not just pretentious, pseudo-artistic nonsense—the phrasing and even the localization of place names are an absolute mess. I don’t understand how Hollow Knight’s fantastic, quotable translation turned into this unsalvageable heap of garbage in Silksong. The utterly idiotic localization has even affected the game’s world-building and storytelling, forcing me to guess at character relationships and main plot points. Thankfully, the combat holds up, or else I’d be completely disgusted.</p></blockquote> <p><em>Silksong</em> currently sits at a staggeringly low rating of just 50 percent out of 10,000 reviews in the simplified Chinese category. That would be enough to significantly stunt the game’s Steam rating worldwide, at least in the short-term, <a href="https://kotaku.com/steam-reviews-wuchang-fallen-feather-china-language-filter-2000618249">had Valve not implemented a recent change</a> that segments Steam reviews by language for exactly this reason. Now review-bombing in one country for region-specific issues doesn’t bleed over into a game’s overall perception globally.</p> <p>Unlike when <em>Hollow Knight</em> released eight years ago, Chinese language users <a href="https://newsletter.gamediscover.co/p/4-great-graphs-and-1-new-feature">now make up the largest group on Steam</a>. While poor translations don’t hurt a game for anyone who’s not reliant on them, they can limit a game’s trajectory on the Valve-owned storefront. Somehow I ultimately don’t think that will be a problem for <em>Silksong</em>, especially once Team Cherry gets the Chinese translation sorted.</p>

                <p>XP has been a regular topic of conversation among <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fortnite/" data-ref-id="5000-125765">Fortnite</a> players during Chapter 6 Season 4, as Epic Games has <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-xp-gains-are-reportedly-slower-in-chapter-6-season-4/1100-6533768/" data-ref-id="1100-6533768">apparently slashed how quickly most folks will level up</a> just by playing normally. Since this season is a month longer than last season was, it's not a particularly surprising change. Fortunately, Fortnite is easing the burden a bit by offering double XP all weekend. The boost will last until Monday, September 8 at 6 AM PT / 9 AM ET.</p><p>Double XP weekends aren't a very common thing in Fortnite. Typically, when Epic wants to help players gain XP faster, it adds limited-time event quests with simple objectives that are easy to complete in Battle Royale, Reload, or whatever other mode the company wants to promote. Fortnite's most recent double XP weekend event like this one happened back in March.</p><p>The double XP is only one of the things Epic changed for this weekend. Blitz Royale is having a Golden Llamageddon event, where the map will be filled with special gold llama pinatas full of top-tier loot. And in Battle Royale, they've unvaulted several old weapons, including the grapple glove, the Boom Bow, the original pump shotgun, and the beloved Holo Twister rifle that was everybody's favorite gun during the first two seasons of Chapter 6.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4562859-hollowtitty.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4562859" data-ratio="0.51230769230769" data-width="1300" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4562859-hollowtitty.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4562859"></a><figcaption>The Holo Twister assault rifle is back in Battle Royale this weekend.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4562859-hollowtitty.jpg"></figure><p>And over in Fortnite OG, the path is diverging from how it went in Chapter 1 Season 5 the first time, with the giant purple cube Kevin from back in the day being replaced by the giant red cube Revin.</p><p>All these shenanigans are likely to come to an end at the same time double XP does on Monday, so there's only a limited amount of time to take part before things go back to normal.</p>

The developer discussed some of the movement changes coming to Call of Duty in Black Ops 7 as well as teased more remastered maps from 2012's Black Ops 2.</p><p dir="ltr">A lot of popular Call of Duty maps have been remastered over the years, and Black Ops 7 is already confirmed to have three at launch. Raid, Hijacked, and Express return this year, but they've all been remastered in previous Black Ops games, leaving fans eager for different maps to appear.</p><p dir="ltr">When asked if players can get some Black Ops 2 remasters that have never been seen before, Treyarch design director Matt Scronce simply answered, "Yes, you can."</p><p dir="ltr">Maps like Yemen and Plaza have been highly requested over the years, so hopefully these locations will finally return to Call of Duty as remastered maps in Black Ops 7.</p><p dir="ltr">Scronce also discussed the movement for Black Ops 7 multiplayer. The developer re-confirmed that Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 doesn't feature jet packs or wall-running mechanics. Instead, the game includes redefined omnimovement with a wall-jump ability, which can be chained together for up to three jumps.</p><p dir="ltr">"On that second and third jump, you're going to lose a little bit of momentum," Scronce explained. "We honestly want to make sure people aren't ping ponging around the maps."</p><p dir="ltr">Activision recently revealed that the previously announced <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-will-no-longer-include-black-ops-6-operators-skins-and-weapons/1100-6534278/">Carry Forward program for Black Ops 7 has been cancelled</a>, mostly. Weapons, operator skins, and other cosmetics from Black Ops 6 will no longer transfer to Black Ops 7.

			<p>Onimusha: Way of the Sword's <a href="https://wccftech.com/onimusha-way-of-the-sword-announced-for-pc-and-consoles-with-a-2026-release-date/">announcement </a>was one of the highlights of last year's The Game Awards show, even though it wasn't exactly a surprise since there had been a few indications before the reveal that CAPCOM was planning to bring the series back in some form. No matter how loved the series was during its PlayStation 2 days, however, there's no denying the franchise was going to face some challenges in the modern video games market, where the soulslike genre has become the predominant formula for action RPGs, a genre the series could easily fall into by shedding away the gameplay elements inspired by the Resident Evil series. Thankfully, Onimusha: Way of the Sword is not heading this way, as the game will stay very true to the series' roots while providing a modern gameplay experience that is sure to make it stand out as a rather unique experience.</p>



<p>During Gamescom last month, I had the chance to try out a playable demo of the game lasting around 30 minutes. Though short, and a little rough around the edges, which is making me wonder if the game is a little further from release than the way more polished <a href="https://wccftech.com/pragmata-gamescom-hands-on-preview-an-unexpected-surprise/">PRAGMATA</a>, this demo did an excellent job showcasing how Onimusha: Way of the Sword will feature a modernized take of the series' classic formula. Controlling Miyamoto Musashi as he searches the iconic Kiyomizu-dera temple for the source of the Malice that has gripped the temple, I was able to appreciate not only the incredibly atmospheric rendition of the temple, but also the gameplay mechanics, which will set the game apart from other similar games combining a historical Japanese setting with fantasy elements. </p>



<figure><figcaption><em>Onimusha: Way of the Sword is set to be a more than worthy entry in the series</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Although Onimusha: Way of the Sword does away with the fixed camera angles of most of its predecessors, controlling Musashi felt instantly familiar, with some camera angles mirroring some of the series' typical angles, but with increased dynamism. Similarly, combat also felt pretty familiar and unmistakably Onimusha, with a focus on staggering Genma demons, parrying their attacks and eliminating them with one-hit Issen counterattacks. In just a few minutes, I instantly felt at home navigating the temple, solving some simple puzzles, and absorbing wandering souls using the Oni Gauntlet to power up weapons and enable special techniques, which both felt rather varied in the demo despite the limited selection.</p>



<p>After exploring the moderately intricate temple for a few minutes, I was confronted by Sasaki Ganryu, a character clearly based on some of the most popular representations of Kojiro Sasaki, the most famous of Musashi's rivals in real history. The battle that followed was rather cinematic, and watching Musashi and Sasaki Ganryu trade blows was a true spectacle, if not a little too easy, as parrying his attacks was far from difficult. As the game is likely still far from release, I am not too worried about game balance, although I don't expect the game to be a massive challenge, as CAPCOM already confirmed it is not <a href="https://wccftech.com/onimusha-way-of-the-sword-is-a-linear-game-that-wont-place-too-much-focus-on-difficulty/">focusing on difficulty.</a></p>



<p>Back when Onimusha: Way of the Sword's gameplay was finally shown, I wasn't particularly keen on what looked like a slow and clunky experience, but playing the Gamescom demo completely dispelled any doubt I may have had about the game. If the final release holds to the quality level showcased in the demo, Onimusha: Way of the Sword will undoubtedly be the revival the classic action-adventure series deserved after years of complete silence. Hopefully, it will make its way on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S before the end of 2026, as announced.</p>

All the basics are recreated, of course, like the general layout of the office and the desks. The downstairs warehouse is there, too.</p><p>But this user-created space really shines with the finer points, like two chairs on the roof to signify where Jim and Pam watched fireworks together, along with the snowman-like sculptures in the parking lot where Jim was terrorized by Dwight.</p><p>It also includes a radar speed sign outside and multiple people standing around it, mirroring that time Michael ran a humanly impossible 31 mph. These smaller details aren't in the flyover video embedded below, but can be found in the creation itself and shared by the creator in comments posted on Reddit.</p><p>This is just the latest example of the immense creativity of No Man's Sky players, and you don't have to look hard to find more. Game creator Sean Murray highlighted some of his favorite No Man's Sky custom ship builds this week, including <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/no-mans-sky-players-are-going-wild-with-the-new-ship-builder/1100-6534464/" data-ref-id="1100-6534464">a ship modeled after Thomas the Tank engine and even himself.</a></p><p>As for The Office, the show's spin-off series The Paper is out now on Peacock. The show follows the same in-universe documentary crew that made The Office, but this time they're making a documentary about a struggling newspaper and the efforts to revitalize it. The show stars Domhnall Gleeson and Sabrina Impacciatore, all episodes are out now, and a second season has already been ordered.</p><div data-embed-type="html"><p><i>Click the button below to add GameSpot as a preferred source on Google</i></p></div>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>MindsEye, the game from Build a Rocket Boy that had an <a href="https://wccftech.com/mindseye-developer-build-a-rocket-boy-heartbroken-over-the-games-launch-details-patches-coming-throughout-june/">abysmal launch</a> and is still listed as the worst-reviewed game of 2025 on <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/browse/game/all/all/current-year/metascore/?page=13">Metacritic</a>, just got its latest update following <a href="https://wccftech.com/mindseye-developer-reportedly-beginning-mass-layoff-process-potentially-impacting-over-100-employees/">layoffs at the studio</a> and reports that its launch went so poorly, its publisher <a href="https://wccftech.com/mindseye-disastrous-launch-io-ionteractive-publishing/">IO Interactive is reconsidering its entire publishing branch</a>.</p>



<p>2023 had Lord of the Rings: Gollum, 2024 had the likes of South Park: Snow Day and Funko Fusion, and 2025 has MindsEye. Other games could join it of course, but Rockstar veteran Leslie Benzies' Build a Rocket Boy studio is "<em>committed to refining MindsEye</em>," in the hopes that it will one day not belong next to the games mentioned above.</p>



<p>"<em>Update 4 introduces a range of UX improvements, numerous performance enhancements to the game and we’ve squashed a load of bugs,</em>" Build a Rocket Boy's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3265250/view/506213027443377972?l=english">update on the game's Steam page reads</a>. "<em>These efforts will continue in Update 5, where our team is working hard to deliver a major performance, combat and Enemy AI system improvement.</em>"</p>



<p>"<em>We remain committed to refining MindsEye and enhancing the gameplay experience. Ongoing updates will continue to be shared.</em>"</p>



<p>The full patch notes posted go on to list a huge swath of bug fixes and improvements the update contains for all platforms, but if you've played MindsEye, then you're aware that it'll take more than squashing several bugs to fix this game's issues.</p>



<p>We'll see if Build a Rocket Boy is able to carry on updating the game, or if it'll run out of road to get the job done, and MindsEye becomes Build a Rocket Boy's first and last major release.</p>

What makes this set even more exciting is its size , about 90 cards before secret rares, which makes it the smallest English set in nearly a decade. For collectors like me, that usually means a much more manageable chase, while still packing in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-biggest-pokemon-card-crashers-and-climbers-this-week-august-28">plenty of heavy hitters</a> for players.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The product lineup looks pretty stacked too. We’ll be getting the usual booster packs and booster box (36 packs), a 9-pack Elite Trainer Box featuring a shiny new Charcadet promo, and an Ultra-Premium Collection built around Mega Charizard X ex. On top of that, two theme decks for Mega Gengar ex and Mega Diancie ex are arriving a few weeks early on October 24, which is a fun way to get a taste of the set before launch. If you’re like me and love cracking packs, the booster box is the way to go, but the UPC is already looking like the big collector piece this time around.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">What ties it all together is the <a href="https://zdcs.link/ao6bvY?object_uuid=97d94ead-e156-41ee-a9fa-29018626708d&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Japanese set Inferno X</a>, which hit shelves there in late September. That set had only 80 cards, and once you add in the Mega Gengar and Mega Diancie decks, you basically get the full Phantasmal Flames lineup. We’ve already seen some killer reveals, including the Mega Charizard X ex secret rare previewed at Worlds, so I’m fully expecting that to be the chase card when this launches. Between the smaller set size, Charizard hype, and some solid gameplay cards, I think this one’s going to fly off shelves and I’m definitely locking in my preorder.</p><p id="back-to-the-future-steelbooks"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Back To The Future Steelbooks">Back To The Future Steelbook Preorders Are Live</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">The 40th anniversary Back to the Future steelbooks are a collector’s dream.

Its Phantom Gate attack let it copy any move from the opponent’s Active Pokémon, a flexible strategy that earned it lasting fan love. The secret rare gold trim adds collector prestige, making this one of the most desirable Megas not named Rayquaza.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Also climbing fast is <a href="https://zdcs.link/911JRq?object_uuid=bf0c9736-6c66-4dde-9f6e-79d4aeaf0dd0&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">M Rayquaza EX (Full Art – Roaring Skies)</a>, now at $656.93 compared to $164.04 in January. Its Delta Evolution rule bypassed the usual Mega Evolution turn-ending drawback, giving it unique competitive edge at release. The vibrant green artwork adds to its desirability, and while overshadowed by the Shiny Rayquaza, it’s carving its own path upward.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://zdcs.link/9wjLYq?object_uuid=bf0c9736-6c66-4dde-9f6e-79d4aeaf0dd0&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">M Charizard EX (X – Flashfire)</a> has also doubled and then some, climbing from $126.89 to $349.99. Though its Wild Blaze attack forced players to discard five cards after dealing 300 damage, the Mega X design remains one of Charizard’s most iconic forms. Collectors chasing Charizard cards across eras are pushing this one higher.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Finally, <a href="https://zdcs.link/a5XJ2L?object_uuid=bf0c9736-6c66-4dde-9f6e-79d4aeaf0dd0&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Primal Groudon EX (Shiny Full Art – Ancient Origins)</a> has jumped from $126.89 in January to $349.99 today.

Its Psychic Infinity attack scaled with Energy on both Active Pokémon, giving it offensive versatility. While its growth has slowed compared to Rayquaza and Gengar, this plateau is a clear chance to lock in before it spikes again with the Mega Evolution revival.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://zdcs.link/aDrYDN?object_uuid=bf0c9736-6c66-4dde-9f6e-79d4aeaf0dd0&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">M Alakazam EX (Full Art – Fates Collide)</a> has climbed from $28.85 to $99.97 but has now steadied in the $90–100 range. Its Zen Force attack synergized well with spread-damage strategies, though it never became a meta staple. Collectors have kept it relevant, and with prices flatlining, this looks like a buy-and-hold card heading into Pokémon Legends Z-A.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://zdcs.link/aM8dE4?object_uuid=bf0c9736-6c66-4dde-9f6e-79d4aeaf0dd0&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">M Charizard EX (Generations)</a> has tripled from $64.66 to $196, but growth has tapered. Its Heat Typhoon coin-flip mechanic made it more of a novelty card, yet the Generations anniversary branding has cemented its long-term collector appeal. With Charizard’s legacy tied tightly to every new era, this plateau may be short-lived.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Finally, <a href="https://zdcs.link/9gjxWG?object_uuid=bf0c9736-6c66-4dde-9f6e-79d4aeaf0dd0&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">M Charizard EX (Full Art – Evolutions)</a> mirrors its Generations counterpart, rising from $64.66 to $196 but settling into that range. The Crimson Dive attack packed 300 damage at the cost of self-harm, which limited competitive use, but Evolutions nostalgia has carried it. With the Mega Evolution resurgence on the horizon, this lull feels like a rare buying opportunity before Charizard prices inevitably rise again.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Christian Wait is a contributing freelancer for IGN covering everything collectable and deals.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Hollow Knight: Silksong may be the sequel to Hollow Knight, but players are quickly finding out that it doesn't exactly play the same way Hollow Knight did. With a new protagonist and new moves, the controls and abilities available might have some players fumbling or struggling, especially when it comes to Silksong's trickier platforming sections. Fortunately, there's a way to switch back to the Hollow Knight moveset available pretty early on, if you really must.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Warning: This article will contain spoilers for Silksong's early game, including the first two major unlockable abilities and one of the earliest bosses. If you haven't thoroughly explored the Deep Docks area just yet, you may want to wait and come back to this later.</strong></p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Hornet's default moveset is very, very different from that of the Knight in Hollow Knight. She has more range than the Knight, but her Needle swings are just a touch slower. She also is unable to "pogo" off of enemies the same way the Knight was - while he could slash downward to bounce off a foe, Hornet can bounce only by shooting downward at a diagonal 45 degree angle. This makes some of the game's jumping puzzles significantly more tricky until you get used to the new abilities.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While it's my personal recommendation to just practice and get used to Hornet's moveset as the game clearly intends, it's possible that having the Knight's abilities might be a benefit in certain circumstances, or maybe you just want to play that way. For that, you need to get the Wanderer's Crest, which is a different crest with different slots for tools than your default Hunter's Crest.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The Wanderer's Crest has a few requirements to unlock: you need to have beaten the Bell Beast and unlocked Hornet's sprint ability found in Deep Docks. You'll also need to have a Simple Key with you, which can be acquired easily from the merchant in Bone Bottom. If you've already bought and used that key, you'll have to find one elsewhere.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">With key in hand, head up into Mosshome, and head west as far as possible. Once you get to the elevator room (the one that takes you back down to Bone Bottom), use your dash to cross the big gap, and keep heading west into the Wormways. Progress through the Wormways westward and down to a hut where the crest is waiting for you. Our video above has a far more detailed explanation of how to get this item.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Wanderer's Crest does make it a bit harder to fight enemies, especially at range, but can make exploration easier, so just be warned. You can swap it out any time at a bench, and experiment with both crests and figure out which one works for you. We're just getting started with Silksong, so who knows, maybe there will be even more crests out there with cool new abilities waiting for us to find them!</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Hollow Knight: Silksong is out now, and we're <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/hollow-knight-silksong">hard at work on our Wiki guides</a> of everything you might possibly want to know as you start your adventures in Pharloom. We've also got a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hollow-knight-silksong-review">review-in-progress covering our thoughts so far</a> that we'll update with a score as soon as we've finished the game.

      A video shows how different storage media can affect <em>Mario Kart World</em> load times.

          </p>

<p>CD Projekt Red VP of Technology Charles Tremblay has alluded to this same challenge when talking about the Switch 2 port of <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>. In <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g42TZdesZvY">a June interview with IGN</a>, Tremblay said the data transfer speeds enabled by MicroSD Express were "great," while streaming data from a Switch 2 Game Card was merely "okay." Tremblay did go on to say that "all the performance we have on [input/output] is very good on [the Switch 2]," especially compared to the extremely slow physical hard drives that <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/01/cdpr-ceo-blames-in-game-streaming-for-cyberpunks-console-problems/">plagued <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>'s performance on older hardware</a>.</p>
<h2>Slow down, you move too fast</h2>
<p>From the outside, it's a bit odd that Nintendo allowed this loading-speed dichotomy to exist on the Switch 2 in the first place. On the original Switch, read speeds for both SD cards and Game Cards <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Switch/comments/1jsl1u2/if_the_switch_2_game_cartridge_is_slower_than/">reportedly maxed out around 90 MB/s</a>. But when designing the new Switch 2 game cards, Nintendo settled on a format that would stream data much more slowly than for downloaded games on the same console.</p>
<p>That decision might have been an attempt to minimize hardware costs for the Switch 2's Game Card interface. If so, though, it doesn't seem to have done much to reduce the costs of manufacturing Switch 2 game cards themselves. The cost of manufacturing those physical Game Cards has been <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/switch-2-publishers-quietly-step-away-from-real-physical-game-carts-opinion">frequently cited</a> as a major reason many publishers are using cheaper Game Key Cards in the first place, though <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:l45oa4c3p2ndptazexy33q3z/post/3lxzsvi6s7c2e">Bantin</a> said that he "[didn't] recall the cost of the cards ever entering the discussion [for <em>Star Wars: Outlaws</em>]—probably because it was moot."</p>
<p>Nintendo could get around this variable loading speed issue by letting players pre-install games from a Switch 2 Game Card to internal or expansion storage, as Microsoft and Sony have either <a href="https://arstechnica.com/civis/threads/ps3-games-to-offer-install-option.263753/">allowed</a> or <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2013/11/xbox-one-review-more-than-a-game-console-less-than-a-living-room-revolution/">required</a> on their disc-based consoles for decades now. But that solution might prove onerous for physical game card players who want to avoid clogging up the limited 256GB of internal storage on the Switch 2 (and/or avoid investing in pricey MicroSD Express cards).</p>
<p>As time goes on, many developers will likely learn how to adapt to and tolerate the Switch 2's relatively slow Game Card interface. But as gamers and the industry at large <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2022/02/fewer-and-fewer-console-games-are-seeing-a-physical-release/">continue</a> to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/05/alan-wake-2-and-the-death-of-disc-based-video-games/">transition</a> away <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/09/too-much-of-a-good-thing-mourning-the-slow-death-of-the-retail-game-store/">from physical media</a>, some developers might decide it's not worth compromising on loading speeds just to satisfy a shrinking portion of the market.</p>

<section><p>And Roger isn't very accessible, but maybe that's the point.</p></section>
        
        
                    
              <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p dir="ltr">How does one properly deal with grief? The grief of recollecting beautiful memories, knowing they can never return. The grief of watching the life you built for yourself drastically slip away. The grief of seeing a loved one lose themselves to dementia. I've lived these moments. The pain of watching my grandfather, the kindest and gentlest man in my life, lose his entire personality and identity to dementia. The worst part is arguably watching the disease progress, seeing him lose more and more every year. Yet, throughout these powerful and intense moments of grief, love shines through in every scenario. This is the excellence of And Roger, a visual novel that swept me away with its brilliant gameplay and masterful storytelling, and for the first time in my life, made me reconsider how I critique inaccessibility.</p><p dir="ltr"><em><strong>Spoilers for And Roger to follow.</strong></em></p><p dir="ltr">Developed by TearyHand Studio, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/and-roger/" data-ref-id="5000-654160">And Roger</a> follows a couple as the wife, Sofia, progressively loses herself to dementia. The hour-long game, composed of three chapters, recounts moments throughout Sofia's life, particularly those associated with her husband, Roger. Players see the evolution of the couple's life together, performing varying quick-time events to progress the story. Yet, with each loving and tender core memory, the shadows of Sofia's disability continuously lurk.</p><p dir="ltr">But I'm not here to explore the emotional depth of one of the most powerful games I've ever played. Rather, I want to explore something that continually struck me as I completed each minigame: how a lack of accessibility, ultimately leading me to struggle, made the story much more impactful. The power of this short experience was so great that it made me reflect on my own beliefs and journalistic practices as both a disability reporter and disabled gamer. How I view accessibility will forever be changed because of this game.</p><h2 dir="ltr"><strong>Love and quick time events</strong></h2><p dir="ltr">And Roger begins with Sofia as a small child, struggling to wake herself. She tells herself she's exhausted and dizzy--that her body feels abnormally heavy. The music during this sequence is haunting and made me feel uneasy, as if I were about to enter a horror game. Instead, I found myself thrown into the game's first QTE, which required me to rapidly press a white button to sit Sofia up. Like Sofia, I struggled immensely to click the button on the screen. With every slip, she would fall back into her bed, forcing me to start over. And after completing the task, I felt drained, barely able to move my hand across the mouse. My stamina mirrored hers, yet this was only the beginning; as she slowly forced herself into the bathroom, we were confronted by another minigame: brushing her teeth.</p><p dir="ltr">After finishing that sequence, players are introduced to a strange man that Sofia mistakes for her father. He appears friendly, instructing her to go about her day and eat breakfast. The interactions are tense, with one minigame consisting of the strange man feeding Sofia, much to her objection. The uneasiness builds, with the stranger asking Sofia to take some medication to feel better.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4562834-1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4562834" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1600" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4562834-1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4562834"></a><figcaption>Sofia sleepily brushes her teeth in And Roger.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4562834-1.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">As a scared child, she resists. And the QTE expertly reflects her struggles to fight. Again, by rapidly pressing a button, players are meant to push the man's hand away. The event itself was impossible to complete without outside assistance. Like Sofia, I felt powerless, completely unable to budge the extended hand until someone else was able to take control. After the event, I felt considerably weaker, but I continued to play, leading Sofia out of the apartment and into a bakery where she collapses at the sight and smells of a presumably safe space.</p><p dir="ltr">The bakery remains a key setting, both in terms of QTEs and core memories. Chapter Two begins with Sofia entering the bakery to purchase baked goods; There she meets Roger, and the connection is immediate. The ensuing dates consist of QTEs ranging from moving dials to choose a hairstyle, to tracing heart monitor lines as the two talk. It's a beautiful way to explore their blooming relationship, and the games expertly reflect the tenderness and fragility of new love.</p><p dir="ltr">Through these sections, Chapter Two beautifully demonstrates the importance of love and finding joy. Yet the struggles of dementia are ever present, and one QTE abruptly and forcibly brought me back into Sofia's current world.</p><p dir="ltr">Food is integral to the relationship between Sofia and Roger. Their romance began at the bakery, and numerous QTEs--from chopping vegetables to shifting dials to purchase bread--reflect this special bond. In one scene, players are required to spin a button around a pot, stirring the soup inside. If the button falls outside of the ring, the meter to complete the objective progressively depletes. On numerous occasions, my strength and stamina levels would fail to keep up with continuously spinning a button. After approximately 10 minutes and several breaks, I finished the task, once again leaving me physically exhausted. And after finishing and eating the meal, Sofia mimicked my energy levels, dropping the pot of soup on the floor.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Inaccessibility as a tool</h2><p dir="ltr">I've been professionally critiquing accessibility in games for six years. My reviews always focus on what is or isn't included, and how the lack of appropriate options or designs make games unplayable. With And Roger, I found myself conflicted with my own ethics and morals as a disability reporter. As someone who regularly pushes back on the belief that accessibility can ruin artistic vision, I struggled coming to terms with the fact that, in this instance, inaccessibility had made the game so much more profound.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4562837-copyofqas%281%29.png" data-ref-id="1300-4562837" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4562837-copyofqas%281%29.png" data-ref-id="1300-4562837"></a><figcaption>Sofia says she feels like she forgot something in a still for And Roger.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4562837-copyofqas%281%29.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">Players are meant to feel Sofia's struggles as she navigates her world. We're meant to feel her exhaustion, frustration, and animosity toward people and activities that once brought so much light into her life. And for me, someone with a physical disability, struggling to perform and finish certain QTEs only enhanced my connection with her. Do I recommend more games adopt this practice of forgoing accessibility? Absolutely not. But for this specific work of art, the emotional journey was vastly improved because I struggled to play.</p><p dir="ltr">And Roger wants players to appreciate the everyday moments in life, cherishing them on the chance they're one day outside of your control. Yet in addition to a greater appreciation for life, I also have a newfound appreciation for games and the unique way my disability interacts with them. Inaccessibility is so innately tied to the disabled experience. And Roger showed me that there is often beauty in moments of frustration.</p>

        <p>Plus new TikTok-style video feed incoming.</p>

            <p>Roblox is investing heavily in AI to assist users with game development, while also increasing the amount of money they can earn.</p>
<p>The news comes as part of the Roblox Developers Conference, where the platform also unveiled its new TikTok-style Moments feed of short-form videos taken directly from Roblox games.</p>
<p>Roblox now boasts an average of over 111.8 million daily active users and 390 billion visits to its games. Last month Roblox had a record-breaking 45 million concurrent users - higher than Steam - and over the past year, creators have earned over $1bn.</p>
<p>Roblox is now rewarding its creators with an increase to its DevEx rate - essentially the exchange rate from Robux to real cash. This has now risen by 8.5 percent, meaning 100,000 Robux equals $380.</p>
<p>AI is also a major way Roblox is enabling smaller teams to develop games on the platform. "To achieve our mission of connecting a billion people, we need creators around the world building at massive scale," the company said. It believes the majority of the top 1000 in-platform games were built by teams of, on average, fewer than 10 people.</p><p>In total, Roblox has 400 AI models in production. Its star product is 4D Objects, which it believes will overhaul UGC. Users will be able to create fully interactive scripted assets by a simple text prompt - for instance, generating a fully drivable and customised car.</p>
<p>Other AI products include text-to-speech and speech-to-text APIs, allowing creators to add dialogue to characters or command NPCs, and real-time voice chat translation (starting with English, Spanish, French, and German).</p>
<p>Roblox's other major development is its Moments feed. This will allow users to capture and edit short clips from games and share to a scrollable feed. Roblox hopes this will aid discovery on the platform, with users able to jump straight into a game from these videos. It will soon be available in specific countries in beta form (but not the UK or Australia).</p>

<p>"For years, our users have been doing this off-platform, creating a massive presence with Roblox-related content garnering over 1 trillion video views on YouTube," the company said. It's understandable it would want to keep this engagement on the platform. It also follows the likes of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/twitch">Twitch</a>, which <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/twitchs-revised-mobile-app-will-arrive-this-summer">similarly updated its mobile app with a Discovery Feed of clips</a> - it's clear the dominance of TikTok on social media is impacting many gaming platforms.</p>
<p>These developer updates from Roblox follow continued efforts from the company to improve safety, with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/roblox-continues-efforts-for-child-safety-by-expanding-age-estimation-to-all-users-by-end-of-the-year">Roblox expanding its age estimation requirement to all users</a> of the platform who access its communication features by the end of the year.</p>
<p>These safety efforts follow years of concern, with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/roblox-accused-of-being-unsafe-environment-for-children">multiple reports accusing Roblox of being unsafe for children</a>.</p>
<p>Last month, <a href="https://corp.roblox.com/newsroom/2025/08/roblox-responds-to-louisiana-ag-lawsuit">Roblox responded to a lawsuit accusing the company of failing to protect children</a>. "Any assertion that Roblox would intentionally put our users at risk of exploitation is simply untrue," it wrote. "No system is perfect and bad actors adapt to evade detection, including efforts to take users to other platforms, where safety standards and moderation practices may differ. We continuously work to block those efforts and to enhance our moderation approaches to promote a safe and enjoyable environment for all users."</p>
