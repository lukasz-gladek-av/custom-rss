<p>Arknights: Endfield has plenty for players to sink their teeth into, and a bunch of codes are available to redeem for handy bonuses to help your progression.</p>



<p>With so much to explore, it always helps to get everything you possibly can in your possession, and Insider Gaming has all the active codes to redeem in Arknights: Endfield.</p>







<h2 id="h-all-active-arknights-enfield-codes">All Active Arknights: Enfield Codes</h2>

<p><strong>There are several codes available to redeem in Arknights: Enfield, providing a boost of rewards, including various forms of currency.</strong></p>



<p>The majority are available for players across all platforms, though there is one additional PC-exclusive code. While some of the codes appear to be available permanently, others are limited-time and must be redeemed before the expiration date.</p>



<p>Once redeemed, all rewards must be claimed from the in-game mailbox within 30 days, or they will disappear, so it’s a good habit to claim the rewards immediately after redemption.</p>



<p>The table below shows all the active codes in Arknights: Enfield and the rewards earned for redemption.</p>

<h2 id="h-how-to-redeem-arknights-endfield-codes">How to Redeem Arknights: Endfield Codes</h2>



<p><strong>Code redemption in Arknights: Endfield is completed through a specific menu in the game, though it won’t be unlocked immediately.</strong></p>



<p>Early progression must be ticked off before the feature to redeem codes is made available, and more playtime is required to unlock the Mail feature, where bonuses can be claimed.</p>



<p>Here’s the step-by-step process to redeem codes in Arknights: Endfield.</p>



<ol>
<li>Play through the main story in Arknights Endfield until you complete the Valley Reboot mission.</li>



<li>In the menu, select the settings cog in the top-left of the screen.</li>



<li>Select the ‘Platform &amp; Account’ section.</li>



<li>Choose the ‘Exchange Code’ option.</li>



<li>Input the desired code.</li>



<li>Claim the rewards from your mailbox.</li>
</ol>



<p>If you’re yet to unlock the Mail feature, don’t worry, as any redeemed rewards will be waiting for you when you reach that stage in progression.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/life-is-strange-fans-dismay-reunion-ashly-burch/</link>
            <guid>1411642</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Yesterday, Life is Strange: Reunion was unveiled in full, with Deck Nine and Square Enix revealing the next game in the decade-old franchise. It follows directly on from 2024’s Life is Strange: Double Exposure, and for the first time since 2017, it brings back Chloe Price, the other half of the ‘Pricefield’ ship.</p>



<p>She’ll join Max Caulfield in a race against time to once again save the world (or at least their little bit of it) from certain cataclysmic catastrophes. However, following the reveal, much of the Life is Strange community has shared a wave of disappointment about Ashly Burch, the original voice actor for Chloe Price, <strong>not </strong>reprising her role.</p>







<h2 id="h-chloe-price-will-not-be-played-by-ashly-burch">Chloe Price Will Not Be Played by Ashly Burch</h2>



<p>Ashly Burch brought Chloe Price to life in the original Life is Strange title, released in 2015. However, she was unable to reprise that role in 2017’s Life is Strange: Before the Storm, a prequel, because of an embroilment in a voice actor’s strike at the time. This meant that Rhianna DeVries stepped in and fulfilled the role, doing a fairly decent job overall.</p>



<p>Yesterday, when Deck Nine unveiled Life is Strange: Reunion, it went with the announcement that DeVries would be returning alongside Hannah Telle (Max Caulfield) to play Chloe Price.</p>



<p>Fans took to social media to stress their concerns about this decision, with many suggesting that it’s not a ‘true reunion’ if the original voice actor isn’t involved.</p>







<p>One distressed user wrote, ‘My expectations could not be lower for Life is Strange: Reunion. It’s hard to be excited after the last game, and now we know it’s not even Ashly Burch as Chloe… Like what the f*** are you guys doing?’</p>



<p>Another offered a lengthy explanation to cover the community’s dismay:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Life is strange bringing back Chloe due to fan backlash but still not giving enough of a s*** to fork up enough cash to hire her original voice actor whenever <strong>Ashly</strong> <strong>Burch</strong>’s performance was half the reason anyone even liked that character in the first place.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In an attempt to dig deeper, one user raised a fair point:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Something definitely off with this game when Deck Nine brought back Rhianna DeVries for Chloe instead of <strong>Ashly</strong> <strong>Burch</strong> while there’s no SAG-AFTRA strike currently happening like during Before the Storm’s development.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>For the diehard fans of Life is Strange, Reunion will be more or less a guaranteed purchase, even if it’s a reluctant one. The wrapping of Max and Chloe’s story is too much of a dramatic pull to be ignored, and it’s a sequence that’s almost a decade in the making (and wanting).</p>







<p>Will you still be buying Life is Strange: Reunion this March, even though Ashly Burch isn’t in it? Let us know your thoughts on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

<p>Named <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/witcher3/mods/11590?tab=description">Witcher Online</a> and spotted by <a href="https://www.polygon.com/witcher-3-online-multiplayer-mod/">Polygon</a>, the mod's the work of a user going by Rejuvenate7. As they demonstrate in the trailer above, their creation's mainly focused on simply letting you hang out in The Witcher 3's gorgeous world with your mates on a custom server, with emotes providing basic ways to interact with each other. The premise is similar to mods like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-skyrim-together-co-op-mod-is-out-now-bringing-multiplayer-to-elder-scrolls-v">Skyrim Together</a>, though Witcher Online seems less advanced than that mammoth project at this stage. By the looks of it, gangs of up to five characters are supported.</p>
<p>You can wander the streets of Novigrad or Toussaint, go riding or swimming together, get a fresh trim, or just find somewhere with a nice view to sit and chat. Witcher Online's also compatible with another mod, <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/witcher3/mods/6402">Chill Out</a>, which looks to be responsible for some of the emotes and facilitates hanging out in taverns. By default, everyone plays as their own Geralt, but grabbing the <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/witcher3/mods/5940">Custom Player Characters</a> mod allows you to swap his model out for the likes of Yennefer or Lambert.</p>

<p>You can <a href="https://rejuvenate.gitbook.io/witcheronline/general-information/playguide">technically do missions and contracts together</a>, as shown in the video above, but this comes with the caveat that "other players cannot help you fight monsters, solve puzzles, or complete objectives". So, you'll be playing together simply by trying to work through each story beat in your character's version of the game world simultaneously, for example trying to sync up when you all step into a certain cutscene and which choices you make. Rejuvenate7 wrote that they've gone this route to prevent risk of folks' saves corrupting or softlocking, which very much makes it a worthy sacrifice in my eyes.</p><p>To get started with Witcher Online, you'll need a non-pirated copy of The Witcher 3 from either Steam or GOG, updated to its latest version, 4.04. If you're unsure which version you're running, verifying you game files should push you up to that latest one. You also look to need the Blood and Wine and Hearts of Stone DLCs, plus the <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/witcher3/mods/2110">Community Patch - Shared Imports</a> mod. Beyond that, there's a setup guide <a href="https://rejuvenate.gitbook.io/witcheronline/guides/getting-started">here</a>.</p>
<p>Now, all I need to do is find someone willing to accompany me on a jog up towards Kaer Trolde, so we can chill on the bridge in a fashion which definitely won't see them nudged off the edge to see how big a splash that causes.</p>

            <p>EA and BioWare's failed action-RPG shooter <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fond-anthem-farewells-begin-as-biowares-destiny-like-game-reaches-last-day-of-operation">Anthem was put down on 12th January</a>. No offline or P2P alternative for this one, at least officially. It was gone for good, with both the publisher and the studio <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/anthem-was-abandoned-in-death-as-in-life-its-a-game-ea-and-bioware-would-rather-forget">seemingly eager to move on</a>. However, fans aren't ready to let go.</p>
<p>Even though plans for a community-led revival project were already underway a couple of months ago <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/AnthemTheGame/comments/1pb8b3v/cenotaph_an_anthem_revival_project/">under the name Cenotaph</a>, it was the video posted on 17th January by user <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@andersson799">And799</a> on YouTube (hat tip to <a href="https://kotaku.com/anthem-revival-private-servers-shutdown-bioware-fan-2000661358">Kotaku</a>) that ignited real hopes of getting the back online:</p> <figure>

<p>This person was quick to underline this is just a personal research experiment, and if you look at their YouTube channel, it's clear they enjoy the process of looking through files and systems, mostly of EA-published games. Still, you can see for yourself <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/anthem">Anthem</a> doing mostly fine while running on private servers. Moreover, two players are shown in the same lobby. What doesn't work is the whole layer of the player's online profile and other stuff probably centralized on EA's now-missing servers.</p>
<p>Right after Anthem's death, ex-BioWare executive producer Mark Darrah pointed out during <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CxwrCRdqZb8">his massive video</a> on the game's inception, life, and death that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/anthem-local-servers-existed-at-bioware">code for local servers actually existed</a> and could be "salvaged and recovered." In fact, he suggested a $10m plan to reboot the game as a single-player-first experience if EA decided to part ways with the IP. That's a lot of wishful thinking, but it's definitely something the game's fans would celebrate. Looking at private experiments like And799's showing a lot of promise already, we're betting on fans figuring this one out eventually at the very least.</p><p>For now, other industry figures are <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gog-weighs-complicated-riddle-of-multiplayer-game-preservation">chiming in on multiplayer game preservation</a> as more and more online-only games are shut down. Up next on the chopping block is Amazon's troubled MMORPG <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/new-world">New World</a>, which was recently delisted and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/new-world-shutting-down-unless-saved-by-rust">will shut down on 31st January next year</a>.</p>

For example, Ghoul Vault Boy and Ghoul Vault Girl lamps are no longer described as needing power in the Workshop, and now even if you are a Ghoul wearing a disguise you will still be able to interact with Silas and the Rust King during the Welcoming Committee quest.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/yakuza-kiwami-3-dark-ties-get-demo-system-requirements/</link>
            <guid>1411624</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>This morning, <strong>Ryu Ga Gotoku</strong> <strong>Studio</strong> and <strong>SEGA</strong> have announced that a free <strong>Yakuza Kiwami 3 &amp; Dark Ties</strong> demo will be released later today on all platforms, albeit at different times. The PC version will get it first, at <strong>7 AM Pacific Time</strong>, while the console versions for Sony's PlayStation 5, Microsoft's Xbox Series S and X, and Nintendo Switch 2 will be available for download at <strong>9 PM Pacific Time</strong>.</p>



<p>Unlike other recent demos, users <strong>won't be able to carry over their save data to the full game</strong>, so it's really just a way to try the game before purchase. RGG Studio and SEGA have also outlined which sections have been prepared for the demo:</p>



<ul>
<li>In Yakuza Kiwami 3, players can explore <strong>Ryukyu</strong> in <strong>Okinawa</strong> as <strong>Kazuma Kiryu</strong>, beating down bad guys and dynamically switching between the brutal Dragon of Dojima: Kiwami style and the weapon-based Ryukyu style. Players can also indulge in immersive side experiences such as karaoke, sub-stories, and outfit customisation.</li>



<li>In Dark Ties, players can enjoy <strong>an all-new story featuring Yoshitaka Mine</strong> and explore <strong>Kamurocho</strong>, experiencing a variety of activities while also mastering Mine's shoot-boxing combat to stylishly dispose of foes.</li>
</ul>



<p>Yakuza Kiwami 3 &amp; Dark Ties <a href="https://wccftech.com/yakuza-kiwami-3-dark-ties-0-directors-cut-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was announced at the <strong>RGG Summit 2025</strong></a> in September. According to the developers, this is <strong>an 'extreme' remake</strong> of the third mainline installment in the series, which originally launched in 2009 for PlayStation 3 and later appeared on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. </p>



<p>Additionally, there's new content in the form of Dark Ties, which is centered on Yoshitaka Mine. Narratively, <strong>it is a prequel</strong> in which Mine willingly plunges into the dark world of the Yakuza after losing everything. Driven by the pursuit to find true bonds, he embarks on a dramatic journey coloured by exhilarating boxing-based combat and a variety of side experiences.</p>



<p>Yakuza Kiwami 3 &amp; Dark Ties will be released <strong>on February 12, 2026</strong> for all the aforementioned platforms. Pre-orders are already available, too, and pre-order customers will receive the bonus item Legendary Lad: Ichiban Kasuga that adds the fan-favorite character <strong>Ichiban Kasuga</strong> (protagonist of the more recent <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/yakuza-like-a-dragon-quest/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Like a Dragon</a></strong> games) to the Ryukyu Gal Gang.</p>



<p>As part of the demo news, the Steam store page was also updated with the <strong>official PC system requirements</strong>, which we've added below.</p>

<p>To celebrate the news, they have released a special trailer and kicked off a <strong>20% limited-time discount</strong> on <strong>Steam</strong>. The discount applies to all items on the store page, including the base game (down to <strong>$35.99</strong> from the original price of <strong>$44.99</strong>), the Sanctuary of Arras expansion that launched last month (now priced at <strong>$11.99</strong> instead of <strong>$14.99</strong>), the Adventure Pack that includes both (down to <strong>$47.98</strong> from <strong>$59.98</strong>), and even the Supporters Pack, which provides access to the official soundtrack and artbook, now for <strong>$7.99</strong> instead of <strong>$9.99</strong>.

<p>Tainted Grail: The Fall of Avalon was originally <a href="https://wccftech.com/tainted-grail-the-fall-of-avalon-open-world-rpg-announced-for-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> in December 2021, following the success of <strong>Tainted Grail: Conquest</strong>, a deck-building/roguelike/RPG hybrid. Wccftech's Kai Tatsumoto wasn't so fond of his experience with The Fall of Avalon, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/tainted-grail-something-wyrd/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">as you can read in the review</a>, but the user reception on Steam is great, with a review rating of 86% for recent reviews and 88% for overall reviews.</p>



<p>Given the successful launch, it is likely that Questline and Awaken Realms will work on a bigger, more polished sequel, though it may be a long time before it materializes. We'll keep you apprised of any news from the developer and publisher.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Bizarre Marathon Bug Auto-Installs Destiny 2 When You Pre-Order]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/bungie-marathon-destiny-bug-auto-install/</link>
            <guid>1411609</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Bungie recently uncovered Marathon’s release date, and shortly after, the ability to pre-order the game went live on platforms like Steam. However, a strange backend bug caused <strong>Destiny 2 </strong>(also developed by Bungie to <strong>install </strong>on Steam when you pre-ordered Marathon, the upcoming extraction shooter.</p>



<p>The strange bug was lauded on social media by fans and critics alike, with one user writing that preordering Marathon triggers a ‘virus called Destiny 2’ to install on your machine.</p>







<h2 id="h-bungie-fixes-marathon-bug">Bungie Fixes Marathon Bug</h2>



<p>Hours after the Steam bug went live, <strong>Bungie resolved the issue</strong>, also taking the time to address a concern where Collector’s Edition owners <strong>could not </strong>redeem their game code on Steam.</p>



<p>The team wrote on social media:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We’ve resolved an issue where Destiny 2 would begin installing after pre-ordering Marathon on Steam. We have also resolved an issue where Collector’s Edition owners would receive an error when attempting to activate their game code on Steam.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>If there was one entertaining thing to come from the debacle, it was the slew of comments poking fun at the situation.</p>



<p>One user wrote, ‘Marathon’s development was so cursed it created a malevolent spirit in the code. If it catches you, it will force you to install Destiny 2.’</p>



<p>Another said, ‘Bungie trying to revive Destiny 2 by any means possible.’</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>It’s a pretty bizarre bug, especially given that, aside from the developer link, Destiny 2 and Marathon are totally separate from one another.</p>



<p>Recently, Bungie shared a new trailer for Marathon, also uncovering the game’s impending release date as March 5. To celebrate the game’s launch, PlayStation has created an exclusive line of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/limited-edition-marathon-dualsense-and-headset-revealed/">limited-edition peripherals</a>, which will be available to pre-order from January 29.</p>



<p>Let’s just hope that pre-ordering the limited edition controller won’t trigger the automatic purchase of a PlayStation Portal, or something.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Recently, Bungie unveiled the release date for Marathon, the studio’s stab at an extraction shooter, along with a brand-new trailer. Shortly after, the game’s Steam page was updated with a full spread of system requirements for PC players, and they’re remarkably forgiving.</p>



<p>One of the leading elements that’s driving prospective fans to Marathon is the game’s art style and visual palette, which apparently needs very little in the way of tech specs to run.</p>







<h2 id="h-marathon-pc-specs-confirmed-as-low-entry">Marathon PC Specs Confirmed as Low Entry</h2>



<p>On Steam, you can check out the full recommended PC specs for Marathon, noting that they’re extremely accessible. This continues a trend where new games are coming out with more forgiving minimum and recommended specification requirements, a fact that pleases gamers everywhere.</p>



<p>Here’s the breakdown:</p>



<p><strong>Minimum Spec:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Intel Core i5-6600 / AMD Ryzen 5 2600</li>



<li>8 GB RAM</li>



<li>GTX 1050 Ti (4 GB) / RX 5500 XT (4 GB)</li>
</ul>







<p><strong>Recommended Spec:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Intel Core i5-10400 / Ryzen 5 3500</li>



<li>16 GB RAM</li>



<li>GTX 2060 (6 GB) / RX 5700 XT (8 GB)</li>
</ul>



<p>The <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3065800/Marathon/">recommended specs for Marathon</a> are centered around a CPU range that was released almost six years ago, and a GPU spread that dropped as far back as January 2019. That lowers the barrier massively for PC players wanting to get into Marathon, one of the most (tentatively) anticipated first-person extraction shooters coming out this year.</p>



<p>ARC Raiders, the extraction adventure title released by Embark Studios in October 2025, followed a similar pattern. For the recommended PC specs, ARC Raiders requests almost the same components.</p>



<p>By comparison, Escape from Tarkov, the spearhead extraction shooter that launched as a 1.0 game in November, has <strong>sky-high recommended specs</strong>. To run Escape from Tarkov at the optimum level, you need a 2024 CPU, an RTX 4070 ‘or better’, and a whopping 64 GB of RAM.</p>







<p>Do you have the computing power to run Marathon at a decent level? Let us know what settings you’ll be choosing on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

            <guid>1411591</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">Any game built around gacha mechanics needs to have a certain hook to keep things interesting in the long term, especially if there’s potential to invest your hard-earned dollars into it. For all their systemic sins, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/game-of-thrones-kingsroad-review"><u>Game of Thrones: Kingsroad</u></a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/persona5-the-phantom-x-review"><u>Persona 5: The Phantom X</u></a> at least piqued my interest by expanding on already-revered lore, allowing me to intertwine myself in their beloved worlds. The much more enjoyable <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/zenless-zone-zero-review"><u>Zenless Zone Zero</u></a>, on the other hand, pulled me in with a mix of high-octane combat, endearing character development, and Y2K flair. Arknights: Endfield is the latest competitor in this genre’s fierce attention economy, offering not only an engrossing sci-fi open world to explore, but another mechanically moreish addition: base building and automation. After approximately twenty hours of Endministrating, it’s clear there’s a lot more to uncover here beyond its sticky login loop, but crucially, I’m keen to expand my horizons in search of character motives, upgrades, and ultimately rewarding depth.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In Arknights: Endfield, you play as the Endministrator (or Endmin for short) who, after a 10-year absence and an unfortunate case of amnesia, returns to the world of the living to reinhabit the planet of Talos-II. Taming the wilds is no small task, though, and on top of trying to remember who you were before your big sleep, you’ll also face off against a range of evil entities, including leather-clad maurauders, shifting zoomorphic creatures, and other mythic, well-dressed baddies. It’s an intriguing premise, unfortunately told through an exposition-heavy opening with awkward stop-and-start pacing. Still, if you brave its dialogue-dense beginning, Arknights: Endfield eventually opens up, delivering visually enticing battles and a captivating atmosphere that help make up for it.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><span data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><div data-cy="slideshow-preview"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Arknights: Endfield Gameplay Screenshots</h3></div></span></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Your job primarily involves adventuring with your team to the surface of Talos-II to hunt for resources, solve simple environmental platforming puzzles, and eventually clear out whole areas which you can access in the metagame to build and automate machinery. To do this, you’ll use a team of up to four Operators who, under your control, fight and collect items to push the lengthy story ever onwards. Early on, you’ll have a limited pool of story-specific characters to play as, like the masked Endmin, the empathetic mission-oriented Perlica, and the spirited Chen Qianyu, though eventually you’ll be able to use a specially earned gacha currency to pull new characters, too. It’s not the most imaginative gameplay, with many of the puzzles involving finding and pressing a few buttons on a small map to find success, or trawling through the same few groups of bad guys to push through an area. Still, this is all set against a striking cyberpunk backdrop that makes it surprisingly easy to sink hours into. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">As you can imagine, there is an eye-watering array of currencies to consider here — a painful staple of the genre. On top of the usual gacha pulling, which allows you to randomly unlock unique characters and weapons, there’s also a paid Battle Pass that rewards you with resources that can be filtered into systems that help speed up progression, that is, if you can figure them out. It’s hard to say from only the week I’ve spent with it so far whether this feels balanced or not, but I’ve not run into any significant roadblocks that would encourage me to pull out my wallet in the early game – though only time will tell, and based on what I’ve seen so far, I’m not overly confident I won’t eventually find a few.  </p><p>A lot of effort has been put into worldbuilding and character design.<span><span>“</span></span></p><p data-cy="paragraph">While my humble crew was more than enough for me in the beginning, once I’d earned the currency needed to try out the character lottery firsthand, my feelings began to shift. In my first pull, I drew Estella, an adorable beanie-wearing warrior who compelled me with their nonchalant attitude and stylish techwear garb. Soon after that, I fell in love with Da Pan, a hungry panda whose leather jacket and belt combo gave him the aura of a dad navigating a midlife crisis. I’d like to say I stopped becoming attached to the characters as I kept pulling more. Alas, the range of unique designs, alongside their quippy one-liners, was effective enough to tug on my heartstrings. While I wouldn’t pay for currency with my own money beyond what is provided organically, I was happy to see that, if I did, developer Hypergryph has put a lot of effort into its worldbuilding and character design.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It helps that a character’s personality also tends to shape how they move in battle, and throughout my time with Arknights: Endfield, the flashy combat quickly became my favourite aspect. Hits are delivered with vibrant visual payoff, so much so that even my silly mistakes looked like intentional moves. As you explore, you’ll encounter groups of various enemies camped out, like violent blobs of possessed water or sword-wielding bandits, all of which feature level indicators hovering above their heads. Once ready to engage, you run directly at them, weapons brandished, and start swiping away. </p><span data-cy="poll-view-trigger"></span><p data-cy="paragraph">Instead of controlling the Edmin alone, you switch between all the members of your team in battle, applying button-mashing combos that feel engaging in motion. Each character has a dodge, a light attack, and a special attack that string together nicely, delivering well-choreographed combos.

<p>Alongside GameStop's exit from the New Zealand market</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure data-uuid="33deec88e9222"><a title="EB Games" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/33deec88e9222/eb-games.large.jpg"></a></figure><p>Last week, we got an update about GameStop's EB Games business in New Zealand, which confirmed <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/01/gamestop-kicks-off-2026-by-reportedly-shutting-hundreds-of-stores">38 stores in the country would be closing</a> at the end of this month. At the time, no information was provided about the future of the 336 Australian stores, but we've now got some details.</p>
<p>As reported by <a href="https://www.vooks.net/dont-freak-out-a-handful-of-australian-eb-games-stores-are-closing-this-month/">local Nintendo fan site Vooks</a>, the video game retailer will be closing "at least" 10 stores across Australia this month, and many have already shut their doors. One of these stores includes an EB 'Zing Pop Culture' shop, which specialises in merchandise, trading cards and various other items.</p><div><figure data-videoid="vEee42ub-Hw" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vEee42ub-Hw?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytvEee42ub-Hw" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/vEee42ub-Hw?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vEee42ub-Hw?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed4021b7xiusvw&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>841k</span></a></p>

<p>No other details about these closures have been shared, but it is the end of the financial year for parent company GameStop, so underperforming stores (or shops not extending their leases) sometimes get cut. This isn't the first time this has happened in Australia, with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2020/01/gamestop_subsidiary_eb_games_closing_19_unprofitable_stores_across_australia">around 20 "unprofitable" EB Games stores</a> closed down under in 2020.</p>
<p>EB Games, originally named Electronics Boutique, began in Australia in 1997 and started operations in New Zealand in the year 2000. It was then acquired by GameStop in 2005. If we hear any other significant updates about these EB Games store closures (or GameStop shutdowns in general), we'll let you know. Find out more about the closures in our previous story:</p>

<p>Here's exactly what you can expect from the demo when it rolls out on the Switch 2 eShop (<a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2026/01/yakuza-kiwami-3-dark-ties-demo-launches-january-21-for-pc-january-22-for-ps5-xbox-series-and-switch-2">via Gematsu</a>):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In this free demo, players will experience both games included in the two-games-in-one, action adventure beat ’em up.</p>
<p>In <em>Yakuza Kiwami 3</em>, players can explore Ryukyu, Okinawa as Kazuma Kiryu, beating down bad guys while dynamically switching between Kiryu’s brutal Dragon of Dojima: Kiwami and weapon-based Ryukyu styles and indulging in immersive side experiences like karaoke, sub-stories, outfit customization and more.</p>
<p>In <em>Dark Ties</em>, players can enjoy a slice of the all-new story featuring Yoshitaka Mine, exploring Kamurocho and variety of side experiences while also sinking their teeth into Mine’s shoot-boxing combat to stylishly dispose of foes.</p>

It's inevitably led to questions about the Switch 2 getting a price hike in the future.</p>
<p>Although there has been no official announcement from Nintendo about a price increase at this stage, the video game business intelligence and consumer insight firm <a href="https://nikopartners.com/niko-partners-2026-predictions/">Niko Partners</a> believes a "global price hike" for the new system is likely on the way this year. It shared this in its latest "predictions" piece for 2026, which suggests Nintendo may even "opt to discontinue" the $449 SKU and only sell a $499 or "higher" priced bundle.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"We believe the Switch 2 is set to follow in Sony and Microsoft’s footsteps with its own price hike driven by the impact from tariffs, increased memory costs, and broader macroeconomic conditions. Nintendo chose to maintain its $449 entry price last year despite the introduction of tariffs impacting production in China, Japan and Vietnam. More recently, increased demand for AI data centers has pushed RAM and storage prices up.</p>
<p>"While we do anticipate Nintendo to increase the price of the Switch 2, they may opt to discontinue the $449 SKU and only sell a $499 or higher bundle SKU instead."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nintendo president Shuntaro Furukawa was <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/01/nintendos-president-remains-coy-on-potential-price-increases">recently asked about a possible price increase</a> for the Switch 2 this year and said he couldn't "comment on hypotheticals". However, he did acknowledge the current memory prices, stating at the time, how it had no "immediate" impact on Nintendo's financials but the company would continue to monitor the situation closely.</p>
<p>This latest prediction from Niko Partners follows a story last week about the discovery of a "mystery code", which quickly <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/01/mystery-product-code-sparks-rumours-of-a-new-switch-2-model">sparked rumours about a new Switch 2 model</a>.</p>

It’s the kind of thing that would seem completely nonsensical to the uninitiated, but those who are even peripherally aware of the NBC comedy will recognize “Build. Beets. Battle Royale.” as a reference to one of the most memorable quotes from The Office.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">Build. Beets.

Popular Fortnite content creator Shiina said <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EzUlbmE9wFE" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>they heard The Office could soon show up</u></a> just last week. At the time, they suggested a rumor about “<a href="https://x.com/SamLeakss/status/2011479573670596794?s=20" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>a nostalgic duo from a live-action TV series</u></a>” was tied to the show but neglected to share more.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Which members of the Dunder Mifflin crew could be recreated in Epic’s battle royale mega-hit remains a mystery, but references to names like Michael Scott, Dwight Schrute, Jim Halpert, and Pam Beesly seem the most likely.

Their <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UvGl6kixgSE" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">new video</a> comes with the suggestion that the classic workplace comedy is coming soon, with content for Regular Show and Ed, Edd n Eddy also in the works at Epic.

            <title><![CDATA[Embark Insists You ‘Profit Way More’ When You Join ARC Raiders Games Late]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-late-join-embark-insists-more-profit/</link>
            <guid>1411459</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>If you’ve played ARC Raiders at all since the game dropped at the end of October 2025, you likely know about the ‘late joining’ issue that has plagued players since the beginning. It’s not <strong>an issue </strong>with the game, as it’s by design, but it’s a problem for players who appreciate full raids and lengthy sessions.</p>



<p>In a recent interview, Embark Studios confirmed that they’re aware of the concerns players have with joining raids late, but they’re trying to make amends and set minds at ease. They’ve said that ‘players who join late economically profit way more than people who aren’t.’</p>



<p>Really?</p>







<h2 id="h-why-do-you-join-late-in-arc-raiders">Why Do You Join Late in ARC Raiders?</h2>



<p>If it wasn’t already obvious enough, you can join late in ARC Raiders, often by ten or fifteen minutes, because Embark Studios wants to prevent lobbies from running stale. If you start with 30 minutes on the clock, the raid would be flat empty by the 15 or 10-minute mark, so feeding in more players later on ensures there’s almost always someone else to fight or meet.</p>



<p>However, players who load in late are almost always disappointed, as it feels like there isn’t enough time to do anything in the game.</p>



<p>If you spawn in late on a map like Spaceport, you’re basically writing off the raid, as it can take several minutes just to cross to the other side of the map, if that’s where your objective or goal is.</p>



<p>In a recent interview with <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/third-person-shooter/that-really-sucks-arc-raiders-lead-responds-to-complaints-about-late-spawns-says-late-joiners-are-important-and-profit-way-more-but-embark-knows-its-annoying-to-have-no-time-for-objectives/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Games Radar</a>, design lead Virgil Watkins explained that the team at Embark Studios <strong>is aware </strong>of this concern and actively tracking it:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>That’s also another topic we’ve been discussing a lot, and it’s another one of those interesting things of data versus perception. We 100% acknowledge the whole thing of, ‘Man, I came in to do that trial and now I clearly don’t have enough time to do that, and that sucks, so I’m just going to leave,’ or whatever. That aspect is definitely not great.</p>



<p>But similar to the perception of free kits versus what they do, the perception around late joining and what it affords you has been quite interesting. Players are like, ‘The loot’s all gone,’ or whatever else. But players who <strong>join late economically profit way more</strong> than people who aren’t.&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Watkins insists that joining late in ARC Raiders <strong>is not </strong>a bad thing. It means you can pick up the ‘remnants of fights’, picking apart dead bodies, fallen ARC, and scooping up any loot that might have been left behind. He suggested you’ll be loading into a quieter raid that has run mostly out of steam, leaving you to be left alone a little more when it comes to looting.</p>



<p>He stressed that everything is by design and that there are good intentions behind the decision to run ARC Raiders like this:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Okay, well my plan A isn’t possible. I’m gonna do my plan B or C now instead. </p>



<p>The amount of loot we spawn, where it’s spawned, where the spawn points are – it’s all set up in a way that there should be plenty of stuff for players to do.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Embark acknowledges it’s a <strong>pain point</strong>, and Watkins said they’re looking at that and ‘trying to do more on that side of things’, reducing the suffering brought on by joining late with an exclusive objective in mind that you now <strong>can’t accomplish</strong>.</p>

              <p>A YouTuber reportedly discovered a way to generate infinite money via a strange trade-in deal glitch at GameStop. After making a video about it, the company figured out what was going on and has now claimed to have “patched” the bug. Or maybe this is all some odd marketing stunt. Or somehow both things are true. It’s hard to say anymore.</p> <p>On January 20, video game retailer, <a href="https://kotaku.com/gamestop-bitcoin-half-a-billion-500-million-meme-stock-1851782733">Bitcoin investor</a>, and Funko Pop graveyard <a href="https://x.com/gamestop/status/2013691078109733056">GameStop posted a lengthy comment</a> to Twitter about a so-called “Infinite Money Glitch” that was recently discovered by <a href="https://youtu.be/6GEgSUUJ758">YouTube content creator RJCmedia</a>. How the glitch worked, apparently, was that if you bought a Nintendo Switch 2 for $415 and then immediately traded it back in along with the purchase of any pre-owned game, a promo would be triggered that increased the value of the trade-in to $472. Repeat this a few times, and you could rack up a few hundred bucks in trade-in credit.</p>

 <p>Here’s why this glitch happened and how it worked, according to GameStop:</p> <p>“In short, our system briefly valued the pre-owned trade more than the new retail cost of the console itself, creating a narrow window where customers could repeat this transaction over and over again to amass infinite trade credit,” said GameStop on social media.</p>  <h2>GameStop’s response to the infinite money glitch</h2> <p>GameStop says that “effective immediately, the glitch has been patched.” It further added that “trade promotions have been updated to ensure customers can no longer convert basic arithmetic into an endless revenue stream, and balance has been restored.”</p>

 <p>GameStop, a company that has become famous for memes, shitposting, spinning dumb mistakes into marketing material, and also for reportedly treating its employees poorly, ended its lengthy statement by reminding people that it remains “committed to offering promotions that reward” its customers. However, it “gently” reminded people that its stores are “not designed to function as infinite money printers.”</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">GAMESTOP ISSUES STATEMENT ON INFINITE MONEY GLITCH</p> <p>GameStop is aware of the “GameStop Infinite Money Glitch,” exposed by YouTuber RJCmedia. </p> <p>By purchasing a Nintendo Switch 2 for $414.99 and then immediately trading it back in along with the purchase of a pre-owned game, a… <a href="https://t.co/F2D2v41IeQ">pic.twitter.com/F2D2v41IeQ</a></p> <p>— GameStop (@gamestop) <a href="https://twitter.com/gamestop/status/2013691078109733056?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 20, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p>So now the big question: Is this real? The video from RJCmedia seems real enough, with the creator visiting different stores and filming the process of trading in each console. There is also a bit where he is surprised to see a GameStop store closing soon and isn’t able to pull off the trade glitch there. Alluding to the news that many GameStop stores will be shutting down due to greed would likely be something the company wouldn’t want in a piece of viral marketing. There’s also nothing in the video disclosing it as a paid ad, and the creator isn’t massive, so it doesn’t seem like a person the company would partner with to do some weird guerrilla marketing. If it seems odd that I’m spending this much time dissecting whether or not this is real, it’s because <a href="https://kotaku.com/gamestop-s-stock-price-soars-to-new-records-because-cap-1846113214">GameStop is a very weird</a> <a href="https://kotaku.com/gamestop-xbox-360-digital-marketplace-physical-discs-1851609043">company these days</a>, <a href="https://kotaku.com/gamestops-concept-stores-of-the-future-are-very-sad-1841917148">and you</a> <a href="https://kotaku.com/gamestop-gme-bitcoin-meme-stock-close-stores-1851772455">gotta be careful out there</a>.</p> <p>Anyway, I think this is all real, though the statement from GameStop is clearly trying to make this a fun situation, <a href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-box-staples-gamestop-replacement-launch-1851783684">which reminds me of the stapler incident from last year.</a> I hope others out there got to take advantage of this strange bug. Power to the players and all that, you know?</p>

              <p><span>Rare </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>cards are locked up in one of the most secure locations in the United States. The Surging Sparks Pikachu, which includes a full art illustration of the little yellow guy adorned in a Stellar-type Tera crown, is sitting in a Lucky Box vending machine in the Pentagon food court. Good luck getting into that, </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-card-shops-robbed-100k-nyc-masked-thieves-anime-backpacks-recently-opened-2000660233"><span>card robbers</span></a><span>.</span></p> <p><a href="https://www.404media.co/theres-a-lootbox-with-rare-pokemon-cards-sitting-in-the-pentagon-food-court/?ref=aftermath.site"><i><span>404 Media</span></i></a><span> reports that the Lucky Box vending machine, which is essentially a gacha machine for rare, graded cards of both the sports and trading card game variety, was seemingly put up in the United States’ military headquarters </span><a href="https://taskandpurpose.com/news/pentagon-lucky-box/?ref=404media.co"><span>around Christmas Eve last month</span></a><span>.&nbsp;</span></p>

   <figure id="attachment_2000661404" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000661404"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000661404">© The Pokémon Company</figcaption></figure> <p><span>In a now-deleted Threads announcement, Lucky Box posted that it had set up one of its loot box machines in the Pentagon food court, and&nbsp; among the potential prizes which the machine’s display touts could be yours if you blindly give it some cash is the aforementioned Pikachu card. Based on photos posted on the </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/army/comments/1qbc0du/comment/nz9gcjz/?ref=404media.co"><span>Army subreddit</span></a><span>, the machine also has an image of a giant Charizard card on the side of it, but it’s unclear if that’s just decoration or if the original fire-breathing dragon card is also in that specific machine. Taking your chances at a Luck Box machine can cost anywhere from $100 to $200.</span></p> <p><span>Lucky Box’s </span><a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DSf3_KvCWta/"><span>social media accounts</span></a><span> include photos of big winners, some of whom won rare </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>cards, while others won autographed jerseys from various sports teams. But it doesn’t look like they’ve posted anyone scoring something big in the middle of the Pentagon yet. In fact, most of its posts feature the boxes in Las Vegas, where </span><a href="https://luckyboxvending.com/pages/store-locator"><span>over 20 of the machines are found</span></a><span>. The winners that are featured are finding some pretty valuable </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>cards, though, from a rare Venusaur to the ancient Mew promo card from </span><i><span>Pokémon: The First Movie</span></i><span>’s theatrical run.</span></p>   <p><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>cards are already pretty much considered gambling by people who crack packs open by the dozens in the hopes of scoring a quick buck, but it’s still striking to see that concept&nbsp; demonstrated as blatantly as it is here, with valuable cards locked away in a machine that requires people to shell out hundreds of dollars for a small chance of scoring one.. Thank goodness the most powerful military in the world is keeping its eye on the machine until the lucky winner comes along. </span></p>

              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/console-wars-are-over-ps5-xbox-forza-switch-2-sony-1851752956">The console wars ended a while ago</a>, in case you didn’t know. But if they were still raging on, a talented hardware modder in China created a device that would force a lasting peace. It’s a massive and very cleverly designed triangular box that contains an Xbox, PlayStation, and Switch 2. They all work and can be easily swapped between with the press of a button.</p> <p><a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/video-games/console-gaming/modder-builds-all-in-one-console-with-ps5-xbox-series-x-and-switch-2-in-a-single-system-ningtendo-pxbox-5-powered-by-a-shared-250w-power-supply-mounted-inside-a-lost-wax-chassis">As first spotted by <em>Tom’s Hardware</em>,</a> Chinese tech and computer expert <em>小宁子 XNZ&nbsp;</em><a href="https://youtu.be/FAIqzpbv9Xw">has created an all-in-one mega console</a> which she anointed the “Ningtendo PXBOX 5,” a name that just rolls right off the tongue. According to XNZ, the idea behind this wild device came from her wanting to play various console-exclusive games without having to get up and manually power on and off each machine to switch between them.</p>

  <p>The design of the monster machine is inspired by the <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/112025">2013 Apple Mac Pro, aka the one that looked like a trash can</a>. And while she didn’t use the actual innards of an old Mac, the inside of that strange computer was a triangular setup that ended up being the perfect design to house three disassembled gaming consoles. A fan at the bottom is then used to cool the consoles.</p> <p>But creating a triangular heatsink for that would be expensive, so XNZ used an ancient method known as lost-wax casting to create the high-end piece of tech. Essentially, you first create an object out of an easy-to-melt piece of material, like wax or plastic, and then coat it in a heat-resistant material. Then you heat the object and all the soft insides melt and you can pour molten metal inside, which hardens and cools into your desired shape. Nifty!</p>

 <p>The end product is an impressive device but it might not be the most practical. The power supply she used only allows one console at a time to play a game, though the others can idle in the background. A big button on top switches the HDMI input between the consoles. Probably easier and cheaper to just buy the consoles and an HDMI switcher with a remote, but that’s not nearly as cool as the Ningtendo PXBOX 5.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[StarCraft II Won’t Be At EWC 2026, Nor Will Any Other RTS Title]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/starcraft-ii-wont-be-at-ewc-2026-nor-any-rts/</link>
            <guid>1411426</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The recent announcement of the full Esports World Cup 2026 lineup has rattled RTS fans worldwide. The team at the Esports World Cup Foundation recently unveiled the <strong>last game </strong>in the roster, <strong>Trackmania</strong>, which is set to appear at the event in Riyadh for the first time.</p>



<p>However, this reveal means that StarCraft II, the beloved RTS game, <strong>will not </strong>surface at this year’s Esports World Cup, despite being present for the first two. It gets worse, as with the full lineup having been published, we know that <strong>no other RTS game </strong>will be there to replace it.</p>











<p>For the first time since the inaugural Esports World Cup in 2023, no RTS title will take to any stage at the event this year. The EWCF uncovered Trackmania as an unexpected final addition to the star-studded spread of titles gracing the Esports World Cup, and in that moment, RTS fans worldwide fell to their knees (metaphorically, of course).</p>



<p>Across social media, fans have voiced their displeasure at the snub. Kaelaris, a popular commentator and host with a penchant for StarCraft II, said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I was already having a rough day but no StarCraft at EWC hurts.</p>



<p>I suspect that also means I won’t be doing any SC2 in 2026 since that was the only place nowadays that fancies taking a desk host for the game.</p>



<p>Despite getting to do it at EWC last year, effectively to me it feels like a part of my life perished and I feel like I’m almost in mourning for that aspect of my world. It’s not been easy for my brain to get over it. That’s as best I can describe it at least.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In another post, creator and commentator Simon ‘Lowko’ Heijnen wrote:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Very sad to not have StarCraft 2 or any other RTS game at the EWC this year. Especially considering views and interest has been up noticeably compared to a few years ago.</p>

<p>Many were quick to point out that the Esports World Cup helped keep the competitive system afloat after waning interest and some tournament shutdowns. This is another major, international stage to be stripped from the RTS audience, and it’s a huge blow.</p>



<p>The Esports World Cup 2026 is shaping up to be the largest esports event ever held. But for many, it might be remembered as the year that the oldest competitive genre in esports was forgotten, pushed aside for an arcade racing game.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
      <p><a href="https://aftermath.site/game-of-the-year-2025-aftermath-luke-plunkett/" rel="noreferrer">My 2025 obsession with city-builders</a> is running straight through into 2026 with <em>Whiskerwood</em>, which recently came out in Early Access and which, even unfinished, is legitimately one of the best and most interesting examples of the genre.</p><figure><a href="https://aftermath.site/game-of-the-year-2025-aftermath-luke-plunkett/"><div><p>Luke’s Favourite Video Games Of 2025</p><p>A year where indie city-builders carried the load following some big AAA disappointments</p><p><span>Luke Plunkett</span></p></div></a></figure><p>Set in the 1700s (though, not <em>our </em>1700s), you play as the leader of some little mice (<em>Redwall</em> fans, ahoy) who have been sent by their cat overlords to settle a distant (and importantly, unoccupied) land. Upon landing and picking out your settlement spot you begin a survival city-builder that appears to be quite conventional: you need to harvest timber and stone so you can build houses and farms, which you’ll need to support a growing population, while also keeping everyone fed and warm so they don't die during the depths of winter.&nbsp;</p><p>Were that all there was to this game, just a city-builder starring cute little mice, it would still be great. There's a staggering amount of tech and buildings to unlock, and a ton of resources to work with. What begins with picking berries and chopping down logs gets very quickly into pipe systems and mass transportation, and while early on you’re only building houses and docks, later you’ll need multiple buildings specialising in the inputs required for everything from tailored winter clothing to scissors.&nbsp;</p><figure><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/X4VVSaG9WnE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" title="Whiskerwood - Launch Trailer | Cats &amp; Mice City-Builder Game"></iframe></figure><p><em>Whiskerwood</em> does a fantastic job of tracking the myriad of resources required to support this burgeoning commercial network. Click on a building and you’re instantly shown everything you need to know, like where the workers are right now on the map, what they’re doing, what the status of its current production is and what, if anything, is holding that up. Need to find a specific building, or a count of how much tea everyone has drunk today? It’s all 1-2 clicks away. I know this sounds like something all city-builders do and should do, but they don’t! Failing to tell the player all the information they need is where so many of them fall down!</p><p>The production chains, while appearing daunting at first glance, are also pretty fun to get going. <em>Whiskerwood</em> is packed with workshops that will turn something raw into something processed, then turn that processed thing into something else. Sometimes it’ll need more raw ingredients, sometimes it’ll need fresh water (requiring a piped water network) and often combinations of all of those. It’s very clear how to get these all up and running and to keep track of how they’re going, so from humble beginnings you can get some cool stuff going late-game, to the point it feels like <em>Factorio</em> in parts as you strive for the most economical way possible to move your resources from building to building (the developers’ last game went very hard on production).&nbsp;</p><p>It’s clear the team have put a <em>lot </em>of thought into what makes these games sing beyond the basics. You know everything you need to know at all times, thanks to the on-screen indicators and menus. The Interface is wonderful, and designed in a way that keeps you busy constantly; there’s always something broken or short on supply, which requires you to personally attend to it and generally make very precise orders, but rather than being an annoyance or something you wish could be automated, here it’s just an invitation to get creative. Mistakes in <em>Whiskerwood</em> are <em>fun</em>, a rarity in city-builders, but especially in survival ones.&nbsp;</p><figure></figure><p>The emphasis on logistics is also astounding in how thorough and robust it is, even at this Early Access stage. <em>Whiskerwood</em> runs on a day/night cycle, limiting the amount of work every mouse can do each day, so it's imperative to make sure your workers’ commutes are as short as possible, while also optimising the delivery of goods through first direct paths, then later on conveyer belts, elevators and even railways. Commutes even factor into a mouse’s happiness, so <em>Whiskerwood</em> is in effect asking you to build several 15-minute settlements across the map, then endlessly refine them in a way that’s so taxing, and rewarding, that it could have just been its own video game.</p><p>But that’s not all there is to it. Remarkably, <em>Whiskerwood</em> also has <a href="https://aftermath.site/sid-meiers-colonization-pc-windows-game/" rel="noreferrer">a whole <em>Sid Meier’s</em> <em>Colonization</em> thing going on as well</a>, set in a politically tumultuous time, and laced with secessionist possibilities. Just like in <em>Colonization</em> your overlords are assholes, and just like in <em>Colonization</em> they’re also necessary because they’re supplying you, so you pay your taxes (colonial ships arrive at your towns periodically and demand huge portions of your goods), you buy fancy gear from home and you will like it. And just like in <em>Colonization</em>, a big part of your workforce planning is defined by the skills and experience your colonists have when they land, making some much better suited to certain jobs than others.</p><figure><a href="https://aftermath.site/sid-meiers-colonization-pc-windows-game/"><div><p>Sid Meier’s Colonization Is The American Video Game - Aftermath</p><p>No game has told the American story better, whether intentionally or not</p><p><span>Aftermath</span><span>Luke Plunkett</span></p></div></a></figure><p>The bigger your colony gets, and the more self-sufficient it becomes, the more you can start to question that power balance, and maybe do something about it. Annoy the motherland enough and they’ll snap, cutting you off from vital supplies and sending warships to your harbour which bombard you, causing huge amounts of destruction which you need to repair.&nbsp;</p><p>There’s also…well actually that’s about it for the rebellion stuff, which is very much in an either unfinished or not-even-there-yet stage. You can see where the game’s going to try to go with it, but it’s clearly prioritising city-building at this stage of development over its political play.</p><p>I know I spent a lot of time in 2025 talking about city-building and resource management, so I'm sorry to begin 2026 doing exactly the same thing. But hey, it's not my fault the folks making cool games in this genre are getting so smart and making such interesting stuff. And <em>Whiskerwood</em> is one of the smartest I’ve played in a <em>long </em>time. </p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/1047-games-makes-one-final-bid-splitgate-arena-reloaded-battle-royale-arena-royale/</link>
            <guid>1411411</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p><strong>1047 Games</strong> is making one, potentially final, bid to keep <strong>Splitgate: Arena Reloaded</strong> alive with a new battle royale mode called <strong>Arena Royale</strong>. If you weren't aware, Splitgate: Arena Reloaded is the new title for <strong>Splitgate 2</strong>, a name that emerged after <a href="https://wccftech.com/splitgate-2-back-to-beta-re-launch-2026-og-splitgate-servers-shutdown-1047-games-layoffs/">the maligned sequel was relaunched, and 1047 Games decided to shut down the OG Splitgate servers.</a> Arena Reloaded is meant to represent a combination of the best of both games, just like how its new Arena Royale mode is intended to be the best parts of a battle royale and an arena shooter in one.</p>



<p>That's the pitch made by 1047 Games design director <strong>Josh Watson</strong>, who breaks down what the team didn't like about current battle royales and how it let those feelings lead the design of Arena Royale to make a game mode that is still technically a battle royale mode, but in the most arena shooter way possible.</p>



<p>"<em>When we sat down to design Arena Royale, we knew we wanted to push it closer to that arena feel</em>," Watson begins. "<em>And we kept coming back to this core idea: <strong>less looting, more shooting</strong>. You see,</em> <em>traditional battle royales have long stretches where you're not really playing. You're staring at chests, traversing</em> <em>empty space, and waiting for your next fight."</em></p>



<p>"<em>Arena shooters are the opposite. They're about fast action and fast engagement. Arena Royale is the best of both worlds</em>."</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Introducing Arena Royale | SPLITGATE: Arena Reloaded" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dvueCO7-ofo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Watson goes on to explain some of the core differences between the kind of battle royale you're already familiar with and the kind that 1047 Games has put together. You won't drop from a ship; you'll instead be dropped into a lobby ahead of every match, where you'll vote between one of the four available maps by standing in front of the one you want. </p>



<p>When the match begins, you'll instantly spawn in and go from there. The four available maps (or biomes, as Watson calls them) are <strong>Dought, Glacier, Fracture</strong>, and <strong>Outskirts</strong>, which is an entirely new biome that, frankly, at a quick glance, looks like a smaller knock-off of Kings Canyon from <strong>Apex Legends</strong>. That's not necessarily a bad thing; Kings Canyon is a pretty iconic map with some great POIs. If you're going to pull inspiration from anywhere, might as well pull it from what you know people already like.</p>



<p>Moving forward, other ways in which Arena Royale mixes an arena shooter and a battle royale is by doing away with any battle royale tropes that get in the way of fights. This manifests with chests opening instantly, a player's loot dropping in a big pile instantly when they die (no going through deathboxes), and most importantly, in its low player count, with only <strong>24 players to a match</strong>, in <strong>six teams of four</strong>.</p>



<p>You also won't find buy stations in any of Arena Royale's biomes, as you're able to upgrade equipment on the fly with money earned by doing damage, racking up kills, and completing events like Split Ball, Firecracker, and Hot Zone.</p>



<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/splitgate-2-relaunch-late-december-1047-games/">Since Splitgate 2 relaunched</a>, unfortunately for the team at 1047 Games, it doesn't seem to have taken off. The relaunch came and went without anyone really noticing. The last time we heard from the team ahead of this update was to try and grab some attention and press <a href="https://wccftech.com/splitgate-dev-responds-to-low-player-counts-steam-charts-dont-measure-fun/">by responding to claims that the game was dead/dying due to its poor concurrent player numbers on Steam</a>.</p>



<p>Making a big hullabaloo about its lacking Steam numbers did not, it may shock you to learn, <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2918300/charts/">give it a boost in player numbers on Steam</a>. While Steam concurrent numbers are never the full picture, they're an indicator that, at least on one platform, Splitgate: Arena Reloaded has been unable to gain any serious traction. If that doesn't change, and if things aren't much better on Xbox or PlayStation, then the next time we see a major statement from the studio could very likely be about the studio and the game shutting down.</p>



<p>The Arena Royale mode and the rest of update 2.2 will arrive this Thursday, on <strong>January 22, 2026.</strong></p>

              <p><span>The </span><i><span>Animal Crossing</span></i><span>-like cozy life sim </span><i><span>Heartopia </span></i><span>is one of the biggest new games on Steam this month. It’s also made with AI-generated content according to a new disclosure by the developers.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><i><span>Heartopia</span></i><span> is developer and publisher XD International’s answer to the question, “What if </span><i><span>Animal Crossing</span></i><span> was a chibi anime?” It dropped on January 17 following a wave of closed betas in both November and December 2025. Concurrent players peaked at over 35,000.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Reviews have been mixed, though. It currently sits at only a 66 percent positive rating on Steam. And many of the negative responses from players on Valve’s platform are taking issue with the developer not disclosing their use of AI-generated artwork in </span><i><span>Heartopia.</span></i></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000661397" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000661397"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000661397">Discord</figcaption></figure> <p><span>“This game contains Generative AI (used to generate the puzzles), which they didn’t disclose until the accusations of it surfaced,” writes user </span><a href="https://steamcommunity.com/id/paruisfree/recommended/4025700/"><span>parupa206</span></a><span>. The use of AI wasn’t made public until </span><a href="https://www.gamingbible.com/news/new-cosy-animal-crossing-gen-ai-053843-20260120"><i><span>GAMINGbible’s</span></i><span> Richard Breslin</span></a><span> emailed </span><i><span>Heartopia’s </span></i><span>UK PR team earlier this week. A statement from the developer appeared on Discord not that long after.</span></p> <p><span>“Monetization Content in Heartopia does not include AI-generated materials,” read part of the message to fans. “Should any AI-assisted content be used in the game in the future, it will be announced in advance. Marketing materials produced outside the game, including those created in collaboration with third-party suppliers, are not covered by the scope of this disclosure.”</span></p>

 <p><span>Since then, </span><i><span>Heartopia’s</span></i><span> Steam page has been updated to include a newly added “AI Generated Content Disclosure” section, which states that “AI is used in the puzzle gameplay to reinterpret and redraw in-game snapshot images” and that AI is also “used in in-game chat to help players understand different languages.”</span></p>

 <p><span>The devs have seemingly not apologized for not disclosing their use of AI-generated assets on Steam in any of the official </span><i><span>Heartopia </span></i><span>channels that I could find, and, given how </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dZMFYb1_MWc"><span>blatantly obvious</span></a><span> its usage appears to be in its puzzle minigame, I’m not sure how they ever thought they’d get away with not disclosing this in the first place.</span></p>

<p>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 was undoubtedly the hottest game of 2025, and now, thanks to the tracking of <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/2025-video-game-awards-season-tracking-and-discussion-thread.1348411/">Rese</a><a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/2025-video-game-awards-season-tracking-and-discussion-thread.1348411/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">t</a><a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/2025-video-game-awards-season-tracking-and-discussion-thread.1348411/">Era, </a>it has been uncovered that the Sandfall Interactive-developed title has surpassed Elden Ring as the top game in history to win the most Game of the Year Awards. 436 outlets have awarded the title game of the year. Elden Ring previously had the record at 429 Game of the Year award wins.</p>



<p>Game of the Year Awards have been awarded to Expedition 33 by outlets such as Geoff Keighley’s Game Awards, Famitsu, GameSpot, IGN, Game Rant, GamesRadar+, and Esquire. Additionally, they were awarded Reader’s Choice Game of the Year awards by the readers here <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-insider-gaming-community-2025-game-of-the-year/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">at Insider Gaming</a>, Destructoid, Game Informer, and more.</p>

<p>As the awards keep rolling in for the game, the creative director behind the game, Guillaume Broche, said in a recent interview with Edge Magazine that the success of the game was a surprise to everyone on their team.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“What really surprised us the most is how much the narrative and cinematics and story resonated with people. This is the thing that’s hardest to quantify, because it’s always something very personal. So the fact that this worked so well, pretty much instantly, this was the thing where we were like ‘Ok, this is one hundred times what we were expecting’,” he said <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/rpg/clair-obscur-expedition-33-director-says-the-french-rpgs-success-was-completely-unexpected-from-pretty-much-everybody-at-the-studio/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">(via GamesRadar+)</a></p>

<p>It hasn’t been all smooth sailing for RPG, however. The Indie Game Awards recently had to disqualify the game after discovering its use of generative AI.
