            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Nintendo has released a fresh update for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a>, with the headline feature for the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Switch 2’s</a> biggest game being the addition of Team Battles to the Knockout Tour battle royale mode.</p>
<p>Knockout Tour throws 24-players into a continent-spanning race, knocking players out four at a time as you pass through regional checkpoints, until there’s just four racing for the finish line. With Team Battles in Knockout Tour, you can now set up a race with two to four teams for 12 v 12, 8 v 8 v 8 or 6 v 6 v 6 v 6 races.</p>


<p>With teams, players are still knocked out at checkpoints with the four lowest-placed racers dropping out, but instead of victory decided by the last player standing, points are now earned by team members based on their final placement – 50 points for first, 40 for second, 35 for third and 30 for fourth, before tailing off to get just 1 point for missing the first checkpoint. The team with the highest total wins overall, and that bonus for the top four will really help!</p>
<p>Now, this isn’t for the matchmade online multiplayer, but is instead a new custom variant that you can set up in a private room, either online or locally. If there are not enough players, then CPU drivers will fill the remaining spots.</p>
<p>Here’s the full Mario Kart World version 1.5.0 patch notes:</p>

<p><strong>General</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Added team races to Knockout Tour when playing in a room during “Online Play” and “Wireless Play”.</li>
<li>The game now supports the Polish language.
<ul>
<li>Note: You can change your selected language using the “Language” setting in the “System” menu of “System Settings.”</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Fixed Issues</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed an issue where the game would sometimes end if a player plays as Kamek on Choco Mountain.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where the displayed rating would sometimes be incorrect when joining “Everyone” in “Online Play” while in a room.</li>
<li>Several other issues have been addressed to improve the gameplay experience.</li>
</ul>

<p>Rebirth and third entry are now in development for Switch 2</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure data-uuid="9b2fa0ecbe9f7"><a title="FF7 Rebirth" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/9b2fa0ecbe9f7/ff7-rebirth.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Square Enix</em></figcaption></figure><p>If you've been keeping up with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade">Final Fantasy VII Remake</a> on the Switch 2, then you'll probably already know that its direct sequel, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth">Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</a>, along with the untitled third entry, will also head to the hybrid console in the future.</p>
<p>Rebirth represents quite a drastic departure from Remake, introducing a vast open world that serves as an almost direct contrast to the tightly-designed environments found in the first entry. This will no doubt sow doubts in fans' minds about just how well it might hold up on the Switch 2. After all, Rebirth's visuals were already noted to have suffered from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=B2rHUbqauUk">a few downgrades</a> at launch when compared to Remake.</p>
<p>From a gameplay perspective, however, fans can expect parity across all systems with Rebirth and the upcoming third entry. In <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-za/News/2026/January/FINAL-FANTASY-VII-REMAKE-INTERGRADE-Interview-Naoki-Hamaguchi-Director-3010151.html">speaking with Nintendo of Europe</a>, game director Naoki Hamaguchi states that the gameplay experience is "exactly the same", explaining that any differences might be "confusing for players".</p>
<p>Here's what he had to say:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"There's not a huge amount of information I can share in terms of future games, but I can reassure players that we’re working on the Nintendo Switch 2 version of Final Fantasy VII Rebirth, the second game in the series, and the third game too. They are being worked on for Nintendo Switch 2 alongside the other platforms right now.</p>
<p>"One thing to reassure the fans who want to play these games on Nintendo Switch 2: I've got a personal policy where I don't want to make any versions of my games different or offer a different gameplay experience just because they're on different hardware. That might get confusing for players, and they might wonder which version of the game they should buy. That’s something I’d very much like to avoid. The Nintendo Switch 2 versions are being developed in a way that keeps the gameplay experience pretty much exactly the same as all the other platforms, so I hope this reassures Nintendo Switch 2 players."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Given that Remake hits the Switch 2 <strong>*checks notes*</strong> <em>today</em>, it seems likely that we won't see Rebirth for a little while yet, never mind the mysterious third entry. We'll be keeping a close eye on any and all developments, however, and let you know as soon as we hear more.</p>
<p>In the meantime, do check <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade">our full review</a> for Final Fantasy VII Remake if you haven't already. We awarded it a score of 9/10, stating that it "makes impressively few compromises" in moving over to the Switch 2.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Konami’s Silent Hill 2 has been brought to life through Return to Silent Hill. The 2026 movie adaptation looked quite impressive in its prerelease trailers and screenshots, and Pyramid Head looks as dangerous as he should, but all the effort appears to be in vain.</p>



<p>The 2024 <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/konami-says-more-silent-hill-remakes-are-in-development/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Silent Hill 2 Remake</a> gave the franchise new life. It recaptured some of the love and nostalgia from the late 90s and early 2000s era. Silent Hill f went in a different but equally compelling direction. It was full steam ahead for a new Silent Hill movie, but unfortunately, Return to Silent Hill has gotten lost in the fog.</p>







<h2 id="h-the-reviews-are-in-for-return-to-silent-hill-and-it-s-not-good">The Reviews Are In For Return To Silent Hill, And It’s Not Good</h2>



<figure><figcaption>The reviews are just as horrifying. Credit to Davis Films, Electric Shadow, Supernix, and WIP.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Currently, Return to Silent Hill has a jaw-droppingly low score of just <strong>6% on <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/return_to_silent_hill" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Rotten Tomatoes</a></strong> based on 17 reviews. There’s a chance more reviews will be added, but it’s hard to see a route back for the movie—and further reviews could bring the score down further.</p>







<p>Critics have described it as a “Massively disappointing adaptation of a classic horror video game,” “An atmospheric, supernatural horror thriller that offers no surprises, thrills or palpable scares,” and “An adaptation that fails to improve upon the source material or do anything particularly new and interesting.”</p>



<p>This makes it the worst-reviewed Silent Hill movie in the franchise, and this isn’t saying much.</p>



<p>The 2006 adaptation with Sean Bean is a Scorsese epic, in comparison, with its 33% Rotten Tomatoes score (and generally isn’t a bad watch), whereas 2012’s Silent Hill: Revelation sees reception plunge to 8%.</p>



<p>Return to Silent Hill beats them all, as it stands. This is likely to affect box office numbers, and it could be the final nail in the coffin for any future Silent Hill movies.</p>



<p>If you already have tickets booked for Return to Silent Hill, please let the community know what you think of it.

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/cdpr-could-spend-up-to-800-million-on-the-witcher-4-its-estimated/</link>
            <guid>1412860</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>An analyst has predicted that CD Projekt Red could end up spending close to $800 million on the development and marketing of The Witcher 4. </p>



<p>The Witcher 4 will be the next big instalment from CD Projekt Red, and we already know it <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/cd-projekt-red-confirms-the-witcher-4-not-releasing-in-2026-new-trilogy-sticking-to-6-year-plan/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">won’t release in 2026</a>. The new trilogy will follow a 6-year plan. As we wait for more news about the title, analysts have predicted the budget that the developers might be targeting for this game. </p>







<h2 id="h-the-witcher-4-could-cost-close-to-400-million-with-an-additional-400-million-to-be-spent-on-marketing">The Witcher 4 Could Cost Close to $400 Million, With An Additional $400 Million to be Spent on Marketing </h2>



<p>The estimate of The Witcher 4 costing $800 million comes from a post on Polish platform <a href="https://strefainwestorow.pl/analizy/noblesecurities-cdprojekt-wiedzmin-dlc-orion-cyberpunk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Strefa Inwestorów</a> (via <a href="https://clawsomegamer.com/analyst-estimates-800-million-budget-for-the-witcher-4-10x-higher-than-cost-of-the-witcher-3/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Clawsome Gamer</a>). The prediction comes from a Noble Securities Analyst, Mateusz Chrzanowski, who has stated that The Witcher 4 could cost PLN 1.4 billion (USD 388 million) to make, and that CDPR could spend a similar amount on marketing, bringing the total cost of the title close to $800 million. </p>



<p>Additionally, the analyst has predicted that the trilogy’s budget has increased from PLN 2.1 billion (USD 583 million) previously to PLN 3.2 billion (USD 861 million). </p>



<p>Additionally, the report discusses the budget and release window for Project Orion (the Cyberpunk 2077 sequel). It seems this title could cost around PLN 1.5 billion (USD 416 million) to develop, largely due to the apparent <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/cyberpunk-2-could-feature-online-multiplayer-new-job-listing-suggests/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">multiplayer integration</a>. This integration has also apparently pushed the release date to Q4 2030, which will be Cyberpunk 2077’s 10th Anniversary. </p>



<p>Readers should note that these are analyst predictions and not official numbers from CDPR, so take this information with a grain of salt. </p>







<p>In other news, CD Projekt Red has <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/cd-projekt-red-adds-senior-baldurs-gate-3-developer-to-the-witcher-4-development/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">brought on a senior Baldur’s Gate 3 developer</a> to The Witcher 4 team.

              <p>If yesterday’s <a href="https://kotaku.com/ubisoft-earnings-layoffs-delays-canceled-ai-2000661869">Ubisoft announcements of cancellations and studio restructuring</a> and promises to focus on gen-AI were intended to win back shareholder confidence, it’s safe to say that’s not <em>really</em> worked out. At the start of trading today, the publisher’s share price dropped to its lowest level in 14 years, a third of their value wiped out overnight, and that’s after years of colossal falls. In fact, an Ubisoft share bought in June 2018 has now dropped in value by more than <em>95 percent</em>.</p> <p>Yesterday, on announcing <a href="https://kotaku.com/ubisoft-cancels-long-delayed-prince-of-persia-remake-black-flag-remake-delay-2000661866">the cancellation of projects like the&nbsp;<em>Prince of Persia: Sands of Time&nbsp;</em>remake</a> alongside other unannounced titles, and a plan to restructure its development studios yet again (in other words, close more of them and fire many more staff), Ubisoft described these actions as introducing “a radically new value-creation model.” It’s certainly proven radical.</p>

 <p>A <a href="https://staticctf.ubisoft.com/8aefmxkxpxwl/59b4Z0RNls45UDTVV6gBNR/801a91a599b337779106af51cf08e539/Ubisoft_Jan_PR_draft_vF.pdf">lengthy statement</a> laid out how Ubisoft plans to redesign its entire structure and “simplify” its operations, all with a goal to create “efficiency” and convince investors that the company is going to stop hemorrhaging money. The plan promised to focus its attentions on turning its established IPs into “annual billionaire brands” while directing its attention toward all of last year’s buzz-words like live-service and “Gen-AI initiatives.” It appears that simply stating that the games that currently don’t make close to a billion dollars a year will now start doing so hasn’t convinced shareholders of the company’s future.</p> <p>At the time of writing, a share in Ubisoft is wavering around $4.30, down from $6.60 yesterday. That’s a drop from a peak of $13.40 last year, and an astonishing plummet from 2018’s all-time peak of $95. Things had stayed hopeful until January 2021 when prices still held to around $83, but then began a steep slope downward that has never let up. This has all occurred alongside <a href="https://kotaku.com/ubisoft-skull-bones-delay-assassins-creed-far-cry-cuts-1849975925">the repeated cancellation of major projects</a>, and <a href="https://kotaku.com/ubisoft-layoffs-division-3-massive-tencent-2000659368">wave after wave of firings</a> of its employees at studios all around the world.</p>

 <p>This endless deckchair rearrangement doesn’t appear to be fooling anyone, and each move has seen prices tumble in response. This morning’s market reaction to yesterday’s latest raft of plans could be the sharpest drop the company has ever seen, unless there’s a skin-of-their-teeth bounce-back later in the morning.</p>

 <p>Still, if you were looking to sell your brand to a private owner, <a href="https://kotaku.com/ea-shareholders-approve-55bn-sale-saudi-arabia-trump-2000655342">as EA is currently attempting</a>, being this colossally incompetent would sure make you look a lot cheaper to interested buyers.</p>

  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p>EA has revealed that one of the most iconic maps from <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/battlefield-4">Battlefield 4</a> is being rebuilt and brought over to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a> as its largest map to date.</p>
<p>That map is Golmund Railway, a massive arena featuring a big ol' train at its centre. Back in Battlefield 4, teams could capture this train as part of the game's Levolution mechanic, moving slowly and offering the controlling team a handy advantage. Fun fact, the Golmud Railway is also based on a real-world railway in China.</p>
<p><a href="https://x.com/BattlefieldComm/status/2014005415114310024">In a post on the official Battlefield Comms social media account</a>, the news was broken alongside a peak at other tidbits coming in the future, including aircraft and vehicle combat systems, gameplay tuning, hit registration. All to come as part of in-development changes for the game's second season, as well as more substantial shifts to come later in the year.</p>

</figure>
<p>In regard to Golmud Railway, the post reads "Golmud Railway is being rebuilt for today's Battlefield, not simply ported forward. Our goal is to preserve what made the map so memorable in Battlefield 4, particularly its combined arms gameplay, while improving how it plays and supports Battlefield 6 systems. Golmud is planned to be the largest Battlefield 6 map to date, giving us the opportunity to expand gameplay on a larger scale.</p>
<p>"We're bringing Golmud into Battlefield Labs early as this will be a multi-session project. Through Labs, we want to test changes such as larger flight space, increased cover for aircraft, and other adjustments as the map evolves over time."</p>
<p>As for when you can expect Golmud to make it into Battlefield 6, there's no word on a release date yet. However, more information on how to take part in early play sessions for the map will apparently be announced at a later date by the Battlefield Comms social media account, so keep an eye out if you're keen.</p>

            <p>Act surprised: the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/forza-horizon-6">Forza Horizon 6</a> release date does appear to be 19th May - a date we're expecting to be announced during <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-developer-direct-2026-time-where-to-watch">this evening's Xbox Developer Direct</a>.</p>
<p>Reliable leaker <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/forza-horizon-6-oui-une-version-physique-sera-bien-prevue-a-cette-date-et-a-ce-prix-on-vous-revele-les-details-du-lancement-60887">Dealabs</a> corroborated the date as well as details about the different editions of the game. This isn't very exciting; there will be a Standard, Deluxe and Premium edition, and a physical version for Xbox Series X.</p>
<p>We've heard this May date before, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/forza-horizon-6s-release-date-might-have-been-revealed-early-and-its-allegedly-coming-sooner-than-anticipated">from a Forza Horizon 6 leak earlier this month</a>, which revealed we'd get an extra Ferrari if we pre-ordered the game. In the game, that is - not a Ferrari not in real life.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/forza-horizon-6-will-be-set-exactly-where-we-expected-it-to-be-set">The open-world setting for this instalment of Forza Horizon will be Japan</a>, but so far we've only seen a cinematic teaser for the game so we could do with seeing a chunk of gameplay footage, which we presumably will, today.</p><p>We also already know that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/forza-horizon-6-will-come-to-playstation-5-but-not-immediately">Forza Horizon 6 will<em> </em>come to PlayStation 5</a>, but this version won't launch alongside the Xbox and PC versions in May. "Forza Horizon 6 will launch first on Xbox consoles and PC in 2026," Microsoft said in a statement in September. "Playground Games and Turn 10 Studios are also working together to bring Forza Horizon 6 to PlayStation 5 post-launch."</p>
<p>Today's Xbox Developer Direct starts at 6pm GMT and we'll be covering it live on Eurogamer.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section>
<figure data-uuid="344fee7dbef72"><a title="Croc: Legend of the Gobbos" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/344fee7dbef72/croc-legend-of-the-gobbos.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Argonaut Software</em></figcaption></figure><p>Poor old <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/croc_legend_of_the_gobbos">Croc: Legend of the Gobbos</a>. The Argonaut Games remaster arrived on Switch on <strong>2nd April</strong>, the very same day that we were all distracted by the monster Switch 2 reveal Direct, and those who pre-ordered the physical edition way back in Oct 2024 <em>still</em> have no idea when it's going to arrive. Talk about a Croc-y start.</p>
<p>The game itself was <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2024/12/croc-remaster-will-miss-its-december-2024-launch-window">delayed</a> back in late 2024. After launch, Rock It Games, the company behind the physical, said that <a href="https://rockitgames.com/blogs/news/croc-update">tariff issues</a> had "made it temporarily difficult to schedule shipments for some items," but things were supposedly back on track. Then, following the release of the game's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/10/crocs-switch-remaster-returns-this-week-with-a-free-platinum-edition-update">'Platinum Edition' update</a> last October, the company pushed things again to get the whole game complete on cartridge — "the unavoidable consequence of this upgrade meant delays in the mastering, approval process and physical manufacture of the disc and cartridge with Sony and Nintendo respectively."</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytC1rrCdi_XjA" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067rqlizn&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>842k</span></a></p>
</div></figure></div>
<p>So, where does that leave things now? In a <a href="https://rockitgames.com/blogs/news/coc-legend-of-the-gobbos-january-2026-update">new blog post</a>, Rock It says that "the delays have been unacceptable," and that going forward, it will be committed to "only offering games once development is complete and our delivery timelines are fully under our control." But there's still no firm release date.</p>
<p>According to the post, the game disc and cartridges have now been approved for production by Sony and Nintendo, Platinum Edition update included, and much of the extra merch found in the beefy Collector's Editions is either complete or arriving in the warehouse by the end of the month.</p>
<p>The thing is, the production updates aren't consistent between posts — one month, items are complete and ready to go, the next, they're not. Mix-ups happen, of course, but those who dropped $129.99 on the Collector's Edition over a year ago are, rightly, after something a little more concrete.</p>

<p>"I have zero trust in Rock It Games because of this," one user wrote on the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CrocLegendoftheGobbos/">r/CrocLegendoftheGobbos</a> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CrocLegendoftheGobbos/comments/1qfs5w9/argonaut_acknowledges_delays/">Reddit</a>, "If they would have just told the truth, and admitted things got screwed up, and didn't go to plan, I would have been disappointed, but understood." Others have been so frustrated with the process that they have already requested refunds.</p>
<p>"We’re confident that the regular and Collector’s Editions of Croc are coming soon," developer Argonaut Games said in an update post on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DTmH2B5FmHd/">Instagram</a>, "We’re as eager to receive them as all of our customers are!"</p>
<p>When exactly "soon" is remains to be seen, but hey, maybe 2026 will be the year!</p>

            <p>Ubisoft’s <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/prince-of-persia-the-sands-of-time-remake-and-more-cancelled-by-ubisoft-with-layoffs-potentially-on-the-horizon">bloodbath of game cancellations and restructuring</a> yesterday has attracted the expected fiery response from unionised workers, with the French game industry union Solidaires Informatique <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:gwmurecu4lbyaqjzsyv2orat/post/3mcxfxwczwk2z">calling a half-day strike today</a>. Cost-cutting and potential layoffs aside, the strikers are protesting against Ubisoft’s decision to mandate a full return to office, with workers given an annual allowance of work from home days instead - something a publisher executive has justified as a move “to enhance collective efficiency” and “the sense of belonging”.</p><!--more-->
<p>Ubisoft management’s latest bout of corpobutchery has seen them bin off six games, including the Prince Of Persia: The Sands Of Time remake, delay seven others, and confirm the closure of Ubisoft Stockholm. </p>
<p>More layoffs will follow, though Ubisoft have yet to share any precise numbers. It’s all part of the company’s Age of Sigmar-esque transformation into a collection of “Creative Houses” <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tencent-hand-ubisoft-a-big-wad-of-cash-to-spin-out-assassins-creed-far-cry-and-rainbow-six-as-a-separate-business">with heavy investment from Tencent</a>, dedicated to a smaller number of hopefully better-selling games – in particular, open world and live service projects, with generative AI dutifully touted as a means of boosting production.</p>
<p>As part of this transition, Ubisoft <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ubisoft-close-the-studio-behind-assassins-creed-rebellion-days-after-the-developers-vote-to-unionise">recently shuttered Ubisoft Halifax</a> (a few weeks after the studio voted to unionise – no connection, they insist) and announced <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/having-asked-division-devs-to-lay-themselves-off-ubisoft-are-now-cutting-55-jobs-at-massive-and-ubisoft-stockholm">layoffs at Tom Clancy’s The Division developers Massive</a>.</p>
<p>In a statement, Solidaires Informatique describe today’s strike as "an initial response to the absurdity of management decisions”, with more action probably to follow. "It is out of the question to let a boss run rampant and destroy our working conditions,” they write, addressing Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot. “Perhaps he needs to be reminded that it is his employees who make the games." The union are also calling for “decent pay rises this year” and “maintaining and extending the teleworking conditions”.</p>
<p>RTO policies are frequently the focus of union action. In October 2024, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/700-ubisoft-staff-in-france-hold-strikes-in-response-to-worldwide-return-to-office-mandate-from-assassins-creed-publisher">700 Ubisoft staff went on strike</a> over a requirement to work in-office three days a week. </p>
<p>Detractors of remote working argue that it’s less efficient and hinders teamwork. As Ubisoft’s senior vice-president of studio operations Marie-Sophie de Waubert told <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/we-want-them-to-be-the-best-in-the-world-in-every-segment-were-in-ubisofts-vision-for-its-new-creative-houses">GamesIndustry</a> yesterday, “the one and only objective [for the new RTO policy] is to enhance collective efficiency, to drive the dynamics, the creativity, the sense of belonging.”</p><p>Advocates for remote working argue that it doesn’t materially affect how much workers contribute, and that it can be vital for people with disabilities, family commitments and other practical challenges that make commuting or sharing office space unfeasible. When EA implemented a partial return to the office in May last year, anonymous staff <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ea-employees-upset-and-confused-at-return-to-office-mandate">offered</a> childcare, medical conditions, and long commutes as reasons for needing an exemption from in-office work.</p>
<p>Advocates for remote working also argue that forbidding hybrid or full remote-working is a “soft layoff” strategy, since some remote workers may have no choice but to move on. That was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/following-mass-layoffs-microsoft-exec-insists-return-to-office-mandate-is-not-about-reducing-headcount">the claim levelled at Microsoft last September</a>, when they imposed a return to the office following thousands of layoffs.</p>
<p>I am very much Team Homeworking, inasmuch as I couldn’t do this job if I had to work in-office 9-5. In general, I think RTO mandates reflect an unexamined belief among managers that people become shirkers and layabouts unless they're kept firmly inside the panopticon.</p>
<p>Arguments continue about RTO beyond Ubisoft. Rockstar’s recent <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rockstar-reportedly-orders-gta-6-developers-to-end-hybrid-working-in-the-name-of-quality-and-polish">implementation of RTO in the name of “quality and polish”</a> is <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/stop-this-from-happening-again-uk-politician-calls-out-rockstar-over-gta-6-developer-firings">one of the reasons some GTA 6 workers chose to unionise</a>, shortly before Rockstar laid off a number of workers for “gross misconduct”, in what British unions have called a case of “union-busting”.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Ubisoft’s shares have plummeted by over 30% today after news of a major restructuring broke. </p>



<p>Ubisoft recently announced a significant restructuring that will focus on a new operating model emphasizing&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisofts-new-model-will-focus-on-open-world-adventures-and-gaas-native-experiences/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">open-world adventures and games-as-a-service (GaaS) experiences</a>. This news has evidently affected the company’s stock, leading to a considerable drop in share value today.</p>











<p>As revealed on <a href="https://www.google.com/finance/beta/quote/UBI:EPA?sa=X&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjyk4Gd_56SAxVsXmwGHf2pLt8Q3ecFKAN6BAghEAQ" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Google Finance</a>, Ubisoft’s shares have decreased by 33.78% today (as of the time of writing). The day began with a share price of 5.26 EUR, which has now fallen to 4.44 EUR. Over the past six months, the shares have declined by more than 50%.</p>



<p>The drop comes immediately after the announcement of an organizational, operational, and portfolio reset, which led to the cancellation of highly anticipated titles like the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-canceled/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Prince of Persia Remake</a>, among others. The restructuring has also led to the closure of multiple studios and layoffs across the organization. </p>



<p>Ubisoft’s new operating model now features a decentralised structure with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisofts-new-operation-model-features-5-creative-houses/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">5 Creative Houses</a>, each divided by distinctive genres. The goal is to make the company “a more gamer-centric organization, structured around creative genres.”</p>



<p>Additionally, their new model will be supported by targeted investments, deeper specialization, and cutting-edge technology, which includes “accelerated investments in player-facing Generative AI.”</p>







<p>In other news, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/exclusive-beyond-good-evil-2-survives-ubisofts-project-purge/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming’s exclusive report</a> reveals that Beyond Good &amp; Evil 2 has survived the latest round of project cancellations. Additionally, the restructure has likely led to the Black Flag remake being <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-flag-remake-delayed-by-up-to-one-year/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">delayed by up to one year</a>.

            <p>Nintendo has released a free update for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a>, which adds team races to its chaotic Knockout Tour mode.</p>
<p>In Knockout Tour, players race to not just win, but to stay in the game at all. If you fail to reach a checkpoint ahead of a set number of others, you will be - as the name suggests - knocked out of the running.</p>

<p>Until now, this had been a solo affair, however Nintendo has now made it so you can race as a team with your friends and family. In the <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/whatsnew/free-update-for-mario-kart-world-lets-you-race-as-a-team-in-knockout-tour/">words of Nintendo</a>: "Buddy up and barrel forward!"</p>
<p>So, how does this new team-based Knockout Tour actually work in practice? Well, it's still going to have 24 racers, but up to four teams can now take part. What this means is that you can expect to see a 12v12 race, an 8v8v8 race, or a 6v6v6v6 race. If you don't have enough players to fill all the spots, then CPU characters pop in.</p><p>The winner at the end of this flavour of Knockout race is then determined not by who finishes first, but by the total points tally of every member in the team. Points are awarded based on the overall placement of each driver on the team, 50 points for first place, 40 for second, 35 for third and 30 for fourth place. Meanwhile, those who finish towards the end of the pack get less points, with the four drivers who fail to make it past the first checkpoint only getting a scant one point to their names.</p>
<p>So, even if you are an absolute racing super star, and make it to that shiny first place spot, your team may overall still fail to claim victory. Meanwhile, if you happen to be knocked out from the race earlier than you may have liked, you can then watch from the sidelines to spur your team mates on.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[‘It’s Our Most Ambitious Game by a Factor of 10’, Says inXile CEO of Clockwork Revolution]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/clockwork-revolution-is-inxiles-most-ambitious-game-by-factor-10/</link>
            <guid>1412806</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>It's been over half a year since we had any update from developer <strong>inXile</strong> on their next game, the steampunk RPG <strong>Clockwork Revolution</strong>. Following a new trailer <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-clockwork-revolution-trailer-revealed-during-xbox-games-showcase-will-launch-on-pc-and-consoles-in-due-time/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shown at the 2025 <strong>Xbox Game Showcase</strong></a> in June, inXile founder and CEO <strong>Brian Fargo</strong> had claimed the game <a href="https://wccftech.com/clockwork-revolution-features-truly-evil-conversation-options-and-multi-person-dialogues/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">would feature 'truly evil' options for players and multi-person dialogues</a>.</p>



<p>Now, Fargo has been featured <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/rpg/clockwork-revolution-could-be-the-most-expressive-xbox-rpg-in-years-with-inxile-aiming-to-bring-the-level-of-reactivity-from-our-isometric-titles-into-something-first-person/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in a new interview published by GamesRadar</a> in which he described Clockwork Revolution as <strong>the studio's most ambitious game</strong> 'probably by a factor of 10', on account of them trying to translate the level of interactivity usually seen in isometric games into a first-person action RPG.</p>



<p>Elsewhere in the interview, Fargo once again stressed the importance of building truly alternative options for players to choose, even if that means creating more content that can be seen in a single playthrough.</p>



<p><em>For me, roleplaying means I can play a role and actually affect the world around me. If all paths lead to the same outcome, the immersion breaks, and you start to feel like you're just playing a game rather than living in one. But when the world is constantly reacting and reflecting your choices, both in big ways and just as importantly in small ways, that's when immersion really sets in.</em></p>



<p><em>We probably build roughly 30% more content than what any player could see in a single playthrough. We want players to be able to approach the game as a different archetype, whether you want to be good, evil, or something in between. Here's what's really important to us: if you don't allow the player to be bad, to really go down those rabbit holes and see the consequences play out, then they never had free will to be good in the first place. They're not choosing to be good, they're just being forced down a path. We think it's essential that players are making that choice, not having it made for them. We also have a very dark sense of humor, which makes all of it even more fun.</em></p>



<p>Clockwork Revolution <a href="https://wccftech.com/clockwork-revolution-is-inxiles-first-person-steampunk-rpg-game-is-still-early-in-development/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was first showcased during the 2023 Xbox Games Showcase</a>. The game doesn't have a release date, so unless Microsoft and inXile are secretly planning a late 2026 launch, we're probably going to have to wait until 2027 to play it. As a reminder, inXile's previous game, <strong>Wasteland 3</strong>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/wasteland-3-nothing-without-providence/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was released in August 2020</a>. </p>



<p>The game is currently announced for <strong>PC</strong> and <strong>Xbox Series S</strong> and <strong>X</strong>, although given Microsoft's multiplatform policy, it's only a matter of time before it eventually lands on <strong>PlayStation 5</strong>, too.</p>

            <p>With their latest Fallout modathon having wrapped up at the close of last year, mod-hosting site Nexus Mods have decided to try something new with their latest event designed to supercharge mod creation around a specific game or theme. Rather than asking folks to submit fresh individual mods like usual, the modathon that's about to kick off is all about putting together chunky multi-mod lists which can overhaul a game in one fell swoop.</p>
<p>These user-assembled modlists, dubbed Collections, are a feature Nexus Mods have been <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/fallout-4s-anniversary-update-didnt-quite-land-with-the-impact-many-hoped-for-so-nexus-mods-have-assembled-their-own">pushing</a> for a number of years now, so it's not surprising they're now serving as the subject of a modathon for the first time.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Set to run from January 26th to February 8th, the <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout-collectionathon">first "Collectionathon"</a> is a Fallout-themed one, with season two of a certain radioactive TV show putting out the remainder of its weekly episodes in the coming weeks.</p>
<p>"We want to see you reimagine the Wasteland in bold new ways, whether that’s by taking one of your favourite games from the series and amping it up or by bringing the world of Fallout to a brand new title," reads the brief from the nexus of modders. "Through survival overhauls, lore-friendly refreshes, or wild experiments, we want to see it all, and whatever your idea, we can’t wait to see your creativity in action!"</p><p>If you fancy getting involved, you'll need to do so via Vortex, Nexus Mods' Windows-only mod manager. As a bit of extra context, Vortex is now the only mod manager the mod hosts are working on, with them having <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/news/15424">announced plans to can development of a multiplatform Nexus Mods App</a> earlier this month. Central to the pitch behind that app was the idea it'd work on the likes of the Steam Deck and PCs running Linux. Though, Nexus Mods haven't totally ruled out that functionality potentially making its way to Vortex further down the line.</p>
<p>"We’re also exploring what Linux support might look like for Vortex in the future," Nexus mods owner Victor Folmann wrote in a post about the decision. "While getting every game and mod working on Linux might not be possible, it’s an area we want to keep evaluating where it makes sense."</p>
<p>While I can see the appeal of curated modlists designed for folks to be able to install in one click, having dabbled a bit with Vortex during my early modding days, I can't say I've ever given one of these collections a proper go. I momentarily considered it when setting up my last <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a> run, but instead chose simply to install manually so I could stick exclusively to mods I wanted and regularly pause to check everything was working as intended as my load order grew.</p>
<p>To be fair, I was benefitting from years worth of built-up knowledge in terms of mod installation and what's out there Cyberpunk mod-wise, so I might simply not be in main target audience for collections at this point. Still, it's a lot of faith to be putting in the people who curate such lists to keep them up to date and regularly tested. Then again, that's arguably the same sort of trust you have to put in mod creators anyway, if you're installing works one-by-one.</p>
<p>As of writing, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fallout-4">Fallout 4</a>'s already got just over <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/games/fallout4/collections?sort=downloads">2,200 collections</a>, while <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fallout-new-vegas">New Vegas</a> <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/games/newvegas/collections">has 961</a>, and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fallout-3">Fallout 3</a> <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/games/fallout3/collections">99</a>. We'll have to see what sort of boost this collection jam gives to those numbers.</p>

<p>The world of Hytale continues to get bigger and better, pushed by regular updates from Hypixel Studios and modders around the world, the latter of whom have revealed work on a significant collab.</p>



<p>Along with the reveal of the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hytale-update-2-patch-notes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">second major update</a> following Hytale’s early access launch, modders have revealed some early work of plans to bring Pokémon into the game, and it looks fantastic.</p>







<h2 id="h-hytale-modders-adding-pokemon">Hytale Modders Adding Pokémon</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Gotta catch ’em all. Image via Pokefind on X</figcaption></figure>



<p>A teaser showcase of completed work from the Pokéfind team was <a href="https://x.com/PokeFindMC/status/2013976180232192067" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">posted on X</a>, revealing models for the Kanto starters and their complete evolution lines, featuring the likes of Blastoise, Charizard, Squirtle, and Bulbasaur.</p>



<p>Pokéfind has already found a home in Minecraft, offering a variety of experiences, including a Pokémon Survival mode, a custom-built Pokémon region, Pokémon Skyblock, and Pokéwars, and the plans are to offer similar experiences in Hytale.</p>



<p>The social media post stated the team behind the mod is “beyond excited” to bring Pokéfind into Hytale, teasing that “big updates” are coming.</p>



<p>No timeline has been shared for when players will be able to jump into the game, and, due to licensing, it’s unlikely the mod will be available on official channels like Curseforge. Instead, additional steps are likely to be required to access the game.</p>



<p>Pokéfind is easy to play on Minecraft, however, so there shouldn’t be any issues for players jumping into the mod when it is made available, and you can keep an eye on the team’s progression in development by following the social media account.</p>

<p>Hypergryph has revealed that Arknights Endfield’s PayPal channel is undergoing maintenance, as reports about hacks have started emerging from players. </p>



<p>The latest free-to-play, sci-fi gacha, action RPG by Hypergryph and Gryphline, Arknights Endfield, released today for PlayStation 5, PC, and mobile devices. However, it seems a significant issue has arisen on launch day, with players complaining that their PayPal accounts are being used to make unauthorised purchases. </p>











<p>Players across <a href="https://x.com/Unreal_Dreamer/status/2014193328430952555" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (formerly Twitter) are reporting hacks involving PayPal purchases in Arknights: Endfield. A user named <a href="https://x.com/Naruvt0/status/2014217652751983045" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Naru</a> has shared information about unauthorized transactions made on a victim’s PayPal account, all linked to Gryph Frontier PTE. LTD. The charges appear in multiple currencies, including USD, JPY, CAD, and EURO, and victims are being charged multiple times for a single purchase.</p>

<p>The official Arknights Endfield <a href="https://x.com/AKEndfield/status/2014188503891099888" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> account has announced that they are currently conducting temporary maintenance on the PayPal payment channel due to reports of issues. Players are advised to use alternative payment methods during this time. The account has also stated that “transactions involving abnormal item delivery or payment deductions will be addressed accordingly.” However, many players in the comments are still expressing concerns about unauthorized purchases.</p>

            <p>In a new interview, Gears of War E-Day creative director Matt Searcy has peeled back the curtain a little on the upcoming prequel to everyone's favourite gory third-person shooter. Namely, that by returning to Emergence Day the original series' vibes will return.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/gears-of-war/with-gears-of-war-e-day-recapturing-the-tone-and-vibes-of-the-original-games-the-coalition-believes-its-upcoming-prequel-has-the-potential-to-be-one-of-the-best-stories-in-the-gears-franchise/">Speaking to GamesRadar +</a>, Searcy spoke at length about what returning to a core moment in Gears history allowed the team to explore: ""This is the story we were excited to tell and so the process has been super energizing. There are touchpoints in the lore for us to build from, but enough room that we get to bring new elements and ideas in.</p>
<p>Searcy elaborates: "Getting to go back to the tone and vibes of the original games, exploring the details of Emergence, and imagining what would happen to a city (and the soldiers protecting it) as monsters poured out from the ground was a great starting point to reintroduce the Locust and these characters"</p>

<p>The game, which will be set in the city of Kalona over the course of a few consecutive days, will focus heavily on the shock of Locust forces popping up and causing havoc for the first time. According to Searcy, it'll be quite an emotionally charged experience as well as an action-packed one.</p>
<p>"Our story is set over consecutive days so that players can become intimate with the city," Searcy states.  "We want them to feel the loss of what was here: the history, the people, and the lives they were living.</p>
<p>"We think it has the potential to be one of the best stories in the Gears franchise, and certainly the most heart and emotion when you're looking at Marcus, Dom, and the origin of the brotherhood that they forge in this game."</p>

<p>There's no time scale as to when the attraction will launch, but those in Japan can at least look forward to the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/pokepark-kanto-the-new-pokemon-theme-park-opens-its-doors-in-february">opening of Poké Park Kanto</a> at Tokyo's Yomiuriland Amusement Park on <strong>5th February 2026</strong>.</p>
<p>In the meantime, we'll keep an eye out any further developments regarding the new Pokémon attraction at Universal Studios. If nothing else, we're expecting to see lots and lots (and <em>lots</em>) of new merch.</p>

<p>Up until launch, there’s been a mystery surrounding Highguard, but some of the best information surrounding the game came from an unlikely place. The full trophy list has been revealed for Highguard, and it looks like there’s going to be a lot to unpack. </p>



<p>When it was revealed as the final game at the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/highguard-devs-didnt-pay-for-game-awards-spot/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">2025 Game Awards</a>, it’s fair to say that people were underwhelmed to see another free-to-play hero-shooter. However, it’s been developed by some of the masterminds behind Apex Legends and Titanfall, so it deserves a fair chance in the spotlight.</p>







<p>If you’re planning on giving Highguard a chance, here’s the full <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-trophy-list-all-achievements-trophies/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Trophy list</a> you can work on completing during the raids. </p>



<h2 id="h-all-highguard-trophies-amp-achievements">All Highguard Trophies &amp; Achievements</h2>



<figure><figcaption>You’ll be doing a lot of shooting. Image via Steam.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Judging by the Trophy list, it doesn’t seem like you’ll need to sink an overwhelming amount of time into Highguard to 100% it. </strong></p>



<p>Considering it’s a multiplayer shooter, you’ll need to perform certain feats during an online match, but there’s nothing outrageous that demands an elite calibre of skill. A lot of them simply need you to complete matches—that shouldn’t be too hard, right?</p>







<p>That’s enough preamble, though. Here’s the complete Highguard Trophy list from start to finish.</p>

<figure><figcaption>Breach! Image via Steam.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Highguard has 33 PlayStation Trophies and 32 Xbox Achievements for you to earn.</strong></p>



<p>As usual, PlayStation has one extra Trophy thanks to its ever-coveted Platinum Trophy, which sadly aren’t available to you Xbox gamers out there. But there’s still a healthy batch of Achievements to grind towards, and none of them seem too intensive. Get them all done, and your Gamerscore should rise by a fair amount. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>You can’t sit still in Hytale before something else changes! Hytale’s founder promised constant improvements, and Update 2 brings new gameplay mechanics, dozens of fixes, and so much more in its January patch notes.</p>



<p>Hytale’s popularity remains strong in its early weeks. This is being helped by the game’s frequent updates and patch notes. Initial changes included adding <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/where-to-find-dinosaurs-hytale-location/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dinosaurs</a>, for example. Hytale Update 2 is another fairly hefty proposition, and there’s much to look forward to and discuss.</p>







<h2 id="h-hytale-update-2-release-date">Hytale Update 2 Release Date</h2>



<p><strong>Hytale founder Simon Collins-Laflamme has said Update 2 is arriving “this weekend,” which means it’ll drop between January 23 and January 25.</strong></p>



<p>To add to this, he’s already confirmed that “Update 3 is already in the works,” and the grind never stops!”<a href="https://hytale.fandom.com/wiki/Simon_Collins-Laflamme#articleComments"></a></p>



<h2 id="h-biggest-changes-in-hytale-update-2">Biggest Changes In Hytale Update 2</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Hunt down the void. Image via Hypixel Studios</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Pickaxe progression and Mining have been reworked, and new Magic is being added to Hytale, along with a host of cosmetic and customization changes. There are also tons of gameplay fixes, balance tweaks, and overall QOL improvements across visual and audio.</strong></p>



<p>It’s a fairly meaty update that targets all aspects of Hytale. Obviously, the standout aspects of Update 2 are the physical gameplay flourishes. New magic will sharpen up and broaden the action, making it even more fun.</p>



<p>Collins-Laflamme recently revealed he <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hytale-founder-unhappy-with-games-mining-outlines-thousands-of-improvements/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wasn’t happy with the state of the game’s Mining</a>, which is why it’s not a surprise to see how it’s been changed in Update 2: “Pickaxe progression reworked: mining speed now scales with pickaxe quality.”</p>



<h2 id="h-all-hytale-update-2-patch-notes">All Hytale Update 2 Patch Notes</h2>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Highguard’s Trophy List has surfaced online, revealing the most information about the game we have received yet, including mechanics, game modes, and more.</p>



<p>The upcoming free-to-play, PvP raid shooter by Wildlight Entertainment, Highguard, was revealed during <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-game-awards-2025-everything-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Game Awards 2026</a>, with a brand new flashy trailer. However, since then, the game’s marketing has been almost nonexistent, with virtually no information revealed 4 days before its release. Interestingly, the Highguard Trophy List is doing the job for them. </p>







<h2 id="h-highguard-trophy-list-reveals-brand-new-details">Highguard Trophy List Reveals Brand New Details </h2>



<p>There is a wealth of information contained in Highguard’s Trophy List, which was discovered on <a href="https://www.exophase.com/game/highguard-psn/trophies/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Exophase</a>. This list covers various aspects of the game, including mechanics, game systems, characters, and more. It mentions features such as Shieldbreakers, Domesplitter, Revivals, Enemy Orbs, Wall Breaking, and Generators. Additionally, the list includes the names of certain weapons, like the BigRig LMG. Furthermore, it highlights other items, including chests, Rare &amp; Legendary items, and more.</p>



<p>The trophy list also goes through all the different types of Wardens in the game, including Assault Warden, Defensive Warden, Recon Warden, Support Warden, and Destruction Warden. Interested readers can check out Insider Gaming’s Highguard Trophy guide <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/complete-highguard-trophy-list-how-to-get-all-achievements-trophies/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>. </p>



<p>Highguard has some big names attached to it, with the creators of Apex Legends and Titanfall working on the title. However, even though the game is set to release on January 26, 2026, the game’s official YouTube channel has just one video: the reveal trailer shown at The Game Awards. Players have been waiting for more information on the title, but it seems the trophy list might have to suffice until release. </p>







<p>In other news, Highguard developers did not pay for <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/highguard-devs-didnt-pay-for-game-awards-spot/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the spot at The Game Awards finale</a>. Additionally, some players suspect that the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/highguard-dead-on-arrival-gamers-fear-a-flop/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">title could flop</a>.

<p>The next star of Fortnite Festival may have been uncovered by dataminers, suggesting that the Pink Pony Club could be on it’s way to the game.</p>



<p>Season 12 in Fortnite, starring LISA, is heading toward a conclusion, having been in the game since November 2025, and the end date of February 5 is right around the corner. Now, it appears her successor has been uncovered.</p>







<h2 id="h-chappell-roan-potentially-coming-to-fortnite">Chappell Roan Potentially Coming to Fortnite</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Pink Pony Club. Image via Itsmeleaky on X</figcaption></figure>



<p>Hints that Chappel Roan is coming to Fortnite have been uncovered by <a href="https://x.com/itsmeleaky/status/2014267037674013053" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Itsmeleaky on X</a>, who uncovered items in the games files that hint towards the pop star entering the fray.</p>



<p>A microphone and drumset have been discovered in Fortnite’s files, but the biggest hint ofall comes from a significant makeover to the beloved Fortnite llama, which appears to have been inducted into the Pink Pony Club.</p>



<p>The design of the llama looks extremely close to the horse that Chappel Roan has utilized in her concerts around the world, and is therefore a direct hint at the collab.</p>



<p>However, <a href="https://x.com/SpushFNBR/status/2014267385348284507" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">SpushFNBR</a>, who shared the image, added that the collab was not confirmed, and, while the items were found in files, the headliner for the next season of Fortnite Festival could be changed.</p>



<p>If Chappell Roan were to star as the headliner of the next Fortnite Festival season, she would add to the library of Jam Tracks in the game, which already includes hits The Giver, Hot to Go, and Good Luck, Babe!</p>







<hr>



<p>Would Chappell Roan be a good choice for the headliner in the next Fortnite Festival season? Share your thoughts in the Insider Gaming Discord.</p>

            <p>Ubisoft's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/prince-of-persia-the-sands-of-time-remake">Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time Remake</a> studio has shared a statement following its game's shock cancellation.</p>
<p>Last night, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisofts-troubled-prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-is-dead-as-publisher-kills-multiple-projects-closes-studios-and-orders-staff-back-to-the-office">Ubisoft announced a "major organisational, operational and portfolio reset"</a>, which saw the company delay seven unspecified projects, close two studios and cancel multiple games. One such game was its Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time Remake, which was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-details-whats-new-in-its-prince-of-persia-the-sands-of-time-remake">unveiled in 2020</a>, and had suffered numerous delays and setbacks since. Then, this week, came the final nail in the coffin.</p>

<p>The team behind Prince of Persia's embattled remake has now shared a few words of its own. Here, the studio acknowledged the cancellation was "deeply disappointing" for fans as well as the development team, however this "does not mean [its] stepping away from the franchise" for good.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/princeofpersia/status/2014018590396105121/photo/1">social media post</a>, Ubisoft's Prince of Persia: Sands of Time Remake studio wrote: "The game holds enormous meaning for fans and for the teams who worked on it.</p>
<p>"While the project had real potential, we weren't able to reach the level of quality you deserve, and continuing would have required more time and investment than we could reasonably commit. And, we didn't want to release something that fell short of what The Sands of Time represents."</p><p>It stated Prince of Persia "as a universe and a legacy" is still important to the studio, and Sands of Time's cancellation does not mean this is the end for the franchise as a whole. Closing, Ubisoft's studio thanked the community for its "passion, patience and love for Prince of Persia".</p>

<p>Many were surprised to learn Ubisoft was pulling the plug on its Sands of Time remake. Recent reports from the company had <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/five-years-later-ubisofts-much-delayed-prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-gets-the-closest-thing-to-a-release-date-yet">the game slated for release during"Q4" of its current financial year</a>, which comes to an end on 31st March. So, in just a couple of months.</p>
<p>In June of last year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/after-five-tumultuous-years-ubisoft-prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-is-now-deep-in-development">the Sands of Time remake was said to be "deep in development"</a>, after the project moved from its original developers Ubisoft Pune and Mumbai to Ubisoft Montreal, where it was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/three-years-on-ubisofts-prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-is-still-in-the-conception-phase">seemingly rebooted from scratch</a>.</p>

			<p>In September 2025, insider <strong>Nate the Hate</strong> (who just won the <strong>'Leaker of the Year'</strong> award as voted by Reddit's GamingLeaksAndRumors) <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth-rumored-launch-2026-xbox-series-nintendo-switch-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shared the rumor</a> that <strong>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</strong>, the second installment in the Final Fantasy VII remake trilogy, would launch this year on Microsoft's Xbox Series S and X and Nintendo Switch 2. It seems <strong>Square Enix</strong>'s plan in this regard hasn't changed, at least according to the insider, who <a href="https://x.com/NateTheHate2/status/2013735117735313739" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmed it on X</a> in response to a follower's question.</p>



<p>If true, it would mean that Xbox and Nintendo gamers are getting both released games in the trilogy in the same year. The first one, <strong>Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade</strong>, is launching today on both platforms. Last month, the publisher <a href="https://wccftech.com/this-is-an-incredible-port-final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade-nintendo-switch-2-demo-leaves-community-stunned-with-near-ps5-visual-fidelity/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">released a free demo</a> that stunned gamers particularly for its great visuals and performance on the Nintendo Switch 2, which <strong>almost looked on par with the PlayStation 5 version</strong>. The developer had previously also <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-series-s-actually-solid-spec-wise-ffvii-remake-developer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">spoken well of the Xbox Series S</a>, saying they had no problem porting FFVII Remake Integrade to the platform, except for a few memory-related challenges. </p>



<p><strong>Porting Final Fantasy VII Rebirth will undoubtedly be more challenging</strong>, though, especially for the Xbox Series S and Nintendo Switch 2. The more recent game has a far larger scope and open world-like environments that will be quite taxing on the CPU, unlike the first game's fairly linear maps. Because of this, a 2026 launch would be all the more impressive, provided it is decently optimized. For comparison, the game <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth-playable-steam-deck/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">is playable on the Steam Deck</a>, but only with some major performance and graphics caveats.</p>



<p>Series aficionados are also waiting with bated breath for news about <strong>Final Fantasy VII Remake Part 3</strong>. Last month, director <strong>Naoki Hamauguchi</strong> <a href="https://wccftech.com/were-almost-at-the-point-when-we-can-share-more-information-about-it-will-final-fantasy-vii-remake-part-3-be-announced-at-the-game-awards/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">teased</a> that it was almost time for its unveiling, and fans thought it would happen at The Game Awards 2025, but it didn't. That said, it could be shown at the next State of Play, whenever that will be. As with previous games, the game will likely launch on Sony's PlayStation 5 first.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[BF Labs Players Will Get First Crack at Testing Battlefield 6’s New Season 2 Map and a BF4 Map That’s Being “Rebuilt for Today’s Battlefield”]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/bf-labs-first-crack-testing-battlefield-6-new-map-bf4-map-rebuilt-for-todays-battlefield/</link>
            <guid>1412734</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>After an <a href="https://wccftech.com/physical-video-game-sales-hardware-sales-november-2025-lowest-in-the-us-since-november-1995/"><strong>extremely strong launch</strong> that carried it</a> to become <a href="https://wccftech.com/arc-raiders-schedule-i-hollow-knight-silksong-battlefield-6-steam-best-selling-new-games-2025/">one of the <strong>best-selling games of 2025</strong></a>, <strong>Battlefield 6</strong> could not have gotten off to a worse start to 2026 than by <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-season-2-release-date-january-update-ea/">delaying the arrival of Season 2.</a></strong> If you can't wait for the entire extra month it'll now take to arrive, then the clear answer is to do everything you can to get into <strong>Battlefield Labs</strong>, as <strong>EA</strong> announced that players participating in BF Labs will get to test out Season 2's new map, <strong>Contaminated</strong>, and everyone's favourite mini helicopter, <strong>Little Bird</strong>.</p>



<p>Those are just two of the main additions coming in Season 2 that BF Labs players will get their hands on first, as EA and <strong>Battlefield Studios</strong> continue to test and tweak things for the upcoming season. In <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/battlefield/battlefield-6/news/battlefield-6-community-update-battlefield-labs-season-2-testing-and-beyond">a blog post on the game's official website,</a> the BF Studios team outlined that the new map falls somewhere between the size of <strong>Eastwood</strong> and <strong>Mirak Valley</strong>. To give you a potentially better idea of how big it is, the team adds that it's "<em>comparable</em>" to maps like <strong>St. Quentin Scar</strong> from <strong>Battlefield 1</strong> or <strong>Arras</strong> from <strong>Battlefield V</strong>.</p>



<p>Contaminated and Little Bird are all that BF Labs players will be testing in the next session EA hosts, but the BF Studios team is quick to point out it'll be doing a lot more testing, and that future tests will be "<em>more exploratory</em>," including testing out different aircraft and vehicle systems. There are also adjustments to RPGs and vehicle interactions incoming, to potentially re-tune how vehicles can respond to RPGs and TOW launchers, and how those weapons impact vehicles.</p>



<p>There are other changes not outlined in the blog post that EA and BF Studios say will arrive in time for Season 2, and there are even more changes that won't arrive until after Season 2. Including the return of a <strong>Battlefield 4</strong> map that EA and BF Studios call a "<em>fan-favorite</em>" map: <strong>Golmud Railway</strong>.</p>



<p>"<em>Golmud Railway is being rebuilt for today’s Battlefield, not simply ported forward," </em>the blog post reads.<em> "Our goal is to preserve what made the map so memorable in Battlefield 4, particularly its combined arms gameplay, while improving how it plays and supports Battlefield 6 systems. Golmud is planned to be the largest Battlefield 6 map to date, giving us the opportunity to expand gameplay on a larger scale.</em>"</p>



<p>"<em>We’re bringing Golmud into Battlefield Labs early as this will be a multi-session project. Through Labs, we want to test changes such as larger flight space, increased cover for aircraft, and other adjustments as the map evolves over time.</em>"</p>



<p>Lastly, EA and BF Studios did bring up the popular topic of a <strong>Solo Queue</strong> for its battle royale mode, <strong>REDSEC</strong>. While there's no indication that it'll be testing Solos in REDSEC anytime soon, the team is still testing it internally to help the team understand "<em>where Solo play can best fit within the broader battle royale roster, including how it affects match flow, survivability, and long-term engagement when featured alongside other battle royale experiences</em>."</p>



<p>"<em>These tests are part of our ongoing effort to make informed decisions about how Battle Royale is structured and presented over time, rather than committing to a single permanent configuration. Any future player-facing testing would be approached with the goal of learning and validation, and we’ll share more details ahead of time if and when those tests are planned.</em>"</p>



<p>Upsetting as it is that we'll have to wait longer than expected for the arrival of Season 2, it's at least good to know what EA and the BF Studios teams are looking to test in the meantime. Now that we're more than a few months into Battlefield 6 being in players' hands, it's also interesting and encouraging to see BF Studios lean on BF Labs like this, so that players get the chance to try out what's coming to the game, and provide feedback that could, realistically, help EA avoid a season so collectively hated that it kills any momentum the game had.</p>
