            <p>We’re only a couple of days away from the early access launch of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/final-fantasy-xiv-dawntrail">Dawntrail</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/final-fantasy-xiv-a-realm-reborn">Final Fantasy XIV</a>’s latest expansion and first in over two years since the climactic Endwalker. As <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/final-fantasy-xiv-dawntrail-is-looking-summer-ready-as-we-explore-the-new-land-of-tural">the summery story expansion</a> prepares to drop, Square Enix have run down everything else arriving in the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-mmos-mmorpgs">MMO</a>’s 7.0 patch, which notably includes its long-awaited graphical overhaul along with several other nice-to-have improvements whether you’re playing Dawntrail or not.</p>

<p>As well as Dawntrail’s story quests, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/final-fantasy-14s-new-cyberpunk-city-has-me-hoping-dawntrail-will-shower-more-love-on-the-series-best-entry">locations</a>, dungeons and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/final-fantasy-14s-new-jobs-bring-a-splash-of-splatoon-and-pokemon-to-its-dawntrail-expansion">new jobs</a> - we won’t spoil anything here - 7.0’s headline feature is a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/final-fantasy-14s-long-awaited-graphics-update-in-70-will-look-better-than-the-dawntrail-benchmark-yoshi-p-promises">total visual overhaul</a> of the now decade-old game. Comparisons in the 7.0 patch notes show just how much sharper we can expect environmental textures to look, with other polishes including more fluid animations, better hair and skin textures on characters, softer shadows and more light sources, and various other additions down to more subtle eye movements, glasses lenses, and effects for water and wind. There’ll be some technical additions too, including support for FSR and DLSS upscaling for AMD and Nvidia users respectively, TSCMAA anti-aliasing and an alternative SSAO using GTAO. Plus DualSense owners can now use the PlayStation controller natively on PC.</p>
<p>In case the graphical changes make your character look a bit different, everyone will be gifted a Fantasia to let them remodel their character for free rather than having to buy one from the real-money shop. Character creation itself has been expanded with new lighting options, combat voice line previews and a 60-minute grace period during which you can hop back in to tweak your appearance without using another Fantasia. There’s some new hairstyles and the option to combine glasses and hats for the first time, too.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/lodestone/topics/detail/027df51f6c2c3d792f33cbc4430ef648e989722d">patch notes</a> are extensive, but a few other quality-of-life changes stand out. The first is especially well-timed given the inevitable rush of players working their way through Dawntrail’s main scenario: you can choose to hide other players around quest-giver NPCs, either when you’re just nearby or when you’re interacting with them. It’s a small but welcome tweak that should help with the mess of trying to click on an NPC amid dozens of fellow Warriors of Light.</p>

<p>The other change is to Final Fantasy XIV’s stealth missions that involve tailing a certain NPC. While there aren’t many in the MMO, the few that are required can be a frustrating exercise in suddenly being spotted and having to restart. Now, NPCs will have a very clear indicator around them that shows whether you’ll be spotted if they turn around, along with a glowing AoE-like zone around them when you need to stay clear.</p>
<p>I’m also personally relieved to see you can now just click on an emote icon in the Duty List when having to perform specific emotes during a quest, rather than typing them out everytime.</p>
<p>There’s plenty more - such as new house furnishings, including a light fitting that looks suspiciously similar to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/final-fantasy-14s-perfect-steamed-bun-animation-puts-its-blocky-grapes-to-shame">Endwalker’s iconic low-poly grapes</a> - all of which will be available once FF14 returns from going offline for maintenance ahead of the new expansion tomorrow.</p>
<p>Don’t forget - as if you need me to remind you - that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/final-fantasy-14-braces-for-dawntrail-login-queues-with-plans-to-limit-travel-and-crack-down-on-afk-players">there’ll be new queue and AFK measures in place</a> to help alleviate the expected server slam caused by Dawntrail’s arrival too, so maybe steer clear for a bit unless you absolutely plan to be making your way through the new expansion and don’t mind waiting a while to get in.</p>

  <p id="1rOjqz">Nothing beats having a new comic book in your hot little hands and settling in for a good read. Fortunately, 2024 has delivered fantastic comics from every side of the industry — and there are lots more on the way. </p>
<p id="VakCfQ">But for now, these are Polygon’s best comics of the first half of 2024. Stay tuned for more!</p>
<p id="aQzuHb">Comics were considered eligible if they were graphic novels published for the first time in 2024 or series that were collected for the first time, or published their final collection, in 2024. Everything on this list is available in paperback or collected form for your eager hands — no worries for trade-waiters.</p>

<p id="Ox1WLk">I’ve never read a cartoonist that makes me feel the space between each panel as strongly as Taiyo Matsumoto. He doesn’t have to fill a page with the buzzing of cicadas or the pulse of a city’s streets for me to hear them in my ear; on a deep instinctual level he knows what two images juxtaposed together will create that ambience, and fill his pages with room tone. He is a master of quiet.</p>
<p id="wZtyMW">There are also few cartoonists as loud as Matsumoto. His distorted figures and grotesquely expressive close-ups are a gonzo hallmark of his work like <em>Tekkonkinkreet</em> or <em>Ping Pong</em>, which makes the still moments in those stories stand out all the more.</p>

<p id="IoJsx6">Yet <em>Tokyo These Days</em> has none of those moments of noisy bravura. It’s a more restrained, somber work, about Shiozawa, a career manga editor who surreptitiously decides to quit the business. Yet before he fully settles into retirement, he gives himself a final to-do list: to meet with several struggling cartoonists he used to work with and ask what happened to the love and passion that once lived in their stories, to see if there is any bit of romance left in the medium that wrung them all out. Burning out has never looked so beautiful. —<em>Joshua Rivera</em></p>

<p id="wYN2YC">Skybound Entertainment’s stealth launch of an interconnected G.I. Joe/Transformers setting was one of the best-kept comic book secrets of 2023. What has become clear as the Energon Universe has rolled out, however, is that <em>Transformers</em> is among 2024’s best comics set in <em>any</em> interconnected brand universe. </p>
<p id="ojPMOV">Daniel Warren Johnson’s <em>Transformers</em> is a war comic where the tanks and planes can punch and kick and vertical suplex each other off of cliffs — and it’s some of the most beautiful action put on the page this year. There’s more of a sense of scale and weight in any given panel of <em>Transformers</em> than there is in the whole of a Michael Bay movie. And when it comes to implied motion in a static image, Johnson is simply one of the best in the business.</p>

<p id="xx7XCu">But for a book that’s 90% the wildest “giant robots that can turn into cars and planes” action you’ve ever seen, the stakes are as small and personal as the families of precocious teens Spike and Carly. The real miracle of <em>Transformers</em> is how Johnson keeps it all pinned to an emotional ground — and when the fights are so good, that’s saying something. —<em>Susana Polo</em></p>

<p id="Up9JxM">There is a tendency to overrepresent the contribution of writers in discussions about comics, especially when they loom as large as Jonathan Hickman. So it’s something that <em>Doom </em>doesn’t<em> </em>even open with his words, but with late rapper MF Doom’s. “Living on borrowed time/The clock ticks faster” begins the stand-alone one-shot, cribbing the opening bars of “Accordion,” a track off the era-defining album <em>Madvillainy</em>. It’s a good tone-setter: The writer, like the reader, is just along for the ride. </p>
<p id="DdMvbz">The wonderfully kinetic artist/writer Sanford Greene is the MC here, setting the stage for a story about the greatest villain in the Marvel Universe at the end of everything. This wouldn’t be the first story about Doctor Doom as the last man standing between a version of the Marvel Universe and a Galactus gone mad — but it is perhaps the most thrilling. <em>Doom</em>’s lean, mean script sets the stakes as big as they come, and then gets out of the way to let Sanford Greene absolutely rip, folding the character’s entire history into one cosmic battle. His linework is unrestrained chaos fitting the story’s scope, with Greene and colorist Rachelle Rosenberg rendering the end of the world in magenta and green.</p>

<p id="W4nVjq">In a fallow era for American superhero comics, <em>Doom</em> is a goddamn meteor streaking across the sky, with metaphors made flesh wrestling above all of existence. The magic trick Greene and Hickman pull here is a very old one, when you think about it. Here it is, the bare minimum of what a good superhero comic should be, spun into one of the coolest damn books you can read. Straw spun into gold. —<em>JR</em></p>

<p id="ZSyEw3">In 2017, Emil Ferris’ debut graphic novel, <em>My Favorite Thing Is Monsters</em>, exploded out of nowhere to become one of the most acclaimed books of the 2010s. Presented as the spiral notebooks of Karen Reyes, a precocious grade schooler who loves art and creature features, the comic was dazzling in its voice and density. Through Karen’s monster-obsessed eyes, Ferris gave readers a vivid ballpoint-pen portrait of ’60s Chicago and its sex workers, queer and BIPOC denizens, and related outcasts as Karen attempts to solve a murder and uncovers a family secret. </p>
<p id="TC5QIH">The first half of a two-volume work, <em>My Favorite Thing Is Monsters</em> spent seven years suspended on a cliffhanger as a dispute <a href="https://www.vulture.com/article/my-favorite-thing-is-monsters-author-emil-ferris-interview.html">between Ferris and publisher Fantagraphics</a> kept the fate of <em>Book Two</em> in limbo until now. Ferris’ struggle to publish this voluminous work has not been in vain — <em>My Favorite Thing Is Monsters Book Two</em> is as awe-inspiring a conclusion as its predecessor was an opening act. </p>
<p id="QB5RtF">Following the template set by the first volume, Karen’s journals depict a girl dealing with tumultuous change within and without, in parallel with the city around her. Under Karen’s pen, fictitious monsters are a comfort as she comes to grips with a life more perilous than she realized, one haunted by gangsters, crooked cops, and killers that threatens to swallow her and her older brother Diego alive. Answers to the questions posed in the first act elude her in the second — and the ones she does find are overwhelming.</p>

<p id="ngARxt">Ferris has done something incredible in these two volumes. She’s crafted a coming-of-age story like no other, a comic that considers the ways we have made monsters out of the innocent so monstrousness can run rampant, and funneled all through the pen of a 10-year-old unaware she’s experienced a lifetime of horror. She draws herself as a little werewolf to cope, but also maybe to inspire. There are good monsters and bad monsters, and it’s on us to decide which we’re going to be. <em>—JR</em></p>

</p>
<p id="g3yHal">A crime drama lives or dies on its tone, and a detective series lives or dies on its hook — and <em>Newburn</em>, a modern noir crime drama with the structure of a detective series, lives quite well indeed. </p>
<p id="s3Rrkt"><em>Newburn</em>’s tight two-volume story<em> </em>introduces Easton Newburn, private detective, as he takes on an apprentice partner. The twist is that Newburn doesn’t work for just anybody: He’s the neutral party that all of New York City’s organized crime families depend on to get to the real truth. Writer Chip Zdarsky spins up a cadre of murder mysteries where the answer is never just whodunit but “who’s gonna pay for it without throwing the city into gang war,” while artist Jacob Phillips’ understated colors and linework belie just how talented you have to be to make a book with this many conversations feel tense and dynamically staged. </p>

<p id="hAwWNN"><em>Newburn</em>’s<em> </em>marriage of crime comics and the odd-couple detective duo slides easily into the most compelling questions of both genres: This detective is the best at what he does, but has he left his humanity behind him?

<p id="w2akOY">In addition to streaming movies like <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23068332/top-gun-maverick-review-tom-cruise"><em>Top Gun: Maverick</em></a> and <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23674416/dungeons-and-dragons-movie-honor-among-thieves-role-play"><em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Honor Among Thieves</em></a>, Paramount Plus with Showtime is also the home to culty favorites like <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/22553973/evil-season-2-review-paramount-plus"><em>Evil</em></a>, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24065955/sonic-knuckles-tv-series-paramount-plus"><em>Knuckles</em></a>, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/entertainment/22865685/yellowjackets-theories-lost-cliffhanger-twist-showtime"><em>Yellowjackets</em></a>, and <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23955524/the-curse-nathan-fielder-a24-show"><em>The Curse</em></a>. If none of those titles grab your attention, remember that Paramount Plus is also the home for the entire Star Trek franchise as well.</p>
<p id="v4Gcsb">While getting rid of ads is the most obvious advantage of signing up for the Showtime bundle, the Premium plan also allows you to download content to your mobile device for offline viewing. Considering this deal is the same price you’d usually pay for a year of the ad-supported Paramount Plus Essential plan, there’s an advantage to giving this deal a look before Paramount Plus raises its prices at the end of the summer.</p>

You can also put a weapon on your car and use the turret to damage enemies until you’ve completed the challenge. Or you can simply hang out the window and shoot your gun at someone.

<p>Have you ever noticed that some of the largest AAA games on the market are announced earlier than before? How it always feels that when  a big game is revealed, it’s still five, six, or seven years off at least? It’s something that many wonder why and now one prominent developer is giving his insight into what that reason could be.</p>



<p>Mark Darrah is known for being the creator of the Dragon Age series and is currently working as a consultant on the new Dragon Age: The Veilguard. He also has his own YouTube channel where he <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NK0vKRf0_c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">recently addressed the topic</a> of why AAA games take so long to release.</p>



<p>While the nearly 25-minute video is worth a full watch for the insight from Darrah, one thing he said that really stood out has to do with a potential fear within the studios making the games.</p>



<p>“There might be reasons why it’s important for the studio or the publisher to have that game in the public consciousness,” Darrah said. </p>



<p>“It might be because the publisher’s slate is a little weak, and they want the public to remember it still has important games in its back pocket. It might be because the studio wants the game announced because they’re worried the publisher might kill it otherwise.”</p>



<p>He added that it’s not usually the best strategy for building up attention and hype for the game.</p>



<p>Aside from that possible fear, Darrah says that just because a studio says it’s working on a game, that doesn’t mean it’s full effort or focus is on that game when it’s announced.</p>



<p>“Studios can kind of be misleading on this front, because they’ll say things like ‘we’ve started work on Elder Scrolls 6’, or they might even a trailer for the game even though the current team size is under 10 people,” he said. </p>



<p>“So they’re giving the impression that this is parallel development, that the team is working on this game, when in fact it’s a few people having a few meetings, and not much is being done.” </p>



<p>There’s also the likelihood that when games are 10 or so years apart, no work is likely being done on that game for the first few years.</p>



<p>On top of this fear, other factors that go into it are things like the size of the game, the team working on it, a focus on more intricate features, and more.</p>



<p>You can watch his full video on the topic below. Again, it’s highly recommended.</p>

While another sequel doesn't seem to be on the horizon, the original game is getting a second redo in Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster.</p><p>Capcom announced the new remaster alongside a teaser trailer that brings back the series' original protagonist, Frank West. But unlike the 2016 HD remake of Dead Rising, the Deluxe Remaster appears to be a completely updated take on the 2006 game with a look that's closer to Capcom's Resident Evil remakes from the past few years.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9aL8m3OaJ2g" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/9aL8m3OaJ2g" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Although there's no gameplay in this teaser, the core premise of the title appears to remain the same. Frank is a photojournalist who is looking to get the story of a career by dropping into a zombie-infested mall for 72 hours. Presumably the remaster will once again allow Frank to deal with the zombie hordes in his own inventive fashion, while adding a few new tricks to his arsenal.</p><p>Capcom hasn't announced a release date for Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster, but it will be coming to the current generation of consoles. And if this return to the franchise is successful, perhaps we'll finally get Dead Rising 5 some time down the road.</p>

			<p>Borderlands 3 free Epic Game Store</p>		</div><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>The July 2024 <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/ps-plus">PlayStation Plus</a> monthly games have been revealed, and PS Plus subscribers – across all of Essentials, Extra and Premium – are being taken to the Borderlands with this trio of games.</p>
<h2>What are the PS Plus June 2024 games?</h2>
<p>The following three games will be available from the first Tuesday of the month, 2nd July.</p>


<ul>
<li><strong>Borderlands 3</strong></li>
<li><strong>Among Us</strong></li>
<li><strong>NHL 24</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/borderlands-3">Borderlands 3</a> saw the long awaited return of the co-op looter shooter, with another blast of, well…. blasting stuff to smithereens! Jason said in <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/09/18/borderlands-3-review/">our review</a> that “I like it and it’s fun to play, but it could have been so much more and the writing feels like time traveling back to your high school days and being surprised and a little disappointed at how immature everyone is.”</p>

<p>If you enjoy your time with Borderlands 3 from the monthly collection, and are subscribed to PS Plus Extra or Premium, then make sure to also check out <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/03/30/tiny-tinas-wonderlands-review/">Tiny Tina’s Wonderlands</a> which is in the PS Plus Catalogue. It struck a much better writing and humour balance for Jason.</p>

<p>Following on from that is a game that’s really rather sus. The social gaming sensation <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/among-us">Among Us</a> is being chucked onto PS Plus to get more people chasing each other round, doing tasks on space ships and pointing fingers at one another when someone ends up being found dead.</p>

<p>And finally we have another of EA’s sports games, which might help you feel a little bit cooler as we get waves of hot summery weather. NHL 24 will let you take to the ice rink with the latest take on pro ice hockey.</p>
<p>So, what do you think of this month’s games?</p>
<h2>Can you still get the June 2024 PS Plus games?</h2>
<p>You can still grab June’s titles up until the new set of game’s arrives on 2nd July, so make sure to grab one of the best beat ’em ups of recent times!</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>SpongeBob Squarepants: The Cosmic Shake</strong></li>
<li><strong>AEW Fight Forever</strong></li>
<li><strong>Streets of Rage 4</strong></li>

            <p>
Dragon Age creator and BioWare veteran Mark Darrah has discussed some of the reasons why big-budget games seemingly take so long to make - and why some projects are announced so long before they're ready to release.
</p>
<p>
Darrah, a veteran of BioWare back to the original Baldur's Gate, previously headed the Dragon Age franchise and returned to work on the upcoming entry Dragon Age: The Veilguard as a consultant. 
</p>
<p>
Speaking via his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8NK0vKRf0_c">YouTube</a> channel, Darrah provides some interesting insight on the topic of big-budget game development. And, while he avoids namechecking any of BioWare's games directly, it's not difficult to read between the lines at certain points as to how this wisdom relates to the company he's spent most of his career at.
</p>

</p>
<figcaption>Dragon Age: The Veilguard reveal trailer.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NXKsoC12JCY" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>
To begin with, Darrah counters the question of why AAA game development takes so long by simply saying that it doesn't - or at least, it doesn't take as long as you might initially believe. In practice, various games get announced well in advance of full development taking place, with only small teams working on pre-production or ideation for several years.
</p>
<p>
"There might be a small nascent seed of a team, but really there isn't any work being done for quite a long time," Darrah notes. "Studios can kind of be misleading on this front, because they'll say things like 'we've started work on Elder Scrolls 6', or they might even a trailer for the game even though the current team size is under 10 people. 
</p>
<p>
"So they're giving the impression that this is parallel development, that the team is working on this game, when in fact it's a few people having a few meetings, and not much is being done."
</p>
<p>
As a reminder, BioWare released its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/new-mass-effect-teaser-shows-series-will-return-to-milky-way">first teaser trailer for Mass Effect 5</a> in 2020, even though the bulk of BioWare has been busy working on Dragon Age: The Veilguard in the meantime. BioWare has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mass-effect-5-teaser-image-revealed-and-analysed">updated fans with fresh concept art</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bioware-teases-mass-effect-5-title-plus-answers-to-trilogy-ending-questions">other visuals</a> each year - but it's clear the game is still nowhere near launch.
</p>
<p>
"There might be reasons why it's important for the studio or the publisher to have that game in the public consciousness," Darrah continues. "It might be because the publisher's slate is a little weak, and they want the public to remember it still has important games in its back pocket. It might be because the studio wants the game announced because they're worried the publisher might kill it otherwise."
</p>
<p>
Announcing projects early isn't the best strategy, Darrah continues, but sometimes "needs must". 
</p>

<p>
The full video, above, is worth watching to hear more of Darrah's thoughts on what holds up big budget games from being made, including the growth in size of open-world or live-service projects in scope (and therefore the need for bigger, more cumbersome teams of people making them), a push from publishers for greater iteration and a "fidelity death cult" where projects have to continue pushing the bar in terms of visuals.

            <p>Sony has announced next month's PlayStation Plus games, and headlining July's PS Plus lineup is shooter-looter Borderlands 3.</p>

            <p>
The thing everybody forgets about Sisyphus is that he was an absolutely awful bastard who deserved everything he got. Prior to being the guy who has to push a boulder up a hill for all eternity, Sisyphus was a crafty Ephyran tyrant who used to murder his guests for kicks, and who once fathered children with his own niece in a bid to depose his own brother. Charming! The Ancient Greek gods were outraged both by the king's violation of the norms of hospitality, and by his general insistence on being too clever by half - and I feel a similar way reading the Xitter feed of Bashir "ManliestDev" Kashalo, who is making a game in which you play as Sisyphus after his eventual demotion to Hell's chief rock-pusher. 
</p><!--more-->
<p>
Kashalo has come to <a href="https://x.com/manliestdev/status/1805269658448146898">"hate"</a> playtesting the game, jovially titled Pushing It! With Sisyphus, whose <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2899090/Pushing_It_With_Sisyphus/">Steam page</a> promises "levels of frustration not previously thought possible". He's just really sick of that boulder. Waiter! Please fetch me the world's smallest violin, grind it to a paste and gently spoonfeed it to the developer who is weary of the game he consciously and deliberately decided to make about the experience of infinite failure. I'm sure no other video game developers can relate.
</p>
<p>
Kashalo is, of course, not being serious and neither am I. I think Pushing It! With Sisyphus looks hilarious. I also think it's hilarious that it's not even the only Sisyphus sim on the store. The others include 2D precision platformer <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1634190/SISYPHUS/">SISYPHUS</a>, in which Sisyphus is a low-key ninja with the power of time manipulation, and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2904890/The_Game_of_Sisyphus/">The Game Of Sisyphus</a>, perhaps the most polished of the currently available Sisyph 'em ups, which, when I discovered it, had a "mostly positive" rating on Steam. 
</p>
<p>
You might think that "overwhelmingly positive" would be funnier, but the thing I love about "mostly positive", without reading the individual reviews, is that it implies a level of good-humoured debate and some carefully considered reservations at the level of both premise and execution, because after all, one player's eternal punishment is another player's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/diablo-4-best-class">Diablo 4</a>. Perhaps if the boulder had ray-tracing it would have squeaked into "overwhelmingly positive" territory. 
</p>
<p>
And then there's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2732980/Capybara_The_story_of_Sisyphus/">Capybara: The Story of Sisyphus</a>, in which Sisyphus is a capybara roped to a barrel, and the goal is to have a bath on top of the mountain. This particular incarnation of Sisyphus has Wild West levels and what's more, "if you suddenly fall off the mountain, there's a small chance you'll end up on the roof of a steampunk building!" I feel the spirit of the original myth has been lost, somewhat, but then again the capybara doesn't appear to have been a mass-murderer and would-be fratricide in her previous life - she's just "lazy". Perhaps becoming a capybara roped to a barrel and in sore need of a wash was the Olympian punishment for sloth? In fairness, this isn't worlds away from the average Aristophanes play.
</p>
<p>
What can we learn from this strange outbreak of Sisyphus games, which extend beyond explicit adaptations to widely influential Sisyphean works like Bennet Foddy's Getting Over It, the recent <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/we-tried-to-escape-hell-in-chained-together-and-one-of-us-kept-running-ahead-with-no-warning">Chained Together</a> and whole genres, like the endless runner? I dunno, but there's probably a wonky op-ed in how these games symbolise an entertainment form that has given itself over to cycles of indirectly monetised futility that wear the label of "progression system". In the eyes of investors and CEOs, every game needs to be a mountain without a summit. I'll say this for Sisyphus games, though: they make for brilliant streaming fodder. If you've got an hour to burn, you could do worse than watch one of Northernlion's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hNNwBl7YmAc">fully narrated, surprisingly chill videos about his experience of Stygian torment</a>. Perhaps Bashir Kashalo would find the footage restful too, once he's done digesting that violin.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dead-rising-deluxe-remaster-gets-surprise-announcement-2024-release-and-controversial-frank-west-redesign.912015/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/dead-rising-deluxe-remaster-gets-surprise-announcement-2024-release-and-controversial-frank-west-redesign/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Right out of nowhere, with no leaks or rumors or even official teases, CAPCOM has published a trailer for Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster. It's an updated version of the first game in the franchise, originally released for Xbox 360 in 2006. It will be released for 'new generation platforms', which clearly includes PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series S|X (and hopefully PC, too), at some point in 2024.</p>
<p>It does seem to be more than your average remaster (hence the Deluxe moniker) since the visual uplift is pretty significant. However, the main character, Frank West, has clearly suffered a bit of a facial redesign, and I have a feeling it may be a bit controversial.</p>


<p><iframe title="Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster Teaser Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xyZ7gagpgsU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Anyway, as a long-standing franchise fan, I really appreciate the return of Dead Rising. The original game was very fun, and its time-sensitive mechanics also made it unique compared to many modern games. The last game in the series, Dead Rising 4, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/dead-rising-4-review-jolly-hacknslash/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">launched</a> in December 2016 without any of those time-based systems and was the worst for it.</p>
<p>As you might remember, CAPCOM Vancouver was making Dead Rising 5 between 2016 and 2018, but the home office in Japan decided to ax it and <a href="https://wccftech.com/dead-rising-capcom-vancouver-shut-down/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shut down the studio</a> after spending around $40 million on the project.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://wccftech.com/capcom-vancouver-wanted-to-make-new-dino-crisis-dead-rising-5-before-shutting-down/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a report by Liam Robertson</a>, the game would have taken place in Santa Catarina, Mexico, between the events of Dead Rising 2 and 3, and would have featured Dead Rising 2 protagonist Chuck Greene.</p>
<p>Dead Rising 5 would have been powered by Epic's Unreal Engine 4, which wasn't nearly as refined then as it is now, and reportedly posed some serious development challenges for CAPCOM Vancouver as they tried to make an open-world title with massive zombie hordes roaming around, as is customary for the Dead Rising franchise. At one point, the developers even considered switching from the usual bombastic and cheesy Dead Rising atmosphere to something much more serious.</p>
<p>Perhaps CAPCOM, which is in a much rosier financial situation nowadays, is testing the waters with this Deluxe Remaster to possibly greenlight a brand new installment in the franchise. One can hope, anyway.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/dead-rising-deluxe-remaster-trailer-revealed/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>One of the best zombie apocalypse titles of all time is being remastered – Dead Rising. It was first released way back in 2006, with an HD remaster dropping in 2015. Now, in 2024, the ‘Deluxe Remaster’ is set to land on the Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 5, and PC later this year. In a short teaser trailer posted today, Capcom showcased a brief snippet of the refreshed game that turned so many heads almost twenty years ago.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-dead-re-rising">Dead Re-Rising</h2>



<p>Dead Rising kicked off a series of open-world zombie apocalypse titles that would come to dominate the genre for almost two decades. With unparalleled levels of visceral, zombie-slaying action, bigger hordes than any other game, and more bizarre weapons than you could ever dream possible, the Dead Rising franchise has well and truly left its mark in the gaming history books.</p>



<p>The last Dead Rising game was released in 2016, and while it wasn’t as big a hit as previous games, it enjoyed its fifteen minutes of fame quite nicely. Since then, the series has gone quiet – aside from a few leaks concerning <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dead-rising-5-cancelled/">a cancelled Dead Rising 5 project</a> over the last year or so.</p>



<p>Now, Capcom is prepping a little fan service by teasing Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster:</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster - Official Teaser Trailer" width="1200" height="675" src="about:blank" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WgdRaicE0nw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>







<p>Fans were quick to note that it’s not the original voice actor playing Frank, which is a sticking point, but it should be easy enough to overlook when they’re charging around Willamette’s mall, cracking skulls with all kinds of inane weaponry and trying to beat the clock.</p>



<p>It wasn’t confirmed when Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster is being released, only that it’s dropping this year.</p>

There, I said it. To date, I’ve logged over 300 hours (while listening to countless podcasts and audiobooks, sorry audio team), having only started the game several months ago on Xbox Game Pass.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As a Writer and Narrative Designer at Sticky Brain Studios, I was testing out some games as research for our next unannounced title. I only delved into </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Coral Island</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> after rage quitting </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Stardew Valley</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> (I know, my team’s Animation Director/next game’s Concept Creator </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/ejoanlee-illustration/">E. Joan Lee</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> finds this </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>hilarious</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">). Sometimes, it really boils down to aesthetics and explaining how to get started.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">From what my colleagues tell me, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Coral Island</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> is remarkably similar to </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Stardew Valley</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Coral Island</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">’s main story quest is clearing the ocean of garbage and uncovering beacons that pierce through and dissolve an oil spill-like root that is poisoning the island and surrounding ocean waters. It gets a bit monotonous (hence me with the audiobooks), so it makes sense to also have the farming sim part, plus peppering the gameplay with NPC interaction and collection.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I love a game with crafting quests and resource management. I also spent ages playing </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Mineko’s Night Market</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> … twice. I love that</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span> Coral Island</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> also has a racially diverse range of NPCs, and with its Indonesian studio/development team, it skews East Asian, so things like the Harvest Moon festival, mooncakes, the Cherry Blossom Festival, and Indonesian foods are featured. It’s a visually stunning experience, with such attention to detail that I never thought running through a field of digital cauliflower on a windy day could be so freaking satisfying.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I haven’t yet had the opportunity to </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>work</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> on a game with such an extensive play time, but as game developers, I feel like we’re always searching for the things that make for compelling gameplay. And while I don’t share the same love of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Minecraft</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> with my children, in which they’ve logged far longer than my measly 300+ hours of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Coral Island</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, I feel like an articulated list of key considerations might be helpful, and could have been alternately titled as, “Maximizing the Feeling for Getting Fantastically Lost in a Game World: A Narrative Designer’s Wish List”.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Customizing your character’s aesthetic look and player name </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">goes a long way in making the player feel like they’re part of the story world. Every time an NPC says, “Thank you, Deb!”, I’m like, “You’re welcome, NPC, whose name I wouldn’t remember if it wasn’t in the character name label.” Player agency over how </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>they</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> appear can often deepen their connection to the game.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Ensure that there’s a purpose for all dialogue</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. For all the effort that goes into planning, writing, crafting choices, asset creation, animation, coding, and localization – don’t give players a reason to skip any of it! Use dialogue interactions and cut scenes to:</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">- Provide hints;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">- Add depth to the story; and</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">- Direct players to find or build up to crafting items for a longer quest -- which should then be an actionable item that adds to a quest list, and not just a suggestion.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Highlighting key words in the text would be helpful in identifying their importance. </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Mineko’s Night Market</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> does a really great job of this. I found myself taking paper notes, but my Certified Accessible® Player Experiences Practitioner self would recommend working this into a quest journal of sorts.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Meaningful interactions with NPCs</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> deepen the game’s feeling of immersion. I haven’t played the Steam version of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Coral Island</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> where you can form romantic relationships with NPCs, so I can’t speak to that. But having heard thirdhand that dialogue can run out with your spouse, I would venture setting the default dialogue to something like, “I love you! My days are so much happier with you in my life.”</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Give options to delve into deeper subjects</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> for run-of-the-mill platonic conversations that can then be attached to something like a collector quest.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Example:</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">NPC: Hello [player name input]! How are you?</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>You</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">: Great! How are you, [nonplayable character’s name]?</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">NPC: I could be better.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>You</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">:</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Option 1</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">: I don’t have time to talk right now, but let’s talk later.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">NPC: Sure thing.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>OR</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>You:</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Option 2</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">: Why? What’s going on?</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">NPC: My mom and I fought this morning. It’s my fault. I know a simple apology won’t work. I was thinking about trying to make her this special cake from her childhood she loves so much. But I don’t know where to find any pumpernickelodeonspongebobpantsie flowers.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It’s an opportunity to unfold more of the story and develop characters, especially when players feel more invested while contributing to the story.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Item/craft quests should offer more significance than a mere errand.</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Example:</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Accept pumpernickelodeonspongebobpantsie quest: Yes / No</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Coral Island</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> has </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>beautiful</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> set dec, such that players can enter almost every NPC’s delightfully furnished home. Other than for the currency reward, which at this point in the game, I don’t need, it feels like a lot of effort to find or harvest the requested item, track down the NPC, give them the item, have them acknowledge it, and then there’s no other interaction or mention of it.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Previous interactions are reflected in future interactions.</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Example:</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">After completing the pumpernickelodeonspongebobpantsie flower quest, dialogue alludes to the NPC’s healed relationship with their mother, thanks to your efforts.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Anything new really hypes that reward instinct.</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I don’t think I really need to elaborate on this, but getting a magical greenhouse or discovering merpeople was worth the lack of sleep and staying up a little, nay … a </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>lot</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> longer.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Understanding that the revenue model varies for such games, I do realize that my playing a premium download sim game carries a finite amount of gameplay and there is no obligation on the developers’ part to extend that past a main storyline. The thing is that many games are scoped with collector quests that </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>offer</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> the kind of extensive gameplay whether the Player feels like it’s grinding or just a fun place to chill and go fishing. But in the sea of games offering </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>very similar</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> types of experiences (like the upcoming </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/VcOeBW92ioU">Hello Kitty Island Adventure</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> with its beach, mines, recipes, room decoration, etc.), creating emotionally meaningful connections go a long way in crafting a memorable experience. And that’s something every studio wants … at least until it’s time to release a sequel.</span></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p>Now I know what you are thinking, didn’t we have a remaster of Dead Rising back in 2016?&nbsp; Yes we did, but Capcom have announced a Deluxe Remaster which goes above making the game run on modern platforms and at a higher resolution.</p>
<p>It looks like all the graphics have had a major overhaul with Frank West now looking rather more haggard and rather older, gone are the luscious brown locks and in comes a rather scruffy, greying haircut.&nbsp; It also appears he has a new voice, fans have quickly noticed that it is not TJ Rotolo.</p>

<p>There is no other information about the game, the YouTube description just says “Hello? Is this thing on? This is Frank! Frank West! Is anyone out there? Grab your camera and prepare for the big scoop on Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster. Stay tuned for more info soon.” However, with Gamescom round the corner this does seem to be just the sort of thing that would get a premiere at the event.</p>


<p>It’s unclear who is behind the Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster as Capcom Vancouver,&nbsp; the team who made the Dead Rising games, was <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2018/09/19/dead-rising-developer-capcom-vancouver-to-close/">shut down in 2018</a>. “As a result of reviewing titles in development at Capcom Vancouver, Capcom has decided to cancel the development projects at this studio and will concentrate development of major titles in Japan,” the company said in a statement at the time.&nbsp; It did appear that Dead Rising 5 was in development at the time but it was cancelled, and that was the last we have heard of the franchise until today.</p>

<p>The last Dead Rising title was the fourth in the series and that was also released back in 2016.&nbsp; Sadly the PC version which we&nbsp; reviewed was littered with bugs and issues and we scored it just <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2016/12/15/dead-rising-4-review/">6/10 in our review.&nbsp;</a></p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dead-rising-deluxe-remaster-brings-a-classic-back-from-the-dead.911973/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dead-rising-deluxe-remaster-announced<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Capcom has announced another remaster of&nbsp;<em>Dead Rising</em>, and this one looks like it's bringing a full visual overhaul to the classic zombie-slaying sandbox game.</p>
<p><em>Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster&nbsp;</em>was revealed earlier today via teaser trailer, and while we don't get to see much of the new project, we can see that the visuals seem to have been significantly improved, with protagonist Frank West sporting a much more realistic (and still very recognizable) face.</p>
<p>The new trailer covers the intro to the original&nbsp;<em>Dead Rising</em>, wherein Frank West is helicoptered into Willamette, Colorado in order to investigate a zombie outbreak.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dead-rising-deluxe-remaster-frank-west.jpg?itok=ia5Mq6ub 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dead-rising-deluxe-remaster-frank-west.jpg?itok=1OQzV5HO 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Everyone's favorite insane photojournalist Frank West is coming back yet again.</figcaption></figure><p>Capcom describes the new version of&nbsp;<em>Dead Rising&nbsp;</em>as "an updated release with a brand new look" that's making its way to the current generation sometime in 2024.</p>
<p>I'm assuming that means PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S, along with a PC release, although it's unclear right now whether this new remaster will replace <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/427190/DEAD_RISING/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the existing one</a> on PC or be available as an additional version.</p>
<p>In any case, you can check out the brief announcement trailer for&nbsp;<em>Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster</em>, which is sporting a fun "DRDR" logo inspired by the original's graphic, right here.</p>

<p>The full extent of the changes Capcom will be making in this remaster aren't clear at the moment; it could just be a simple visual rework, or the studio could be taking this opportunity to sand down some of&nbsp;<em>Dead Rising</em>'s sharper 2006-era edges.</p>
<p>We'll just have to wait and see what's in store for this new version of Frank West's inaugural adventure, but at any rate, it'll be much more worth revisiting than <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/dead-rising-4-review-coal-miners-glove">2016's awful&nbsp;<em>Dead Rising 4</em></a>, which is probably why Capcom is going back to the start with this remaster.</p>
<p><em>Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster&nbsp;</em>will be available sometime in 2024, presumably for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S. Stay tuned for more.</p>

            <p>Boil the kettle, we're having cheap ramen. If you liked <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/townscaper">Townscaper</a> for simple seaside town tinkering, or enjoyed the forest-dwelling demo of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/tiny-glade">Tiny Glade</a>'s <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/i-made-the-witchy-cottage-of-my-dreams-in-tiny-glade">homely castle creation</a>, you might get a satisfied sigh out of this. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dystopika">Dystopika</a> is a cyberpunk build 'n' chill where you place down skyscrapers, apartment blocks, factories, and imposing ziggurats straight out of Blade Runner. There's no goal, no big number to hit or yammering town mayor to appease. Just some low tempo music, straightforward building controls, and the ability to insert your own cat pictures on the sci-fi billboards.</p>

<p>It's a "meditative city-sculpting experience"  according to designer, Matt Marshall, who made the game partly while travelling for a year across cities in Japan, Vietnam, Thailand, and Indonesia. "No goals, no management, just rich, atmospheric moods for contemplation, creativity and wonder," he says. What this means in real terms is that you're being given a toy for gardening a city skyline of the future. </p>
<p>The tools for building are sweet 'n' simple. You plop down buildings, choosing from among some themes. Perhaps you want those neo-pyramids of Omega Corp, or maybe the small blocks of lowtown. You click them into being, rotate them, resize them, and watch as a smattering of other tiny buildings appears magically around them. The automatic growth of a city happening in seconds. Very soon a handful of extra props are unlocked. For me, it all moves towards constructing a pleasing shot for the camera in the game's photo mode. Ah, there we are. Snap.</p>
<p>These no-frills builders evoke the feeling of dressing a set with pre-made props. You're preparing a scene, building up to that perfect frame, that pleasant feeling of satisfaction as you look over everything and think: yes, that's it. You don't have to think too hard about the fine detail of the props you're adding, it's all about composition, broad strokes. In Dystopika, you can get more into the nitty gritty as you go along, adding glowing advertisement billboards, neon lettering, holographic whales and (my personal favourite) little hovercar highways that criss-cross the city high above the smog-coated ground. But largely, it's like those other relax-o-builders, in that it invites you to stay loose and not worry too much. There's no wrong place to build a skyscraper. </p>

<p>When you feel ready, you can import images from your computer onto the huge billboards of the city, filling your neo-capital with the feline mascots such a metropolis deserves. So far I've only toyed with it for an hour, raising three distinct clusters of buildings at some distance from one another (in the cyberfiction of my own head, they are separate districts). New props, megastructures, camera modes, and mod features are planned for the future, says the creator in a road map on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2379910/Dystopika/?curator_clanid=44991926">the game's Steam page</a>. But I can safely say it has already given me my six quids worth of focused cyber-flow. Please excuse me, my glasses are steaming up. Must be all the noodling. </p>

So it’s an intriguing, if winking bit of casting that finds him in <em>The Exorcism</em>, about an actor whose addictions tanked his once high-flying career and who now finds himself starring in the apotheosis of schlock horror genres: an exorcism flick.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="193897" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="10 Creatures We Wanna Ride In Star Wars Jedi: Survivor" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="418" data-playlist="193897,194012,194316" data-current="193897"><div><p>10 Creatures We Wanna Ride In Star Wars Jedi: Survivor</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/193897/193897_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/193897/193897_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/193897/193897_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/193897/193897_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/19360.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>It could have been delicious to watch Crowe chew up a role like this—cheeky, scary, profane. It could have been a lot of things.</p><p>But the intensity just isn’t there in director Joshua John Miller’s debut film. The script, written by Miller and his partner M.A. Fortin, does an excellent job of paying homage to the great demonic possession films of yesteryear, even name-dropping a few of them as exposition. But the joke only goes so far.</p><p>Crowe plays struggling actor Anthony Miller, cast in a new horror film <em>The Georgetown Projects, </em>a pastiche of both <em>The Exorcist</em> and <em>The Amityville Horror, </em>after its lead dies on set under mysterious circumstances. Running at a paltry 93 minutes, it’s a horror film about the making of a horror film that never really gets cooking.</p><p>Miller’s past haunts him. His daughter Lee, portrayed by an excellent Ryan Simpkins, arrives just as he’s cast in the film and is witness to his spiritual and physical relapse. Simpkins brings a nascent groundedness to Lee, who is fresh off a suspension from her all-girls school for an act of protest that may have been an act of arson. They and Chloe Bailey, who portrays Miller’s young co-star Blake Halloway, both bring a glow and warmth to the screen whenever they appear together. It makes for a nice contrast with Crowe’s erratic and increasingly cold Miller.</p><p>Rounding out the cast are Sam Worthington, Adam Goldberg, and David Hyde Pierce. All three carry their roles dutifully. Goldberg makes the most of his few minutes on screen as an acid-tongued schlock-jock. Sam Worthington’s character could have used more time and development. At points, you forget about him entirely. Pierce eats up every line he delivers, taking a moment to savor the ridiculousness around him, though he still gives an earnestness and clarity of faith to his performance as Father Conor. He mugs his way through the third act—worth the price of admission alone if you decide halfway through that you should have seen a comedy.</p><p>The short run-time doesn’t allow for much more than exposition, with jump cuts and placards speeding you along. Russel Crowe does what he can to bring a gravitas to Miller, but the writing doesn’t support his effort. And it all feels a tad self-serious and cloying, like something you might buy from the Vatican gift shop. If you were a fan of his take on Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde in 2017’s <em>The Mummy</em>, then you’ll enjoy his performance here.</p><p>The possessed move at alarming speeds, spines bend the way they shouldn’t, and the demon king Moloch might be an executive producer on the film. All in all, <em>The Exorcism</em> is a fun but hollow take on a staple of the horror genre. Crowe deserves a hell of a lot better, but don’t we all?</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The game is all about surviving three days inside a zombie-infested mall while trying to figure out what’s going on. Or you can just sit on the roof and leave after three in-game days in one of <em>Dead Rising’s </em>multiple endings. A big selling point of the original <em>Dead Rising</em> was all the zombies on-screen, as well as the ability to use basically anything inside the mall as a weapon against the undead.

In the short teaser trailer, we see part of the game’s intro of Frank West—a photojournalist who has covered wars, y’know—flying into the zombie-infested town of Willamette via helicopter. </p><p>And well... while I think the town and helicopter look great in this new remaster, with improved lighting and nicer-looking textures, Frank himself is looking a bit odd. Here’s the original game’s intro for comparison: </p><p>In some shots in the teaser, he looks much older and looks almost like he’s wearing a Halloween mask of himself. I also am not sure about the new voice which sounds a bit too young and happy for our favorite zombie-slaying photog. </p><p>However, this is just one teaser and we’ll need to wait to see how the full game looks and plays. Hopefully, Capcom doesn’t make us wait too long to see some gameplay of <em>Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster</em>. </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
