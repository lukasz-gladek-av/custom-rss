			<p>There’s a real hustle and bustle to the historical 4X strategy genre right now, and Oxide Games’ Ara: History Untold is another strong contender for the crown that brings more fresh ideas and perspectives to a very familiar setting.</p>
<p><iframe title="Ara: History Untold Launch Trailer | gamescom Opening Night Live 2024" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1iF4gAZnZF4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Ara: History Untold tries to put a distinctive spin on how historical events and the rise and fall of various civilisations are depicted in this genre, and one thing I particularly like is how this affects the victory conditions. Everything that you do is in the name of accruing Prestige, and points are handed out for everything, from completing technological research to winning wars, holding onto alliances, simply producing a lot of goods, or pushing for cultural advancement and looking after your people through your governance.</p>


<p>You’ll still progress through historical technological eras in turn, but there’s also an overarching three-act structure as soon as multiple nations reach certain eras – and if you want, you can skip certain research groups in order to skip ahead an era. Each act transition also brings with it a winnowing of the field of competitors, the lower nations being consigned to the history books, their cities turning into ruins in the process.</p>
<p>It helps add some stakes earlier in the game, giving you a hurry up if you see that you’re falling behind after the first hundred turns, and potentially pushing you to min-max down a particular path to earn Prestige. Find yourself lagging behind in the Iron Age, and you might start throwing some armies around in the Antiquities, picking on some other lower-placed nations to scrabble your way back up.</p>


<p>One of the biggest and best ways to get ahead, though, is simply to look after your people and their quality of life. Each city has an individual measure of its citizens’ contentment across five categories, ensuring that you have to keep your city fairly well balanced in terms of what it provides. You’ll have to keep pace with providing a well for your people to give them fresh water, build inns and trading posts to help commerce come through your city and enrich them, add commodities to dwellings so there’s a degree of comfort, and provide certain structures like watchtowers and city walls to give a feeling of security. With all of these at least decently catered to, and keeping up with technological building upgrades, your city will grow naturally, your Prestige points growing alongside.</p>
<p>Ara: History Untold ditches the hexagonal tiles so common to the 4X genre in favour of more organic-looking regions, in the fashion of Total War’s campaign map. In addition to simply giving a baseline batch of resources each turn, each region is subdivided into multiple smaller plots where you can place your Improvements (buildings), each one giving the visual appearance of a city’s sprawl spreading across it, with higgledy-piggledy roads, buildings, and people meandering around, all visible as you select Improvements and the camera zooms in. As you butt up against rival nation borders, it will eventually lead to the world starting to look like a Neo Tokyo-like mega-city with every plot available occupied, but this general art direction and the way it’s presented is really lovely.</p>

<p>You have a similar effect when presented with a narrative decision moment, whether it’s interacting with a small tribe or a diplomatic message, the camera again pulling right into the world. More dramatic are battles, which let you view replays that feel ripped out of TABS as your units just mash into each other.</p>
<p>There’s a great deal of emphasis put on the resource gathering and production lines through your nation, and it just about tip toes along the thin line between complex depth and ease of use. Beyond basic food, materials, wood and gold, you have all manner of items that you will want and need to craft with production buildings. A farm will produce the grain that can head to a granary to craft grain store, or eventually to a mill that can create the flour needed for a bakery, which can produce baked goods that have a greater impact than raw food.</p>
<p>Workshops and their later evolutions are the real backbone to your production pipelines, able to craft all manner of fundamental tools and utility items – metal tools, wheels, rope and more – which are sometimes required for construction or which can be added to buildings to boost their overall output. A lot of goods are also able to pull double duty that can give a city-wide impact for a period of time, whether it’s feasts that boost happiness and growth, books that boost city knowledge, or wine to help them loosen up a bit.</p>

<p>Through all of this, there’s understandably quite a bit of micro-management, though there’s a good few views that put all of your buildings and production into perspective. It takes a while to figure out where everything is and what views work best for you, but you get the hang of things before the second age. Again, it does teeter on being overwhelming, but over time I feel it comes down on the right side of the scale.</p>
<p>I’m not sure that diplomacy is one of Ara: History Untold’s strongest suits. It’s perhaps a little too easy to just get along well with pretty much everyone, quickly fulfilling their requests, no matter how trivial they might sound, and getting a commensurate bump in perceptions. With no real effort of my own on standard difficulty, I was being bombarded with requests for trade, to share research and get a boost to research output, and eventually to form alliances.</p>
<p>Those alliances don’t seem to really be affected by wars, as you can happily ally while in the middle of a regional scuffle, and there’s no real ding to your reputation for being a bit of a scrapper (except for the nations you actually fight with, of course). Of course, being allied can see you dragged into a war, and that led to some really confounding results, admittedly somewhat obscured by sight range. One of the most baffling instances saw an AI-started war where an overwhelmingly strong alliance capitulated to a single, very surrounded nation, and cede both capital cities of my allies. It was difficult to really pin down what happened.</p>

<p>Battles feel similarly abrupt. They will generally unfold over multiple turns, giving you a chance to reinforce with a second army or send long-ranged fire from ships and artillery, but there’s little ceremony to them, outside of the optional battle replays. It would be nice to have an optional battle report pop up at the start of a turn to give you a run down, and foreground it beyond the resource management and jobs list. It would also be nice to be able to redeploy your armies in different configurations as you unlock new formations, and to be able to upgrade units to newer technology.</p>
<p>However, it’s fair to say that war is more of a necessary evil than a go-to tactic –&nbsp;even being able to declare war for anything more than mischief requires shared borders, retaliation, or certain government types. Much more emphasis is put on furthering your culture, crafting the goods you need, spreading your city borders, and constructing landmark wonders.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/baldurs-gate-3-modder-working-on-real-time-combat-mod/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Since the release of the official modding toolkit for Baldur's Gate 3, modders&nbsp;<span>have been pushing the boundaries of what they can create for the hit game made by Larian Studios. Not only do they have access to the official modding toolkit, but it didn't take people long to access the developer mode of the toolkit, which allows people to make&nbsp;new cutscenes,&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/baldurs-gate-3-modder-creates-custom-maps-including-avernus/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">new maps,</a></span>&nbsp;and much more.&nbsp;A Baldur's Gate 3 modder named tinybike has started creating a mod that implements real-time battles into the game instead of the turn-based combat that players are used to.</p>
<p><iframe title="Real time combat test (Baldur's Gate 3)" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nEBW4qIW28c?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The original Baldur's Gate games included real-time combat, which, if you think of how chaotic the combat in Baldur's Gate 3 can get, it seems like a recipe for chaotic disaster. At the moment, the mod is in very early, experimental stages. The mod doesn't have any sort of pause button yet, which could spell disaster if you're expecting to be able to take a toilet break in the middle of battle.</p>
<p>The modder tinybike has uploaded a video of the real-time combat test in Baldur's Gate 3 so that you see what kind of action you can expect by utilizing the mod whenever it comes out. The video only shows one person being involved in the combat, so it's uncertain whether the mod will allow players to utilize a full team for combat or not.</p>
<p>The modder has mentioned that this mod for Baldur's Gate 3 is still very much a rough draft, as they haven't yet added a pause ability so that you can give your party commands before the chaos ensues. It's set to resemble the combat system from the original Baldur's Gate games. They have also told people in the comments on their video not to try playing the campaign with the mod how it currently is. "I don't think it plays nice with dialogue yet (i.e. you will get butchered in real time while the dialogue is happening)," says tinybike in a comment on the video. They have also said that pausing should be pretty simple, as the mod means that the real-time combat is done "technically out-of-combat", so it should just be as easy as pressing the button to swap to turn-based mode.</p>
<p>The mod is available for <a href="https://github.com/tinybike/Brawl" target="_blank" rel="noopener">download at the moment</a>. You can also favorite it to keep up with its progress.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/frostpunk-2-profitable-sales-350k</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/frostpunk-2-is-already-profitable-as-sales-top-350k.988845/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/frostpunk-2-profitable-sales-350k<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Frostpunk 2&nbsp;</em>developer and publisher 11 bit studios has announced that the game has recouped its development and marketing costs, which means that after just a few days on sale, it's already profitable.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://x.com/frostpunkgame/status/1838181485859246232" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a message on X (formerly Twitter)</a>, 11 bit says that in the three days since&nbsp;<em>Frostpunk 2&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/frostpunk-2-delayed-september">was released</a>, the game has crossed 350,000 sales, which is pretty impressive for what is essentially a fairly niche title.</p>
<p>The studio goes on to say that the total estimated revenue from the sales&nbsp;<em>Frostpunk 2&nbsp;</em>has accrued so far "has already covered the costs we spent on producing and marketing the game", so everything that comes in from sales now is profit rather than cost recouping.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/frostpunk-2-profitable-sales-city.jpg?itok=UOnXfFpj 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/frostpunk-2-profitable-sales-city.jpg?itok=RkUvm_7e 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Your city in&nbsp;<em>Frostpunk 2&nbsp;</em>might be failing, but the game certainly isn't.</figcaption></figure><p>11 bit says that although it's touched by players' support for&nbsp;<em>Frostpunk 2</em>, "the work doesn't stop here". The studio says it's "continuously working on improving" the&nbsp;<em>Frostpunk 2&nbsp;</em>experience with hotfixes and updates, so development is still very much ongoing.</p>
<p>So, what does&nbsp;<em>Frostpunk 2</em>'s success mean for the game? Well, it's too early to call just yet, of course, but&nbsp;<em>Frostpunk 3&nbsp;</em>seems like it's probably on the cards now, if it wasn't already.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Additionally, given that 11 bit looks like it'll have some money left over from&nbsp;<em>Frostpunk 2</em>'s success, we might very well expect a major DLC expansion or two somewhere down the line, akin to the first game's&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/frostpunk-last-autumn-shows-us-days-before-winter">The Last Autumn</a>&nbsp;</em>or&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/frostpunk-reveals-on-edge-its-final-expansion"><em>On the Edge</em></a>.</p>

<p><em>Frostpunk 2&nbsp;</em>is, as you might expect, the sequel to the 2018 societal survival sim&nbsp;<em>Frostpunk</em>. It takes place 30 years after the first game and has you building a city amidst the advent of petroleum in a post-apocalyptic land blighted by permanent winter.</p>
<p>Just like in the first game, you'll be making very difficult moral and political choices as you navigate your newfound position as leader, but the sequel introduces factions , districts, and other new features that complicate matters.</p>
<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Frostpunk 2&nbsp;</em>right now on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S. If you want to know whether the sequel measures up to the original, then be sure to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/frostpunk-2-review-balance-resources-or-city-will-burn">take a look at our review</a>, and don't forget to read <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/features/frostpunk-2-director-lukasz-juszczyk-discusses-game-balance-politics-and-beta">our interview with the game's director</a> to get the lowdown on development too!</p>

Expect some classics, like <em>The Exorcist</em>, the OG <em>Halloween</em>, and <em>The Addams Family</em>, as well as some newer and cult-ier stuff like <em>Jennifer’s Body</em> and <em>Near Dark. </em>Whatever kind of mood you’re in, we’ve got a movie here for you—hell, there’s one for every day in October! You can start early if you want, or wait until the month kicks off and start getting through the list, the choice is yours. Click through for 31 movies to help you celebrate spooky season.</p></div></div><div><p>Before there was <em>Twilight</em>, there was <em>Near Dark</em>. The hard-to-find Kathryn Bigelow film (which only recently cropped up on YouTube, the last time I wanted to watch it I had to wait for it to be available on Criterion) tells the story of small-town farmer Caleb (Adrian Pasdar) who meets a beautiful drifter named Mae (Jenny Wright). The two flirt and fall in love that same night, but just before sunrise, she bites his neck and runs away, turning him into a vampire. Caleb is unwilling to feed, and Mae’s coven of vampires don’t like him one bit—they want him dead, and the most unhinged one in the bunch (played brilliantly by Bill Paxton) poses a threat to Caleb’s entire town.</p><p><em>Near Dark</em> is sexy and gory and intense, a neo-Western meets vampire flick meets Shakespearean romance. Though this is just her second film, Bigelow’s talent in establishing a vibrant, vibey atmosphere and pulling incredible performances out of her actors is apparent—this could be one of Paxton’s best roles, and I absolutely adore the crossover between this film and James Cameron’s <em>Aliens</em>. Cameron (Bigelow’s ex-husband) suggested she use his ensemble of actors from the 1986 film in <em>Near Dark</em>, and history was made—the terrifying trio of Paxton, Lance Henriksen, and Jenette Goldstein play off of each other brilliantly and act as a fine, furious foil to the star-crossed lovers.<br></p><p>By the end of <em>Near Dark</em>, you want nothing more than Caleb and Mae to walk out into the sun together, unscathed. They walked so Edward and Bella could run. — Alyssa Mercante</p></div><div><p>Isolation is one of the most horrifying things a person can experience, and <em>The Shining </em>expertly captures the psychic damage it can cause. Author Stephen King has raked the 1980 adaptation of his novel through the coals over the years, but the public has been much more receptive. Jack Nicholson and Shelley Duvall give career-defining performances that punctuate the Torrance family’s descent into madness, and <em>The Shining</em>’s fingerprints are all over pop culture, as its shocking imagery and absurdist line reads have embedded themselves as staples of the horror genre to be replicated and parodied decades later. Stephen King might not want you to remember the adaptation of his novel, but the film has since overshadowed the source material. — Kenneth Shepard</p></div><div><p>The original <em>Halloween</em> is the best movie to watch on Halloween. The slow, moody, and atmospheric horror film about Michael Myers returning to his town to kill again barely resembles the slashers and sequels that would follow in its footsteps. Its body count isn’t very high, it’s not super gory, and it doesn’t feature too many over-the-top moments. And yet, it’s still the best slasher ever made and the quintessential Halloween season flick.</p><p>It nails the feeling of Halloween night, even all these decades later. The slow build to Michael’s attack on the town and his intense confrontation with Laurie Strode is the perfect thing to have on in the background while handing out candy to trick-or-treaters. And then, as it gets later and quieter outside, you’ll be able to sit down and finish <em>Halloween</em> and you’ll almost believe that out there, somewhere, is Michael Myers. — Zack Zwiezen</p></div><div><p>Millennials, be honest: how many times have you watched <em>Hocus Pocus</em>? The 1993 film was basically permanently on the Disney Channel during spooky season when I was a kid, so I’d catch snippets of it when I was having my breakfast in the morning, when I got off the school bus in the afternoon, and after a soccer tournament over the weekend. As such, much of this film has been burned into my brain, from Sarah Jessica Parker’s hilarious take on an airhead witch to the adorable Max Dennison (played by Omri Katz) and the entirety of the musical number. </p><p>This is a classic spooky season movie—it’s campy and colorful and set during Halloween (there’s even a costume party). Bette Middler is absolutely brilliant as the head witch, and the child actors expertly hold their own against Hollywood royalty. <em>Hocus Pocus</em> is one of those films you throw on when you’re feeling a bit sick and need a soothing pick-me-up. It will forever remain one of the best spooky season movies of all time. — Alyssa Mercante</p></div><div><p>When I first saw Ari Aster’s feature-length directorial debut, I thought about it for days. <em>Hereditary</em> is the violent, demonic endgame of what happens when no one ever sorts out their generational trauma. The Graham family are picked off one by one by a chain of events set in motion by their grandmother who was long gone by the opening of the film. <em>Hereditary </em>is known for the grotesque, no-punches-pulled violence to which it subjects its family of four, but the worst of its violence are the acts of psychological torture they deal to one another. Whether it’s a son’s carelessness, a mother’s resentment, or a father’s inaction, the underlying horror of <em>Hereditary </em>isn’t in watching a family be torn apart by outside forces, it’s seeing it be desecrated from the inside with only the slightest push. — Kenneth Shepard</p></div><div><p>Full disclosure, I’m the adult child of an alcoholic, which definitely gave this film a particularly resonant power with me, but you don’t need to bring that baggage to the film for its humanity and horror to grip you. I also haven’t read the novel <em>Doctor Sleep </em>yet, but nonetheless, the film left me astounded by how Stephen King, decades after centering the destructive effects of alcoholism on family patriarch Jack Torrance in <em>The Shining</em>, turns compassionately to his son Danny, now grown and struggling (and, in Mike Flanagan’s wonderful film, played brilliantly by Ewan McGregor). There’s just so much wisdom here, about growth, about forgiveness and healing, about how finding a way to be kind and offer something to others can be what makes life meaningful. </p><p>Oh, and it’s also fun as hell, a story about a classic battle of good and evil, with the evil side represented by a group of soul vampires led by Rebecca Ferguson, and the good side helmed by Abra Stone (Kyleigh Curran), a young Black girl with psychic powers. If you can, watch the Director’s Cut. It makes a good film even better. — Carolyn Petit</p></div><div><p>Jordan Peele’s most recent film makes horror <em>grand</em>. It blows the typically intimate genre into a sweeping flick all about spectacles and the virtues we forsake in our pursuit of them. Like <em>Signs</em>, one of its inspirations, <em>Nope </em>conveys much of its horror through sound and brief glimpses, even suggestions, of the capabilities of its main threat, an alien that OJ and Em (Daniel Kaluuya and Keke Palmer, respectively) dub Jean Jacket, before a rousing showdown near the film’s end. </p><p><em>Nope </em>is as heady as Peele’s socially conscious brand of horror has ever been, and it’s also just as inventive. Jean Jacket is a horror film villain (if you can even call it that) like I’ve never seen, and the most refreshing take on an alien in my lifetime at least. Its forms and motivations defy our preconceived notions of the alien, all while maintaining the very real danger of a confrontation with the unknown. In the words of OJ, it’s a “bad miracle,” and god am I glad that <em>Nope </em>came out of that. — Moises Taveras</p></div><div><p>Perhaps the quintessential witch movie, 1996’s cult classic <em>The Craft</em> is an absolute must-watch during spooky season (and required viewing if you want to be in my friend group). It has all the hallmarks of a great ‘90s film: the trials and tribulations of high school, the horrors teenage boys inflict, and the joy of finding a group of fellow outcasts to bond with—except there’s witchcraft. Think <em>Heathers</em> but on Halloween.<br></p><p>Fairuza Balk gives a legendary, infinitely quotable performance as Nancy Downs, the punk-rocker-turned-conjurer who gets drunk off her newfound power, while Robin Tunney plays the preppy protagonist with an effortlessness that makes me wonder why she didn’t get more leading roles. <em>The Craft</em> may not be <em>technically</em> accurate in terms of how it portrays witchcraft (maybe don’t bring this film up at your local occult store) but it’s my favorite witch movie of all time and the perfect thing to queue up with a glass of pumpkin beer in your hands. Don’t forget the cinnamon sugar rim. — Alyssa Mercante</p></div><div><p> The <em>Saw </em>movies get a bad rap from people who consider them to be “torture porn.” By the time the series concluded its first run with 2010’s <em>Saw 3D</em>, it had truly fallen into the trappings of that descriptor, exchanging its philosophical debate about the value of life to instead treat characters as playthings to be put through a meat grinder  as grossed-out audiences watched through their fingers. </p><p>But I’d argue that <em>Saw </em>is not torture porn, and not even really a “horror” franchise in the traditional sense. Instead, I view it as a death game, complete with players, high stakes, and a philosophical struggle driving the whole thing. John “Jigsaw” Kramer is still one of the most fascinating villains in the horror genre. As a man with delusions of grandeur fueled by his own mortality, his fundamental views are so flawed that half the fun of the series’ elaborate timeline is watching him clash with everyone he comes into contact with. Yes, <em>Saw </em>is violent, often needlessly so considering some of the people Kramer puts into his death games, but watching its central villain paint social and moral commentary with the blood of his victims never gets old. — Kenneth Shepard</p></div><div><p>In the <em>The Witch,</em> a goat named Black Phillip asks its main character, a young Puritan woman whose family has been cast out of their village and who is blamed for her youngest sibling’s disappearance: “Wouldst thou like to live deliciously?” Yes, you read that right, and after watching writer and director Robert Eggers’ debut film and seeing how alluring witchcraft and devilish deviance would be for a woman living in such patriarchal and oppressive times, you understand the allure of such a question. From the moment the film opens, it’s clear you’re in for a somber, moody experience—but as soon as things start to go south, you can feel fear creep up your body like a cold, dank chill in a log cabin. </p><p>Along with exploring the cultural mindset of early Puritanical settlers, <em>The Witch</em> shows off Eggers’ obsession with historical accuracy—the structures on set were built by thatchers and carpenters well-versed in building in 17th century British-American style, and Eggers spent years researching language to ensure the script was written accurately. It’s a beautiful, haunting movie that put superstar Anya Taylor-Joy on the map.<br></p><p>Watching <em>The Witch</em> is like stepping into a time machine and out into an unknown, virtually uninhabited 1630s New England. With an unknown evil lurking in the woods and puritanical men telling you how to behave, wouldn’t you decide to live deliciously, too? — Alyssa Mercante</p></div><div><p>Dan Stevens is a national treasure. Not ours, but I still love him. After charming our pants off in <em>Downton Abbey,</em> he played against type as an unnerving Afghanistan war veteran who arrives back stateside in a small town to wrap up  some unfinished business in 2014's <em>The Guest</em>. I haven’t seen anything else its director, Adam Wingard, or its writer, Simon Barrett, have made, but <em>The Guest</em> has become an almost annual Halloween watch for me. It’s incredibly low-stakes but also very unsettling, mixing some ‘80s B-horror movie vibes with the stomach-churning dread of all those post-9/11 war crimes stalking your conscience just off screen.</p><p>Stevens perfectly sells his performance as the war buddy of a family’s dead army son that teaches them to live, laugh, and love. Think <em>Black Mirror</em> meets <em>Napoleon Dynamite </em>with a stiff-upper lip Brit at the center of it. I showed it to my parents and they hated it, so it has that going for it too. — Ethan Gach</p></div><div><p>I think <em>It </em>surprised the hell out of all of us in 2017. After years of drab remakes of classic films, here was one that had some bite to match its bark. <em>It</em>, from director Andy Muschietti, successfully turns Pennywise the Clown (Bill Skarsgård) from a possible gag into a living nightmare, all the while adapting things that work from Stephen King’s acclaimed novel and, let’s just say, <em>streamlining </em>elements that always felt really out of place. </p><p>The cast of young losers are a marvel, especially Bev and Bill (Sophia Lillis and Jaeden Martell, respectively), but the movie really does belong to Pennywise, whose tendrils can be found puppeteering the evil machinations and tendencies of the town of Derry. Pennywise toys with the kids in increasingly absurd and horrific encounters that never lose sight of what a frankly silly villain a clown makes, while revealing that there’s obviously more to him than the clown greasepaint and his big-ass head. If you’ll forgive my use of the phrase, it’s a modern classic, through and through. — Moises Taveras</p></div><div><p>Hands-down this is Megan Fox’s best performance, not to mention an absolutely iconic film. Written and directed by Diablo Cody, <em>Jennifer’s Body</em> is a tongue-in-cheek flick about a popular high school girl who is sacrificed to the devil so a pop punk band can find fame—except she comes back to life as a man-eating demon. From the moment the movie begins, you know it’s going to be full of zingers and hilarious moments—there’s a 9/11 joke, more than one period gag, some bisexual barbs, and a jump-scare cameo by a young, scummy Chris Pratt. Fox is sarcastic and savage as the popular Jennifer Check, while Amanda Seyfried plays her hapless, hokey friend Needy with wide-eyed wonder that she, brilliantly, turns on its head near the end of the movie.<br></p><p>With a banger soundtrack (that includes Panic! At The Disco, Florence + The Machine, and Dashboard Confessional), gnarly gore, biting humor that could only come from the aughts, and a dark, sensual sexiness, <em>Jennifer’s Body</em> is an all-time classic. — Alyssa Mercante</p></div><div><p>David Robert Mitchell’s <em>It Follows </em>just works on so many levels. First, there’s the core concept of a relentless force pursuing you, somewhere out there, that can take the form of just about any person you can imagine, that will kill you if it catches up with you, and that you can only throw off the scent by having sex, in which case the person you sleep with becomes the target. It’s the kind of chilling notion that gets inside your head, haunting you long after you leave the theater, and it can serve as a metaphor for so many things. </p><p>Then there’s the virtuosic filmmaking, which makes the absolute most of this concept. Not only does protagonist Jay (Maika Moore) scour every environment she’s in, looking for anyone who stands out and could be the relentless pursuer, but so do we as viewers. The film takes devilish pleasure in showing us crowds, knowing that our eyes will scan everyone—all the people cluelessly just going about the business of their lives—wondering if, soon, it will become clear that one of them is the film’s Terminator, getting dangerously close to Jay. </p><p>And finally, there’s the way that <em>It Follows</em>, not content to be just a horror film about modern-day young people, engages in some subtle but terrific worldbuilding that makes its setting feel both recognizable and ever-so-slightly off.  For instance, early in the film we see a teen using what looks at first like a clamshell-style makeup compact, but when she opens it, it’s actually some kind of high-tech e-reader. This is just the first of many (no-doubt deliberate) <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://thoughtcatalog.com/m-j-pack/2015/08/heres-why-you-missed-the-scariest-part-of-it-follows/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://thoughtcatalog.com/m-j-pack/2015/08/heres-why-you-missed-the-scariest-part-of-it-follows/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">strange details and anachronisms</a></span> that make the setting of <em>It Follows </em>as memorable and strange as the chilling concept at its core. — Carolyn Petit</p></div><div><p>We can play favorites all we want, but the truth is that the first <em>Scream </em>is the best one. I doubt one will ever come along that’ll outdo it, even if I find the escalating lunacy and campiness of its <em>several</em> sequels enthralling in its own right. What other franchise is constantly mocking itself while providing scares <em>and </em>commentary on the genre and the movie business? <br></p><p>The first <em>Scream </em>is the gift that keeps on giving. The opening with Drew Barrymore is timeless, not least of all for being the genesis of the line, “What’s your favorite scary movie?” <em>Scream</em> gave us the best final girl ever in Neve Campbell’s Sidney Prescott. It gave us the incredible homoerotic sexual tension between Billy Loomis (Skeet Ulrich) and Stu Macher (Matthew Lillard). It gave us freakin’ Ghostface, the most iconic slasher villain since Jason Voorhees, Jamie Kennedy as a horror film aficionado trying to predict and get ahead of the slaughter that descends upon the town of Woodsboro, and one of the most mesmerizing finales of a horror flick ever. It’s got gore, humor, and a star-studded cast. <em>Scream </em>will simply always be one of the best horror films you can possibly watch now or ever. — Moises Taveras</p></div><div><p><em>Barbarian</em> is one of those movies that you should go into absolutely blind (if the internet will allow it) to ensure you get to experience maximum madness. I remember seeing this movie in theaters—how I simultaneously laughed and gasped in disbelief at certain moments, how my heart rate refused to drop long after the credits rolled, and how I couldn’t stop talking about it to anyone who’d listen for days after seeing it.<br></p><p>In <em>Barbarian</em>, a young woman named Tess (Georgina Campbell) arrives at a Detroit rental house that is already occupied by an incredibly handsome guy named Keith (Bill Skarsgård). The neighborhood is a bit sketchy, and though she’s initially wary, Tess warms up to Keith and decides to sleep in the bedroom while he takes the couch—it seems like the two may even have a *vibe* going on, so there’s hope that this messed-up situation could turn into something great. Except, of course, it doesn’t. The entire situation descends into full-blown horror, as the two discover the house’s hidden secrets, the horrors that have taken place there, and the monsters that lurk within.<br></p><p>Though <em>Barbarian</em> includes plenty of the kind of cruel violence you’d expect from a horror film, there’s also the pleasure of seeing Justin Long appear as a slimy, skeezy actor who gets exactly what he deserves, and it is glorious. — Alyssa Mercante</p></div><div><p>“Because you were home.” These words, chillingly delivered by one of <em>The Strangers</em>’ anonymous assailants at the very end of the movie, have never failed to make my spine tingle. <em>The Strangers </em>is no gore fest, nor is it a rampage. It’s got arguably one of the lowest kill counts of similar horror movies, and yet it is one of the most terrifying things in the world. </p><p>What if death and violence just comes for us indiscriminately one night? What if it creeps into our home and snuffs us out just because? What if there’s no significance to these life-or-death matters beyond being in the wrong place at the wrong time and in the sights of the wrong people? That’s the paranoia that <em>The Strangers </em>taps into as you slowly watch a trio of masked strangers terrorize a couple, creepily linger in the background of scenes, and finally shed blood just for the hell of it. If you want to be scared off from ever living in the suburbs, or are a millennial or Gen Z kid who’s never going to own one anyway and wants to feel alright about it, watch <em>The Strangers. </em>— Moises Taveras</p></div><div><p>Almost undoubtedly the best horror comedy romance movie ever made, <em>Shaun of the Dead </em>is a spectacular crowdpleaser, and an ideal horror movie for people who don’t like (or who think they don’t like) horror movies. It’s not that it skimps on the scares, it just wraps them up in such delightful, hilarious, infectiously enjoyable circumstances that even most scaredy-cats will be laughing along, enjoying the ride, and discovering that horror can be wonderfully fun. — Carolyn Petit</p></div><div><p><em>The Ritual</em> may be my favorite full-blown horror film, thanks in large part to the eeriness of its setting (a Swedish forest) and its folk-horror roots—few things scare me more than ancient evil, and this movie is full of that shit. <em>The Ritual</em> begins with four friends whose relationship is strained (to say the least) embarking on a hiking trip together in an effort to heal after they experienced an incredibly traumatic event. Horror loves trauma dumping, and boy does it just get worse from there.<br></p><p>Shortly after the foursome steps into the dense woods, one of them gets hurt (surprise) and they decide to cut through the forest to ostensibly get him help faster. A torrential downpour forces them to take shelter in a creepy old cabin, but when the men wake up in various states of panic and pain, it’s clear that there’s something wrong with these woods. Things only get crazier from there as they realize they’re not only lost, but being pursued by <em>something</em>. The acting is top-tier, the movie <em>looks</em> beautiful, and its perfectly balances the pace throughout its 94-minute run-time. <em>The Ritual</em> has it all: confronting traditional notions of masculinity, people impaled on trees, a cult worshiping an offspring of Loki, and, of course, a lot of moments that will make you scream. — Alyssa Mercante</p></div><div><p>I like my horror to be a little more ambient than the balls-to-the-wall bloodshed and gore sort we often get. There’s a time and place for that kind of stuff, but I’m much more into movies that creep at the same pace as <em>Lake Mungo</em>, a film shot as a fake documentary about the death of a girl named Alice and the ways in which her family deals with her loss. </p><p>There isn’t much in the way of thrills in <em>Lake Mungo</em>, but the action of the movie gets increasingly unsettling as the family begins to spiral and believe that Alice is haunting them. It doesn’t go full <em>Paranormal Activity</em>, but the family does start recording their home in the hope of finding some proof that she is still with them, and what comes of these explorations is sufficiently lo-fi and eerie. If the rising tension of the movie keeps you around long enough, stick through its credits to be totally weirded out and gain a newfound uncomfortable feeling in the pit of your stomach. — Moises Taveras</p></div><div><p><em>The Descent</em> was the first horror movie I ever saw in theaters, on a first date with a guy who would eventually become my high school sweetheart. So, I bizarrely have fond memories of a rather horrifying film for that very reason—because let me be clear, <em>The Descent</em> is <em>intense</em>. It follows a group of women who go on a spelunking expedition after one of them suffers a tragedy, just for more tragedy to ensue because this is, after all, a horror movie.<br></p><p>Not long after their descent (teehee) into the convoluted cave system (an unexplored one, which the woman who led them there conveniently leaves out), a collapse blocks their exit. They forge onward, finding signs that  other expeditions have made their way through this place seeking an exit. But there’s something else: horrible, Gollum-like predators that feast on human flesh. <em>The Descent</em> is a gory 100 minutes of heart-pumping jump scares and horrors, and is definitely one of the scarier films on this list. — Alyssa Mercante</p></div><div><p>I’ve watched a lot of horror flicks over the years, but <em>Fire Walk With Me </em>is one of the few that I think really captures the essence of evil. A far cry from the weird and offbeat TV show that preceded it, <em>Fire Walk With Me </em>recounts the last living days of Laura Palmer, a tortured American teenage girl if there ever was one. <strong>It is not a movie for the faint of heart, and you should consider this a warning for the lengthy list of troubling subjects and material in this movie</strong>. If you do manage to brave this thoroughly unsettling movie, preferably after at least watching <em>Twin Peaks</em>, you’ll find a deeply sorrowful and empathetic tale that is more than just a bizarre blend of surrealism, off-kilter quirkiness, and homegrown horror.</p><p>If the goal of <em>Twin Peaks </em>was to slowly and eerily subvert the cutesy image of suburban domesticity, <em>Fire Walk With Me </em>is the ringing and piercing final shot into the dark heart underneath all that artifice, or at least it was until the show was eventually revived 25 years after its conclusion. In that light, <em>Fire Walk With Me </em>is also the agonizing and confounding blueprint for <em>Twin Peaks</em>’ eventual return, which borrowed heavily from the sensibilities of the film rather than the show’s original run, making it the most essential viewing to understand the entire arc of the series. Again, <em>Fire Walk With Me </em>can be a rough watch, but I think it’s one well worth the time and hardship. — Moises Taveras</p></div><div><p>Spooky season isn’t just about getting scared, it’s about embracing your campy side—something the Addams family understands better than most. Though the earlier 1991 film was the first to introduce us to this incredible cast (which includes young Christina Ricci, the hilarious Christopher Lloyd, and, as Gomez and Morticia Addams, the brilliant and beautiful Anjelica Huston and the late, great Raul Julia), this sequel is far better. </p><p>Not only is the title a tongue-in-cheek reference to the Republican obsession with conservative family values, but there’s a trio of ridiculously funny plots that weave together well, and an absolutely crackerjack performance from Joan Cusack. It’s a must-watch that will have a smile permanently plastered on your face. — Alyssa Mercante</p></div><div><p><em>Pulse</em>—the 2001 Japanese original rather than the American remake—is another film that is low on thrills and jump scares but is dripping with dread. A horror parable for the internet generation, <em>Pulse </em>tells two parallel ghost stories at the turn of the century which hone in on themes of loneliness and connection. It’s one of the slowest burns ever, but it’s a sufficiently creepy and profound ride to the very end. As people begin to disappear around Japan, the film turns from one about metaphoric isolation to the actual thing, and seeing the city streets slowly empty out over the course of the movie feels like watching the apocalypse quietly claim us all.<br></p><p><em>Pulse </em>is unnerving as all hell, and nowhere is that truer than in its most iconic scene. In it, the character Yabe (Masatoshi Matsuo) crosses a threshold he clearly shouldn’t and meets with a ghost in a poorly lit and clearly abandoned passage. The striking silhouette of the apparition emerges from a shadow towards Yabe, at which point he recoils, but the ghost doesn’t attack him. Instead, it menacingly just walks towards him, performs an unusual movement that briefly reveals its visage, and then reverts back to its stalk. The score and physical performance here are so unnatural that despite the lack of any real surprise, the scene’s action feels uncompromisingly urgent, and <em>Pulse </em>carries that to unease to its very final moments. — Moises Taveras</p></div><div><p>I won’t tell you anything about <em>The Exorcist</em>, in part because you probably already know its key story beats (and probably a few of its classic lines), but also because the story I will tell you will sell it for you. </p><p>My high school soccer coach was quite the orator, and every year when it got close to Halloween he would tell us scary stories at the end of practice, in a corner of the pitch where the field lights didn’t reach. One year, he told us about the night he had gone to see <em>The Exorcist</em> when he was a kid, and walked home alone in the dark, absolutely petrified the entire way. When he finally arrived home, his father was waiting in the bushes for him, and jumped out just as he reached the front door. My coach screamed and did a near-perfect back flip off of the front porch, to which his dad replied, “Wow, guess it was a scary movie, huh?” — Alyssa Mercante<br></p></div><div><p><em>Signs </em>is well-remembered these days for a particular scene. I know it, you know it, everybody knows it. It’s the birthday party that traumatized everyone, and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/shittymoviedetails/comments/1blsxvc/in_signs_2002_joaquin_phoenix_shouts_in_spanish/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/shittymoviedetails/comments/1blsxvc/in_signs_2002_joaquin_phoenix_shouts_in_spanish/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">conjured a baffling bit of Spanish from Joaquin Phoenix</a></span>. But surrounding that moment, <em>Signs </em>does a whole lot with very little, a trick director M. Night Shyamalan’s would hone, misuse, and then sharpen again across the next two decades. </p><p>The aliens that are constantly terrorizing the cast are heard more than they’re seen. You can tell they’re around by the shuffling of grass, the crop circles burnt into fields, and in one scene, by the sound of crickets chirping. When they are seen, they’re often obfuscated by darkness or some other scene element. They maintain an air of mystery and danger, even as <em>Signs </em>gets to its climactic showdown, because Shyamalan waits until he absolutely <em>must</em> show the alien threats to ever put them on screen. Even if the movie isn’t all that terrifying, the director still puts on a clinic, showing how to economically and tastefully build up suspense, making it a must-watch for lovers of the form. — Moises Taveras</p></div><div><p>I remember some choice aspects of <em>28 Days Later</em>, otherwise known as the film that put zombies back on the map. Here are the two that stand out the most: Grandaddy’s “A.M 180” and the aesthetics of its apocalypse.<br></p><p>First, “A.M 180.” The synth-driven song seems vintage, like the sounds of an old arcade machine being played back through a warped or damaged recorder. Considering how it plays over a scene of the movie’s leading band of survivors pillaging an undisturbed supermarket after the collapse of society in a zombie outbreak, its deliberately nostalgic sound and lyrics pining for better days and company are well deployed.<br></p><p>Second, the movie’s style. <em>28 Days Later </em>is widely heralded as the work that revitalized the zombie genre, which had become stale by the time of its release in 2002. Its plot was mostly character driven, and the aesthetics of its apocalypse were a bit more disheveled and grimy rather than rapturous and surreptitious. The band of militaristic and chauvinist villains revealed toward the end reflected a sentiment that’d only grow through the years: a deep distrust of the patriarchal institutions our society has propped up over eons. </p><p>Oh, and I guess this movie popularized zombies that could run. These are tenets that would go on to be found in tons of horror and horror-adjacent zombie media, such as the 2004 remake of <em>Dawn of the Dead </em>that heavily borrowed from <em>28 Days Later</em>, and even <em>The Last of Us</em>. It’s one of the most influential pieces of horror since the turn of the century, and you’ve likely engaged with something that owes its existence to <em>28 Days Later</em>, so it’s probably worth a watch. — Moises Taveras</p></div><div><p>Jordan Peele’s debut horror film, you will always be famous. From the brilliant casting of <em>Girls</em>’ Allison Williams as the fake-ass girlfriend to the incredibly uncomfortable white liberalism woven throughout, <em>Get Out</em> will make your skin crawl. Daniel Kaluuya is brilliant in the lead role, and the random punctuations of genuinely hilarious moments offer a reprieve from all the racism. White people, watch it with your parents. — Alyssa Mercante</p></div><div><p>I’ve watched a lot of movies throughout my life, meaning it’s hard to keep the plots of them all straight in my head. I know that <em>Sinister </em>is a movie about a writer discovering several snuff tapes, but I don’t remember a lot of the events around it all that much. I don’t really need to, though, because <em>Sinister</em>’s eeriest moments have been burned into my brain since my very first viewing. </p><p><em>Sinister</em>’s most spine-tingling stuff are the snuff tapes that Ethan Hawke’s character watches over the course of the film. Each begins and ends in much the same way: an unseen figure seemingly records a family from a distance. In the videos, they are often enjoying time together, either in their living rooms or maybe by the pool. Nonetheless, the fact that they’re being observed prompts a sense of dread that is only made worse by the sudden shifts in the home video. Without fail, the happy scene of domesticity gives way to a murder. The kills aren’t gory or flashy, and in fact the camcorder sometimes seems like it’s struggling to make sense of the action, but the sound editing in these moments, as well as the unnerving and choppy footage, never fail to make me shudder. — Moises Taveras</p></div><div><p><em>Evil Dead 2 </em>is far from the scariest movie on this list, but it damn sure is the funniest. Horror and comedy have a deep and intertwined history, and <em>Evil Dead 2 </em>is one of the shining beacons of that legacy. Essentially a remake <em>and </em>sequel to the original movie, it once again features Bruce Campbell in the role of Ash Williams, who takes a romantic trip to a cabin in the woods that gets disturbed by the forces of hell and evil trees. A bigger, better, more ridiculous, yet somehow more sensible movie, <em>Evil Dead 2 </em>skews more toward hilarity than outright scares, resulting in some big laughs while keeping things suitably weird. You ever blast a hole in the wall of a clearly haunted house, only for it to spew fountains of blood and then visibly mock and laugh at you? Well, Ash does in <em>Evil Dead 2</em>, and it’s as horrifying as it is hilarious. — Moises Taveras</p></div><div><p><em>Under the Skin </em>is an entirely different kind of horror movie, in that it really isn’t even trying to play to the genre all that much. Many folks would probably argue with my classification of the movie, and that’s fine. Nonetheless, it <em>is</em> eerie as hell watching Scarlet Johansson drive a van around as a detached alien observing the human condition, pick up men around town, and subsume them into a nebulous void. The nothingness of this liminal and distinctly alien place is only exacerbated by the impeccable and sparse set design and score of the scenes that take place there. <em>Under the Skin </em>feels like a miracle: a quietly hostile feat of filmmaking that just needs to be seen to be absorbed and understood, and it’s a testament to the skill of director Jonathan Glazer that it came out as fully formed, bewitching, and confident as it is. — Moises Taveras</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Despite the massive financial success of Nintendo’s Wii, the console’s games (outside of the central first-party titles) have always had a somewhat negative reputation. While it’s true that there was a lot of awful shovelware and games ruined by shoehorned waggle controls, there were also standout games that were overlooked by the wider gaming community. Perhaps chief among these was Epic Mickey, a surprisingly dark and interesting take on Disney’s most iconic character. Indeed, looking back most of the interest in the game came from the involvement of industry legend Warren Spector (of Deus Ex fame). The eventual sequel, Epic Mickey 2: The Power of Two, moved away from exclusivity and released on all contemporary platforms with added coop multiplayer and a shift towards being an interactive musical. But, going back to the original, Epic Mickey has now been remastered – or Rebrushed as the title has it – in the hope of finding a wider audience.</p>
<p><iframe title="Disney Epic Mickey: Rebrushed - Deep Dive Trailer | PS5 &amp; PS4 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/aeSqXnhlBio?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Put simply, the story of Epic Mickey stems from Mickey Mouse being a pretty terrible character. He breaks into mentor Yen Sid’s office and interferes with his magical paint, bringing devastation to the world of Wasteland in the process. Wasteland is where all the forgotten cartoon characters go and for Mickey to compound his role in eclipsing the likes of Oswald the Lucky Rabbit shows what a villain he truly is. However, given his iconic role as the face of Disney, he is cast here as the hero and it’s up to you to fix what he has done and restore the world of the Wasteland. Wider allegories to the role of Disney as a corporation could easily be made here but that is perhaps outside the remit of this review, and a game about a mouse with a paintbrush.</p>



<p>Graphically Epic Mickey was always a striking game, but one whose 3D sections were held back by the limitations of the Wii hardware. The interspersed 2D sections were highlights back in 2010 and remain so now, but the quality of the presentation as a whole has improved almost beyond recognition. The fantastic art design of the world of Wasteland really gets a chance to shine here and it is a good example of a game that really needed a visual update.</p>

<p>Audio has, somewhat disappointingly, been kept very faithful so the various cutscenes still lack voice acting with characters employing grunts and chirps. Given the extended use of voices in the sequel this feels like a shame.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, the game mixes two different platforming styles. The majority of the game plays out in 3D as you traverse environments both original and inspired by Disney classics. Travelling between the different 3D spaces occurs through jumping into projector screens that take you to levels closely based on original Mickey Mouse shorts such as Steamboat Willie. These are beautifully animated and strongly reminiscent of the Illusion titles from the 16-bit era. Both styles control well, but I would have liked to see longer 2D sections and even perhaps a boss fight or two in this style.</p>

<p>Mickey comes equipped with traditional traversal mechanics, such as a double jump and spin but newly added to this version are evasive dashes and ground pounds. These have been widely publicised in the promotion for the game but the new mechanics are almost entirely unnecessary as the actual game has not been changed to require their use. I never used either throughout my entire playthrough as the game is still mostly based around the magic paintbrush that Mickey wields. You can use this brush to either add paint or remove it with thinner, and there are many areas where either approach is valid. Enemies can either be befriended with paint or destroyed with thinner whilst navigating the world requires you to remove barriers or repair platforms and moving machinery.</p>
<p>When the game is at its best it requires you to use both platforming skills and environmental puzzle solving to work through complex areas and the different brush skills provide a simple moral level as well. Do you repair and befriend or take the quicker and more destructive route? Every boss can be defeated by either approach with the game playing out differently either way. This provides the advertised multiple endings but in truth it works out as a binary choice between paint and thinner, with the main reward being an upgrade to whichever you use. The boss fights themselves play out more as separate puzzle areas rather than combat per se but are enjoyable. However, much of the game still feels quite repetitive and padded out, issues I always had with the original.</p>

		<p>Summary</p><p>
		Epic Mickey Rebrushed is the ultimate version of the game and the team at Purple Lamp have clearly put a lot of love into updating the game for a contemporary audience. That being said, the additions to Mickey’s moveset are completely unnecessary and the core game remains largely the same. If you’ve played Epic Mickey before then this version will bring back any nostalgia you have for the game and if you haven’t then it is a good way to experience a neglected title. The lack of anything more than a cosmetic upgrade does make the high price a little hard to justify but this is still a solid game for anyone with a fondness for the Mouse.	</p></div>

						<h5>Disney's Epic Mickey: Rebrushed</h5><p><span>September 23rd, 2024</span>
					</p></div><div>
							<h5>Platform</h5><p><span>PC (Steam, GOG), PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S, Xbox One</span>
						</p></div></div></div>
					<p>From its <a href="https://wccftech.com/epic-mickey-rebrushed-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announcement</a>, Dysney's Epic Mickey felt unlike any other game starring Mickey Mouse. Instead of the usual colorful platform game, the game developed by Junction Point Studios, a development team founded by the creator of the Deus Ex series Warren Spector, was a darker game that was part of a much wider project to reintroduce Mickey's more adventurous side to a bigger audience.</p>
<p>Featuring a very interesting setting that granted players the chance to delve into the more obscure Disney productions and characters, as well as some sort of morality system, the game promised to be a new beginning for Disney in the video gaming space. Unfortunately, Disney's Epic Mickey proved to be nothing more than a rather run-of-the-mill platform game marred by plenty of issues that were only barely salvaged by the setting and some interesting mechanics that weren't exactly fully developed, like the aforementioned morality system.</p>
<p>14 years later, THQ Nordic decided to give the game a second chance. Developed by Purple Lamp, Disney's Epic Mickey: Rebrushed aims to improve the original experience by addressing a variety of issues and expanding it a bit with a slew of new content. Unfortunately, the improvements, while welcome, fail to address some of the game's core issues, which have only become more aggravating in the years since the original release.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/20240909182808_1.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Disney's Epic Mickey: Rebrushed's story is the same as the original, and it's still one of the highlights of the experience. The game is set in the Wasteland, a world for forgotten things, namely Disney's forgotten or underused characters, created by the sorcerer Yen Sid that gets heavily messed up by the clumsy intervention of Mickey Mouse. Due to the damage he causes, the Wasteland becomes a post-apocalyptic world tormented by the monstrous Blot. Decades after the incident, Mickey Mouse is abducted by an ink monster and brought to the Wasteland, where he makes the acquaintance of many different characters, including Oswald the Rabbit, Walt Disney's very first character, in the attempt to save the Wasteland and return home.</p>
<p>While the story isn't anything special by itself, it's the Wasteland and the twisted recreation of some iconic Disney locations that make Disney's Epic Mickey: Rebrushed a very interesting experience. The vast majority of locations Mickey explores in the game are based on popular Disney locations such as Sleeping Beauty Castle, Main Street, U.S.A., Toontown, and many others.</p>
<p>In these locations, Mickey will also meet tons of forgotten or underused characters, such as Horace Horsecollar and Clarabelle Cow, rarely used variants of popular characters like Pete, and even animatronic versions of Donald Duck, Goofy, and Daisy Duck. All this is incredibly interesting for both hardcore Disney fans and those with only a passing knowledge of classic cartoons, and they manage to make the experience interesting from beginning to end, even with a mid-story and gameplay.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, Disney's Epic Mickey: Rebrushed has plenty of gameplay enhancements over the original Wii release, not counting some forced tweaks due to the lack of Wiimote controls. Mickey's movement and core abilities have been improved, and he can now sprint, perform a dash maneuver, and ground pound attack, which makes exploring the Wasteland slightly better than before. The Guardian Meter system was improved, giving players a better idea of the Guardians that will join Mickey depending on their combat choices. Collectibles have also been increased, and select locations have been expanded with new areas, secrets, and puzzles.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/20240909194945_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>All these additions make Disney's Epic Mickey: Rebrushed a little more fun to play, but they don't address what made the original game an average 3D platform game to begin with. For starters, level design is not that interesting, featuring gimmicks that already felt a little dated back in 2010. Mickey's Magical Brush, which grants players better interaction with the environment, allowing them to restore or destroy certain elements to access secret areas or solve puzzles, is a great idea on paper but isn't used to its full potential, mostly due to the unexciting level design. The project-screen 2D stages, which can be replayed at will in the remaster, are just as average as the 3D stages, featuring dated gameplay concepts and gimmicks. It's not that they are terribly bad per se; it's just that they feel uninspired. Making matters worse is the extreme linearity of the experience, which is a far cry from other modern 3D platform games such as Super Mario Odyssey.</p>
<p>Combat is also pretty straightforward and not particularly engaging. While the vast majority of enemies roaming the Wasteland can be destroyed easily using any of Mickey's attacks or the Magical Brush's Thinner, using Paint grants him the chance to win them over to his side. This is just one aspect of the morality system featured in the game. Depending on choices made in combat against regular enemies, two types of Guardians can join Mickey, allowing him to activate the Thinner and Paint effects of the Magical Brush in a single hit. Depending on how the player approaches boss battles, different power-ups will be handed out as a reward once the battle is won.</p>
<p>The morality system also comes into play during exploration. For example, Mickey will sometimes come across a special machine that can only contain either Thinner or Paint and depending on his choice, there will be different effects and consequences. Certain quests can also be completed in several different ways, and depending on the choices made, it is possible to skip mini-boss battles. Unfortunately, there are no far-reaching consequences for the player's choices, as they are relegated to the area where they are made most of the time. The only exception to this is the ending, which is influenced by how much Thinner or Paint is used during the course of the game. Seeing all endings shouldn't take too long for most players, as a single playthrough with a decent chunk of optional content is around 10 hours long.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/20240909193339_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>The visual upgrade featured in Disney's Epic Mickey: Rebrushed is undoubtedly well-realized and one of the best features of the remaster. Every game asset was remade from the ground up, and it shows. The visuals look crisp, with great character models and textures that succeed in portraying the Wasteland and its somewhat oppressive atmosphere. The original 2D cutscenes were also re-rendered in 4K resolution, making them look better than they ever did in the original.</p>
<p>Despite being an undemanding game, Disney's Epic Mickey: Rebrushed doesn't exactly run smoothly, even on a high-end system, which was sadly expected, being powered by Unreal Engine 4. During a benchmarking session held in the Mount Osmore Slopes area, the game ran at native 4K resolution, max settings, at a whopping average of 407 FPS on my system (i7-13700F, RTX 4080, 32 GB RAM). The 1% low 94 FPS, however, makes it clear how there was some stuttering during gameplay. It was nothing major, to be honest, but still very noticeable. Those with systems not as powerful as mine should still be able to run the game reasonably well with the help of the Intel XeSS upscaler, which is strangely the only upscaler the game supports at launch.</p>
<p>As a remaster, Disney's Epic Mickey: Rebrushed effectively addresses some of the original game’s gameplay issues while adding new content and improved visuals. However, some of the core issues of the original were left untouched, keeping this version from being a significant upgrade. While exploring Disney’s forgotten history is still enjoyable, the game’s platforming mechanics continue not to don't stand out, especially against today’s competition like Super Mario Odyssey and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/astro-bot-celebrated-platformer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Astro Bot</a>.</p>

<p>Disney's Epic Mickey: Rebrushed is a solid remaster that enhances the original experience with some nice improvements. Unfortunately, the experience is still carried by the setting exploring Disney's forgotten history, as the remaster does little to address dated level design, lackluster combat, and underdeveloped features like the morality system. Despite these shortcomings, Mickey's journey in the Wasteland remains enjoyable, especially for hardcore Disney fans eager to see some of the company’s long-forgotten characters brought back to life.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/epic-mickey-rebrushed-review-we-need-more-mischevious-mickeys<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I missed the majority of the Wii's lifecycle when it first came around. While I returned to a lot of the larger Wii titles over time,&nbsp;<em>Epic Mickey</em> was one that was always on my periphery as a <em>Kingdom Hearts</em> and Disney fan, but never played. With <em>Epic Mickey Rebrushed</em> releasing, I was excited to jump in and see whether I had cheated myself out of an 'Epic' adventure, or if Mickey's big Wii outing was a bit thin.</p>
<h2>Mickey Used To Be A Rascal</h2>
<p><em>Epic Mickey</em> begins with the premise of Yen Sid creating a world for all of the Disney characters of yesteryear, the different variations of characters used in one-off appearances or even the characters that completely disappeared like Horace Horsecollar. Mickey, having found his way through a portal in his mirror, runs amok, spilling a bottle of paint thinner that becomes The Blot into the world, cursing it to fall to ruin.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/epic-mickey-rebrushed-story-mischevious-mouse.jpg?itok=llxXlVyk 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/epic-mickey-rebrushed-story-mischevious-mouse.jpg?itok=tI9JHFWQ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Mickey is at the finding out part of... well, you know.</figcaption></figure><p>Years later, Mickey is discovered as the culprit and, along with a magic paintbrush, is pulled into the Wasteland. Trying to make his way out, Mickey befriends and assists the people of the Wasteland.</p>
<p>One of the first touches I really enjoyed about the story of <em>Epic Mickey</em> is that it's Mickey back to his mischievous roots. He's not the paragon of positivity that we know now on the mast of the Disney corporation but a mouse looking to create some trouble thinking he knows best.</p>
<p>Within the world of the Wasteland, that attitude is unfortunately immediately tempered as he begins to take on the tasks of different characters, but it is also somewhat molded by the ever so slight morality system of being able to use thinner to create a darker world or paint to bring life back to it. The way you conclude major boss fights or alter different areas of the game come down to how you use your tools. Unfortunately, it never felt like <em>Epic Mickey Rebrushed </em>took the mechanic as far as it could have, leaving us with surface-level changes.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/epic-mickey-rebrushed-boss-fight-clock-tower.jpg?itok=FYnDaqZS 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/epic-mickey-rebrushed-boss-fight-clock-tower.jpg?itok=GRZEN6iH 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Thin the boss to get more thinner capacity and destroy it, or paint the boss to increase your paint and make the world a bit better (at least on paper).</figcaption></figure><h2>Hybrid Platforming In <em>Epic Mickey</em></h2>
<p>The gameplay in <em>Epic Mickey</em> is a mix of 3D platforming and 2D platforming, with just enough third-person shooting allowed to aim and fire paint and thinner at the world. Mickey is required to explore the world in an effort to find a way to escape. This journey takes him through a number of areas modeled as darker reflections of the kinds of locations you'd expect to find at a Disneyland theme park.</p>
<p>You first arrive at the Dark Beauty Castle (Cinderella's Castle), before progressing through Mean Street (Main Street), Tomorrow City (Tomorrow Land), and so on, and you even get to see different takes on rides like the Pirates of the Wasteland or Great Big Tomorrow (the Carousel of Progress).</p>
<p>These references to real-world locations do a good job of creating a number of visually unique and enjoyable locations, while also winking at the Disney fan enjoying the game that there's another reference for them to enjoy.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/epic-mickey-rebrushed-mean-street.jpg?itok=97WJ6Nty 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/epic-mickey-rebrushed-mean-street.jpg?itok=XJcqj_Y7 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Mean Street is an immediately recognizable parallel.</figcaption></figure><p>Platforming is smooth if not a bit floaty. Mickey tends to hang in the air and then drift down slower than you might expect; it makes for easier platforming, especially for a younger age demographic, but it also makes the game feel a lot slower than it should be. A benefit of this floaty jump is how it can be used to get around the map very easily. I found myself routinely sequence breaking while exploring off the beaten path only to have to return to the start of an area so as to not miss major plot points.</p>
<h2>Paint or Thin to Alter the World</h2>
<p>While in the land of 3D, you'll also see a variety of 'toon' elements that you can either fill in with Paint or remove from existence with Thinner. This allows a lot of the world to be extremely interactive. You could paint a platform or building in to reach new heights, or thin something out and reveal an underground bunker with a collectible inside.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/epic-mickey-rebrushed-pirates-of-the-carribean-platforming.jpg?itok=kaxPBkNb 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/epic-mickey-rebrushed-pirates-of-the-carribean-platforming.jpg?itok=Qv-BYsLg 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Look out for silhouettes or differently colored objects to know what can be painted or thinned.</figcaption></figure><p>This element is most interestingly used when it comes to the larger boss fights of <em>Epic Mickey Rebrushed</em>. Every boss you face will have a way to defeat them or a way to befriend them depending on whether you use Thinner or Paint respectively. Each opportunity can be quite different; against a robotic Captain Hook, using thinner might result in his destruction while you can use paint to platform up The Jolly Roger to release Peter Pan's sprite.</p>
<p>In between moments of 3D platforming, Mickey travels between hub spaces using projectors themed of different classic Mickey Mouse cartoons. In these 2D platforming spaces Mickey can do everything he normally can, except use Paint/Thinner. A lot of the same floatiness in the platforming is present, but it's a nice way to take what is already a reference-filled video game and pack it even further with references to the past.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/epic-mickey-rebrushed-side-scrolling-platforming.jpg?itok=Pq1lp7EA 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/epic-mickey-rebrushed-side-scrolling-platforming.jpg?itok=XEMkqE8W 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>2D platform through Mickey's history? This is almost an homage to <em>Mickey Mania.</em></figcaption></figure><h2><em>Epic Mickey Rebrushed </em>Review | Final Thoughts</h2>
<p><em>Epic Mickey Rebrushed</em> does a good job of melding together pretty good but not great platforming for younger Disney fans who want to see Mickey's latest (reimagined) hijinks, as well as for the old guard who remember some of the obscure characters behind references.</p>
<p>While it is still a shame that elements like voice acting were never implemented it still delivers a fun and complete platforming challenge.</p>

<p><em>Mea Culpa&nbsp;</em>will bring new zones, new bosses, and a brand new alternative ending to&nbsp;<em>Blasphemous 2</em>, and it's launching, appropriately enough, on October 31st. Hopefully, you'll be able to find enough time to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dragon-age-veilguard-release-date-leaked-trailer">put down&nbsp;</a><em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dragon-age-veilguard-release-date-leaked-trailer">Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a>&nbsp;</em>to check it out.</p>
<p>In total, you can look forward to two new zones and two new bosses in&nbsp;<em>Mea Culpa</em>, as well as four new NPC quests. A new weapon (presumably the Mea Culpa of the title, which was the Penitent One's sword in the first game) will also be added in the DLC.</p>

<p>The True Torment Update brings a number of improvements to&nbsp;<em>Blasphemous 2</em>, including a New Game Plus mode, a "host of upgrades for the Penitent One", and a ton of quality-of-life improvements.</p>
<p>You can also expect expansions to the Choir of Thorns, Sunken Cathedral, and Basilica of Ancient Faces zones, which The Game Kitchen says will add "new challenges to explore and conquer".</p>
<p>New connections between zones have also been added to facilitate faster travel, and the Labyrinth of Tides has a new challenge for you to take on. The update will also bring new enemies across the whole of&nbsp;<em>Blasphemous 2</em>'s world.</p>


<p>If you're unfamiliar with&nbsp;<em>Blasphemous 2</em>, it's the sequel to 2019's Metroidvania&nbsp;<em>Blasphemous</em>. Like its predecessor, the sequel is heavily themed around religion, with much of the game's terminology, as well as many of its enemies and aesthetics, strongly evoking Christian concepts and themes.</p>

She’s just, understandably, fed up of it.<br></p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197260" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Agatha All Along Star Sasheer Zamata On Witchcraft And Star Trek" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="348" data-playlist="197260,197209,196923" data-current="197260"><div><p>Agatha All Along Star Sasheer Zamata On Witchcraft And Star Trek</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197260/197260_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197260/197260_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197260/197260_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197260/197260_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/22805.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>“I’m not going to be recording gameplays any more,” says Curry, after a deep breath, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNGH8o3LDBo&amp;t=36s&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNGH8o3LDBo&amp;t=36s" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">in a new vlog</a></span> posted to her channel. “It seems that I spend most of my time, sitting in here at this computer, and lately—probably for the last month—I walk in here and look at my computer and think, ‘I’ve <em>got</em> to make a video today.’ And then I just shake my head at myself, and say, ‘I don’t want to. I have no desire to.’”</p><p>It’s a sad video, perhaps because of the <em>lack</em> of regret in Curry’s voice as she expresses her weariness with the process. She begins the video explaining that she is having eye surgery the next day, and is obviously quite concerned about it, before moving on to say of recording <em>Skyrim</em>, “I’m old, and I’m tired, and I don’t feel like doing much any more.”</p><p>“I’m just doing it for fun,” she explains, after laughing over how her son keeps pointing out she doesn’t “<em>have</em>” to record any videos. “And it’s not fun any more. I’m tired of it. I’m bored <em>to death</em> with it.”</p><p>It’s really quite the emphatic end. Grandma Shirley has previously taken breaks over the last decade, but normally only for a few days or a week. Back in 2020, she stepped away for a while due to—with wearying inevitability—<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/skyrim-grandma-is-taking-a-break-because-of-internet-as-1843663799&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/skyrim-grandma-is-taking-a-break-because-of-internet-as-1843663799">constant unpleasantness in her comments</a></span>. Curry has also taken issue with the way her videos somehow only score viewing numbers in the four figures, despite her enormous subscription, inevitably due to the grim YouTube algorithms that will crush thumbnails of an elderly lady or in-game footage, preferring some gurning buffoon with gaped mouth next to the words, “WORST FAIL EVER!” or what have you.</p><p>In the past, Shirley has received <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/shirley-the-skyrim-grandma-has-her-own-fully-voiced-mod-1846852430&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/shirley-the-skyrim-grandma-has-her-own-fully-voiced-mod-1846852430">a fully-voiced mod that adds her to <em>Skyrim</em> as a companion character</a></span>, and she’s supposed to be an NPC in <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/elder-scrolls-vi-6-tes6-update-release-date-bethesda-1851363646?_gl=1*1s9jmfb*_ga*MzQzNjkwNDM2LjE2NDY2NjQ1NzQ.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTcyNzA5MzIzNi4xNjkuMS4xNzI3MDkzNDA4LjQxLjAuMA..&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/elder-scrolls-vi-6-tes6-update-release-date-bethesda-1851363646?_gl=1*1s9jmfb*_ga*MzQzNjkwNDM2LjE2NDY2NjQ1NzQ.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTcyNzA5MzIzNi4xNjkuMS4xNzI3MDkzNDA4LjQxLjAuMA..">the  forthcoming <em>Elder Scrolls VI</em></a></span>.

But live she has. Let’s hope Shirley is still around and healthy to play it whenever it does release, free of the burden of having to make videos about it.</p><p>Thankfully, there’s an epic archive of all the lovely videos she has made, with their wonderfully contrary mix of top-notch gaming chair and defiantly 4:3 aspect ratio (despite Curry playing on an ultra-widescreen monitor). She also promises to continue to upload vlogs as and when she feels the need.</p><p>Grandma Shirley, we wish you all the best with the surgery, and implore you to feel no guilt for stepping down—you’ve created a wealth of wonderful videos that will live on forever, and we thank you for it.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/resident-evil-3-classic-gets-gog-re-release-this-week.988767/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/resident-evil-3-classic-gog-re-release<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>GOG has announced that a re-released version of classic survival horror game&nbsp;<em>Resident Evil 3: Nemesis&nbsp;</em>will be available on the platform in just a couple of days.</p>
<p>Launching on September 25th - that's in just two days at time of writing -&nbsp;<em>Resident Evil 3&nbsp;</em>will arrive on GOG pretty much fully intact, albeit with a few modern improvements like an improved DirectX renderer and sharper visuals.</p>
<p>Given that the original&nbsp;<em>Resident Evil&nbsp;</em>was added to GOG's library back in June, and that the sequel <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/original-resident-evil-2-gog-release-date">got itself a re-release in August</a>, it's nice to see the third game arriving and tying up the original 90s&nbsp;<em>Resident Evil&nbsp;</em>trilogy.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/resident-evil-3-nemesis-gog-re-release-spiders.jpg?itok=ScRmRlxr 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/resident-evil-3-nemesis-gog-re-release-spiders.jpg?itok=Z6--8gBo 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>With apologies to arachnophobes.</figcaption></figure><p>As GOG itself says, this re-released version of&nbsp;<em>Resident Evil 3&nbsp;</em>is practically identical to the original; it'll be presented in all its pre-rendered glory, with the same (admittedly upscaled) blocky character models and enemies you may remember if you played it way back in the late 90s.</p>
<p>Of course, if you've only played <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/resident-evil-3-remake-rising-april-2020">the 2020 remake</a>, then like its predecessors, this version of&nbsp;<em>Resident Evil 3&nbsp;</em>might seem a little dated to you. If you're in the mood for some classic tank-control survival horror, though, this one's a real gem.</p>
<p><em>Resident Evil 3&nbsp;</em>was originally released back in 1999. Its plot revolves around Jill Valentine, who returns from the original&nbsp;<em>Resident Evil</em>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Jill must flee a Raccoon City overrun with the undead, as well as other creatures that have been mutated thanks to the machinations of the Umbrella Corporation. In particular, she must face off against Nemesis, a hulking brute that appears sporadically throughout&nbsp;<em>Resident Evil 3</em>'s story.</p>

<p>Nemesis himself is a pretty interesting and innovative enemy, especially given the time in which&nbsp;<em>Resident Evil 3&nbsp;</em>was released. He'll periodically pursue you depending on where you're up to in the story, and he can't be killed, so you'll have to find a way to temporarily incapacitate him or escape from him.</p>
<p>You'll be able to grab&nbsp;<em>Resident Evil 3&nbsp;</em>on PC <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/resident_evil_3" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">via GOG</a> on September 25th. The <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/resident_evil" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">first</a> two <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/resident_evil_2" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">games</a> are already available on the platform, and you can also pick up <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/resident_evil_bundle" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">a bundle that includes all three</a> if you like.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/black-myth-wukong-patch-balancing-bug-fixes/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/black-myth-wukong%E2%80%99s-latest-patch-brings-balancing-changes-and-bug-fixes.988764/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/black-myth-wukong-patch-balancing-bug-fixes/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Black Myth: Wukong has just received patch 1.0.9.15179, which features some balancing adjustments and fixes for bugs and crashes.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Black Myth Wukong’s patch 1.0.9.15179 is 1.7GB, but players must reserve around 92GB of free disk space to update “due to the platform’s update mechanism”. Additionally, the patch may cause compatibility issues with some of the mods you have installed, so it is advisable to uninstall the mods and verify the integrity of the game before restarting.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-black-myth-wukong-balancing-adjustments-and-other-changes">Black Myth: Wukong Balancing Adjustments and Other Changes</h2>



<p>Regarding balancing, the first changes players will observe in this Black Myth Wukong Patch are towards the combat experience for the Yaoguai King “Hundred-Eyed Daoist Master.” Additionally, the issue of the Destined One being pushed out of the invisible walls during specific Yaoguai Chief and King battles has been fixed.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Moreover, the Spikeshaft Staff will now increase your maximum mana by 30, and the Insect armour will considerably increase the effects of all medicine effects. The Black Myth Wukong patch will also reduce the narrowing effect of the timing window for Rock Solid Deflection imposed by the Great Safe Talent “Sound as A Bell (Fuming Ears).”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Furthermore, the Destined One can purchase the “Fine Gold Thread” material from Yin Tiger after Entering a New Cycle.&nbsp;</p>

</p></figure>



<h2 id="h-bug-fixes">Bug Fixes</h2>



<p>Firstly, the occasional crashing during particular boss fights for Windows systems if the Windows system language was set to Turkish on the PC version has been fixed, along with other crashes and errors. An issue preventing 100% completion from triggering has also been fixed.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Black Myth Wukong patch brings fixes to enemy issues for times when they get stuck or become unbeatable in certain situations or under specific conditions. Also, there were issues with the menu interface affecting enemy skills; murals at the Great Pagoda weren’t displayed correctly, and character models in Flaming Mountains weren’t removed properly. All these issues have been fixed; you can check out all the other fixes in Black Myth Wukong patch 1.0.9.15179 <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2358720/view/4675388674375798112" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">here</a>.&nbsp;</p>

All the usual suspects were in the top 10 most-played games on Valve’s platform, including Counter-Strike 2, Dota 2, Banana (yes, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-banana-game-may-not-be-a-scam-but-its-still-not-worth-your-time">Banana has yet to split</a>), and PUBG, with this year’s Black Myth: Wukong, Satisfactory 1.0, Space Marine 2, and Valve’s own Deadlock putting in work. Last week saw PlayStation exclusives God of War Ragnarok and Final Fantasy 16 both launch on Steam for the first time, which will have provided a modest boost, too.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>The Best PC Games</h3></div></output><p>The popularity of Steam is gradually increasing as Valve’s vice-like grip on the PC market tightens ever further. Competitors such as the Epic Games Store and CD Projekt’s GOG occupy a relatively small piece of the PC gaming pie, with Steam continuing to enjoy record-breaking success even amid perceived downturns in the video game industry. The release of Steam Deck is yet another platform on which Steam operates.</p><p>The question now is, can Steam hit that 40 million concurrents figure? It seems inevitable — indeed the release of <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-6">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</a> next month may help Steam hit that milestone.</p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

<p>In <a href="https://x.com/ConcernedApe/status/1837953798289199323" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a message on X (formerly Twitter)</a>, Barone confirms that Update 1.6 will arrive on all of the consoles on which&nbsp;<em>Stardew Valley&nbsp;</em>is currently available (and <a href="https://x.com/ConcernedApe/status/1837957646168830258" rel="noopener" target="_blank">yes, that includes the Switch</a>), as well as iOS and Android devices, on November 4th.</p>
<p>Barone also confirms that the update will include the 1.6.9 revision, which adds a bunch of new stuff like work portraits for Sam and Shane at JojaMart, as well as bringing balance changes and bug fixes.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/23/24251736/nintendo-mmwave-device-24ghz-fcc-filing<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nintendo has submitted a <a href="https://apps.fcc.gov/oetcf/eas/reports/ViewExhibitReport.cfm?mode=Exhibits&amp;RequestTimeout=500&amp;calledFromFrame=Y&amp;application_id=m9V0HXBXo8nolsDsEYU3Nw%3D%3D&amp;fcc_id=BKECLO001">mysterious new wireless device</a> to the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) this weekend, and it isn’t the Switch 2 console we’re expecting to be revealed before next April. The CLO-001 model number doesn’t reveal what it <em>actually</em> is, but it appears to be an entirely new product line given the “001” codes used on devices like the original Switch (HAC-001) and DS (NTR-001) consoles.</p><p>It’s tagged only as a “wireless device,” not a “wireless game console” or any kind of controller like a Joy-Con. A basic diagram within the documents shows an outline of where the FCC label will be “displayed in a depression area on the bottom” of something with a squarish footprint and rounded-off corners. </p><p>The documents also show that there’s no body-worn accessory involved with the testing and that it doesn’t have a battery and can only operate plugged in — it was connected to the same USB-C charger that Nintendo ships with its Switch consoles in tests, but that only reveals it can be powered by USB-C.</p><p>The CLO-001 is surprisingly light on wireless technology — there’s no 5GHz or 6GHz Wi-Fi radio and no Bluetooth, but it does sport a 2.4GHz Wi-Fi radio and a 24GHz mmWave sensor.&nbsp;</p><p>The 24GHz mmWave sensor is the most interesting detail we have. It could be a radar sensor to track movement, like closely following gestures or detecting when someone is nearby the device, causing it to turn on automatically like we’ve seen in the 60GHz sensors found in devices like the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/10/15/20908083/google-pixel-4-project-soli-radar-motion-sense-explainer">Pixel 4</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/12/12/23998677/aqara-presence-sensor-fp2-track-your-sleep">Aqara’s smart home presence sensor</a>.</p><p>The Wi-Fi hardware in the first-gen Switch was created by Cypress Semiconductor, a company that was acquired <a href="https://www.infineon.com/cms/en/about-infineon/press/press-releases/2020/INFXX202004-049.html">a few years ago</a> by Infineon, which is now promoting the capabilities of its 24GHz radar sensors. 24GHz radar can provide a detection range of up to 100m, with penetration possible through obstacles, at the tradeoff of a larger size and lower resolution, according to Infineon. We couldn’t tell which hardware is inside this device, but the Infineon <a href="https://www.infineon.com/cms/en/product/sensor/radar-sensors/radar-sensors-for-iot/">website includes comparisons to 60GHz sensors</a>.</p><div><p>So then... what is it? Guesses include a new gesture control interface, an upgraded dock for some kind of device at <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22339582/super-nintendo-world-review-theme-park-japan">Super Nintendo World theme parks</a>, or maybe even a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/2/4/10920582/nintendo-sleep-tracker-qol-possibly-canceled">return of the “Quality of Life” sleep tracking initiative</a> Nintendo attempted a decade ago. It could also be something to support AR features by detecting real-world objects — meaning it could be used for <a href="https://www.theverge.com/21514758/mario-kart-live-home-circuit-review-nintendo-switch">new <em>Mario Kart Live</em> hardware</a> or even a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/7/11/12148964/pokemon-go-game-app-nintendo-niantic"><em>Pokémon Go</em>-like system</a>.</p></div><p>It really is anyone’s guess right now given the limited information available. But it’s rumor season with the Switch 2 coming, so let us know if you have any better ideas!</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Last week, fromsoftserve shared a few videos showcasing improved anti-aliasing and distant models. The modder also shared a 4 hours long video showcasing some late-game locations, which we advise you not to watch if you have never played the game and don't want to be spoiled. Needless to say, the video does an excellent job showcasing how much emulation has been improving in the past few weeks.</p>

<p>While it is definitely too early to say if there won't be any emulation issues, it looks like even a low-end, dated system may be able to run Bloodborne reasonably well via the ShadPS4 emulator in the future. A new video shared by BrutalSam showcases the game running via the emulator's 0.2.1 WIP version on a system featuring an old Intel i5-4440 CPU and a GTX 960 GPU with only 2 GB of VRAM. Performance is far from being optimal due to stuttering issues, but it's still very impressive for the emulator to run on such a dated system configuration.</p>

            <p>Valve are likely up to something hardware-related again, report <a href="https://www.notebookcheck.net/Valve-is-testing-ARM64-support-for-popular-games-sparking-speculations-about-new-future-hardware.891851.0.html">NotebookCheck</a>. Their next chunk of plastic and wires – following the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/valve-index-review">Valve Index</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-steam-deck-games">Steam Deck</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/steam-deck-oled-review">Steam Deck OLED</a> – could swap PC gaming’s favoured x86 architecture for ARM, the type of processor favoured by the Nintendo Switch, Macs, and mobile phones.</p>
<!--more-->
<p><a href="https://steamdb.info/app/3043620/history/?changeid=25321568">SteamDB</a> reveals a piece of software named 'ValveTestApp3043620' that's associated with dozens of PC games, ranging from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/left-4-dead-2">Left 4 Dead 2</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/garrys-mod">Garry’s Mod</a> to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/among-us">Among Us</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hollow-knight">Hollow Knight</a>, which in turn have tags like 'proton-arm64ec' and 'proton-arm64ec-experimental'. To "Occam’s Razor" an explanation for this, the mysterious app suggests that Valve are testing out a version of Proton (the compatibility layer that makes Windows games run on the Linux-based SteamOS) that could work on ARM64 processors.</p>
<p>The most boring outcome of this would be something like Valve just releasing SteamOS for MacBooks, Apple’s M series of mega-fast laptop and desktop chips being arguably the most famous examples of ARM architecture in action. Just as likely, though, is Valve assessing ARM as the basis of their next big hardware release, having stuck with x86 for the Steam Deck family.</p>

</figure>
<p>I don’t think the possibility of new Steam-branded kit is the story here – since the first <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/topics/steam-machine">Steam Machines</a>, Valve have been in the hardware game for over a decade, and have given no indications of packing it in. But the potential switch to ARM could bring some fresh possibilities, if also some risks.</p>
<p>For one thing, ARM chips are typically more power-efficient than their closest x86 counterparts, so could be very suitable as the basis for a new Steam Deck or wireless VR headset. ARM’s compatibility with the Android operating system might also make it a lot easier to add your favourite mobile games to your PC library; outside of emulation, this is only possible on x86 hardware in very narrow, limited ways.</p>
<p>However, the big challenge – for Valve and for Proton – would be maintaining performance and compatibility. While modern ARM chips are no less powerful than x86 ones, the fact that most PC games are built exclusively for the latter could pose problems in keeping framerates up. This isn’t so much of an issue when Proton is tricking Windows games into running on SteamOS, as both platforms were built with x86 in mind, but enabling those games on the completely different ARM64 architecture would presumably involve something more like full emulation. Which, generally, slows down performance.</p>
<p>Still, Proton’s whole job is to headbutt compatibility barriers into matchsticks, so who knows. And regarding the hardware itself, I’m not convinced it’s going to be an ARM-powered Steam Deck, partly because <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-steam-deck-oled-is-here-but-valve-say-not-to-expect-a-true-next-gen-steam-deck-for-a-long-time">Valve told me last November</a> that a next-gen Deck is likely years away. A standalone VR headset is a decent bet, though given ARM has muscled its way into Mac Pros, its efficiency benefits don’t necessary mean portable use only. A new generation of Steam Machines, perchance? Watch this space.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2’s developers already have ideas for a DLC or sequel.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In an interview with <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/success-of-warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-changes-everything-dev-says-and-yes-there-are-ideas-for-space-marine-3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">IGN</a>, Saber Interactive’s Chief Creative Officer, Tim Willits, spoke about their plans for a DLC or sequel. Willits stated that Space Marine 2’s game director has already “proposed some story ideas that could either be DLC or a sequel”.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While the dev team is currently taking a breather, they are committed to providing long-term support for Space Marine 2. Willits has confidently assured that they will not let down the Warhammer fans and are hopeful to be working on Space Marine content for a considerable time.&nbsp;</p>



<p>While speaking about DLC content for Space Marine 2, Willits stated that one major reason for having 25 million players in World War Z was releasing new content such as DLC packs, free classes, and more. He added that whenever they released such content, the team would observe a spike in sales as well as player count.&nbsp;</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Willits also expressed his excitement about the future of Space Marine 2, stating that its success has changed their approach to everything. He shared, “This changes everything we do moving forward, from our small games like our third-party publishing games to A Quiet Place next month. We have Toxic Command coming up with Focus soon. Everything that we do now, this changes.”</p>

It sold an eye-watering 18 million copies in just two weeks across PC and PlayStation 5, making over $700 million in revenue so far. That’s enough to put Black Myth: Wukong up there with Grand Theft Auto 5 and Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 as one of the fastest-selling games of all time, and is an astonishing return for a game that had a reported budget of $70 million over six years of development.</p><p>IGN has otherwise reported on <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/in-black-myth-wukong-you-can-summon-one-boss-to-beat-another-boss-while-basically-doing-nothing"><u>a super cool Black Myth: Wukong secret that lets you summon one boss to beat another boss while you basically do nothing</u></a>, and on how <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/one-very-early-black-myth-wukong-boss-is-absolutely-destroying-players"><u>one optional boss encountered very early in the game was absolutely destroying new players</u></a>.

			<p>There are unusual names in gaming. Some evocative, some mysterious, and some that leave you with eternal questions about what the game is actually about. Caravan SandWitch manages the feat of being all three. That sense of mystery lies at the heart of Plane Toast’s laidback sci-fi adventure, as you explore the crumbling remains of a distant, insignificant planet, far from anywhere important.</p>
<p><iframe title="CARAVAN SANDWITCH - Gameplay trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/s2TAX3kwBiM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Caravan SandWitch asks many questions in its relatively short runtime. Questions about loyalty and loss, about tenacity and tribulation, and about knowing when to let go. It’s surprising just how thoughtful it is, and how often the remaining inhabitants of this planet will tug at your heartstrings.</p>


<p>You’re Sauge. Called back to your home planet Cigalo by your sister Garance’s distress signal. The thing is, Garance has been missing for years, and the mixture of hope and hopelessness that this distress signal causes is well played out. After hopping on a space train home – soundtracked by some gorgeous French vocals courtesy of composer Antynomy – you find that Cigalo is on the decline, with few families remaining in the remnants of your homestead.</p>


<p>You’re given use of a gloriously chunky yellow caravan, and it’s in this that you set out to explore the surface of Cigalo. There’s the remains of various industrial sites strewn across the landscape, and you have the time to thoroughly explore each of them, discovering new pieces of tech, or simply marvelling at the forgotten corners of this distant world, sitting down to take in a stunning vista. Cigalo still plays home to various people, those who can’t or won’t leave, and along the way you can accept quests to make their lives just a little bit easier, helping to slow the seemingly inevitable decay of this planet and its occupants.</p>
<p>The central loop of Caravan SandWitch is Metroid-esque, as you gain new abilities for yourself and your caravan, which allow you to access previously impassable sections of the terrain. The way you do this is to collect components from the various bits of machinery lying unused around the world, before returning them to your hometown for the new parts to be fabricated.</p>
<p>At times, Caravan SandWitch can feel a little stretched out, the component requirements necessitating a lengthy scavenging session, but once you settle into the laidback, timeless nature of adventuring here, any frustrations melt away. There’s no combat, just clambering, scanning the environment and tootling about in your caravan looking for parts, all of which is consistently enjoyable.</p>

<p>For a sci-fi game, set within this crumbling and forgotten landscape, Caravan Sand Witch is surprisingly whimsical. It’s gentle and touching in a way that most games simply can’t be, furthering the idea that indie games allow far more innovation and emotion than their AAA peers.</p>
<p>I love the art direction here – there’s a particularly French feel to the design of the characters and the choice of gentle pastel colours – and it feels like the sci-fi sister to recent games like <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/07/03/dordogne-review/">Dordogne</a>. The fact that it’s paired with Antynomy’s evocative soundscape, the synth-led tones helping to add to the sense of distance, melancholy and mystery, and you have an audio-visual delight that few can match.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/batman-arkham-rocksteady-new-game/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Batman Arkham series developer Rocksteady Studios is working on a new game starring the Dark Knight, according to rumors circulating online.</p>
<p>Earlier today, XboxEra's Shpeshal Nick said on X that he had heard that Rocksteady Studios was working specifically on a new Batman game, not a remaster or remake of previous entries in the series. Apparently, Sony is also trying to money-hat the game, so it may end up being a PlayStation console exclusive.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Not sure which studio people’s dream is, but I heard Rocksteady are back making it. I also think Sony are trying to moneyhat it lol <a href="https://t.co/EfcyRKWdZI">https://t.co/EfcyRKWdZI</a></p>
<p>— Marvel vs CapNick  (@Shpeshal_Nick) <a href="https://twitter.com/Shpeshal_Nick/status/1838116987236655458?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 23, 2024</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Given how Rocksteady Studios' latest project, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league/">Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League</a>, failed by all metrics, it makes sense for the studio to go back to the character that propelled the studio among the most respected development studios ever. Still, without an official confirmation, which may not be coming for some time, we have to take this reveal with a huge grain of salt.</p>
<p>The latest entry in Rocksteady Studios' popular series is Batman Arkham Knight, which introduced a much bigger map than its predecessor, and the Batmobile, which ended up being one of the game's most important features. <a href="https://wccftech.com/batman-arkham-knight-embarassing-switch-0-fps/">Last year</a>, the game was ported to Nintendo Switch with some baffling results, as the game ran at a staggering 0 frames per second in certain scenarios at launch. The game is also well-remembered by the PC community due to its horrible port, which required plenty of time and work to get fixed.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nintendo-switch-2-amd-bid-didn%E2%80%99t-go-through-due-to-handheld-mode-performance-and-efficiency-leaks-suggest-excellent-battery-life.988692/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-amd-performance/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 had the chance to be powered by AMD, but the company lost the bid to produce the next Nintendo system due to handheld mode performance and power efficiency, according to rumors circulating online.</p>
<p>As reported by a new video shared by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@MooresLawIsDead">Moore's Law is Dead</a>, AMD lost the bid due to its chip's performance and efficiency at 5 watts. The company reportedly wanted Nintendo to push the system in handheld mode at up to 15 watts to get truly next-generation performance, but the Japanese company didn't want to push its console that far, as they didn't want to have a heavier battery. Ultimately, NVIDIA's chip provided the same power as the AMD chip with much better efficiency and a far cheaper node, which was very important for Nintendo to keep costs low.</p>
<p>Battery life is likely&nbsp;<span>to be one of the highlights of the Nintendo Switch 2. Judging from last week's&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-new-video-design/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">leaks</a>, the battery should provide around 20 wh, a slightly higher capacity than the original Switch battery. However, the system will consume way less power in handheld mode than its predecessor, granting much better battery life than the current generation console.</span></p>
<p><iframe title="Intel Arrow Lake Cinebench 1T Leak | Nintendo Switch 2 Update" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5qlOQg2mEsw?start=508&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>With leaks intensifying in the past few days, there's no doubt that an official reveal of the Nintendo Switch 2 is not too far off. We will keep you updated on the system as soon as possible, so stay tuned for all the latest news.</p>

            <p>Shirley Curry, aka the "Skyrim Grandma", is no longer posting gaming videos, she's told her viewers. An upcoming eye surgery is going to leave her recovering for some weeks and (more importantly to her) she is simply tired of playing games for an audience. </p>
<p>"It isn't fun anymore," she says <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jNGH8o3LDBo">in a video</a>. "I'm tired of it. I'm bored with it, bored to death with it. So I am making the decision now - totally, finally - I am not going to be making any more gaming videos and uploading them."</p>
<!--more-->
<p>In the video message, she talks frankly about the dwindling desire to record her exploits in games like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-v-skyrim">The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim</a>.

<span data-position="1"></span></p><p>"It seems like I spend most of my time sitting in here at this computer," she said. "And lately... I walk in here and look at my computer and think: 'I've got to make a video today'. And then I just shake my head at myself and say: 'I don't want to, I have no desire to'. And I turn around and walk back out."</p>
<p>Over her time as a player of Skyrim, Curry has gained over 1.29 million subscribers on YouTube, (but she jokes she can count the number of actual regular viewers on two hands). She became popular enough that Bethesda scanned her likeness and have pledged to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/skyrim-grandma-shirley-curry-to-become-npc-in-the-elder-scrolls-vi">immortalize her as an NPC</a> in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elder-scrolls-6-release-date-news-exclusivity-races-setting">The Elder Scrolls 6</a>, whatever it turns out to be. </p>
<p>Now, instead of gaming, she's going to spend time on other interests. And she might make infrequent videos about those, she says. She's fed up with doing it for gaming, specifically. But reading and other hobbies might still bring her to the camera now and then.</p>
<p>"I'm going to start making a quilt that I've been wanting to make for a long time. I designed the
squares a long time ago... and I will show you it bit by bit as I make it.</p>
<p>"I'll tell you something about a book I'm reading, tell you a little bit about it, just in case you'd like to read it."</p>
<p>This isn't the first time the octagenarian YouTuber has cut down on her vlogging. In 2020 she was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/skyrim-grandma-cuts-back-on-videos-after-pushy-comments">worn down by the time and energy demands</a> of making videos and started to do less. But, as she notes in this video, the amount of work would often creep back up over time. It's something she doesn't want to repeat, it seems, as she finds it difficult now to simply stay engaged.</p>
<p>"Sometimes, when I wake up of a morning and I'm so comfy in the bed, and it just feels so good and I think: 'Oh my goodness I've been here all night long, I'd love to just lay here all snuggled up all day long'. Isn't that terrible?"</p>
<p>Not terrible at all, if you ask me. I think about my computer some days and want to do the exact same. It isn't surprising to see Curry face similar difficulties to most vloggers and streamers too - pressure, tedium, expectation, "metrics" worries, personal health concerns... It doesn't really matter if you're in your 20s or your 80s. Work is work, and sometimes it's best to cut it out. My thanks to <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/the-elder-scrolls/after-hundreds-of-videos-over-9-years-88-year-old-skyrim-grandma-is-retiring-because-it-isnt-fun-anymore-im-tired-of-it-im-bored-to-death-with-it/">GamesRadar</a> for spotting this story.</p>

            <p>Ahead of the release of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-xvi">Final Fantasy 16</a> on PC last week, producer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-16-producer-doesnt-want-offensive-or-inappropriate-mods-on-pc-release">Naoki Yoshida asked fans to not mod "anything offensive or inappropriate" into the game</a>.</p>
<p>So far, modders have been pretty well-behaved, but Clive voice actor Ben Starr has of course made it into the game. I was expecting his face to be put on Clive's model (there's still time for that), but instead it's his glowing face from The Game Awards that's been added to Clive's cape.</p>

<p>Other mods have a more direct impact on gameplay. Modder Dehnonator has created a <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/finalfantasy16/mods/15">cheat table mod</a> that unlocks the higher difficulty Final Fantasy Mode from the start - as well as the Arcade mode's Ultimaniac difficulty.</p>
<p>Essentially, that means players can have a higher difficulty level but with base game stats for a particularly challenging playthrough. That appears to be what X user Limitless is running, but without using potions too.</p>

<p>Combine that with <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/finalfantasy16/mods/26">another mod from Dadadada</a> and you really do get Devil May Clive (see header image).</p>

            <p>Tales of the Shire: A Lord of the Rings Game - a game about "finding joy in the small moments" and living as a hobbit - has landed itself a release date.</p>
<p>Tales of the Shire players will be able to take part in a number of cosy, hobbit activities, such as fishing, gathering mushrooms and cooking up meals for their friends, when the game makes its debut. They will also be able to personalise their inherited hobbit hole, to just how they like it.</p>

<p>The upcoming <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tales-of-the-shire-wants-to-fulfil-the-fantasy-of-living-out-your-cosy-hobbit-dreams">cosy hobbit life sim from Wētā Workshop and Private Division</a> was initially slated for a release in the latter half of this year. However, earlier this month, the team announced it was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cosy-hobbit-life-sim-tales-of-the-shire-delayed">pushing its launch back into early 2025</a>, to make sure the game lives up to the studio's vision.</p>
<p>While the Tales of the Shire developer did not announce the release date at this time, as part of yesterday's Hobbit Day showcase (which you can check out above), it confirmed the game will now launch on 25th March. It will be available across Nintendo Switch, PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/netflix">Netflix</a>.</p>
<p>"Wētā Workshop has been trusted with JRR Tolkien's Middle-earth universe for more than 25 years, and over that time we have built up a deep understanding of the lore and a real love of Middle-earth that flows through our creative work across screen, collectibles and now, our cosy sims games," said Richard Taylor, co-founder and CEO at Wētā Workshop.</p> <div>

<p>"Tales of the Shire allows us to inspire our talents in an entirely new medium and, ultimately, create this game for people just like us - fans of The Lord of the Rings. This is a beautiful way that players who are looking for a quieter, more peaceful time can discover this in a less explored corner of this universe."</p>

</div><div>



            <p>Earlier in the month, we learned that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/stray">Stray</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/neon-white">Neon White</a> publisher Annapurna Interactive’s <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/annapurna-interactives-entire-staff-resign-following-dispute-with-owner">entire staff resigned</a> after a dispute with boss Megan Ellison. Reported by<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-09-12/annapurna-video-game-team-resigns-leaving-partners-scrambling"> Bloomberg</a> as a disagreement over attempts to "spin off the video-game division as an independent entity," the details were nonetheless somewhat scant. A <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/what-the-heck-has-been-going-on-at-annapurna-interactive-an-investigation"> new report</a> from Rebekah Valentine at IGN has since shed some more light on the walkout, which reportedly involved “disagreements over the direction of the Interactive division, chaotic departures, communication breakdowns, and a perceived lack of leadership transparency.” It’s a thorough account of some messy events I recommend reading in full, but here’s a brief rundown.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Prior to 2024, write IGN, tensions were already present. Opinions of Ellison within Annapurna Interactive "varied from indifference to latent mistrust given previous reports on her behavior toward employees," with anonymous sources citing "a strong fear of reprisal from Ellison in particular, given her resources, history, and reach."</p>
<p>Still, IGN also reports that work at Annapurna Interactive was "business-as usual" up until mid-March of this year, when employees were "suddenly informed" that co-founder and Annapurna Pictures CEO James Masi had been let go, causing a shake-up that reached right up to Annapurna president Nathan Gary. Annapurna claim that Ellison "reinstalled Gary as head of Interactive, and deemed Masi’s role unnecessary" - only for Gary to also leave the company around the same time. From the report:</p>
<blockquote><p>Sources say employees were told in the following days by leadership within Annapurna Interactive that Gary had been fired along with Masi. The belief that two of their leaders had been fired seemingly out of the blue sparked confusion and fury, and a handful of individuals quit in protest, including at least one other Interactive leader.</p></blockquote>
<p>Ellison then held a video call, and "all the departed staff returned, including Gary and Masi, and discussions began for a potential spin-off of the company". The plan was for Gary and Annapurna Interactive’s staff to form a new company, named Verset, that would oversee currently existing Interactive projects. The developers that IGN spoke to were aware of the plans, and "were reassured their contracts would be fulfilled."</p>
<p>Verset was to become "the company’s indie arm," with former Sony producer Hector Sanchez to lead AAA and AA projects. This included "transmedia properties" - hence the recently announced <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/remedy-partner-with-annapurna-to-co-finance-control-2-and-explore-control-and-alan-wake-tv-and-film-adaptations">Remedy deals</a>. A lack of internal communication regarding these plans, however, lead to employees feeling "confused, concerned, and frustrated about the direction of the company and the future of its Interactive division, Verset or no Verset."</p>
<p>Around this time, write IGN, "discussions with Ellison regarding the spin-off appeared to have stalled out, and in August Annapurna officially terminated discussion." In a statement to IGN, Annapurna claim that "any implication Annapurna was backtracking on the deal is false. We agreed to high-level deal terms and signed a term sheet in early April, which makes it all the more surprising that we never got a response."</p>
<figure>
<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/Stray-close-up-cat.png?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">
 </a>
<figcaption></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Multiple sources told IGN that, in the months leading up to the walk-out, they "began to see signs of Ellison exercising greater involvement over Annapurna Interactive's deals, projects, and budgets in a way that began to make them further uncomfortable with the direction the company was taking."</p>
<p>At the end of August, all 25 employees of the company - including Gary, Masi, and the rest of leadership - signed a joint resignation letter, giving two weeks' notice before departing the company on the 6th of September. This left Ellison, Sanchez, and CSO Paul Doyle "working on a semblance of Annapurna's gaming efforts." Despite the two week’s notice, IGN write, partner developers were not informed of the upcoming resignations. From the report:</p>
<blockquote><p>Annapurna Interactive sources say they received no guidance from the company during that period as to who should tell developers, when, and how. An Annapurna spokesperson reached out post-publication to IGN to deny this, claiming it had active and open conversations with the Interactive staff on how to communicate the news.</p></blockquote>
<p>As it stands now, IGN say that Annapurna have "splintered into two groups both of which are now working to pick up the pieces". On one side, the 25 departed staff that form the remains of Annapurna Interactive ("or perhaps a future Verset"), and on the other, a "tiny leadership team" at Annapurna to support "around 40 projects". An Annapurna spokesperson shared the following statement with IGN:</p>
<blockquote><p>The whole situation is a baffler, but now we're focused on moving forward. We've had really great conversations with an overwhelming majority of our existing development teams and are grateful for their partnership. If our inbox is any indication, a ton of developers continue to want to be a part of what we're building, and we look forward to seeing their pitches. We've also had an influx of quality job applicants and are excited to build a team passionate about our mission to tell original stories that aren't being told elsewhere. P.S. We're hiring.</p></blockquote>
<p>Hiring though!</p>
