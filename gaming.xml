            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Last month, <a href="https://mobilegamer.biz/">MobileGamer.biz</a> reported on how <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-mass-gaming-layoffs-have-begun/">Microsoft's mass 9,000+ layoffs</a> across the company impacted King, the mobile division acquired alongside Activision Blizzard and the home of Candy Crush, with <a href="https://wccftech.com/candy-crush-microsoft-laid-off-developers-being-replaced-by-ai-tools-they-built/">developers being replaced by the AI tools they were forced to build.</a> Now, MobileGamer.biz has followed up with a <a href="https://mobilegamer.biz/inside-king-layoff-lawsuits-toxic-leaders-toothless-ethics-teams-low-morale-and-mandatory-ai-use/">new report</a> that digs further into the chaos caused by the 200 developers being cut from King, with toxic leadership making decisions that don't align with the reasons given for them, and how Microsoft has been making daily AI use for King staff mandatory.</p>



<p>To say that things are not great within King seems to be an understatement. Layoffs are never good for morale, and layoffs that try to replace human workers with AI tools they were building seem to have the potential to hit new lows. </p>



<p>The mandated AI use from Microsoft certainly hasn't helped morale, but one source didn't lay the blame entirely at daily AI use and Microsoft's feet. The fault, as is usually the case, lies with poor leaders, in their eyes. "<em>Microsoft and AI is one cause [of the low morale] but the toxicity is endemic of the leadership team at King.</em>"</p>



<p>That's exasperated when leadership has been making decisions that employees cannot make heads or tails of, for the simple fact that they don't line up compared to the reasoning leadership is trying to pass off to employees.</p>



<p>"<em>It didn’t matter that it was people who worked there for ten or more years or who contributed to the success and earned promotions</em>. <em>Performance didn’t matter</em>," said one source. King has a rubric for its employee performance reviews, but according to a senior manager, nothing about the regular protocols for letting staff go seemed to factor in.</p>



<p>"<em>The logic for who has been chosen to be laid off has been hard to figure honestly…the rationale outlined was our heavy management layer and inefficient product development, but looking at the people let go, it doesn’t align</em>," they said. The reasoning behind the cuts seems even more skewed when other sources claimed several of those cut staff were rehired shortly after.</p>



<p>What's also troubling is the speculation the sources provide as to some of the actual reasons behind the cuts to help fit Microsoft's narrative of a "<em>heavy management layer</em>" and inefficiencies. One source speculates that certain staff were recently promoted to middle-management roles specifically so they could be cut in July. Another speculates that the cuts looked like executives "<em>listed every employee, sorted by salary and then fired them top down, only skipping over people they trust."</em></p>



<p>More on the allegations of a toxic environment and toxic management, one source claims that a key reason for those issues stems from the fact that employees can no longer deliver anonymous feedback. </p>



<p>"<em>Every question or piece of feedback was always connected to a name, which scared a lot of people, rightfully so. As a manager I was always trying to deliver that feedback to the leadership team anonymously, but I was pressed on names</em>," said one source.</p>



<p>Another source was more direct with their thoughts about the current state of the human resources department at King and how internal issues have been left to fester. "<em>HR is indeed a shitshow of incompetent people protecting the status quo of incompetent leaders</em>. <em>Often, they have protected toxic leaders that have been reported to several degrees of accountable people, HR and above.</em>"</p>



<p>Another source added, "<em>HR has often protected toxic leaders and put pressure on the ‘difficult’ employees for reporting the issue</em>. <em>Employees that were vocal and known for being vocal have been targeted by HR on several occasions.</em>"</p>



<p>On top of all this, mandated daily AI use hangs over every employee's head. "<em>AI was being introduced by Microsoft as mandatory a while ago</em>," said a source. "<em>The goal for last year, if I recall correctly, was having a 70 or 80% daily usage of AI on general tasks. And the goal for this year was to get up to 100%, so that every artist, designer, developer, even managers have to use it on a daily basis.</em>"</p>



<p>Another source said they believe there are more cuts to come beyond the 200 from last month. </p>



<p>What's happening at King, and what's happening across Microsoft and the rest of the videogame industry with what has felt like a constant onslaught of mass layoffs for the last few years, will have drastic repercussions on the industry that will be felt for years to come. To say it's unfortunate is an understatement, and to say that it's tragic only beings to address the scope of the issue.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/skate-is-return-to-form-but-will-audience-be-there-to-support-it</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/skate-is-a-return-to-form-but-will-the-audience-be-there-to-support-it.1282128/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The latest entry in the <em>Skate </em>franchise is releasing in Early Access on September 16. Fans have been fighting to have a new <em>Skate </em>title recognized for the better part of a decade, but with a deeper lean into community, live service activities, and seasonal content, is <em>Skate </em>asking too much of its fans?</p>

<p>For the past week, I've had access to a pre-alpha edition of the game and with it the chance to skate around San Vansterdam (San Van), explore the various neighborhoods, and compete in a variety of challenges.</p>

<h2>Drop Into <em>Skate.</em></h2>

<p>Before you get a chance to hop into free roam, there's a lengthy tutorial that takes you carefully through just about everything you'll need to know to get your feet on the ground (board). Led by Vee, your sassy AI companion, you'll get to ollie, grind, perform grab and flip tricks, and get introduced to the city and its various activities.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/skate-early-access-preview-backflip.jpg?itok=yiniN6oQ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/skate-early-access-preview-backflip.jpg?itok=M8CZ1RYY 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>While the tutorial did feel like it dragged a bit for a new player, it's going to be more than worth it to set them up for success as they drop into a world inhabited by other skaters.</p>

<p>Past the Tutorial, there is a story to <em>Skate </em>in the lightest sense. Your challenge completions earn you acclaim, ranking up your standing in the different regions of the world. You'll meet City Councilmembers — who are also skaters — who give you access to more challenges and locations. All of the communication is done over the phone, so expect to hear a lot of voices and not much in terms of world interactivity.</p>

<h2>Skating In San Van</h2>

<p>The core of the game, skating, is just as good as you'd hope it to be for a franchise that hasn't seen the light of day in 15 years.</p>

<p>After learning the basics, you'll be unleashed upon the open world. A nice mix of realistic environments and skatable locations makes San Van feel like a mostly functional city, but one that is filled with fun lines to put your skills to the test.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/skate-early-access-preview-tutorial.jpg?itok=RATm_uOw 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/skate-early-access-preview-tutorial.jpg?itok=X8yd34gV 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>As you'd expect for <em>Skate</em>, you steer with your left thumbstick, and how you move your right stick will decide what your feet, and ultimately your board, are up to. Holding down on the right stick will position your skater to jump, and flicking it directly up will cause you to pop an Ollie.</p>

<p>The <em>Skate </em>formula, balancing between sim and arcade, is a delicate line and while there's certainly an art and skill to performing the trick you're after, there's plenty of open space for a beginner to just wildly toggle and still pull off something entertaining.</p>

<p>To get the perfect line, you can use tools to set a mark and return to it quickly, allowing you to perfect your line without having to worry about setup time. When the game, and some of the challenges in it, require you to perform a pretty specific set of activities, the incredibly low time to reset is a godsend for letting you just have fun and not worry about not getting it the first, second… or twentieth time…</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/skate-early-access-preview-san-van.jpg?itok=62DVleNd 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/skate-early-access-preview-san-van.jpg?itok=VfwGXX1n 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>If you're someone who loves <em>Skate 3</em> for its skateboarding mechanics, this sequel really is "all that and more" in terms of allowing you to create your favorite lines, show off with friends, and even cut together footage. I expect once this releases, I'll start seeing clips of crazy moments or simple and perfectly executed kickflips all over my social feeds.</p>

<p>Additionally, there are a number of settings to make the <em>Skate </em>sim experience a bit easier, or at least more familiar to those who might only have arcade skateboarding game experience. Things like holding forward to push, or easier pumping, let you keep your speed up more consistently, so you can nail those tricks a bit easier.</p>

<p>There's a good level of tweaking in the setting that lets you take baby steps, or leap, when you want to push the game further into the sim style of play.</p>

<h2>Off-Board Exploration</h2>

<p>An interesting addition to <em>Skate </em>is the freedom to explore the world off your board. While you can get off the board and perform simple actions like running and jumping, there's a climbing system in <em>Skate </em>that will allow you to reach new heights.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/skate-early-access-preview-climbing.jpg?itok=P-mHVCac 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/skate-early-access-preview-climbing.jpg?itok=63_n-R8w 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Look for ways to climb up buildings, and you might find a new place to drop in from, or just a place to test out your diving abilities.</p>

<p>This also means in a quite vertically stacked city like San Van, with building plazas at different heights, you can climb a wall from the street level to find a new skating spot, complete with a variety of grindable art installations.</p>

<h2>Customize Your Skater</h2>

<p>As you complete challenges, you'll begin to earn reputation (Rip Score) for the neighborhood you completed the challenge in, as well as currency that can be spent at any shop. Each shop has a variety of 'boxes' for you to purchase that could contain different outfit pieces or customizable options for your board, like deck patterns, decals, and more.</p>

<p>These boxes are interesting because while what you get from them is random, there's a small pool that you pull from, and after pulling an item, that is then removed from the pool. This means if at first a box has 12 potential items, after pulling 5 items, if you still don't have the piece you're after, there are only 7 potential items left to pick.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/skate-early-access-preview-customization.jpg?itok=Cpz2JM7i 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/skate-early-access-preview-customization.jpg?itok=ARqArxJq 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>While it would be nice to just be able to purchase the piece you're specifically after, it feels like a balance was struck here to allow players to have a better chance to pull what they wanted, but also still prompt the players to complete more challenges to earn enough to get what they want. There have been countless games I've played where currency just ceases to be important after I pick up the four or five outfit pieces I want.</p>

<h2>Live Service All Around You</h2>

<p>Something that is extremely clear from playing <em>Skate </em>for even an hour is just how heavily it leans into the live service experience.</p>

<p>Each neighborhood in the world is filled with a few static challenges, but is primarily populated with rotating challenges. Complete all of the challenges, and in a few hours, they'll all be swapped out with new ones to experience. Each neighborhood offers higher rewards and more difficulty, but the cycle is very transparent.</p>

<p>On top of that, each challenge offers just a little bit more reputation and loot if you're playing in a party, promoting getting together and skating with friends.</p>

<p>Something that I was a little bit surprised to see was that there are also daily and weekly challenges for you to complete. Do you want to earn a bit more cash? Make sure you log in and perform 5 Laser Flips today.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/skate-early-access-preview-challenges.jpg?itok=L6vGcQNn 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/skate-early-access-preview-challenges.jpg?itok=HkYP8cNK 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>These rotating challenges and daily/weekly checklists promise to the player that no matter when they log in, there will be something for them to do. Unfortunately, quantity doesn't always equate to quality. Knowing that each challenge is so replaceable and that there's no 'completion' to be had allows you to progress in the sense of seeing your reputation get higher, but there isn't really a sense of progression in the world.</p>

<h2><em>Skate </em>is back</h2>

<p>From my time playing, the skating was smooth, the music was great to jam to, and the casual atmosphere of pulling off a simple and clean line was intact. For fans of <em>Skate 3</em>, you'll be able to hop in and enjoy a variety of familiar and enhanced features.</p>

<p>If you're just here for a chill skate or to play with friends, then you'll have a great time.</p>

<p>If you're looking for real progression or a story that really shows you rising in the ranks, then the heavy lean into live service robs a lot of that from the experience in exchange for a never-ending wave of challenges.</p>

<p>As we get closer to the free-to-play launch, there's a lot riding on the audience to participate and stick around to make the world feel full and entertaining; otherwise, you'll just be skating around an empty city on a hamster wheel.</p>

            <p>
Amid the madness of Gamescom, we somehow skipped the most important game of the year. Cheese Rolling is a multiplayer ragdoll game inspired by the ancient Gloucestershire, England pastime of hurling yourself down a hill after a hunk of dairy. 
</p>
<p>
The hill in question is Cooper's Hill at Brockworth, and the ceremony apparently dates back to at least 1826 - providing you trust the account of that year's Gloucester town crier - which makes the sport of cheese rolling at least 47 years older than Rock Paper Shotgun. The cheese in question is usually Double Gloucester - scandalously, they resorted to a foam replica in 2013 - and is given a strict one-second headstart.

I hadn't heard of Cheese Racing before, but I do have relatives down Gloucestershire way, and now I fear for them. I'm not just saying that because I'm vegan, though yes, I'm tempted to go sabotage the festivities by stealing into what I assume is a closely-guarded tent at night, and replacing the wheel with a large ball of tempeh. But mostly I am concerned for their physical safety and moral wellbeing.</p><p>Apparently four kilograms of cheese can do a royal fuckload of damage when it achieves maximum velocity. 16 people were injured during the 1993 event, says <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooper%27s_Hill_Cheese-Rolling_and_Wake">Wikipedia</a>, "four of them seriously". What. Also, Wikipedia claims that <em>nobody has ever caught the cheese</em>, at least in recorded history. The winner is whoever crosses the finishing line second. So this is just a regular old race, in practice, with a wholly unnecessary and patently unsafe fermented milk modifier.</p>
<p>The official title for the event is "Cheese-Rolling and Wake", and while local historians insist they don't mean "wake" as in "funeral", you do have to wonder if this is the distorted folk memory of a terrible accident at a hilltop dairy. Kind of like how "London's burning, London's burning" is now a charming nursery rhyme.
</p>
<p>
I'm going to contact the organisers and suggest they play <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3809440/Cheese_Rolling/">the Steam version Cheese Racing instead</a>. Created by mercurial developer The Interviewed - their very name a brainlocking allusion to a history of media relations that does not, seemingly, exist - it's more dangerous than traditional Gloucestershire cheese-rolling in that it features an active volcano, but less dangerous in that it is not real. It is totally made-up. Also, it supports eight player sessions and proximity voice chat. There's some paid DLC in the shape of a suit of armour costing £1.48 - as far as I can deduce, this isn't some kind of scam, but tread cautiously, ye who fell foul of the evil <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/fine-lets-write-about-the-stupid-banana-game">Banana</a>.
</p>
<p>
The real selling point, though, is that you can actually catch the renegade curd in this one. My friends in Gloucestershire: thanks to the miracle of modern technology, you need no longer harm and humiliate yourselves in your hunger for dairy. Here is a computer. Behold, there is cheese in the computer! Now all you have to do is roll the cheese down the hill - no wait, not the ACTUAL COMPUTER

            <p>A new <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/baldurs-gate-iii">Baldur's Gate 3</a> custom campaign mod has emerged onto the Nexus like Gale's mitt through that portal, and it's one you'll likely want to check out if you fancy getting nostalgic for one of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a>'s classic siblings. Return to Candlekeep, as you might have gleaned from the title, aims to recreate the prologue of the original <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/baldurs-gate">Baldur's Gate</a>, by taking you to a certain library fortress.</p>
<p>It's not surprising someone's given this a go. After all, daunting tasks as such things might be, a good number of the BG3 custom campaigns being put together with the Moonglasses toolkit have opted to try their hand at taking players to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/an-ambitious-baldurs-gate-3-custom-campaign-mods-first-build-is-up-and-running-and-its-devs-are-teasing-demo-news-soon">revamped versions of locations from the previous two games</a>.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Enter catchily-named modder 786r786, who released <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/18315">Return to Candlekeep</a> this weekend just gone. Re-creating the opening area from the first game, it'll let you wander around everywhere from Candlekeep library, to the inn, and the pool/altar combo that makes up the Temple of Oghma.</p>
<p>You get a good look around these, plus a gander at the custom main menu, character creation screen and camp the modder's included, in the over 20 minute-long tour video below. They don't do much talking to NPCs in that, likely on account of the mod not having any voice acting at the moment, but write in the description that they've pulled across all of the quests and dialogue lines you'd expect from such a recreation. There should be enough to keep you occupied for "about an hour thirty at most", which is why 786r786 has dubbed this a mini-campaign.</p>

<p>There are some teething issues it's worth being aware of, not that such a thing's that surprising given the testing ground advanced BG3 campaign mods still are at this point. Parts of buildings can appear unloaded, leaving roofs awkwardly floating with no supports, while NPC helmets can "disconnect from their head at a distance". On the plus side, cases of long-term helmet hair affliction are likely lower among the residents of Candlekeep than those of the base game.</p>
<p>786r786 says there's nothing they can do about these issues at the moment, and as for whether they'll flesh out the mod more going forwards, they've a one word answer: "potentially".</p>
<p>Regardless of whether they keep at it, this is a cool thing for them to have done, given Larian themselves considered working a return to Candlekeep into Baldur's Gate 3 while they were weaving their development magic.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Last week, it was revealed that upcoming open-world RPG <a href="https://kotaku.com/vampire-masquerade-bloodlines-2-vtm-chinese-room-1851787361"><em>Vampire: The Masquerade – Bloodlines 2</em></a> would launch in October with two of its important, playable vampire clans locked behind $22 day-one DLC. This didn’t go over well with folks online. Now, the devs behind the sequel are planning to make some changes.</p> <p>On August 19, <em>Bloodlines 2</em> developers The Chinese Room and publisher Paradox announced at <a href="https://kotaku.com/gamescom-onl-2025-resident-evil-silent-hill-silksong-2000618460">Gamescom Opening Night Live</a> that the long-awaited RPG sequel was finally launching on PC and consoles on October 21. This followed a lengthy and rocky development cycle, so for many fans, it was just nice to know<em> Bloodlines 2</em> was actually going to come out. However, <a href="https://kotaku.com/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-day-1-dlc-clans-2000618832">people soon discovered that two of the RPG’s six playable vampire clans would be locked behind a paywall</a>, which led to a backlash from fans. Now, likely in an attempt to calm everyone down before a scheduled upcoming stream, the studio is promising changes.</p> <p>On August 27, the official <em>World of Darkness T</em>witter account posted a link to a <em>Bloodlines 2</em> livestream happening today and <a href="https://x.com/worldofdarkness/status/1960639863432085868">shared this message</a> about the DLC controversy as a reply:</p>

 <blockquote><p>We are listening to you about <em>Bloodlines 2</em> &amp; the Lasombra &amp; Toreador clan access, &amp; we’re making adjustments to reflect this. We will share more information about this as soon as possible. Until then, join us TODAY on Twitch at 5PM CEST, where we’ll be showing off the game!</p></blockquote> <p>This is similar to a message that was posted by a community manager in the official Discord server for Va<em>mpire: The Masquerade – Bloodlines 2</em>, as spotted by <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-developer-is-adjusting-its-plans-for-paid-clan-dlc/1100-6534304/?ftag=CAD-01-10abi2f"><em>GameSpot</em> and ResetEra users</a>.</p> <p>Fans were so upset about the clans being locked behind day-one DLC because in<em> Bloodlines 2</em>, vampire clans are a very big part of the RPG. They help determine your playstyle, affect the game’s story, and offer unique powers and abilities. And sure, you can <em>technically</em> get any clan’s powers by leveling up and spending enough resources, but it’s much harder to get abilities that aren’t offered by your selected clan. So locking two of them behind a paywall that requires you to buy an extra DLC or the most expensive version of<em> Bloodlines 2</em> was a frustrating choice.</p> <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-chinese-room-defend-bloodlines-2s-paywalled-vampire-clans-we-have-been-expanding-it-from-where-we-originally-planned-to-land-it">Last week, the devs told <em>RPS</em></a> that the reason for locking some content behind DLC was that <em>Bloodlines 2</em> had expanded beyond what was planned, and extra work had gone into making more and more content for the RPG. I also imagine Paradox wanted extra dollars after years and years of <a href="https://kotaku.com/vampire-masquerade-bloodlines-2-new-release-date-1850804491">rocky development and delays</a>. While I get that making games ain’t cheap, locking clans behind a paywall was never going to go over well.</p>

<p>EA Sports has announced the first title update for Madden 26, bringing along with it a number of fixes and changes to various of the game.</p>



<p>The biggest updates come in the form of fixes to a zone defense, including Cover 2 and Cover 3 concerns where players were falling back too deep, leaving areas of the field open. Also added to the game are three new international stadiums in Germany, Spain, and Ireland. </p>



<p>You can check out the full list of changes coming in the August Madden 26 Title Update below courtesy of <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/madden-nfl/madden-nfl-26/news/title-update-august-28-2025?utm_campaign=mad26_hd_ww_ic_soco_twt_m26-title-update-x&amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;cid=85681&amp;ts=1756310856340" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">EA Sports</a>.

<h2 id="h-august-madden-26-title-update-details">August Madden 26 Title Update Details</h2>



<figure></figure>



<h3>Gameplay</h3>



<ul>
<li>Cover 2 Tampa – The middle defender now gets deeper, maintaining better leverage position against deep threats, especially vs. 3×1 formations.</li>



<li>Cover 2 Hard Flats – Addressed an issue with Hard Flats where defenders were dropping too deep and too far inside before reacting to flat routes. Defenders now drop more accurately with their zone responsibilities, improving coverage consistency in the shallow flats.</li>



<li>Cover 3 Match: Logic improvements for Defenders when reacting to Slot WRs attempting to outleverage the defense on deep routes. This includes Buzz Mable and Zone Blitz 3 playcalls</li>



<li>Cover 6 &amp; Cover 4 Palms – Fixed an issue where Outside Quarters CBs in Cover 6 and Cover 4 Palms were oftentimes losing the press giving up easy touchdowns. We adjusted the CBs alignment so they will no longer attempt to press the WR.</li>



<li>Zone coverage defenders now drop back quicker when shading coverage ‘overtop’.</li>



<li>Fixed a post play animation defect where a defender would do “read steps” when standing in place after the whistle.</li>



<li>Addressed a visual issue around the previous play graphic obscuring the offensive play call formation.</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-playbook">Playbook</h3>



<ul>
<li>Added a completely customized playbook in partnership with&nbsp;<a href="https://x.com/KurtBenkert" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kurt Benkert</a>&nbsp;called <strong>“Benkert’s Dimes”</strong> – you can find it in Play Now when selecting your playbook. </li>
</ul>



<h3>Presentation</h3>



<ul>
<li>Added 3 international stadiums to Play Now, Franchise, and Superstar:
<ul>
<li>Olympiastadion in Berlin, Germany</li>



<li>Santiago Bernabéu Stadium in Madrid, Spain</li>



<li>Dublin Stadium in Ireland</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li>Fixed crash and stability issues.</li>
</ul>



<h3>Franchise</h3>



<ul>
<li>Addressed our UI Transitions surrounding the Player Card. Reducing the transition time it takes to go into the Player Card.
<ul>
<li>Dev Notes: This current fix only addresses going into the Player Card. Our resolution for exiting out of the player card back to the Franchise Main Menu will be in our next TU.</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li>Resolved an issue allowing commissioners to send multiple league invites simultaneously.</li>



<li>Addressed an issue that prevented Edge Players from adding Pass Rushing Traits</li>



<li>Addressed an issue during the Draft where the Draft Board was improperly transparent, showing through to the background.</li>
</ul>



<p>DEV NOTE:&nbsp;<em>Here’s some of the issues we’re aware of and working on a fix in a future Title Update:</em></p>



<ul>
<li><em>Class Import Process incorrectly modifying Player Body Types, specifically Offensive Linemen.</em></li>



<li><em>Players on IR unable to be peeled off the IR list.</em></li>



<li><em>Nose Tackle archetypes displaying a different OVR in the front end.</em></li>
</ul>



<h3>Superstar Mode</h3>



<ul>
<li>Fumble rate chance has been decreased in Snow Games.</li>



<li>Fixed an issue where players would play in the wrong position.</li>

<li>Fixed multiple occasions where players were navigated to the wrong menu</li>



<li>Fixed a text issue where “Rank Down” appeared instead of “Rank Up”</li>



<li>Fixed an issue where progress in Ranked was not visually displaying</li>



<li>Fixed multiple occasions of overlapping text</li>



<li>Fixed an occasional crash when returning to lobbies</li>



<li>Items displayed during presentation did not always match their actual rarity</li>
</ul>

<p>Xbox Cloud Gaming is now available to Xbox Insiders with Xbox Game Pass Core and Standard. The mode, which lets players stream and play their Xbox Game Pass games anywhere, has opened its doors for all Xbox Insiders. In addition, select PC titles can now be played.</p>



<p>Previously, only those subscribed to Xbox Game Pass Ultimate could make use of Xbox Cloud Gaming. While the movement is only for Xbox Insiders, it does look promising that it may go into effect in the future.</p>



<h2 id="h-xbox-cloud-gaming-and-select-pc-games-now-available-for-xbox-insiders-with-game-pass">Xbox Cloud Gaming and Select PC Games Now Available for Xbox Insiders with Game Pass</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>In a <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/08/27/xbox-insiders-can-stream-and-play-in-new-ways-with-xbox-game-pass-starting-today/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">blog post on Xbox Wire</a>, the Xbox Insider Team posted about the new addition to Xbox Cloud Streaming. The service allows players to access Xbox Game Pass wherever they want, like from their PC, browser, or even TV. In addition, you can stream games, letting you not have to download the game and get right into playing. All you have to do is sign in to Xbox.com or to Xbox Cloud Gaming on whatever device you use and play away.</p>



<p>Alongside the Xbox Cloud Streaming, select PC titles will now be available for Xbox Insiders to play, regardless of their Xbox Game Pass tier. In order to make sure you can play, you’ll have to download the Xbox PC app and sign into Xbox. From there, you’ll have a few titles to choose from. </p>



<p>It’s important to note that this is only for Xbox Insiders and has not been released to the public yet. To become an Xbox Insider, you’ll need to download the app on Xbox and/or PC and sign up. You’ll then get access to surveys, previews, and such and help test out new features and updates, like Xbox Cloud Gaming.</p>



<p>Are you excited to see Xbox Cloud Gaming come to all of Xbox Game Pass? Have you tried it before? How do you like it? Let us know in the comments below and on the forums!</p>

                <p dir="ltr">It's been 15 years since <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/skate-3/" data-ref-id="5000-55235">Skate 3</a>, and a lot has happened in the skateboarding game genre since. The Tony Hawk series entered an experimental phase with mixed results, including a physical board controller and the ill-fated <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/tony-hawks-pro-skater-5/" data-ref-id="5000-425445">Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 5</a>, until jumping into the modern remake trend throughout the past five years. Meanwhile, multiple independent studios took a stab at the genre while catering to different audiences--<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/session-skate-sim/" data-ref-id="5000-483355">Session: Skate Sim</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/skater-xl/" data-ref-id="5000-490201">Skater XL</a> experimented with independent foot control schemes with an emphasis on physics to emulate realism, for example, while the OlliOlli series took a more arcade approach via a 2D perspective.</p><p dir="ltr">But amidst all of this, the absence of the EA series was felt. A decade after Skate 3, developer Full Circle, a team that includes series veterans such as Deran Chung and Chris "Cuz" Parry, announced <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/skate-4/">Skate</a>. Not Skate 4, but Skate--a free-to-play, live-service take on the game that's launching in early access on September 16. After a virtual press briefing, I got access to a preview build that served as an introduction to not just what will be available at the start of early access, but the new vision for the series. It's a vision that's placing a big bet on fostering a community made of newcomers and veterans, while also intersecting with the industry trends that have overtaken online games in Skate's 15-year absence.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4556079-skate2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4556079" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4556079-skate2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4556079"></a><figcaption>Some tricks in Skate defy logic, but they look incredible.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4556079-skate2.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Skate takes place in San Vansterdam, a fictional and sprawling city composed of four districts. Your story begins at an odd time to be shredding in those streets--once a haven for fellow skaters, the nicknamed locale San Van has been taken over by the corporate conglomerate M-Corp, and the people are trying to reclaim the city for themselves. In a similar fashion to past entries, the story doesn't have a big presence and is mostly there to introduce the world and give your skater a narrative framework for why you're taking on the so-called tours, which are a series of challenges and short missions meant to teach you tricks and new mechanics.</p><p dir="ltr">The city's introduction and the characters you meet set the tone of Skate, which, at this point in time, sorely lacks a strong identity. The fellow skaters you speak to are the embodiment of Steve Buscemi's "How do you do, fellow kids?," without the purposeful irony or comedy that was hinted at in some promo videos, such as 2024's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qU676XF0jsc">trailer</a> featuring comedian Tim Robinson of I Think You Should Leave fame, which doesn't seem to be present in game. Outside of missions, there's a bot named Veep that often shares history snippets about the city, suggests activities, and comments on your actions, but without a strong personality encouraging you to pay much attention. The presence of technology serves as a comment on M-Corp's influence over the city, which is presented as a gentrified and homogenized setting, clashing against your own expression as a skater native to the region.</p><p dir="ltr">At the moment, there's little sense of resistance or a strong storyline that dives into these dueling forces. It's a far cry from, say, Watch Dogs 2, despite Skate wanting to riff on a similar storyline and tone with the colorful aesthetic for its menus and pushing for the player to express themselves via character customization (the latter falling short on account of the range of options only featuring a fairly simple set of body and hair options).</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4556080-skate4.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4556080" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4556080-skate4.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4556080"></a><figcaption>The game will support up to 150 players in each hub.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4556080-skate4.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">But again, the story is far from the focus of Skate and is mostly there to give you a mission structure and a path to follow to unlock challenges across the districts. The core of the experience is in the skating itself, and for the most part, it feels good. The Flick-It system is back, in which you "draw" gestures on the right analog stick to perform tricks. There are new additions to it, including more late tricks--such as laserflips--and different ways to approach certain maneuvers. For example, you can do a flip and hold the trick, which will repeat it indefinitely while you're in the air, while also controlling the speed of some tricks to perform them slower or faster. The trick repertoire is decent enough, including the usual suspects such as Christ Air, but during the briefing, Full Circle said that it plans to bring back more tricks present in previous Skate entries through updates in the future, as well as introduce new ones.</p><p dir="ltr">The most noticeable difference in feel and flow in Skate comes from its ragdoll effects. This has always been a factor in the series, but past entries also had a distinct weight to your actions, scratching that realism itch by forcing you to calculate speed, height, and distance for every trick you make. This is largely replicated in Skate, but locomotion is a bit floaty, which is frustrating when tackling difficult tricks. During Line challenges, where you must collect bearings along a set path without getting off your board, I'd often skate very slowly after pulling off the tricks I needed in order to finish the line without colliding into a bench or a curb, which could often cause a bigger impact than it normally would and cause my skater to fall.</p><p dir="ltr">While the Flick-It system remains present and there's a vast opportunity for mastering its more technical aspects, Skate's introduction of parkour and air tricks adds a more arcade-style element that is often in conflict with its more traditional foundations. Tricks like Spread Eagle aren't new to the series, nor is gaining enough speed before a ramp or structure incline to perform airborne stunts. But there's a bigger emphasis on challenges that don't involve much skating, and instead task you to, say, jump off the top of a skyscraper and hit different environmental objects or land inside an empty bin. The parkour is serviceable enough, and adds a sense of verticality, as there are climbable spots on pretty much any tall structure. But these components make for a different Skate experience.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4556081-skate3.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4556081" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4556081-skate3.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4556081"></a><figcaption>The narrative framing for Skate isn't all that strong.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4556081-skate3.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">At the very least, there's a push for challenge variety, which is definitely needed for the game's progression, since missions are locked behind challenges. At least in the preview build, one of Act 3's missions required 375 challenge points to access it. For the most part, challenges can reward up to three to five challenge points each, depending on the difficulty tier. Most missions require you to tackle challenges, so you'll be obtaining them in tandem as you progress through the story. Until you inevitably hit a wall, that is, and you'll have to backtrack to clean up challenges across districts. There's just enough variety for them not to get too stale, mostly due to the fact that there are quite a few challenges related to parkour and air maneuvers rather than skating (some mix the two). Yet, they can feel repetitive when done in quick succession.</p><p dir="ltr">It's important to note that almost all of my time playing Skate was on my own. The live-service approach means that San Vans is supposed to act as a shared space for other people via multiplayer. It was hard to get a feel for how this premise will come together, as lobbies have a 150-player capacity. The size of San Vansterdam is spacious enough as is, and it seems designed in a way that it could strike a good middle ground once there are over 100 players together, giving you the chance to bump into other people often.</p><p dir="ltr">In the preview build, I encountered fewer than 10 players scattered throughout multiple sessions. At least one series of quests revolved around social activities, which, while not that common, could hint at some progression blockers depending on server activity. It's a shame, since the brief experiences I had with other players were more snappy, with the two of us contributing to the goals together. I can see how the challenge grind becomes more amicable with company, but there are also drawbacks. If either of you fails a line while the other person aces it on a first try, they have to wait for the other person to run the course again until they manage to complete it. This largely depends on the challenge type, and normally, you don't need to tackle every single objective to complete it, and can just exit it whenever and cash in the points you've gotten up to that point instead.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4556082-skate5.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4556082" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4556082-skate5.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4556082"></a><figcaption>You'll be able to parkour all over the city.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4556082-skate5.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">There are players who will be content with skating around with other people. If you're interested in the fashion and expression aspect of Skate, which has always been part of the series and skating culture in general, challenges are one of the two ways of getting fresh clothes and accessories. The other is, well, by paying with real-life cash. Completing missions and challenges within a district rewards you with experience, as well as the occasional clothing item. When hitting certain level milestones, you get access to in-game rewards like fast-travel points, but also new tiers of Product Boxes, which are essentially loot boxes.</p><p dir="ltr">Product Boxes aren't up for sale--paid clothing options will be available to purchase either as single items on a time-limited rotation, or as bundles--but still function on a chance-based system. For example, I wanted to get a skeleton onesie that is split into multiple parts, and that required me to not only get fairly high levels across multiple districts to gain access to each one of them, but once I got there, I'd then have to spend points on Product Boxes until I finally got each part, rather than being able to select them from an NPC vendor. It doesn't help that most missions rewarded me with frankly boring clothing options. Getting a "rare white tight tee" didn't feel like much of an achievement.</p><p dir="ltr">Speaking of style and expression, the soundtrack is also in an odd spot. Full Circle said that the track list will evolve over time, with the team introducing new songs in upcoming seasons. At the moment, there's a decent selection of licensed tracks from artists like Turnstile, MF Doom, and Sunny Day Real Estate, to name a few. But the vast majority of the soundtrack is made up of royalty-free songs. This dissonance is even more pronounced with the Grabbster feature, which allows you to get close to a speaker and "grab" a song to add it to your playlist, since there's always a chance of you getting an unlicensed track instead.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1587/15875866/4556078-skate1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4556078" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1587/15875866/4556078-skate1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4556078"></a><figcaption>Skate will launch in early access.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1587/15875866/4556078-skate1.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Full Circle expects Skate to be in early access for about a year, although its roadmap isn't set in stone. The first season is coming a couple of weeks after the early access launch, which will also introduce a season pass. As it stands, Skate feels more in line with games like Fortnite, presenting an aesthetic and sense of style that is meant to be shaped by seasonal content rather than introducing a strong sense of identity from the get-go. Full Circle was vague about concrete plans, but the team isn't ruling out collaborations with more brands and other IPs.</p><p dir="ltr">In just a few weeks, Skate will begin navigating a myriad of expectations, and it's unclear which ones the development team will pay closer attention to during the early access period. From my time with it, Full Circle's intentions seem to want to open the doors to newcomers as well as welcome back the people who've been waiting for a new Skate game for the past 15 years. As it stands, this foundation looks and feels different--it's a rather brand-safe take on skating, and some of the new mechanics can feel disruptive. Whether it'll succeed in striking the balance and stay on course remains to be seen.</p><p dir="ltr">Skate will be available free-to-play on September 16 on PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, and PC, with a mobile version for Android and iOS to follow at a later date.</p>

<p>It's a mouthful</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Kirby's big 3D adventure is getting the ol' Nintendo Switch 2 Edition treatment tomorrow as <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/kirby-and-the-forgotten-land-nintendo-switch-2-edition-plus-star-crossed-world">Kirby and the Forgotten Land + Star-Crossed World</a> arrives on the newer console.</p>
<p>Our verdict is already in — and we think this is now, definitively, Kirby's very best outing — but besides the expanded content and new levels, this upgrade also delivers a 60fps performance boost to the base game.</p>
<p>So, how does it compare to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/kirby_and_the_forgotten_land">the Switch 1 release</a>? The indomitable Felix Sanchez has done the maths and put the Switch 1 version up against the Switch 2. From just watching, things should become crystal clear.</p>
<p>Load times, performances, and draw distance are all greatly improved here, with better grass and water textures throughout. We've got a variety of footage for you, from cutscenes to gliding levels, so why not check out the video up-top.</p>
<p>Don't forget, if you want to get the Nintendo Switch 2 Edition, you'll either need to buy the upgrade pack for $20 or, if you don't own the game at all on Switch 1, you can buy the full version physically when it launches tomorrow, 28th August 2025.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>With the original&nbsp;<a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="cd8a1852-2307-4184-b0df-b9afab69154e" href="https://techraptor.net/games/outer-worlds" rel="nofollow"><em>The Outer Worlds</em></a>&nbsp;being one of my best friend's favorite games and as&nbsp;an RPG lover myself, I jumped at the chance to get my hands on the sequel through the preview. It was exactly what I thought I would experience, with whacky dialogue options, time-distorting technology, and brain damage. Here's what we learned in <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="f7b9881c-df25-4849-881d-eafe092b40f7" href="https://techraptor.net/games/outer-worlds-2" rel="nofollow"><em>The</em><em>&nbsp;Outer Worlds 2</em></a>&nbsp;preview.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>A Taste of the World |&nbsp;<em>The Outer Worlds 2</em>&nbsp;Preview</h2>

<p>The preview lasted about an hour and covered character creation and the first mission line. Overall, the story takes you to a colony not patrolled by the Earth&nbsp;Directorate, but under authoritarian control. There's still the silly humor present in the title, but taking out dictatorships remains the goal. You're able to play your way, NPCs recall previous dialogue choices, and actions you take directly impact how the mission plays out. I find this type of gameplay absolutely exhilarating.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

It also has a few inclusivity areas, mainly the ability to create characters with prosthetic limbs. This was great, the limbs are gorgeous, and I loved seeing disabled bodies represented in a popular title. Character Creation is the first important decision-making area of the game.</p>

<p>The focus here is on your skills and traits, which dictate how you interact with your crew and the colony of Arcadia. I played through the preview twice, picking different traits, choosing to get a negative trait, and selecting different skills to see how this impacts the game. My second time around was much smoother than the first with the inclusion of Lockpicking, a skill I find necessary to fully explore Arcadia.&nbsp;</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-outer-worlds-2-character-creation-prosthetic-limbs.jpg?itok=Acfhog3C 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-outer-worlds-2-character-creation-prosthetic-limbs.jpg?itok=dNbDpD_k 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The mission available was what seems to be the first in the game, complete with tutorials and beginner combat tips. There are multiple choices you can make that determine whether you duke it out with enemies or go a stealthier route. The first time, I went with the combat-heavy choice, which resulted in me dying multiple times as I forgot to heal myself repeatedly. The second I became one with the shadows, a far better fit for my playstyle in this instance. Stealth kills are extremely satisfying, especially in a room full of enemies that previously gave me a hard time.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Overall, combat is straightforward, you have your main weapon, either ranged or melee, and support items like distraction devices or grenades. You can heal during combat, but it takes a moment and you can die while trying to get your health up. When it comes to stealth, there are multiple bars showing how exposed to enemies you are, really allowing you to take risks while avoiding detection. If you're creative enough, you can turn Arcadia's own defense turrets on the guards or have the mechs turn on their owners.&nbsp;</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-outer-worlds-2-sneak-attack-combat.jpg?itok=7aLcGXyX 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-outer-worlds-2-sneak-attack-combat.jpg?itok=53YfQAc6 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Arcadia itself is full of nooks and crannies that hide collectibles, like Pitchball Cards. Secret item stashes are littered throughout, making the Observant option highly prized if you want to find everything. Otherwise, exploring the colony comes with the regular items for healing, ammo, additional weapons, and support items. Since the preview is centered around a single well-designed location in Arcadia, it's hard to say when the different areas of the colony will feel like and how well their theme is executed.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Without spoiling the ending of the first mission, it's safe to say it's a cliffhanger that exits with a bang, literally. There are multiple explosions during the brief time I experienced Arcadia, but they really left an impression. I absolutely need to know what happens after the preview content ended.&nbsp;</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-outer-worlds-2-rift-anomoly-explosion.jpg?itok=yxJlCcAF 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-outer-worlds-2-rift-anomoly-explosion.jpg?itok=iFJDcDJ0 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The overall experience was smooth, with no bugs encountered and no odd glitches, enemies in the sky, or clipping through walls. The story is well thought out with background information feeding into the main quests seamlessly. Depending on your choices, dialogue with the NPCs changes, giving you a unique experience based on your actions, skills, and traits.&nbsp;<em>The Outer Worlds 2&nbsp;</em>preview really lived up to my expectations in all ways except the length of the available content.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Left Us Wanting More</h2>

<p>While I was able to play through character creation and the first mission line multiple times, I was left wanting more content. The preview was relatively short. Some gameplay items were left out, like having a Pet or working with a Companion. This isn't necessarily a bad thing, though. I will 100% be playing when The Outer Worlds 2 releases at the end of October. I need to know what happens in Arcadia, why a massive explosion was required, and how I can save the world.&nbsp;</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/lost-skies-1-0-release-sets-sail-for-mid-september.1282071/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer Bossa Studios and publisher Humble Games have announced when you can expect the 1.0 release of skybound survival game&nbsp;<em>Lost Skies</em>, and it's just around the corner.</p>

<p>Per a press release,&nbsp;<em>Lost Skies&nbsp;</em>1.0 will be arriving on September 17th, having launched in Early Access earlier this year. That feels to me like a surprisingly short amount of time for a game to stay in Early Access these days.</p>

<p>Bossa says that&nbsp;<em>Lost Skies&nbsp;</em>is essentially an attempt to create a spiritual successor to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/creators-of-surgeon-simulator-release-new-mmo-worlds-adrift-may-17" rel="nofollow">2017's&nbsp;<em>Worlds Adrift</em></a>, which, as the studio notes, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bossa-studios-worlds-adrift-is-shutting-down-this-summer" rel="nofollow">"ultimately did not reach a 1.0 release"</a>. Still, Bossa says&nbsp;<em>Lost Skies&nbsp;</em>"rebuild[s] upon the strong groundwork" left behind in the former's wake.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/lost-skies-1.0-release-date-flying.jpg?itok=NI6XSdAi 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/lost-skies-1.0-release-date-flying.jpg?itok=LpssuubO 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Lost Skies&nbsp;</em>is leaving Early Access in September.</figcaption></figure><p>The studio goes on to say that it's looking to "elevate the elements players loved from&nbsp;<em>Worlds Adrift</em>" in&nbsp;<em>Lost Skies</em>, and there doesn't appear to be any kind of intentional pun in there, which feels like a missed opportunity to me.</p>

<p>In any case, if you played&nbsp;<em>Worlds Adrift&nbsp;</em>and want to know what you can expect from&nbsp;<em>Lost Skies</em>, Bossa says that elements like "exploring hundreds of floating islands" and building unique skyships from rare materials and parts are very much part of the experience.</p>

<p>You can also expect to confront "some huge sky filling bosses", according to Bossa's Luke Williams. He says the studio has spent the last three years of development working closely alongside the community to ensure&nbsp;<em>Lost Skies&nbsp;</em>is everything it could be.</p>

<p>If you want to get a sense for what&nbsp;<em>Lost Skies&nbsp;</em>is like, then you can check out the official 1.0 release date trailer, courtesy of Humble Games, right here.</p>




<p><em>Lost Skies&nbsp;</em>1.0 launches on September 17th, but if you want to play it before then, you can do so right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1931180/Lost_Skies/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC via Steam Early Access</a>.

<p>A trio of titles are included in the September offerings, all of which are playable from September 2, which also means there’s limited time remaining to add August’s titles to your library.</p>

<p>As revealed in the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/08/27/playstation-plus-monthly-games-for-september-psychonauts-2-stardew-valley-viewfinder/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PlayStation blog</a>, three titles are available to download for free throughout September, which we’ve detailed here.</p>



<h3 id="h-stardew-valley">Stardew Valley</h3>



<p>The beloved indie title lands on PlayStation Plus for September, with an adventure full of farming, mining, fishing, and even romance in the offing.</p>



<p>Still one of the most popular games on platforms like Steam, Stardew Valley continues to go from strength to strength, while developers are working hard on the next title, The Haunted Chocolatier. </p>



<p>Plucked straight into work after inheriting your grandfather’s farm, you start with basic tools and a few coins. From there, the world is truly your oyster.</p>



<h3 id="h-psychonauts-2">Psychonauts 2</h3>



<p>For those looking for a new platform-adventure game to keep you occupied in the wait for Hollow Knight: Silksong, look no further than Psychonauts 2.</p>



<p>With a variety of missions, a cinematic style, and customizable psychic powers, Psychonauts 2 puts players in control of Raz “on a journey through the minds of friends and foes on a quest to defeat a murderous psychic villain.”</p>



<h3 id="h-viewfinder">Viewfinder</h3>



<p>Any player wanting to test themselves with challenging puzzles can do exactly that with Viewfinder, where you use an instant camera’s viewfinder to bring photos, paintings, and sketches to life.</p>



<p>All three titles will be available from September 2, meaning there’s just a few days left to download August’s titles; Lies of P, Day Z, and My Hero One’s Justice 2.</p>



<p>Which of these titles are you planning to pick up and play next month? Let us know in the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

However, Microsoft did not announce when Xbox Cloud Gaming will be available to all Standard and Core subscribers.</p><p>Game Pass Ultimate costs $20/month, while Game Pass Standard is $15/month and Game Pass Core is $10/month. There is a PC-specific version of Game Pass called Game Pass PC that costs $12/month.</p><p>Additionally, Microsoft announced that Xbox Insiders who are currently subscribed to Game Pass Standard or Core can now play the PC versions of select games. To do this, they can download and open the <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/p/xbox/9mv0b5hzvk9z" rel="noreferrer noopener">Xbox PC app</a>, then sign in and select the Game Pass tab to see available titles.</p><p>A Microsoft boss recently teased a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=biXDUvQByBw" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">"more affordable"</a> way to access Xbox Cloud Gaming, and it appears this was the announcement.

            <p>Sony has announced the three monthly games coming to PS Plus in September, available for Premium, Extra, and Essential subscribers.</p>
<p>The three games, available from 2nd September, are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Psychonauts 2</li>

<p>It's a pretty strong line up. Pixelated farming sim Stardew Valley first debuted almost a decade ago, and has since gone from strength to strength. In January of this year, the game's creator Eric Barone revealed that, as of December last year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stardew-valley-continues-its-wholesome-farming-dominance-with-latest-sales-milestone">Stardew Valley had sold in excess of 41m copies across platforms</a>.</p><p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/psychonauts-2">Psychonauts 2</a>, meanwhile, comes from the always creative minds at Double Fine, and was met with overwhelming praise on its release. Edwin Evans-Thirlwell called it "<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/psychonauts-2-review">witty, eccentric and imaginative</a>" in Eurogamer's own review, noting it had a "more developed understanding of mental health" than its predecessor.</p>
<p>Lastly, we have Viewfinder, which is a puzzle game that asks players to "challenge perception, redefine reality, and reshape the world" all with an instant camera. Chris Donlan called it all "magical" in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/viewfinders-built-around-a-single-moment-and-its-great">Eurogamer's Viewfinder feature</a>.</p>
<p>Further details can be <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/08/27/playstation-plus-monthly-games-for-september-psychonauts-2-stardew-valley-viewfinder/">found via the PlayStation blog</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Circana executive director and video game industry analyst Mat Piscatella has <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3lxf3j7pyoc26">reported</a> the July 2025 sales numbers for the United States based on dollar sales from physical and digital game and hardware sales, revealing that the Nintendo Switch 2 has hit a new sales milestone in the US, while EA Sports College Football 26, somewhat unsurprisingly, absolutely dominates the sales charts for premium game sales.</p>



<p>After Nintendo's last quarterly report showed the Nintendo Switch 2 <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-sold-through-6-million-units/">selling through 6 million units globally</a>, Piscatella reveals the console's latest regional milestone, that it has now gone beyond 2 million units sold in the US alone. It was also the best-selling piece of video game hardware for July 2025, both in dollar sales and units sold, and just as impressively, the Switch 2 is outpacing the Nintendo Switch by 75% in the US during the same window when the Nintendo Switch launched in 2017.</p>







<p>Moving onto software, EA Sports College Football 26 won in July, taking the top spot for premium game sales across all platforms in the US for the month. Though it was also a win for Madden NFL 26, even though that game only released earlier this month on August 14. EA offered players an MVP bundle which gets you both College Football 26 and Madden NFL 26, and the MVP bundle was the second-best-selling premium title, behind players just getting College Football 26.</p>







<p>In fact, the bundle sold so strongly, as did College Football 26, that both have joined the list of top-20 best-selling games in the US for 2025, with College Football 26 shooting all the way up to third place behind Oblivion Remastered and Monster Hunter Wilds. The MVP bundle made the list in the number 12 spot.</p>







<p>Other notable entries on the software charts include <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/donkey-kong-bananza/">Donkey Kong Bananza</a>, which was able to grab third place for game sales in the US in July 2025, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/tony-hawks-pro-skater-3-4-review/">Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3+4</a>, which came in at fourth place.</p>



<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/grounded-2-out-now-xbox-series-x-steam-early-access/">Grounded 2</a> was also able to make the charts, but in eighth place when you're looking at premium sales on all platforms. It had a much more impressive top spot when you silo everything down to just PC game sales in the US for July, where it overtook Elden Ring Nightreign, though Nightreign remained at number two.</p>



<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 still has a ways to go if it is going to hit the <a href="https://wccftech.com/switch-2-2025-sales-forecast-bumped-from-15-to-16-million-units-by-dfc-intelligence/">15 million units sold number that analysts predict it'll reach before 2025 is over</a>, but having already surpassed 6 million globally, 2 million of that being in the US alone, and it's not even holiday season, all point to it at least getting close. We'll see how the rest of the year unfolds. </p>

            <p>We're back again, gang. Bang bang. The Doom modder behind Fallout: Bakersfield, which recreates the city of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/necropolis">Necropolis</a> from the original Fallout as the backdrop to irradiated boomer shooting, has followed up their first trailer in ages with some more footage of the mod in action.</p>
<p>Alexander 'Red888guns' Berezin, the modder in question, caught most of us off guard last month, when he whipped out <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/a-surprise-update-for-fallout-bakersfield-the-doom-mod-that-rebuilds-the-rpgs-necropolis-as-a-shooter-level">that trailer</a> for a GZDoom WAD plenty had assumed wouldn't ever see the light of day. After all, Berezin had <a href="https://x.com/NewBlood/status/1537228975906627585">plenty of other stuff</a> on his plate. He's definitely working hard to show it off now, though.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Two new videos have hit the modder's YouTube channel in the past day. One's a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VzZdCmv8AsY">4K version of the previous trailer</a>, because clearly experiencing Doomy visuals in crisp 144p isn't the more authentic way to go, and the other's an extended gameplay montage of Fallout: Bakersfield.</p>
<p>While a good potion of this montage is made up of longer sections you've seen clipped up as part of the trailer, there are some bits that didn't feature there. There's an extended sequence with the Vault Doomweller approaching the entrance to Vault 12, giving us a glimpse through the gear-shaped doorless void at what exploring the massive underground shelter that Necropolis' ghoulish residents emerged from will be like. Plenty of dim, grey chambers to paint with blood, I'd imagine.</p>

<p>Other bits I liked include the moment a bunch of ghouls are set on fire by a trusty flamer and do a bit of a monster mash with their smouldering arms aloft, before being shotgunned. And also, the moment when one just throws up. I take that back, he doesn't just throw up, he actually pukes, then immediately goes to puke again, at which point Berezin pulls up the mod's main menu as if he's decided that's enough ghoul vom for one day.</p><p>By far the best thing about this raw footage, however, is that without the music and quick cuts of the trailer, you really get a chance to take in the mod's eerie and sinister ambience. Thunder crackles regularly, drowning out footsteps that're often the only thing cutting through the tense silence. Weapons prime for firing with satisfying metallic clunks, ghouls moan and murmur, mysterious figures ominously hum as you approach. So gritty a symphony you'd never find if you had a grunge band with sand instruments play on a freshly-salted winter road.</p>
<p>Fallout: Bakersfield's sadly still release dateless as of now, but it's cool to be getting regular reminders that it exists, now Berezin's busy blasting through the bits of it that need work.</p>

<p>Hollow Knight: Silksong’s hype and status are bringing the game perilously close to that limbo state of an indie game and a AAA title. However, I think it’s still in the indie bracket, but Silksong’s price could reflect its years of development and content. Here’s the latest on its potential cost.</p>



<p>2025 has seen <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hollow-knight-silksong-release-date-start-times/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Silksong</a> go from the game on everyone’s wishlist for Nintendo Direct and State of Play showcases to being a literal wishlist item in preparation for its release. Team Cherry has worked diligently on one of the most anticipated indie sequels in history. It’s remained Steam’s most-wishlisted game for an eternity after all!</p>



<p>A bigger game and more content mean <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hollow-knight-silksong-hands-on-preview/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a> probably won’t cost the same as its predecessor, though, so let’s see how much difference there might be.</p>



<h2 id="h-do-we-know-hollow-knight-silksong-s-price">Do we Know Hollow Knight: Silksong’s Price?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>It’ll be worth it, whatever it costs. Credit to Team Cherry</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>As of August 27, Hollow Knight: Silksong does not have an official price tag on PlayStation, Xbox, Nintendo, or PC storefronts.</strong></p>



<p>We’re so close to launch, but Silksong’s price tag is mysteriously absent. <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-gb/concept/10005908" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PlayStation</a>, for example, simply says “Announced” and “Add to Wishlist.” Unless something changes, there’s every chance we won’t find out the full price until the game’s long-awaited September 4 release date.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-much-is-hollow-knight-silksong-going-to-cost">How Much is Hollow Knight: Silksong Going to Cost?</h2>



<p><strong>Based on estimates, predictions, and the size of the game and overall project compared to the original Hollow Knight, we think Silksong is going to cost in the region of $24.99 to $29.99.</strong></p>



<p>Let me be clear, there is nothing definitive to suggest this. But 2017’s Hollow Knight was $14.99 at launch. Silksong is expected to be much bigger than the original—hence <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/why-hollow-knight-silksong-took-so-long-to-release/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">why it took so long to release</a>. </p>



<p>More bosses, more enemies, and more content usually mean more money to pay. If Silksong is anywhere near the level of Hollow Knight, it’s going to be worth it.</p>



<h2 id="h-hollow-knight-silksong-price-tracker">Hollow Knight: Silksong Price Tracker</h2>



<p>We are monitoring Silksong’s socials, Discord, and other sources to try and find out Hollow Knight: Silksong’s final price tag. We encourage you to keep checking back with this article as we will eventually have the answer you (and us!) are seeking.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Final Fantasy 7 Intergrade Coming to Nintendo Switch 2 in 2025]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/final-fantasy-7-intergrade-coming-to-nintendo-switch-2/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/final-fantasy-7-intergrade-coming-to-nintendo-switch-2-in-2025.1282002/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Square Enix is bringing the first part of the epic Final Fantasy 7 Remake trilogy to the Nintendo Switch 2. FF7 Intergrade arrives in 2025, and this is likely the first of two ports that make their way on Chocobo back to the Nintendo Switch 2.</p>



<p>If you’ve been keeping up with the news, this announcement might not be that shocking. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/final-fantasy-7-remake-trilogy-coming-to-switch-2-square-enix-confirms/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Final Fantasy Remake director Naoki Hamaguchi said the Nintendo Switch 2</a> “would have enough power to run the FINAL FANTASY VII remake series” back in May 2025. </p>



<p>It seems the Switch 2 can handle the JRPG after all.</p>

<figure><figcaption>It begins. Credit to Square Enix</figcaption></figure>



<p>The official Final Fantasy 7 <a href="https://x.com/finalfantasyvii" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> account proudly announced Intergrade’s Switch 2 debut to the world on August 27.</p>



<p>“Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade launches this winter on Nintendo Switch 2, running at a stable 30 frames per second, offering smooth performance and crisp visuals,” a message said.</p>



<p>It didn’t specify <em>when </em>in Winter 2025 we could expect it. But it should mean many Christmas trees have a nice Final Fantasy 7 aura flowing off of them, like the Lifestream.</p>



<div><article><p><span>Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade launches this winter on Nintendo Switch 2, running at a stable 30 frames per second offering smooth performance and crisp visuals.</span></p></article></div>



<p>It’s unlikely the Switch 2 receives Final Fantasy 7 Intergrade and that’s it. Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth was a big hit, so I’d expect to see a port in the future. The third and final part should inevitably make its way over, too. </p>



<p>Will you be buying Intergrade on the Switch 2 for some Midgar mishaps? Let me know through the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Scott Pilgrim EX, the beat-em-up inspired by the popular graphic novel series, is getting two more playable characters. Roxie Richter and Lucas Lee, two of the series' iconic Evil Exes, join Scott and Ramona Flowers in their fight against the vegans, robots, and demons that have taken over the city. You can see them in action in the gameplay trailer below:</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RMZ2JNJq5s4"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RMZ2JNJq5s4" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>As you'd expect, both playable exes use abilities seen in their past appearances. Lucas Lee uses a skateboard as a weapon and summons his crew of stunt doubles, while Roxie Richter wields a katana with ninja-like agility. Their announcement brings Scott Pilgrim EX's playable roster up to four, but developer Tribute Games has previously announced the game would have seven total playable options, so there are still three fighters we don't know about yet.</p><p>Scott Pilgrim EX <a href="https://gameinformer.com/sgf-2025/2025/06/06/scott-pilgrim-ex-is-a-new-throwback-beat-em-up">was announced at Summer Game Fest 2025</a>. While it's not a direct sequel, it continues the legacy of 2010's Scott Pilgrim vs. The World: The Game, which was infamously de-listed from digital marketplaces in 2014, but <a href="https://gameinformer.com/product/scott-pilgrim-vs-the-world-the-game-complete-edition" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="3c11da4e-b823-40d4-9b2c-5edca714292e" data-entity-substitution="canonical">was re-released in 2021</a>. Scott Pilgrim EX features a soundtrack by Anamanaguchi (who composed for this game's predecessor) and an original story written by Bryan Lee O'Malley, the series' original creator. EX's developer Tribute Games is also known for its work on <a href="https://gameinformer.com/review/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-shredders-revenge/old-school-thrills-new-school-polish">TMNT: Shredder's Revenge</a> and the upcoming <a href="https://gameinformer.com/product/marvel-cosmic-invasion" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="93e6f4a8-bd26-439d-84bb-14107cc17eec" data-entity-substitution="canonical">Marvel Cosmic Invasion</a>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/2025/08/27/scott-pilgrim-ex-adds-lucas-lee-and-roxie-richter-as-playable-characters]]></content:encoded>
