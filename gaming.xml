The 9800X3D is currently sold out <a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=nOD/rLJHOac&amp;mid=44583&amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.newegg.com%2Famd-ryzen-7-9800x3d-ryzen-7-9000-series-granite-ridge-zen-5-socket-am5-processor%2Fp%2FN82E16819113877">at Newegg</a> and <a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/amd-ryzen-7-9800x3d-8-core-16-thread-3-8-ghz-5-2-ghz-max-boost-socket-am5-unlocked-desktop-processor-silver/6606318.p?skuId=6606318">Best Buy</a>, with the majority of <a href="https://www.microcenter.com/product/687907/amd-ryzen-7-9800x3d-granite-ridge-am5-470ghz-8-core-boxed-processor-heatsink-not-included">Micro Center</a> locations also sold out of AMD‚Äôs best gaming processor.</p><p>The situation is similar across Europe, too. In Germany most retailers have <a href="https://x.com/3DCenter_org/status/1854705891209363749">run out of stock</a>, with new shipments not expected to arrive until later this month.

It‚Äôs not expecting another shipment until December.</p><p>AMD computing and graphics boss Jack Huynh shared <a href="https://x.com/JackMHuynh/status/1854633605785424306">photos on X</a> of people lining up for the 9800X3D at retailers, while AMD CEO Lisa Su <a href="https://x.com/LisaSu/status/1854588860203745312">has been signing</a> some of the CPUs for ‚Äúsome special partners.‚Äù Naturally, scalpers are trying to take advantage of the low stock situation with some 9800X3D <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebay.com%2Fsch%2Fi.html%3F_nkw%3D9800X3D%26_sacat%3D0%26_sop%3D15">listings on eBay</a> asking as much as $999 instead of the $479 retail price of the CPU.</p><p>While there‚Äôs bound to be some pent-up demand for the 9800X3D after the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/14/24220250/amd-zen-5-cpu-reviews-ryzen-9-9950x">disappointment of Zen 5 desktop CPUs</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/24/24278407/intel-ultra-9-285k-benchmarks-performance-hands-on">Intel‚Äôs Core Ultra 9 285K</a>, it‚Äôs clear AMD doesn‚Äôt have enough stock of this new CPU for its launch period.

AMD didn‚Äôt introduce its Zen 4 X3D parts until five months after the Ryzen 9 7950X was first released in September 2022, with the 7800X3D arriving nearly seven months later.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>As part of its Q2 FY 2025 financial <a href="https://www.segasammy.co.jp/cms/wp-content/uploads/pdf/en/ir/20241108_q2_presentation_e.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener">presentation</a>, SEGA has announced the sale of Amplitude Studios, the Paris-based studio known as the developer of Endless Space, Endless Legend, Dungeon of the Endless,<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/endless-space-2-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Endless Space 2</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/humankind-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Humankind</a>, and more recently, Endless Dungeon. SEGA explained this concludes its wave of restructuring the European business, which previously <a href="https://wccftech.com/sega-sells-relic-entertainment-cuts-another-240-jobs-in-europe/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">included</a> the sale of Relic Entertainment and substantial layoffs.</p>
<p><em>The Group recorded an extraordinary loss of approximately ¬•5.9 billion ($38.7 million) in the second quarter for the fiscal year due to the sale of overseas development studio Amplitude Studios SAS through a management buyout.</em></p>
<p><em>[...] The above-mentioned sale of Amplitude Studios SAS has been implemented as part of structural reforms in Europe that the Group has been working on since September 2023. The Group deems that this marks the completion of the series of structural reforms and will work toward realizing a business structure that further focuses on the strengths going forward, thereby tackling achieve regrowth in the European business.</em></p>
<p>SEGA has also discussed the 're-growth of the European business' for its two remaining studios, Sports Interactive and Creative Assembly. The former delayed Football Manager 2025 from November to March to ensure the game's quality. They changed the development engine to Unity, renewed the user interface, enhanced the graphics, and also integrated female football and acquired the full license for the Premier League. For its part, Creative Assembly registered increased sales for Total War: Warhammer III (mainly thanks to the Throne and Decay DLC) and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/total-war-pharaoh-sands-of-time/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Total War: Pharaoh</a>.</p>
<p>As for Amplitude Studios, the good news is that it has returned in the hands of some of its former owners. While saying goodbye to SEGA, the studio also <a href="https://community.amplitude-studios.com/amplitude-studios/endless-space-2/blogs/953-returning-to-our-roots" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shared</a> a message with its fans:</p>
<p><em>Our studio is backed by strong and meaningful franchises and our team is committed to creating the best games possible. With our extensive experiences in strategy game development and two exciting titles currently in progress, we are confident in our ability to deliver outstanding experience to players. This decision allows us to be more agile in our approach while continuing to shape the vision that has been ours from the very beginning, empowering us to push boundaries and be closer as ever of our community.</em></p>
<p>More information about Amplitude's future will be revealed in January when the studio celebrates its anniversary.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/ps5-reaches-65-5-million-units-sold-favorable-quarter-leads-sony-to-up-its-gaming-forecast/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Sony has reported its Q2 2024 financial results today, revealing that its PS5 console has now reached 65.5 million units sold. Hardware sales were slightly down year-over-year: whereas 3.8 million PlayStation 5 consoles were sold this past quarter, Q2 2023 saw 4.9 million PS5s sold.</p>
<p>However, this was more than offset by the increased sales elsewhere in the PlayStation department. For example, game software for PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5 consoles reached 77.7 million units sold this quarter, a 14.94% increase compared to Q2 2023's 67.6 million units. <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-11-08/sony-s-music-lineup-and-image-sensors-deliver-profit-beat?srnd=undefined&amp;embedded-checkout=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">According to Bloomberg</a>, this was largely because of the outstanding success of Game Science's action RPG <a href="https://wccftech.com/black-myth-wukong-reportedly-at-20-million-units-sold-first-dlc-slated-for-early-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Black Myth: Wukong</a>, which is said to have sold around 20 million units (though that includes the PC version). Team Asobi's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/astro-bot-celebrated-platformer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Astro Bot</a> also performed rather well, selling 1.5 million units as of November 3, which is around two months after its launch.&nbsp;Even network services were more profitable for Sony. The PlayStation Plus subscriber base remained at 116 million monthly active users (MAUs), just like in Q1 2024; it was at 107 million units in Q2 2023.</p>
<p>The highly positive Q2 2024 led Sony to revise its gaming forecast upward for the full fiscal year results. Sales have been upped by 4% compared to August's estimate, mainly due to increased sales from third-party games, while PlayStation's operating income has been revised upward by 11%, also thanks to an improvement in hardware profitability.</p>
<p>As a reminder, Sony's fiscal year ends on March 31. As such, it will certainly benefit from big releases like Assassin's Creed Shadows and Monster Hunter Wilds, both slated for February 2025. But it's the next fiscal year that could be massive for PS5 game and hardware sales, with heavyweights like Borderlands 4, Death Stranding 2: On The Beach, DOOM: The Dark Ages, Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, Mafia: The Old Country, Ghost of Y≈çtei, and of course, Grand Theft Auto VI.</p>
<p>The latter, in particular, could help the console catch up to its predecessor (it's currently trailing behind since the PS4 had sold 67.7 million units at the same point in its lifecycle). The impact of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/playstation-5-pro-hardware-the-next-gen-graphics-upgrade/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">newly released PS5 Pro console</a> also has yet to be seen, with Sony hoping it will account for around 20% of the sales from now on, just like the PS4 Pro.</p>

            <p>Following on from her <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-season-two-adds-schitts-creek-star-catherine-ohara-to-its-cast">role in the second season of HBO's The Last of Us adaptation</a>, Home Alone star Catherine O'Hara has joined the second season of‚Ä¶ ok, no she hasn't just joined the second season <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fallout">Fallout</a>. But, the son she left at home has.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://deadline.com/2024/11/macaulay-culkin-cast-fallout-season-2-1236170530/">Deadline</a>'s sources, Macaulay Culkin has joined the cast for season two of Fallout, in a recurring role. Further details on his part remain slim for now, however Culkin is said to be playing "a crazy genius-type character" when the show's second season rolls around.</p>
<p>As Deadline notes, Culkin has already worked with Amazon before, cameoing in its adult animated series The Second Best Hospital in the Galaxy, alongside his brothers.</p>

<p>Culkin will be joining cast members Ella Purnell, Aaron Moten, Kyle MacLachlan and Walton Goggins - who play wide-eyed vault dweller Lucy, squire of the Brotherhood of Steel Maximus, disgraced (at least, in the eyes of many) Vault-Tec executive Hank MacLean and the gunslinging Ghoul, respectively - when the Amazon's Fallout series makes its return.</p><p>As for when that will be? According to Leslie Uggams, who starred as Vault 33 Overseer Betty Pearson in the first season of Fallout, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-season-two-filming-begins-a-lot-sooner-than-expected">filming for season two will begin this month</a>. Meanwhile, in June, Fallout's showrunners said they wanted to get the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallouts-second-season-will-be-out-as-fast-as-humanly-possible">second season of Amazon's adaptation out as soon as it is possible</a>.</p>

<p>Following the immense success of the live-action Fallout television series, thanks to Amazon Prime, it was only a matter of time before the series‚Äô second season started attracting more high-profile names. Of course, season one ended on a cliffhanger, so we‚Äôre all beyond excited to dive in for more, and now we have a tidbit of information to run with. According to a recent report, Macaulay Culkin joins the cast of Fallout season two, apparently playing a ‚Äòcrazy genius-type‚Äô character. I‚Äôm a little curious about the role, and something in me thinks his part involves the Enclave.</p>



<p>In the original report published by <a href="https://deadline.com/2024/11/macaulay-culkin-cast-fallout-season-2-1236170530/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Deadline</a>, Macaulay Culkin‚Äôs role in the television series based on the long-popular role-playing game franchise remains relatively new. The only information we have about his performance is that he‚Äôs a crazy genius of some sort.</p>



<p>That said, Culkin joins a large and growing roster of exceptional stars, including:</p>



<ul>
<li>Ella Purnell</li>



<li>Walton Goggins</li>



<li><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/who-plays-knight-titus-in-the-fallout-tv-series/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Aaron Moten</a></li>



<li>Kyle MacLachlan</li>



<li><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/who-is-xelia-mendes-jones-in-fallout-answered/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Xelia Mendes-Jones</a></li>
</ul>







<p>Following the overwhelming reception to the first season, which debuted as one of Prime Video‚Äôs Top 3 most-watched series and received 16 Emmy nominations, a second season was almost immediately greenlit for production. While it‚Äôs still a ways off, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fallouts-second-season-starts-filming-soon/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">filming begins shortly</a>.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/empire-of-the-ants-single-player-campaign-review.1030488/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/empire-of-the-ants-single-player-campaign-review<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">This is not the anthill to die on.</h2></div><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">It may be nice to look at, but Empire of the Ants‚Äôs single-player campaign is outright terrible and dull. It‚Äôs around 12 hours worth of missions that pivot between being pointlessly easy ‚Äì due to a passive enemy AI that doesn‚Äôt even know how to use powers to buff its troops, which is crucial to success ‚Äì to obnoxiously difficult on a dime, and it doesn‚Äôt let you save mid-mission. Most infuriatingly, there‚Äôs one where nine waves of enemies spawn and attack from all directions, and you instantly fail if you lose control of a single one of the seven nests you have to defend ‚Äì so many that it‚Äôs impossible to upgrade them all with effective defenses. That last wave is a doozy, too, which meant I had to replay it from the start multiple times just to overcome the final challenging moments where they come in large enough numbers to be a threat. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Mixed in with those combat missions are absurdly tedious ones where you only control your single ant as you hunt for tiny bugs ‚Äì which are usually very effectively camouflaged thanks to the realistic art style ‚Äì spread across a big map. You‚Äôre guided only by a non-directional proximity sensor, so you have to run in circles to triangulate each bug. There are also ‚Äústealth‚Äù missions that don‚Äôt actually care if you‚Äôre detected as you scan enemy legions (dying has basically no consequences either), and these similarly amount to running around a map looking for things. Sometimes you‚Äôre told to catch butterflies or fireflies that fly away when you get close ‚Äì the only way I found to do it was to wait for them to repeat their scripted movement pattern and land right in front of me, and that is exactly as much fun as it sounds.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Considering you can climb any object and walk on the ceiling, it‚Äôs surprising that only a couple of the missions make any use of this ability at all, and those that do are mostly the boring, non-combat variety. (There was only one mission where my units fought upside-down, which was very funny because the corpses of dead ants rained down.) Similarly, the only thing Empire of the Ants does with its impressive sense of scale is give you a few objects ‚Äì like a glass bottle or a toy giraffe ‚Äì to run around, picking up little glowy things as you explore them. I‚Äôll grant you that this does remind me of how I‚Äôve seen real ants figure out if an object is something they want to eat, but I don‚Äôt think ants are doing this for fun, and I am not having much fun doing it either. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>I don‚Äôt think ants are doing this for fun, and I am not having much fun doing it either.&nbsp;</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">You aren‚Äôt forced to do all of these missions to complete the campaign ‚Äì you select missions by speaking to quest-giving ants in a sequence of hub areas that serve as a sort of menu ‚Äì but I don‚Äôt recommend any of them, or the campaign in general. The nicest thing I can say about it is that it‚Äôs not all that buggy (other than‚Ä¶ you know).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The other thing you do in these hubs is talk to ants. I haven‚Äôt read the books Empire of the Ants is based on, but if the Wikipedia synopsis is anything to go by this game‚Äôs story isn‚Äôt even close to following them because there are no human characters or secret ant weapons to make it remotely interesting. I‚Äôm going to assume that its numerous conversations about how your nest is threatened by termites and other visually identical ant species or floods don‚Äôt do the novels justice. Even the ant civil war that breaks out is over almost as abruptly as it begins, ensuring there‚Äôs no substance there either.</p></section><div data-cy="verdict"><h3 data-cy="title3">Verdict</h3><p data-cy="article-verdict-paragraph">While Empire of the Ants‚Äôs nearly photo-realistic world looks incredible at first glance, its boring and annoying real-time strategy campaign is the ant-ithesis of that. Combat missions are mostly trivially easy because the AI doesn‚Äôt seem to understand crucial mechanics, and those that aren‚Äôt are obnoxious because you can‚Äôt save mid-mission to replay the tough parts without trudging through the easy setup; Meanwhile, all of the non-combat missions are tedious searches for needles in haystacks and the story fails to make ant politics intriguing. It‚Äôs easily the worst single-player campaign I‚Äôve played in years.</p></div></div><div><div data-cy="review-content"><p>awful</p><p>Pretty to look at but painfully dull and frustrating to play, Empire of the Ants's single-player campaign has none of the depth of the multiplayer and packages bad AI with boring missions and a meandering story.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

But if players exceed 100-hours in any given month, they will have the option of buying 15-hour blocks of playtime.</p><p>Nvidia explained that the new 100-hour cap was put in place in order to avoid increasing the membership prices for "the foreseeable future." The company is also offering a temporary 25% discount on Ultimate and Performance day passes through November 22. Those day passes can be upgraded to monthly or six-month recurring memberships that can also lock in a year without the 100-hour restriction.</p>

            <p>
Nvidia has announced its GeForce Now cloud gaming service will soon introduce a playtime cap of 100 hours a month for paying Performance (previously Priority) and Ultimate subscribers, although additional hours can be purchased for a fee.
</p>
<p>
Nividia shared the news <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GeForceNOW/comments/1glr3yc/gfn_thursday_updates_november_7_2024/">on Reddit</a>, saying the limit would help it "continue providing exceptional quality and speed - as well as shorter queue times". It also insisted the switch from an unlimited allowance would "comfortably accommodate 94 percent of members".
</p>
<p>
Paying subscribers wanting to use GeForce Now for more than the allotted 100 hours per month - equating to approximately three hours per day - will now need to pay extra, with 15 additional hours costing $2.99 USD for Performance members and $5.99 for anyone subscribed to its Ultimate tier. Up to 15 unused hours will automatically roll over into the next month.

<p>
Nvidia's new restrictions come into affect at the start of 2025, but all existing subscribers - as well as anyone signing up before 31st December this year - will continue to get unlimited playtime until January 2026. The company also notes anyone currently subscribed to GeForce Now's Founders tier will retain their unlimited playtime hours for life, provided there's no lapse in their membership. Changing to an Ultimate subscription, however, will immediately apply the new terms, imposing the 100-hour monthly play limit from January 2026.
</p><p>
In addition to its playtime limitations, Nvidia has announced a number of new GeForce Now benefits. Subscribers to the newly renamed Performance tier will soon be able to stream in 1440p instead of the previous 1080p, and ultrawide resolutions will also be supported. Furthermore, all Performance and Ultimate subscribers will be able to save their in-game graphics settings across streaming sessions.

Dino Crisis fans stay in sad I guess," <a href="https://x.com/Jawmuncher/status/1854593201266737643" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">bemoaned one X/Twitter user</a>. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The last mainline Dino Crisis game came out all the way back in 2003, and rumors have swirled for years about a potential fourth game. There are a few reasons not to hold your breath, though: for one, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/monster-hunter-doesnt-leave-room-for-a-dino-crisis-reboot-creator-shinki-mikami-says">Mikami said earlier this year</a> that the popularity of Monster Hunter doesn't leave a lot of room for another Dino Crisis entry. Plus, Capcom recently tried its hand at another dinosaur-focused game, Exoprimal, a multiplayer title that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/its-a-dino-crisis-for-capcom-as-it-abandons-new-exoprimal-content-just-a-year-after-launch">stopped adding new content just a year after its launch</a>.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/08/29/dino-1724928513393.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Devil May Cry's Adi Shankar originally approached Capcom with the mission of bringing back Dino Crisis.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Still, hope for a revival in anime form isn't completely extinct just yet ‚Äî even if it's a little thin.

          <p>Confirming previous <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/11/amazon-is-nearing-a-deal-to-make-a-mass-effect-tv-series/">rumors</a>, <a href="https://variety.com/2024/tv/news/mass-effect-tv-series-amazon-writer-marvel-1236203755/">Variety</a> reports that Amazon will be moving ahead with producing a TV series based on the popular Mass Effect video game franchise. The writing and production staff involved might not inspire confidence from fans, though.</p>
<p>The series' writer and executive producer is slated to be Daniel Casey, who until now was best known as the primary screenwriter on <em>F9: The Fast Saga</em>, one of the late sequels in the Fast and the Furious franchise. He was also part of a team of writers behind the relatively little-known 2018 science fiction film <em>Kin</em>.</p>
<p>Karim Zreik will also produce, and his background is a little more encouraging; his main claim to fame is in the short-lived Marvel Television unit, which produced relatively well-received series like <em>Daredevil</em> and <em>Jessica Jones</em> for Netflix before Disney+ launched with its Marvel Cinematic Universe shows.</p>
<p>Another listed producer is Ari Arad, who has some background in video game adaptations, including the <em>Borderlands</em> and <em>Uncharted</em> movies, as well as the much-maligned live-action adaptation of <em>Ghost in the Shell</em>.</p>
<p>So yeah, it's a bit of a mixed bag here. No plot details have been released, but it seems likely that the show will tell a new story rather than focus on the saga of Commander Shepherd from the games, since the games were all about the player inhabiting that character with their own choices. That's only a guess, though.</p>
<p>Amazon is currently riding high after the smash success of another video game TV series, <em>Fallout</em>, which impressed both longtime and new fans when it debuted to critical acclaim and record viewing numbers earlier this year.</p>

            <p>
InZoi, the upcoming Sims-like from developer Krafton, is absolutely <em>gorgeous</em> - to the point a lot of life sim fans are very excited indeed. So the good news is it now has a release date; the bad news is it's been delayed into next year to give it a "stronger foundation".
</p>
<p>
InZoi, which promises a "complete community simulation" where "every character [acts] on their free will", was initially announced last year, when it was expected to launch for PC sometime in "Q4" this year. Now, however, Krafton has revised that release, confirming Inzoi will be <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2456740/inZOI/">launching into Steam early access</a> on 28th March next year.
</p>
<p>
In a message announcing the news, InZoi director Hyungjun "Kjun" Kim explained the decision to delay the game had been made after reviewing feedback and "analyzing a wealth of data from our various play tests". He added the revised release will give the studio time to "improve areas that need attention" and "create a game that truly captures the essence of life simulation".

<p>
"It is said that among primates, raising a human child to adulthood takes the longest time because humans must be prepared to endure and adapt to their ever-changing surroundings," Kim continued. "The extra love and care that is required to properly nurture a child is how I see our journey with inZoi ‚Äî a game that we will be nurturing together from its Early Access birth. This change in our release date represents our dedication to giving inZoi a stronger foundation, so we can embark on this journey together in the best way possible."
</p><p>
Players did, of course, get a bit of a look at InZoi back in August, when Krafton briefly released its impressively flexible character creator on Steam. During its five days of availability, the demo saw a peak of over 18K players, one of them being Eurogamer's own Jessica Orr, who shared a little of her character creating adventures right here.
</p>
<p>
"Visually, [the demo is] stunning," she <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/what-weve-been-playing-old-brands-revitalised-ageing-classics-and-cursed-character-creators">wrote</a>. "It's a little unbelievable how good it looks, actually, even on lower graphical settings. The customisation goes deep too. It's got all the usual bells and whistles, and even a few chimes to boot, as we're treated to entire categories for things like fake nails... Personality customisation doesn't go as deep, from what I can tell in the demo, but it's nice to see inclusive gender and sexuality options there already."
</p>
<p>
InZoi is just one of several Sims-like that have surfaced in recent years. Paradox Interactive's Life by You has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sims-like-rival-life-by-you-has-been-cancelled-after-indefinite-delay">now been cancelled</a>, but that still leaves the highly anticipated Paralives, also <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/promising-sims-like-paralives-gets-seven-minute-gameplay-video-hitting-early-access-next-year">scheduled to launch into early access sometime next year</a>, and if you fancy something a little more lo-fi, you can also play the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1651490/Tiny_Life/">adorably retro - but still surprisingly robust - Tiny Life</a> on Steam.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/11/07/weve-unboxed-a-ps5-pro-and-theres-also-a-cat/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>The <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/ps5-pro">PlayStation 5 Pro</a> is here, aiming to usher in a new era of higher resolutions, higher frame rates, and more ray-tracing‚Ä¶ but we‚Äôve only taken delivery of our review unit today, so the first step is obviously to do an unboxing.</p>
<p>Also, my cat decided he wanted to be involved for a moment.</p>
<p><iframe title="Our PS5 Pro has been de-boxed" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Z4ns9g2d9jY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>First impressions are naturally quite important, and the PS5 Pro is a solid iteration of the PS5‚Äôs design. It keeps the same inverted ice cream sandwich look, and which was iterated upon for the PS5 Slim by splitting the cover panels in half. The PS5 Pro now segments those panels even further with some gills, hiding some more air vents for the fan to suck in air from the surroundings.</p>
<p>What‚Äôs most impressive, though, is that the PS5 Pro promises a big jump up in graphical performance, but does so while actually being significantly smaller than the original PS5. It‚Äôs roughly the same height, but the core of the machine is skinnier (accepting that there‚Äôs no disc drive attached by default), and it‚Äôs not as deep, either. The original PS5 now feels implausibly big once you pull it out of your gaming set up.</p>

<p>One bizarre design choice is that the PS5 Pro&nbsp;<em>still wobbles!&nbsp;</em>Included in the box are two attachable feet to slot into the gilled section, providing two contact points to anything you set the console on, but there‚Äôs only one other contact point on the case. It‚Äôs certainly far better than the original PS5‚Äôs strange mounting disc, which made moving it for any reason a perilous chore (and also let the console wobble very easily), but you still have a tripod and pushing on a corner will wobble it. I believe this should be improved with the disc drive adding a flattened bulge to the bottom, but it‚Äôs no less barmy.</p>
<p>Outside of that, I‚Äôve quickly run through the console‚Äôs set up process ‚Äì using a network data transfer to copy users across, and with plans to swap an NVMe across to shift the bulk of my game data (which was unavailable within the data transfer utility).</p>
<p>Stay tuned for a smorgasbord of comparisons over the coming days, as I plan to look at and compare the various game performance modes across the variety of PlayStation Studios and third party games. We won‚Äôt be able to hit all of the 55 launch games, but you can expect several round ups of different categories as I work toward a console review.</p>
<p>I‚Äôll also try and gauge what my cat thinks.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/all-overwatch-2-ranks-how-to-hit-top-500/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Like all other competitive games, Overwatch 2 has a popular ranked mode that gamers can play and climb up the skill ladder. With multiple different ranks to hit, getting to the top is no easy feat. Here is a list of all the Overwatch 2 ranks and how you can hit them.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-all-overwatch-2-ranks">All Overwatch 2 Ranks</h2>



<p>Below is a list of all the ranks in Overwatch 2:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Bronze </strong>(V, IV, III, II, I)</li>



<li><strong>Silver</strong> (V, IV, III, II, I)</li>



<li><strong>Gold</strong> (V, IV, III, II, I)</li>



<li><strong>Platinum</strong> (V, IV, III, II, I)</li>



<li><strong>Diamond</strong> (V, IV, III, II, I)</li>



<li><strong>Master</strong> (V, IV, III, II, I)</li>



<li><strong>Grandmaster</strong> (V, IV, III, II, I)</li>



<li><strong>Champion</strong> (V, IV, III, II, I)</li>



<li><strong>Top 500</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>The game follows a pretty standard ranking system, featuring five levels in almost all of them, with five being where you start and one being the final level before ranking up. The game uses Matchmaking Rating (MMR), which many other games use too to calculate ranks. </p>



<p>However, the final rank, Top 500, is quite impressive to hit. Not many games have a final rank that specifies what number you are in the world in the game. This gives players a global leaderboard to strive to get their name on, making the game just that much more competitive.</p>







<hr>



<h2 id="h-how-to-rank-up-in-overwatch-2-guide-to-top-500">How to Rank Up in Overwatch 2 | Guide to Top 500</h2>



<p>To rank up in Overwatch 2 you simply must play ranked matches. As you progress through the game‚Äôs ranked system, you will find games tend to get much more difficult, as ranked uses skill-based matchmaking when putting you in matches.</p>



<p>Getting your name on the Top 500 list is not something that can just be done overnight. Many competitive Overwatch players spend countless hours grinding ranked and never even hit the Top 500.</p>



<p>Still, by winning matches, players can move up in the ranks. </p>



<p>When you first start playing ranked mode in Overwatch 2, the game will have you unranked for a series of games before calculating what badge you should receive. </p>



<p>While your first rank will not be Grandmaster or Champion, some players may start at as high as Gold.</p>

        <p>The series' first time on Steam</p>

            <p>I first played Taiko no Tatsujin in an arcade (in Japan, because I am very cool), where it's controlled by hitting a recreation of an actual taiko drum. It was fun enough that I wish there was a taiko drum peripheral available for PC now the series is on our platform. 
</p>
<p>Taiko no Tatsujin: Rhythm Festival is out now <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2288630/Taiko_no_Tatsujin_Rhythm_Festival/">via Steam</a>, where it offers over 70 songs to drum through, and a subscription service through which to unlock over 700 more. Maybe I should try to get my Donkey Konga drums working on PC, but I'll probably settle for playing it with a gamepad. 
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>If you're unfamiliar, Taiko no Tatsujin games are rhythm games about hitting a drum (on the top or on the side) in time to a beat, as colour-coded notes flow onto the screen from right to left. They're also terrifically bright and silly, your efforts cheered on by a drum mascot called Don Chan. Their songlists skew extremely Japanese, too, featuring a mixture of J-pop, vocaloid music, and anime soundtracks.
</p>
<p>The previous game in the series, Taiko no Tatsujin: The Drum Master, came to PC but <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/taiko-no-tatsujin-the-drum-master-is-out-on-pc-with-studio-ghibli-dlc">only via Game Pass and the Windows store for some reason</a>. Rhythm Festival is the first to arrive on Steam.
</p>
<p>It features the usual mixture of modes, practice sessions, online multiplayer, and several difficulty levels. If you're hungry for more than the songs included in the base game, you can expand your selection with the Taiko Music Pass for a monthly fee, or buy tracks via DLC packs. You can get <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&amp;v=UFFa0QoHWvE&amp;ab_channel=Seatbelts-Topic">Tank! from Cowboy Bebop</a> via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2885010/Taiko_no_Tatsujin_Rhythm_Festival__Anime_Pack_Vol_2/">Anime Pack Vol. 2</a>, for example. Everyone listen to Tank! now.
</p>
<p>If you're tempted, it's worth giving <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2288630/Taiko_no_Tatsujin_Rhythm_Festival/">the demo a whirl on Steam</a> first to see whether the difficulty, setlist, and somewhat grindy structure appeal to you.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>MultiVersus is making major changes to how players can unlock fighters in the game. </p>



<p>Developer Player First Games <a href="https://multiversus.com/en/news/multiversus-developer-series-fighter-road" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">has announced</a> the new ‚ÄúFighter Road‚Äù. Starting November 12, this is the new way for players to unlock fighters in a more straightforward way than in the past.</p>



<p>‚ÄúAt its core,&nbsp;Fighter Road&nbsp;is a streamlined way to earn characters through an easy-to-follow progression track that players can tackle at their own pace,‚Äù the studio said. ‚ÄúThis is a great way for&nbsp;<em>MultiVersus</em>&nbsp;players to get their hands on the game‚Äôs robust and diverse cast of characters.‚Äù</p>



<h6 id="h-related-warner-bros-games-focusing-on-batman-mortal-kombat-and-hogwarts-legacy-moving-forward">RELATED: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/warner-bros-games-focusing-on-batman-mortal-kombat-and-hogwarts-legacy-moving-forward/">Warner Bros. Games Focusing on Batman, Mortal Kombat, And Hogwarts Legacy Moving Forward</a></h6>



<h2 id="h-how-multiversus-fighter-road-works">How MultiVersus Fighter Road Works</h2>



<p>Fighter road has players earning progress towards unlocking one new fighter at a time. The progress is earned through Fighter Road XP that gets awarded via matches, events, and the battle pass. </p>



<p>Of course, if you don‚Äôt want to work to unlock a specific fighter in MultiVersus, you can always just buy them outright with Fighter currency or Gleamium. However, Fighter currency will no longer be available starting with Season 4 on November 12, so what you spend comes from what you‚Äôve earned to that point.</p>



<p>As far as tracking the progress towards fighter unlocks, Player First Games says that characters will be broken down into tiers based on ‚Äúa number of factors‚Äù.</p>



<p>‚ÄúThe first tier, for example, consists of Shaggy, Banana Guard, Wonder Woman, and Batman,‚Äù the said. ‚ÄúWhile characters are unlocked in a specific order in Fighter Road, some tiers allow for players to choose which character they want to work toward unlocking next. </p>



<p>‚ÄúCharacters that are already owned by the player, will be omitted from the Road and, if the player wants to unlock any characters within a tier using their existing character tokens, they can still do so. As players progress on the Fighter Road, their progress will be displayed on a post-match screen that highlights their progress on the reward track.‚Äù</p>



<p>Should you complete the Fighter Road and unlock all of the fighters, any additional earned Fighter Road XP will be converted to Battle Pass XP at a 40% rate.</p>



<p>What do you think of the new way to unlock fighters in MultiVersus? Let us know in the comments, and join the discussion in the official <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums</a>. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/gears-of-war-e-day-will-feature-marcus-and-doms-original-voice-actors<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Gears of War voice acting veterans John DiMaggio and Carlos Ferro will officially reprise their roles as Marcus Fenix and Dominic Santiago for Gears of War: E-Day.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Developer The Coalition announced the news on Thursday, which also happens to be the 18th anniversary of the launch of the original Gears of War. It‚Äôs big news for longtime fans of the series, who will remember that DiMaggio and Ferro played the two leads in the franchise‚Äôs first three games. An <a href="https://x.com/GearsofWar/status/1854584608223813638" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>image of the two stars standing together</u></a> was shared to studio‚Äôs official X/Twitter account.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><div data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>We are so back. ü§úü§õ </p><p>On today's 18th anniversary of Gears of War, we're proud to share that John DiMaggio and <a href="https://twitter.com/RealCarlosFerro?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@RealCarlosFerro</a> are reprising their roles as the iconic voices of Marcus Fenix and Dominic Santiago in Gears of War: E-Day. <a href="https://t.co/x9uaH9R0sR" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/x9uaH9R0sR</a></p></div>‚Äî Gears of War (@GearsofWar) <a href="https://twitter.com/GearsofWar/status/1854584608223813638?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">November 7, 2024</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Gears of War: E-Day is a prequel that takes place awhile before the mainline Gears story got its start. Specifically, it‚Äôs set around Emergence Day, which is known as the day the Locust horde made its way to the surface of Sera to launch its attack on humanity. That means that we definitely won‚Äôt be seeing protagonists like JD Fenix and Kait Diaz from future Gears games, and more importantly, it means that Marcus and Dom get one more game to see how exactly their bond was strengthened.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's not much of a surprise to hear that DiMaggio and Ferro will re-team for E-Day ‚Äì fans had guessed that the longtime Marcus Fenix voice actor would at least return following <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/next-gears-of-war-game-officially-revealed-at-xbox-showcase-2024"><u>the reveal of an emotional announcement trailer</u></a> earlier this year ‚Äì but it‚Äôs still nice to hear that Dom‚Äôs voice will be returning as well. While Marcus lived on to fight in Gears 4 and 5, his partner‚Äôs journey ended with a heroic sacrifice in Gears of War 3. Many believe the duo‚Äôs relationship and the performances behind them are what helped propel the Gears of War series to success, and now, E-Day is attempting to recapture that gritty, gory magic.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The Coalition told us earlier this year that Gears of War: E-Day gives the team to return to the series‚Äô roots in more ways than one. One element set to return in the prequel is <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gears-e-day-devs-promise-return-to-horror-from-the-original-games"><u>the horror that the original trilogy is known for</u></a>. Brand Director Nicole Fawcette and Creative Director Matt Searcy spoke to us about their goals in an interview that took place shortly after the game‚Äôs reveal.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">‚ÄúFor us, it‚Äôs like a what-if story,‚Äù Searcy said. ‚ÄúWhat if the ground opened up and monsters came out?

There are a few highlights that we know about ‚Äì the Warzone revamp and a fresh batch of new maps for Multiplayer and Zombies are the real draws ‚Äì but there are plenty of other surprises hidden in today‚Äôs update that should get players excited. This includes a handful of new Operators, such as one based on the franchise‚Äôs long-running <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/videos/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-official-the-replacer-i-voted-trailer"><u>The Replacer</u></a> character, and information about the launch of Ranked Play later this month.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/11/07/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-season-1-roadmap-1731007980277.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 Season 1 Roadmap kicks of seasonal updates with new maps and modes.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Treyarch says Black Ops 6 Ranked is an experience it has been working toward since 2021‚Äôs Call of Duty: Vanguard. Expect to see it launch November 21 with what the team is calling ‚Äúseveral streamlined features, innovations, and updates,‚Äù including changes to the ranking system to focus more on skill, a forfeit feature, and map/mode voting.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Warzone is another attractive feature coming with Season 1 and includes the previously revealed Area 99 Resurgence map. Every subsection of the map essentially works as its own smaller map to fight through, with the entire setting themed after an abandoned government testing site from the ‚Äò50s that bears a striking resemblance to the fan-favorite Multiplayer map, Nuketown. Black Ops 6 Warzone Season 1 will also see the return of the Urzikstan and Rebirth Island maps as well as the Plunder game mode.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The standard Multiplayer game mode, meanwhile, is getting three new maps at launch: Hideout, Heirloom, and Extraction. Modes like Ransack and Prop Hunt are also coming with Season 1, as are new weapons like the Krig C assault rifle, Sirin 9mm special weapon, AMR Mod 4 sniper, and even a power drill melee tool. Zombies fans can also look forward to three new GobbleGums and a new map called Citadelle des Morts that looks like a dusty medieval castle.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Much of what is shown today will arrive when Black Ops 6 Season 1 drops November 14, but players will have to wait for the mid-season update to see everything the introductory season has to offer. This includes things like Warzone Ranked as well as new Multiplayer maps Hacienda and Racket. Nuketown will also get a holiday makeover around this time. While Zombies additions like the story-driven Directed mode will come with launch, that creepy castle is another Season 1 goodie that won‚Äôt arrive until the mid-season update.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 Season 1 will continue Treyarch‚Äôs strong start following launch late last month.
