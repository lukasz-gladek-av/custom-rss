            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/star-wars-zero-company-permadeath-xcom<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Like many of you, I was raised on <em>Star Wars</em>. I was obsessed with the original trilogy, I collected the action figures, and I desperately tried to convince myself that the prequels had any redeeming qualities. Then I became an adult and realized I was categorically Over It. Disney’s bland-as-butterless-toast spin on the galaxy far, far away hasn’t helped matters. I could have happily continued living in a state of <em>Star Wars</em>-free bliss if not for <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcxnRaZ6slU" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the recent announcement of tactics game <em>Star Wars Zero Company</em></a>, which unfortunately changes everything.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Zero Company</em> is being developed by the ex-Firaxis devs at Bit Reactor, and it sure does look like a <em>Star</em>-<em>Wars</em>-flavored <em>XCOM</em>. But of course, there are many flavors of <em>XCOM </em>these days; what I, in particular, am looking for is a turn-based tactics game where I can get irrationally attached to all my highly-customizable little guys, and then they can die sudden, grisly, and, most importantly, <em>permanent </em>deaths. <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/strategy/yes-zero-company-really-is-star-wars-xcom-and-its-got-the-permadeath-to-prove-it/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PC Gamer’s preview of <em>Zero Company</em></a> makes it sound like the developers are very much hoping to please permadeath sickos like me:</p><blockquote><p>If anything, <em>Zero Company</em> seems ready to take that idea [of permadeath] even further. Soldiers you create can be customised to the class and appearance you want, but appropriately for <em>Star Wars</em> you can also choose their species. Then the game also has authored characters – the crew seen in the trailer and art – who turn up already armed with personalities, backstories, and roles in the story. But not only will they have a degree of customisation too, they're not exempt from permadeath, and if they are lost in some Outer Rim skirmish, that will actually affect how elements of the story play out.</p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p>This, to me, is great news. The last official <em>XCOM </em>game, <em>XCOM: Chimera Squad</em>, focused on a series of authored characters who, thanks to the demands of the plot, could not die permanently. Their preexisting personalities, somewhat paradoxically, also made it harder to imprint on them. The formula works best when you can make characters yours, when their internal battles play out less on the field and more in your imagination.&nbsp;</p><p><em>XCOM 2</em> and its expansion, <em>War of the Chosen</em>, got this right, allowing much more customizable characters to form bonds with each other that affected gameplay and showing them performing various activities in your base. You could even create posters to commemorate big wins – or tragic deaths. Those are the kinds of features that accentuate the drama playing out in your head rather than detract from it. In other words: The Good Stuff.&nbsp;</p><p>It’s worth noting that <em>Zero Company </em>aims to gently ease players into the genre, and as a result permadeath will be optional. I am mildly concerned, then, that Bit Reactor won’t be able to explore the idea as fully as it might if permadeath was baked into the very bones of the project. But we’ll see; <em>Zero Company</em> isn’t coming out until next year. I imagine trailers and previews and preorder incentives and every other tool in the marketing hype cycle toolbelt will tell us a great deal more before the game actually releases. And in the meantime, maybe Firaxis will <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/strategy/xcoms-creator-wants-to-know-where-xcom-3-is-just-as-badly-as-you-do-im-sure-theres-an-audience-for-it/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">finally announce <em>XCOM 3</em></a>. Highly unlikely, but I can dream. &nbsp;</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/kowloon-generic-romance"><h3>Kowloon Generic Romance Is The Closest Anime Has Come To A Wong Kar Wai Film</h3></a><p>Longing, nostalgia, and an unconventional sci-fi tale make for a not-so-generic anime romance

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/south-of-midnight-%E2%80%93-where-to-find-all-notes-%E2%80%93-chapter-9.1169841/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/how-to/south-of-midnight-where-to-find-all-notes-chapter-9/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/south-of-midnight-boring-combat-drags-down-a-beautiful-and-emotional-story/">South of Midnight</a> features plenty of striking visuals, but its strongest aspect is the game's storytelling. Beyond just the cutscenes, the writing in the more than 100 notes in the game's 14 chapters adds excellent context to the story and enhances the experience.</p>
<p>That's why it's worth your time finding every note in each chapter. This guide will show you where to find all the notes in Chapter 9.</p>
<h2>South of Midnight - Where To Find All Notes - Chapter 9</h2>
<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/how-to/south-of-midnight-where-to-find-all-notes-chapter-8/">Chapter 8</a> was very straightforward, with only four notes to find. Chapter 9 has 12 notes, so you'll have to be a little more diligent.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>Burrower's - Feline Intuition</strong> - When you exit the cave at the beginning of the level, Hazel will point out a house in the distance. Once she does, pay attention to the right side of the path, where you'll find a hollowed-out tree that houses the first note of the level.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>Cross my heart... -&nbsp;</strong>After the cutscene with Itchy, head into the small town across the bridge and go inside the house with red yarn on its roof. You'll find this note on your left when you walk in the door, on the couch.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>Dear Santa</strong> - This note is in the same house as the previous note, on a table to the right side of the door.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>Please Keep In Mind</strong> - After completing the combat encounter to the left of the house with red yarn on its roof, where you found the previous two notes, you can enter a house at the back of the combat arena. This note is right in the doorway, resting on the countertop on the right side of the hallway.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>You'll be sorry</strong> - This note is in the same house as the previous one, on the table at the end of the hall.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>Molly Gives A Fright</strong> - After completing the combat arena where you found the house with the previous two notes, there will be a couple of ways to exit the arena. Take the one that leads you past two large bramble vines, and on your left will be plenty of Stigma besides a house with a sun painted on the outside. Directly across the street from the house with the sun, you'll find this note on a picnic table.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>Mandatory Overtime</strong> - Once you've made it into the Pure Pine Factory, head up the stairs that you'll see directly in front of you and into the office to find this note and a Floof knot.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>She Did It</strong> - You'll be able to grab this note after dealing with the tangle in front of Molly's house. As you walk up to the house, this note will be on the right side of the path on a table.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>Why not me? -&nbsp;</strong>Right as you enter Molly's house, you'll find this note on a table in front of the fireplace.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>Dear Miss Molly</strong> - You'll find this note in Molly's house on a table to the left of the stairs leading to the second floor.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>Decision of Transfer</strong> - This is the final note in Molly's house, and it can be found on the second floor on a desk to the right of the fireplace.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>Is it True? -&nbsp;</strong>The final note of the chapter can be found inside the large house in Molly's cave. You'll enter the house through a narrow entrance, and find this note on a bed immediately to your right once you're inside.</p>
<p>And that's where to find all 12 notes in South of Midnight's Chapter 12. If you've followed along with the rest of these guides, you'll have found 69 notes by now. Only 34 more to go.</p>

Many of the most popular school shooting simulators are created by a group known as Active Shooter Studios or A.S.S. </p><p>A.S.S has reportedly created <em>Roblox </em>maps and online games based on mass shootings like those that have happened at Uvalde, Parkland, and Columbine. One of the studio’s most popular maps is “Carbine,” a <em>Roblox </em>recreation of the 1999 Columbine high school massacre which took the lives of a dozen students and one teacher while injuring many more. In “Carbine” players can take on the role of the shooters themselves and recreate the deadly shooting. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.adl.org/resources/article/dark-side-roblox-active-shooter-studios-create-maps-based-real-life-mass&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.adl.org/resources/article/dark-side-roblox-active-shooter-studios-create-maps-based-real-life-mass" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">As reported by the ADL</a></span>, these maps aren’t just simple pieces of geometry that mimic a real world location. Instead they are highly detailed and contain disturbing features. The report says that one <em>Roblox </em>experience created by A.S.S. which recreates the 2022 Uvalde shooting features NPCs that resemble children who will hide under desks and play dead when they hear gunfire.</p><p>Most of the experiences created by the studio reportedly end when the police arrive.

The studio, which boasts a Discord server containing over 500 members, has resorted to using private <em>Roblox </em>servers to host their games behind a paywall. The idea is that this makes it harder for Roblox Studio to find and remove the games, all of which reportedly break many of <em>Roblox’s </em>community guidelines and rules.</p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-04-21/roblox-user-group-re-creates-real-life-mass-shooting-events?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc0NTI2NTU2MSwiZXhwIjoxNzQ1ODcwMzYxLCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJTVVZQOUdEV0xVNjgwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJGRUIzODlCNUI2ODI0RTY0QjY5MENEODE1RTBDREZGRCJ9.P4kaO2hTr9-7PKAgfwWFdDRJ3hKkYOt2_k7LAjKIfa8&amp;leadSource=uverify%20wall&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-04-21/roblox-user-group-re-creates-real-life-mass-shooting-events?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc0NTI2NTU2MSwiZXhwIjoxNzQ1ODcwMzYxLCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJTVVZQOUdEV0xVNjgwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJGRUIzODlCNUI2ODI0RTY0QjY5MENEODE1RTBDREZGRCJ9.P4kaO2hTr9-7PKAgfwWFdDRJ3hKkYOt2_k7LAjKIfa8&amp;leadSource=uverify%20wall" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Bloomberg </em>reports</a></span> that <em>Roblox </em>has removed one of A.S.S’s groups which contained over 800 players after it was contacted by the ADL.

In some cases, they may also encounter content produced by accelerationist white supremacists, which glorifies these killers and aims to radicalize others to follow in their footsteps.”</p><p><em>Roblox, Discord, </em>and <em>TikTok </em>each told <em>Bloomberg</em> that they actively remove content focused on or glorifying extremists  or violent crimes.

Last October, GameFreakOUT is alleged to have posted content including copyright-protected artwork, characters, source code, and other materials related to pokemon to a Discord server called "FreakLeak," after which they were distributed widely across the internet.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Though not confirmed, the materials were likely obtained in a data breach back in August that Game Freak <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-developer-game-freak-reportedly-hacked-stolen-data-on-unannounced-games-as-well-as-nintendo-switch-2-codename-leaked-online">disclosed the following October. </a>Per Game Freak, the data breach included 2,606 cases of current, former, and contract employee names being accessed. Oddly, leaked files began appearing online on October 12, and Game Freak's statement appeared online the following day, but was backdated to October 10 and does not mention confidential company materials beyond employee information.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The leaked materials included <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-developer-game-freak-reportedly-hacked-stolen-data-on-unannounced-games-as-well-as-nintendo-switch-2-codename-leaked-online">numerous unannounced projects</a>, as well as cut content and other background information and early builds of other Pokemon games. Notably, the leak unveiled Pokemon Champions, an upcoming battle-focused Pokemon game, prior to the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-champions-game-freaks-leaked-multiplayer-game-officially-revealed">game's official announcement in February</a>. It also contained information about the upcoming Pokemon Legends: Z-A that has since been proven correct, alongside yet-to-be-proven information on the next generation of Pokemon, source code for various DS pokemon titles, meeting summaries, and cut lore from Pokemon Legends: Arceus and other games.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Nintendo has not yet filed suit against a hacker or leaker in response, but given the subpoena it seems likely Nintendo is trying to find the identity of the person responsible in hopes of doing so. Nintendo historically has been highly litigious about everything from <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gamer-sent-nintendo-a-letter-boasting-he-had-a-thousand-burner-channels-to-stream-pirated-nintendo-games-from-and-could-do-this-all-day-now-nintendo-has-sued-him-for-millions-of-dollars">piracy</a> to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-and-the-pokmon-company-officially-suing-palworld-developer-over-multiple-patent-infringements">patent infringement</a>, so if the subpoena is granted, it is perhaps only a matter of time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

      <div><p>The fallout from the current situation in the United States government continues to land on a variety of industries, but the tariffs have had an outsized impact on the tabletop market. <em>Wingspan </em>publisher, Stonemaier Games, is the latest Tabletop publisher to speak out about a very costly situation for their industry.</p>

<p>The latest action comes from Stonemaier Games, the publisher of <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/wingspan-review-pleasant-from-beak-to-tailfeather" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title=" Wingspan Review - Pleasant From Beak To Tailfeather"><em>Wingspan</em></a>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/scythe-review-beauty-grace-and-style" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title=" Scythe Review - Beauty, Grace and Style"><em>Scythe</em></a>, and many others, as they announced that they are going to be part of a lawsuit against the US President over his tariff usage. Jamey Stegmaier, the founder and CEO of Stonemaier Games explains why they are taking this action some in his <a href="https://stonemaiergames.com/we-are-suing-the-president/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title=" We Are Suing the President">announcement post</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>We will not stand idly by while our livelihoods–and the livelihoods of thousands of small business owners and contractors in the US, along with the customers whose pursuit of happiness we hold dear–are treated like pawns in a political game.</p>

<p>Like many tabletop publishers (import code 9504.90.6000*), we started print runs of products before the President took office, and now we face an unprecedented $14.50 tariff tax for every $10 we spent on manufacturing with our trusted long-term partner in China. For Stonemaier Games alone (a US based company in which all 8 employees are US citizens), that amounts to upcoming tariff payments of nearly $1.5 million.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In the comments he explains that the lawsuit will be filed later this week, and features claimants from across a number of industries who have been directly impacted by the tariffs. They are focused on the President unilaterally creating these tariffs. These aren't the only actions that Stonemaier games is taking, as they also are focusing on sales to other regions, storing games in China with hopes the tariffs will go down, direct selling their newest game <em>Vantage</em>, and are in some cases sending restocks of released games and eating the costs, which they can do due to a buffer they have.</p>

<p>With limited to non-existent production capability in the US for various tabletop games, the industry has been hammered by the 145% tariffs. Many of the games you love are manufactured in China due to lower costs, and the fact that very few in the US have the ability to make the products desired.&nbsp;This has caused some companies like <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/greater-than-games-shuts-down-in-response-to-trade-tariffs" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title=" Greater Than Games Shuts Down in Response to Trade Tariffs">Greater Than Games to shut down</a> due to the tariffs.</p>

Wrestling fans around the world were on board with the WWE engineering a championship run for a man who hadn’t won a singles competition in seven years, and was hardly part of the company over that time period. They were so on board that they gladly sacrificed suspense for fulfillment. This was 20-plus years in the making, and generations of fans were ready to see him make history at WrestleMania 41. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197531" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Disney's New Lo-Fi Goofy Video Is Hiding A Kingdom Hearts Tease" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="152" data-playlist="197531,197530,197527" data-current="197531"><div><p>Disney's New Lo-Fi Goofy Video Is Hiding A Kingdom Hearts Tease</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197531/197531_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197531/197531_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197531/197531_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/23063.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Then, he did.

While everyone treated the Royal Rumble as a formality for Cena to get to WrestleMania, Chief Content Officer Triple H (we’ll get to him later) and the WWE writers were still able to generate shock within this predictable rollout by not only having Cena be eliminated at the end of the Royal Rumble, but also by putting fan favorite Jey Uso onto a well-deserved championship track. Then, after simply being added to the Elimination Chamber <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://411mania.com/wrestling/triple-h-john-cena-wwe-elimination-chamber/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://411mania.com/wrestling/triple-h-john-cena-wwe-elimination-chamber/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">because he’s John Cena</a></span>, he books his ticket to a WrestleMania title match with a win before proceeding to shatter every Cena’s fan’s heart by siding with the soul-stealing Final Boss The Rock and executing the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/john-cena-the-rock-wwe-heel-babyface-turn-1851768147?_gl=1*v0s4fv*_ga*MTc0MjY2NTg1OS4xNzQwMzc1OTc4*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTc0NTI2Njc3OC4yMy4wLjE3NDUyNjY3ODEuNTcuMC4w&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/john-cena-the-rock-wwe-heel-babyface-turn-1851768147?_gl=1*v0s4fv*_ga*MTc0MjY2NTg1OS4xNzQwMzc1OTc4*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTc0NTI2Njc3OC4yMy4wLjE3NDUyNjY3ODEuNTcuMC4w">most shocking heel turn in professional wrestling history</a></span>.

Travis Scott was high and giving Rhodes a black eye. Cena being chosen to be the face of the company by the insidious Vince McMahon was brought up, as was Rhodes only being in the position he is because of Cena’s absence and Rhodes copying him. Everything was set. All that was left was for Cena and Rhodes to put on the historic WrestleMania matches they’ve been known to do individually. Boy, did they not.</p><p>After uninspired fisticuffs, the match devolved to simply an exchange of finishing moves before concluding in one of the weakest endings in WrestleMania history. After getting his lick back on Travis Scott by hitting the Cactus Jack rapper with a Cross Rhodes, the champion wouldn’t strike Cena with the championship belt. Why? By the look on his face, it appears he didn’t want to win the wrong way. Well, that Captain America nobility bullshit got him kicked in the groin and knocked out, making him the loser of the match. No surprise interference outside of Travis Scott, no ruthless aggression, no sustained back-and-forth fighting. It was the equivalent of the WWE shoving the full-course meal you ordered in your face and telling you to enjoy what you asked for. At a WrestleMania that featured Seth Rollins’ surprise alliance with Paul Heyman; Iyo Sky, Rhea Ripley, and Bianca Belair putting on an instant classic triple-threat match; and Jey Uso winning the World Heavyweight Championship, Cena’s title match would be an afterthought if not for the history made. </p><p>Even with all of that disappointment, I’m not ready to give up on the WWE’s grand plan. The most promising sign that the WWE has a worthwhile plan which that terrible WrestleMania 41 main event fits into is Cena’s expressed desire to “<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.cagesideseats.com/wwe/2025/4/21/24412828/john-cena-vows-to-ruin-wrestling-after-winning-wwe-title-raw-wrestlemania-cody-rhodes&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.cagesideseats.com/wwe/2025/4/21/24412828/john-cena-vows-to-ruin-wrestling-after-winning-wwe-title-raw-wrestlemania-cody-rhodes" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ruin wrestling</a></span>.” Earlier today on <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waEZ5NPjLTo&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=waEZ5NPjLTo" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>The Pat McAfee Show</em></a></span>, Cena broke down part of his post-WrestleMania plan, and it quite honestly sounds like the WWE’s version of DC Comics’ Crisis on Infinite Earths in which the DC timeline was reset, liberated of its burdensome multiverse.</p><p>“I’m going to make wrestling start over. That championship is coming home with me, and I will be the last undisputed WWE champion, period. They’re going to have to make a new title. They’re going to have to start the over again.”</p><p>Retiring a championship is truly next-level heel shit. Beating someone to a bloody pulp, knocking someone off of a bridge, and nailing the boss’s daughter to a cross to sacrifice her are bad. Having the balls to remove a championship is a seismic change that could be a smart move. Cena delivering a WrestleMania match that felt like a formality more than a fight and robbing fans of the type of five-star match that requires you to put your body on the line could totally be Cena’s way of ruining wrestling. Imagine if the rest of his wrestling career is centered on simply removing everything positive that fans expect every year, and then leaving with a title they have memories attached to. That would be a scorched Earth plan I can get behind.</p><p>Another saving grace for the WWE is time. Cena has already committed to wrestling until the end of December, with another 27-37 matches left to go after originally stipulating he’ll wrestle in 30-40 matches in his final year. So far, he’s only wrestled in Premium Live Events. If he’s going to hit that number of matches, it’s safe to assume we’ll be seeing him wrestle on RAW and Smackdown. With the championship already won, the next eight full months can be a collection of dream matches and title defenses. Maybe Cena can finally beat Roman Reigns in a Singles match after failing the previous two times. Maybe the sleeping giant Randy Orton goes back to his Legend Killer ways and begins his own potential retirement tour by ending Cena’s with a loss. </p><p>We’ll almost certainly get a Cena/Rhodes rematch, or we’ll riot. If Cena and WWE’s plans are for the newly 17-time World Champion to ruin wrestling, they’re off to a great start.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Some Chinese companies aren’t waiting to see. Anbernic, which makes <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/630797/a-game-boy-for-pirates-titw">excellent and controversial Nintendo Game Boy clones</a>, is already suspending US shipments indefinitely.</p></div><p>“Due to changes in U.S. tariff policies, we will be suspending all orders shipping from China to the United States starting today,” <a href="https://anbernic.com/pages/shipping-policy">writes Anbernic.</a> “We strongly recommend prioritizing products shipped from our U.S. warehouse, which are currently not affected by import duties and can be purchased with confidence.”</p><p>No, Anbernic didn’t set up a brand-new US warehouse in response to tariffs — it’s been an option on its storefront for some time. Generally, Anbernic begins by drop-shipping each new handheld from China directly to buyers’ homes after they’re introduced, then stockpiles additional units in US warehouses for faster ship times. Anbernic lets buyers pick which warehouse they prefer on its checkout page.</p><p>As of last week, Anbernic had <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ANBERNIC/comments/1k1ikq0/is_it_safe_to_order_from_anbernic_at_this_point/#lightbox">already begun suggesting</a> that US buyers pick its US warehouse because “orders shipped to the United States may be subject to high customs duties,” asking customers to “take this potential risk into account when making your purchase decisions.”</p><p>But now, the company is suspending those shipments entirely — similarly to how acclaimed retro game scaler maker <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/651007/retrotink-us-shipments-suspended-trump-tariffs">RetroTINK suspended shipments not just because of tariffs</a>, but “due to lack of guidance on how tariffs will be collected.” I checked: while you can still add a Anbernic handheld to your US cart from a Chinese warehouse, the company offers plenty of warnings and won’t let you purchase it from there.</p><p>One reason for Anbernic’s popularity is that its retro handhelds are cheap, typically around $70 for the newest models. (Some also do an excellent job emulating the look and feel of classic Nintendo handhelds, as you can see in my videos above and below.) But those low prices are now completely under threat by Trump’s tariffs and the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/642601/donald-trump-tariffs-de-minimis-shein-temu">removal of the de minimis exemption for cheap Chinese goods</a>. It’s not clear if or how companies like Anbernic could afford to resume shipments, should those tariffs actually take hold.</p><p>For the time being, Anbernic handhelds are also still available in the US via third-party sellers like Amazon — which I’ve always found surprising given that those ones typically come with Nintendo, Sega and Sony ROMs.</p><div><p><a href="https://retrohandhelds.gg/tariffs/"><em>Retro Handhelds</em> has a handy regularly updated page</a> keeping track of handheld tariffs; so far, Anbernic is the only one to suspend US shipments entirely.</p></div></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

They also had many of these upcoming releases on display at the show.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">IGN was able to snap some photos of Hasbro's Star Wars Celebration display and speak to designer Chris Reiff and Hasbro Marketing's Jing Houle about the thrill of designing toys based on these iconic characters. Check out the slideshow gallery below for a closer look at these new toys, and then read on to find out what Reiff and Houle had to say, including why there's still room to improve with some of the biggest heroes of the Star Wars franchise.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Star Wars Jedi: Survivor fans were no doubt pleased to see new figures included in this new crop of Star Wars toys. Nightsister Merrin is getting a new figure (<a href="https://zdcs.link/QKOrp8?object_uuid=7a4d7785-2b5c-433d-89ce-6009126c41a6&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">see it at Amazon</a>), while series star Cal Kestis is featured in a three-pack set alongside Turgle and Skoova Stev (<a href="https://zdcs.link/QL5mKb?object_uuid=7a4d7785-2b5c-433d-89ce-6009126c41a6&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" data-aps-asin="B0DKL96SMQ" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Amazon</a>). And best of all, Cal comes with multiple swap-out heads, including one with handlebar mustache. According to Houle, that particular look was a big priority for this release.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Hasbro's Star Wars Celebration 2025 Display Booth</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"Honestly, we just wanted to have fun with it," Houle tells IGN. "This is one of my favorite packs that we revealed in the panel. We actually started with the handlebar mustache and the mullet and then added in the clean cut. Then the short beard later. So for us, the primary look is almost the handlebar and it's just so much fun."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for Merrin, it was a given that Cal be joined by his crewmate,  given how important Merrin is to the larger Fallen Order/Survivor saga. The challenge was properly depicting her unique Force abilities.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"It's tough to have Cal without Merrin," Reiff says. "So we're glad we finally got to Merrin, but doing that Force effect, the green blast coming there, all the great detail of that new costume and the face tattoos with the inkjet. Just some beautiful subtlety going on there. She's a really cool character I know we know fans are invested in and really being able to build out that world."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This year's toy lineup includes two characters who are certainly no strangers to Hasbro by now - Han Solo and Chewbacca. (See <a href="https://zdcs.link/z6o13Z?object_uuid=7a4d7785-2b5c-433d-89ce-6009126c41a6&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" data-aps-asin="B0DGJ1HX1P" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Han</a> and <a href="https://zdcs.link/924YN5?object_uuid=7a4d7785-2b5c-433d-89ce-6009126c41a6&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" data-aps-asin="B0DGJ58GHR" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Chewie</a> at Amazon) But despite how many Han and Chewie figures we've seen over the years, Houle is adamant that there's room for improvement.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I mean, we haven't done them in a long time," Houle says. "They needed an update, so we gave them fully new tools so they're brand new with the latest articulation so that fans can really celebrate and enjoy... classic characters out again in the latest technology and articulation that we have. And they've made quite a few updates on top of the articulation just in general. We learned a lot from the Wookiees that we've done where they have really long hair."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Houle continues, "And so, despite the long hair, having softer plastics so he can still pivot and move his head in a seamless way, that was really important to us. And we added articulation into Han too, but we didn't give him the thigh break because we didn't want to separate the red bars on his right side of the outside of the thigh. So we thought it was important to keep that clean. So we added articulation to the top of the boot instead."</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Everything Revealed at Hasbro's Star Wars Celebration 2025 Panel</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">No figure in this lineup is more striking than The Ronin, based on the anime anthology series Star Wars: Visions. True to the series, The Ronin is a black-and-white figure whose only color comes from his red katana lightsaber. Because The Ronin is a Celebration-exclusive release, it was important to both Houle and Reiff that they get the small details right.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I love that we kept to it," Houle says. "And then taking from learnings from what we know about Japanese culture and stuff, the way the box is built, how premium it looks, the magnets that let it open, how clean it looks, the watercoloring, the accessories that's hidden on the top of the box so you don't just see it. Everything. There was so much attention from packaging to design to engineering."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Reiff adds, "And even the Japanese language for this exclusive packaging, we don't do that normally, but for here, because we're here in Japan, we wanted to really embrace all that and do a special package that was just Japanese language for that too."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Finally, Hasbro also had something for fans of the 1:1 scale Black Series helmet line, revealing a stunningly detailed Death Trooper helmet during their Celebration panel. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"[It's] a great fully new tooled helmet for the Black series Premium roleplay line," Reiff says. "It looks like it's straight out of the movie with the weathering, the lighting detail, and you poke a button on the side and you control the chin lights and the spectre sensor lights over on the side. So, just a great addition to our line. And working with Lucasfilm in partnership to work from original files so that we could really nail all the details of this helmet and then add our own stuff to the inside because the real ones never had an inside, but this one does. All our other helmets, it has the full detailed interior."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">For more on Star Wars Celebration, find out <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/star-wars-starfighter-movie-ryan-glosling-plot-story-timeline">what we know about the plot of Star Wars: Starfighter</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/star-wars-celebration-japan-2025-the-biggest-news-and-moments">see the biggest news and moments from Celebration</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Jesse is a mild-mannered staff writer for IGN.

			<p>Blizzard will give players a complete and detailed look at Diablo IV's Season 8: Belial's Return this <a href="https://wccftech.com/blizzard-will-detail-diablo-ivs-season-8-belials-return-on-april-24/">Thursday, April 24, 2025</a>. However, a new gameplay trailer for Season 8 shows off some of the new boss attacks and lair bosses players will be able to use.</p>
<p>Blizzard <a href="https://news.blizzard.com/en-us/article/24189530/combat-deception-in-season-8-belials-return#Deliver">published</a> a detailed blog post delving deeper into combat in Season 8 and the new gameplay trailer. For example, regarding boss powers, there are 24 bosses players can pull attacks from, with each having a main and a modifier effect. We also got a complete list of the boss attacks players can utilize.</p>
<p><iframe title="Diablo IV | Belial's Return | Gameplay Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rUlRtsPBg-w?start=83&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Specific boss attacks can be acquired at any difficulty level, while others are only available at Torment I or higher levels. Regarding difficulty levels, Blizzard now has a new tiered system for what were previously considered endgame bosses, with a reworking of its lair bosses.</p>
<p>There are three tiers to lair bosses now: Initiate, Greater, and Exalted. These bosses are only available to you if you're playing on Torment I or a higher difficulty level, and you'll also need to own the Vessel of Hatred expansion.</p>
<p>Blizzard also detailed a few new legendary and unique items players can grind for in Season 8, with new items for Barbarian, Necromancer, Sorcerer, Druid, Rogue, and Spiritborn players.</p>
<p>Another significant change in Season 8 is the introduction of Reliquaries, which is a new way to earn rewards and a "<em>refresh</em>" of the battle pass system in Diablo IV. You'll need to purchase most Reliquaries using Platinum, while certain milestone events will have Reliquaries attached to them upon completion.</p>
<p>There's still more to come later in the week ahead of the launch of Belial's Return on April 29, 2025.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/wizards-of-coast-announces-through-omenpaths-bringing-crossover-sets-to-magic</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/wizards-of-the-coast-announces-through-the-omenpaths-bringing-crossover-sets-to-magic-the-gathering-arena.1169733/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/wizards-of-coast-announces-through-omenpaths-bringing-crossover-sets-to-magic<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Digital Universes Beyond sets are coming to <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/magic-gathering-arena" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Magic: The Gathering Arena</em></a> and <em>Magic Online</em>. Wizards of the Coast has announced a new set called <em>Through the Omenpaths</em>, which will bring certain crossovers to the digital spin-offs of the popular card game.</p>

<h2><em>Through the Omenpaths</em> Announcement</h2>

<p>In an official <a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/news/announcements/through-the-omenpaths-and-digital-universes-beyond-updates" rel="nofollow">blog post</a>, Wizards of the Coast's own Blake Rasmussen explains <em>Through the Omenpaths</em> was created to answer a persistent question by the <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/magic-the-gathering" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Magic: The Gathering</em></a> community: "Will this Univeres Beyond set be available digitally?" This is important since the answer to this question has been inconsistent.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/magic-the-gathering-universes-beyond-nick-valentine-card-artwork.jpg?itok=oJi6Hv7r 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/magic-the-gathering-universes-beyond-nick-valentine-card-artwork.jpg?itok=djboQD-F 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Simply put, <em>Through the Omenpaths</em> will introduce Universes Within versions of certain crossover sets. This means cards that are mechanically similar, but represented with different artwork, names, and creative treatments.</p>

<p>This doesn't mean that every Univeres Beyond set will be getting the <em>Through the Omenpaths</em> treatment. The only sets coming are for full sets that are legal in play formats. Also, if the Universes Beyond set is already available digitally, it will not show up here.</p>

<p>Lastly, if you were interested in seeing how <em>Through the Omenpaths</em> will interpret the upcoming <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/new-magic-gathering-marvel-crossover-details-revealed-including-new-secret-lair-and" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Marvel's Spider-Man</em></a> set, you will be disappointed. Wizards of the Coast has confirmed that Spider-Man and all future Marvel crossover sets will not be coming digitally.</p>

<p>The announcement addresses an issue regarding parity between the digital and physical versions of <em>Magic</em>. Starting this year, WOTC confirmed that all Universes Beyond sets will be legal in all play formats. If all cards in these sets aren't available in Magic Arena or Online, that would mean a very different play environment and meta.</p>

<p>The first two upcoming <em>Magic</em> crossover sets coming via <em>Through The Omenpaths</em>, <em>Final Fantasy</em>, and <em>Avatar: The Last Airbender</em>, will be available September 23.</p>

<p>CodeWeavers' CEO <a href="https://www.codeweavers.com/blog/jramey/2025/4/18/whisky-s-legacy-and-the-spirit-it-leaves-behind">wrote on the company's blog</a> late last week about the Whisky shutdown, topped with an image of a glass of the spirit clinking against a glass of wine. "Whisky may have been a CrossOver competitor, but that's not how we feel today," wrote James B. Ramey. "Our response is simply one of empathy, understanding, and acknowledgement for Isaac's situation."</p>
<p>Ramey noted that Whisky was a free packaging of an open source project, crafted by someone who, like CrossOver, did it as "a labor of love built by people who care deeply about giving users more choices." But Marovitz faced "an avalanche of user expectations," Ramey wrote, regarding game compatibility, performance, and features. "The reality is that testing, support, and development take real resources … if CodeWeavers were not viable because of CrossOver not being sustainable, it would likely dampen the future development of WINE and Proton and support for macOS gaming," Ramey wrote.</p>
<p>"We ‘tip our cap’ to Isaac and the impact he made to macOS gaming," Ramey wrote, strangely choosing that colloquial salute instead of the more obvious beverage analogy for the two projects.</p>
<p>Marovitz told Ars that while user expectations were "definitely an issue," they were not the major reason for ceasing development. "I've worked on other big projects before and during Whisky's development, so I'm not a stranger to tuning out the noise of constant user expectations."</p>
<p>Open source projects shutting down because of the tremendous pressure they put on their unpaid coders is a kind of "dog bites man" story in the coding world. It's something else entirely when a prolific coder sees a larger ecosystem as not really benefiting from their otherwise very neat tool, and chooses deference. Still, during its run, the Whisky app drew attention to Mac gaming and the possibilities of Wine, and by extension <a href="https://arstechnica.com/apple/2023/06/apple-has-a-proton-like-game-porting-toolkit-for-getting-windows-games-on-mac/">Apple's own Game Porting Toolkit</a>, itself based on CrossOver. And likely gave a few Mac owners some great times with games they couldn't get on their favorite platform.</p>
<p>Marovitz, while stepping back, is not done with Mac gaming, however. "Right now I'm working on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/isaacmarovitz.com/post/3lm6dlebkk22o">the recompilation of <em>Sonic Unleashed</em></a> and bringing it fully to Mac, alongside other folks, but for the most part my goals and passions have remained the same," Marovitz told Ars.</p>

Three of the modes for Cyberpunk 2077 on the system will aim for 1080p: both docked options and quality mode during handheld mode.

The big update introduces the Specialist operators from Black Ops 4, and it adds in a new Chase map that features jetpacks. The game's battle royale mode also gets jump pads.</p><p dir="ltr">Season 4: Infinity Realm starts on April 23 at 5 PM PT / 8 PM ET. This new season includes a brand-new battle pass with both free and premium items. The Infinity Realm battle pass features items with sci-fi aesthetics, including futuristic operator skins and weapon blueprints.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4479940-codm-s4-announce-004.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4479940" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4479940-codm-s4-announce-004.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4479940"></a><figcaption>Vargo-S assault rifle</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4479940-codm-s4-announce-004.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Highlights of the free battle-pass tiers include Season 4's new Vargo-S assault rifle. For the premium tiers, players can unlock operator skins for Beatrice and Woods. Futuristic weapon blueprints are included in the premium pass for the Vargo-S, as well as the Bruen MK9 light machine gun, the Type 19 assault rifle, and the Switchblade X9 submachine gun.</p><p dir="ltr">Infinity Realm adds in a Black Ops 4 Reloaded multiplayer playlist that pays homage to 2018's Black Ops 4. This playlist allows players to compete Hardpoint, Kill Confirmed, and Search and Destroy as the game's iconic Specialists operators, such as Ruin, Seraph, Battery, and Prophet. Each Specialist comes equipped with a unique loadout and operator skill. The mode features eight different Specialist operators, with four of them available right away and another four unlocked through progression.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4479941-codm-s4-announce-002.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4479941" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4479941-codm-s4-announce-002.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4479941"></a><figcaption>New Chase map</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4479941-codm-s4-announce-002.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Season 4 adds a new map to the competitive Chase mode. This map features a winter aesthetic and gives players new obstacles to overcome. The mode also adds a jetpack functionality to enhance player movement for the obstacle course.</p><p dir="ltr">On the battle royale side, Season 4 brings an updated Arena 2.0 mode. This arena's format is single round elimination, and there are no fixed respawn points. In place of the shop, players will instead acquire drops that trigger character upgrades. Weapons will also improve as attachments unlock throughout the match. The developer says the new changes are designed to "simplify the ruleset for a more kinetic battle royale experience."</p><p dir="ltr">The new Tactical Bouncer class is added to battle royale. This new class lets players place jump pads on the ground that will launch operators, throwables, vehicles, and more. All players can interact with these jump pads, and they can also be destroyed.</p><p dir="ltr">The season's new event is called Seven Deadly Sins: Knight's Path. This event tasks players with recruiting knights from the Seven Deadly Sins by completing in-game challenges. Event rewards include the Darkwave operator skin and weapon blueprint for the MG42 light machine gun.</p><p dir="ltr">Players can also expect quality-of-life improvements with Season 4, as well as new seasonal challenges, store bundles, Keep updates, and more.</p><p dir="ltr">In other Call of Duty news, Black Ops 6 and Warzone are currently in Season 3. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/legendary-stoners-jay-silent-bob-are-now-in-call-of-duty-with-these-wacky-items/1100-6530786/">Jay and Silent Bob operator bundles</a> were recently added to the shop, and there's an ongoing <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/how-to-unlock-the-nail-gun-and-all-tribute-event-rewards-in-black-ops-6-and-warzone/2900-6486/">Black Ops Tribute event</a> filled with cosmetic rewards themed around the series.</p>

"Regional Pricing offers users prices that are more reflective of their local economy, rather than paying the same price regardless of where they are," the company said in its announcement. "For example, without Regional Pricing, users in Vietnam or Brazil would pay the same price as users in the United States to access an experience’s economy."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"With Regional Pricing enabled, prices are automatically optimized for each user’s local economy and updated periodically as Roblox’s virtual economy—and the global economy in the physical world—shifts."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The invocation of Vietnam and Brazil's currencies can help developers calibrate their understanding of why items and experiences may appear to cost "fewer" Robux in other countries. In Brazil, one dollar is worth about 5.8 Brazilian real. These currency differences can make goods priced against the US dollar more expensive in these regions.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/palworld-dev-says-ark-survival-evolved-titanfall-2-and-other-games-invalidate-patent-lawsuit" target="_self" data-discover="true">Palworld dev says Ark: Survival Evolved, Titanfall 2, and other games invalidate patent lawsuit</a></p><p>Image via Roblox Corporation.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In the example shared by Roblox, an item priced at 199 Robux in the United States might cost 139 Robux in Brazil.

"Users using a VPN to access Roblox from a Brazilian IP address would not have access to Brazilian pricing," a </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Roblox</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> spokesperson said. "Users who access Roblox from a VPN will be shown the default (highest) price for in-game items.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Ensuring fairness and preventing misuse are our top priorities for this tool. By using a variety of signals to determine a user’s location, we are mitigating the ability of users to manually update their location to take advantage of lower prices.

He has written news, reviews, and more as a tech journalist since 2020.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Sony has <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/04/21/playstation-5-pro-teardown-an-inside-look-at-the-most-advanced-playstation-console-to-date/">published a new teardown</a> of the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/626952/sony-fsr-4-upscaler-coming-to-ps5-pro-reimplementation">PlayStation 5 Pro</a>, highlighting improvements that it made to the cooling apparatus of the machine. They include tweaks to the PS5’s liquid metal cooling design aimed to give the console “more stable” cooling. </p><p>The changes follow unproven claims that the liquid metal used in the first PS5 can leak and damage the console. Some sites even recommended against keeping the PS5 vertical after a repair shop owner and YouTuber was <a href="https://wololo.net/2023/01/05/youre-killing-your-ps5-by-using-it-vertically-due-to-a-design-flaw-by-sony-according-to-hardware-experts/">partially misquoted</a> by jailbreak site Wololo.net. Wololo <a href="https://wololo.net/2023/01/07/ps5-liquid-metal-issues-thecod3r-addresses-some-questions-in-new-video/">later followed up</a>, saying its original story contained a “critical misunderstanding” — ultimately, it doesn’t seem like this was ever a widespread issue.</p><p>Even so, Sony writes that it changed the design for the PS5 Pro, quoting Shinya Tsuchida, PS5 Pro Mechanical Design Lead:</p><div><blockquote><p>We spent quite some time conducting research on insulation when we were designing the original PS5. The basic structure remains the same in the PS5 Pro, but we made some improvements by adding fine grooves where the liquid metal is applied, so that the cooling effect is more stable. When we were doing research for the original PS5, we anticipated that semiconductors would continue to advance and become much denser, so we believed liquid metal technology would become crucial. It turns out we were right, and it was integral when designing the PS5 Pro.</p></blockquote></div><p>The rest of the blog post and its images may be familiar to you if you already saw <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/News/105278/ps5-pro-teardown-is-a-battery-hatch-this-years-hottest-repair-trend">iFixit’s teardown</a> of Sony’s very expensive console, in which it noted that the inside of the PS5 Pro contains more thermal management than electronics.</p><p>Some of that includes a larger cooling fan that the company says has redesigned fan blades, including “smaller blades in between” them. The blog also explains why it’s so hard to see the traces on the PS5 Pro’s motherboard: the board hides extra electrical layers beneath, to speed up memory access.</p></div></div><div><form><div><h2>Installer</h2><p><span>A weekly newsletter by David Pierce designed to tell you everything you need to download, watch, read, listen to, and explore that fits in The Verge’s universe.</span></p></div></form></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/guards-of-traitors-toll-and-busy-streets-expansion-review<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Listen, constable, it all might look straightforward here, but everyone's got an angle. That street vendor has an angle, that shifty looking fellow over there almost certainly has an angle, our patron has an angle, the assessors have an angle, I've got an angle and I'm sure you have an angle for being here too, but that doesn't mean we don't do our duty, and the better you do your duty, the better I'm rewarded and as a result, the better you're rewarded too. Now keep your eye open, that shifty fellow has disappeared into the crowd, we've got work to do. Welcome to Traitor's Toll.</em></p>

<p>When I first saw <em>Guards of Traitor's Toll,</em> I thought it looked like a beautiful cross between <em>Mordheim</em> and the <em>Guards Guards</em> novels from the <em>Discworld</em> setting by Terry Pratchett, and after Grey for Now Games' previous work, I knew it was almost certainly going to be an incredible game. In this article, we're going to check out the <em>Guards of Traitor's Toll</em> Starter Set and the first expansion, Busy Streets. We'll take a look at how it plays and what the 2 sets contain.</p>

<p>We're just starting our <em>Guards of Traitor's Toll</em> coverage here at TechRaptor, but we've been fans of Grey for Now Games and Graham Davey's work since we first tried <em>Test of Honour</em> under Warlord Games, and then the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/test-of-honour-2nd-edition-gaming-set-review" rel="nofollow">2nd Edition</a> when Graham took it under his own company.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/guards-of-traitors-toll-2.jpg?itok=uXJTL5By 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/guards-of-traitors-toll-2.jpg?itok=qSDXS7Uq 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The bustling city of Traitor's Toll from the&nbsp;<em>Guards of Traitor's Toll</em> rulebook.</figcaption></figure><h2>You Have To Pay The Toll</h2>

<p><em>Guards of Traitor's Toll</em> is set in a fantasy setting in the city of Traitor's Toll, an independent city blocking a mountain pass that connects 2 Kingdoms. The city built up over time on the riches of the tolls paid by those wishing to use the pass to the point where now, an entire ecosystem supports the collection of those taxes. The Baron oversees all of it, supported by his Lord and Lady sons and daughters, who each control a different element of the city, and the guards they have to enforce it.</p>

<p>That's where you come in. You are a Guard Captain looking after a shift of guard constables in support of one of Baron's children. Keep the peace, ensure the taxes are collected, and maybe make a bit of extra coin for yourself while you're there.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/guards-of-traitors-toll-5.jpg?itok=vhd08qXT 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/guards-of-traitors-toll-5.jpg?itok=wKbrkDzc 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Guards of Traitor's Toll</em> uses custom dice and tokens to randomise the turn, which combine to make the city feel alive.</figcaption></figure><h2>Take To The Streets</h2>

<p>Games of <em>Guards of Traitor's Toll</em> aren't your usual skirmish wargames, and there's a lot of randomness and unexpected actions from the citizens of the city, with your team of guards trying their best to keep control. Each turn, tokens are drawn from a pot to determine who acts. These tokens are a mix of guard tokens (where the player drawing the token can act with their guards, plot tokens, which have random events, suspect tokens, where criminals take actions, and time tokens, which activates a couple of random citizens and ends the turn if the last time token is drawn.</p>

<p>Games start with no suspects on the board, and guards and citizens can mill about until a plot card is drawn. Plot cards are a mix of random events and criminals appearing, which the guards have to deal with, or risk rising discontent. Completing plot cards earns gold, and the player with the most gold at the end wins. It's never going to be as simple as that, though, and any remaining discontent is taken away from your gold. Discontent comes in 2 forms, general, which affects all players and stays on plot cards until they're completed, and personal, which your own guard unit acquires by being too rough with the local populace, like knocking civilians over, or killing non-deadly suspects.</p>

<p><em>Guards of Traitor's Toll</em> is a semi-cooperative game, and while you can't attack the guards of the other players, you don't have to help them, and it's the guard who completes the plot card who gains the rewards, so be carful of other player's guards lurking nearby as you escort suspects. When a time counter is drawn, 2 citizens move randomly depending on the direction indicated by the dice, and you can use this movement to benefit you, or get in the way of other guards.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/guards-of-traitors-toll-6.jpg?itok=Ofn2PDUa 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/guards-of-traitors-toll-6.jpg?itok=S9VXp0gG 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Plot and secret cards, along with a randomized way of determining the suspect from the cityfolk will keep you on your toes in&nbsp;<em>Guards of Traitor's Toll</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>This random direction also affects your guards, and when the custom dice are rolled, you get a choice of moving in the direction of any swords shown on the dice, and you move 4 inches plus 1 for each foot result rolled. Guards have 2 other movement options, and can move cautiously, which is still in a random direction, but less distance, and they remain alert in case they are attacked, or can take a close action, where they select a specific suspect within targettting range (unless they're sneaking, when you have to spot them first) and move in their direction and interact with them, attacking or subduing afterwards.</p>

<p>This mechanic really controls the game and adds a huge element of realism. If civilians and guards could move freely, whenever a suspect was revealed, every guard would head straight towards them. With this random movement, it captures the chaos of the busy streets of the city, where guards won't always hear every shout, won't be able to spot every pick-pocket (who are doing their best not to be seen), until the guard spots something odd within their target range, and then the chase is on. It gives a living, breathing feeling to the world as you try to best position your guards amongst the populace, because you never know who's trying to avoid paying a tax.</p>

<p><em>Guards of Traitor's Toll</em> is designed as a narrative adventure campaign; there's an ongoing narrative to the plot cards and missions in the book, and you can watch your guards develop over the campaign.</p>

<p>The <em>Guards of Traitor's Toll</em> Starter Set includes everything that 2 players need to play their first few games. This includes:</p>

<ul><li><em>Guards of Traitor's Toll</em>&nbsp;rulebook</li>
	<li>Custom dice</li>
	<li>Plot and secret cards</li>
	<li>Recruitment, trait, and advance cards for guards for 2 players</li>
	<li>12 guard miniatures</li>
	<li>24 cityfolk miniatures</li>

There are 6 types of cityfolk on the identify card (which is used when randomly determining a citizen), and each type has 5 features to help with randomising, so it's a good idea to build a spread of these. Plot cards also have a feature used to determine a suspect (barefeet, performer, etc), and Grey for Now Games has a <a href="https://greyfornow.com/en-us/products/guards-of-traitors-toll-plastics-assembly-guide" rel="nofollow">handy file</a> where you can see the sprues in full detail for planning your builds.</p>

<p>The <em>Guards of Traitor's Toll</em>&nbsp;Busy Street expansion is the easiest way to expand your games to 3 or 4 players. It includes:</p>

<ul><li>12 additional cityfolk miniatures</li>
	<li>12 guard miniatures (which gives all players 6 guards when combined with the starter set)</li>
	<li>Recruitment cards (as with the starter set, but with 2 new guard crests for 3 or 4 player games)</li>
	<li>New Guard Sergeant cards with 4 different crests</li>
	<li>6 new trait cards and 13 advance&nbsp;cards (11 new, 2 repeated)</li>
	<li>New secret and plot cards</li>
	<li>Injury cards (handily printed versions from the rules)</li>
	<li>New Patron cards</li>
	<li>An additional set of custom dice and a token sheet</li>
</ul><figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/guards-of-traitors-toll-8.jpg?itok=VUaDlh_2 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/guards-of-traitors-toll-8.jpg?itok=Jhs4rJ33 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The&nbsp;<em>Guards of Traitor's Toll </em>Busy Streets expansion adds new patron cards and a new guard type, along with enough components for 3 or 4 player games.</figcaption></figure><p>Even if you're not looking to expand to 3 or 4 player games, the extra citizens and guards are handy to have for variety, and the additional card content adds a lot to games. The Patron cards especially add an interesting new element, and each of the 4 patrons has 4 cards, of which you randomly draw 3 each game. These patron cards grant additional gold at the end of the game if you complete certain objectives, playing in a way that represents your patron. This makes the guard units feel more unique and reflects the variety between the different patrons they serve.</p>

<p>At the moment, for a solo player the extra content feels locked behind the miniatures, and in the future, there might be a way to purchase all of the rules/cards/dice/tokens without any miniatures (as the system is fairly miniatures agnostic), but the extra variety gained with the Busy Streets expansion does make it worthwhile. It feels like you can pick up the Starter Set, decide if it's for you, and then buy into the Busy Streets expansion to expand your games further, opening up the extra variety and additional rules.</p>

<h2>Guards of Traitor's Toll and Busy Streets Final Thoughts?</h2>

<p>I'm a huge fan of <em>Guards of Traitor's Toll</em>. The token system for activation, which can be a bit random in <em>Test of Honour</em> (and other Warlord Games systems) when looking for a competitive battle, suits this perfectly, with the random movement capturing the feel of a bustling city perfectly. The advance and trait cards start to bring to life your constables, and the citizens themselves start to develop their own stories within your game. The Busy Streets expansion, while appearing for solo players to lock content behind a miniatures purchase, adds a lot of variety to games, and the extra citizens and guards aren't wasted. For 3 or 4-player games, Busy Streets is essential.</p>

<p><em>Guards of Traitor's Toll</em> plays well at all player counts, and always feels natural, rather than solo rules being bolted on. Exploring the narrative through the plot and secret cards, as well as watching your guards develop and rivalries grow if playing with 2 or more players, is a true joy. It perfectly captures the feel of a skirmish and adventure game, in a living environment, where the civilians and suspects' AI control feels random and realistic.</p>

I wouldn’t blame you for thinking that sounds like a hassle, but the mantle’s second stage makes it worth it..</p><p><strong>Repeatedly landing attacks with the Corrupted Mantle equipped will further increase your affinity by another five-percent, increase your attack power by five-percent, and remove the health-reducing debuff.</strong> That means you can enjoy all the buffs without the penalty, but you’ll have to work for it. While it’s unfortunate that the in-game description doesn’t provide proper stats or an explanation of the weapon enhancements, not mentioning that the sole debuff can be removed by landing attacks is tantamount to misinformation. Being able to remove that single flaw is what makes this such a great item.</p><p>The Corrupted Mantle admittedly isn’t as strong as it was in previous <em>Monster Hunter </em>games. You used to receive a 30-percent Affinity increase and a 10-percent attack power increase before the update. It even lasted an extra 30 seconds on top of all that. Still, even with the nerfs and the new minute-and-a-half duration, you can shave off a lot of health from whatever beast you’re hunting.

Thankfully, it doesn’t take that many attacks to trigger the second stage. Keep in mind that activating it when face-to-face with a monster might not work out if they’re able to hit you or if they start leaving the area. I instead suggest using it during the following situations:</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Before starting a hunt with a sneak attack</li><li>Right before <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-wounds-hunter-mode-solo-co-op-1851771276&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-wounds-hunter-mode-solo-co-op-1851771276">destroying a wound</a></span> with a focus strike</li><li>When a monster falls into a trap</li><li>When a monster is knocked down</li></ul><p>All of these situations will provide you with plenty of time to bring out the full power of the Corrupted Mantle. If you want to maximize your damage further, try to time your usage soon after the monster migrates to a new area. The last thing you want is to waste away the potential for big damage by chasing after a flying Rathalos.</p><hr><p>Mantles are meant to be powerful assets that come at the cost of long recharge times. Even with that and the initial health-reducing debuff, the Corrupted Mantle is a formidable option. I wholeheartedly recommend trying it out and having some fun while you challenge the toughest monsters you can.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/kowloon-generic-romance-is-the-closest-anime-has-come-to-a-wong-kar-wai-film.1169655/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/kowloon-generic-romance<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I won’t be the last person to say that Wong Kar Wai’s cinema is good kino, seamlessly transforming the ethereal essence of raw, intangible emotions into a vivid, dreamlike work of art. From the tender ache of <em>In the Mood for Love</em> to the bittersweet unraveling of profoundly connected yet deeply lonely lovers in <em>Happy Together</em> to the existential echoes of lost love in <em>2046</em>, his films perform a kind of cinematic alchemy, unpacking the emotional weight of love and loss. Neon-drenched cityscapes become poetic reflections of yearning that feel both eternal and fleeting, captured through his hypnotic, slow-motion lens. In the words of Nicole Kidman, “Heartbreak feels good in a place likе this.”&nbsp;</p><p><em>Kowloon Generic Romance</em>, a new anime this season, hums to a similar cadence as Kar Wai’s works, blending love, mystery, and nostalgia into its atmospheric tale set in the worn-down <a href="https://aftermath.site/kowloon-walled-city-cross-section-illustrated" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">labyrinthine walled city</a>, in what might just be the closest anime has come to evoking the legendary cinematographer’s films.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Kowloon Generic Romance</em> is part mystery, part sci-fi, and all parts romance. Written and illustrated by <em>After the Rain</em> mangaka Jun Mayuzuki, it follows Reiko Kujirai and Hajime Kudo, two coworkers at Wang Lai Realty Company, whose office banter flirts with something more profound. As the name of the show bluntly suggests, their dynamic ticks all the familiar romcom boxes—lunch break debates over trying out new spots over old haunts; teasing that borders on being mean, like kids on a playground—but beneath the surface, something is off, hinting at a deeper mystery at play.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Spoilers for that.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Kujirai and Kudo’s conversations are drenched in nostalgia, from their musings on Kowloon’s inherent charm to the way memory and love intertwine for people inside the town. When Kujirai offhandedly mentions how watermelon tastes better with a cigarette—a line that feels right at home in a Wong Kar Wai work—Kudo hesitates before saying that habit reminds him of someone he once knew. That lingering theme of familiarity resurfaces again when a waiter mistakes Kujirai for Kudo’s girlfriend. Kudo, to Kujirai’s surprise, brushes her off when she wonders if it’d be awkward if he returned with his actual girlfriend, but adds, “That’s not something you should worry about.” By now, Spidey senses are tingling something fierce.&nbsp;</p><p>Their nostalgia talk moves on to romantic dialogue tree territory when Kujirai admits their hangouts feel strangely familiar, leading to a rooftop moment that would belong in the season finale of any other romance anime. Just when it looks like they might kiss in the first episode, speedrunning past the lewd handholding stage, Kudo deflects once again, teasing Kujirai about her crow’s feet. They do wind up kissing at the close of the first episode, but it's anything but generic. In a quiet office moment, Kujirai wakes Kudo with playful prodding, and in that drowsy haze, he kisses her—like full-on French kisses her like a husband and wife on the morning of their honeymoon—only to shove her away, say my bad, and leave with a cryptic “wrong person.” It's here where the anime’s mystery crystallizes when Kujirai finds a Polaroid of them together in his drawer—except she has no memory of it or their apparent engagement.</p><figure><figure><figcaption><span>Arvo Animation</span></figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><span>Arvo Animation</span></figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><span>Arvo Animation</span></figcaption></figure><figure><figcaption><span>Arvo Animation</span></figcaption></figure><span><figure></figure></span></figure><p>From here on, Kujirai grapples with feelings for Hajime that are undeniably hers, despite having no memory of the past they shared. Elsewhere, Kudo struggles with maintaining a healthy distance between them, which doesn’t help her romantic confusion. At the same time, the show cuts back to his meet-cute with a pre-amnesia version of Kujirai. Contrary to her current, bashful self, pre-amnesia Kujirai was a confident, captivating presence, putting Hajime on the romantic back foot as he wistfully yearned for her. Despite their current circumstance, Kudo doesn’t display any signs of wanting to recreate their old dynamic. Whenever things look like they’re about to heat up, he reliably breaks the tension with jokes, keeping their connection at a cautious platonic distance. However, his emotions slip when Kujirai cosplays as her former self, which only pisses him off instead of making sparks fly between them again. While the mystery of their amnesia storyline unfolds in the foreground of the anime, with both sides aware of the elephant in the room without outwardly addressing it to each other, the anime delves deeply into the weight of nostalgia.&nbsp;</p><p>Beneath the romance lies a sweeping sci-fi narrative, exploring humanity’s pursuit of innovation at the expense of its essence. Hebinuma, a pharmaceutical giant, is pulling an <em>Altered Carbon</em> advertising "eternal youth and immortality" by backing up memories for Generic Terra—a still-unfinished, gaudy <a href="https://evangelion.fandom.com/wiki/Ramiel" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ramiel-looking polyhedron</a> floating above Earth. Government-funded and branded as a "romance for humankind," it's the latest in a trend of future-flung conspiratorial pharmaceutical shows that posits the pros and cons of creating a fake Earth with fake people, set in a future that echoes a vanished past. Combine the fact that folks’ tax dollars are funding the knockoff Earth populated by backup versions of people, with the show being set in a futuristic version of a setting that no longer exists, and you’ve got the pretty nifty adult romance anime on your hands.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Kowloon Generic Romance Anime and Live Action Movie - Official Trailer" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JhLqN5mYXDI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><div><p>However, there is a caveat to recommending the show to those hoping to dive into it via the anime: the manga isn’t done yet, and the anime aims to cover the entire series. This has manga readers, myself included, <a href="https://www.cbr.com/kowloon-generic-romance-manga-end/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">side-eying the anime</a>, hoping it doesn’t fumble the bag with a rushed original anime ending to coalesce with its annoyingly fast pacing.</p><p>So far, that has materialized in the show condensing each volume of the manga into 25-minute episodes. While it hasn't reached the level of car wreck anime adaptations of otherwise phenomenal manga, like <em>The Promised Neverland</em>’s second season where entire arcs were skipped in a blitz toward its finale, <em>Kowloon Generic Romance</em>’s trimmed-for-brevity approach to adapting the series into an anime does dampen the deliberate, atmospheric pacing that defined it. Apparently, viewers are meant to watch the <a href="https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2024-10-10/kowloon-generic-romance-manga-gets-tv-anime-live-action-film-in-2025/.216593#:~:text=Shueisha%20announced%20on%20Friday%20that,and%20footage%20for%20both%20projects." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">anime and then the live-action</a> show to get a whole mixed-media experience with its adaptation, so I’ll hold my reservations on whether the show sticks that landing or not. Regardless, we’ll always have the manga, now <a href="https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2025-04-15/jun-mayuzuki-kowloon-generic-romance-manga-is-in-final-arc/.223585" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">nearing its end</a>, which makes it the perfect time to dive into <em>Kowloon Generic Romance</em> and soak in its magical realism and unmistakable Wong Kar Wai vibes.</p></div></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/star-wars-zero-company-permadeath-xcom"><h3>Fine, I’ll Play Star Wars XCOM</h3></a><p>It's got permadeath, and that's enough for me</p></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p>New studio Intima Leaf, founded by developers Aymen Menjli and Mehdi Baccouche, has announced its first game called Riven Crown. It has been described as a mix of a Soulslike and a fighting game, with Intima Leaf giving the game the description of a Souls Fighter. Before we get into that you can check out the announcement trailer below.</p>
<p><iframe title="Riven Crown Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vuBDe3LzIL8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Now, back to the phrase “Souls Fighter”. The main element of Riven Crown’s gameplay is that of a soulslike title, an action RPG with tough enemies to face. However, where Riven Crown differs is with its combat and combo system. Each weapon in Riven Crown has its own library of combos to learn and master, and putting those combos together to build up a meter to enter a Super State. In this state, combat becomes fast paces and the dodge roll is replaced with a swift dodge. The super combos will require to master both input sequences and timings to pull off each weapon’s combos. Along with attacks, players will also have to master both the standing and crouching block systems. Mistime a block and enemies will have an opening to strike.</p>
<div id="8PYG5hiaXy1NfZ7bgFuvm-content-0" tabindex="0" role="article" data-tabster="{&quot;groupper&quot;:{&quot;tabbability&quot;:2},&quot;focusable&quot;:{}}" data-content="ai-message" aria-labelledby="8PYG5hiaXy1NfZ7bgFuvm-author} 8PYG5hiaXy1NfZ7bgFuvm-content-0">
<p>Riven Crown tells the tale of a fallen hero who awakens in a mysterious new dimension, where four ancient civilizations stand, but they have been tainted by corruption. Kings and Queens ruled these civilisations but have succumbed to darkness, becoming demons known as the Deep Samum. Those who lived in these civilisations have become victims of the corruption and have turned into hell beasts that will attack the player.&nbsp; A separate faction of humans has also emerged in this chaos and it is governed by a Council of Elders. This council use dark magic to create the Bark Aggregation, an element that grants humans superpowers.</p>

</div>
<p>Riven Crown is said to last between 25 to 35 hours, with plenty to explore across the corrupted civilisations and plenty of fights to get into. The experience of Riven Crown will not just be limited to the game either. Intima Leaf has stated it will be running a cipher minigame with weekly challenges being presented, and real life prizes being put up for grabs. If you go to the <a href="https://rivencrown.com/">official Riven Crown website</a>, you can sign up to the newsletter and be notified of when the beta will be going live.</p>
