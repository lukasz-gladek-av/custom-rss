		<p>The rhythm-loving armies of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/patapon">Patapon</a> are marching forth again, as Patapon 1+2 Replay will remaster the PSP classics for Nintendo Switch, PS5 and PC on 11th July.</p>
<p><iframe title="PATAPON 1+2 REPLAY – Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ojtnxA61V6Q?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>This is great news for fans of the cult classic rhythm-action games, but there’s a twist. This pair of PlayStation Portable classics are being published on Switch, not by Sony, but by Bandai Namco instead. The new remasters are being developed by SAS Co. Ltd, who I cannot find any details about.</p>
<p>Combining the first two Patapon games into one bundle (though sadly not Patapon 3), you’re cast as a god looking down on the silhouetted tribe of the Patapon. Having been driven from their home by the Zigoton, you will take control and help guide them back to their rightful place by beating a war drum in certain rhythms to command your troops, telling them to march forward, attack, defend and more. Combine that with unlocking and commanding different units, and you’ll have to overcome monsters in the wild, assault Zigoton fortresses and more. Sticking to the beat with your button presses consistently enough, and your army will enter a FEVER! and boost their fervent abilities.</p>
<p>New for this remastered collection are some difficulty settings – Normal, Easy and Hard – adjustments for button timing to help with input lag, and a constant command display, so you don’t have to remember the specific commands.</p>

<p>Originally developed by Japan Studio – <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/02/25/report-playstations-japan-studio-is-being-wound-down-but-astros-playroom-developer-asobi-team-will-survive/">which Sony shut down in the last couple years</a> – the games were a pretty much essential part of the PSP library. Sony revisited the games with a remaster of the original in 2017 and the sequel in 2020, both for PS4, but the game’s natural home really is on a handheld, if you ask me.</p>
<p>“As special as it was ten years ago,” Dom said in <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2017/08/07/patapon-remastered-review/">our 2017 review</a>, “Patapon Remastered is a glorious example of when art, music and gameplay coalesce into something far more intoxicating than its sum parts would have you expect.”</p>
<p>Here’s hoping this Replay bundle gives <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/02/05/patapon-2-remastered-review/">the second game a little more love and attention</a>, though.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Patapon fans might like to revisit the early games, but if you want something actually new, the original creators are working on <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/11/16/patapons-legacy-will-continue-when-ratatan-arrives-in-2025/">Ratatan</a>, which is also due out later this year.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nintendo-switch-2-pre-orders-go-live-on-april-2nd-according-to-best-buy.1146735/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/03/27/nintendo-switch-2-pre-orders-april-2nd-best-buy/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>A hastily deleted <a href="https://blog.bestbuy.ca/video-games/nintendo-switch-2-announced-launching-in-2025">blog post</a> by Best Buy Canada has stated that pre-orders for the Nintendo Switch 2 console will go live on April 2nd 2025, a date that was tipped by various punters a few days ago. Nintendo have not officially announced anything and as the post was removed rather quickly it does suggest that Best Buy announced things a little too early.&nbsp; However, the date is the same as next week’s Switch 2 Direct so put on your surprised face when they announce it during the show.</p>
<p><iframe title="Nintendo Switch 2 – First-look trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WxLUf2kRQRE?start=1&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The teaser trailer is pretty abstract, showing lots of comparison bits and bobs for how the console has changed in comparison to the original Switch. It’s all black, for one thing, with just a pop of neon blue and neon red on the inner cap of the analogue sti cks, but all-black Joy-Con. It shows the added USB-C port on the top of the console alongside the bottom, the new kick stand design that runs the full width, the enlarged Joy-Con with new magnetic snap attachment mechanism, and with a mysterious new button on the right Joy-Con. The console shares the same hybrid approach as the original Switch with detachable Joy-Con for docked or tabletop play.</p>
<p>The one game teased during this video was Mario Kart 9.</p>

<p>Nintendo reconfirmed that it will have backward compatibility to Nintendo Switch games, both digital and cartridge. Some games might not be fully compatible or supported on Switch 2 with more details coming at a later date.</p>
<div>
<p>There’s been leaks about the console’s hardware specs, revealing the Nvidia chipset that is set to replace the Tegra X1 within the original Switch to be a modified Tegra T239. There’s also been <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4R1p1LjHME8">a big discussion over Nintendo’s upscaling patent</a>, suggestions about&nbsp;<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Switch/comments/1hx0wge/switch_2_skus_found_in_system_today/">the use of MicroSD Express for SSD-like read speeds</a>, and just last week at CES, accessories manufacturer&nbsp;<a href="https://x.com/Numerama/status/1876817276143378586">Genki rocked up to the show with a full suite of bits and bobs for the new console</a>, even&nbsp;<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-breaks-silence-on-this-weeks-switch-2-leaks">prompting Nintendo’s lawyers to visit, </a>though Genki state they’ve never signed an NDA or actually seen an official Switch 2.</p>
</div>
<p>Currently, the console does not have a release date but we would assume that if they are going to start taking pre-orders, the release date will be announced at the same time.</p>

		<p>Super Rare Originals and developer Pixel Reign have announced Moros Protocol, a retro-styled sci-fi FPS roguelite that will be coming to PC later this year.</p>
<p><iframe title="Moros Protocol | Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/As49-2YisCY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Waking up aboard a battleship heading to war, you quickly discover that the ship has been taken over by monsters that have killed pretty much all the crew. With your AI companion Ody-6, you have to try time and again to fight back those beasts and save the ship.</p>
<p>What immediately stands out about the game is the visual style. There’s some common ground with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/05/29/system-shock-remake-review/">the System Shock remake</a> or <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/05/23/warhammer-40k-boltgun-review/">Warhammer 40,000: Boltgun</a> in that the world is rendered in 3D, but a retro aesthetic is applied by having heavily pixellated textures. Combined with some hefty neon glow and bloom, and it’s an aesthetic that still stands out. It’s built on a custom renderer to really capture the desired look.</p>


<p>As a roguelite that’s inspired by the speed of classic shooters, there’s plenty of weapons in the game, from SMGs and pistols through to swords and flamethrowers, and you’ll often be rewarded by opening chests to get new weapons or find augments to boost your particular playstyle.</p>
<p>Each run will offer you the chance to choose your own path through a branching design, either playing it safe to progress, or risk it for a better upgrade or weapon. After each run ends – by death or otherwise – you can upgrade your abilities more permanently to help on future attempts.&nbsp;<b></b></p>
<p>Another nice tweak is that you can get a buddy to join you with support for drop-in co-op for two players.<b></b></p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/as-we-descend-delayed-may</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/post-apocalyptic-deckbuilder-as-we-descend-delayed-until-may.1146729/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/as-we-descend-delayed-may<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Roguelike deckbuilder&nbsp;<em>As We Descend&nbsp;</em>has been delayed until May, but a concrete release date for the game has been revealed, so it won't be too much longer until you get to play it.</p>

<p>Back in February, it was announced that&nbsp;<em>As We Descend&nbsp;</em>would <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/as-we-descend-early-access-release-date" rel="nofollow">arrive in Early Access in March</a>, but Kevin Chang, director of developer Box Dragon, says the game needs "a little more time in the oven" before it's ready.</p>

<p>As a sweetener, though, the game's demo, which is currently available on Steam, has been localized into 11 languages, including French, German, and Ukrainian, so more folks around the world can check it out before deciding to make a purchase.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/as-we-descend-delayed-early-access-combat.jpg?itok=kVMREYIL 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/as-we-descend-delayed-early-access-combat.jpg?itok=v-FI3MAM 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Deckbuilder&nbsp;<em>As We Descend&nbsp;</em>is landing a little later than anticipated.</figcaption></figure><p>Chang says Box Dragon has "big plans" for&nbsp;<em>As We Descend</em>, and that now is the "perfect time" to try the game out if you haven't already done so. He goes on to say that the game's Early Access launch is "just the beginning".</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>As We Descend</em>, it's a roguelike deckbuilder set in a post-apocalyptic world "where resources are scarce and monsters threaten humanity’s very existence". Well, it wouldn't be much of a post-apocalyptic world without life-threatening danger.</p>

<p>Gameplay-wise,&nbsp;<em>As We Descend&nbsp;</em>is split between its card-battling combat and its diplomacy systems, which will see you building relationships with key figures in order to stave off crises and make critical alliances.</p>

<p>According to Box Dragon, you can expect&nbsp;<em>As We Descend</em>'s setting to offer a "desperate city that evolves and crumbles in unique ways based on the player’s decisions", so it sounds like you'll need to be careful what you choose during conversations.</p>




<p><em>As We Descend&nbsp;</em>is coming to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1769830/As_We_Descend/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC via Steam Early Access</a> on May 28th, and a demo is available to try out right now if you want to see whether the game is your cup of (presumably poisoned) tea or not.</p>

<p>The First Berserker: Khazan launches today (March 27), and the game’s developers have already nerfed two of the game’s hardest bosses.</p>



<p>In a post on the game’s <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TheFirstBerserker/comments/1jkz6qs/dev_note_on_khazans_official_launch_first_balance/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">subreddit</a>, developer Neople revealed that it has made a number of changes in the form of a launch-day balance patch. Of the numerous changes, the biggest seems to be change in the difficulty of Viper and Maluca.</p>



<p>With the decision to change the difficulties of the bosses, the game’s creative director, Junho Lee, gave context surrounding the motives and what’s being done.</p>



<p>You can read the explanation, in full, below.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Viper has already earned nicknames like “newbie crusher” from many players. While there are several reasons for this balance adjustment, the primary factor was our intentional design choice to present a slightly higher challenge during the difficulty tuning process. However, we realized that this posed an excessive burden on players adapting to the game. Additionally, the extended duration required for immersive combat, although providing a definite sense of accomplishment, led us to question whether it offered an appropriate level of challenge for players reaching Mission 3 for the first time. The answer leaned towards “no.” Despite the possibility for many players to simply give up, you provided us with valuable feedback through various channels. Some mentioned that Viper felt like a “final boss-level challenge,” yet clearing it brought a thrilling satisfaction reminiscent of past experiences, sparking curiosity about “what comes next if the third boss is this challenging.” The required skill level to face Viper was significantly higher than the proficiency players had developed up to that point and the prolonged engagement and the punitive nature of mistakes could have led many to abandon the challenge, yet you chose to share your precious insights with us. Once again, we sincerely thank you for your invaluable feedback.</p>



<p>Regarding Maluca, we have structured Khazan’s storyline into two parts, with Maluca serving as the boss of the first part. While we understand that many of you found this encounter both challenging and enjoyable, we also recognized that it presented a relatively high level of difficulty. Although we cannot disclose exact data, we observed that players new to Khazan found Maluca to be more than twice as challenging as Rangkus, the previous boss and deputy leader of the bandits.</p>



<p>Taking these factors into account, we have slightly reduced the difficulty in the main game. Players can be now rewarded more quickly through stamina-based combat, and we’ve made adjustments to ensure that minor mistakes no longer necessarily lead to failure.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Despite the changes to the difficulty of the two bosses, Lee says that the team has “ensured that the core values of challenge and accomplishment remain intact.” He added both Viper and Mulca will “still present a significant challenge compared to other monsters.”</p>



<p>Other changes in the launch patch include skill balance adjustments for various weapons, buffs to a few other bosses, as well as more benefits for those playing on easy mode.</p>



<p>Lastly, without going into much detail, Lee said that there will be more updates coming to the game “as early as next week” as some have taken more time to implement. He also said there are plans for a free DLC content update to be launched in May.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/03/nintendos-new-system-for-sharing-digital-switch-games-explained/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                      
                      
          <p>Switch players who buy their games on physical cards are used to being able to share those games with other players simply by handing them the card. Now, Nintendo is planning a process to allow players to share their digital Switch purchases in a similar way.</p>
<p>The new "virtual game card" system—which Nintendo <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EWwyh74MXXY">announced today</a> ahead of a planned late April rollout—will allow players to "load" and "eject" digital games via a dedicated management screen. An ejected digital game can't be played on the original console, but it can be digitally loaded onto a new console and played there without restriction by any user logged into that system.</p>
<figure><p><iframe allow="fullscreen" loading="lazy" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EWwyh74MXXY?start=0&amp;wmode=transparent"></iframe></p></figure>
<p>While an Internet connection is required when loading and ejecting digital games in this way, the Internet will not be required to play the shared digital game after that initial process is complete. And while both Switch consoles will need to be synced up via a "local connection" the first time such sharing is done, subsequent shares won't require the consoles to be in physical proximity.</p>
<p>Nintendo's announcement says this virtual game card system allows players to "freely load and arrange which games you play on <em>up to two systems</em> [emphasis added]," suggesting you won't be able to share different games across more than one secondary console. For households with more than two Switch units, though, Nintendo says virtual game card lending will also be available across your Nintendo Switch "family group" accounts. But these "family" loans are limited to one game at a time (per group member) and only last for two weeks (after which the loan can be manually renewed).</p>

            <p>Witchbrook, the cosy life-sim set in a wizard school from Chucklefish, has finally received a release window eight years after its initial reveal.</p>
<p>Though Project Spellbound, as it was known, was first teased back in 2016, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stardew-valley-publisher-reveals-new-details-on-magic-school-rpg">Witchbrook proper was announced in 2017</a>. It immediately drew comparison with <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/stardew-valley">Stardew Valley</a>, previously published by Chucklefish, and in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stardew-valley-inspired-magic-school-sim-witchbrook-gets-a-gorgeous-new-look">2020 switched to an isometric view</a>.</p>
<p>Beyond a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/chucklefishs-witchbrook-is-still-alive-pretty-new-screenshots-show">look at fresh screenshots in 2022</a>, little has been shown of the game. Until today! During the Nintendo Direct, we finally got a release window of winter 2025 across PC, Nintendo Switch, and Xbox - including a day one Game Pass release.</p>

<p>Witchbrook has players enrol in the titular magical college, able to explore the seaside city of Mossport, the surrounding woodlands, and the college grounds themselves. In fact, four players can explore together in online co-op multiplayer.</p>
<p>Players will be able to learn new magical abilities to support themselves, local businesses and the community, make friends and romance other characters, renovate a cute woodland cottage and its garden, and spend time between classes by foraging, selling crafts, and entering seasonal events.</p>
<p>"Witchbrook is the most exciting project I've ever worked on, and it's been a long time coming, but I'm very eager to get the game in the hands of the players soon," said Chucklefish CTO Rodrigo Braz Monteiro.</p>
<p>"I don't think that the level of simulation and fidelity we've aimed for in this game is expected of any games short of AAA, and to see it realised in a pixel art indie game has been very satisfying to us. For now, we're only sharing a small glimpse into a vast game, and I can't wait for the community to see what's coming over the next few months."</p>
<p>"Witchbrook is our love letter to thoughtful living, the quiet magic of slow moments, and the connections we share with each other and the world around us," added art director Steph Caskenette. "Whether players are exploring solo or sharing in the adventure, we hope Witchbrook becomes a space to relax and make lasting memories."</p>
<p>Witchbrook was shown at today's Nintendo Direct, alongside a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/metroid-prime-4-beyond-will-give-samus-psychic-powers">first look at Metroid Prime 4: Beyond gameplay</a>, a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-legends-z-a-has-a-battle-royale-mode-that-finally-explains-what-its-name-means">new look at Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a>, and a new <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/theres-still-a-switch-game-coming-out-in-2026">Tomodachi Life game due in 2026</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p>ustwo Games has announced that it will be released Monument Valley 3 on PC and consoles this summer, following on from its brief exclusivity on Netflix. The game was released back in December for the streaming service, and now the studio is looking to reach more players as it comes to PC via Steam, Xbox Series X|S, PS5, PS4, and Nintendo Switch. Additionally, the original Monument Valley and Monument Valley 2 will be released on April 15th for PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X|S, and Switch.</p>
<p><iframe title="Monument Valley 3 | Launch Trailer |" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/R0BGVxbWmHE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/07/31/ustwo-games-confirms-monument-valley-3-is-now-in-development/">Monument Valley 3 was first announced</a> way back in 2019, so it did take five years to get to release. In this third game, players are Noor. Noor is on a mission to find a light source to push back the darkness that is enclosing her world. Like the previous games, players will have to manipulate the environment to find the solutions to the puzzles with each chapter adding a new spin to things. In a first for the series, Monument Valley 3 lets you set sail in open areas to further explore the world. Post launch, ustwo games has confirmed there will be new puzzles and chapters added to the game.</p>
<p>Anyone who purchases Monument Valley 3 will also be donating to charity, as ustwo games has stated the 3% of profits to Flood Relief.</p>

		<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/chucklefish">Chucklefish</a> and co-developer Robotality have revealed their first proper look at their magical life-sim Witchbrook, confirming that the game will be coming to PC, Nintendo Switch and Xbox this winter. It will be day one in<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/xbox-game-pass"> Xbox Game Pass</a>.</p>
<p><iframe title="Witchbrook - First Look Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TIKSGazNOqg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The game will let you enrol in Witchbrook College near the seaside city of Mossport, sinking into a world where you can simply pull out your magic wand and clean up messes and broken plumbing, or hop onto your broomstick and fly over the rooftops. The trailer also showing little snippets of home decoration and fishing. Truth be told, it doesn’t really show too much about what the game will actually play like, though it’s sure to lean on established genre tropes in some areas.</p>
<p>The game is playable with up to four players exploring the sandbox in co-op multipayer, and honestly, the pixelart visual style is stunning. Every scene in the trailer is packed with people and detail from an isometric view.</p>
<p>Technical Director Rodrigo Braz Monteiro said of his the game, “Witchbrook is the most exciting project I’ve ever worked on, and it’s been a long time coming, but I’m very eager to get the game in the hands of the players soon. I don’t think that the level of simulation and fidelity we’ve aimed for in this game is expected of any games short of AAA, and to see it realised in a pixel art indie game has been very satisfying to us. For now, we’re only sharing a small glimpse into a vast game, and I can’t wait for the community to see what’s coming over the next few months.”</p>

<p>Elsewhere, producer Rosie Ball explained that the team has embraced a 4-day work week and no-crunch approach to getting the game made, which is always great to hear.</p>
<p>This is the first meaningful look at Witchbrook, but you might remember the game from its original announcements. First teased as Project Spellbound in 2017, with Chucklefish looking to ride the wave of Stardew Valley interest (for which they provided porting support for the console versions), it was then named as Witchbrook a year later in 2018. At that time, the concept artwork and screenshots showed the game with that face-on view familiar to many pixel art life sims. In the intervening time, the game has clearly jumped 45º to give an isometric viewpoint, which feels much more distinct.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/v-rising-11-update-release-date<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Stunlock Studios has revealed the release date for&nbsp;<em>V Rising&nbsp;</em>Update 1.1, which will serve as the vampire survival game's first major update since its 1.0 release.</p>

<p>The developer first promised a big new update for the game back in January, when&nbsp;<em>V Rising&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/v-rising-sales-top-5-million" rel="nofollow">crossed five million sales</a>. Now, that update, named "Invaders of Oakveil", has a release date: April 28th.</p>

<p>Invaders of Oakveil's first major addition to&nbsp;<em>V Rising&nbsp;</em>is the eponymous Oakveil Woodlands, a new biome filled with "deadly enemies, new bosses, and dark magic techniques" for you to discover. As the name suggests, it's a forest biome.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/v-rising-update-1.1-invaders-of-oakveil.jpg?itok=2LPD8amB 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/v-rising-update-1.1-invaders-of-oakveil.jpg?itok=snKXy4JZ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>V Rising</em>'s 1.1 update is coming in April.</figcaption></figure><p>It's not just the new biome, though. Update 1.1 will also bring the ability to build custom duel arenas within your castle, then challenge your friends (or anyone you like) to a duel. Don't worry, though; duels won't have any consequences, so you can fight to your heart's content.</p>

<p>Three new weapons will be added in the form of the Claws, the Twinblade, and the Throwing Daggers, each of which, Stunlock says, will unlock "fresh combat strategies and unique playstyles". They'll be accompanied by seven new spells for you to test out.</p>

<p>You can also look forward to&nbsp;<em>V Rising</em>'s "biggest combat overhaul yet", which the developer says will bring "a deep stat rework, rebalanced gear, completely overhauled blood types, and powerful new customization tools".</p>

<p>All of this and more will be introduced as part of Invaders of Oakveil, and you can watch the debut trailer for the update (which admittedly doesn't give a whole lot away) right here.</p>




<p><em>V Rising&nbsp;</em>is an open-world survival game in which you play the vampiric lord of a castle. You must sally forth into the mortal world to collect resources, do battle with powerful rivals, and establish your dominion as a lord.</p>

<p>The game is available right now for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1604030/V_Rising/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a> and <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/v-rising/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and its Invaders of Oakveil update lands on April 28th.</p>

This had me looking at prices for its predecessor, the still-very-fast 990 Pro, and I was happy to see that its 4TB model is currently selling for $279.99 at <a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FSAMSUNG-990-PRO-M-2-2280-4TB-PCI-Express-Gen-4-0-x4-NVMe-2-0-V7-V-NAND-3bit-MLC-Internal-Solid-State-Drive-SSD-MZ-V9P4T0B-AM-Non-Heatsink%2F5075942372" rel="sponsored">Walmart</a> and at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0CHGT1KFJ/ref=ewc_pr_img_1?smid=ATVPDKIKX0DER&amp;psc=1&amp;tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">Amazon</a> as part of its <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/634880/amazon-big-spring-sale-march-2025-prime-day-deals-shop">Big Spring Sale</a> — more or less half off the price of the 9100 Pro’s 4 TB version (<a href="https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Computing-Workstations-VAP1T0B-AM/dp/B0DX2GJ1YR?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">$549.99</a>).</p><p>Why buy the 990 Pro over the 9100 Pro? Well, the 9100 Pro requires PCIe Gen 5-ready hardware to take advantage of its speeds, and that tech is far from being affordable or mainstream at the moment.</p><p>As <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/8/24/23319258/samsung-990-pro-ssd-speeds-heatsink-ps5">we wrote</a> when the 990 Pro launched in 2022, that SSD came close to PCIe Gen 4’s theoretical speed limit, making it among the quicker options out there for PC (its faster speed is wasted on the PS5, though it’ll work fine in one). It’s still a great value today, especially as prices for all storage configurations have dropped considerably. Considering that a 2TB version of the 990 Pro is $170 and doubling the storage costs just about $100 more, we think that the 4TB is the one to get right now. As game install sizes continue to increase, it’ll be a great addition to any PS5, or in any desktop or laptop that supports PCIe Gen 4 speeds.</p><p>Given that the 990 Pro we’re recommending doesn’t have a heatsink (one’s suggested for use in the PS5, and it’s never a bad idea on PC), it’s <a rel="sponsored" href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=m2+ssd+heatsink&amp;i=electronics&amp;crid=2C532BVY97UYG&amp;sprefix=m2+ssd+heatsink%2Celectronics%2C107&amp;ref=nb_sb_noss_2&amp;tag=theverge02-20">cheaper to buy and install your own instead</a> of paying Samsung a $20 premium for the heatsink edition of the 990 Pro.</p><div><form><div><h2>Verge Deals</h2><p><span>Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we’ve tested sent to your inbox weekly.</span></p></div></form></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Coming in an April system update, Nintendo is introducing a new game management system called “virtual game cards.” Virtual game cards are meant to function similarly to physical ones. When the feature goes live, purchases of digital games on the Nintendo eShop will automatically create a virtual game card that you’ll be able to manage from a dedicated screen.</p><p>Virtual game cards also make sharing games between consoles simpler. Using a local wi-fi connection, you can use virtual game cards to transfer digital games between Switch 1 and Switch 2 consoles. But perhaps the most interesting aspect of this feature is that now, you’ll be able to lend games to members of your Nintendo Switch Family account. You can only lend out one game per person and only for two weeks, but its still very neat that Nintendo has replicated the spirit of renting video games from Blockbuster.</p><p>Since Nintendo already told us the Switch 2 is backwards compatible, it seems like this new virtual game card system was created to ease the transition for players upgrading their consoles. We’ll learn more about the Swtich 2 and all its new features during the Switch 2 direct on April 2nd.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/atomfall/" data-ref-id="5000-631970">Atomfall </a>is a new open world, survival RPG that’s set in a post-apocalyptic version of 1950s England. A radioactive disaster has just occurred, and you’re locked inside the “Quarantine Zone” without any recollection as to how you got there or what’s happening around you. From the moment the game opens up to you, you’re able to go anywhere, complete any quest you come across, and explore numerous different areas within the game’s open-world zones.</p><p dir="ltr">The way Atomfall is designed makes it a different experience for every player. This can make it difficult to nail down just how long it takes to beat the game, as some players will take longer to reach the end than others based on the path they take. However, you can see a general timeframe for how long it takes to reach the end credits of Atomfall in the guide below.</p><h2 dir="ltr">How long is Atomfall - Campaign length</h2><p dir="ltr">For most players, Atomfall will take <strong>roughly 15-20 hours to beat</strong>. This is contingent on completing the main story and taking time to explore the different zones in the game, as you often don’t have exact quest markers to guide you to your next objective.</p><p dir="ltr">The way Atomfall works, though, can either expedite or prolong this timeline. There are actually several different main story questlines that you can embark on throughout the game, and each one takes multiple hours to complete. However, some of the main story questlines don’t need to be completed at all to reach the end of the game.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1632/16320660/4465136-atomfall_features_06.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4465136" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1632/16320660/4465136-atomfall_features_06.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4465136"></a><figcaption>No two Atomfall playthroughs will be much alike.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1632/16320660/4465136-atomfall_features_06.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">So, for example, if you pick the right main story questline to complete and don’t take part in too much side content, you could be done with Atomfall significantly faster than our estimated timeline. However, on the flip side, if you see all of the main story questlines to their end, then you’ll exceed the timeline and could spend <strong>over</strong> <strong>30 hours in Atomfall</strong>.</p><p dir="ltr">If you’re a completionist who wants to complete most or all of the main story questlines and partake in a majority of the side content, you could easily get <strong>40+ hours out of the game</strong>. There are a plethora of side quests you can go on in the Quarantine Zone, and the main story questlines can have over a dozen individual quests each that all take some time to get through.</p><p dir="ltr">You’ll find your quest log will soon be chock-full of different leads to investigations that can either pan out quickly or take the entire game to resolve. A seemingly run-of-the-mill side quest can actually be how you reach the end of the game, and an apparently important character could really be insignificant after you do a few quests for them.</p><p dir="ltr">It’s up to you what leads you choose to chase and which ones you leave to the wayside. All quests in Atomfall lead you to different parts of the various maps in the game, though, so you’ll have to eventually visit every single map even if you want to get through the main story quickly.</p><p dir="ltr">Suffice it to say, Atomfall isn’t a game that will be beaten in the same amount of time by most players. Players can have a completely different experience from other players depending on the choices they make, who they choose to trust, and what quests they want to complete. All of this results in a game that can be beaten fairly quickly or take significantly longer than the average time to beat.</p>

            <p>
Ever wondered why Pokémon Legends: Z-A is called that? There are a few notable coincidences already - Zygarde is likely to be the key mascot of this entry, with the previous game's being Arceus; and the mysterious character AZ, pronounced as "A, Z" returns here in a seemingly promintent role also - but now we have another explanation, via a new, seemingly quite important feature announced today, as part of the game's surprise appearance in the Nintendo Direct.
</p>
<p>
The new feature is called the Z-A Royale, a trainer-on-trainer tournament that takes place in Lumiose City after night falls. Here, the city's wild areas, previously outlined in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-legends-z-a-everything-we-know">Pokémon Legends Z-A</a>'s first full trailer, will turn into Battle Zones, where you can find opposing trainers waiting for you. It's mentioned that only "fierce" and "highly skilled trainers" are invited to participate, though that's swiftly followed by footage of you kicking things off with a Lv. 13 Totodile.
</p>
<p>
Earn enough Ticket Points, meanwhile, from defeating opponents and picking up 'bonus cards' by fulfilling certain challenges specified by the cards, and you'll earn a Challenger's Ticket, a requirement for undertaking a 'promotion match' where you can go up a rank. You'll start at Rank Z and, you guessed it, eventually climb to rank A - hence, Z-A. Curiously, it's mentioned that "trainers who reach the top are said to have a wish granted", which is likely a hint at the feature's role in the main story. Maybe you need a particular wish granted to defeat this entry's big bad?
</p>
<p>
In the trailer we also saw a little bit more of the new, hybrid battle system, that juggles real-time dodging with the order-based attacks of Legends: Arceus, and there are a few nice little twists in there for the eagle-eyed Pokémon fans. 
</p>
<p>
For one, now you can surprise other trainers, rather than the other way round - successfully sneak up and startle them before they make eye contact with you and you can use a surprise attack. This will always result in a critical hit, we're told, dealing hefty extra damage, in a similar method to the mechanic first introduced in Legends: Arceus that previously let you get an entire extra attack in on your opponent. 
</p>
<p>
We also got a first glimpse at how Mega Evolution will work in practice - an Alakazam was shown mega evolving into Mega Alakazam, when four bars had been filled in a glowing gauge in the bottom right. How you fill those up isn't clear just yet, though at one point the player-character's Lucario uses an attack and the gauge increases slightly, so it may be down to using attacks - or certain attacks - to charge it up.
</p>
<p>
Curiously, there's also a little figure of a person running over on the left of the in-battle screen, with the dash button icon next to it. At first glance, it looks like this might mean you can actually run away from trainer battles for the first time in the series' history, though we wouldn't be surprised if this was a feature only limited to these special night-time tournament bouts. In wild battles, by contrast, as we also saw in this new trailer, it's notable that you can just physically run away, rather than having to select it as an option.
</p>
<p>
Last but not least, this trailer also confirmed a few more Pokémon that'll be available in the games, most notably the full trio of elemental monkey Pokémon and their evolutions - Pansage and Simisage; Pansear and Simisear; and Panpour and Simipour - that were previously only available back in the X and Y and Omega Ruby and Alpha Sapphire days of generation six.
</p>
<p>For <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-legends-z-a-wont-arrive-until-late-2025">more on Pokémon Legends: Z-A, which won't release until "late 2025"</a>, it's worth looking through our roundup of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-everything-shown-at-this-years-pokemon-presents">everything revealed in the big Pokémon Presents</a> earlier this year. You can also look forward to some <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/lego-pokemon-announced-coming-2026">long-wished-for Pokémon Lego sets some time in 2026</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>As a reminder, this Direct doesn't have anything for you when it comes to the Switch 2; you'll have to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-officially-announced" rel="nofollow">wait until next week's show</a> for that. With that in mind, here's everything that was announced during today's Nintendo Direct showcase!</p>

<hr><h2><em>Dragon Quest I &amp; II HD Remaster</em>&nbsp;still coming this year</h2>

<p>First, we got to see a little footage from the upcoming JRPG collection&nbsp;<em>Dragon Quest I &amp; II HD Remaster</em>, which is still coming to Switch sometime this year. No release date was revealed for the collection, sadly.</p>

<h2><em>No Sleep for Kaname Date - From AI: The Somnium Files&nbsp;</em>is a&nbsp;<em>Zero Escape</em>-style adventure</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/nintendo-direct-march-2025-ai-somnium-files.jpg?itok=-Dhrt5J0 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/nintendo-direct-march-2025-ai-somnium-files.jpg?itok=_CzgAo5U 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>A new&nbsp;<em>AI: The Somnium Files&nbsp;</em>game is coming.</figcaption></figure><p>Next up, it's time to take a look at the next game in the&nbsp;<em>AI: The Somnium Files&nbsp;</em>series. This one stars detective Kaname Date, who must work together with the sophisticated AI embedded in his eye in order to save internet personality Iris from a "mysterious escape game". It's coming to Switch on July 25th.</p>

<h2><em>Raidou Remastered: The Mystery of the Soulless Army&nbsp;</em>has more Atlus RPG shenanigans</h2>

<p>A remastered version of Atlus' action RPG <i>Devil Summoner: Raidou Kuzunoha vs. the Soulless Army&nbsp;</i>is coming to Switch on June 19th. If you like&nbsp;<em>Persona&nbsp;</em>but wish the combat was a bit more active, this one's probably for you.</p>

<h2><em>Shadow Labyrinth&nbsp;</em>is, uh, a&nbsp;<em>Pac-Man&nbsp;</em>Metroidvania</h2>

<p>Have you ever wanted Pac-Man to star in his very own Metroidvania platformer? Well, you're in luck.&nbsp;<em>Shadow Labyrinth&nbsp;</em>is that very thing, although you're teaming up with "Puck" rather than exclusively playing as him. This one's coming on July 18th.</p>

<h2><em>Patapon 1+2 Replay&nbsp;</em>brings the&nbsp;<em>Patapon&nbsp;</em>games to Switch in July</h2>

<p>The PSP's&nbsp;<em>Patapon&nbsp;</em>games were some of that system's most delightful and joyful titles, and they're now coming to Switch as part of&nbsp;<em>Patapon 1+2 Replay</em>, which will hit the system on July 11th.</p>

<h2><em>Story of Seasons: Grand Bazaar&nbsp;</em>is a remake of a DS farming classic</h2>

<p>A new&nbsp;<em>Story of Seasons&nbsp;</em>game is coming to Switch...well, sort of.&nbsp;<em>Story of Seasons: Grand Bazaar&nbsp;</em>is a remake of the DS game (which was released under the series' previous&nbsp;<em>Harvest Moon&nbsp;</em>name), and it's coming on August 27th.</p>

<h2>More&nbsp;<em>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond&nbsp;</em>gameplay info revealed</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/metroid-prime-4-beyond-nintendo-direct-march-2025.jpg?itok=S1CsocbO 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/metroid-prime-4-beyond-nintendo-direct-march-2025.jpg?itok=1slXJ7c2 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond&nbsp;</em>is shaping up to be great, but I wish we had a release date for it.</figcaption></figure><p>Next, we got a new look at hotly-anticipated first-person shooter&nbsp;<em>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</em>. No release date, sadly, but we did get to see some of the game's combat, which looks like it's in the classic&nbsp;<em>Metroid Prime&nbsp;</em>tradition.</p>

<p>We also got to see some of Samus' new psychic abilities, which can be used both to explore the world around you and to enhance combat.</p>

<h2><em>Disney Villains Cursed Cafe</em>&nbsp;is essentially&nbsp;<em>Coffee Talk&nbsp;</em>with added Ursula</h2>

<p>If you thought&nbsp;<em>Coffee Talk&nbsp;</em>could use some extra villainy, this next one is for you.&nbsp;<em>Disney Villains Cursed Cafe&nbsp;</em>lets you brew potions and serve them to Disney villains, and the kinds of potions you brew can even have an effect on the story. You can play it on Switch later today.</p>

<h2><em>Witchbrook&nbsp;</em>looks like the cozy magic school game you've been waiting for</h2>

<p>Next, it's time for a look at Chucklefish's&nbsp;<em>Witchbrook</em>, a cozy magic school game in which you can fly on broomsticks, learn magic spells, and hang out with other witches. This one's heading to Switch sometime this holiday season.</p>

<h2>Action and arcade sizzle reel</h2>

<p>Nintendo showed an action and arcade-focused sizzle reel next, featuring THQ's hand-drawn platformer&nbsp;<em>The Eternal Life of Goldman&nbsp;</em>(coming this holiday), retro collection <i>Gradius Origins&nbsp;</i>(launching in August), and rhythm game&nbsp;<em>Rift of the NecroDancer&nbsp;</em>(coming to Switch today).</p>

<h2><em>Tamagotchi Plaza&nbsp;</em>is a new&nbsp;<em>Tamagotchi Connection&nbsp;</em>game</h2>

<p>In&nbsp;<em>Tamagotchi Plaza</em>, twelve stores await your help, and you can do everything from designing eyewear through to, uh, being a dentist. The game features over 100 "new and classic" Tamagotchi and launches on June 27th.</p>

<h2><em>Pokemon Legends: Z-A&nbsp;</em>sure does look fun</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pokemon-legends-z-a-nintendo-direct-march-2025.jpg?itok=O-ewIs2x 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pokemon-legends-z-a-nintendo-direct-march-2025.jpg?itok=pQ-yMcvi 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>You'll have to fight a lot of trainers to be the very best in&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Legends: Z-A</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>We were treated to some more&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Legends: Z-A&nbsp;</em>info next, although much of it was already revealed in February's&nbsp;<em>Pokemon&nbsp;</em>Presents show.</p>

<p>This Nintendo Direct showed off some of the game's Z-A Royale tournament, which will let you face off against fellow Trainers for the chance to "have a wish granted". Still no release date, though.</p>

<h2><em>Rhythm Heaven Groove&nbsp;</em>brings more fun rhythm minigames next year</h2>

<p>Next, we got to see a new entry in the&nbsp;<em>Rhythm Heaven&nbsp;</em>series, which is always welcome. This one will have lots of the franchise's signature quirky, off-the-wall minigames when it comes to Switch next year.</p>

<h2>Nintendo's new Virtual Game Card system looks...odd</h2>

<p>It looks like Nintendo is introducing a new system for game-sharing between Switch consoles. The Virtual Game Card system will render each digital purchase as a Virtual Game Card, which can then be loaded onto second Switch consoles using local communication.</p>

<p>Two systems can share cards freely, and you can also lend cards out to those on your family Switch account for two weeks. Nintendo says this system will make "digital games even easier to use", and it's being added in late April. It'll be used on Switch 2 as well.</p>

<h2>More sizzle reel goodness</h2>

<p>A few more games are making their way to Switch, and we got a sizzle reel for them. Here are the games that were featured in that reel.</p>

<ul><li><em>High on Life&nbsp;</em>(May 6th)</li>
	<li><em>Star Overdrive&nbsp;</em>(April 10th)</li>
	<li><em>The Wandering Village&nbsp;</em>(July 17th)</li>

<h2><em>Everybody's Golf: Hot Shots&nbsp;</em>brings wacky golf to Switch this year</h2>

<p>A new&nbsp;<em>Everybody's Golf&nbsp;</em>game is heading to Switch this year, bringing the series' signature cartoony golfing action to Nintendo's console. It'll support local play or online multiplayer for up to 4 players.</p>

<h2><em>Marvel Cosmic Invasion&nbsp;</em>calls back to retro beat-'em-ups</h2>

<p>Next, a beat-'em-up right out of the 16-bit era was revealed.&nbsp;<em>Marvel Cosmic Invasion&nbsp;</em>is a sidescroller from Dotemu that lets you play as classic Marvel heroes like Spider-Man, Captain America, and Venom, and it supports four-player co-op. It's coming this holiday.</p>

<h2><em>Tomodachi Life: Living the Dream&nbsp;</em>looks characteristically offbeat</h2>

            <p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/stardew-valley">Stardew Valley</a> publishers and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/starbound">Starbound</a> developers Chucklefish have conjured up the first proper trailer for Witchbrook, the magic school life sim some have called <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/renomine-wiz-school-rpg-spellbound-now-witchbrook">“isometric Little Witch Academia”</a>, and other, more English people <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/stardew-valley-harry-potter-project">“a reworking of The Worst Witch books”</a>. Me, I’m going with “isometric Kiki’s Delivery Service”, given that there appear to be delivery missions and also, you <em>do</em> get to fly on broomsticks. 
</p>
<p>
I italicised that “do” in honour of Alice Bee (RPS in peace), who <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/5-things-i-demand-from-witchbrook-chucklefishs-new-magical-stardew-like">threatened in 2020</a> to institute scoring on RPS specifically in order to give Witchbrook 0/10 if it didn’t have flying broomsticks. Nice save, Chucklefish! Here’s that trailer.

<p>
And here’s <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1846700/Witchbrook/">the Steam page</a>. Witchbrook seems like pretty standard, albeit beautifully presented Stardewlike fare, but it’s glamorised considerably by the fact that you can learn spells and potions, read the stars, and participate in occult rituals while pursuing your education at the titular Witchbrook College.
</p>
<p>
When not hitting the grimoires, you’ll also get to decorate your very own witch’s cottage and pursue a range of relationships in the town of Mossport, with its many persistent NPCs. The Steam blurb suggests that you can form a coven. I’ve always wanted to form a coven. They sound like unions but you can hex people instead of going on strike.
</p>
<p>
There’s also scope for such non-witchy, extra-curricular and/or entrepreneurial activities as shopping at the boutique, selling goods at the Sunday market, founding a business and playing local photographer. The witch of today loves to diversify, it seems. 
</p>
<p>
Witchbrook will launch in holiday 2025. In her article threatening to give the game a 0/10, Alice also demanded pet options besides dogs and cats, an occult range of things to farm, the ability to get put in detention for skipping classes, and *squints* the right to fuck a ghost. I’m pretty sure 50% of that is in the trailer. 
</p>
<p>
Myself, I will only add that I feel like Witchbrook’s witches could be wickeder. I get that this is another idyll for people who seek relief from reality’s cares in the endless watering of pixelart turnips, but I would quite like to build a gingerbread house and start a business catching and roasting small children. I won't give the game a 0/10 if it doesn't meet my needs, but it's definitely not scoring above a 7.

" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>With the era of the original Switch just about to set below gaming’s horizon, Nintendo has hit the internet with a curtain call of a Direct for the portable console.</p><p>While next week’s,  Switch 2-focused Direct on April 3 is likely to set the internet ablaze, this was everything we saw for today, March 27, 2025's Nintendo Direct.</p></div></div><div><p>Showing off some luscious visuals, we got a nice look at the return of <em>Dragon Quest 1</em> and <em>2</em>, which follow last year’s <em>Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake</em>. The release is expected to arrive this year, but no solid release date was provided.</p></div><div><p>In this new detective-focused game in the <em>AI: The Somnium Files </em>series, you’ll have to help out a poor idol in distress trapped on a space station with low oxygen, solving mysteries and such to help her. <em>No Sleep For Kaname Date</em> launches on July 25, 2025.</p></div><div><p>A remastered version of <em>Raidou</em>, originally released for PlayStation 2 in 2006 as <em>Devil Summoner: Raidou Kuzunoha vs. the Soulless Army</em>,<em>&nbsp;</em>is heading to the Switch on June 19, 2025.</p></div><div><p>With some sick-looking dark environments, the edgy <em>Pac-Man </em>spin-off <em>Shadow Labyrinth</em> promises some brutal fights in which you can not only beat the crap out of your foes, but also eat them for enhanced abilities. <em>Shadow Labyrinth</em> launches on July 18.</p></div><div><p>If you have fond memories of playing <em>Patapon</em> on PSP, good news! You can relive the portable experience with remasters of <em>Pataon 1 </em>and <em>2 </em>on the Switch, launching on July 11, and get that infectious rhythm stuck in your head all over again. <br></p></div><div><p>Want another farming sim? How about a throwback to the DS era? <em>Story of Seasons: Grand Bazaar</em> hits the Switch on August 27, 2025.</p></div><div><p>With some absolutely gorgeous-looking environments, our girl Samus is back in first-person mode to hopefully escape a hostile planet. While <em>Dread</em> absolutely owned, it’s gonna be pretty sweet to focus on alien-blasting and scanning stuff yet again from inside her helmet. She’s also got some pretty neat psychic abilities for combat and exploration.</p><p><em>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</em> arrives on the Switch sometime in 2025.</p></div><div><p>Coffee and tea are pretty sweet, but in <em>Disney Villains Cursed Cafe</em>, you’ll get to make some nifty potions with unique narrative outcomes based on your choices. The game is out today, March 27.</p></div><div><p>How about a magic school that doesn’t suck? Well, that’s the dream anyway. <em>Witchbrook</em> features some nice-looking pixel art, magical learnings, and even co-op for up to four players. The game arrives on Switch this holiday season.</p></div><div><p>Billed as a “hand-drawn platforming adventure,” <em>The Eternal Life of Goldman </em>will let you smack the crap out of fools with a cane. Fun! <br></p></div><div><p>Oh hell yeah. Schmup fans will be eating well with this sick-looking collection of the <em>Gradius</em> franchise featuring not only some classics, but also a new adventure with <em>Salamander III</em>.</p></div><div><p>Haven’t you ever wanted to start a band to take on dark forces? Well, you can live out that very dream with <em>Rift of the Necrodancer</em>, available for the Switch today, March 27.</p></div><div><p>With adorable little meeps for dialogue, <em>Tamagotchi Plaza</em> looks like a chill store-management sim where you can explore all of your retail dreams, only cuter. This one arrives on Switch on June 27.</p></div><div><p>What do you mean you still haven’t caught ‘em all? Today we got another look at <em>Pokémon Legends Z-A</em>, in which a corporation is in charge of urban development, you know, to let humans and Pokémon live in peace together. It’s totally not an open air prison for the powerless critters.</p></div><div><p>If you’re looking for a rhythm game that drills timing down to the basics, <em>Rhythm Heaven Groove</em> eschews grand storylines and epic settings for something a bit more focused on timing your button presses to the beat. Past entries have been a delight, so it’s great to see this series make its way to Switch.</p></div><div><p>Hey, there’s a new Switch on the horizon. It’s left many of us wondering what’s gonna happen with our digital games; after all, many of us have dumped a fair bit of coin into that eShop. </p><p>Fortunately, Nintendo is promising us the ability to easily transport digital games via a virtual game card management system across two different Nintendo Switch systems (the trailer seems to indicate that’s the limit). You’ll also be able to share games within your Nintendo family. The feature is coming to both the Switch and the Switch 2, and is expected to arrive in April of this year.</p></div><div><p>Stoner-FPS-fest <em>High On Life</em> is hitting the Nintendo Switch on May 6, perfect for extended periods of couch lock for you troublemakers.</p></div><div><p>Promising speedy action adventure across a strange alien world, <em>Star Overdrive</em> lands on the Switch on April 10.</p></div><div><p>This alien settlement management sim arrives on the Switch on July 17.</p></div><div><p>A sequel to the Nintendo 3DS’ <em>Fantasy Life, The Girl Who Steals</em> <em>Time </em>promises open-world exploration and item crafting when it arrives on the Switch on May 21 of this year.<br></p></div><div><p>1999 PlayStation RPG<em> Saga Frontier II </em>is getting a remaster on the Switch. The original narrative is joined by some new story material and characters. <em>Saga Frontier II</em>’s remaster arrives on Switch today.</p></div><div><p><em>Monument Valley 1 </em>and <em>2 </em>promise chill adventures across geometrically complex environments. This package, which includes all DLC, on April 15, 2025. The third game, which released on Android in December of 2024, will also make its way to the Switch this summer.</p></div><div><p><em>Everybody’s Golf</em>, aka <em>Hot Shots Golf</em>, is making the leap from Sony platforms to the Switch with the appropriately titled <em>Everybody’s Golf: Hot Shots. </em>It arrives on Switch later this year. </p></div><div><p>If you’re craving some retro beat ‘em up action with legendary superheroes like Spider-Man and Wolverine, <em>Marvel Cosmic Invasion</em> looks like a pretty swell time, with single and cooperative play. <em>Marvel Cosmic Invasion </em>arrives this holiday season.</p></div><div><p>The event’s final game reveal showed off the newest <em>Tomodachi</em> release in 10 years with this strange teaser that is already resulting in memes galore on social media.</p></div><div><p>At the very end of the event, Nintendo announced that they’ll continue the Direct series of video presentations, but they’re also launching a new channel via an app called Nintendo Today. It promises to update you every day with Nintendo news, which will be especially promising for next week’s big Switch 2 reveal. </p><p>The app is available for download today.</p><hr><p><br>And that wraps everything we saw at the original Switch’s final Nintendo Direct!</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
