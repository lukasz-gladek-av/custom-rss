It isn't a new RPG like <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/star-trek-adventures-second-edition-sets-course-for-strange-new-worlds" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Star Trek Adventures</em></a> or <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/star-trek-captains-log-solo-roleplaying-game-charts-new-course" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Captain's Log</em></a>, but a card game based on the animated spin-off show, <em>Star Trek: Lower Decks</em>. The game, <em>Star Trek: Lower Decks - Buffer Time </em>aims to bring the show's comedy into a game about balancing work with relaxation.</p>
<h2>The <em>Star Trek: Lower Decks - Buffer Time</em> Announcement</h2>
<p>According to an official press release, <em>Star Trek: Lower Decks - Buffer Time</em> is an accessible card game designed for both die-hard <em>Star Trek</em> fans and casual party game fans. It will also aim to capture the humor of the <em>Star Trek: Lower Decks</em> show.</p>

All players must work together to complete menial assignments while stationed on a Starfleet ship, all while making time for relaxation. Can your crew squeeze enough "buffer time" into duty rotation before the bridge crew figures out what's going on?</p>
<p>The game's project manager, Jim Johnson had this to say about the game:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"It’s a fast-playing card game that’ll have you laughing and crying. I’m super excited to be able to expand our <em>Star Trek</em> license into card games, and I hope you check it out and have fun with your group playing this one! Just watch out for those senior officers–they’re allergic to buffer time and will find new menial tasks for you and your fellow lower deckers to complete.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Star Trek: Lower Decks</em> debuted on CBS All Access in August of 2020. As the name implies, the show doesn't focus on a Starfleet ship's captains or senior officers, but on low-ranking officers with menial jobs getting into absurd situations. Its fifth and final season is set to release in October 2024 on Paramount+.</p>
<p><em>Star Trek: Lower Decks - Buffer Time </em>will be sold at an MSRP of $19.99. At the time of writing, there is no release date.</p>

            <p>
With <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/frontier-officially-announces-planet-coaster-2-now-with-water-parks">Planet Coaster 2's big reveal</a> out the way, Frontier Developments is ready to start talking specifics - and it's now done just that in the first in a series of developer deep dives, showcasing some of the sequel's new features in 15 minutes of first gameplay.
</p>
<p>
The big new thing in Planet Coaster 2 is , of course, water - or rather water parks, with the likes of pools, lazy rivers, and flumes. Frontier's deep dive offered a quick walk through the basics here, noting its sparkly new pools can be carved into the earth using geometric or custom shapes, while body flumes - just like rollercoasters - can be constructed piece-by-piece. Expect to see the likes of plughole, sphere, vertical, and boomerang flume pieces, even a six-person raft flume ride, adding variety to the basic flume styles.
</p>
<p>
Flumes, like any other ride, can be ridden in first-person, and also have their own excitement, nausea, and fear levels that'll determine whether guests want to ride them. Also like other rides, they'll work with Planet Coaster 2's suite of new customisation options, with players able to assign them colours, pre-defined patterns, and more.
</p>

<p>
Unsurprisingly, given the focus on creativity over management in the first game, customisation opportunities have been expanded significantly in Planet Coaster 2, with one of the most notable additions being the ability to attach scenery parts directly to coasters and flat rides - which will then appropriately animate in tandem with whatever they're attached to. Expanded tools also help reduce the number of steps required when decorating rides, with players able to quickly mirror customisations or instantly copy them across ride cars.
</p>
<p>
To accommodate these improved customisation opportunities, rides in Planet Coaster 2 will be much plainer compared to the elaborate versions in the first game - although ride blueprints (which now include flat ride blueprints) will once again enable players to share their creations via the game's workshop, so less creative sorts still have something nice to plop in their parks.
</p>
<p>
There's also a new asynchronous cross-platform co-op mode so players can share a park with a friend - who can then hop in, make some changes or additions, then send it back. It's not the sort of fully fledged co-op mode seen in developer Texel Raptor's stellar 2018 theme park sim Parkitect, but it's something at least. And it'll work across all three core modes - Career, Sandbox, and Franchise - even enabling friends to co-operate on leaderboard challenges. Oh, and, yes, there'll be rollback tools to stop your friends from cocking up your creations.
</p>

<p>
Elsewhere, Planet Coaster 2 massively overhauls the first game's notoriously finicky pathing tools - its now possible to create large plaza-like pathed areas simply by drawing out their shape - and there are new additions on the management side too. Power, for instance, is now a resource players will need to supply in sufficient quantities in order to keep their parks running, and the new weather system also introduces a few wrinkles, with players needing to provide sunscreen and shade for their water park sunbathers. 
</p>
<p>
In fact, today's deep dive suggests the majority of new management features will be tied to water parks. Players will also need to hire lifeguards, purchase and maintain water filtration systems for flumes and pools, as well as provide changing facilities, park services to supply pool passes, and set up stores selling inflatable to wring more money out of guests.
</p>
<p>
Other nuggets of information shared in Frontier's Planet Coaster 2 deep dive (and subsequent Q&amp;A) included confirmation that hotels will be absent from the sequel, despite the introduction of a new Resort scenery theme, and that the complexity meter will return for console players, limiting the amount of items they can put in their parks. Additionally, saves and workshop creations won't carry over from the first game, given Planet Coaster 2 is a "full rebuild".
</p>
<p>
As a suite of creative tools, then, Planet Coaster 2 is looking extremely impressive - even if this first proper gameplay breakdown does suggest the original's rather lacklustre management side won't be notably more robust. Still, that might change as Frontier reveals more Planet Coaster 2 details in the run-up to its Xbox Series X/S, PS5, and PC release this "autumn".

They'll also need to make promises to players, and whether they're kept or not will determine how they play throughout the season.</p><p dir="ltr">Another feature being introduced in Madden NFL 25 is Team Builder.

The Franchise mode hub will also include a feature that makes it easier to navigate everything.

            <p>I'm hooked on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dune-imperium">Dune Imperium</a>, a deckbuilder and worker placement digital board game I'm only just beginning to get my head around. Here comes some news to send my head spinning again: the Rise Of Ix expansion is out now, which adds three new factions, six new leaders, a new mode and much more.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The Rise Of Ix expansion is currently only available for the Steam version of the game, where <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3051590/Dune_Imperium__Rise_of_Ix/">it costs £8.50</a>. 
</p>
<p>Ix adds additional strategic layers to the existing game, including a technology track for players to advance along, and new dreadnought units that can be used during combat. All of these are represented as new spaces on the board to which players can send their agents.
</p>
<p>There are also 35 new cards which can be added to your deck, and a new Epic Game Mode where where players fight for 12 victory points rather than the 10 of the base game. I've wished almost every match of Dune Imperium I've played could have gone longer, and I wonder if this might fulfil that wish.
</p>
<p>The update also comes with a set of bugfixes for the base game, including improvements to the AI that takes over when players resign, improved AI behaviour when playing Staged Incident, and other miscellaneous improvements to skirmish games.
</p>
<p>Earlier this month, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-rally-point-spice-wars-imperium-and-the-trouble-with-a-dune-strategy-game">Sin played both recent Dune strategy games, Imperium and real-time cousin Spice Wars</a>. She found both to be successful adaptations, in spite of or because of all they jettison from the source material.</p>
<p>I haven't played Spice Wars, which means I can confidently state that Imperium is definitely better. I'm not sure if I'm going to dive immediately into Rise Of Ix - I really don't feel as if I'm bored of the base game yet - but I'll definitely get to it in due course.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Simple enough. But for a long time during the Xbox 360’s run, the console used Microsoft Points, a virtual currency created by Xbox. This was already annoying enough, but what made matters worse was that the conversion for dollars to Microsoft Points was needlessly complicated. 80 points cost $1 USD. So doing the math for purchases was a pain. Luckily, this all went away in 2013.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="65b375ec1561fa2212731e414cee346c" data-recommend-id="image://65b375ec1561fa2212731e414cee346c" data-format="png" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="An image shows the Summer of Arcade logo." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="An image shows the Summer of Arcade logo." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Xbox</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="65b375ec1561fa2212731e414cee346c" data-recommend-id="image://65b375ec1561fa2212731e414cee346c" data-format="png" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="An image shows the Summer of Arcade logo." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>The Xbox 360 wasn’t the first console to offer digital games to players, but it was the first to really embrace the concept and support it long-term.

As the generation went on, it became wild how many big Xbox 360 games shipped on two, three, or even four DVDs while PS3 games rarely exceeded one Blu-ray. When the Xbox One arrived, Microsoft learned its lesson and supported Blu-ray.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="fd1edb324d1d92d20e47a9a3dcfeb4a6" data-recommend-id="image://fd1edb324d1d92d20e47a9a3dcfeb4a6" data-format="png" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Xbox</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="fd1edb324d1d92d20e47a9a3dcfeb4a6" data-recommend-id="image://fd1edb324d1d92d20e47a9a3dcfeb4a6" data-format="png" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Before the Xbox 360, consoles didn’t track what games you played beyond whatever saves you created while playing stuff. But with the Xbox 360, Microsoft invented a whole new concept: Video game achievements. The idea was that every game on Xbox 360 would offer a series of challenges that could be completed for points and that the console would track all of this. I was one of the many people who spent a lot of time grinding for those achievements. </p><p>There was something so cool about a game rewarding you for doing something really hard, weird, or surprising while you played it. And being able to look back at your video game accomplishments and history years later was also rad. 360’s achievements were such a popular and smart concept that basically everybody else—including Sony and Valve—copied the system and it’s still around today.<br></p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="b4bdd171c78499fdd737f2c373ca3032" data-recommend-id="image://b4bdd171c78499fdd737f2c373ca3032" data-format="png" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Xbox</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="b4bdd171c78499fdd737f2c373ca3032" data-recommend-id="image://b4bdd171c78499fdd737f2c373ca3032" data-format="png" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>The OG Xbox locked multiplayer behind a paywall, something that people criticized at the time.

The post linked an account page that appears to belong to Parsons called “bngpparsons.”<br></p><p>The page lists over a dozen classic cars and motorcycles that the Bungie executive seemingly won in auctions between September 2022 and June 2024. A 1967 Jaguar XKE Series I 4.2 Roadster has a winning bid of $205,000 in December 23, 2022. A 1971 Porsche 911S Coupe has a winning bid of $201,000 in November 22, 2023, the month after Bungie’s first round of mass layoffs. The winning bids for all auctions listed totals around $2.4 million. Many of the vehicles show up in a photo album on Flickr called “Avants Parsons garage tour 2024" which shows the CEO and others examining vintage cars in a commercial-sized garage. </p><p>“How exciting!” the bngpparsons account wrote after winning the Chevy in June. “I have wanted a c1 since I was a little kid. My second hot wheel ever (in gold). Going to its forever home.”</p><p>It’s unclear if the millions spent on the collection came from the Sony buyout or Parsons’ lifelong work at Bungie, and the amount would have likely been a drop in the bucket compared to the massive cuts being asked of the studio as a whole. But so far there doesn’t seem to be any evidence that senior Bungie leadership has taken salary cuts or pursued other cost-saving measures in solidarity with laid-off staff or those still employed who may struggle to make ends meet. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.ign.com/articles/bungie-devs-say-atmosphere-is-soul-crushing-amid-layoffs-cuts-and-fear-of-total-sony-takeover&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bungie-devs-say-atmosphere-is-soul-crushing-amid-layoffs-cuts-and-fear-of-total-sony-takeover" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>IGN</em> reported last fall</a></span> that when a Bungie department head was asked if Parsons or others were taking pay cuts amid the studio’s current crisis, they said it’s “not that type of company.”</p><p>When Sony originally purchased Bungie, some employees were optimistic.

They also said they were told the acquisition would result in “absolutely no layoffs” and that nothing “major” in terms of restructuring would happen as a result of the deal. Two years later, Parsons has 20 more cars and over a quarter of the company has been laid off. </p><p>Parsons did not immediately respond to a request for comment. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p dir="ltr">It all looks fairly similar to the support hero Lucio from <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/overwatch-2/" data-ref-id="5000-504256">Overwatch 2</a>, who wields an almost identical-looking gun and features similar music-based AOE abilities that heal or speed up teammates. If there's one major difference, it's that Luna doesn't have rollerblades (though in the gameplay trailer she does skate around on a hovering disc at one point), something that does make up a large part of how it feels to play Lucio in Blizzard's 6v6 shooter.</p><p dir="ltr">Aside from Luna, the first content update for the free-to-play shooter also adds an Ultimate version of the water-bending Valby Descendant, who comes equipped with a fancy new nano suit that allows access to new modification modules that change up gameplay. The update additionally adds a new Void Intercept Boss, Gluttony, a massive machine that if defeated will earn players blueprints for new ultimate weapons and components.</p><p dir="ltr">The First Descendant seems to have done well for itself since its July 2 launch, staying among the top-played and top-earning games on Steam and reaching more than <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-first-descendant-already-has-10-million-players/1100-6524898/" data-ref-id="1100-6524898">10 million players within its first week</a>. Developer Nexon recently received criticism over <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-first-descendant-icons-that-look-eerily-similar-to-destiny-2s-will-be-changed/1100-6524951/" data-ref-id="1100-6524951">The First Descendant's use of in-game icons that looked almost identical to those in Destiny 2</a>. Nexon stated it would change the icons and "make adjustments to ensure that the imagery that may appear similar clearly reflects the unique identity of our game."</p>

There are some complexities to the game, especially in its differences to <em>Magic</em>. Instead of different colors of magic there are eight different elements that determine similar attributes. Players still must construct a deck of their own, in <em>FFTCG</em> it must have 50 cards exactly. You win by dealing seven points of damage to your opponent directly. </p><p>There are also some specific mechanics that the <em>FFTCG </em>has that try to fix common issues with <em>MTG</em>. As laid out in a helpful <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/FinalFantasyTCG/comments/178joq8/sell_me_on_this_game/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FinalFantasyTCG/comments/178joq8/sell_me_on_this_game/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Reddit</a></span> post , <em>FFTCG </em>has a smart resource system in place to combat<em> MTG</em>’s common bottlenecking problem that forces you into a card draw loop. It also has a mechanic called EX Burst that gives losing players a better chance at changing the tides, giving you more control over how the game plays out rather than you being so beholden to card draws. </p><figure id="" data-id="c5fd3a490e691b56e63d0018dd038417" data-recommend-id="image://c5fd3a490e691b56e63d0018dd038417" data-format="jpg" data-width="1278" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A Ysayle Final Fantasy Trading Card Game card" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A Ysayle Final Fantasy Trading Card Game card" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="c5fd3a490e691b56e63d0018dd038417" data-recommend-id="image://c5fd3a490e691b56e63d0018dd038417" data-format="jpg" data-width="1278" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A Ysayle Final Fantasy Trading Card Game card" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>All those specific mechanics make <em>FFTCG </em>sound great, and as someone who has only ever dipped her toes in card games but never fully taken the dive, it makes me feel like this could be a more welcoming experience. The card designs are also a major part of that. I have a strong affinity for the <em>Final Fantasy</em> series and its long-history of impeccable character designs. Seeing some of my favorite protagonists, villains, and weird little guys rendered in a beautiful art style on the cards makes me want to buy a bunch of them, even if just to look at them. I haven’t actually played a match yet, and it’s not just because I only have one card.<br></p><p>There are fans of the <em>FFTCG </em>out there. Just look at the game’s <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/FinalFantasyTCG/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FinalFantasyTCG/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">subreddit</a></span> or dedicated sites like <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;http://ffdecks.com&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="http://ffdecks.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ffdecks.com</a></span>, but the community is definitely smaller than <em>MTG</em>’s. Living in New York City, I’m sure I could find a local game shop that does run the occasional game, but by and large, opportunities for playing seem few and far between. As a newcomer it’s hard to find a casual place to learn the basics. I could buy as many cards as I want and read over the rules (which I have done) but I wouldn’t have people to play with, and I don’t think my fiancée would appreciate me trying to force her to play. This makes it all the more confusing to me that there isn’t an online version. </p><p>With the likes of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/magic-the-gathering-arena-the-kotaku-review-1834790330&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/magic-the-gathering-arena-the-kotaku-review-1834790330"><em>Magic: The Gathering Arena</em></a></span> making that card game more accessible to players across the world, and a great point of entry for curious newcomers, it feels like a no-brainer for the <em>FFTCG</em>. Yet, until a good online version of the game is released, I think my growing interest in the <em>Final Fantasy Trading Card Game</em> will be limited to purchasing cards so I can look at them. Though it turns out my friend’s gift was strategically timed, as on August 2, <em>FFTCG </em>will release <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://fftcg.square-enix-games.com/en/news/new-product-information-hidden-trials-booster-pack-set&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://fftcg.square-enix-games.com/en/news/new-product-information-hidden-trials-booster-pack-set" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Hidden Trials</em></a></span>, its latest set . Maybe I need to consider setting up Discord matches, at least that way I can excuse the ill-advised spending I’m thinking about doing right now.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The subscription model is coming to the gaming PC market. <a href="https://nzxt.com/collection/flex" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">NZXT has announced</a> NZXT Flex, a gaming PC subscription service that offers players modern gaming machines for a monthly rate.</p>



<p>“At NZXT, we believe everyone should be able to play the games they love,” said Bryan de Zayas, NZXT’s Head of Marketing, via release. “In the past, that meant buying a pre-built PC or building your own.&nbsp; Our new Flex subscription service offers gamers more flexibility and choice, so they can focus on what really matters – playing the games they love.”</p>



<p>NZXT Flex offers three plans for players depending on what they want to pay and the specs of their PC. The cheapest plan, which starts at $59 per month, includes an Intel Core i5 CPU and an  Nvidia RTX 4060. For $119 per month, you can get an AMD Ryzen 5 5600X and RTX 4070. Lastly, for $169 per month, you can get a Core i7-13700KG and a RTX 4070 Ti Super.</p>



<p>All models and components are subject to availability and what are the current parts. </p>



<figure></figure>



<p>As far as the subscription is concerned, NZXT says you can cancel at any time with the ability to return or upgrade your PC. They also guarantee upgrades every two years.</p>



<p>Lastly, and most importantly to many, is that there are no upfront costs nor are there cancellation or replacement fees.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.pocketpair.jp/palworld"><em>Palworld</em></a>'s head of community has a radical idea: Stop caring about how many people are playing a game at the same time as you. It's pitched mostly at developers and games media, but John Buckley also wants players to let go of the "dead game" mentality.</p>
<p>"Who cares if there's only five people playing it? Just enjoy yourself. Just enjoy games. I don't think it needs to be any more complex than that," Buckley said in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NO38QvKraTQ">an interview on the Going Indie YouTube channel</a>.</p>
<p>The people at <em>Palworld</em> developer Pocketpair, in particular, would have reason for panic, if they subscribed to the mentality that active online players are the key benchmark for modern gaming. The game launched into Early Access in January 2024 at rocket speed, selling 5 million copies and reaching 1.3 million concurrent Steam players, surpassing <em>Elden Ring </em>and <em>Baldur's Gate 3</em>. By February 1, the game had sold 19 million between Xbox and Steam, and was <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/02/palworld-has-biggest-3rd-party-game-pass-launch-ever-as-players-near-20-million/">the biggest third-party game launch</a> yet on Xbox's Game Pass service.
</p><p>Given that the creature-catching/survival game with <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/01/pokemon-company-will-investigate-palworld-in-light-of-plagiarism-accusations/">a notably chill approach to intellectual property</a> has so far managed to avoid being sued into oblivion by Pokémon, most would consider it a success. And yet, gaming sites and streaming personalities made sure to note that <em>Palworld&nbsp;</em>suffered "<a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/palworld/steam-player-drop">Steam's biggest-ever two-week drop</a>" by mid-February or was "looking like a dead game," as streamer Asmongold said into the microphone around that same time.</p>

<h2>“It is fine to take breaks from games”</h2>
<p>As far back as February 20, Buckley (or "Bucky") has been pushing back against metrics as the thing that matters. "This emerging "<em>Palworld has lost X% of its player base</em>" discourse is lazy," <a href="https://x.com/Bucky_cm/status/1757796446739558795">Buckley wrote on X</a>, "but it's probably also a good time to step in and reassure those of you capable of reading past a headline that it is fine to take breaks from games." Lots of what Buckley wrote then, and said in the recent interview, is some combination of common sense and remarkable candor: Stop when you're done, play other games, try different genres, support indies, in particular, and don't worry about <em>Palworld</em>, which will put out more content, but not constantly.</p>                                                                        
                                                                                
<p>As noted by Going Indie's host, a "dead game" can earn that label through many vectors: concurrent players, developer support, or competitive environment, to name a few. Every game in existence will be "dead," eventually, and that used to be a normal, good thing. Developers started new projects, and players looked forward to new experiences.</p>
<p>But the advent of "live service" games, meant to pull in more money over time through subscriptions and microtransactions, has made a game something that publishers, especially the large kind, never want to see die. They create consistent revenue, rather than the spikes of traditional game publishing, and there are North Stars to look to, like <em>GTA Online.&nbsp;</em>(Or, <a href="https://www.bungie.net/7/en/News/article/newpath">until recently</a>,&nbsp;<em>Destiny&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Destiny 2</em>).</p>
<p>"I don't think it really serves anyone to push gamers to just play the same game day in, day out," Buckley tells Going Indie. While some games, like <em>League of Legends</em> or an MMO, are built to avoid burnout, "Whereas what we're seeing now is a trend of—I won't necessarily say who's trying to push it, but a lot more people are trying to push gamers to play games that aren't really designed to be played for months on end."</p>
<figure><figcaption><p>"Updates, updates, for the good of our economy, there must be more updates."</p><p>Pocketpair</p></figcaption></figure>
<h2><em>Palworld</em> suggests people like new things</h2>
<p>While&nbsp;<em>Palworld</em> allows for online play, its huge concurrent player numbers were not the result of its developer carefully cultivating a fear of missing out (FOMO) among players. As Ars' Andrew Cunningham wrote at the peak of <em>Palworld's</em> success, it was more about the devs giving something new to a community that had been habitually starved for something truly new:</p>                                                                        
                                                                                
<blockquote><p>Sure, many people are here to see a machine-gun-toting Pikachu mow down other Pikachu. But a ton of people are <em>also</em> there to voice some kind of discontent with the&nbsp;Pokémon franchise as it currently stands, expressing a desire for a deeper and more communal game. ... I think we can look at the combination of reviews, sales, and active users and see that there is clearly an audience hankering for more radical change.</p></blockquote>
<p>In other words: Moving on to the next ideas rather than competing to keep the same limited pool of constantly online gamers engaged with shareholder-friendly continuity.</p>
<p>"I don't think you need to be kinda pushing yourself to play the same game all the time," Buckley says in the interview. "It's not healthy for us, it's not healthy for developers, it's not healthy for gamers, it's not healthy for gaming media, and it's just not healthy for our industry. Because the more we push this kind of narrative, the more very large companies are going to say, 'Gamers want more live service,' and we're just going to get more of these really soulless live service games that come out and then get shut down nine months later, 12 months later, because they're not making enough money."</p>

However, as players quickly realized, the new Radiant Echoes event isn't good for either one of those things due to how it's currently structured.</p><p dir="ltr">On paper, the event sounds fun. Memories of Azeroth's past manifest in one of three older zones, requiring players to complete various objectives in order to summon a boss from the game's long history, like the Lich King, Onyxia, or Ragnaros. Defeating enemies and the bosses, as well as completing objectives, earns players a new event currency, Residual Memories, that can be used to acquire catch-up gear and various cosmetics.</p>

      </div>
<p dir="ltr">It seems simple, but the main issue currently plaguing players is how infrequently the event is actually active. Rather than being active almost all the time, as many players expected and is usually the case for the game's pre-patch events, players complete the event for one zone in just a few minutes, after which it takes about an hour and a half for the event to cycle and begin in another zone. In the meantime, the game tells players it can stick around in the zone where the event was recently completed to farm lingering enemies, but those enemies drop such a small amount of event currency that players would need to kill thousands of them to earn enough to be able to purchase a single item. The best way to earn Residual Memories is to complete a daily quest that awards 1,500 of them, but even those can only be done three times a day on a single character, and still requires players waiting around for hours in order to complete.</p><p dir="ltr">This is, unfortunately, not a mistake but by design. In a <a href="https://news.blizzard.com/en-us/world-of-warcraft/24057483/the-war-within-radiant-echoes-event-now-live" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">blog post</a> detailing the event, Blizzard states that the interval between the event zones will be 90 minutes long for the first week. On week two, it will become more frequent, rotating every 60 minutes. For the third and final week of the event, it will cycle every 30 minutes.</p><p dir="ltr">The event being such a grind kind of goes against the whole purpose of the rewards, as the gear is meant to prepare characters for The War Within before quickly being replaced in the expansion proper. Given that the expansion is only a month away, it seems pointless to grind out the event as it currently stands, given how long it will take to gear up a single character and how quickly that gear will become irrelevant.</p><p dir="ltr">Players, as they do, took to the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">WoW subreddit</a> to voice their complaints. One player <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/1eg6rj7/i_feel_scammed_for_resubbing_for_the_prepatch/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">said</a> they felt "scammed" re-subbing for the event, comparing it unfavorably to the well-liked Legion pre-patch event from 2016.</p><p dir="ltr">"If you're not there right when it starts, it dies in like three minutes," Lpunit writes. "There is basically nothing to do outside of this event other than a 15 minute 'story' quest where nothing really happens. Does anyone else remember the Legion pre-patch event? It was just nonstop going."</p><p dir="ltr">The amount of time between events is the main point of criticism, with another player pointing the absurdity of it all.</p><p dir="ltr">"It's 90 minutes waiting for five minutes of lagging where you wish you can even see the boss to tag it, then wait in the lag if you get a reward," Ur-shak <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/1ego53a/if_you_isolate_the_gameplay_of_the_prepatch_event/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">writes</a>. "I stopped today to think what's the gameplay of that and the more you think about it the more absurd it is."</p><p dir="ltr">Given player feedback, it wouldn't be surprising if Blizzard quickly pivots on its intended plan to ramp up the event cycle over the next few weeks and instead lets it run almost constantly from the get-go, but Blizzard has not yet released an official response to player feedback.</p><p dir="ltr">In the meantime, thanks to the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-the-war-withins-warbands-were-born-out-of-a-desire-to-keep-pushing-for-an-account-wide-future/1100-6525203/" data-ref-id="1100-6525203">new Warbands feature</a>, players can funnel gear and event currency from one character to others on their account. That does make the event grind a little more tolerable, as the event's daily quest is completable on multiple characters and the currency earned can be funneled to other characters as needed, but it still requires players to wait around for the event to actually start.</p><p dir="ltr">The War Within, which introduces new sub specializations called Hero Talents for each class as well as a new form of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-is-finally-adding-a-new-endgame-activity-made-with-smaller-groups-in-mind/1100-6518919/" data-ref-id="1100-6518919">endgame content called Delves</a>, releases on August 26.

            <p>BioWare have said that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dragon-age-dreadwolf">Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a> is due for release sometime this autumn, causing many to predict it would arrive in September. That seems unlikely now, as EA say the RPG is due to launch in their financial third quarter which begins October 1st.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>EA's financial year begins April, with Q1 ending on June 30th and Q2 ending on September 30th. Its latest financial calendar lists The Veilguard has a Q3 release, putting it sometime this year, but in October or later, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragon-age-the-veilguard-release-date-narrowed">according to Eurogamer</a>..
</p>
<p>This is assuming that the game experiences no further development hiccups. That BioWare still haven't put a specific release date on the game means any prediction about its release is foolhardy.
</p>
<p>Edwin saw a 45-minute segment of The Veilguard <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-first-45-minutes-of-dragon-age-the-veilguard-feel-as-much-like-mass-effect-2-as-inquisition">back in June</a>. He found it to be more of a "single-character action-RPG" than a true party-based RPG in the vein of its predecessors, but he was also plenty impressed with its world, combat and characters. 
</p>
<blockquote>I am definitely in mourning for the less kinetic, more strategic Dragon Age that might have been, but I'm more excited for Veilguard than I thought I'd be after copping the first trailer, which makes the whole thing look like the origin story for a C-list Marvel team. It's worth remembering that Inquisition was often too knotty and expansive for its own good: its battle system is unwieldy, its story is a classic example of midgame bloat, and while Skyhold is a grand and imposing place, it's also a managerial nightmare in which you routinely forget where the crafting tables are, 70 hours in. If Veilguard can carve out the cruft without reducing party members to sidekicks, it could be the soft reboot this long-absent RPG series needs.</blockquote>
<p>The Veilguard has had a long road towards its current state of near-release, as perhaps indicated by us having already written 48 news stories about it since 2018. It was maybe going to be a live service game for a while, it was rebooted as the singleplayer-focused RPG it is now, and it was previously called Dreadwolf. It's a welcome surprise that there are positive vibes about it now that's seemingly mere months away.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/fallout-london-team-folon-working-on-major-bug-fixes/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Since its release, <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-london-is-now-available-for-download/">Fallout: London</a> has mostly been received positively, with many fans enjoying what the expansive mod offers. Of course, that's not to say there haven't been a couple of issues along the way. Team FOLON has made a statement to let fans know that they are actively working on bug fixes for the biggest issues and that they will be providing future updates to make Fallout: London as seamless as possible.</p>
<p>These bugs consist of crashes and other bugs. If you are experiencing crashes, there are ways to fix them for Fallout: London, such as installing Buffout 4. By installing this and putting it into the correct folders for Fallout: London, the mod becomes much more robust and crashes less frequently. However, players are still experiencing some major inconsistencies with quick saving, where the game will still crash if too much happens in the background during a quick save.</p>
<p>For those experiencing issues, it is recommended to join the Team FOLON Discord server, where there is ongoing tech support for those in need, and they can try and help you resolve any issues you may be facing. In addition, Team FOLON released a statement on X.</p>
<p>"Firstly, a massive thank you from everyone at Team FOLON. We are very grateful for the amazing attention Fallout: London is receiving, and we appreciate all the great feedback from you! It is truly heartwarming to see the community coming together to praise the release and help one another with it."</p>
<p>Attached to their statement, they included a link to the GOG forum page for Fallout: London, where players and Team FOLON members are <a href="https://www.gog.com/forum/fallout_london/fallout_london_quick_start_guide_common_bug_fixes/page1" target="_blank" rel="noopener">teaming up to help each other</a> out with any issues players may be experiencing. This includes an installation guide for the Buffout 4 mod, which helps massively with crashing issues.</p>
<p>"We're working hard to fix the reported technical issues and expect to release an update soon. Thank you for your patience!"</p>
<p>One of the most prominent bug fixes that Team FOLON is working on is the issue with player health and how it is handled after the first train crash. This issue disproportionately lowers the maximum HP of those with high health or endurance levels.</p>
<p>In addition to Team FOLON working on bug fixes, one modder has taken it upon themselves to fix the issue of players having an addiction to dog food. While it may sound comical and insignificant, it can cost the player a huge amount of currency, which is hard to come by in Fallout: London. This mod, created by modder Misslune is titled "<a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/fallout4london/mods/74?tab=description" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dog Food Addiction Remover</a>" and will make your player less likely to want to chow down on Prilladog 24/7.</p>

Only, once they found him, they realized that he had set his account to private, meaning that only pre-existing followers of Parsons could see his posts and respond to him. Many took to mocking his bio, which features a call to “be brave,” and stated that Parsons wasn’t living up to his own values.</p><p>Since then, Parsons, likely reacting to criticisms he was already receiving, has unlocked his account. Despite the gesture, Parsons hasn’t said anything about this morning’s layoffs, and has only shared the blog post via the official Bungie Twitter account.<br></p><p>Coming off the news, disgruntled former employees, fans of Bungie, and voices from around the games industry are now calling for Parsons to take further accountability and step down. Griffin Bennett, a developer who’d been with Bungie from 2018 until the 2023 layoffs, responded to the layoff announcement by calling out Parsons by name and demanding he quit, calling him a “joke.”</p><p>Ben Platnick, a former VFX artist at Bungie, went a step further, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/S3pirion/status/1818674023200702734&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/S3pirion/status/1818674023200702734" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">saying</a></span>, “Pete needs to fucking go. This is mismanagement at the highest level.” He goes on to claim that Parsons’ “spending on R&amp;D while <em>Destiny</em> was not doing the best would prove to be a money pit with no return. And my friends suffer because of it.”</p><p>Among the teams impacted by today’s layoffs, the Player Support team seems to have been particularly gutted. Some members have begun sharing their own stories of the last few months at Bungie working on <em>The Final Shape </em>and their growing distrust in the studio’s leadership, Parsons included.</p><p>Others in the games industry have begun chiming in and expressing their discontent with Parsons’ leadership and have joined in on calls for him to resign. Among the voices are Paul Tassi, who covers <em>Destiny </em>for Forbes, and the <em>Destiny</em>-centric content creator MyNameIsByf.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/destiny-developer-bungie-cuts-220-staff-some-of-the-most-difficult-changes-weve-ever-had-to-make-as-a-studio<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Destiny developer Bungie has today announced significant cuts at the studio that have seen 220 people, or 17% of the studio’s workforce, let go.</p><p>The cuts affect every level of the company, including most of the Sony-owned studio’s executive and senior leader roles, Bungie boss Pete Parsons said in a post on <a href="https://www.bungie.net/7/en/News/article/newpath" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bungie.net</a>. "Today is a difficult and painful day," Parsons added.</p><p>Departing staff will be offered "a generous exit package" that includes severance, bonus, and health coverage, Bungie promised.</p><p>Parsons blamed the cuts on the rising costs of development, "industry shifts," and "enduring economic conditions." Because of this, Parsons insistsed, Bungie has had to make "substantial changes" to its cost structure and focus development efforts entirely on live service looter shooter Destiny and the upcoming <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bungie-shakes-up-marathon-leadership-removes-chris-barrett-as-game-director">Marathon</a>.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>I realize all of this is hard news, especially following the success we have seen with The Final Shape.</p></div><p>The cuts come after what was seen as the successful launch of Destiny 2 expansion <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/destiny-2-the-final-shape">The Final Shape</a>. Parsons acknowledged this in his post, but said they were necessary "to refocus our studio and our business with more realistic goals and viable financials." Parsons also said the cuts were made "after exhausting all other mitigation options," although he failed to say what those options were.</p><p>The 220 layoffs come alongside the integration of an additional 155 roles, or 12% of Bungie's workforce, into parent company Sony Interactive Entertainment over the next few quarters. Parsons said this move saves "a great deal of talent that would otherwise have been affected by the reduction in force."</p><p>That suggests that if Sony hadn't taken on these 155 roles, 375 staff would have lost their jobs today, and that the actual reduction in Bungie's workforce over time will be substantially more than 17%.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Marathon CG Stills</h3></div></output><p>Meanwhile, Bungie is working with PlayStation Studios to spin out one of its incubation projects, an action game set in a brand-new sci-fi universe, to form a new studio under the PlayStation banner "to continue its promising development." Parsons did not say how many staff will leave Bungie to form this studio, but did admit "this will be a time of tremendous change for our studio."</p><p>Based on the information provided by Parsons, the total size of Bungie pre-layoffs was roughly 1300, so the number of staff leaving to join this new PlayStation developer is somewhere around 75. This also means the actual percentage of people leaving Bungie proper as a result of this restructuring is around 34%.</p><p>Parsons went on to explain how Bungie got to this point, confirming that the studio had been "running in the red" after its financial safety margins were exceeded following delays to both The Final Shape and Marathon and a rapid expansion that "stretched our talent too thin."</p><p>Over 850 staff remain at Bungie building Destiny and Marathon, Parsons said.</p><p>Here's the statement in full:</p><blockquote>This morning, I’m sharing with all of you some of the most difficult changes we’ve ever had to make as a studio. Due to rising costs of development and industry shifts as well as enduring economic conditions, it has become clear that we need to make substantial changes to our cost structure and focus development efforts entirely on Destiny and Marathon.  </blockquote><blockquote><strong>That means beginning today, 220 of our roles will be eliminated, representing roughly 17% of our studio’s workforce.   </strong></blockquote><blockquote>These actions will affect every level of the company, including most of our executive and senior leader roles.     </blockquote><blockquote>Today is a difficult and painful day, especially for our departing colleagues, all of which have made important and valuable contributions to Bungie. Our goal is to support them with the utmost care and respect. For everyone affected by this job reduction, we will be offering a generous exit package, including severance, bonus and health coverage.  </blockquote><blockquote>I realize all of this is hard news, especially following the success we have seen with The Final Shape. But as we’ve navigated the broader economic realities over the last year, and after exhausting all other mitigation options, this has become a necessary decision to refocus our studio and our business with more realistic goals and viable financials. </blockquote><blockquote>We are committing to two other major changes today that we believe will support our focus, leverage Sony’s strengths, and create new opportunities for Bungie talent.   </blockquote><blockquote>First, we are deepening our integration with Sony Interactive Entertainment, working to integrate 155 of our roles, roughly 12%, into SIE over the next few quarters. SIE has worked tirelessly with us to identify roles for as many of our people as possible, enabling us together to save a great deal of talent that would otherwise have been affected by the reduction in force.     </blockquote><blockquote>Second, we are working with PlayStation Studios leadership to spin out one of our incubation projects – an action game set in a brand-new science-fantasy universe – to form a new studio within PlayStation Studios to continue its promising development.   </blockquote><blockquote>This will be a time of tremendous change for our studio.  </blockquote><blockquote>Let’s unpack how we ended up in this position; it’s important to understand how we got here. </blockquote><blockquote>For over five years, it has been our goal to ship games in three enduring, global franchises. To realize that ambition, we set up several incubation projects, each seeded with senior development leaders from our existing teams. We eventually realized that this model stretched our talent too thin, too quickly.  It also forced our studio support structures to scale to a larger level than we could realistically support, given our two primary products in development – Destiny and Marathon.  </blockquote><blockquote>Additionally, in 2023, our rapid expansion ran headlong into a broad economic slowdown, a sharp downturn in the games industry, our quality miss with Destiny 2: Lightfall, and the need to give both The Final Shape and Marathon the time needed to ensure both projects deliver at the quality our players expect and deserve. We were overly ambitious, our financial safety margins were subsequently exceeded, and we began running in the red. </blockquote><blockquote>After this new trajectory became clear, we knew we had to change our course and speed, and we did everything we could to avoid today’s outcome. Even with exhaustive efforts undertaken across our leadership and product teams to resolve our financial challenges, these steps were simply not enough.   </blockquote><blockquote>As a result, today we must say goodbye to incredible talent, colleagues, and friends. </blockquote><blockquote>This will be a challenging time at Bungie, and we’ll need to help our team navigate these changes in the weeks and months ahead. This will be a hard week, and we know that our team will need time to process, to ask questions, and to absorb this news. Today, and over the next several weeks, we will host team meetings and town halls, team breakout sessions, and private, individual sessions to ensure we are keeping our communication open and transparent.  </blockquote><blockquote>Bungie will continue to make great games. We still have over 850 team members building Destiny and Marathon, and we will continue to build amazing experiences that exceed our players’ expectations.    </blockquote><blockquote>There will be a time to talk about our goals and projects, but today is not that day. Today, our focus is on supporting our people.  </blockquote><p>In March, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bungie-shakes-up-marathon-leadership-removes-chris-barrett-as-game-director">multiple sources told IGN</a> that Bungie was in the midst of shifting around its creative leadership on Marathon, including removing long-time Bungie designer Christopher Barrett from the game director role. IGN learned he was being replaced by former Valorant game director Joe Ziegler, who <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/riot-games-i-valorant-i-director-leaves-studio-for-bungie" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">left Riot Games for Bungie</a> in 2022.</p><p>At the time, IGN was told that Bungie was pouring resources into getting Marathon out the door. The game's direction had shifted somewhat under Ziegler's new leadership, one source said, including moving away from custom player characters in favor of a selectable cast of heroes.</p><p>There were also internal fears and rumors that layoffs would immediately follow the release of The Final Shape, with one source saying "nothing adds up" and "something will need to happen to curb costs unless The Final Shape does so well to cover the gap and people can move to Marathon."</p><p>Unfortunately, those fears have now been realized.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Destiny 2: The Final Shape Launch Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>Bungie has found itself rocked by a number of major shake-ups in recent years that have tanked morale at the studio and left its future uncertain. Sony <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-has-completed-its-37-billion-deal-to-acquire-bungie-and-welcome-it-into-the-playstation-family">officially acquired the studio mid-2022</a>, with the promise it would largely retain a semblance of freedom as an independent subsidiary. Sources told IGN that's largely remained true, but Bungie has struggled to meet key financial targets, with Destiny 2 significantly underperforming last year.</p><p>In October, Bungie <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bungie-devs-say-atmosphere-is-soul-crushing-amid-layoffs-cuts-and-fear-of-total-sony-takeover">laid off roughly 100 of its then-1,200 employees</a> amid greater cost-cutting measures that saw Marathon delayed to 2025 and employee benefits slashed, further damaging the mood internally.</p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/braid">Braid: Anniversary Edition</a> "sold like dog shit" according to creator Jonathan Blow.
</p>
<p>Blow discussed the remasters sales performance across several Twitch streams since its release back in May, going so far as to suggest that the studio's "future is uncertain" as a result of low sales.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The comments were <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8KR5i98aCy0&amp;ab_channel=BlowFan">collated as a series of stream clips by YouTuber Blow Fan</a>, and spotted by <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/braid-anniversary-edition-has-sold-like-dog-sht-creator-jonathan-blow-says/">VGC</a>.
</p>
<p>When asked if the remaster had sold well 34 days after the release of the Anniversary Edition, Blow responded, "No, it sold horribly."

<p>"Well, it depends on what your standards are. If you compare it to nostalgic things, like the Jeff Minter game that's on Steam, or Atari 50, it's sold much better than all of those. But it has still sold like dog shit compared to what we need to make for the company to survive.
</p>
<p>"The future is uncertain, let's put it that way," he added.
</p>
<p>Blow answered the question similarly 68 and 74 days after release, calling sales "utterly terrible."
</p>
<p>Although sales haven't been great, Blow seems happy with the game they produced, at least. "At some point, you just have to know that what you did was a good thing even if the world doesn't really acknowledge it and this is one of those cases I think."
</p>
<p>First released in 2008, Braid was a critically acclaimed puzzle-platformer pioneer based around the player's ability to manipulate time. Braid: Anniversary Edition remasters the game with fully recreated artwork and over 15 hours of developer commentary. It's the first game released by Blow's company, Thekla, since first-person puzzler The Witness in 2016.

<p>Guy ‘Dr Disrespect’ Beahm has been silent on social media since kicking off an extended vacation over a month ago. The untimely departure followed the surfacing of allegations that he had messaged a minor in 2017, an event that eventually led to his permanent ban from Twitch. He has since owned up to the wrongdoing – but not before he lost sponsorship deals, assignments, and almost 100,000 followers online.</p>



<p>Just now, Dr Disrespect posted on social media for the first time in five weeks, proving that he’s already up to his old tricks.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-not-those-tricks">Not <em>Those </em>Tricks</h2>



<p>On Twitter, Dr Disrespect posted an image today showing him playing chess against someone playing checkers. It was a shot loaded with thinly veiled meaning, suggesting that he’s playing a much more complex game in the shadows while we’re all at the board playing something much simpler.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>It’s indicative of Dr Disrespect’s narcissistic personality traits, which he has become known for over the last decade or so of streaming.</p>



<p>Soon enough, the ‘Two Time’ had kicked off his staple trend of being a brash loudmouth, firing back at some critics in the comments of his post, referencing one being ‘woke’ and poking fun at another user’s pronouns. Of course, this earned him a mixed response, with some die-hard fans rushing to his defence while others stuck more to the lines of ‘nobody wants you to come back’.</p>



<p>It’s not yet known how or when Dr Disrespect intends to return to streaming, or what’ll be waiting for him when he does. He has lost tens of thousands of followers in recent weeks, but he’s still way up there in the millions – and likely will remain so for quite some time.</p>
