			<p>Firaxis has launched the next update for Civilization VII, which has made some of the changes listed from the content roadmap that they released. Most of the content from the update are updates and suggestions that have been left by the community and the feedback provided. Below are some of the highlights of the update.</p>
<p>First is the new Natural Wonder that all players will be able to discover for free, which is the Bermuda Triangle. Cross-play between PC and consoles will also be re-enabled when this update releases. The update includes UI adjustments and addressing reported issues from the dedicated community.</p>
<p>For those that manage to make it to the Modern Age, there have now been some major changes to the Modern Age's Cultural Legacy Path and Victory, as AI leaders have now been given a better opportunity at completing a Cultural Victory. This means that players can expect to see fewer Explorer Unit stacks scattered across the map.</p>
<p>Those going for a Religious Victory will now be able to convert Holy Cities in the Exploration Age. When players create their own Missionary Units, they will automatically follow the player's chosen Religion.</p>
<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/how-to/how-to-disperse-an-independent-power-in-civilization-7/">Dispersing Independent Powers</a> is a large part of Civilization VII, and previously, land units were the only ones able to disperse them. Now, Naval Units will be able to disperse Coastal Independent Powers, which can be incredibly helpful if you don't have units in that area.</p>
<p>Along with this update, it's announced that the first in-game event that was planned for Civilization VII will instead be postponed to a later update. This includes future events as well, with them all taking a backseat so that the developers can focus on prioritizing quality-of-life improvements for players worldwide.</p>
<p>After today's update, there will then be another major update taking place this month, with Update 1.1.1 of Civilization VII slated for March 25 (subject to change). This will add in the Quick Move functionality, as well as the ability to customize the names of Commanders and Cities and a new Natural Wonder, which is available to all players.</p>
<p>Looking even further into the future, the developers are planning on adding new map sizes for all platforms except Nintendo Switch, mod tools and Steam Workshop support, and further customizations that can be made to a player's game.</p>
<p>If you want the nitty-gritty of each change made in today's update to Civilization VII, or any future updates, you can find the information on the <a href="https://civilization.2k.com/civ-vii/news/civ-vii-update-check-in-feb-27/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">official Civilization VII website</a>.</p>

			<p>Today, Sony has announced the new PlayStation Beta program. You may remember participating in previous limited-time beta programs for various system updates for PlayStation consoles, but this will be a unified Beta program going forward. Sony says it will be an easier, more consolidated way for gamers to sign up for future beta testing across a wide range of PlayStation experiences.</p>
<p>With a single sign-up to the Beta Program at PlayStation, users may register their interest in testing access to participating games for the PlayStation 5 console and PC, new PS5 console features, PlayStation App features, and even user experience features on the official PlayStation website. Interested users only need to register to be considered for all these different betas, and if they receive an invitation to a specific beta, it's of course up to them to decide whether to take part.</p>
<p>Here are the requirements:</p>
<ul>
<li>Players must have a valid PlayStation Network account in good standing with a current email address. Accounts with restrictions or violations may not be eligible.</li>
<li>Players must live in the region where the PlayStation Beta program is available on PlayStation. For example, it is not yet available in Italy, as well as likely in many other countries across the world at this time.</li>
<li>Players must be of legal age in their region.</li>
<li>It's free to join, and registration is open worldwide from today <a href="http://playstation.com/beta-program-at-playstation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">at this address</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Sony also clarifies that sometimes there simply may be more interest than they can accommodate. Joining the PlayStation Beta program will allow you to be considered for beta participation, but it doesn't guarantee that you will be selected for a beta test.</p>

            <p>
Monolith Productions co-founder Jace Hall has expressed a strong interest in remaking rancid horror game <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/condemned-criminal-origins">Condemned: Criminal Origins</a> and its sequel, Condemned 2: Bloodshot. It's not entirely clear how he'd do this, given that Monolith <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/warner-bros-close-monolith-creators-of-fear-condemned-shadow-of-mordor-and-wonder-woman">no longer exists even as a brand name</a>, following cuts at parent company Warner Bros Interactive Entertainment, and that Hall himself doesn't seem to be directly involved with game development or publishing these days. That said, he <em>is</em> the sole current owner of the Condemned intellectual property. So if a remake is going to happen, it'll need to happen through him.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
All this comes in the form of a single tweet, following a grieving Monolith fan's request to "make the Condemned 1 &amp; 2 Remake &amp; quite f**king around". Hall <a href="https://x.com/JaceHall/status/1896149517063663708">responded</a>: "I will see what may be possible. Absolutely no promises. Please have ZERO expectations. This will take me some time."
</p>
<p>
Hall left Monolith in 2003 - two years before Criminal Origins launched on Xbox 360 - to work in an executive role at Warner. While at Warner, he co-led plans for a Condemned connected universe, spilling into the realm of film, but these ambitions never quite came to fruition. Hall departed Warner in 2008 to work at a string of outfits broadly concerned with game-as-service business models, entertainment production and esports. 
</p>
<p>
Even as he has moved between roles, however, Hall hasn't forgotten about Condemned. Back in 2015, he <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150726144727/https://www.facebook.com/JaceHallShow/posts/10152999663109303">wrote on Facebook</a> that "I am consistently asked when a third game might be created" and that he is "contemplating finding an interested and proven Indie development team AND PROVIDING IT TO THEM, so that they can take over the franchise and move it forward".
</p>
<p>
Speaking to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2015/02/04/condemned-3-would-be-made-without-interference-or-limitations">Ian Games</a> subsequently, Hall reiterated that: "I am going to grant a license to use the Condemned franchise in general, and the chosen developer will be able to pick what kind of game they want to make. They can choose their vision of the content. They can build up momentum. Perhaps a prequel. Perhaps a simple mobile phone app for starters. It's all on the table. I'm open to hearing new ideas."
</p>
<p>
Would you like Condemned to return? I think Criminal Origins is <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-horror-games">a well-crafted horror game</a> with excellently vicious and antsy melee combat, but "well-crafted", here, risks being a justification for the fantasy of playing a cop who beats up homeless people and addicts with a pipe. That the cop's victims have been mutated and driven berserk by a sci-fantasy McGuffin doesn't really counter the argument that the game actively channels hatred towards the less fortunate, though Monolith are hardly the only horror game developers to do this.</p>
<p>I'm not sure which game developer I'd trust to bring Condemned back. I guess the quickfix corrective optics would be to turn the tables and have you fight a bunch of deranged and screaming police.

                <p>Ubisoft's Far Cry multiplayer extraction shooter game has reportedly been rebooted as the game--once intended as part of Far Cry 7--has had developers shifted over to the latter game.</p><p>According to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/far-cry-multiplayer-rebooted/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Insider Gaming</a>, Ubisoft moved developers from working on the multiplayer game, called Project Maverick, over to Project Blackbird, which is Far Cry 7. This was reportedly done in December in order to make sure the development of Blackbird stayed on track.</p><p>The decision to reboot Maverick remains unclear, but it was reportedly due to Ubisoft's recent initiative to streamline development <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-and-tencent-could-create-a-new-venture-as-part-of-major-change/1100-6528824/" data-ref-id="1100-6528824">as it deals with its financial issues</a>. Ubisoft Montreal, the studio leading Maverick and Blackbird, will reportedly take the former back to Ubisoft Sherbrooke for more prototyping.</p><p>Another branch, Ubisoft Berlin, was also reportedly helping out with Maverick, but has seen more of its developers moved over to Blackbird as well as a different project.</p><p>It's unclear when Maverick will be ready for launch. However, some developers reportedly feel confident that Blackbird could still launch in 2026. Playtesting for Blackbird has reportedly already begun, and the feedback was positive, with testers reportedly saying that the game "played great" and apparently changed the traditional Far Cry formula in some ways, including its movement mechanics.</p><p>Maverick was reportedly set in Alaska, at least initially, with players having to survive against harsh weather, wild animals, soldiers, and other players.</p><p>Ubisoft is going through a tumultuous time as it has been <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-closes-studio-eliminating-185-jobs-in-latest-round-of-cuts/1100-6529036/" data-ref-id="1100-6529036">closing studios and conducting multiple rounds of layoffs</a>. Ubisoft is also <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-doubles-down-on-open-world-and-live-service-games/1100-6529497/" data-ref-id="1100-6529497">doubling down on open-world and live-service games</a>, and it sounds like Blackbird and Maverick both fit these templates.</p>

            <p>After <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tony-hawks-pro-skater-announcement-teased-in-call-of-duty-black-ops-6s-latest-map">plenty of whispers and speculation</a>, today Activision confirmed what we were all hoping for: <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/tony-hawks-pro-skater-3">Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3</a> and 4 are back, and getting remade from the ground up.</p>
<p>The upcoming combined remake will feature new skaters (so, professional skateboarder Tyshawn Jones, who <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mystery-tony-hawk-remaster-now-mentioned-by-pro-skater-involved-in-the-game-even-though-activision-hasnt-announced-it-yet">let slip he was part of the game ahead of today's announcement</a>), as well as "gnarlier tricks, an even sicker soundtrack, and, for the first time in 10 years - brand-new parks". That soundtrack will include songs from the original games such as Ace of Spades by Motorhead, as well as new tracks which "capture the spirit of modern skate culture".</p>
<p>The game will also boast cross-platform online multiplayer for up to eight skaters.</p>

<p>"Developed with attention to detail by Iron Galaxy Studios and in collaboration with Tony Hawk and Activision, Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 + 4 picks up seamlessly right where the critically acclaimed <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/tony-hawks-pro-skater">Tony Hawk's Pro Skater</a> 1 and 2 game left off," the official blurb reads.</p>
<p>"Choose from a legendary pro skater roster that includes Tony Hawk, Bucky Lasek, Steve Caballero, Kareem Campbell, Geoff Rowley, Andrew Reynolds, Elissa Steamer, Chad Muska, Eric Koston, Rodney Mullen, Jamie Thomas, Rune Glifberg, and Bob Burnquist, or opt for the new skaters, including Rayssa Leal, Chloe Covell, Jamie Foy, Zion Wright, and Yuto Horigome. And, in true Tony Hawk's Pro Skater fashion, there will be secrets to unlock."</p>
<p>Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 + 4 will be released across PlayStation 4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, PC (via Steam, Battle.net and Microsoft Store), and Nintendo Switch on 11th July. It will also be coming to Game Pass Ultimate and Game Pass PC.</p>
<p>If you are interested in getting your hands on Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 + 4, <a href="https://www.tonyhawkthegame.com/">you can pre-order now</a>. Those that do will gain access to the Foundry Demo coming in June (although, please note this demo will only be available across PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, and PC), as well as the Wireframe Tony Shader at launch.</p>

<p>If you choose to plump for either the Digital Deluxe and Collector's Edition, you will also get earlier access to the full game, beginning 8th July. The Digital Deluxe Edition of Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 + 4 will also give you access to other extras such as Doom Slayer and Revenant characters, in-game skate decks, Create-a-Skater items, and "more".</p>
<p>The Collector's Edition, meanwhile,  includes everything in the Digital Deluxe Edition, but also comes with a Limited-Edition full-size Birdhouse skateboard deck which has a printed Tony Hawk autograph.</p>

<p>Plans to give Pro Skater 3 and 4 the remake treatment were reportedly scrapped after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tony-hawks-pro-skater-1-2-studio-vicarious-visions-has-been-merged-into-blizzard">Activision made the decision to merge developer Vicarious Visions into Blizzard</a> in 2021. But, that clearly wasn't the end of it after all, and in September last year, Tony Hawk himself teased something was in the pipeline. More pertinently, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tony-hawk-has-been-talking-to-activision-again-as-pro-skater-25th-anniversary-looms">Hawk revealed he had been "talking to Activision again" last September</a>, and added these talks were " insanely exciting" and he was "working on something" with the studio.</p>
<p>So, are you ready to get back on your boards when Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 + 4 releases this summer?</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

He also has a fully charged Ultimate, letting you use the most powerful ability of any character being played. Double up on defensive ultimates, use a powerful offensive ultimate, then enjoy a few seconds playing as that character before reverting to Loki. Incredibly powerful and flexible, and one reason why Loki players have so much room for self-expression in how they play him.</p><p><strong>Regeneration Domain</strong> (LB) - One of the most powerful abilities in the entire game, Regeneration Domain spawns at your feet and those of each of your Doppelgangers. It reverses damage, converting it to healing, meaning it can completely negate enemy Ultimates and a wide range of attacks. Because of this, you can save an enemy across the map by spawning a Doppelganger next to them and activating the Domain. Incredibly powerful and worth more than its weight in gold. <em>(Can game moves have mass? -Ed)</em></p><p><strong>Doppelganger</strong> (Right Click / RB) - The key to Loki’s movement and enemy confusion. Creates a duplicate of himself which will remain immobile but imitate his actions. Because of this, it’s best to stand still when trying to confuse enemies, since only the <em>real </em>Loki could be strafing and jumping around. Attacks from Doppelgangers still deal damage to enemies and heal allies, so you always want to have two (the maximum) Doppelgangers out.</p><p><strong>Devious Exchange</strong> (B / Circle) - Switches places with whichever Doppelganger you are looking at. A fantastic way to move around the map, avoid enemy attacks, or get closer to the action. Always keep them guessing.</p><p><strong>Backstab</strong> (R3) - Loki has a melee attack, and it (appropriately) does more damage when attacking from behind. Remind them all how much betrayal stings.</p><p><strong>Deception</strong> (LT) - Turn invisible until you turn it off. A glorious way to avoid enemies, and it creates a Doppelganger at the location where you first activated it, making it a way to jump-start your duplicitous ‘shell game.’</p><p><strong>Laufeyson Reborn</strong> (Team-Up Ability: Y / Triangle) - Teaming up with Hela, Loki can be revived instantly if Hela gets a final blow while you are respawning. If you are still alive, you get Bonus Health instead. Nice bonus to playing with Hela.</p><h2 id="h478222"><a id=""></a><strong>How Should I Play Loki?</strong></h2><p>Loki has an incredibly high ceiling, but he is also a competent healer and damager even without optimizing your trickery. For starters, make sure you always have two Doppelgangers out when engaging in battle. The clones will fire at your targets from wherever they are, meaning you can easily triangulate, sniping from upper angles (hitting enemies over walls and other obstructions), and healing allies from great distances.</p><figure id="" data-id="dea6ec84d37e4395127d1232d55e9bbd" data-recommend-id="image://dea6ec84d37e4395127d1232d55e9bbd" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Lots of Lokis and healing circles." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Lots of Lokis and healing circles." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->NetEase / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="dea6ec84d37e4395127d1232d55e9bbd" data-recommend-id="image://dea6ec84d37e4395127d1232d55e9bbd" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Lots of Lokis and healing circles." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Keep Regeneration Domain available, as it is (effectively) an “I Win” ability when used against powerful offensive enemy Ultimates. If enemy Duelists are flanking you, they’ll also be forced to retreat as they realize how futile their attacks are, and how formidable you and your clones are at fighting back while invincible.</p><p>The only exception are enemies like Spider-Man and Winter Soldier, who have abilities that can move you. If they can push or pull you out of your healing circle, it’s game over, so take them out first, or keep a teammate close.</p><p>If you have an Ultimate charged, you can turn the tables by transforming into them and using it, but make sure you have learned their abilities and Ultimates and what they do, or you’ll be making a quick trip to the Respawn Room.</p><p>Experiment with spawning clones on top of buildings, then swapping places with them, to reach truly bizarre locations to snipe and heal from. A skilled Loki can carry their team to victory with a powerful and versatile set of skills that can adapt to nearly any situation. He also rewards creative thinking in a way few other characters can.</p><hr><p>I may be playing the God of Lies, but you can (probably) trust me.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/civilization-7-update-110-patch-notes<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Firaxis and 2K have released&nbsp;<em>Civilization 7&nbsp;</em>Update 1.1.0, the game's first major update, and it's got plenty of improvements and balance tweaks to hopefully improve your experience with the game.</p>

<p>First up, Firaxis says it's made some tweaks to the Geographic Society victory condition, improving "how this victory feels and plays". It should no longer be quite as easy to "breeze through this path when no other players are aiming for this victory".</p>

<p>Changes to this effect include Explorer units costing more, fewer Exploration Age artifacts spawning per continent, and the ability to study Natural Wonders for Artifacts, plus more.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/civilization-7-update-1.1.0-france.jpg?itok=eL8JDdx8 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/civilization-7-update-1.1.0-france.jpg?itok=oRL0tS8_ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The first major&nbsp;<em>Civilization 7&nbsp;</em>update is here.</figcaption></figure><p>There are, of course, tons of other changes to both the PC and console versions of&nbsp;<em>Civilization 7</em>. On the PC side, these changes include improvements to the game's AI and various systems, as well as improvements for its UI.</p>

<p>Console changes are also pretty extensive, with many smaller changes to UI, gameplay systems, and more. You can check out the full patch notes for&nbsp;<em>Civilization 7&nbsp;</em>Update 1.1.0 <a href="https://civilization.2k.com/civ-vii/game-update-notes/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">right here</a>.</p>

<p>Whether or not this is enough to placate players who <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/civilization-7-early-access-mixed-reviews-50k-players" rel="nofollow">still feel angry</a> about&nbsp;<em>Civilization 7</em>'s launch remains to be seen. Last month, Firaxis <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/civilization-7-ui-problems-fixes-coming" rel="nofollow">promised to address</a> players' common criticisms of the game, so let's hope the UI improvements in this update are a good start, at least.</p>

<p>The first half of&nbsp;<em>Civilization 7</em>'s inaugural paid DLC pack has gone live as part of this update as well, and it includes a new Leader, two new Civilizations, and new Natural Wonders. Again, though, you will have to pay to enjoy that stuff.</p>




<p><em>Civilization 7&nbsp;</em>is the latest mainline installment in the&nbsp;<em>Civilization&nbsp;</em>series of turn-based strategy games. It includes a new Age system to more clearly demarcate time periods, as well as changes to city-building, diplomacy, and more.</p>

<p>You can check&nbsp;<em>Civilization 7&nbsp;</em>out right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1295660/Sid_Meiers_Civilization_VII/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/sid-meier-s-civilization-vii/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/sid-meiers-civilization-vii-for-xbox-series-xs/9N23HJHSC6BL" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/sid-meiers-civilization-vii-switch/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch</a>.

<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/sid-meiers-civilization">Sid Meier's Civilization</a> 7 has a new Sid Meier's game update that makes changes to Sid Meier's user interface, leader AI, Age mechanics, Mementos and naval unit handling. Developers Firaxis have also stirred in a free bonus Natural Wonder, Sid Meier's Bermuda Triangle.</p>
<p>Leaving aside for the moment the on-going arguments about whether (Sid Meier's - OK, enough of that now) Civilization 7 is an unambiguous low point for the series, or yet another flawed 4X <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy</a> sim that will find its feet via post-launch updates, I love the idea of a Bermuda Triangle just popping up in my simulation, like a black hole spawning in my fridge. I hope it works as in legends about the real-life Bermuda Triangle (or in the previous <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/sid-meiers-civilization-vi">Civilization 6</a>), with whole armies and fleets getting swallowed up in transit and/or scattered across the globe at random.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
Formally titled Update 1.1.0, the patch is reportedly based on “community suggestions and feedback”. It’s live today and – <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/upcoming-civilization-vii-expansion-release-dates-seemingly-leaked-by-nintendo">as rumoured last week</a> - accompanies the first part of the paid Crossroads Of The World DLC Collection, which features a new leader, Ada Lovelace, the new civs Great Britain (in the Modern Age) and Carthage (in Antiquity), and a Natural Wonder pack with four more Natural Wonders: Machapuchare, Mount Fuji, Vihren, and Vinicunca.
</p>
<p>
The developers had planned to launch Civilization 7’s first in-game Event, Natural Wonder Battle, alongside the update, but “events are now being postponed to a later update to allow us more time to prioritize quality-of-life improvements for players worldwide”. 
</p>
<p>
Here’s a PR-supplied highlights reel for Update 1.1.0. 
</p>
<blockquote><p>
- New Natural Wonder to discover: Bermuda Triangle (free to all players)
</p>
<p>
- Additional UI adjustments, polish, and addressing of reported issues
</p>
<p>
- Significant changes to the Modern Age's Cultural Legacy Path and Victory; AI leaders will also be better at completing a Cultural Victory (so expect fewer Explorer Unit stacks!)
</p>
<p>
- Now able to convert Holy Cities in the Exploration Age. Note that when players create their own Missionary Units, they will always follow the player’s chosen Religion
</p>
<p>
- Naval Units will be able to disperse Coastal Independent Powers
</p>
<p>
- Balance pass on several Mementos
</p>
<p>
- Refinements to the Army Unpacking action
</p>
<p>
- Addressing reported issues with multiplayer and adding friends with a 2K Account
</p>
<p>
- For console players: all prior updates from Update 1.0.1 Patches 1, 2, and 3 will be implemented, in addition to the items noted above
</p></blockquote>
<p>
There’s another Civ 7 patcheroo on the way on 25th March, called Update 1.1.1. It introduces Mount Everest as a free Natural Wonder, adds quick move functionality, and tinkers further with the AI, amongst other things. It's timed to accompany the second half of the aforesaid Crossroads Of The World DLC, which adds another new leader, Simón Bolívar, together with Nepal (Modern Age) and Bulgaria (Exploration Age). Here’s a breakdown in advance:
</p>
<blockquote><p>
- Additional UI improvements and refinements; specifics will be shared later with the Update 1.1.1 Notes. Note: Ongoing improvements to the User Interface continues to be a top priority for the development team. The updates being introduced on March 25 are just one part of a much larger plan that aims to improve the UI over the next several months. 
</p>
<p>
- Scouting and Settling improvements for AI, including less aggressive “forward” settling by AI
</p>
<p>
- Adding Quick Move functionality
</p>
<p>
- Adding the ability to customize the names of Commanders and Cities
</p>
<p>
- Renaming the existing maps to be "Start Position: Balanced," which will be the default Start Position setting for multiplayer games
</p>
<p>
- Adding a new Start Position of "Standard," where the landforms on maps are less predictable, closer to how map generation works in Civ VI
</p>
<p>
- Adding an optional Restart button that rerolls the player’s map generation now that these less predictable start positions are possible
</p>
<p>
- New Natural Wonder: Mount Everest (free to all players)
</p></blockquote>
<p>
In our fashionably late <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/sid-meiers-civilization-vii-review">Civilization 7 review</a>, Actual Game Designer Greg Costikyan concluded that “despite its flaws, Civilization 7 sustains that “one more turn!” desire to plow through history and see what happens next.” I am certainly interested to see what happens next with Civ 7. Going by site stats, you are all very intrigued by it, despite some cogent and withering assessments of its failings.

                <p>Capcom's Monster Hunter Wilds launched on February 28 and became a smashing success out of the gate, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/monster-hunter-wilds-becomes-capcoms-fastest-selling-game-in-just-3-days/1100-6529838/" data-ref-id="1100-6529838">selling 8 million copies in three days to become Capcom's fastest-selling game ever</a>. The launch hasn't gone entirely smoothly, though, as players have reported a number of issues. The <a href="https://www.monsterhunter.com/support/wilds/en/faq/detail/060" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Monster Hunter Wilds website</a> lists off some of what's been fixed so far, and there have been many changes.</p><p>Some of the issues that have been fixed so far include the fix for the "Grill a Meal" and "Ingredient Center" features not working properly, along with a fix for tutorials being repeatedly shown at the Smithy. Capcom also fixed an issue that could cause the game to force-quit and addressed an issue where the weapon equipment skill would be mistakenly activated when using a mantle.</p><div tabindex="0"

                <p dir="ltr">Today marks the 25th anniversary of PS2, the best-selling video game console of all time. Sony released the home system in Japan on March 4, 2000, and one Redditor flew over to Tokyo at that time to buy one.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1j395wt/25_years_ago_i_flew_to_japan_to_buy_a_playstation/" rel="nofollow ">On Reddit</a>, user YomReddit shared a post with four pictures showing his adventure to Akihabara in 2000 to pick up a PS2 at launch. The Redditor added that they waited 26 hours in line outside a Tokyo store to grab the Sony system. Previously, YomReddit celebrated the console's 20-year anniversary in a similar manner <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/fd96pg/on_this_day_20_years_ago_i_queued_for_26_hours_in/" rel="nofollow ">on Reddit</a>. In the comments, the Redditor noted they were from England and played Japanese games since the PS2 was region-locked.</p><p dir="ltr">The PS2 was originally unveiled at the Tokyo Game Show in September 1999, according to <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/playstation-history/2000-ps2-psp/">the PlayStation website</a>. A couple of the first games showcased for the system included Gran Turismo 3: A-Spec (though it wasn't named this at the time) and Eternal Ring, developed by Elden Ring studio From Software.</p><p dir="ltr">The PS2 didn't launch in North America until October 26, 2000, while the European release was even later on November 24, 2000. Worldwide launches were not common for consoles or games at that time. Ultimately, over 160 million PS2 systems were sold globally, a record that still stands today. Nintendo DS ended its lifecycle with more than 154 million units sold, while <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-selling-nintendo-platforms-of-all-time-and-how-many-units-they-sold/2900-5124/" data-ref-id="2900-5124">Switch sits at 150 million consoles sold</a>, so Nintendo's hybrid system still has a chance to topple the PS2.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-30th-anniversary-kicks-off-with-nostalgic-ps5-themes-and-the-cranberries/1100-6528157/" data-ref-id="1100-6528157">Sony has also been celebrating PlayStation's 30th anniversary</a> recently. For instance, PS5 users got a PS2 theme along with other PlayStation menu looks for a limited time. The original PlayStation launched in Japan on December 3, 1994, with the North American release happening on September 9, 1995.</p>

		<p>Firaxis has released Update 1.1.0 for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/civilzation-7">Civilization 7</a>, the patch bringing the first batch of UI improvements to the game, some AI adjustments and adding a new Natural Wonder to discover.</p>
<p>The update is out now across all platforms, PC and consoles, bringing their versions back into alignment as the console update also incorporates changes from hotfix patches 1, 2, and 3. Cross-play has also now been re-enabled.</p>


<p>In general, Firaxis has sought to address <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/07/firaxis-highlights-three-areas-theyll-improve-civilization-7-after-mixed-launch-reviews/">some of the main complaints that players of the game have had</a>, with the UI having come in for a lot of stick at launch. This is the first step for UI improvements that will continue with Update 1.1.1 later this month and through to further updates. For this update there’s things like fixing unit tooltips to remain within screen bounds, making scrollbars work when scrolling with a wheel, updates to the Leader Attribute Menu, and lots of other small tweaks to generally try and improve the UI.</p>
<p>There’s also AI improvements, so they’re able to better aim for a Cultural Victory – these have been overhauled for the Modern Age in general – a balance pass on Mementos, and fixes for converting Holy Cities in the Exploration Age.</p>
<p>Free for all players is the new Natural Wonder to discover, the Bermuda Triangle.</p>

<p>Here’s the PC patch notes for Civilization 7 Update 1.1.0 – <a href="https://civilization.2k.com/civ-vii/game-update-notes/">head here for console</a>:</p>

</ul>
<h2>Gameplay</h2>
<h3>AI</h3>
<ul>
<li>AI will now perform better at completing the Modern Cultural Legacy Path, by gaining Artifacts from Natural Wonders, researching at Museums/Universities, completing Civics, etc. (No more AI explorer stacks of doom!)</li>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dead-by-daylight-to-lose-hellraisers-cenobite-next-month.1124955/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dead-by-daylight-hellraiser-chapter-leaving<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Behaviour Interactive has announced that&nbsp;<em>Dead by Daylight&nbsp;</em>will soon lose one of its killers in the form of Pinhead, the iconic Cenobite villain from Clive Barker's horror movie&nbsp;<em>Hellraiser</em>.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://deadbydaylight.com/news/hellraiser-last-chance-sale/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on its website, Behaviour says that since&nbsp;<em>Dead by Daylight&nbsp;</em>is a live service game, it's prone to "unexpected changes", and that the loss of the game's <i>Hellraiser&nbsp;</i>Chapter, which includes Pinhead and a number of other items, is one such change.</p>

<p>You'll no longer be able to purchase Pinhead or any of the associated cosmetics starting from April 4th at 11am Eastern (that's 8am Pacific and around 4pm GMT).</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dead-by-daylight-cenobite-leaving-outfits.jpg?itok=Z5Ma8QpS 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dead-by-daylight-cenobite-leaving-outfits.jpg?itok=NYXhfBd1 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Dead by Daylight</em>'s Pinhead and his associated cosmetics will be leaving the game next month.</figcaption></figure><p>If you already happen to own the Cenobite Chapter, you'll still be able to access and play as Pinhead, and you'll also still retain access to your cosmetics and perks.</p>

<p>However, if you don't already own the Chapter, Pinhead's associated perks will be released to the general perk pool and will undergo a name change, with associated charms and achievements also being updated to reflect said change.</p>

<p>This isn't the first time characters from a major horror franchise have departed&nbsp;<em>Dead by Daylight</em>; back in 2021, the Demogorgon and other&nbsp;<em>Stranger Things&nbsp;</em>characters were <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dead-by-daylight-stranger-things-sale-has-big-discounts-for-crossover-characters" rel="nofollow">removed from the game's store</a>.</p>

<p>Two years later, Behaviour <a href="https://deadbydaylight.com/news/stranger-things-chapter-returns/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">reintroduced</a>&nbsp;<em>Stranger Things&nbsp;</em>characters and cosmetics to&nbsp;<em>Dead by Daylight</em>, so hey - maybe there's hope for Pinhead and the Chatterer yet. Let's hope so.</p>




<p>Pinhead isn't leaving&nbsp;<em>Dead by Daylight&nbsp;</em>until April, so if you do happen to want to pick up his Chapter and you haven't already done so, Behaviour is holding a sale right now that slashes 50% off the game's&nbsp;<em>Hellraiser</em>&nbsp;stuff.</p>
