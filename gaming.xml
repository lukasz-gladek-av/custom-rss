            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>Europa Universalis V starts as it means to go on, dropping you into its recreation of the late Middle Ages just as England and France embark on their Hundred Years’ War and then as the Black Death washes through Europe. To that backdrop, whatever nation you choose to play as is going to have a pretty rough time of it early on, but that just breeds opportunity through the 500 years of human history this ambitious game looks to portray.</p>
<p><iframe title="Here's Everything You Need To Know Before You Unpause Europa Universalis V" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/iA0cMW6QjDY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>But who do you choose to play as? If you’re coming from EU4, chances are you’ve already got a good idea, but for new players (or for the terminally indecisive) Paradox has a few handy suggestions, leaning into particular playstyles, such as the initially more expansionist tone of Hungary, the political focus of Norway, or the burgeoning trading nation of Holland. Unless you click it away, you’ll find yourself in a tailored opening experience with guiding tutorials through some of the key pillars and concepts within the game, and building certain mission paths.</p>


<p>There’s no getting away from just how dense Europa Universalis V remains, and it doesn’t help that some of the suggestions in the tutorial and the rigidity of the subsequent missions feel like they’re actively hindering your potential. That’s especially true of goals that target improvements, such as adding four buildings to your capital or increasing Control through a region –&nbsp;if you’ve already pushed those metrics quite high, it makes that mission tree more arduous than it should be. You can’t do multiple mission trees at once, and you lose progress if you switch to another.</p>
<p>Thankfully, the foundational work that Paradox has put in with the nested tooltips, the in-game search, and encyclopaedia all go a long way to helping pick up the slack… mostly. There’s still plenty of times where it won’t be quite clear why you can’t build that particular building just yet, or there’s a new term that your Renaissance Googling won’t quite dredge up, or maybe you’ve just found a search bar in the wrong section… But you’re in this for the long haul, and like a spotty 16-year old who’s been hurriedly handed a crown and told to go make an heir, you’ll figure it out – OK, that’s a bit more <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/08/31/crusader-kings-iii-review/">Crusader Kings</a> than Europa Universalis, but you know what I mean.</p>


<p>Even as a series veteran, there’s plenty of new, returning, and modified concepts to get to grips with. Trade, for example, now hinges on a system of established markets to funnel all of a region’s imports, exports, resources, and production through – this isn’t based on nations, but literally the proximity and influence of the markets themselves. You can happily use the established flow of trade through the world to flog your wares and feed your economy, but there’s also benefits to being in control, and so you can make the investment to found a market of your own to try and grow your stature.</p>
<p>All of that trade is, of course, built off the backs of your people, your “pops”, and the provinces they inhabit. This is the real lifeblood of your nation, with each province (and there’s so many more vs. EU4) having a key resource assigned that can be gathered, mined, hunted, and farmed through an RGO (the very technically correct Resource Gathering Operation), alongside whatever buildings you’re able to construct for your town, city, or countryside. Pops are your units, each with their key culture, religion, and social position, needs, and preferences. Peasants are at the bottom rung, below Labourers, the increasingly wealthy Burghers, then the Nobility and the Aristocracy, with religious leaders having their own special place alongside, each represented by an Estate in your government. You need people of the right class to work the specific jobs, and so there’s some social mobility here even early on, but as you progress through the ages, that grows and shifts.</p>

<p>You are, in some ways, as much at the whims of the pops, as they are to your desires to reshape your nation along twelve Societal Values scales. You might want to build up the cities with tons of growing industries and technological advances, but people really don’t like change, whether that’s the nobility wanting to maintain all their power and serfs, or country folk not wanting everything to be so centralised around stinky towns. There’s a constant push and pull to societal change, as you need to appease each Estate by giving them privileges to give nuggets of power and influence in exchange for enabling your Reforms. On a smaller scale, individual pops can be dissatisfied, and you need to maintain stability, using this as a currency to enact change. Some of that can come from buildings, but there’s also tasking your Cabinet with tipping the balance in a particular category, making choices at key junctures, and enacting laws as their concepts become available. It’s always handy to have a fair amount of Crown Power to push this through.</p>
<p>Another key metric is Control, an indication of how “close” your provinces are to your centre of power –&nbsp;a bit like those mud farmers in Monty Python not knowing who their king is. It’s vital for you to be able to dredge up taxes and manpower for your military, as lower control drops your reach in a province. It’s simple, and it’s clear, and the two simplest ways to improve it are to build roads and use your Cabinet to increase control in a region, but there’s other ways to boost it as well.</p>

<p>Given the 500 year span of the campaign, there’s an awful lot of development of cultures, ideas and technology, and this is broken down into six distinct ages. Each of these has three core concepts that need to reach your borders, slowly spreading across the world from their point of origin, and then needing you to invest in that category before you can start to research – this costs more, the lower nascent awareness your pops have. The tech trees are big and broad, branching out from an initial innovation to a bunch of Advances, and the UI for this is a massively zoomed out sideways scrolling mess, but it’s conceptually a good way to gate and reveal each age’s advances. The sticking plaster is that there’s also a list of available Advances, that you can search for a particular thing you need and queue up the whole chain, and just offload to an AI manager.</p>
<p>And you can do that a lot in this game. AI has been laced into so many aspects of Europa Universalis V that you can almost put the game in autopilot to run itself but, really, I appreciate that this is present, it feels like it does a competent job, and I can always dive in and tinker as well. It allows trading to be massively granular, making deals with two decimal points for market needs while I just pop in to maybe set out some bigger ones. It’s a great tool both for beginners and for removing some of the busywork, and it can be applied as specifically or as broadly as you like.</p>
<p>With such an early start date to EU5, this really pushes the colonialist expansion side of a campaign much further. Depending on the nation that you choose to play as – I went with Holland for an economic play mainly – this can be your opportunity to really spread your wings when you’ve got major powers like France and England greedily gobbling up territory and vassals right next to you. The thing it, this is now tens of hours into the game, and if you’re a bit pigeonholed that can lead to long stretches of waiting.</p>

<p>So what to do but to lash out with some good old fashioned wars? I like the way that wars and combat are balanced in EU5. The tangle of alliances and defensive pacts can keep a lot of excessive aggression in check, and when fighting does break out, the AI is fairly smart in how it attacks you and uses multiple armies –&nbsp;though you can still outwit them if they get hung up on long sieges. Armies are arranged into three channels –&nbsp;a centre and two flanks –&nbsp;and you can toy with this a little to gain an advantage before combat begins.</p>
<p>All of this review, and I’ve barely scratched the surface of many of EU5’s depths and breadths. There’s an impressive amount in this game – the number of nations, cultural tweaks and world events are huge – and the core workings are very capable to encapsulating so much of this. I’ve no doubt that there’s balancing and tweaking that will occur once the game is in the hands of the masses, and the more overpowered and underpowered nations and playstyles will be brought into line.</p>
<p>But a final, special note for the presentation of this game. Visually, this is a nice evolution of Paradox’s Clausewitz Engine: there’s the pleasing way that towns and cities sprawl, how the overlay flattens the map and recedes, and the UI is pleasingly textured and thematic… but it’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OLdEOqfEouw">Håkan Glänte’s soundtrack</a> that will burrow its way into your mind. It certainly leans toward the breadth of later classical music eras, but folds earlier instrumentation and styles into the mix, and recalls motifs from previous games as well. Overture II: The Odyssey swells with optimism, Pain Is Salvation boasts rich and dramatic choral work, and Battle of Lützen is a suitably epic accompaniment to wartime, and on and on. For music that will join you for tens and hundreds of hours, I’m definitely not sick of it yet.</p>

			<p>It's Halloween at the time of this writing, which means it's the perfect day to turn off the lights and play a horror game, whether that's something new like Cronos: The New Dawn and Silent Hill f, or a classic like Amnesia: The Dark Descent, Dead Space, and Alien: Isolation. Developer Broken Mirror Games and publisher Skybound Games' upcoming isometric 80s-themed horror adventure was unfortunately never going to be an option this Halloween, <a href="https://wccftech.com/i-hate-this-place-release-date-ps5-xbox-nintendo-pc/">as it was due to come out on November 7, 2025</a>, but now it won't even be coming out this year.</p>



<p>A new story trailer released today shows off more of the game's spooky vibes, which is more than fitting for this time of year, but it ends with the revelation that the game will no longer make its November 7, 2025 date. Instead, it'll now release on PC, PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and Nintendo Switch on January 29, 2026.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>"<em>As for the date change, we decided that we need a little more time to better incorporate some changes and features gathered from community feedback</em>,<em>" </em>Broken Mirror Games wrote <a href="https://x.com/BMGhorrors/status/1984260318382658038">in a post on its official X (formerly Twitter) account</a>. "<em>We feel the game deserves to make a good first impression so we rethought things and set the new release window to January 2026. Thanks for your patience and understanding.</em>"</p>



<p>Broken Mirror Games' debut title is based on the comic book by writer Kyle Starks and artist Artyom Topilin, with players facing supernatural entities in this 80s-themed world. It was first showcased in <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2025/03/open-world-survival-horror-game-i-hate-this-place-announced-for-ps5-xbox-series-switch-and-pc">March 2025</a>, and prior to this delay, was expected to arrive sometime before the end of the year.</p>



<p>At least with its current release date, by the time we get to October 31, 2026, you'll probably be able to grab I Hate This Place as part of a spooky sale if you hadn't already picked it up. In the meantime, if you do want to check it out, there's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2604490/I_Hate_This_Place/">a demo currently available on PC</a> that was featured in the latest Steam Next Fest. </p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/advantage-wireless-controller-for-nintendo-switch-2-review/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/advantage-wireless-controller-for-nintendo-switch-2-review%E2%80%94pro-perfection-without-paying-full-price.1340587/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>On paper, the&nbsp;PowerA Advantage Wireless Controllers for the Nintendo Switch 2 seem like a more affordable way to enjoy the premium nuances of an official Nintendo Switch 2 Pro Controller. PowerA has always excelled at delivering classy imitators, all while adding its own signature flair through creative designs and licensed crossovers.</p>



<p>When I was asked to check out PowerA’s Advantage Wireless Controller lineup of Switch 2 Pro controllers, it was a no-brainer. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-production-pipeline-boost/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nintendo</a>‘s official accessories have always been notoriously expensive—it costs <strong>$89.99 for another set of Joy-Con 2 controllers</strong>, for example! If you’re worried about investing a lot of money into a third-party accessory or peripheral device, I’m here to tell you that your doubts are in vain. Read on for my full Advantage Wireless Controller Switch 2 Controller review.</p>



<h2 id="h-pro-kemon-gotta-catch-em-all">Pro-kemon, Gotta Catch ‘Em All!</h2>



<figure><figcaption>It looks utterly gorgeous. Credit to PowerA</figcaption></figure>



<p>From the box to the packaging to the controller itself, this feels like a premium product. The <a href="https://www.powera.com.au/collections/all" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PowerA</a> Advantage Wireless Controller is ‘Pro’ in every sense of the word. I reviewed the Pokémon: Mega Evolutions edition, but the range also features a more classic-looking ‘<strong>Black</strong>‘ design, in line with the actual Switch 2 Pro controller, and the more vibrant ‘<strong>Mario &amp; Friends</strong>‘ is a must-have for Mario fans. </p>



<p>As a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-first-year-revenue-estimates-hit-1-3-billion/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pokémon</a> connoisseur myself, I had to have Mega Evolutions. It’s simply incredible to look at. The front-facing design is compartmentalized into Lucario, Pikachu, and Mewtwo segments. They team up and intertwine to create a canvas of cohesive colors, and they’re presented on, in essence, a smooth-shaven controller surface—<strong>It’s the ASMR equivalent of sleek architecture</strong>. </p>



<p>The main Y, X, A, and B buttons have a nice purple finish to align with Mewtwo’s colors, and the top of the device—where a centrally-placed USB-C slot awaits—has a lovely yellow finish wrapped around the curved edges. The analog sticks are where your thumbs will be the majority of the time. A stark opposite to the Pro controller is having grippy barbs around each rubber stick. They add an extra layer of grip, and give you a feel of control that its more expensive contemporary could learn a thing or two from.</p>



<p>Lightweight is the best way to describe the controller, and it sits beautifully in my hands. The buttons are clicky and responsive, and my only real reservation about the design is that the <strong>controller’s main functionality buttons are all in a line along the bottom of the controller</strong>. I don’t think PowerA has done this with previous Switch controller designs. Throughout my playtime with the device, I often found myself trying to press the ‘+’ button, thinking it was in the middle of the controller, only to be met with empty space. Again, it’s the <em>only </em>minor inconvenience I’ve encountered with the design and presentation, and you get used to it after a while.</p>



<h2 id="h-pro-performance-across-the-board">Pro Performance Across The Board</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Spoilt for choice? Credit to PowerA</figcaption></figure>



<p>The PowerA Advantage Wireless Switch 2 Controller will cost you <strong>$69.99</strong>, compared to the more eye-watering <strong>$84.99</strong> of the official Nintendo Switch 2 Pro Controller. After countless hours with the Pokémon: Mega Evolutions controller, I don’t see any reason to pay the extra $15. Plus, you don’t get the novelty and variety of these bespoke designs.</p>



<p>In fact, the only major performance discrepancy of note is the <strong>battery life</strong>: You get roughly 40 hours for the official controller versus 30 hours with the PowerA model. It’s up to you if you think the extra money is worth a few more hours, but I charge my controller regularly, and I have immediate access to a USB-C cable next to the couch as a contingency for worst-case scenarios. </p>



<p><strong>PowerA has also thrown in a 10ft / 3m USB-C charging cable as a bonus.</strong></p>



<p>I tested the controller across a collection of my Switch games: Mario Kart World, Pokémon Scarlet, and Super Mario Party Jamboree. <strong>I experienced zero issues</strong>; the controller connected to my Switch 2 very quickly, and it behaves just like a Pro controller should. It also doesn’t skimp on the additional buttons, enabling you to reconfigure the controls. If you feel the X button is too far away for the game you’re playing and it’s compromising your playstyle, simply remap it to either of the GR/GL buttons.</p>



<p>The GR and GL buttons are present on the controller’s rear area of the handles, tucked inside. They sync up with your middle fingers and give you the liberty to tweak your setup. It also has real-time sensors and motion controls as standard—along with a C Button for Switch 2 GameChat.</p>



<h2 id="h-verdict">Verdict</h2>



<p>Unless another pro controller comes along that narrowly edges out the Pokémon: Mega Evolutions design, this is easily my new, full-time Nintendo Switch 2 controller moving forward. The analog sticks are unbelievably satisfying to use and tailor-made to cushion your thumbs. The overall design is smooth, simple, light, and feels satisfying to use. The controller’s performance is absolutely what it needs to be, and unless you want to pay a few more dollars for additional battery life, you can’t go wrong with any of the PowerA Advantage Wireless Controllers For Nintendo Switch 2.</p>



<p>I hope you enjoyed my Advantage Wireless Controller For Nintendo Switch 2 review. Let me know if you end up buying one of the controllers.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">With all the indie titles being released on Steam every week, it can be hard to make your game stand out. Italian developer Fix-a-Bug accidentally gave its 2D dungeon crawler a big prelaunch popularity boost in Japan by accidentally naming the game “Shitty Dungeon” in Japanese.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Although the game’s English title is The Crazy Hyper-Dungeon Chronicles, its Japanese language Steam Store page ended up displaying the title as Kuso Danjon. This means “Shitty Dungeon” or “Crap Dungeon,” if you want to be slightly more polite.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In a recent interview with <a href="https://www.gamespark.jp/article/2025/10/28/158848.html" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Game*Spark</u></a> spotted by <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/developer-who-accidentally-listed-game-as-shitty-dungeon-in-japan-says-steam-wishlists-skyrocketed-in-aftermath/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Automaton</u></a>, developer Paolo Nicoletti explained that the ‘shitty dungeon incident’ occurred back in August this year, when the team was releasing a demo version of the game and had yet to get a professional Japanese translation.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">When they realized their mistake, Nicoletti says, "Everyone was cracking up, and honestly, I also laughed a lot about it. It was completely unintentional.” However the mishap did not flush the rogue-lite dungeon crawler down the toilet, rather, “It ended up bringing the game a lot of attention and the number of Wishlists soared." Nicoletti said the name change was “the best accidental marketing” the developer could have hoped for.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">According to an earlier report by <a href="https://automaton-media.com/articles/newsjp/the-crazy-hyper-dungeon-20250814-353398/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Automaton Japan</u></a>, the Japanese language Steam page for The Crazy Hyper-Dungeon Chronicles was named Shitty Dungeon back on August 8. By August 13, Japanese speaking users had begun discussing the topic on X and had reported it on the official Discord server. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s still not clear how or why this mistranslation happened, but it’s worth noting that the pre-release Japanese language demo of the game had some awkward machine translations when it was picked for Tokyo Game Show’s ‘Selected Indie 80’ in September. The developers announced that these issues would be fixed in the full release, and it appears the ‘shitty dungeon incident’ occurred around this time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This amusing mistake made the indie game stand out from the crowd of new Steam releases. It soon became a topic of discussion on Japanese social media. According to Nicoletti, this contributed to an increase in Wishlist numbers for the then-unreleased game. After all, a title that seems to proudly proclaim it's bad can make people curious as to whether that’s really the case.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">However, the quality of the game did not stink after all, and The Crazy Hyper-Dungeon Chronicles currently has a '<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2510490/_/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Mostly Positive'</u></a> rating on Steam. Reviewers have been praising its funny dialogue, satisfying gameplay loop and the overall care put into its development. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Japanese speaking <a href="https://x.com/E2Rk85OLelnvHGG/status/1981349995816358273" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>commenters on X</u></a> have also praised the demo and the full game for being surprisingly better than its initial Japanese title suggested. “Humor that lives up to the name,” and “great, detailed pixel art,” are among the plaudits given to the indie title. One Japanese language <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198158461015/recommended/2510490/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>review</u></a> on Steam noted that, “Despite the title Shitty Dungeon making me think it was a joke, it is actually quite well made.” The reviewer said that because they'd made a blind buy, “It wasn’t quite what I expected but the combat system is pretty interesting.” They also praised the game’s balance between humorous dialogue and tense combat.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Although good localizations are preferable, translation errors have produced some weirdly memorable dialogue over the years. If it hadn’t been for mistranslation, such lines would never have become so iconic. Lines like Zero Wing’s “All your base are belong to us,” and Castlevania: Symphony of the Night’s “What is a man? A miserable little pile of secrets,” have endured beyond their source games to become well-known memes.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Verity Townsend is a Japan-based freelance writer who previously served as editor, contributor and translator for the game news site Automaton West. She has also written about Japanese culture and movies for various publications.</em></p></section><div><h3 data-cy="object-summary-embed-title">In This Article</h3></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/indie-game-gets-the-best-accidental-marketing-in-japan-after-title-mistranslated-to-shy-dungeon]]></content:encoded>

                <p dir="ltr">Since its first chapter launched in October 2021, Poppy Playtime has emerged as one of the premier indie horror titles in gaming, with its cute-in-a-creepy-way mascot Huggy Wuggy reaching Freddy Fazbear levels of notoriety. Today, appropriately on Halloween, Mob Entertainment has delivered a treat: The first teaser for Poppy Playtime Chapter 5, the final chapter of the Poppy Playtime saga, is here.</p><p dir="ltr">The 45-second trailer shows off some of the places players will be traveling through in the latest chapter, including laboratories, medical facilities, and one area that resembles the hallway of a school. We do see a brief shadow of a gigantic spider-like being in one shot, while others feature a colorful goo stuck to the floors and walls.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Before the final shot--which shows a cardboard standee of Poppy Playtime burning and surrounded by goo--transitions to the number 5, a brief message flashes on the screen. The message says the following:</p><p dir="ltr">"<em>A needle pulls a thread. The body writhes on the table. 'Is this it? Is this life?' Footsteps echo off the manor floors. 'What do I do now? Where do I belong?' The eyes glue to the screen. You think you know what he wants? You don't know anything.

                <p>Looking for a fittingly eerie game to mark Halloween? Stasis, the award-winning sci-fi horror adventure from The Brotherhood, is free to claim until Monday morning over at GOG. The game combines a gruesome, story-driven narrative with classic point-and-click gameplay, inviting players to explore, combine items, and solve puzzles in a chilling, retro-inspired setting.</p><p>Set in the distant future aboard the derelict spaceship Groomlake, Stasis follows John Maracheck as he awakens from cryogenic sleep in excruciating pain, separated from his wife and daughter. With time running out and the ship sinking into Neptune's dense methane clouds, John must uncover the horrifying truth behind the facility’s experiments. The game's isometric perspective and richly detailed 2D environments create an immersive sense of dread and isolation.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b3eKjhTL1Zs" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/b3eKjhTL1Zs" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Stasis features a cinematic score by Mark Morgan (most notably known for his work on Fallout and Fallout 2), a slew of characters to interact with, and a range of realistic and challenging puzzles. Originally released in 2015, it won the Aggie Award for Best Adventure Game. For a limited time, players can experience the game for free, making it an ideal choice for Halloween-themed gaming.</p><p>If you're looking for more to play, check out our list of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-free-horror-games/2900-7151/#11" data-ref-id="2900-7151">best free horror games</a>, which features everything from puzzles to creepy farm sims</p>

<p>A Colorado Federal court has ordered (as per the <a href="https://torrentfreak.com/images/keighin-final.pdf">Final Judgment</a>) that Keighin must pay Nintendo of America $17,500 in damages. This verdict follows on from an additional motion was <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/04/nintendo-seeks-injunction-and-usd17500-in-damages-from-pirate-streamer">filed in April 2025</a> after Keighin repeatedly evaded responding.</p>
<p>Magistrate Judge Scott T. Varholak's <a href="https://torrentfreak.com/images/keighin-reco.pdf">recommendation</a> states that Keighin streamed gameplay footage "before the games were released to the public" on "at least fifty occasions", with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/mario_and_luigi_brothership">Mario &amp; Luigi: Brothership</a> being the most recent example.</p><div><figure data-videoid="3ZPwyfIL_qU" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3ZPwyfIL_qU?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="yt3ZPwyfIL_qU" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/3ZPwyfIL_qU?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3ZPwyfIL_qU?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed444994ngxpwj&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>837k</span></a></p>

<p>Other games include <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/legend_of_zelda_echoes_of_wisdom">The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pikmin_4">Pikmin 4</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_party_jamboree">Super Mario Party Jamboree</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_bros_wonder">Super Mario Bros. Wonder</a>.</p>
<p>However, the court has refused to issue a permanent injunction on the streamer to destroy "all circumvention devices" as it is "unclear what purpose those would serve or what devices would be covered by this provision" as most of them are freely available on the internet.</p>

<p>Similarly, an injunction against third parties has also been denied on the basis that "Plaintiff’s Complaint does not allege that Defendant is working in concert with any third party".</p>
<p>In terms of the streaming, the recommendation highlights numerous times where Keighin publicly acknowledges his actions, including sharing links to emulation software on social media and even directly emailing Nintendo to say that he "will actively help people find newer and updated copies".</p>
<p>Keighin has also made other public posts taunting Nintendo, such as "You might run a corporation. I run the streets". We won't share <em>most</em> of those here, though, as many of the posts use strong and derogatory language.</p>
<p>The court has ordered the Keighin to pay $17,500 — $10,000 for streaming <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/paper_mario_the_thousand-year_door">Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door</a>, and $500 for 15 violations including distribution of links to emulators, cryptographic keys, and circumventing technological measures to play the unreleased games.</p>
<p>Nintendo has until 13th November 2025 to submit a Status Report to the court laying out its next steps.</p>

The store is having <a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8836598/type/dlg/https://electronics.woot.com/plus/hot-deals-on-video-games" rel="sponsored">a sale on new video games and game accessories</a> that’s live now, and runs through November 8th at 11:59PM CT. Dozens of games for all three current-generation systems are on sale, but the Switch 2 titles caught our eye because of how new they are. Woot’s deals are especially enticing because first-party Nintendo games don’t go on sale very often.</p><p>Woot’s sale also includes discounts on Switch 2 exclusives, including <em>Donkey Kong Banaza </em>and<em> Mario Kart World, </em>and Switch 2 Edition versions of <em>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild </em>and<em> Kirby and the Forgotten Land Plus Star-Crossed World</em>. The latter are enhanced versions of games released for the original Switch that have new exclusive content, a boost in performance, or both. If you already own the original versions of these games, Nintendo allows you to download a paid upgrade pack to get the enhancements instead of paying full price for the entire game.</p><p>There are also some respectable discounts on games released for the original Nintendo Switch, which can be played on the Switch 2, so we’ve included them here. In some cases games are listed as being an “international version” of the title, which is fine because the Nintendo Switch 2 is a region free console that’s able to play them.</p><div><div data-product-filter="" id="product-card-dmcyOnByb2R1Y3Q6ODExMjUy"><p><span>$<!-- -->62</span></p><div><p><em>Donkey Kong Bananza </em>is one of the Switch 2’s first exclusive must-have titles. Its destructible environment allows you to smash your way through each of its 17 levels, and the paths you make will remain intact unless you specifically choose to reset the world. Your companion Paulene’s singing allows you to transform into animals that have abilities that allow you to reach previously inaccessible parts of levels. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games-review/707704/donkey-kong-bananza-review-nintendo-switch-2">Read our review</a>.</p></div></div><div data-product-filter="" id="product-card-dmcyOnByb2R1Y3Q6ODExMjgx"><p><span>$<!-- -->70</span></p><div><p><em>Mario Kart World</em> mixes up the formula that’s remained more or less the same since 1992. You still progress by out-racing your competitors across several cups, but there’s a new Knockout Tour mode in which you actually drive from stage to stage in an interconnected world. There’re new weapons to collect, an item that allows you to change costumes mid-race, and a single player mode loaded with challenges. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games-review/684518/mario-kart-world-review-nintendo-switch-2">Read our review</a>.</p></div></div><div data-product-filter="" id="product-card-dmcyOnByb2R1Y3Q6ODExMjc0"><p><span>$<!-- -->63</span></p><div><p><em>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild </em>is one of the most highly-regarded games of all time thanks to its massive open world.

The Switch 2 Edition runs in 4K at 60 frames per second, so you can appreciate Hyrule even more. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/681361/nintendo-switch-2-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-edition">Read our hands-on</a>.</p></div></div><div data-product-filter="" id="product-card-dmcyOnByb2R1Y3Q6ODExMjcx"><p><span>$<!-- -->70</span></p><div><p>The Switch 2 Edition of <em>The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom </em>has the same technical enhancements as <em>Breath of the Wild</em>, but they’re more welcome here because the game struggled to run a bit on the original Switch.

The Switch 2-exclusive Jamboree TV mode introduces mini games that utilize the system’s Joy-Con 2 mouse controls and optional USB-C Camera. </p></div></div><div data-product-filter="" id="product-card-dmcyOnByb2R1Y3Q6ODExMjY2"><p><span>$<!-- -->70</span></p><div><p><em>Kirby and the Forgotten Land Plus Star-Crossed World </em>includes the original Switch title, plus 12 levels whose environments have been reshaped by a meteorite.

However, each level contains “Wonder Seeds,” which turn the stage into a challenging, psychedelic stage when collected.

            <p>My dearest Hedwig, I write to you from the churning battlefields of King Friedrich II's campaign to reinforce Silesia against the lurking Gallic aggressor. I regret to inform you that the French Hussars are kicking our Hussarses. We just engaged what our scouts from the 17th Pop-Up Tutorial Squadron promised was a "light" patrol of ill-trained musketmen and cavalry, just outside Hildesheim. French equestrians appear to be made of different stuff than our Prussian chargers. They cleave through our Landmiltz like wheat. Meanwhile, our horseguys can't take a single bayonet to the gaskin without turning for home. 
</p><!--more-->
<p>All is bloodmist and flashing unit banners. There is no time, dear Hedwig, for the baguette-wielding infidels swiftly descend upon my sole surviving regiment of Cantonist Recruits. Our ill-named leader Count von Smash has long since cast down his sabre and left to pursue a second career as a humble peasant with a suspiciously fine moustache. Avenge me, my love! Complete the Silesian campaign in Master Of Command and retrieve my bloody bones!

<p>If you're hungry for another historical Total War, and besotted specifically with the gunpowder combat of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/napoleon-total-war">Napoleon: Total War</a> and Empire: Total War, you might enjoy Master Of Command, Armchair History Interactive's real-time <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy game</a> set during the Seven Years War of 1756 to 1763. 
</p><p>That's my conclusion after 40 minutes with it, anyway. The game <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2878450/Master_of_Command/">only just launched on Steam</a>, and there is a heck of a lot of period detail to chew through, but you can boil it down as follows: you lead an army around a procedurally generated map of real-ish places cloaked in fog of war, duffing up rival armies and claiming or trading with settlements while managing your supplies. 
</p>
<p>Your army consists of upgradeable regiments drawn from a whiskery bestiary of 150 celebrated 18th century European military units. There are officers with buffs and customisable hats, and many kinds of equipment to consider, such as tricking your muzzleloaders out with the latest cylindrical ramrods to shorten the gap between volleys. On the battlefield, meanwhile, you line up your grenadiers, fusiliers, cossacks and whatnot to outmarch, outgun, outflank and otherwise outfox the enemy, while taking advantage of terrain features like hedgerows, and monitoring each regiment's ammo and morale.

<p>I am skimming through the nerdy warfaring minutiae here not out of disrespect for historians (armchair-based or otherwise), but simply because AAAAARGH, I think this game is trying to kill me with proper nouns. I am swimming in a sea of heraldry and plumed headgear. Fortunately, the in-game presentation is quite intuitive, so far, without simply being functional. The maps, menus, UI elements and character portraits are wrought in bright, bold colours.

The supposedly harmonious city’s urban redevelopment plan includes </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemon/comments/1izjtjg/future_kalos_has_antihomeless_benches/"><span>anti-homeless benches</span></a><span>? If we’re supposed to be living alongside Pokémon in the Paris-inspired city, why do they live in walled-off Wild Zones? Yeah, they thankfully have free healthcare, but why is Nurse Joy having to take on two jobs as both healer and shopkeeper in this city? Those are questions that hang over a game that is very much trying to figure its world out, but one of the moments of clarity it does have captures how, in the </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>universe, cops would absolutely try to enlist these monsters in state-sanctioned violence. No moment captures that better than the “Investigating with Shuppet” quest.</span></p>  <p><span>Rancun, a Lumiose City cop, asks if you can bring him a Shuppet to help with his investigations. In his mind, the ghost-type Pokémon’s ability to sense negative emotions such as jealousy and vindictiveness is something that could help him identify criminals before they have a chance to commit a crime. If you’ve never encountered stories like the cyberpunk anime </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/psycho-pass-is-a-compelling-cyberpunk-mystery-and-its-5973624"><i><span>Psycho-Pass</span></i></a><span>, there are entire subgenres of dystopian fiction about how police over-surveilling citizens based almost entirely on vibes can lead to an oppressive police state. And this officer is imagining a world in which he can co-opt an innocent Pokémon into his surveillance scheme and doesn’t see anything wrong with that. But the quest is in our log, so what happens when you bring a Shuppet to Rancun? The funniest outcome, actually.</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000640502" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000640502"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000640502">© The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p><span>After you catch a Shuppet and bring the living puppet to Rancun, he tells the ghost that the peace of the city “depends on” it, and asks it to home in on some of these negative emotions it can sense. Funnily enough, Shuppet doesn’t go looking for someone stealing food to help feed their family, but instead takes the cop right back to his own front door. His wife greets us there and asks her husband if he’s still working. When Rancun says that yes, he’s still on a case, she says, seeming slightly annoyed, “Well, I guess you’re still busy with work…Good luck with the investigation.” Before she can head back inside, Shuppet cries out at her, insisting it’s found some negative emotions here. That’s when the truth comes out: It turns out his wife has been feeling neglected by Rancun’s workaholic nature, and has grown resentful. The grudge had grown so strong, in fact, that Shuppet felt it across the city. Rancun decides he should probably devote more energy to his marriage, hopefully indicating that he’s no longer invested in trying to create a Pokémon-powered police state.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>has a surprising track record when it comes to </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-detective-pikachu-returns-switch-acab-is-a-cop-1850906651"><span>cop commentary</span></a><span>, including the time </span><i><span>Detective Pikachu </span></i><a href="https://kotaku.com/detective-pikachu-returns-pokemon-review-switch-1850915720"><span>got arrested on false charges</span></a><span> and did a jail break.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Netflix is looking into buying Warner Bros. Discovery, which could include the full library of Warner Bros. Games and intellectual properties (IPs).</p>



<p>The news <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/warner-bros-discovery-sale-potential-game-impact/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">comes just over a week</a> after Warner Bros. Discovery announced it was opening up sales bids after it had received “unsolicited interest from multiple parties for the entire company.”</p>



<p>According to <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/10/netflix-exploring-warner-bros-bid-1236603687/">Deadline</a>, Netflix has hired investment bank Moelis &amp; Co to explore a bid for the company. It’s the same firm that helped with Skydance’s merger with Paramount. </p>



<h2 id="h-what-could-happen-to-warner-bros-games-under-netflix">What Could Happen To Warner Bros. Games Under Netflix?</h2>



<p>What’s unclear, though possible to happen, is if a Netflix acquisition would see all of Warner Bros. Games be assumed into Netflix Games. Currently, Warner Bros. Games holds major gaming franchises such as Mortal Kombat, Harry Potter, DC Comics, Game of Thrones, and more. </p>



<p>Warner Bros. Games also owns multiple studios, including Avalanche Software, NetherRealm Studios, Rocksteady Studios, TT Games, and WB Games studios in Montreal, Boston, New York, and San Francisco. All of which would likely be included in any sale. </p>



<p>Netflix declined to comment to Deadline on the report. Insider Gaming has also reached out to Warner Bros. Discovery for comment on whether any sale would include the games division. Thus far, no response has been received.  </p>



<p>Netflix has attempted to make a dent in the games industry in recent years, but it has never fully gotten off the ground. That said, the company is <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/netflix-is-doubling-down-on-its-gaming-investment/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">continuing to invest in gaming</a> on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dont-nod-netflix-major-ip-game-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">various fronts</a>.</p>



<p>What do you think the future would hold if Netflix were to acquire Warner Bros. Games? Leave your thoughts down in the comments, and join the official&nbsp;<a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

                <p>November is upon us, and to celebrate, Fanatical has revealed its <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?fntitle=Get+Schedule+I+And+14+Games+For+%2420+In+This+Movember+Charity+Bundle&amp;fnauthor=darranged&amp;fndate=2025-10-31+09%3A21%3A00&amp;fnupdated=2025-10-31+09%3A22%3A00&amp;fnarticle_id=6535850&amp;fntype1=Games&amp;fntype2=News&amp;fntype3=Deals&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dpbolvw.net%2Fclick-100770772-13797872%3Fsid%3Dsubid_value%26url%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.fanatical.com%2Fen%2Fbundle%2Fmovember-game-stache-charity-bundle-2025&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fget-schedule-i-and-14-games-for-20-in-this-movember-charity-bundle%2F1100-6535850%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Movember Game 'Stache Charity Bundle</a>. Themed around the Movember mustache movement--an annual event encouraging the growth of moustaches in an effort to raise awareness around men's health issues--this bundle offers a curated selection of PC games for $20. Proceeds will go to charity, and each game in this bundle will be delivered as a Steam key that can be redeemed on your account.</p><p>As for the games, the selection includes titles like Schedule I, Mon Bazou, Gloomwood, and Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous - Enhanced Edition. Schedule I has been a sleeper hit this year--and one of our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-co-op-games/2900-5361/" data-ref-id="2900-5361">favorite co-op games</a>--even if it does revolve around acts that would be illegal in real life. As a small-time drug dealer, it's up to you to build a drug empire and deal with threats to your organization like rival cartels and law enforcement. The game usually costs $20 on its own, so this bundle deal works out to be pretty good value for money, in case you've been thinking of purchasing Schedule I.</p><p>Anyone looking to revisit the era of old-school shooters will want to check out Dusk, which plays like Quake 2 with a metal soundtrack and horror vibes. The game features three campaigns to blast your way through, and has become a cult-classic over the years with its polished action. Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous can consume dozens of your waking hours with its fantasy gameplay, Valthirian Arc: Hero School Story is a charming RPG, and The Corridor is a game about walking down a corridor--no, really.</p><h2>Movember Game 'Stache Charity Bundle (2025)</h2><ul><li>Schedule I</li><li>Mon Bazou</li><li>Gloomwood (Steam Deck Playable)</li><li>Pathfinder: Wrath of the Righteous Enhanced Edition (Steam Deck Playable)</li><li>Instruments of Destruction (Steam Deck Playable)</li><li>Men of War 2</li><li>Hello Neighbor 2 (Steam Deck Playable)</li><li>Chivalry 2 (Steam Deck Playable)</li><li>American Truck Simulator (Steam Deck Verified)</li><li>Dusk (Steam Deck verified)</li><li>Agent Intercept</li><li>Prodigal</li><li>Warhammer 40,000: Battlesector (Steam Deck Verified)</li><li>Valthirian Arc: Hero School Story (Steam Deck Playable)</li><li>The Corridor (Steam Deck Playable)</li></ul><p>For another bundle deal, you can also check out Fanatical's <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?fntitle=Get+Schedule+I+And+14+Games+For+%2420+In+This+Movember+Charity+Bundle&amp;fnauthor=darranged&amp;fndate=2025-10-31+09%3A21%3A00&amp;fnupdated=2025-10-31+09%3A22%3A00&amp;fnarticle_id=6535850&amp;fntype1=Games&amp;fntype2=News&amp;fntype3=Deals&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dpbolvw.net%2Fclick-100770772-13797872%3Fsid%3Dsubid_value%26url%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.fanatical.com%2Fen%2Fpick-and-mix%2Fbuild-your-own-shooter-bundle&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fget-schedule-i-and-14-games-for-20-in-this-movember-charity-bundle%2F1100-6535850%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Build Your Own Shooter Bundle</a> deal.

			<p>Grand Theft Auto 4 with RTX Remix Path Tracing looks like the remaster we'll likely never get, introducing significant visual improvements that enhance the game's visuals considerably.</p>



<p>How much <a href="https://wccftech.com/take-look-path-traced-gta-4-rtx-remix-test-build/">the mod developed by Xoxor4D</a> enhances the visuals of the fourth entry in the series by Rockstar Games is shown in a new comparison video put together by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@MxBenchmarkPC">MxBenchmarkPC.</a> The video showcases the vanilla version of the game running side by side with the path-traced version at 4K and 1440p resolutions, utilizing NVIDIA DLSS and Frame Generation.</p>



<p>As expected, the mod is highly demanding, and even high-end modern hardware has trouble running it at 60 FPS without Frame Generation, but the results seem well worth the performance hit,  although some of the visual elements of the game, besides lighting and shadows, need an evident update, such as character models and low-quality textures.</p>

<p>The Grand Theft Auto 4 RTX Remix mod is not yet available publicly. However, those interested in trying it out before its launch can do so by <a href="https://www.patreon.com/xoxor4d">supporting Xoxor4D on Patreon.</a></p>



<p>Replaying through Grand Theft Auto 4 with RTX Remix path tracing and other mods is definitely a good way to make the wait for Grand Theft Auto 6 more bearable. The sixth entry in the series was initially scheduled to launch on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S this year, but <a data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(16, 80, 126, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(16, 80, 126, 0.2)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-all dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-launches-may-26/">Rockstar Games ultimately delayed the game to May 2026. </a></p>



<p>While no precise reason was provided for the game's delay, Rockstar Games stated in the message shared to announce the delay that the additional development time was required to meet and exceed players' expectations for a game whose launch is predicted to be <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-is-expected-to-be-the-biggest-entertainment-launch-of-all-time-but-a-performance-below-expectations-could-impact-the-entire-industry/">the biggest entertainment launch to date.</a></p>

              <p>Good morning! Happy Halloween! Yes, kids all around the nation get to enjoy one of life’s best treats: A Friday Halloween. Stay up late, kids, and eat so much candy. But before you wreck your teeth and stomachs, let’s get through today’s Morning Checkpoint, <em>Kotaku</em>‘s daily roundup of gaming news and culture. Today, we have evidence of a <em>Silent Hill 2</em> remake Xbox port, more layoff news, the reveal of pets in <em>Fortnite</em>, and some new ports of&nbsp;<em>Turok 2&nbsp;</em>arriving courtesy of Nightdive Studios.</p> <h2><strong><em>Fortnite</em> adds animal sidekicks</strong></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000640494" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000640494"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000640494">©Epic Games</figcaption></figure> <p>On Thursday, <a href="https://www.fortnite.com/news/introducing-fortnite-sidekicks?lang=en-US">Epic announced</a> that the long-rumored pets feature is finally arriving in <em>Fortnite</em> on November 1 alongside<em> The Simpsons</em> mini-season. These tiny buddies are officially known as “Sidekicks” and will follow you around in battle royale and other <em>Fortnite</em> modes. However, enemy players won’t see them in competitive modes, so your cute puppy doesn’t give away your position and get you killed. Sidekicks will also be immune to damage and will feature their own customization options that can be unlocked by completing quests. I can already hear Epic’s bank account filling with even more money.</p>

 <h2><strong>The <em>Silent Hill 2</em> remake is likely coming to Xbox in the near future</strong></h2> <p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1okrnqd/silent_hill_2_has_been_rated_for_xbox_series_xs/">Folks have spotted</a> an ESRB rating for a yet-to-be-announced Xbox port of last year’s excellent <em>Silent Hill 2</em> remake. This doesn’t officially confirm such a port will happen, but it seems very, very likely that Konami is gearing up to bring the remake to Xbox Series X/S in not too distant future. At the moment, <em>Silent Hill 2</em> is only available on PS5 and PC.</p>

 <h2><strong><em>MGS3</em> remake’s multiplayer mode is now available</strong></h2>  <p>When Konami’s fancy remake of M<em>etal Gear Solid 3</em> launched back in August, the game’s promised multiplayer mode was missing as it needed more time in the oven. Now, <em>Fox Hunt</em> is finally out as part of a free update. At launch, <em>Fox Hunt</em> features two stealth-focused multiplayer modes and supports 12 players. While it ain’t a new version of <em>Metal Gear Online</em>, I’m certainly curious to check it out. I mean, once I find time to play it and the 20 other games I still need to play this year.</p> <h2><strong>More layoffs hit Heart Machine</strong></h2> <p>The studio behind <em>Hyper Light Drifter </em>and <em>Solar Ash</em> is reportedly laying off employees for the second time this month. <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/report-possessor-s-dev-heart-machine-lays-off-more-staff-two-weeks-before-the-game-s-launch">As reported by <em>GameDeveloper.com</em>,</a> at least four different staff members have recently posted on social media that they were laid off. One now out-of-work dev shared a video suggesting that by the time the studio’s next game, <span data-testid="content-text"><span><em>Possessor(s)</em>, launches on November 11, most, if not all, of the people who worked on it might be gone from the indie studio. This is the second round of layoffs to hit the company this month and the third round in early 2025.&nbsp;</span></span></p> <h2>ICYMI:</h2> <ul> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-battlefield-6-skins-silly-cosmetics-crossover-black-ops-7-steam-2000640251"><em>Arc Raiders</em> will avoid silly, immersion-breaking skins</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/halloween-candy-price-inflation-trump-tariff-snap-2000640156">Candy prices are going up thanks to President Trump</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/escape-simulator-2-room-interview-pine-studio-2000639908">A wonderful interview with the devs behind <em>Escape Sim 2</em></a></li> </ul> <h2>Watch This:</h2>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Six One Publishing, a new publishing wing from the team behind the Six One Indie Showcase, has announced the first game under its label. Introducing Blue Ridge Hunting, a co-op horror game set in the Appalachian Mountains from Jade Meadows.</p>



<p>Players will either go on the hunt solo or with up to two friends to follow the journey of Levi Chambers, <strong>“a disgruntled West Virginia native haunted by sightings of the infamous Mothman his entire life.”</strong> </p>



<p>The game, according to the press release, will explore themes of trauma, grief, and family through the lens of Appalachian folklore.</p>



<p><strong>“The Appalachian Mountains are steeped in some of America’s most chilling folklore, home to legendary cryptids and unexplained phenomena,”</strong> the game’s description reads. <strong>“Step into the boots of the Appalachian Investigation Group, a team dedicated to tracking these elusive creatures. Using a range of tools and equipment, gather evidence, follow the clues, and embark on high-stakes hunts based on real sightings and local legends.”</strong></p>



<p>Features of the game include (courtesy of Six One Publishing):</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Found Footage:&nbsp;</strong>A gritty retro/PSX art style inspired by early 3D horror and analog media.</li>



<li><strong>Always Listening:&nbsp;</strong>Creatures react to proximity voice chat and radio chatter. Communication is crucial, but dangerous.</li>



<li><strong>Into the Woods, Solo or Together:</strong>&nbsp;Explore the Appalachian wilds alone or with up to 5 players in online co-op freeplay mode.</li>



<li><strong>Bump In The Night:&nbsp;</strong>A narrative-driven story (1–3 players) following the Appalachian Investigation Group’s hunt for the truth.</li>



<li><strong>Experience The Legends:&nbsp;</strong>Face unique, intelligent creatures based on real Appalachian legends and folklore.</li>



<li><strong>Dark-Bluegrass Symphony:</strong>&nbsp;An original score that blends haunting melodies with Appalachian roots, amplifying the tension and tone.</li>
</ul>



<p>The game will launch first in early access and include a full story when 1.0 releases. There’s no release date just yet for Blue Ridge Hunting, but a demo is available now <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2434930/Blue_Ridge_Hunting/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">via Steam</a>, along with <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/jadecompany/blue-ridge-hunting" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a Kickstarter</a> to help with the game’s development. </p>

Priced at $45, the classic side-scrolling platformer features over 30 levels spread across four worlds. The original game revolved around Croc taking on Baron Dante and his minions, and this version features upgraded controls and enhanced save functions.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4594385-croc-1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4594385" data-ratio="0.56266666666667" data-width="1500" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4594385-croc-1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4594385"></a><figcaption>Croc: 25th Anniversary Edition</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4594385-croc-1.jpg"></figure><p>Buck and the Cursed Cartridge is billed as a fast-paced run-and-gun platformer from ModRetro.

                <p>It seems that Square Enix is getting into the Halloween spirit and upping its fashion game. That would explain why the company behind <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/final-fantasy-xiv-online-a-realm-reborn/" data-ref-id="5000-148228">Final Fantasy 14</a> announced on October 31 that its long-running MMO would do away with class requirements for glamours, the game's equivalent of transmogrification.</p><p>In layman's terms, players can now use the appearance of any armor set regardless of their current class and job. That means that healers like white mages can now ditch their fancy robes and look like hulking dark knights--one of Final Fantasy 14's tank classes--and vice versa. Pandæmonium, indeed.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/FF_XIV_EN/status/1984241152321814609" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">Fashion enjoyers, this one is for you!<br>From Patch 7.4 onward, you'll be able to equip any glamours regardless of your class/job! ✨<br>Mix and match your favorite outfits and slay on the battlefield! 💅 <a href="https://t.co/4WogdAbGM6" rel="nofollow ">pic.twitter.com/4WogdAbGM6</a></p>  — FINAL FANTASY XIV (@FF_XIV_EN) <a href="https://twitter.com/FF_XIV_EN/status/1984241152321814609?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 31, 2025</a></blockquote>              </div><p>In the past, Final Fantasy 14 has been fairly strict about jobs using armor that falls within their respective schools of equipment. For example, all tanking and healing jobs share gear, but things get much dicier in this regard when looking at DPS roles, especially ones that differ between ranged attack and melee.

            <p>Nintendo has won a lawsuit against streamer Jesse Keighin, who was sued by the Japanese video game giant for allegedly streaming pirated games before they were released.
</p>
<p>Nintendo also alleged that Keighin had taunted the company, claiming he sent a letter: "boasting that he has 'a thousand burner channels' to stream from and 'can do this all day'". <a href="https://torrentfreak.com/nintendo-wins-lawsuit-against-defiant-pirate-streamer-everygameguru/">Outlet Torrent Freak</a> reported that Keighin posted on Facebook: "Should have done more research on me. You might run a corporation, I run the streets."
</p>
<p>Following the successful lawsuit, Colorado federal courts have ordered Keighin to pay $17,500 to Nintendo. The judge presiding over the case did reject two of Nintendo's permanent injunctions however, these being related to the destruction of circumvention devices, as well as an injunction to apply to third parties who were involved alongside Keighin.

</figure>
<p>The judge deemed the request to destroy these circumvention devices "unclear" and "unreasonable", due to the fact that Keighin used online emulation services. As for an injunction applicable to third parties, the judge rejected the proposal as Nintendo failed to specify who these third parties were.
</p>
<p>The $17,500 figure comes from a $10,000 fine for Keighin's latest infringement, the streaming of Mario &amp; Luigi: Brotherhood, while the remaining $7,500 comes from fifteen separate $500 fines for multiple previous violations of Nintendo's anti-piracy measures.
</p>
<p>This is the latest development in an ongoing war raged by Nintendo against pirates. It was only earlier this month when <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-seeks-45m-against-reddit-moderator-accused-of-pirating-switch-games-in-latest-crackdown-against-piracy">Nintendo announced its intent to sue a Reddit moderator accused of pirating its games for $4.5m</a>. Nintendo previously <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-reserves-the-right-to-brick-your-console-following-unauthorised-use-in-bid-to-prevent-piracy">updated its Nintendo Account Agreement, reserving the right to brick consoles in an attempt to curb piracy</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Panic Stations is a new game developer formed by former Mediatonic developers who worked on the popular competitive multiplayer title, Fall Guys. The studio announced itself with a <a href="https://x.com/PanicStationsHQ/status/1983881949266530781">post on its official X (formerly Twitter) account</a> in a video filled with cartoon pigeons. Joe Walsh, a game designer at Panic Stations, provides the voice over for the first pigeon you see, beginning the video by saying, "<em>Games should be funnier and they should be stupider. Here at Panic Stations, we're going to fix that</em>."</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>The team is currently working on its debut game, which it says is "<em>not about pigeons</em>" <a href="https://www.panicstations.com/">according to its website</a>. In an interview with GamesIndustry.Biz, co-founder Paul Croft said, "<em>I'm a huge fan of the online co-op space and it's been amazing to see it evolve over the last few years. It is really exciting to team-up with some old friends - we're aiming to build games that bring immediate joy to players and bring people closer together</em>."</p>



<p>Croft is not wrong to point out that cooperative games are having a bit of a moment, especially when you consider how successful games like Peak, R.E.P.O., and Lethal Company have been recently. A cooperative game with a solid gameplay loop that also encourages comedic gameplay scenarios is a real recipe for success.</p>



<p>Whatever Panic Stations makes for their debut game, it'll certainly be interesting to see, especially when considering the pedigree they have coming from Fall Guys, a game that absolutely no one saw coming <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/fall-guys-falling-in-and-out-of-love/">when it first arrived in 2020</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>South Korean game studio Shift Up recently posted a developer interview video to celebrate the third anniversary of its RPG <em>Goddess of Victory: NIK</em>KE. And as reported by <em><a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/shift-up-says-it-doesnt-tolerate-any-expressions-of-hate-in-nikke-following-backlash-over-alleged-small-genital-gesture/">Automation Media</a></em> and <em><a href="https://www.thisisgame.com/articles/405545">ThisIsGame,</a> </em>during this video, the studio’s director Hyungsuk Yoo took a hard stance against “<a href="https://youtu.be/dYEX1ND8HrI?t=1864">hateful expressions</a>” in the popular RPG, saying: “We will never tolerate anyone intentionally inserting hate speech into <em>NIKKE</em> or approaching the game with that mindset.”</p> <p>However, the devs don’t directly mention what this is in reference to in the video; it’s very likely an attempt to address a controversial situation involving a piece of art created for <em>NIKKE</em> and an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finger_pinching_conspiracy_theory">odd conspiracy online involving a pinched hand gesture</a> that many men in South Korea believe mocks men with small penises.</p>

 <p>In August, to celebrate the game’s 1,000th day in operation, <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/20251030-53477-001.jpg">a piece of artwork was released.</a> Some South Korean men online alleged that two characters in the artwork were covertly flashing the pinched fingers gesture. <a href="https://game.naver.com/lounge/nikke/board/detail/6464533">Shift Up quickly apologized</a>, edited the image <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/20251030-53477-002.jpg">to remove the gestures</a>, and blamed the whole incident on an overseas team responsible for the art. But that hasn’t stopped many online players from continuing to harass the devs and leave angry comments. So the recent commitment against “hateful expressions” is seen by many as the studio’s latest attempt to calm things down.</p> <p>It’s unlikely this will work, though, as the “Crab Hand” gesture has become a widely embraced conspiracy theory among many men in South Korea who believe it to be connected to a feminist movement in the country that some believe went too far. As a result of this situation, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finger_pinching_conspiracy_theory#List_of_notable_responses">many, many companies have faced backlash</a> for artwork or ads that seem to include “crab hands,” even when it seems obvious that the art wasn’t intended to mock anyone or the hands are only vaguely pinched.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/game-awards-2025-goty-race-polymarket-clair-obscur-2000640468</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/betting-markets-have-decided-silksong-doesn%E2%80%99t-have-a-chance-in-hell-of-winning-game-of-the-year.1340446/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Polymarket has opened up betting on The Game Awards 2025 and no one seems to have a doubt that <a href="https://kotaku.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-rpg-review-in-progress-1851777402"><em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em></a> will take top honors at Geoff Keighley’s showcase. The odds are so stacked in the French RPG’s favor that a $100 bet on <em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em> would net you over $1,000 if it actually ended up winning game of the year instead.</p> <p>Gambling on the 2025 GOTY race opened up on <a href="https://polymarket.com/event/game-awards-game-of-the-year-2025">Polymarket</a> on October 29, well in advance of anyone actually voting on what game will actually win has even begun. The Best Game category is decided by media ballots (90 percent) and fan voting (10 percent) with the winner revealed during the <a href="https://kotaku.com/game-awards-keighley-e3-trailers-1851083267">live show on December 11</a>.</p>

 <p>Nominees are chosen in November followed by a final round of voting. While it’s Keighley’s show, he doesn’t participate in any part of the selection process. Also, full disclosure, <em>Kotaku</em> has never participated in voting and nothing in this article should be mistaken for financial advice (that’s a thing you’re supposed to write, right?)</p>

 <p>With all of those wrinkles in mind, the first 48 hours of the <a href="https://kotaku.com/game-awards-goty-game-of-the-year-past-winners-list-1851721067">GOTY race</a> on Polymarket were interesting to witness. While<em> Clair Obscur</em> is currently leading with bets suggesting an 80 percent chance of winning, it didn’t start out that way. It was actually<em> Silksong</em> who was the frontrunner in the initial hour after the market opened. Whoever was betting first must have been all in on the Metroidvania hype.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000640482" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000640482"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000640482">Polymarket / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>But it didn’t take long for the pack of frontrunners, which also included <em>Death Stranding 2</em> and <em>Hades 2</em>, to fall way behind Sandfall Interactive’s surprise turn-based hit. All of those other games are not currently trending in the single-digits. <em>Silksong</em> is second with 8 percent, <em>Hades 2</em> is third with 5 percent, and <em>Death Stranding</em> only has 3 percent. Over $75,000 has been wagered so far.</p>

 <p>From there<em> Split Fiction</em>, <em>The Oute Worlds 2</em>, <em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance II</em>, <em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em>, <em>Elden Ring: Nightreign</em>, and <em>Blue Prince</em> all have at least a percentage point. <em>Ghost of Yotei</em> and every other game that came out this year, on the other hand, are all at decimal points. Shockingly, there is over $900 of betting volume on <em>Grand Theft Auto 6</em>, a game which is not coming out this year. I guess someone didn’t get the memo.</p>

 <h2>The <em>Clair Obscur </em>GOTY train keeps chugging along</h2> <p>What can we make of all this? Remember, prediction markets aren’t an indication of what will happen, they’re a measure of what people&nbsp;<em>think</em> might happen. The complete domination of <em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em> could mean that lots of people played it and think it’s great, or it could just mean people who like placing wagers on Polymarket are seeing how jazzed everyone else is about the game and trying to refine that online noise into quantifiable signals.</p>

 <p><em>Polygon</em>‘s Oli Welsh, who maintains a rolling list of GOTY frontrunners based on a mix of experience, vibes, and data, has had <em>Clair Obscur</em> <a href="https://www.polygon.com/awards/546327/game-of-the-year-game-awards-2025-frontrunners/">in the lead for a while</a>. Maybe Polymarket users are taking their cues from him! One of the only variations from the current betting landscape is that he has<em> Yotei </em>in closer contention, even if it’s still an outside shot. If you look at Metacritic, however, <em>Hades 2</em> technically has a higher composite review score from all of the aggregated critics. Those are the people who do most of the voting, after all.</p> <p>The actual mechanics of how various outlets vote, from magazines like <em>Game Informer</em> to YouTube groups like <em>Easy Allies</em>, probably play an even bigger role in deciding the outcome than ambient industry vibes. Some ballots are decided on purely by the head of those outlets. Others do informal internal voting. Some might make choices based on what they&nbsp;<em>think</em> is supposed to be the right answer, just like the Polymarket folks are doing. Others might decide based purely on what the most people at that outlet played and liked. Often passion carries the day. Five people really liking game X might not carry the day against three who think Y is the most important game of the decade.</p> <p>Will that messy, inconsistent process yield <em>Clair Obscur</em> as the winner this year? The users on Polymarket clearly think so. We won’t know until the paper envelope is opened on stage by the <a href="https://kotaku.com/game-awards-2024-rebirth-astro-bot-winners-goty-list-1851720291">makers of last year’s winner<em>, Astro Bot</em></a>.</p>

              <p>Laptops that are specifically designed with gamers and creatives in mind usually don’t come cheap. While the exact price depends on the configuration, most of the powerful options out there with solid graphics easily cross the $1,000 mark. Thankfully, that changes today.</p>
<p>Amazon has slashed the price of the latest <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5200/">16-inch HP Elitebook (AMD Ryzen 5, 32GB DDR5 RAM and 1TB PCIe SSD) down to $859, after an unbelievable $1,540 discount on the retail price of $2,399</a>. This is the lowest we have seen this machine drop to in a long while, and we don’t expect the offer to be around for long. It’s best to grab yours before it’s too late. There’s no telling if this discount will return for Black Friday or if the stock will even last that long.</p>

<h2>Reliable Performance for Both Work and Play</h2>
<p>Like most HP laptops, this machine comes in a sleek, lightweight build with a premium finish. The screen is a 16-inch diagonal Anti-Glare WUXGA display that delivers sharp, bright visuals. 400 nits of brightness keep everything clear in all lighting conditions, while blue light support makes all-nighters easier on your eyes. It’s also paired with Radeon 740M graphics, which can handle streaming and gaming without stutters.</p>
<p>There’s a spill-resistant, backlit keyboard that’s quite comfortable to use for longer sessions. Calls are made easy with a 5MP camera paired with Poly Studio-tuned speakers and AI noise reduction – you’ll look your best, and sound just as good.</p>



<p>For power, you’re getting a 6-core AMD Ryzen 5 processor that can clock up to 4.9GHz; perfect for heavier workloads. Even better, it’s backed by 32GB of DDR5 RAM for some impressive multitasking, plus a 1TB PCIe NVMe SSD that offers much faster boot times than traditional drives. 1TB is also enough space to store all your essentials, from media content to work documents and games.</p>
<p>Connectivity-wise, it comes with Wi-Fi 6E and Bluetooth 5.3 for wireless connections, plus a full selection of ports including HDMI 2.1, Ethernet, two USB-A ports, and two Thunderbolt 4 USB-C ports.</p>

<p>Big releases continue to come thick and fast heading into the final months of the year, and the release date for Where Winds Meet stands out as one of the most anticipated in November.</p>



<p>Where Winds Meet is set to make waves across the rest of the world, having made its mark in China upon release last year, with millions of players signing up for pre-registration rewards ahead of the drop of the free-to-play title.</p>



<p>If you’re eagerly awaiting the journey across ancient China and are ready to learn the ways of Wuxia combat, we’ve got all the important details on the release date.</p>

<p><strong>Where Winds Meet is coming to PlayStation 5 and PC on Friday, November 14, and is available as a free-to-play title.</strong></p>



<p>Initially released in China in December 2024, Where Winds Meet’s global launch is on the horizon and has attracted a wealth of interest, receiving over seven million pre-registrations.</p>



<p>Almost a year since the release in China, Where Winds Meet is well-prepped for the global launch, and there isn’t too much longer to wait before you can begin your adventure.</p>



<p>As ever, though, there will be a bit more waiting depending on where you are located in the world, as the start times vary for time zones.</p>



<h2 id="h-do-we-know-the-where-winds-meet-start-time">Do We Know The Where Winds Meet Start Time?</h2>



<p><strong>Where Winds Meet has a global release of 3 PM PT on November 14, with access to the game opening for everyone across the world at the same time.</strong></p>



<p>Unlike a staggered release, which allows some players in Australia and New Zealand, for example, to be the first to jump in, there are no advantages for such locations this time. In fact, players in those time zones eagerly awaiting the release of Where Winds Meet will actually have to wait a little longer.</p>



<p>The doors open for Where Winds Meet at 3 PM PT, likely to be the same across all platforms, which means a wait until later in the evening, or even the next day, for some time zones.</p>
