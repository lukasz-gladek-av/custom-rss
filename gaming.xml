            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Blizzard has recently filed a copyright infringement lawsuit against the <a href="https://wccftech.com/turtle-wow-2-0-server-will-bring-azeroth-to-unreal-engine-5-with-dlss-and-fsr-support/">Turtle WoW server</a>, highlighting in the suit how the server's operators have built their business on ongoing infringement of the company's intellectual property.</p>



<p>As reported by <a href="https://massivelyop.com/2025/08/30/blizzard-files-copyright-infringement-lawsuit-against-world-of-warcraft-rogue-server-turtle-wow/">Massively Overpowered</a>, Blizzard finally took action against the rogue World of Warcraft server with a <a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/71235075/1/blizzard-entertainment-inc-v-turtle-wow/">lawsuit</a> that details how the server's operators have built their business on ongoing intellectual property infringement, profiting from the immense popularity of the popular MMORPG using protected vode and game assets.</p>



<p><em>"In the two decades since WoW first was released, Blizzard has invested an enormous amount of time and money into creating, maintaining, and updating the game,"</em> the legal complaint reads. <em>"But when unscrupulous actors such as Defendants seek to profit from Blizzard’s valuable intellectual property (including protected code and game assets) they undermine Blizzard’s own efforts to deliver classic and community-driven content, devalue the WoW experience, and cause serious harm to Blizzard and the many artists, programmers, game designers, and other creative professionals who have worked (and continue to work) tirelessly to create a unique and enjoyable gaming experience for both new and longtime players."</em></p>



<p>Everything considered, it's unlikely that the operators of the Turtle WoW servers will be able to prevent the complete shutdown of the server, all copies of the data from the project, a full account of the money earned by the project and the relinquishing of the domain to Blizzard as the company is demanding in the lawsuit, leaving players with no other choice but to play World of Warcraft classic to enjoy the vanilla WoW experience, although without the custom content the Turtle WoW server offered. The server operators, however, don't want to go down without a fight and have promised on the server's official Discord that Turtle WoW is here to stay and that they are prepared to take on the challenges ahead of them.</p>



<p>Speaking about the modern World of Warcraft experience, the long-running MMORPG will be expanded next year with the Midnight expansion. You can learn more about it in our <a href="https://wccftech.com/world-of-warcraft-midnight-qa-housing-long-term/">interview</a> conducted during last month's Gamescom.</p>

<p>Approximately 40 minutes of Star Wars Outlaws gameplay, running on the Nintendo Switch 2, has leaked online.</p>



<p>The gameplay was uploaded by the YouTuber mataleao, who has managed to get the game early on the Switch 2 ahead of its September 4, 2025, release date. You can watch the gameplay below:</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Star Wars Outlaws Switch 2 Gameplay" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bhNIf6ZWTwQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>As pointed out by some users in the YouTube comments, the gameplay appears surprisingly good, with some users noting that it even looks and seems to run better than Cyberpunk 2077.</p>



<p>“This runs amazing. It’s not 60fps and 1080p but it looks really smooth. The people complaining are just holding these ports to extremely high standards” says YouTube user Selfbaptized. “Looks way better than I anticipated,” says another user.</p>



<h2 id="h-does-star-wars-outlaws-on-switch-2-run-poorly">Does Star Wars Outlaws on Switch 2 Run Poorly?</h2>



<p>According to some media outlets, though, who were given the opportunity to play the game on the Switch 2 at PAX West 2025, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/star-wars-outlaws-switch-2-port-reportedly-performed-poorly-ahead-of-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Star Wars Outlaws didn’t have great performance</a>. According to those in attendance, the game’s framerate dropped below 30 FPS on multiple occasions.</p>



<p>Media outlets were apparently not allowed to record gameplay, with those getting hands-on saying that the game was “king of rough”. </p>



<p>Whether the game runs well or not remains to be seen, but the 40 minutes of Star Wars Outlaws gameplay uploaded to YouTube do look like it runs rather well.</p>



<p>A <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-cancelled-star-wars-outlaws-sequel-early/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Star Wars Outlaws sequel</a>, which Insider Gaming understands was in the very early stages of development, was canceled due to the game not meeting internal expectations. </p>



<p>Star Wars Outlaws is set to launch on the Nintendo Switch 2 on September 4, 2025. Will you be giving it a play? Let us know through the official&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums</a>&nbsp;discussion.</p>

<p>Nintendo and Lego are back with yet another enticing collaboration; this time presenting a 421-piece replica of the iconic Game Boy.</p>
<p>Launching on <strong>1st October 2025</strong> at <strong>£54.99 / $59.99</strong>, the new set will come with the Game Boy itself, two cartridges for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gameboy/super_mario_land">Super Mario Land</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gameboy/legend_of_zelda_links_awakening">The Legend of Zelda: Link's Awakening</a>, and lenticular 'screens' that make it look like you're actually playing a game. Pretty cool!</p>
<p>Now, thanks to Lego reviewer <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@TiagoCatarino/videos">Tiago Catarino</a> over on YouTube, we've got our best look yet at the upcoming set. The 9-minute review provides a solid overview of the components, noting how the size of the console and cartridges is remarkably close to the real deal.</p>
<p>We also get a glimpse at how the lenticular sleeves are inserted into the main device, along with a demonstration of how the face buttons and d-pad work – yes, you can press them. We reckon it's only a matter of time until someone mods this thing to play real Game Boy games.</p>
<p>Nintendo and Lego really knocked it out of the park with their <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2020/07/nintendo_officially_unveils_the_lego_nes_console_launches_next_month">NES replica set</a>, so we've got high hopes for this one. It's also, dare we say, quite affordable compared to some of the stuff Lego has put out over the years.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nintendo-switch-2-handles-star-wars-outlaws-surprisingly-well-in-docked-mode.1285560/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 seems to handle <a href="https://wccftech.com/star-wars-outlaws-title-update-1-6-rtxdi/">Star Wars Outlaws</a> surprisingly well, delivering a solid experience in docked mode.</p>



<p>Early docked footage of the open-world game released last year on PC, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S surfaced online, providing a good look at how the console handles the game in both its linear and open-world segments. While the footage makes it clear plenty of compromises had to be made to get the game running on the new generation Nintendo console, Star Wars Outlaws seems to keep to its 30 FPS cap, resulting in a decent enough performance in docked mode. No handheld footage was shared, however, so it remains to be seen if the system will be able to deliver a decent experience on the go.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Star Wars Outlaws Switch 2 Gameplay" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bhNIf6ZWTwQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>In its launch window, the Nintendo Switch 2 is set to receive plenty of third-party ports, and some of them, like the <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-nintendo-switch-2-pc-settings-excellent-port/">Cyberpunk 2077 port</a>, have shown the level of image quality and performance the system can achieve with proper optimization. In the coming months, the next-generation system by Nintendo will receive a few other ports, and some of them are seemingly set to be at the opposite ends of the spectrum, in terms of quality. The Final Fantasy VII Remake Nintendo Switch 2 port will likely be among the best ports, achieving a higher level of quality than the original PlayStation 4 version, which is definitely impressive for a handheld system. On the other hand, Elden Ring: Tarnished Edition already doesn't seem to be faring well, possibly due to <a href="https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-tarnished-edition-performance-cpu-limitations/">CPU limitations</a> and the fact that the game's engine will effectively be its first port for the ARM platform.</p>



<p>Though port quality may differ, the Nintendo Switch 2 offers a lot of improvements over its predecessor. You can learn more about the system by checking out Chris's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/nintendo-switch-2-console/">review.</a></p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/stardew-valley">Stardew Valley</a> will get at least one more significant game update, says Eric "ConcernedApe" Barone, mere months after <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/eric-barone-the-guy-who-cant-stop-updating-stardew-valley-says-the-words-i-might-eventually-make-a-stardew-valley-2">stating</a> that he doesn't "want to just be the Stardew Valley guy." It'll be called update 1.7, and the trimness of the numbering implies that it'll be a large one. For context, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/stardew-valleys-huge-update-16-brings-new-items-pets-and-progression-and-more-players-in-co-op">Stardew Valley update 1.6</a> brought eight player PC co-op, new crops, a lot more NPC dialogue, a mastery system, new pets, and the ability to give those pets hats (which <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/stop-putting-hats-on-your-pets-asks-stardew-valley-creator">caused a few problems</a>). 
</p>
<p>"Okay, I revealed this at the concert last night and now the cat's out of the bag, so I will confirm for everyone: There will be a Stardew Valley 1.7 update," Barone <a href="https://x.com/ConcernedApe/status/1961864959484412104">wrote on Xitter</a> over the weekend. "No release date, no estimate. But it's happening."

</p><p>Barone is theoretically also working on a brand new game, the more <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/stardew-valley-devs-next-game-haunted-chocolatier-will-be-more-combat-focused">combat-focussed</a> RPG <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/haunted-chocolatier">Haunted Chocolatier</a>, but Stardew Valley keeps luring him back, for there is always something else to fix or introduce, however daft. "It's just so much easier to just add more stuff to Stardew Valley than to make a whole new game from scratch," he said in May. "Because Stardew Valley, all the systems, the major systems, are already all done. That's the stuff that's not fun to do. When I make an update, it's like, throw in this, throw in that, let's add green rain. These random ideas I have. Whimsical ideas." 
</p>
<p>In Barone's defence, if I had made the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_best-selling_PC_games">fourth best-selling premium PC game of all time</a>, I would feel in no great rush to move on from it. I would tinker for years. Well, I mean, I would actually take a lot of holidays. But in between all those trips to Alton Towers and when not playing <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/micro-machines">Micro Machines</a> in my bedroom-sized caramel fondue, I would do plenty of tinkering. Ah, I imagine George R. R. Martin wishes he could be updating the old GOT novels instead of writing The Winds Of Winter.

O'Connor first worked at Rare on Conker's Bad Fur Day for the N64. She later worked at the studio as head of animation and its incubation director, responsible for innovation.
</p>
<p>
Everwild was first revealed in 2019 as the next big project from Rare. It <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-the-new-everwild-trailer">surfaced again in 2020 with a trailer</a> (above) featuring gorgeous environments and creatures, but little was seen aftewards until its cancellation.

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/left-4-dead">Left 4 Dead</a> creator Mike Booth has announced he is working on a new four-player co-op shooter.</p>
<p>In a post shared on reddit over the weekend, Booth said the upcoming game will be "built on the foundations of what made [Left 4 Dead] special", though he stopped short of giving his new project a name or indeed any concept art.</p>
<p>However, in the words of the developer, "if you enjoyed the teamwork, tension, and replayability of my past games, you'll probably find this one interesting".</p>

<p>Ah, a blockade</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>We are mere days away from the Switch 2's next big port, with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/star-wars-outlaws">Star Wars Outlaws</a> gearing up for a hyperspace exit on <strong>4th September</strong>. Ubisoft has been pretty shy with Switch 2 footage so far (bar a sizzle reel appearance in the console's reveal Direct, and another brief look back in July), and if initial impressions are to be believed, there might be a good reason for that.</p>
<p>Outlaws' Switch 2 port has arrived at PAX West, giving all those in attendance the first chance to see how Kay Vess' planet-hopping adventure fares on the new Nintendo hardware. One such person to go hands-on with the game was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5JbnfU0SVs">GVG</a>'s Steve Bowling, who, despite revealing that Ubisoft allowed no direct-feed capture or over-the-shoulder recording during the preview, assembled his thoughts into a YouTube video. Unsurprisingly, it doesn't sound great.</p>
<p>According to Bowling, Outlaws runs "pretty poorly" on Switch 2, with both the game's resolution and framerate taking a hit to account for the scope of the open world and the technology under the hood. What's all the more concerning is that this comes despite the majority of the demo taking place in a relatively enclosed area — the early Imperial ship escape.</p>
<p>Even in these smaller environments, Bowling noted the "unstable, uncapped framerate", which apparently dropped below 30fps at several points during the demo. In a larger dogfight section, Bowling notes that the game simply "didn't look very remarkable", despite the ray-traced lighting and DLSS providing some neat visuals in more intimate moments.</p>
<p>All in all, it sounds like we might be in for a bumpy ride when this one arrives on Switch 2 later this week — heck, we have to assume that the PAX West demo is the finished version of the game with that tight of a turnaround. We'll be able to see it for ourselves soon enough, though we're getting those expectations tempered.</p>

            <p>Team Cherry have confirmed release times and price points for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hollow-knight-silksong">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a>. It'll cost $19.99, €19.99 and ¥2300 at launch on Thursday 4th September, with pricing for other regions such as the UK to follow. As an indication, the above pricepoints equate to around £17, but I wouldn't be surprised if they charged £19.99 for it, purely for the sake of symmetry.
</p>
<p>It's traditional among games journalists to illustrate pricepoints in terms of high street chain cups of coffee. But this is Silksong, a game anticipated as fervently as the ancient Mayans once anticipated the coming of an eclipse, so I will resort to more ornate means of comparison: Silksong will cost you 4200000th as much as a B-52 Stratofortress. It will cost you three-sixteenths of your soul on a rainy Friday, or two-sixteenths if the sun is out. It will cost you considerably less than they could probably charge for it. I'm not saying we should be grateful, mind, but we can breathe a sigh of a relief that this isn't being published by EA, Take-Two or Microsoft.
</p><!--more-->
<p>The game will launch on 7am PT, 10am ET, 3pm BST, and 4pm CEST this Thursday. This means that North American players can take the whole day off so as to rise and shove their gloating faces into Hornet's adventure, very first thing. You won't even have to shower first, you bastards. Seething Brits and Europeans must twiddle their thumbs in apoplexy till mid-afternoon, while the poor, sleepless Japanese seemingly won't get access till 11pm Tokyo time, if I'm converting the timezones correctly.
</p>
<p>James was recently able to actually play Silksong at Gamescom, finding it <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hollow-knight-silksong-is-faster-prettier-and-harder-yet-still-feels-like-a-safe-sequel">both enjoyable and familiar</a>. "The upside of playing it safe is that absolutely nothing has compromised what made the first game's action a tactile pleasure: its abnormally fine-tuned controls and pin-sharp audio/visual feedback on hits and jumps," James wrote.
</p><p>We had a bit of a ride with the original <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hollow-knight">Hollow Knight</a>. Back in 2017, John Walker (RPS in peace) <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hollow-knight-review">recommended that people play Ori and the Blind Forest</a> instead. This caused quite the hullabaloo over the subsequent eight years. My sage and considered verdict in hindsight is that they're both mid and you should play <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/animal-well">Animal Well</a>. Here's to another eight years!</p>

<p>Star Wars Outlaws is scheduled to release for the Switch 2 on September 4, 2025, and just days ahead of launch, the game’s performance might not be up to standard. </p>



<p>Star Wars Outlaws for the Nintendo Switch 2 was announced during the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/star-wars-outlaws-nintendo-switch-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Partner Showcase</a> on July 31. Outlaws will be the first Ubisoft game to arrive for the new console. However, a new report reveals that the game’s performance is not the best, even with the release less than a week away.</p>



<h2 id="h-star-wars-outlaws-switch-2-framerate-dropped-several-times-below-30fps">Star Wars Outlaws Switch 2 Framerate Dropped Several Times Below 30FPS</h2>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://gamerant.com/star-wars-outlaws-switch-2-version-performance-issues-low-frame-rate/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GameRant</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A5JbnfU0SVs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GVG</a> was present at PAX West 2025, where they were able to try Star Wars Outlaws for the Switch 2. Their new YouTube video states that Nintendo had all the games from Gamescom 2025 on display at PAX West 2025, with the only exception being Star Wars Outlaws. They were able to test the Star Wars Outlaws at this event, but were not allowed to capture any gameplay footage of the demo version.</p>



<p>GVG was not allowed even to have over-the-shoulder cameras to record footage; the only option was to play it and discuss it. Once, they played Star Wars Outlaws on the Switch 2, and it was evident that the performance was “kind of rough.” The video adds that Star Wars Outlaws runs “pretty poorly on the Switch 2.” </p>



<p>The demo only featured close sequences that included a Star Destroyer and a space fight. No open-world sequences were available, and even in the closed sequences, the framerate dropped below 30fps several times. The video clarifies that there was no way to analyse the drops as no footage was recorded, but the drops felt significant. </p>

            <p>
Lego is set to release a collection of Pokémon-themed sets next year, which will reportedly be among the most expensive to date.
</p>
<p>
The collection was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/lego-pokemon-announced-coming-2026">officially revealed by Lego in March this year</a>, with an intended release in 2026. Now, in a post on the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Legoleak/comments/1n47qnb/pokemon_72153_piece_count_price_source_reddit/">Legoleak reddit page</a>, it's reported the sets will arrive on general sale on 1st March (with a 27th February release for Insiders).
</p>
<p>
What's more, the biggest of the three sets will be 6838 pieces and cost a whopping $649.99. The remaining two sets will be $59.99 for a 587 piece set, and $199.99 for a 2050 piece set.

<p>
It's unknown exactly what these sets will be, but if these prices and piece counts are correct, it suggests this won't be a simple Pikachu minifigure. Perhaps we'll see a single large character design, like the Bowser set? Or a huge gym or town display?
</p>
<p>
For reference, The Mighty Bowser set is £229.99 for 2807 pieces, while the Lord of the Rings Barad-dûr set is £399.99 for 5471 pieces, and the Zelda Great Deku Tree is £259.99 for 2500 pieces.
</p>
<p>
Lego and Nintendo have seen big success with their <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/lego-super-mario-kart-sets-will-be-ready-to-race-in-2025">Mario</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/legend-of-zelda-great-deku-tree-lego-set-officially-revealed-by-nintendo">Zelda</a>, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/kk-slider-coming-to-new-lego-animal-crossing-sets">Animal Crossing</a> sets. Clearly they're expecting the Pokémon sets to be even more popular.

<p>These claims were made by modder Dee Keyes in a Twitter post put up over the same weekend that the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-skyrim-mods">Skyrim mod</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/skyblivion-project-lead-says-release-date-reveals-finally-getting-closer-as-oblivion-remake-mod-shows-off-revamped-intro">showed off its opening fifteen minutes</a> as part of Elder Scrolls modding showcase <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@CreationModCon/featured">Creation Mod Con</a>. Keyes is currently listed as a world designer on the <a href="https://skyblivion.com/the-team/">team page of Skyblivion's website</a>, having previously served as level design department lead, and has appeared in the likes of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nV2yDO7V8SQ">this dev diary</a> posted to project lead Kyle 'Rebelzize' Rebel's YouTube channel in 2021.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"Within the last 2-3 years the Skyblivion project has become less a passion project and more of a crunch project," Keyes wrote. "Where we used to explore options and put our heart and soul into an aspect of development, we're now being told left, right, and center that it doesn't need to be anything special or the usual 'no one is gonna notice this' excuse for rushing and laziness. It became harder and harder to talk to [project lead] Rebel about problems the project has or how little the developers are being told about lead decisions." </p>
<p>Keyes goes on to argue that announcing a 2025 release goal for the mod <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/oblivion-in-skyrim-mod-skyblivion-gets-a-2025-release-window-and-new-trailer">back in 2023</a> was a "massive mistake", claiming that it was driven by YouTuber and Skyblivion implementation lead Heavy Burns not wanting "to make another trailer unless it was a release[sic] date trailer". They go on to allege that Heavy Burns has taken on a much more prominent development role at Rebel's request, having been originally brought in to make trailers and dev diary videos, to the point they argue it "now feels like to all the devs that he's the one in charge". Keyes accuses Heavy Burns of dismissing their input, as well as gaslighting them and accusing them of being difficult to work with.</p><div>

</p></div>
<p>"In the last few months it has been impossible for me or [other] developers to convince Rebelzize that this release date is not possible," Keyes continued. "After a last ditch effort to ask one of the lead devs who was also stressed by the project's mismanagement to voice the concerns, only for them to be ignored and forced to leave too, I felt like my time at Skyblivion had come to an end." They conclude by again accusing Rebel and Heavy Burns of working with the goal of the team's efforts being "rushed out of the door" to meet a "pointless and unachievable release date".</p>
<p>"We weren't asking for extra time to add extra features," Keyes added in a <a href="https://x.com/Keyecomposer/status/1962015089457774602">reply to their initial post</a>. "Just the time to complete the MVP [minimum viable product] but instead it seemed like the MVP became more and more minimum by the day in order to make December."</p>
<p>I've contacted Keyes, Rebel, Heavy Burns, and the Skyblivion team for comment.</p>
<p>A couple of Skyblivion devs have already responded to Keyes' post being shared to the mod's Discord server and Reddit page. "We've made it clear our goal is to release this year; that being said, there is still work we need to finish," wrote Skyblivion communications specialist Evan T. Flatt on the latter platform. "Ultimately, Skyblivion will be released when the team is confident with it—our goal has been to have it ready for release this year.</p><p>"Now, what is 'ready'? That is an ongoing conversation we have been having because the nature of a fan-made passion project is that there has to eventually be a cut-off of adding cool new things. Right now, we all agree Skyblivion isn't ready (otherwise we would release it today). Our aim is that it will be by the end of the year, if we as a team decide that it isn't we will be sure to share that."</p>

</span></p><p>"Discussions will be had about the points brought up," Skyblivion navmesh developer Novarleeir <a href="https://discord.com/channels/239801644076892160/239801644076892160/1411834128478896301">added on Discord</a>. "For right now, the goal stands at 2025. At the end of the day, we'd like to provide a fun and entertaining experience for existing and incoming fans of Oblivion/Elder Scrolls."</p>
<p>In light of Keyes' post, an number of Skyblivion fans have posted in both places that they'd have no issue with the modders delaying Skyblivion out of this year and taking extra time, if that's judged by the team to be necessary. Given how important a trouble-free launch will likely be for Skyblivion, following the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/id-love-to-explore-more-of-fallout-londons-brilliant-world-but-it-keeps-crashing-every-few-minutes">bug issues</a> fellow massive mod <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fallout-london">Fallout: London</a> had on release last year, I'm very much inclined to agree.</p><p>Prior to Skyblivion's Creation Mod Con cameo this weekend just gone, project lead Rebel told RPS regarding the mod's release: "I'd say recent developments made us come closer to a potential date announcement, but we will be able to share more about that at a later date."</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nintendo-switch-direct-will-take-place-in-september-it%E2%80%99s-claimed.1285515/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>A reliable source has claimed that a Nintendo Direct is scheduled for the second week of September 2025. </p>



<p>The last Nintendo Direct was hosted in July 2025, and it was a partner showcase that featured 25 minutes of announcements from Nintendo’s publishing partners. Since then, SwitchForce has <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/rumors-of-the-next-nintendo-direct-pick-up-steam/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">claimed</a> that another Nintendo Direct showcase is planned for the second week of September, and another insider has just corroborated the information. </p>



<h2 id="h-the-next-nintendo-direct-should-arrive-in-the-second-week-of-september">The Next Nintendo Direct Should Arrive in the Second Week of September</h2>



<p>The corroboration about September’s Nintendo Direct comes from the reliable leaker, NateTheHate, through his latest post on <a href="https://x.com/NateTheHate2/status/1962214416339833244" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (formerly Twitter). Nate has stated, “Yes, there is a Nintendo Direct in September.” The insider added that it will be held in the “second week of the month”. And, it would be “in the latter half on or around Sept 11 or 12th.” </p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Yes, there is a Nintendo Direct in September. </p><p>When: The second week of the month, in the latter half on or around Sept 11 or 12th.</p></div>— NateTheHate2 (@NateTheHate2) <a href="https://twitter.com/NateTheHate2/status/1962214416339833244?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 31, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>



<p>In the same thread, a user has also asked whether the Red Dead Redemption 2 Switch 2 port will be announced at this direct. To which Nate responded, stating, “Maybe? Depends if Nintendo was able to court Rockstar.” The insider added that RDR2’s Switch 2 port is “bound regardless of announcement/reveal venue.” </p>



<p>It is hard to tell which games will be at this event, but we have several Switch 2 titles releasing in the October/November period, including Pokémon Legends: Z-A, Kirby Air Riders, Borderlands 4, Little Nightmares III, and more. Regardless, players should take the information about the Switch 2 Direct with a grain of salt as it doesn’t come from an official source. </p>



<p>In other news, Cyberpunk 2077 <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/cyberpunk-2077-sold-more-physical-copies-on-nintendo-switch-2-than-digital/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sold more physical copies</a> on the Nintendo Switch 2 than digital. Also, Final Fantasy 7 Remake Intergrade will release for the Switch 2 <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/final-fantasy-7-intergrade-coming-to-nintendo-switch-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in 2025</a>. What are your thoughts on a Nintendo Direct arriving in the second week of September?

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">The fate of PlayStation's upcoming live-service game <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/fairgame"><u>Fairgames</u></a> is once again under scrutiny as its creative director, Daniel Drapeau, has confirmed he has left Haven Studios to join Warner Bros. Games Montreal.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's the second high-profile exit of the summer, with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-live-service-woes-continue-as-playstation-executive-jade-raymond-exits-fairgames-developer-after-external-test-sparked-concern]"><u>studio founder Jade Raymond also exiting back in May</u></a>, several weeks after an external playtest reportedly met a lukewarm response.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"As of this week, I joined WB Games Montreal Inc. as creative director," Drapeau announced in a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7358635412245868544/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>LinkedIn post</u></a>. "I can't wait to start this wonderful adventure with all the great people here at the studio. I also want to particularly thank Yves Lachance, Logan A. Lesage, and Bryan Theberge for their trust and support throughout the process. Now, let's do this!"</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The news follows a rocky time for the game's development, and incorrect industry speculation surrounding its future. Last month, analyst Michael Pachter wrongly claimed the game had been canceled, though was later forced to <a href="https://x.com/DestinLegarie/status/1956792553954771444" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>walk back his statement</u></a> and admit he had "no info on the game at all."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Neither Haven nor Sony have commented publicly on Drapeau's departure.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Regardless, the news will hardly restore confidence in PlayStation's embattled live service ambitions. Sony announced plans in February 2022 to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-playstation-to-launch-more-than-10-live-service-games-by-2026"><u>launch more than 10 live service games by March 2026</u></a>, later saying <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/playstations-10-live-service-games-will-be-from-different-genres-and-for-different-audiences"><u>the push would bring games of different genres to different audiences</u></a>. It spent big on studio buyouts as part of the drive, bringing in Destiny developer Bungie, the now shuttered Firewalk Studios, and, of course, Haven Studios.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Firewalk, you'll remember, was the studio behind <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/concord"><u>Concord</u></a>, one of the biggest disasters in PlayStation history. Just a couple of weeks after it launched to eye-wateringly low player numbers, Sony decided to kill the game entirely and shortly thereafter shut down its development studio.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Concord flop came after Sony had already canceled Naughty Dog’s The Last of Us multiplayer game. And earlier this year, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/playstation-cancels-two-unannounced-live-service-games"><u>Sony reportedly canceled two unannounced live-service games</u></a>, one a God of War title in development at Bluepoint, the other in the works at Days Gone developer Bend.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">On the flip side, Arrowhead’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/helldivers-ii"><u>Helldivers 2</u></a> has been a breakout hit, and became the fastest-selling PlayStation Studios game of all time with 12 million copies sold in just 12 weeks. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fairgames — stylized as Fairgame$ — is described as "a competitive modern heist game where you team up to break into exotic locations and steal the cargo." The twist is that you not only need to outsmart guards and security systems, but you also need to compete against other teams, too. There's no word yet on when it'll launch.

Xbox recently priced the highly-anticipated <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-outer-worlds-2">The Outer Worlds 2</a> for $80 — the first of its games to break the typical $70 ceiling — but after a furious backlash, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-u-turns-on-the-outer-worlds-2-80-price-point-reverting-to-70-and-reimbursing-pre-order-customers">ended up dropping the pre-order price to $70 "in line with current market conditions."</a></p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">That's not all, either. The team also revealed exactly when we'll get to play it, too: 7am PT, 10am ET, 4pm CEST, and 11pm JST. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Team Cherry finally revealed a release date for the long-awaited Hollow Knight: Silksong at gamescom: <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hollow-knight-silksong-finally-has-a-release-date"><u>September 4, 2025</u></a>. We learned the news via a nearly two-minute new trailer dropped by Team Cherry, which showed a ton of new footage from the game. We see Hornet exploring, loads of new insectoid NPCs, dreary graveyards, swamps, a bustling city, new enemies, new bosses, an Ori-style escape sequence, and more. It'll be available on PC, Switch, Switch 2, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">At the same time, we learned <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/hollow-knight"><u>the original game</u></a> has <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hollow-knight-reaches-15-million-copies-sold"><u>managed to top 15 million copies sold</u></a>, a rare feat indeed for an independent game.

                <p>There's something deliciously smug about wielding the best <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/terraria/">Terraria</a> ranged weapons. While melee players are sweating it out in close quarters and mages are chugging mana potions like they're at an all-night rave, you're standing comfortably out of reach, raining down arrows, bullets, or bees with barely a scratch on your armor. It's the class for anyone who enjoys watching health bars melt while staying three steps ahead of the danger.</p><p dir="ltr">That's not to say it's easy. Ranged combat is a balancing act between conserving ammo, picking the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/best-terraria-accessories-for-melee-ranged-magic-and-summoner/1100-6533074/">best Terraria accessories</a> for your build, and stocking up on enough arrows or bullets to avoid the dreaded "click" of an empty chamber mid-boss fight. But when it all comes together, nothing feels quite as powerful. From simple ore bows to weapons that literally summon storms, the marksman's journey is one of precision, chaos, and plenty of smug grins.</p><div data-embed-type="toc"><p><span><strong>Table of Contents</strong> [<a data-toggle="collapse" href="#toc_list">hide</a>]</span></p><ul id="toc_list"><li><a href="#Pre_Hardmode">Pre-Hardmode</a><ul><li><a href="#Platinum_Bow">Platinum Bow</a></li><li><a href="#The_Bee_s_Knees">The Bee's Knees</a></li><li><a href="#Hellwing_Bow">Hellwing Bow</a></li></ul></li><li><a href="#Hardmode">Hardmode</a><ul><li><a href="#Daedalus_Stormbow">Daedalus Stormbow</a></li><li><a href="#Onyx_Blaster">Onyx Blaster</a></li><li><a href="#Phantasm">Phantasm</a></li><li><a href="#S_D_M_G_">S.D.M.G.</a></li></ul></li></ul></div><h2 dir="ltr" id="Pre_Hardmode">Pre-Hardmode</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1859/18592978/4554261-best-terraria-ranged-weapons-platinum-bow.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4554261" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1859/18592978/4554261-best-terraria-ranged-weapons-platinum-bow.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4554261"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1859/18592978/4554261-best-terraria-ranged-weapons-platinum-bow.jpg"></figure><h3 dir="ltr" id="Platinum_Bow">Platinum Bow</h3><ul><li dir="ltr"><strong>Damage: 13</strong></li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Knockback: 0</strong></li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Critical chance: 4%</strong></li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Speed: 25 (Fast)</strong></li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Velocity: 6.6</strong></li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Ammo: Arrows</strong></li></ul><p dir="ltr">Forget the wooden twig you start with, as the Platinum Bow is your first taste of real power. Made from just eight Platinum Bars, it delivers enough punch to make the Eye of Cthulhu feel more like target practice than a boss fight. It's easy to craft, doesn't ask much of you beyond a bit of mining, and instantly transforms you from hapless survivor into a hunter who means business. Pair it with Flaming Arrows for a fiery upgrade or Jester's Arrows to pierce crowds, and you'll sail through those chaotic early nights.</p><p dir="ltr">It's not flashy, but that's exactly the appeal. Early ranged combat is about consistency, and the Platinum Bow never lets you down. Think of it as your training wheels before Terraria decides to throw a real challenge at you. You'll eventually outgrow it, but for a weapon you can forge on day two, it's absurdly good at keeping you alive and on the front foot.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1859/18592978/4554262-best-terraria-ranged-weapons-the-bees-knees.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4554262" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1859/18592978/4554262-best-terraria-ranged-weapons-the-bees-knees.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4554262"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1859/18592978/4554262-best-terraria-ranged-weapons-the-bees-knees.jpg"></figure><h3 dir="ltr" id="The_Bee_s_Knees">The Bee's Knees</h3><ul><li dir="ltr"><strong>Damage: 23</strong></li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Knockback: 3</strong></li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Critical chance: 4%</strong></li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Speed: 23 (Fast)</strong></li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Velocity: 8</strong></li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Ammo: Arrows</strong></li></ul><p dir="ltr">Every ranged player remembers the first time they loosed an arrow with The Bee's Knees and watched the screen fill with buzzing chaos. Dropped by Queen Bee, this jungle treasure transforms plain old Wooden Arrows into swarms of homing bees that ricochet off walls and sting anything unlucky enough to be nearby. Suddenly, accuracy doesn't matter quite so much because you can just fire in the general direction of trouble and let your insect army handle the rest.</p><p dir="ltr">It's perfect for messy fights. Goblin Army invasion? Bees everywhere. Skeletron's skull and hands? Our friendly Bumbles chew through them like paper. Even <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/all-terraria-bosses-in-order/1100-6532648/">Terraria bosses</a> that usually require tight aim feel easier because your insect army simply doesn't miss. It's not the most elegant weapon, but it's certainly one of the most fun, and mid-game Terraria is exactly where a bit of spectacle makes the grind feel worthwhile.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1859/18592978/4554263-best-terraria-ranged-weapons-hellwing-bow.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4554263" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1859/18592978/4554263-best-terraria-ranged-weapons-hellwing-bow.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4554263"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1859/18592978/4554263-best-terraria-ranged-weapons-hellwing-bow.jpg"></figure><h3 dir="ltr" id="Hellwing_Bow">Hellwing Bow</h3><ul><li dir="ltr"><strong>Damage: 22</strong></li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Knockback: 5.5</strong></li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Critical chance: 4%</strong></li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Speed: 13 (Very Fast)</strong></li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Velocity: 6</strong></li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Ammo: Arrows</strong></li></ul><p dir="ltr">If you're heading into the Underworld, you'll want something with a bit of bite, and the Hellwing Bow more than delivers. Pulled from Shadow Chests, it transforms Wooden Arrows into fiery bats that pierce through everything in their path without slowing down. Suddenly, those cheap arrows you've been hoarding turn into deadly projectiles capable of hitting multiple enemies at once. When you're staring down the Wall of Flesh, those piercing bats feel like a cheat code.</p><p dir="ltr">It does take a little adjustment. The bats don't fly in perfectly straight lines like arrows, and their arcing paths can throw you off at first. But once you get the hang of it, the Hellwing Bow becomes indispensable. It's the ultimate pre-Hardmode boss killer, equipped with a single-click auto fire, which is usually reserved for Hardmode alternatives.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Hardmode">Hardmode</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1859/18592978/4554266-best-terraria-ranged-weapons-daedalus-stormbow.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4554266" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1859/18592978/4554266-best-terraria-ranged-weapons-daedalus-stormbow.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4554266"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1859/18592978/4554266-best-terraria-ranged-weapons-daedalus-stormbow.jpg"></figure><h3 dir="ltr" id="Daedalus_Stormbow">Daedalus Stormbow</h3><ul><li dir="ltr"><strong>Damage: 38</strong></li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Knockback: 2.25</strong></li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Critical chance: 4%</strong></li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Speed: 19 (Very Fast)</strong></li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Velocity: 12.5</strong></li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Ammo: Arrows</strong></li></ul><p dir="ltr">If there's one weapon that makes you feel like you've broken Terraria, it's the Daedalus Stormbow. Dropped by Hallowed Mimics, this unassuming bow calls down arrow rain from the heavens. Pair it with Holy Arrows, and suddenly you're orchestrating meteor showers of destruction. The Destroyer barely stands a chance as its segments are pummeled from above, each shot multiplying into falling stars. It's chaos, but the good kind.</p><p dir="ltr">What makes the Stormbow so beloved is that it rewards creativity. Build a flat arena, give the sky some clearance, and watch bosses dissolve under the deluge. Even with simpler arrows, it's wildly strong and feels almost unfair for early Hardmode.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1859/18592978/4554268-best-terraria-ranged-weapons-onyx-blaster.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4554268" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1859/18592978/4554268-best-terraria-ranged-weapons-onyx-blaster.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4554268"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1859/18592978/4554268-best-terraria-ranged-weapons-onyx-blaster.jpg"></figure><h3 dir="ltr" id="Onyx_Blaster">Onyx Blaster</h3><ul><li dir="ltr"><strong>Damage: 24</strong></li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Knockback: 6.5</strong></li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Critical chance: 4%</strong></li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Speed: 48 (Extremely Slow)</strong></li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Velocity: 14</strong></li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Ammo: Bullets</strong></li></ul><p dir="ltr">Don't be fooled by the damage drop-off on paper; the Onyx Blaster steps up as your mid-Hardmode workhorse. An upgrade to the Shotgun with two Dark Shards and 10 Souls of Night, this beast spits out a spread of bullets and follows it up with a dark explosive blast for good measure. Crafted with Souls of Night and Dark Shards, it's one of those weapons that feels purpose-built for mowing down anything in your path.</p><p dir="ltr">The best thing about the Onyx Blaster is how adaptable it is. Load it with Ichor Bullets to shred boss defenses or Crystal Bullets to split each shot into even more damage. The additional explosive dark projectile guarantees impact even if your spread misses, which makes it forgiving in hectic battles. It's the kind of mid-game weapon you'll hold onto long after you technically have upgrades, simply because it's that satisfying to use.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1859/18592978/4554269-best-terraria-ranged-weapons-phantasm.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4554269" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1859/18592978/4554269-best-terraria-ranged-weapons-phantasm.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4554269"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1859/18592978/4554269-best-terraria-ranged-weapons-phantasm.jpg"></figure><h3 dir="ltr" id="Phantasm">Phantasm</h3><ul><li dir="ltr"><strong>Damage: 50</strong></li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Knockback: 2</strong></li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Critical chance: 4%</strong></li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Speed: 12 (Very Fast)</strong></li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Velocity: 20</strong></li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Ammo: Arrows</strong></li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Bonus: 66% chance to save ammo</strong></li></ul><p dir="ltr">Near the top of the ranged food chain sits the Phantasm, a bow that spits arrows out in torrents. Crafted from 18 Vortex Fragments in an Ancient Manipulator, it launches rapid volleys, each shot spawning bonus homing arrows for free. The effect is overwhelming. Your screen fills with arrows, bosses evaporate under constant pressure, and suddenly you feel less like an archer and more like a living artillery cannon.</p><p dir="ltr">Of course, it's hungry. You have a small chance each shot to save ammo, but the Phantasm otherwise eats arrows faster than you can craft them. Some may say that's part of the charming challenge. Fortunately, you won't need many to humiliate your enemies, especially with Luminite Arrows in your pocket. This is the ranged endgame fantasy, granting you the smug satisfaction of watching the Moon Lord melt like butter.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1859/18592978/4554270-best-terraria-ranged-weapons-s-d-m-g.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4554270" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1859/18592978/4554270-best-terraria-ranged-weapons-s-d-m-g.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4554270"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1859/18592978/4554270-best-terraria-ranged-weapons-s-d-m-g.jpg"></figure><h3 dir="ltr" id="S_D_M_G_">S.D.M.G.</h3><ul><li dir="ltr"><strong>Damage: 85</strong></li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Knockback: 2.5</strong></li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Critical chance: 14%</strong></li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Speed: 5 (Extremely Fast)</strong></li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Velocity: 12</strong></li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Ammo: Bullets</strong></li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Bonus: 66% chance to save ammo</strong></li></ul><p dir="ltr">Beating the Moon Lord is no small feat, as the Space Dolphin Machine Gun is the perfect endgame gun to give you a pat on the back. Dropped by the big bad final boss, it boasts one of the fastest fire rates in the game and absurd base damage, meaning it can shred health bars before enemies even realize they're under attack. Despite its playful design, it's a powerhouse that turns bullets into a relentless stream of pain.</p><p dir="ltr">Of course, the S.D.M.G. has one big caveat: ammo. This thing chews through bullets faster than any other weapon, so keeping it fed becomes a logistical challenge. But when paired with high-end rounds like Luminite or Chlorophyte Bullets, the DPS is off the charts, so you shouldn't need to spend too many. It's strong, stylish, hilarious, and deeply satisfying to use.</p><p dir="ltr">Ranged combat is Terraria at its most efficient. Why risk your neck with other <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/all-terraria-weapon-types/1100-6533073/">Terraria weapon types</a> when you can fill the air with arrows, bullets, or bees and watch enemies crumble from a safe distance? Sure, you'll burn through ammo and your piggy bank might feel the strain, but few things compare to the feeling of staying untouched while bosses drop like clay pigeons.</p><p dir="ltr">Whether you're orchestrating divine arrow showers or letting a space dolphin unload on the Moon Lord, the marksman's path is one of precision and spectacle. It's chaotic, stylish, and just a little bit cheeky.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">A simple class that's also the most reckless, there's a skill curve to the best <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/terraria/">Terraria</a> melee weapons. Instead of hiding behind a staff or bow, you are charging face-first into danger, trading your health bar for glorious damage. It is the class for anyone who loves brute force, big crits, and feeling like a walking blender.</p><p dir="ltr">Getting up close and personal isn't just about swinging blindly. Terraria's melee arsenal is surprisingly diverse, ranging from oversized swords that cleave through entire boss arenas to yoyos, spears, boomerangs, and flails that control space. In true Terraria fashion, melee does not necessarily mean you need to be in the thick of the action. Plenty of the best blades sling projectiles across the screen when you jump from Pre-Hardmode to Hardmode, letting you play safe while keeping that melee identity.</p><div data-embed-type="toc"><p><span><strong>Table of Contents</strong> [<a data-toggle="collapse" href="#toc_list">hide</a>]</span></p><ul id="toc_list"><li><a href="#Pre_Hardmode">Pre-Hardmode</a><ul><li><a href="#Terragrim">Terragrim</a></li><li><a href="#Volcano">Volcano</a></li><li><a href="#Sunfury">Sunfury</a></li></ul></li><li><a href="#Hardmode">Hardmode</a><ul><li><a href="#Terra_Blade">Terra Blade</a></li><li><a href="#Solar_Eruption">Solar Eruption</a></li><li><a href="#Zenith">Zenith</a></li></ul></li></ul></div><h2 dir="ltr" id="Pre_Hardmode">Pre-Hardmode</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1859/18592978/4557928-best-terraria-melee-weapons-terragrim.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4557928" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1859/18592978/4557928-best-terraria-melee-weapons-terragrim.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4557928"></a><figcaption>Terragrim swings a small blade in front of the Terraria player's face.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1859/18592978/4557928-best-terraria-melee-weapons-terragrim.jpg"></figure><h3 dir="ltr" id="Terragrim">Terragrim</h3><ul><li dir="ltr">Damage: 17</li><li dir="ltr">Knockback: 3</li><li dir="ltr">Critical chance: 4%</li><li dir="ltr">Speed: 25 (Fast)</li></ul><p dir="ltr">Terragrim is the ultimate pre-boss jackpot. Found rarely in Enchanted Sword Shrines, it attacks at a speed so absurd that the modest damage stat barely matters. It is not craftable, it is not guaranteed, and it may never appear in your world, but if you are fortunate enough to stumble across one, it changes everything.</p><p dir="ltr">This blade's rapid swings chew through enemies before they can touch you, and against early <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/all-terraria-bosses-in-order/1100-6532648/">Terraria bosses</a> like Eye of Cthulhu, you'll feel untouchable. Terragrim is not a weapon you plan for; it's a sword that happens to you, but it is the clearest example of the sandbox game rewarding exploration with outrageous power spikes.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1859/18592978/4557929-best-terraria-melee-weapons-volcano.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4557929" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1859/18592978/4557929-best-terraria-melee-weapons-volcano.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4557929"></a><figcaption>Terraria player swinging the molten sword engulfed in fire overhead.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1859/18592978/4557929-best-terraria-melee-weapons-volcano.jpg"></figure><h3 dir="ltr" id="Volcano">Volcano</h3><ul><li dir="ltr">Damage: 40</li><li dir="ltr">Knockback: 6.5</li><li dir="ltr">Critical chance: 4%</li><li dir="ltr">Speed: 40 (Very Slow)</li></ul><p dir="ltr">Forged from Hellstone mined in the Underworld, the Volcano, otherwise known as the Fiery Greatsword on handheld platforms, is your midgame bruiser. It swings slowly but covers a huge arc, letting you tag multiple enemies at once while also applying the On Fire debuff for steady damage over time. Few pre-Hardmode swords feel as hefty in hand, and the extra reach gives you confidence against mobs that like to close space quickly.</p><p dir="ltr">More than just a strong weapon, Volcano is also a crucial ingredient in Night's Edge, itself the definitive pre-Hardmode sword. Even if you do not lean on it long term, crafting one is a natural step in melee progression. Think of it as a stepping stone and a statement that you are ready for Terraria's tougher encounters.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1859/18592978/4557931-best-terraria-melee-weapons-sunfury.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4557931" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1859/18592978/4557931-best-terraria-melee-weapons-sunfury.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4557931"></a><figcaption>Sunfury flings a flaming mace forward toward a Slime.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1859/18592978/4557931-best-terraria-melee-weapons-sunfury.jpg"></figure><h3 dir="ltr" id="Sunfury">Sunfury</h3><ul><li dir="ltr">Damage: 64</li><li dir="ltr">Knockback: 6.75</li><li dir="ltr">Critical chance: 11%</li><li dir="ltr">Speed: 45 (Very Slow)</li></ul><p dir="ltr">Sunfury is the most damaging melee weapon you can grab in Pre-Hardmode, full stop. Found in Shadow Chests or fished up from Obsidian Lock Boxes, this fiery flail swings through walls, pierces multiple enemies, and inflicts the On Fire debuff in addition to its initial smack. It makes quick work of events and bosses alike, letting you hold your ground instead of constantly dodging.</p><p dir="ltr">Unlike the Volcano, Sunfury also keeps you at a safer distance. The extended flail chain allows you to swap out tankiness for the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/best-terraria-accessories-for-melee-ranged-magic-and-summoner/1100-6533074/">best Terraria accessories</a> that boost damage, since you will not always be face-to-face with enemies.

Forged from True Excalibur, True Night's Edge, and the Broken Hero Sword, it fires a green wave on every swing, giving you full melee scaling while landing hits at range. The handling is crisp, the DPS is reliable, and it feels heroic from the first craft.</p><p dir="ltr">Use it to tidy post-Plantera progression, to farm Eclipse drops, and to steamroll events while you build toward endgame fragments. It is the Swiss Army Knife of melee weapons, blending crowd control with boss focus without asking for fancy setups, and just one of many ingredients for the best sword in the game.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1859/18592978/4557933-best-terraria-melee-weapons-solar-eruption.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4557933" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1859/18592978/4557933-best-terraria-melee-weapons-solar-eruption.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4557933"></a><figcaption>Solar Eruption ignores walls, bursting through the Jungle biome.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1859/18592978/4557933-best-terraria-melee-weapons-solar-eruption.jpg"></figure><h3 dir="ltr" id="Solar_Eruption">Solar Eruption</h3><ul><li dir="ltr">Damage: 105</li><li dir="ltr">Knockback: 6.75</li><li dir="ltr">Critical chance: 4%</li><li dir="ltr">Speed: 20 (Very Fast)</li></ul><p dir="ltr">Solar Eruption is a pillar craft that bends the rules in your favour. The flaming chain pierces, lingers, and hits through walls while applying the Daybroken debuff for even heavier damage over time than On Fire. Reach, safety, and uptime combine into a tool that trivializes many late fights.</p><p dir="ltr">Thread it through blocks to shred crowds and tag bosses from apparent safety. It is outstanding for events and pillar clearing, where cover and density would normally slow you down.

Crafted from a collection of ten iconic blades, including Terra Blade, Starfury, Seedler, Meowmere, Star Wraty, Influx Waver, The Horseman's Blade, Bee Keeper, Enchanted Sword, and the humble Copper Shortsword, it summons a storm of swords that chews through anything on screen. The performance is outrageous, and the animation feels like a reward for the entire journey.</p><p dir="ltr">Use it to close out moons, events, and farming with total authority. Zenith is deliberate excess, which is exactly the point. If you have assembled the lineage, you have earned the strongest toy in the sandbox.</p><p dir="ltr">Melee in Terraria is a journey from crude but satisfying swings to screen-filling spectacles. Pre-Hardmode gives you a taste of variety with blades that drop stars, flails that scatter mobs, and Night's Edge as the badge of progress. By Hardmode, your kit transforms into legendary blades and celestial crafts that let you fight from safety without ever losing the melee identity.</p><p dir="ltr">The appeal is simple. Compared to all other <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/all-terraria-weapon-types/1100-6533073/">Terraria weapon types</a>, you are always in the thick of it, standing toe to toe with bosses rather than hanging back. Every upgrade feels like a tangible power spike, and the final reward in Zenith is a pure celebration of everything you have built. If you enjoy high stakes, close calls, and the satisfaction of carving through enemies with your own two hands, melee is the class that never stops giving.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">Like any good manager, delegation is one of your best tools. The best <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/terraria/">Terraria</a> summoner weapons thrive not by swinging the sharpest blade or firing the fastest bullet, but by putting others to work. Each staff or whip you pick up is less about your own might and more about the team you assemble, from humble birds and frogs to celestial dragons. It is a playstyle built on patience and planning, rewarding those who prefer to orchestrate the fight rather than charge headfirst into it.</p><p dir="ltr">That is not to say life as a summoner is easy. The class often walks a fine line between feeling underpowered and overpowered, depending on the stage of the game and how well you support your minions with the right gear. But when it all clicks, few things match the satisfaction of watching an army you raised tear through bosses while you stand back, whip in hand, guiding the carnage.</p><p dir="ltr">Before we get into the journey best taken from Pre-Hardmode to Hardmode, it's worth understanding the difference between a minion and a sentry. Sentries are stationary, stronger for defending a single point during wave-based events, but require re-summoning if you relocate. Thanks to the added mobility, minions are generally better, following you into battle. It entirely depends on whether you prefer to lead from the back or the front. Regardless, you can summon multiple of the same unit to better stack your odds.</p><div data-embed-type="toc"><p><span><strong>Table of Contents</strong> [<a data-toggle="collapse" href="#toc_list">hide</a>]</span></p><ul id="toc_list"><li><a href="#Pre_Hardmode">Pre-Hardmode</a><ul><li><a href="#Finch_Staff">Finch Staff</a></li><li><a href="#Ballista_Rod">Ballista Rod</a></li><li><a href="#Vampire_Frog_Staff">Vampire Frog Staff</a></li><li><a href="#Imp_Staff">Imp Staff</a></li></ul></li><li><a href="#Hardmode">Hardmode</a><ul><li><a href="#Spider_Staff">Spider Staff</a></li><li><a href="#Queen_Spider_Staff">Queen Spider Staff</a></li><li><a href="#Raven_Staff">Raven Staff</a></li><li><a href="#Stardust_Dragon_Staff">Stardust Dragon Staff</a></li></ul></li></ul></div><h2 dir="ltr" id="Pre_Hardmode">Pre-Hardmode</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1859/18592978/4557949-best-terraria-summoner-weapons-finch-staff.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4557949" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1859/18592978/4557949-best-terraria-summoner-weapons-finch-staff.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4557949"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1859/18592978/4557949-best-terraria-summoner-weapons-finch-staff.jpg"></figure><h3 dir="ltr" id="Finch_Staff">Finch Staff</h3><ul><li dir="ltr">Damage: 7</li><li dir="ltr">Mana cost: 10</li><li dir="ltr">Knockback: 4</li><li dir="ltr">Velocity: 10</li><li dir="ltr">Speed: 36 (Very Slow)</li><li dir="ltr">Summon type: Minion</li></ul><p dir="ltr">The Finch Staff is the earliest taste of summoner life for many players, dropping from Living Trees with a bit of luck. It might not seem much at first, summoning a lone bird minion to hover overhead and peck at enemies, but it gives you a companion long before most other classes find something reliable. It is a gentle introduction to the idea of indirect combat, and a handy tool for those who want to feel like a summoner from the very start.</p><p dir="ltr">Stats are modest, with 7 base damage and zero knockback, meaning it will not carry you into midgame. Still, for something acquired almost immediately, it punches above its weight and provides a constant stream of chip damage that adds up in early fights. It is hardly spectacular, but it sets the tone for the summoner path and makes you hungry for stronger companions.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1859/18592978/4557950-best-terraria-summoner-weapons-ballista-rod.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4557950" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1859/18592978/4557950-best-terraria-summoner-weapons-ballista-rod.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4557950"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1859/18592978/4557950-best-terraria-summoner-weapons-ballista-rod.jpg"></figure><h3 dir="ltr" id="Ballista_Rod">Ballista Rod</h3><ul><li dir="ltr">Damage: 30</li><li dir="ltr">Mana cost: 5</li><li dir="ltr">Knockback: 4.7</li><li dir="ltr">Velocity: 1</li><li dir="ltr">Speed: 30 (Average)</li><li dir="ltr">Summon type: Sentry</li></ul><p dir="ltr">The Ballista Rod is obtained from the Tavernkeep once you have beaten the Goblin Army, and it marks the point where summoners begin to appreciate the power of sentries. Dropping a ballista turret changes how you approach fights, letting you cover choke points or add extra pressure in boss arenas with piercing bolts that subdue multiple enemies at once.</p><p dir="ltr">Unlike minions, sentries stay fixed to the ground, so clever placement becomes just as important as raw power. It takes some grinding to be able to summon more than one sentry at a time, such as the War Table granting the Strategist buff and increasing your capacity by one, but the benefit here is that this doesn't count towards your minion limit. Mix and match with multiple staves and you'll be well on your way to victory.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1859/18592978/4557951-best-terraria-summoner-weapons-vampire-frog-staff.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4557951" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1859/18592978/4557951-best-terraria-summoner-weapons-vampire-frog-staff.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4557951"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1859/18592978/4557951-best-terraria-summoner-weapons-vampire-frog-staff.jpg"></figure><h3 dir="ltr" id="Vampire_Frog_Staff">Vampire Frog Staff</h3><ul><li dir="ltr">Damage: 11</li><li dir="ltr">Mana cost: 10</li><li dir="ltr">Knockback: 5</li><li dir="ltr">Velocity: 10</li><li dir="ltr">Speed: 36 (Very Slow)</li><li dir="ltr">Summon type: Minion</li></ul><p dir="ltr">This is where pre-Hardmode summoning starts to get serious. The Vampire Frog Staff, obtained during the Blood Moon event by defeating Zombie Merman or Wandering Eye Fish, unleashes frogs that leap aggressively at enemies, tearing through them with surprising speed. They might not look intimidating, but these amphibians carry you further than any bird or slime, and suddenly the summoner class feels less like a gimmick and more like a viable playstyle.</p><p dir="ltr">Each frog deals 11 damage and strikes quickly, giving you rapid crowd control against swarms of enemies. For the pre-Hardmode stretch, they feel like a revelation. If you can survive the Blood Moon long enough to snag this staff, you will have one of the most dependable weapons of the entire early game.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1859/18592978/4557952-best-terraria-summoner-weapons-imp-staff.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4557952" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1859/18592978/4557952-best-terraria-summoner-weapons-imp-staff.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4557952"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1859/18592978/4557952-best-terraria-summoner-weapons-imp-staff.jpg"></figure><h3 dir="ltr" id="Imp_Staff">Imp Staff</h3><ul><li dir="ltr">Damage: 17</li><li dir="ltr">Mana cost: 10</li><li dir="ltr">Knockback: 2</li><li dir="ltr">Velocity: 10</li><li dir="ltr">Speed: 36 (Very Slow)</li><li dir="ltr">Summon type: Minion</li></ul><p dir="ltr">By the time you reach the Underworld, the Imp Staff becomes the standout pre-Hardmode choice. It is crafted with 17 Hellstone Bars, meaning you will need to brave lava lakes and fire imps, but the payoff is worth it. The summoned imps shoot fireballs from a distance, dealing reliable damage without getting into harm's way. It's a powerful weapon for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/all-terraria-bosses-in-order/1100-6532648/">Terraria boss fights</a>, particularly against the Wall of Flesh where constant ranged pressure makes all the difference.</p><p dir="ltr">With a strong base damage and piercing fireballs that cut through enemies, the Imp Staff stands head and shoulders above other pre-Hardmode options. Its ability to keep enemies at range is a marked improvement over frogs and slimes, and it transitions neatly into early Hardmode before you find something stronger.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Hardmode">Hardmode</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1859/18592978/4557953-best-terraria-summoner-weapons-spider-staff.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4557953" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1859/18592978/4557953-best-terraria-summoner-weapons-spider-staff.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4557953"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1859/18592978/4557953-best-terraria-summoner-weapons-spider-staff.jpg"></figure><h3 dir="ltr" id="Spider_Staff">Spider Staff</h3><ul><li dir="ltr">Damage: 26</li><li dir="ltr">Mana cost: 10</li><li dir="ltr">Knockback: 3</li><li dir="ltr">Velocity: 10</li><li dir="ltr">Speed: 36 (Very Slow)</li><li dir="ltr">Summon type: Minion</li></ul><p dir="ltr">Once you defeat the Wall of Flesh and enter Hardmode, the Spider Staff is often your first true upgrade. Pieced together from the 16 Spider Fans you farm from the new spider caves, the staff summons spiders that scuttle rapidly across the ground to overwhelm foes. These arachnids shred enemies at close range and make mechanical bosses far more manageable than they might otherwise be.</p><p dir="ltr">Each spider deals 26 damage with fast bites, and the fact that they stick to enemies makes them particularly effective against single targets. Their only drawback is their limited range, but inflicting the Acid Venom debuff for six health per second means they'll make short work of their current target. Add the right armour and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/best-terraria-accessories-for-melee-ranged-magic-and-summoner/1100-6533074/">best Terraria accessories</a>, and you can summon a small army to pave the way forward.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1859/18592978/4557954-best-terraria-summoner-weapons-queen-spider-staff.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4557954" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1859/18592978/4557954-best-terraria-summoner-weapons-queen-spider-staff.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4557954"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1859/18592978/4557954-best-terraria-summoner-weapons-queen-spider-staff.jpg"></figure><h3 dir="ltr" id="Queen_Spider_Staff">Queen Spider Staff</h3><ul><li dir="ltr">Damage: 26</li><li dir="ltr">Mana cost: 10</li><li dir="ltr">Knockback: 7.5</li><li dir="ltr">Velocity: 14</li><li dir="ltr">Speed: 30 (Average)</li><li dir="ltr">Summon type: Sentry</li></ul><p dir="ltr">Crafted from 24 Spider Fangs, this staff is an essential part of any Hardmode summoner's toolkit. It raises a sentry that shoots eggs, which explode on impact, cause damage over time via the Acid Venom debuff, and spawn two baby spiders that latch onto the enemy. Most importantly, sentries do not consume minion slots, so you can pair a Queen Spider turret with a full roster of minions for a devastating mix.</p><p dir="ltr">The barrage of eggs inflicting base damage and multiple spiders spawning to chip away at enemies make the Queen Spider Staff a constant source of supplementary damage that scales beautifully with your growing minion count.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1859/18592978/4557955-best-terraria-summoner-weapons-raven-staff.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4557955" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1859/18592978/4557955-best-terraria-summoner-weapons-raven-staff.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4557955"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1859/18592978/4557955-best-terraria-summoner-weapons-raven-staff.jpg"></figure><h3 dir="ltr" id="Raven_Staff">Raven Staff</h3><ul><li dir="ltr">Damage: 55</li><li dir="ltr">Mana cost: 10</li><li dir="ltr">Knockback: 3</li><li dir="ltr">Velocity: 10</li><li dir="ltr">Speed: 28 (Average)</li><li dir="ltr">Summon type: Minion</li></ul><p dir="ltr">When Pumpkins are falling and Halloween looms, the Raven Staff becomes a spooky powerhouse.

With enough summons in play, the screen quickly becomes a blur of feathers and strikes that would make Alfred Hitchcock proud.

Its constant sweeping attacks obliterate enemies and bosses alike, leaving little room for resistance. It is the definitive summoner's staff for endgame players, rising above just about <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/all-terraria-weapon-types/1100-6533073/" data-ref-id="1100-6533073">all Terraria weapons</a>, and a fitting reward for those who chose the path of delegation.</p><p dir="ltr">Summoner weapons transform Terraria into a different game, one where your success depends less on personal reflexes and more on the strength of your companions. From tiny birds and frogs in the early days to celestial dragons at the peak of power, these tools of delegation turn you into the ultimate battlefield commander. Master them, and you will never need to lift a sword again.</p>

            <p>The first season of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a>'s acclaimed anime spin-off Edgerunners is getting a physical Blu-ray release.</p>
<p>As shared by Crunchyroll, the anime box set is available to pre-order now, with an expected shipping date of 23rd October. It will retail in the US for $123.98 (I have not been able to find a UK specific release, though, with the current retail listing being region A).</p>

<p>For your money, you will receive (obviously) the entire first series, which is 10 episodes, across three discs. It also includes a storyboard booklet from director Hiroyuki Imaishi, a "special" booklet, three animation cel sheets and a two year anniversary poster (see image below).</p>
<p>"In a world of neon and the cybernetically enhanced, can David climb up from a lowly bourgie to become an edgerunning legend?" asks the official blurb. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cyberpunk-edgerunners-shows-cd-projekts-cyberpunk-is-still-worth-fighting-for">Eurogamer's former editor-in-chief Wesley Yin-Poole called the Cyberpunk anime "fantastic"</a> when he watched it back in 2022.</p>

<p>A second season of Edgerunners is now in the works at Netflix. It will comprise 10 episodes, and feature a standalone story within the world of Cyberpunk 2077.

<p>The recent Indie World showcase featured a rather curious word game for the Switch eShop, but chances are you may have missed it thanks to its initial exclusivity in Japan.</p>
<p>Fear not, dear reader! According to a new listing on the US eShop, '<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/word_game">文字遊戲 Word Game</a>' is heading to the West (well, the US, at least – we've not yet seen mention of it on the EU eShop), and it'll be available later today for <strong>$34.99</strong>. Whoa, whoa, <em>whoa</em>... Hold up, that seems a fairly hefty price for a word game, hm..? Yes, we were surprised too, and truth be told, we're not <em>100%</em> clear on what the actual objective is.</p>
<p>From what we can gather, this isn't your average word game like Scrabble or Boggle and whatnot. Instead, you actually control an animated Chinese character and make your way through a series of puzzles. It looks fairly basic for the most part, but there are also moments of true ingenuity in which the words animate into complete new objects or creatures. You have to see if in motion to really 'get it', we reckon.</p>
<p>Anyway, here's the official, totally-not-confusing description:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Word game is literally a game of words.</p>
<p>Words are not only composing narratives and interfaces, but also representing objects, characters and scenes.</p>
<p>Player controls "I" to challenge puzzles composed of words.</p>
<p>When "I" appears a secret room, in-game narrative clearly tells "I" that "there is no door”. However, in the world of word game, “I" can walk through the "door” because there is a “door”.</p>
<p>“I" should find clues between lines, delete words to change the meaning of sentences, or shift words to rewrite facts. “I” must be wise and brave enough complete the mission of words.</p>
<p>May the best "I” win!</p>
</blockquote>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>Echoes of the End is an action adventure game very much in the vein of the modern God of War series. You’ll find rocks to squeeze through, boats to explore watery areas, and other familiar bits of design between the two, but where Echoes differs the most is that it’s a fully linear game – imagine that? There’s distinct levels to complete and then move onto the next one rather than a huge open world to traipse through! The end result is a good game that could have been great… if it was more polished.</p>
<p><iframe title="Echoes of the End | Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/eDusaQf-zGU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The game begins with a brief yet ominous cutscene of a giant crystal thing being broken by a lady with magic powers. Then you meet your character, Ryn, and her brother Cor as they are checking on a ward – a smaller version of the giant crystal you just saw destroyed. Ryn is a vestige, someone with a dangerous power that is a remnant of a past age when this was common, but are now feared by people who don’t understand them. She is able to use this remnant power to check the ward, which unsurprisingly keeps enemies from invading because…magic. It doesn’t take long for Cor to end up kidnapped by the ominous magic lady, called Zara, and her boss Aurick, triggering a quest for Ryn to rescue her brother and stop the strangers.</p>


<p>It’s pretty standard fantasy stuff really, but the way it’s told and, most importantly, the relationship between a few of the characters help to elevate it a bit. Abram, who shows up immediately after Cor is kidnapped in one of those incredible narrative conveniences that you sometimes get in games like this, is the highlight along with Ryn. They have a lot of conversations throughout gameplay and they’re well written and introspective enough to have stopped me from continuing until it stopped just in case I trigger something that cut it off. I can’t really go into what these conversations are about due to spoilers, but just know that dialogue and story here are a highlight that I really enjoyed. There’s a moment or two that get genuinely emotional as well.</p>
<p>The game is often shockingly pretty. The landscapes of Aema are modelled on Iceland and are just disproportionately gorgeous. It’s not perfect, you’ll find a couple of low quality textures and, late in the game, a very low frame rate and slightly blurry fire animation that is used repeatedly in one particular area, but even then it’s a small fault in a beautiful landscape. There’s some variety to be found as you travel your way through snow, sand, and all the other usual suspects, though there was an acidic bog type area that I thought felt novel, even if it didn’t last too long. You might have seen them before, but some of these areas are amongst the best looking I’ve seen in games for a while, especially the massive, sweeping backgrounds that provide a staggering sense of scale.</p>


<p>Graphics and story are the only areas I can point to with little to fault in them unfortunately. Combat can be a lot of fun, and I was particularly glad that the attack animations of enemies weren’t incredibly deceptive in regards to parry/dodge timing, allowing me to pretty easily dodge incoming combo attacks. The powers you get, which include moving people around, slamming them into the ground, telekinetically throwing objects at them, aren’t unique, but are pretty entertaining and effective use of them can absolutely demolish a group of enemies you would struggle against without them.</p>
<p>That said, things don’t seem to flow properly. It feels like there’s moments in certain animations where your inputs are not registered – if you dodge an attack and press L2 to start aiming your telekinetic powers, it just doesn’t, instead leaving you standing there like an idiot not targeting anything, causing you to take a sword or talon to the face. This happens rarely and sometimes it happens with jumping or air-dashing. Now imagine carefully lining up a big jump and your double jump, a basic tool of the gaming trade, just doesn’t trigger when you press the button. It happens rarely enough that it doesn’t spoil the experience, but it’s hugely frustrating when it does.</p>

<p>Echoes of the End is a pretty challenging game on the regular difficulty. That’s fine when it works properly, but if you’re dropping my attack and dodge inputs then it’s only annoying. Because of this, dropping the difficulty made the game far more fun due to being more forgiving of “my” mistakes in combat. It’s a real shame because I enjoy it most of the time, there’s little more fun than hitting people in the face with their own friends. There are a few other complaints, mostly in regards to enemy variety, whilst there are a few different types, they’re used enough that they can get a little repetitive.</p>
<p>There’s a lot of puzzling to be found in Aema as well, with mostly positive results. Now, if you don’t like puzzles in games then you won’t like this one, as there are quite a few and, being a linear game, they’re mostly all necessary to progress. I, on the other hand, only mind poor puzzles in games and I’ve mostly enjoyed them, but for one series of puzzles that involved leaving a “ghost” of yourself that you could teleport to later, which I found to be a bit shallow after the first go. The puzzles in a general area/level tend to have a shared mechanic that you’ll move on from to another in the next, so at least any you won’t like won’t stick around for too long.</p>
<p>One issue is that dropping jump inputs in puzzles that involve jumping is very annoying, but thankfully it doesn’t happen too often and, when it does, you’re just teleported back where you jumped from, missing a bit of health. Even more rarer than this, you can slide off the edge of a platform if you’re not careful, but I only had this happen twice. In spite of these considerations, I have really enjoyed more of the puzzles in this game than I would normally expect, with a few that really stumped me at first before I worked my way to solutions that were particularly satisfying.</p>

<p>And then there’s the bugs. I’ve had a couple of crashes in my twelve hours of play – it’s not a very long game, there’s a trophy for finishing in under ten hours – but by far the most egregious bug happened to me twice. You know when you squeeze through a tight gap in a wall in what used to be a subtle loading screen? Well, twice when I did that in this game, I fell through the floor into the grey void below the map. There was also a bit where I landed my boat on an island, then stopped playing for the night. When I restarted the game I went through this island only to find no boat waiting for me at the dock, stopping me from progressing, potentially dooming Ryn and Abram to a Castaway-style existence where they are each other’s volleyball. This was fixed immediately in perhaps the most perfectly timed patch ever, which started downloading the first time I restarted the game to see if it would fix it.</p>
<p>While there are rough edges and frustrations from a lack of polish, I still really&nbsp; enjoyed Echoes of the End. Improving the flow of combat, working out some of the glitches and that poor fire animation would go most of the way to realising the game’s potential. The story is good and the characters, particularly Ryn and Abram are very well written and performed. And it all happens in a stunningly gorgeous, Icelandic fantasy world.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>September is stacked full of huge releases, and Borderlands 4 is undoubtedly one of the biggest, so we’ve got the details on whether you can dive into the game ahead of others with early access.</p>



<p>Releasing September 12, Borderlands 4 caught our eye in our <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/borderlands-4-preview-reveal-harlowe-demo-exclusive/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hands-on preview at Gamescom</a>, and Gearbox CEO Randy Pitchford has high hopes for the game, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/exclusive-randy-pitchford-100-million-units-borderlands-4/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">predicting over 100m sales</a>.</p>



<p>If you can’t contain your excitement for Borderlands 4 and want to know whether there is any way to jump the queue and play early, we’ve got all the details.</p>



<h2 id="h-can-you-play-borderlands-4-with-early-access">Can You Play Borderlands 4 With Early Access?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Landing with a bang. Image via Gearbox</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>No, there are not any early access options for Borderlands 4. As such, the release date and time are the same for everyone.</strong></p>



<p>While many other games adopt an early-access stance, often as a pre-order bonus for a higher-priced edition of the game, neither the Deluxe Edition nor the Super Deluxe Edition of <a href="https://borderlands.2k.com/en-GB/borderlands-4/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Borderlands 4</a> provide this incentive.</p>



<p>However, store listings for Borderlands 4 indicate the game will be <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/borderlands-4-release-date-start-time/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">staggered global release at midnight local time</a>, excluding Steam, so the doors won’t open for everyone at the same time.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-there-any-way-to-play-borderlands-4-early">Is There Any Way to Play Borderlands 4 Early?</h2>



<p><strong>Although there are no early access options for Borderlands 4, you may be able to play early by adjusting your time zone on your console.</strong></p>



<p>Xbox players have the easiest approach for the New Zealand trick, requiring only a change in location settings and restarting the console. With this approach, players will be able to play Borderlands 4 when the game launches in New Zealand, hours before the release time in their time zone.</p>



<p>PlayStation players can also take advantage of this approach, though it’s harder to do and potentially more costly. In order to play early on New Zealand, you must have a New Zealand account and purchase the game from the store in that region. However, you might not be able to transfer your save date over to your main account, so be careful.</p>



<p>Unfortunately for PC players, there’s no New Zealand trick and the Steam release, unlike on console, is set to be global at a set time. On the bright side, this does mean everyone on PC will start playing at the same time.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Skyblivion’s First 15 Minutes Shared in New Video]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/skyblivion-first-15-minutes-shared-new-video/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/skyblivion%E2%80%99s-first-15-minutes-shared-in-new-video.1285458/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Yesterday, Skyblivion Project Lead Rebelzize has shared the first fifteen minutes of the fan-made Oblivion remake in Skyrim's engine. This is the iconic tutorial section of the game, where the imprisoned main character accompanies Emperor Uriel Septim in his failed bid to escape from the Mythic Dawn's fated assassination. </p>



<p>The video's narrator notes the improved character models, including textures and hair, compared to the original Oblivion. Moreover, when picking ingredients in Skyblivion, they are visually removed in real time. The modding team has remade every armor, weapon, clothing, and miscellaneous item. The lockpicking mixes the original with some elements from the MMORPG The Elder Scrolls Online. Sound design has been enhanced, too. Weapons will feel more impactful when hitting foes, and there's new ambient music.</p>



<p>The Skyblivion team even worked hard to make the dungeons fit the region they're supposed to be in. For example, in the tutorial dungeon, players will spot the Imperial Isle above and hear local birds chirping through an opening in the ceiling. The remake's loading screens portray new 'interactive layered art,' while a combination of original and updated tooltips offers players guidance to the game's various systems. Both the birth sign user interface and class selection menu have been remade and look much improved over those in the original Oblivion game.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>This was just a taste of the remake and more will come soon, but the team is also still seeking volunteer help, especially from those users with experience in nav mesh, quest implementation, and UI design. Still, the 2025 release window (<span><a href="https://wccftech.com/skyblivion-total-conversion-mod-officially-set-for-2025-launch/" target="_blank">unveiled initi</a></span><a href="https://wccftech.com/skyblivion-total-conversion-mod-officially-set-for-2025-launch/">ally</a> in early 2023) remains the goal, as the modders prepare for one final push.</p>



<p>In other Elder Scrolls modding news, InfernoPlus has somehow <a href="https://wccftech.com/heres-morrowind-running-elden-ring-engine/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">managed to port The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind to the Elden Ring engine</a>, though the project is far from done.</p>

            <p>Daniel Drapeau, recently the game director on Fairgames at Haven Studios, has announced his new role as a creative director over at Warner Bros Montreal.</p>
<p>The move adds further doubt to the status of Fairgames, the live-service shooter published by Sony, following the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fairgames-reportedly-delayed-into-next-year-as-haven-founder-jade-raymond-exits">departure of studio founder Jade Raymond</a>.</p>
<p>Drapeau announced the change in a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7358635412245868544/">LinkedIn post</a>: "As of this week, I joined<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/wb-games-montreal-inc-/"> WB Games Montreal Inc.</a> as Creative Director. I can't wait to start this wonderful adventure with all the great people here at the studio. I also want to particularly thank<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/yves-lachance/"> Yves Lachance</a>,<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/loganalesage/"> Logan A. Lesage</a> and<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/bryan-theberge-aa26223/"> Bryan Theberge</a> for their trust and support throughout the process. Now, let's do this!"</p>

<p>There's no word on what game Drapeau is working on as of writing, as nothing is listed on his Linkedin. We do know that Warner Bros <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/warner-bros-games-is-working-on-another-live-service-game-despite-suicide-squad-flop">is working on a new live service title</a>, thanks to an executive producer job listing over at Warner Bros Montreal no less. Whether or not Drapeau is working on this project or something else entirely remains unconfirmed.</p><p>While this is a nice bit of news for Warner Bros Games, especially <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/warner-bros-games-restructures-leadership-team-following-new-focus-on-game-of-thrones-dc-harry-potter-and-mortal-kombat">given the recent overhaul of its leadership team</a>, it marks another wound for Fairgames. The game, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/jade-raymonds-studio-haven-announces-heist-shooter-fairgame">first announced in May 2023, has been a ghost ever since</a>, beyond Ramond's departure earlier this year.</p>

Now, this alone wouldn't be much cause for alarm, but <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/a-nintendo-direct-is-reportedly-planned-for-mid-september/">VGC</a> had also corroborated this and stated that its own sources have made mention of a Direct on this date.</p>
<p>Adding fuel to the fire, <a href="https://x.com/NateTheHate2/status/1962214416339833244">Nate the Hate</a>, a YouTuber / podcast host who has accurately predicted several Nintendo Direct presentations in the past, has now stated that a Direct will indeed take place in September.</p><div><figure data-videoid="4gZSQE4poJM" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4gZSQE4poJM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/4gZSQE4poJM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4gZSQE4poJM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed402431wnogvt&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4gZSQE4poJM" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>In an effort to seemingly give himself a little room for error, however, Nate the Hate has said that the showcase will take place in the "second week of the month, in the latter half on or around Sept 11 or 12th".</p>

<p>It's not the most outrageous prediction imaginable; after all, given that we've yet to receive release dates for the likes of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/metroid-prime-4-beyond-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment">Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment</a>, both of which are scheduled for '2025' and 'Winter' respectively, it's reasonable to assume that we'll be getting a Direct pretty soon.</p>
<p>In addition, of course, Mario himself is celebrating his 40th anniversary this month, with the original <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nes/super_mario_bros">Super Mario Bros.</a> on NES having launched in Japan on, wait for it... 13th September 1985. So yeah, a Direct in September to coincide with this seems pretty safe, no?</p>
<p>Still, folks have been wrong in the past, so we'll just have to wait and see. We reckon it's notable that we now have multiple sources pointing to roughly the same date, so let's all keep our eyes peeled next week for that official announcement...</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/hollow-knight-silksong-launch-19-99/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/hollow-knight-silksong-will-launch-at-19-99.1285449/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Adelaide-based independent developer Team Cherry has now <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:njcr3moahtid7crxdjtu26jp/post/3lxqi3epy3s2p?ref_src=embed" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed</a> the launch pricing of Hollow Knight: Silksong: $19.99/€19.99/¥2300. The studio also shared the unlock time with the fans, confirming that the game will be playable starting Thursday, August 4, at 7 AM Pacific Time | 10 AM Eastern Time | 4 PM Central European Time | 11 PM Japan Time.</p>



<p>It must feel almost unreal to Hollow Knight aficionados. It's been eight and a half years since the first game won widespread critical acclaim and became so popular that it has sold over 15 million units over time. Silksong was announced just two years later and was already playable at E3 2019. Still, for a long while, there were no updates from the team, who would later say they preferred to focus all energies on the development instead of communication. </p>



<p>Originally conceived as a DLC for the first installment, Hollow Knight: Silksong has since become much bigger than its predecessor, boasting more enemies, bosses, and 'benches'. It also features a full-fledged quest system and a journal to track those quests. In the narrative, Hornet, the former princess of Hallownest (the region featured in the first game), is captured and brought to the haunted Kingdom of Pharloom, described as a place "haunted by silk and song." She then embarks on a deadly pilgrimage to ascend its peak and discovers ancient secrets tied to her very nature and past.</p>



<p>The game's release date announcement forced several indie games (CloverPit, Aeterna Lucis, Baby Steps, Demonschool, Faeland, Little Witch in the Woods, and the demo of Stomp and the Sword of Miracles) to <a href="https://wccftech.com/hollow-knight-silksong-release-date-delays-indie-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">delay their own launches</a>, as they feared being overshadowed by the long-anticipated sequel. As a reminder, Hollow Knight: Silksong is being released on PC (Windows, macOS, Linux), PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series S|X, Nintendo Switch, and Nintendo Switch 2.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/how-to/hell-is-us-guide-5-things-to-know-before-starting/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Hell is Us is the latest game from Montreal-based studio, Rogue Factor, which has greatly emphasized that this is a game not looking to hold your hand. There are no map markers, no quest trackers, none of the usual open-world comforts modern video game players enjoy.</p>



<p>The game will even remind you of this before it starts, to try and make it land that you're meant to find your way through the game by using your instincts, and paying close attention to your environment. After reviewing it for Wccftech, I can say that Hell is Us does a great job at making that experience feel fun and smooth. I can also say there are a few bits of knowledge that would've been nice to have going into the journey.</p>



<p>That's why this guide will break down the five most important things you'll want to know to be ready to jump into Hell is Us, that also don't ruin the mystery and fun of discovery that's so core to the experience.</p>



<h2 id="h-5-things-to-know-before-starting-hell-is-us-guide">5 Things to Know Before Starting Hell is Us Guide</h2>



<h3 id="h-1-have-a-notebook-and-a-pen-at-the-ready">1. Have a notebook and a pen at the ready</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Sometimes it's just easier to write details like this down instead of running back and forth if you can't remember them.</figcaption></figure>



<p>You don't need to be writing everything you see and do down, this isn't Blue Prince. But it is helpful to have a notebook beside you with a pen ready to jot down potential clues you come across and parts of a puzzle solution as you try to solve the several puzzles you'll face in Hell is Us. The puzzle gameplay is arguably more important to the game than the combat, and unless you have an incredible memory, or swap back and forth between your game and screenshots you take, you'll need a notebook by your side.</p>



<h3 id="h-2-you-can-t-always-solve-the-puzzle-in-front-of-you-the-first-time-you-see-it">2. You can't always solve the puzzle in front of you the first time you see it</h3>



<figure><figcaption>You won't be able to get into every building and solve every puzzle when you first find them.</figcaption></figure>



<p>There will be a few puzzles you come across, one even in the very first area of the game, that you can't solve the first time you see them. You'll need an item or some piece of knowledge that you'll acquire later on in the game, so the only thing to do is to move on and come back to it later.</p>



<p>With Hell is Us lacking any map or quest trackers, it's tough at times to know what will help you progress the main story, what's optional, and what you need to be doing next. All of that packed together means it's easy to spend far too long smashing your head against something you literally cannot solve the first or sometimes even the second time you come across it. Again, another reason why it's good to have a notebook with you, so you can make a note remembering to go back when you have the item or knowledge you're missing.</p>



<h3 id="h-3-spec-into-crowd-control">3. Spec into crowd-control</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Combat encounters are often 3-or-more-against-1. Image credit: Rogue Factor</figcaption></figure>



<p>You have a few different weapon varieties you can choose from, and between those varieties, you can tweak them by infusing abilities based on four core emotions that are central to the game's story. It all comes down to what you prefer to use, because I found that there are things to appreciate with weapon variants for each emotion. But succeeding in the combat is less about the specifics of your gear, and more about how the weapons and abilities you select let you control the flow of combat.</p>



<p>Hell is Us doesn't feature a lot of boss fights; more accurately, it features several combat encounters with a few or sometimes large quantities of enemies that are designed to try and catch you off-balance. That's why whatever weapon you choose, whatever emotional variant you infuse it with, you'll want abilities and a weapon that can help you even out the odds.</p>



<p>A larger weapon, like a greatsword or the halbred-esque polearm are helpful physical tools for crowd control, but area-of-effect abilities that can be added to any of your weapons are going to be more important in helping you keep the advantage in a fight. So even if you go with the shorter-ranged twin axes, as I did for a good chunk of my playthrough, having abilities that stunned and damaged enemies within a certain area of impact helped even out the fact that I could only really focus my blows at one creature at a time, instead of taking wide sweeping attacks against a group.</p>



<h3 id="h-4-talk-to-everyone">4. Talk to everyone</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Details on where to go and what to do next will commonly come up in conversations you have.</figcaption></figure>



<p>This one should be a little more obvious due to how puzzle solving works in Hell is Us, but it needs to be said: talk to every NPC you see. If you can ask them questions, ask them as many questions as you can. Even the six general knowledge topics you'll see appear with every NPC you can have a direct conversation with.</p>



<p>Most of the time, answers pertaining to your investigation and the puzzle you're trying to solve will come through the unique questions you can ask for each NPC. But there are answers to be found when asking the general knowledge questions.</p>



<p>Even beyond just asking to try and help solve a gameplay-related issue you have, it's worth talking to them because Rogue Factor has done a wonderful job in making everyone you meet feel like a real person. Half of the enjoyment there is in Hell is Us comes from the strength of its supporting cast. Spend as much time with them as you can.</p>



<p>Also, you'll have objects you can 'Trade' with NPCs, which is to say there are things you'll find in the world that, if you listen carefully, are items you can deliver to NPCs who have indirectly asked for them. If you're not sure if you've matched the right object to the person, there's no harm in asking, since the wrong person will just tell you they don't need the object or whatever it is you're offering.</p>



<h3 id="h-5-keep-your-head-on-a-swivel">5. Keep your head on a swivel</h3>



<figure><figcaption>You'll always want to be looking at what's on the walls.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Hell is Us is not an open-world game. There are several places you'll go to in the game's setting throughout the story, and each is a contained zone that you can explore to the extent of its boundaries.</p>



<p>Because there's no active map for you to rely on, nothing that will tell you in real-time where you've gone and where you're going, you'll need to learn how to get around each zone. Sure, you can make notes and jot directions for yourself, but it's worth keeping in mind that each zone has been designed with the intention that you should be able to find your way naturally.</p>



<p>On top of paying attention to everything people tell you and making notes of the clues you'll read or pick up, looking at the details of your environment is vital to figuring out where to go next and how to solve the puzzles you'll come across. Keep your head on a swivel and don't stop looking around until you're sure you have all the information you need as you move from room to room and place to place within each zone. Since they're all contained, you don't have to worry as much about getting lost and winding up somewhere too far from where you want to be, like how taking the wrong path in an open-world game can mean an hour of backtracking if you're not paying attention.</p>

This action-adventure offering from Rogue Factor combines sci-fi elements and a bit of dark fantasy horror on the side.

You might be curious as to why there's a huge gap in the estimates. Well, that's because you can tweak the game's difficulty while you're playing. These include lowering the health, base damage, and aggressiveness of enemies.
