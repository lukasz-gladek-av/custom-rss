            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dungeonborne-playtest-early-access<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Gritty fantasy extraction RPG&nbsp;<em>Dungeonborne&nbsp;</em>has revealed that it's holding one final playtest before its Early Access release, although we still don't know exactly when the game is arriving.</p>
<p>If you head over to the game's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2448970/Dungeonborne/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam page</a> right now, you'll be greeted with the chance to request access to the game's newest playtest, which developer Mithril Interactive says will contain several improvements and updates "based on community feedback".</p>
<p>These improvements include balance changes for&nbsp;<em>Dungeonborne</em>'s various classes, as well as overhauls for three weapon sets and a new weapon to try out.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dungeonborne-playtest-gothic-city.jpg?itok=ldWzYHNF 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dungeonborne-playtest-gothic-city.jpg?itok=6bu7H6TK 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Dungeonborne&nbsp;</em>will have some new tricks up its sleeve for its newest playtest.</figcaption></figure><p>Specifically, Mithril Interactive says&nbsp;<em>Dungeonborne</em>'s Pyromancer, Priest, Death Knight, and Fighter have been "balanced, changed, or entirely reworked", and a new class, Druid, is also set to make its debut in the new playtest.</p>
<p>The Sword and Shield, Dual Swords, and Fire Staff weapon sets have all been "rebuilt from the ground up", boasting new animations, mechanics, and moves.</p>
<p>Additionally, the Orb, a new weapon that can be paired with the Sword or the Mace, has been introduced, adding an icy twist to your melee combat.</p>
<p>All of these features are available in the new&nbsp;<em>Dungeonborne&nbsp;</em>playtest, so if you want to head in and try out the extraction RPG's newest tweaks, all you've got to do is click "Request access" on the game's Steam page.</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Dungeonborne</em>, it's a PvPvE extraction RPG in a similar vein to the likes of&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/dark-and-darker"><em>Dark and Darker</em></a>, although this one hopefully won't be at the center of a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dark-and-darker-appears-on-epic-games-store-in-spite-of-legal-battle-against-nexon">similar legal battle</a>.</p>
<p>The game tasks players with delving into dungeons in search of treasure before deciding whether to extract early to secure their loot or to delve deeper and risk it all for more.</p>
<p>We still don't have a concrete release date for&nbsp;<em>Dungeonborne&nbsp;</em>yet, but you can request access to the game's latest (and final) closed playtest right now. Stay tuned for more.</p>

The last major cross-gen exclusive Sony released was<em> God Of War Ragnarök </em>at the end of 2022. The following year’s<em> Spider-Man 2</em> launched without a PS4 version. <em>Burning Shores</em>, 2023's expansion for the cross-gen <em>Horizon Forbidden West</em>, was also a “next-gen” exclusive. “PlayStation 4 Generation Is Well And Truly Over!” <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/Zuby_Tech/status/1686106539457716224&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/Zuby_Tech/status/1686106539457716224" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">one viral tweet</a></span> from last summer read. “Crossgen Is Over!”</p><p>Despite hinting that development <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-expects-to-be-done-with-ps4-games-by-2025&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-expects-to-be-done-with-ps4-games-by-2025" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">would be phased out by 2025</a></span>, Sony has never officially confirmed that it’s done making games for the PS4. It’s last word on the subject came from recently minted PlayStation co-CEO Hermen Hulst in 2022.  “We certainly don’t want to forget the millions of active players on PS4, and we want to ensure there are great games for them as well,” the then-head of PlayStation Studios <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.axios.com/2022/10/04/playstation-hermen-hulst-pc-mobile-interview&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.axios.com/2022/10/04/playstation-hermen-hulst-pc-mobile-interview" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">told <em>Axios</em></a></span><em> </em>at the time. “We’re evaluating it on a case-by-case basis.”</p><p>There was reason to think one or two first-party projects might still squeak out onto the older hardware. In addition to being on Nintendo Switch due to licensing demands, <em>MLB The Show 24</em> also still came to PS4 and Xbox One. Then Sony revealed <em>Horizon Lego Adventures </em>at Summer Game Fest, a kid-friendly co-op game seemingly aimed at broadening the sci-fi series appeal. </p><p>To that end the it’s coming to Switch in addition to PS5 when it launches later this year, but weirdly not PS4. That feels like an intentional business decision rather than a technical necessity. The older system can clearly handle the benchmarks set by Nintendo’s aging handheld hybrid and is no doubt active in millions of households with children that still haven’t upgraded to PS5, and perhaps still won’t since this year’s <em>Call of Duty</em>, <em>Madden</em>, and <em>EA FC Sports</em> (formerly known as <em>FIFA</em>) will all be available on the last generation machines.</p><p>But 2024 has been full of of PlayStation console exclusives and almost all of them have skipped the PS4. Earlier this year those included <em>Final Fantasy VII: Rebirth</em>, <em>Helldivers 2</em>, <em>Stellar Blade</em>, and <em>Rise of the Rōnin</em>, the latter three of which were published by Sony. <em>Granblue Fantasy: Relink </em>was the lone exception, probably because its development was originally announced back in 2016. </p><p>More recently, Sony revealed its upcoming live service hero shooter <em>Concord</em> will be a PS5 console exclusive too. It may have been technically unfeasible to bring the <em>Overwatch 2</em> competitor to a weaker system, but there certainly would have been an interest in aiming it at as big an audience of potential PS Plus subscribers as possible.<em> Astro Bot </em>skipping PS4 also doesn’t feel like it would have been a forgone conclusion given the more Nintendo-like scope of the project, though it’s easier to understand once you see how integrated the PS5 DualSense is <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/astro-bot-ps5-hands-on-impressions-playstation-1851535387&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/astro-bot-ps5-hands-on-impressions-playstation-1851535387">into the fabric of what makes the game fun and compelling</a></span>. </p><p>While unfortunate for PS4 owners, it wouldn’t be surprising if Sony has indeed quietly decided to turn the page on one of the best console-generations of all-time. If anything, it’s more shocking that the cross-gen party has lasted as long as it has. We’re already in the second half of the PS5's lifecycle and platforms have traditionally ditched development on older console generations much sooner in an effort to get more people to upgrade sooner. Covid clearly disrupted the “normal” transition periods for the PS5 and Xbox Series X/S. And maybe ballooning first-party budgets did too. <em>God Of War Ragnarök </em>wouldn’t have set a sales record if it had been on new hardware alone.</p><p>It’s unclear if Horizon Lego Adventures and Astro Bot are evidence that Sony’s going to start rebuilding the smaller, less expensive part of its first-party portfolio. Is so, maybe there’s still hope for one last first-party game on PS4. Somehow I doubt it. </p><p> Sony did not respond to a request for comment. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>With the launch of The First Descendant, its microtransaction system has garnered mixed reactions from players. The game has also been experiencing some issues and developer Nexon is providing some in-game compensation.</p><p>The First Descendant has been compared to other multiplayer games, such as Warframe, which is also free-to-play game. One user on Reddit compared the microtransaction system in both games and claimed that The First Descendant was "20 times more expensive than Warframe."</p><p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TheFirstDescendant/comments/1du7tcq/the_first_descendant_is_20_times_more_expensive/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Reddit user goompas</a> used the example of character mods, which help improve character stats, such as increasing the amount of damage they do or reduce the amount of damage taken from enemies. In Warframe, players can buy Orokin Reactor's to increase character mod capacity for 20 premium currency, which comes out to about $1.50. In The First Descendant, however, a similar item costs 1500 premium currency, which comes out to about $30. However, mods can still be earned through gameplay.</p><p>Other Descendants take time and resources to unlock, but they can be purchased immediately with premium currency. However, the issue here and with many of the microtransactions is that the bundles of premium currency don't line up with the cost of these new characters. Players are forced to purchase multiple currency bundles as they individually don't match up to the cost of characters, so players have leftover premium currency. There are also Ultimate Descendants, which are more powerful versions, and they require rarer materials to unlock. They cost even more premium currency to unlock right away, which has faced backlash by players.</p><p>Nexon is also offering in-game compensation for launch day issues in the form of a three-day 30% gold gain, Kyper Shard gain, EXP gain, and weapon mastery EXP gain boosts, as well as two matte red paints.</p><p>The First Descendant is currently available for PC, PlayStation, and Xbox. It features <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/does-the-first-descendant-have-cross-play-and-cross-progression/1100-6524665/" data-ref-id="1100-6524665">cross-play and cross-progression</a>, letting players play with other players on different platforms, as well as carry over their progress no matter with platform they play on. Despite its issues, The First Descendant had a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-looter-shooter-the-first-descendant-is-off-to-a-big-start/1100-6524651/" data-ref-id="1100-6524651">strong debut</a> of over 200,000 concurrent Steam players during its launch day.</p>

            <p>We've had the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enshittification">enshittification</a> of Google, Facebook and the public internet at large, now for the enshittification of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/gta-online">GTA Online</a>. What do you mean, "it was enshittified to start with"? Take it to the comments please, because first I need to tell you about the latest GTA Online update, which allows you to collect cash from your businesses, request vehicles and replenish ammo using your in-game phone - but only if you pay up $8 or $7 a month for a GTA+ subscription, which is currently not available on PC.</p><!--more-->
<p>The update in question is the Bottom Dollar Bounties update, which adds a Vinewood Club app to your character's mobile, providing you're a GTA+ subscriber. As <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/grand-theft-auto/gta-online-just-locked-a-quality-of-life-feature-players-have-wanted-for-ages-behind-the-gta-paywall-and-fans-worry-it-sets-a-dangerous-precedent-for-gta-6/">Gamesradar</a> points out, putting what is being called a "basic quality-of-life feature" behind a paywall has caused something of a scrum on the reddits, and has led to dire predictions about the monetisation of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gta-6-everything-we-know">GTA 6</a>, to say nothing of much wailing and gnashing of teeth from poor PC players who are still waiting for Rockstar to add currently PS5/Xbox Series-exclusive features such as animals to GTA Online.</p>
<p>GTA Online players have been calling for the ability to gather business earnings without having to visit the property in question for yonks, which makes this a bit of a monkey's paw situation. As one <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gtaonline/comments/1do3ipa/gta_members_can_now_claim_business_earnings_from/">redditor</a> puts it: "So many players requested this feature, yeah they're "listening to our feedback" and figuring out how to monetize it. One of the slimiest things they've done in a while." I don't have a GTA Online business empire myself, but it certainly feels rather antiquated to have to show up yourself for every payout. This isn't Goodfellas - GTA Online is set in the 21st century. Still, nothing screams "21st century" like paywalling access to a banking app.</p>
<p>To say a little in Rockstar's defence, there's more to Bottom Dollar Bounties than fury about paywalls. There are the literal walls of the new Bail Enforcement Office, where you'll get to live the morally dubious life of a professional bounty hunter. Here's a rundown of the highlights, via press release:</p>
<blockquote><p>An all-new Bail Enforcement Office, offering lucrative opportunities to track down and haul Standard and more challenging Most Wanted Targets</p>
<p>Dispatch Work: Off-the-books activities in Freemode assisting officer Vincent Effenburger to take down LSPD's corrupt cops -- all conducted from the seat of a personal police interceptor</p>
<p>New Vehicles: The Imani Tech-eligible Enus Paragon S and Bollokan Envisage, the HSW-upgradable Übermacht Niobe and Annis Euros X32, the Invetero Coquette D1, Declasse Yosemite 1500, and a trio of new Law Enforcement Vehicles (Declasse Impaler SZ Cruiser, Bravado Greenwood Cruiser, and Bravado Dorado Cruiser)</p>
<p>Drift tuning available in three newly eligible vehicles -- the Vulcar Nebula Turbo (Sports Classic), Übermacht Cypher (Sports), and Übermacht Sentinel Widebody (Sports)</p>
<p>New Exclusive GTA+ Benefits: A new Vinewood Club phone app from which players can claim Business earnings, replenish ammo, and request vehicles; a new Vehicle Workshop in The Vinewood Club enabling Club members to mod their personal vehicles; the ability to claim the new Överflöd Pipistrello (Super) a week early for free, and more</p>
<p>Experience improvements:</p>
<p>New Career Progress rewards for Bail Enforcement</p>
<p>New Creator tools allowing players to construct their own Drift and Drag Races using new props</p>
<p>Increased base GTA$ payouts for many activities, including Open Wheel Races, Taxi Work, A Superyacht Life, Lowriders Missions, and many more</p></blockquote>
<p>As for GTA 6, it's tentatively down to launch in fall 2025. Here are <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gta-6-first-trailer-reactions">some things we want</a>, based on the trailer.</p>

<p>Several new reports have claimed that Activision games will start to come to Xbox Games Pass in August.</p>



<p>The first claim came courtesy of eXtas1s on the <a href="https://forums.exputer.com/threads/exclusive-new-details-regarding-activision-games-coming-to-xbox-game-pass-emerge.222/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">eXputer forums</a> (who has admittingly a rough track record), but WindowsCentral’s <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/report-crash-bandicoot-n-sane-trilogy-is-coming-to-xbox-game-pass-in-august" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">Jez Corden has corroborated the rumor</a>.</p>



<p>According to eXtas1s, the Tony Hawk 1+2 remake and the Spyro Reignited Triology will also be coming to the subscription service in the near future. Subsequently, in Corden’s report, he also outlines that he understands Microsoft’s strategy isn’t to release all of Actvision’s back catalog at once but rather drip feed it into the platform.</p>



<p>One question for me, though, and presumably for many people, is when old Call of Duty games will come into service. It’s something that fans have wanted since the acquisition was finalized and it at the very least would reignite arguably some of the best Call of Duty games ever to release.</p>



<p>But for now, at least, fans have the Crash Bandicoot N.Sane Trilogy to look forward to. The game was the best-selling game for eight consecutive weeks in the United Kingdom following its release and has been estimated to have sold 20 million units worldwide as of June 2024.</p>



<p>What do you think of old Activision titles finally making their way to Game Pass? Let us know in the comments below!</p>

<p>The First Descendent has been out for a few days, and it’s received a mixed overall reaction from players. One issue that has been real frustrating for some are frame rate drops within The First Descendent.</p>



<p>In a post <a href="https://tfd.nexon.com/en/news/2594639?headlineId=1015" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">on the studio’s website</a>, developer Nexon has acknowledged the frame rate issues, and gave players a pretty straightforward “fix” to the problem. According to Nexon, you should just delete the game…and then reinstall, of course.</p>



<p>They say most of the issues come from players who pre-downloaded the game ahead of its launch. </p>



<p>“We are currently investigating this issue,” Nexon said. “In the meantime, if you encounter this problem, please delete and reinstall the game as a temporary solution.”</p>



<p>In addition to the frame rate problems, Nexon has a full list of known issues that it is working on for the game. Due to the nature of how it launched, the studio even <a href="https://tfd.nexon.com/en/news/2596137" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">announced in-game compensation</a> for players in the form of boosts to Gold, Kyper Shards, experience, and more.</p>



<p>The First Descendent is available now for PlayStation 5, PS4, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, and PC.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-generative-ai-no-plans</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nintendo-has-no-plans-to-use-generative-ai-in-first-party-games.918153/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-generative-ai-no-plans<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nintendo president Shuntaro Furukawa has clarified the company's position on the use of generative AI, pointing out that the technology has IP rights issues and vowing to "deliver value that is unique to us".</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2024/qa2406.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Q&amp;A held recently with Nintendo investors</a>&nbsp;(via the folks at <a href="https://www.tweaktown.com/news/99109/nintendo-wont-use-generative-ai-in-its-first-party-games/index.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">TweakTown</a>), Furukawa was asked about his and Nintendo's stance on generative AI in gaming.</p>
<p>In response to the question, Furukawa said that while he recognizes the potential of generative AI to be "more creative" than regular gaming AI, he and Nintendo also acknowledge that it has "issues with intellectual property rights".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/tears-of-the-kingdom-nintendo-generative-ai.jpg?itok=kP_1sgnM 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/tears-of-the-kingdom-nintendo-generative-ai.jpg?itok=7j3l1kCU 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Don't expect to see generative AI in the next&nbsp;<em>Zelda&nbsp;</em>game.</figcaption></figure><p>Furukawa goes on to say that Nintendo has "decades of know-how" in creating games for its customers, and that it wants to "deliver value that is unique to [Nintendo]" which "cannot be achieved through technology alone".</p>
<p>It's important to note that Furukawa doesn't outright reject the possibility of Nintendo ever using generative AI; he says the company "remain[s] flexible in responding to technological developments".</p>
<p>However, it sounds like Nintendo is being rightly cautious about using generative AI in its games given the potential of AI to infringe copyright. He doesn't mention AI's <a href="https://direct.mit.edu/glep/article/24/2/9/120588/Generative-AI-and-Social-Media-May-Exacerbate-the" rel="noopener" target="_blank">potentially disastrous impact on the climate</a>, nor its tendency to <a href="https://mitsloanedtech.mit.edu/ai/basics/addressing-ai-hallucinations-and-bias/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">damagingly "hallucinate"</a>, but these are serious issues facing AI proponents as well.</p>
<p>Nintendo is just the latest company to address the use of generative AI in games, and it's worth noting that the Japanese giant is one of the more skeptical companies; others have been quicker to embrace what they see as AI's potential to improve their games.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/ubisoft-skull-and-bones-generative-ai.jpg?itok=OkZ5d3q7 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/ubisoft-skull-and-bones-generative-ai.jpg?itok=g1pAIeIr 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Ubisoft is one of the publishers that has hitched its wagon to AI.</figcaption></figure><p>Publishers that have embraced the use of generative AI in games include EA, which says <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ea-hopes-to-use-generative-ai-to-drive-more-monetization-and-make-development-30-more">development could become up to 30% more efficient</a> through AI usage, and Ubisoft, which is looking into the potential of generative AI for everything from NPC dialogue to internal processes.</p>
<p>The tech has also been <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xbox-partners-with-generative-ai-company-to-enable-dynamically-generated-stories-quests">embraced by Xbox</a>, as well as <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/video-by-nvidia-aims-to-prove-power-of-generative-ai-in-games-does-exactly-opposite">graphics card giant Nvidia</a>, although I'd argue that none of these companies have done a great job of demonstrating what's in it for us as players when it comes to AI.</p>
<p>Of course, there's always a chance that Nintendo will change its stance regarding AI in the future, although the gaming giant has never been particularly timely when it comes to trends. Stay tuned for more on all things AI in gaming.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/tiny-garden-looks-like-an-adorable-polly-pocket-full-of-sunshine-for-pc-and-switch<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>A fun-looking farming sim known as Tiny Garden has cropped up on Kickstarter. </p>
<p>Tiny Garden is described as a "tiny farming and easy-going strategy game inside a tiny toy from the 90s". While developer Ao Norte doesn't specify further, it is immediately apparent Tiny Garden's quaint toy-aesthetic has been inspired by Polly Pocket, with its clam shell opening, dolls house-like levels and - of course - its tiny garden.</p>
<p>Other video game inspirations, meanwhile, include the likes of Unpacking and Summerhouse.</p>

<p>"Plant, grow, and trade your vegetables for new plants and items to customise your toy set," the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2812450/Tiny_Garden/">game's Steam page reads</a>. "In Tiny Garden, everything revolves around the most humble plastic vegetables. Get some carrot or turnip seeds, make them grow, and trade them for bigger and fancier vegetables, plants, or even furniture items to customise every corner of your garden."</p>
<p>You can see Tiny Garden's Kickstarter trailer above.</p>
<p>Ao Norte promises a wholesome, stress-free game on Tiny Garden's debut, with no death or fail state. Just the pleasure of gardening with the added bonus of "charming items and wonderful secrets" to discover.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, Tiny Garden has raised £7368 of its £4234 Kickstarter goal, with 350 backers supporting the project. It actually reached its initial goal in just one hour, but if you are keen to also get involved, the <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/aonorte/tiny-garden-build-your-own-magical-garden-inside-a-90s-toy/description">Kickstarter</a> is running until 1st August.</p>
<p>Tiny Garden does not have a specific launch date as yet, although it is planned for a digital release across Nintendo Switch and PC. Well, trowel be! </p>

<p>If you’ve been waiting for EA’s Skate to get a skateboarding fix, there’s a game that’s been available for some time now that can scratch that itch, and it seems as though people have found it.

It was remade as Ys: The Oath in Felghana for PSP in 2005. The remake was ported to PC in 2012.</p><p>Oath in Felghana completely overhauled Ys III, and this new edition adds quality-of-life enhancements like Turbo mode, optional new character illustrations throughout the game, and voice acting for protagonist Adol Christin. For music fans, this version features three different iterations of the original soundtrack, all remastered in high-quality audio.</p><p>Ys Memoire: The Oath in Felghana follows the adventurous hero Adol and his companion Dogi as they return to Felghana after an eight-year journey. The lands are now filled with deadly monsters and a greedy overlord rules over the suffering residents. While Dogi leaves to seeks help from his former master, Adol stays on to assist the locals and quickly finds himself caught in the middle of new conspiracies and ancient legacies.</p><div data-embed-type="pinbox" data-ref-id="4304">  <ul>                              <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/lord-of-the-rings-4k-blu-ray-box-set-amazon-preorder/1100-6524366/">Lord Of The Rings 4K Blu-Ray Steelbook Collection Is Back In Print, Preorders Live At Amazon</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/official-xbox-controllers-get-significant-discounts-at-amazon-and-walmart/1100-6524341/">Official Xbox Controllers Get Significant Discounts At Amazon And Walmart</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/zelda-links-awakening-is-back-in-stock-for-40-at-amazon/1100-6511630/">Get Ready For Zelda: Echoes Of Wisdom With This Great Link's Awakening Deal</a></li>                          <li>         <span>+ Show More Best Gaming &amp; Tech Deals This Week Links (2)</span>       </li>          <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/save-big-on-nintendo-switch-joy-con-controllers-at-amazon-and-walmart/1100-6523566/">Save Big On Nintendo Switch Joy-Con Controllers At Amazon And Walmart</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/inside-out-2-fans-should-check-out-the-new-lego-mood-cube-set/1100-6524400/">Inside Out 2 Fans Should Check Out The New Lego Mood Cube Set</a></li>   </ul> </div>

			<p>The PlayStation 5 lead system architect Mark Cerny is surprised by the wide adoption of ray tracing, which he expected to see more in the latter parts of the current console generation, and the push for 60 frames per second, which has sort of become a universal rule.</p>
<p>Speaking with <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/mark-cerny-at-60-i-the-gi-interview">GamesIndustry</a> last month, the man mostly responsible for the Playstation 4 and the PlayStation 5 discussed his long career, the present, and possibly the future of gaming. Asked about what has surprised him the most in the current console generation, Mark Cerny revealed that he has been surprised by the wide adoption of ray tracing. Adding ray tracing capabilities to the current generation console was a late decision, and he thought that the technology would be used in games released late in the generation. On the contrary, several launch titles supported ray tracing, which made him happy.</p>
<p>The PlayStation 5 lead system architect was also surprised by the current generation's push for 60 frames per second, which was unexpected based on previous console generations.</p>
<p><em>"The other thing that has been surprising is the push to 60 frames per second. Based on previous console lifecycles, I would have expected there to be a lot more games that are 30 frames per second only, just because the artwork can be so much more detailed if you have longer time to render it. Instead, the almost universal rule this time around has been the games run at 60."</em></p>
<p>During the same interview, the PlayStation 5 lead system architect also commented on the impact Sony's consoles have had on the larger industry, such as putting pressure on the PC world with the PS5's SSD and on the Playstation to PC ports, which have been proven to be simpler than many thought. To compensate for games taking advantage of bespoke console features not available on PC, the minimum requirements for CPU and RAM were increased to compensate, and so far, it is undeniable Sony has done a very good job, barring a few disappointing ports that took some months to fix.</p>
<p><em>"There’s a recent development here, which is console exclusives that were created to run on bespoke PlayStation systems are now making their way to PC. That conversion has been simpler than many thought. The main consequence is that the minimum spec for the PC version of the game gets a bit higher, perhaps more CPUs or more RAM, in order to replace the missing systems."</em></p>
<p>Having led the development of the PlayStation 5, Mark Cerny undoubtedly led the creation of the upcoming Pro model. While the new hardware has yet to be officially announced, we already know, thanks to leaks, that it will come with some new features like the <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-45-faster-base-ps5/">PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution upscaler</a> and better ray tracing performance that will likely impact the industry as a whole as much as some of the base model's features did.</p>

For fighting game developers, the inclusion or exclusion of fan-favorite characters is a frequent topic of discussion, more so with each subsequent game. When asked about why he “hated” Anna Williams, a long-time veteran character of the series who has been featured in every mainline <em>Tekken </em>until <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/tekken-8-story-mode-dark-awakens-worth-it-1851209242&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/tekken-8-story-mode-dark-awakens-worth-it-1851209242"><em>Tekken 8</em></a></span>, it led to a series of tweets in which Harada, frankly, cooked people for weighing in with suggestions lacking insight into the intricacies of making a fighting game.<br></p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="194842" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Week In Games: System Shock, Street Fighter 6, And More" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="183" data-playlist="194842,196165,196215" data-current="194842"><div><p>The Week In Games: System Shock, Street Fighter 6, And More</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/194842/194842_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/194842/194842_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/194842/194842_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/194842/194842_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/20305.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>It started with a fan asking Harada why Anna, who has had a rivalry with her sister Nina throughout the<em> Tekken </em>series, is always treated as “inferior” to her. They go on to say it feels “like pulling teeth” to get her in a game, despite her perceived popularity compared to other characters across the franchise. Harada <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/Harada_TEKKEN/status/1808319287943483681&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/Harada_TEKKEN/status/1808319287943483681" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">started by saying</a></span> that he views all of Tekken’s characters like his own “children” and that any belief that he hates any of the fighters is people “just seeing something distorted by [their] assumptions.” The developer also pointed out that if every veteran character fans wanted was featured in each <em>Tekken</em> game, there would be “no room to introduce new ones.” While some games like <em>Super Smash Bros. Ultimate</em> have taken on the gargantuan task of releasing a game with every previous fighter, Harada says having a <em>Tekken</em> game with “50-70 characters” from the start is “unrealistic in every respect.”</p><p>“It should also be understood that all needs have opposing sides,” Harada wrote. “On top of that, I’ll say it again...your love for the characters is distorting the way you look at things, and it’s so absurd that you unilaterally think negatively about my point of view because of it.”</p><p>Things escalated further when someone else interjected that it would make sense “from a business standpoint” to stop introducing new fighters with each incremental release to “avoid this conundrum [he brings upon himself].” Harada <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/Harada_TEKKEN/status/1808326188995375348&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/Harada_TEKKEN/status/1808326188995375348" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">didn’t seem thrilled by that suggestion</a></span>, but also seemed tired of explaining the business realities of making video games. Not for free, anyway.</p><p>“Do you need me to explain that to you from every perspective now,” Harada asked. “Then from here on out, I’m going to charge you tuition for lectures on ‘what video games are,’ ‘what game development is,’ ‘what the game market is,’ ‘what the game business is,’ and so on. Also, before we talk about your business perspective, please tell me your business track record.”</p><p>I’d attend that class, to be honest. Harada’s willingness to engage with the <em>Tekken </em>community, despite the annoying shit he sometimes has to deal with, is commendable. It has resulted in some fun and heartwarming stories like fans <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/tekken-waffle-house-stage-1851378866&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/tekken-waffle-house-stage-1851378866">asking for a Waffle House stage</a></span>, and when he helped a player <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/tekken-8-ai-ghost-katsuhiro-harada-kohei-ikeda-lee-1851282635&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/tekken-8-ai-ghost-katsuhiro-harada-kohei-ikeda-lee-1851282635">salvage ghost data</a></span> to remember a lost loved one. <em>Tekken 8 </em>is doing pretty well for itself, though there has been some controversy surrounding <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/tekken-8-steam-rating-battle-pass-microtransaction-1851400527&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/tekken-8-steam-rating-battle-pass-microtransaction-1851400527">its inclusion of a battle pass</a></span>.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

In their post, the writer says that the side-quest, “should likely be locked to not be available until the completion of ‘Dawn of a New Tomorrow.” Until an official change is implemented, Warriors of Light will continue to warn each other about “Once a Riddler, Now a Ruler,” to keep the joy of discovery alive in <em>Dawntrail</em>.</p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>In <a href="https://x.com/DeadbyDaylight/status/1808502613630955567" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a new post</a> on X today, the Dead by Daylight team confirmed all of the content coming in July 2024 with an official roadmap.</p>



<p>The devs teased a livestream for the anticipated 2v8 game mode for July 16, ahead of the mode’s release on July 25. </p>



<p>Week 2 will also feature another archive with “Mythic”, as well as the previously announced <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/lara-croft-is-coming-to-dead-by-daylight-july-16-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Lara Croft survivor</a>. Croft will come with the Finesse, Hardened, and Specialist perks, which emphasize athletic and survival skills.</p>



<p>Week 3 will include both the 2v8 game mode and a Blood and Bones collection on July 25. Finally, week 4 will close things out with a “Forgotten Memory” collection on July 30. </p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Many fans are already calling for 2v8 to become a permanent mode in Dead by Daylight, following its July debut.</p>



<p>Although the game frequently has popular IP collaborations, it also continues to regularly update and evolve. The new 2v8 mode will greatly increase the scope of a match, and likely invite some surprising new combinations.</p>



<p>In May 2024, fans also got their <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/heres-a-first-look-at-dead-by-daylight-universe-game-project-t/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">first look at Project T</a>, a new game set in the Dead by Daylight universe.</p>



<p>Last month, Dead by Daylight developer Behaviour Interactive <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dead-by-daylight-dev-layoffs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced new layoffs</a>, affecting nearly 100 employees. The studio stated that this is part of “multiple strategic changes to its corporate structure. Fortunately, Dead by Daylight still features many healthy updates and fixes.</p>
