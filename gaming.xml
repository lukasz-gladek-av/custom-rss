<p>Manufacturers are working on updates to their docks</p>

<figure data-uuid="63d4585372042"><a title="Nintendo Switch 2 with S3 MAX TV Dock Station by Antank" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/63d4585372042/nintendo-switch-2-with-s3-max-tv-dock-station-by-antank.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Gavin Lane / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Following reports that some Switch 2 owners are having issues with third-party docks, Nintendo has addressed the issue.</p>
<p>In a response to <a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/video-games/nintendo/nintendo-says-it-has-no-intention-of-blocking-third-party-switch-2-docks-following-firmware-update-that-stopped-them-from-working-accessory-makers-scramble-to-deploy-workaround">Tom's Hardware</a> and <a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-just-blocked-third-party-switch-2-docks-and-it-sucks-2000644081">Kotaku</a>, a representative told the outlets that "Nintendo does not have any intention to hinder or invalidate legal third-party dock compatibility."</p>
<p>The issue of third-party compatibility <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Switch/comments/1ou7lo8/psa_switch_2_v2100_disables_third_party_docks/?utm_source=embedv2&amp;utm_medium=post_embed&amp;utm_content=post_body&amp;embed_host_url=https://www.tomshardware.com/video-games/nintendo/nintendo-says-it-has-no-intention-of-blocking-third-party-switch-2-docks-following-firmware-update-that-stopped-them-from-working-accessory-makers-scramble-to-deploy-workaround">cropped up earlier this week</a> after the Nintendo Switch 2 Version 21.0.0 update dropped. Many who have updated their consoles to the latest version have found that their third-party docks are no longer working with the console.</p>
<p>Some have even said that the official Switch 2 dock also stopped working after the update, but a quick restart has fixed this.</p>
<p>While not all third-party docks are affected, and some manufacturers have managed to put out hotfixes, it seems like the issues caused by the latest update are completely unintentional. Still, some manufacturers are suggesting Switch 2 owners to hold off on updating their console <em>until</em> they've managed to get a fix going.</p>

<p>"Nintendo Switch 2 outputs audiovisuals once it detects that it is docked into a Nintendo Switch 2 Dock," the representative explained, reiterating that the original Switch works similarly.</p>
<p>The Switch 2 dock situation has been a little tenuous in the early months of the console's life. Reports from July this year suggest that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/switch-2-usb-c-chip-might-be-breaking-compatibility-with-third-party-docks">the USB-C chip may be responsible</a> for some other compatibility issues. These issues are unrelated to the latest update.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>There’s been a very different tone to the games news this week, with the juggernaut of Call of Duty feeling like it’s lost a step in the face of some serious competition. Battlefield 6 is out there doing a straight up war shooter, Arc Raiders has made an extraction shooter love-in, and now here’s Black Ops 7, where there’s just a baffling direction for the campaign.</p>
<p>It takes some of the psychological mish-mash of Black Ops 3’s story, which people hated back in the day, the open world missions of Modern Warfare III, which people hated a couple years ago, practically makes co-op mandatory, and then has an Endgame post-campaign thing that will have to compete for attention with both the main Zombies mode and Dead Ops Arcade. It’s barmy, especially compared to the strengths of last year’s game.</p>
<p>The multiplayer does feel pretty good, though, which is the bulk of what people will play.</p>

<p><strong>Aran</strong> chimed in first, having played Forestrike and Umami for review. You’ll have to wait for the latter, but barring some snags, he enjoyed the puzzle-like take on the martial arts brawler in Forestrike.</p>

<p>As we continue through the busy season, <strong>Jim’s</strong> had to put Battlefield 6 on the back burner. He picked up a copy of Metal Gear Solid Delta in time for the Fox Hunt multiplayer, which is “a surprisingly competent online shooter”, and I dragged him into the Black Ops 7 single player with me, but in the main he’s “swapped body armour and boot laces for a fresh white toga for Anno 117: Pax Romana – it’s a series I’ve always been interested in playing but never got around to biting the bullet. Thoroughly enjoying my time as a governor in Ancient Rome, crafting city districts that not only perform well but look fab.”</p>

<p>Another conscript for Black Ops 7 was <strong>Miguel</strong>, who was about as baffled by some of the design choices as I was. Much clearer was playing some time with Tekken 8 and having fun with the King vs. Armour King matches. He’s also played the Atelier Ryza Deluxe trilogy pack, and went delved into his “niche weird Japanese action game” catalogue for D3 Publisher’s 2020 anime-girl-zombie-fighting action game OneeChanbara Origin. Sounds about right!</p>
<p><strong>Laura</strong> has continued to juggle Jurassic World Evolution 3 and Silent Hill 2 remake, getting some tonal whiplash from creepy nurses trying to kill her and being a proud park-building surrogate mum when the Megalodons brought a baby Megalodon into the world. Bless ’em!</p>
<p>Another genre juggler was <strong>Steve</strong>, going between the new SpongeBob SquarePants game and the classic horror of Tormented Souls 2, “which has been delayed somewhat after some bad ammo management put me in an impossible situation – what’s known in the trade as ‘Code Veronica-ing yourself’.” He’s also been a bit disappointed by the Sacred 2 Remaster.</p>

<p><strong>Ade</strong> has had the “fifty-something runs” which sound nasty until you realise he’s talking about Hades 2, where he reckons he’s nearing the end credits and would like to recommend it very highly.</p>
<p>And finally, <strong>Tuffcub</strong> played more Arc Raiders, “which is a lovely cuddly hug that reminds that despite how rubbish the world is, there are decent people in it.”</p>
<p>Now then, what have you played?</p>

              <p><i><span>Concord</span></i><span>’s shutdown was one of the highest-profile failures in not just video games, </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/concord-sony-biggest-flop-failure-box-office-1851676475"><span>but all of entertainment last year</span></a><span>. Sony </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/concord-shutting-down-closing-servers-refunds-ps5-1851638566"><span>pulled the plug</span></a><span> on its </span><i><span>Guardians of the Galaxy</span></i><span>-esque hero shooter days after its PS5 and PC launch failed to bring in players, and then subsequently </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/concord-firewalk-studios-relaunch-ps5-sony-playstation-1851652811"><span>shut down its developer, Firewalk Studios</span></a><span>. It was a highly publicized mess of mismanagement and callous corporate calculus, and it was also a damn shame because the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/concord-ps5-toxic-haters-heroes-shutdown-1851646309"><span>game was actually pretty alright</span></a><span>. Although the game seemed lost to time, some fans have taken it upon themselves to try and bring it back with fan-made servers, so if you wanted to see what all the fuss was about, you may have the chance.</span></p> <p><span>A group of fan modders has been working to rebuild </span><i><span>Concord</span></i><span>’s backend and create new servers (thanks, </span><a href="https://thegamepost.com/sony-concord-playable-again-custom-servers/"><i><span>TheGamePost</span></i></a><span>), and have officially played a match of the game once thought lost to time.&nbsp;</span></p>  <p><span>Red, one of the modders leading the project alongside Real, open_wizard, and Gwog, posted an update on Discord letting folks know the group had managed to play a match, though there are still a lot of bugs to iron out before they’re ready to open it up to more players.</span></p> <blockquote><p><span>After a long time of reverse engineering &amp; server development, we just managed to play a match of </span><i><span>Concord</span></i><span>! This is the match I played with open_wizard (don’t mind my horrible aim, I spend so much time reverse engineering that I no longer have the time to actually play games)</span></p> <p><span>The project is still WIP, it’s playable, but buggy. Once our servers are fully set up, we’ll begin doing some private playtesting, if anyone here wants to join those playtests, let me know (include what region/time zone you are in for convenience).</span></p></blockquote> <p><span>I still consider </span><i><span>Concord</span></i><span>’s fate</span> <span>to be a consequence of Sony’s terrible fumbling of its ill-advised live service pivot, but it’s always a bad thing when games are wiped from existence by their owners. A lot of people worked hard on </span><i><span>Concord</span></i><span>, and it deserves the dignity of being playable, even if Sony isn’t supporting it. So shoutout to fans for picking up the torch.</span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Activision has been known to use generative AI in Call of Duty in the past, but now there are accusations of it being used in a new way within Call of Duty: Black Ops 7.</p>



<p>Many have taken to social media to show examples of what looks to be generative AI art in Black Ops 7 calling cards.</p>







<h2 id="h-what-is-possibly-ai-in-black-ops-7">What Is Possibly AI In Black Ops 7?</h2>



<p>First shared by <a href="https://x.com/Kumesicles/status/1988982194916999619" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Kume on Twitter</a>, the ones being called out specifically come from challenges like “Over Here Buddy”, “Peekaboo”, “Reeled In”, and more. The cards in question use Studio Ghibli art style, which has been easy to generate in most AI art programs. </p>



<p>The use of AI is disclosed on the game’s <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3606480/Call_of_Duty_Black_Ops_7/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Steam store page</a>. However, it doesn’t say what was done. Instead, it simply reads, “Our team uses generative AI tools to help develop some in game assets.” So, seeing things like calling cards be, possibly, the work of AI shouldn’t come as <a href="https://x.com/MikeStrawMedia/status/1865107470751834402" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">much of a surprise</a>. That said, it still might not sit well with players. </p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Insider Gaming has reached out to Activision for comment on the claims. As of publishing, no response has been received, but should one come, it will be added to this story.</p>



<p>If that doesn’t bother you, Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/visit/black-ops-7-loaded-xbox-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">is available now</a> for <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/visit/black-ops-7-amazon-us-ps5/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PlayStation 5</a>, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, and PC.  </p>

                <p>Epic Games is gearing up for its biggest shake-up to Fortnite Creative since the introduction of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/epic-announces-unreal-editor-for-fortnite-arriving-next-week/1100-6512398/" data-ref-id="1100-6512398">Unreal Editor for Fortnite</a>. Soon, Epic will allow developers who use UEFN to make Fortnite Creative modes, or "islands," to sell in-game items using V-Bucks, the game's real-money currency.</p><p dir="ltr">The news, which Epic announced during the Veteran's Day holiday in the US, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FortniteCreative/comments/1ouht3b/ive_got_a_feeling_this_could_ruin_fortnite/" rel="nofollow ">was not met with much excitement from fans</a>. The way the Fortnite Creative ecosystem is currently crammed with clones of tycoon, boxfight, and platforming islands, it's easy to see how adding microtransactions to any of the typical island types could be a bad thing. And it becomes much more difficult to see any possible upside when Epic's example idea is to <a href="https://www.fortnite.com/news/tools-for-in-island-transactions-now-available-to-fortnite-developers?lang=en-US" rel="nofollow ">sell people a better shovel for 300 V-Bucks</a>.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1757/17577455/4602590-fortnitecreativemicrotransactions.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4602590" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1757/17577455/4602590-fortnitecreativemicrotransactions.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4602590"></a><figcaption>Fortnite will allow UEFN developers to sell gameplay items for money soon.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1757/17577455/4602590-fortnitecreativemicrotransactions.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">But the reality is actually pretty murky, because V-Buck transactions are a wildcard that could completely shake up the Fortnite Creative ecosystem and encourage creators to try new things. We've got a digital Wild West here, in a sense. Let's try to understand the situation a little better, and get a better sense of where it may lead us, by taking a deep dive into the details.</p><h2 dir="ltr">What's actually happening with V-Bucks and Fortnite Creative</h2><p dir="ltr">Right now, creators can use UEFN to make islands that use the V-Buck mechanic, but they cannot publish these islands yet. The most important detail to understand here is that UEFN developers will not be able to sell any of the same types of things Epic sells--meaning purely cosmetic items are not allowed. That means no skins, no pickaxes, no kicks, and no original cosmetic types. Likewise, you can't sell XP gains, since Epic sells account levels in the shop. Random loot crates are allowed but will automatically be disabled in the many countries where that predatory practice is banned.</p><p dir="ltr">These restrictions mean, essentially, that anything sold in a Creative island must have a gameplay purpose. So in the current Creative ecosystem, the most obvious options are pay-to-win mechanics, like selling better-quality guns in a boxfight map, or some kind of bonus to your gains in a tycoon. Most of the available options are the kinds of things players generally dislike.</p><p dir="ltr">But since the current Creative ecosystem is currently geared entirely toward earning payouts from Epic through engagement and playtime, these V-Buck transactions probably aren't being added for the sake of most existing islands. Most current islands would drive people away if they started charging for things that used to be free, and those island creators will be able to keep earning those same playtime payouts in the same way they have been anyway. In other words, those maps can keep making money the same way they have been, so they may not want to bother with V-Buck shenanigans that could mess up their current streams of revenue.</p><p dir="ltr">Instead, adding V-Buck transactions to Creative is at least partially about encouraging UEFN developers to try new things. And it's also about capitalizing on Steal the Brainrot, specifically.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Steal the Brainrot and your V-Bucks</h2><p dir="ltr">Steal the Brainrot is the most popular Fortnite Creative island ever, with tens of thousands of players at any given moment and hundreds of thousands at peak times on the weekend. Steal the Brainrot is unique in that it's actually a licensed port of a popular Roblox game. It has no direct competition in Fortnite, because unlicensed copycat islands have faced legal action, and the Roblox version has a number of real-money transactions that are, thus far, absent from the Fortnite version.</p><p dir="ltr">Kids can use Robux to buy money, items, or Lucky Blocks that contain a random Brainrot--with the best Lucky Block going for $30. The mode also sells access to an "admin panel" that offers the ability to mess with your opponents for $50 or more, depending on the day's prices. We should expect these sort of predatory mobile-style, pay-to-win mechanics to be added to the Fortnite version once Epic allows creators to update their islands with the new microtransaction types.</p><p dir="ltr">It's not hard to figure, then, that Steal the Brainrot will be the first major beneficiary of these V-Buck transactions. But that doesn't mean you should expect to see that sort of thing everywhere in Fortnite.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Are Fortnite Creative and UEFN islands about to be filled with microtransactions?</h2><p dir="ltr">While Steal the Brainrot is a prime candidate for V-Buck transactions, that's not the case for most of the rest of the current Fortnite Creative ecosystem, which is largely built on folks ripping each other off. If one of 500 identical boxfight Pit maps tried selling better guns for V-Bucks, people would just switch to one that didn't do that. And it would be the same story with any of the other common Creative archetypes we currently have. You might see V-Buck donation boxes pop up, but you won't see many paywalls added to existing islands.</p><p dir="ltr">As it is now, there's a decent chance that Epic is adding V-Buck transactions to Fortnite Creative specifically to capitalize further on Steal the Brainrot, and there may not be much of an audience for them in the current ecosystem. But the ecosystem will change as a result of Epic offering this new way to monetize maps. You can expect a lot of creators to try the same old exploitative mobile game-style monetization tricks that we're all too familiar with by now, but there actually is some (hypothetical) good news in all this.</p><h2 dir="ltr">The possible upside to Fortnite Creative V-Buck transactions</h2><p dir="ltr">There certainly could be some decent outcomes from this. Right now, creators can only monetize based on their engagement stats, and that's led to a lot of trend-chasing as creators keep trying to make "better" versions of things that simply exist to waste your time rather than be particularly enjoyable. While plenty of predatory monetization could come with this, the upside is that it should encourage creators to try new types of games.</p><p dir="ltr">For example, this scheme would allow a developer to create an experience within a "paid area" and charge V-Bucks for permanent access--selling a video game within Fortnite, essentially. When devs have more ways to monetize, they're more likely to make more unique things.</p><p dir="ltr">But for now, all this is speculative. Aside from those Brainrots, we don't really know what kind of stuff will sell in this ecosystem. This is one of those situations where nobody, including Epic, really knows how it'll shake out, because it's going to be up to UEFN developers, and their players, to decide what works.</p>

You get to create a character, design a house, customize the furniture, and more as you interact with citizens and live out a cozy life in an open-world town. Not unlike The Sims, there's plenty to do: garden, fish, work, swim, raise children, discover personality traits, and more. Unfortunately, while it was planned to launch in early access on December 8, Massé <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1118520/view/627816662678110824" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">posted on the game's official Steam Store page</a> that Paralives' release has been delayed to May 25, 2026.</p>

<p>"We had to make the difficult decision to delay the release," Massé said. "We are truly sorry for the last-minute announcement. After thoughtful consideration, we feel it’s best for the game and the community. This year, we ran many playtests with friends and fans, and we were confident that we could improve the game enough in time for December. In the lead-up to Early Access release, we broadened our playtests with a more varied playerbase, and the latest feedback we received made us realise the game isn’t up to the standard we wanted it to meet for release. Players enjoy the flexibility and the customization of the Paramaker and Build Mode."</p><p>"However, there are still impactful bugs in the Live Mode and a lack of activities to do in the town," Massé continued. "Which dampened the enjoyment of the players, and we feel it is necessary to work on these before delivering the product to the community."</p><p>Massé <a href="https://paralives.notion.site/f138c4f6cb234604be16fe4198d17f51?v=41e2b3e389404b37b4060bc74dead4af" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">pointed to an updated roadmap</a> on the game's official website that focuses on the improvements the team will make over the coming months. Alongside addressing bugs and adding activities, these adjustments will include "fixing important issues and improving the first-time user experience" to ensure that players are happy with the state the game launches in.</p><p>"We are so proud of what we have built, but now, we just need a bit more time to polish the simulation part of the game," Massé continued. "This would ensure Paralives offers a great first experience when it launches, making players come back for every exciting free update and expansion that we will put out afterwards."</p><p>When Paralives launches in early access in May 2026, it'll get new features and add-on content that will be completely free of charge.</p>

                <p>If you're exploring <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/arc-raiders/" data-ref-id="5000-546105">Arc Raiders</a>' first post-launch map, Stella Montis, you may also be working on a quest called Cold Case. This quest asks you to head into Stella Montis to search for a J Kozma storage container to loot. This may sound like a tough thing to round up, but in reality, there's an extremely convenient way to get this quest knocked out and return to Speranza with minimal effort. Let's look into it.</p><p>Keep in mind that you need to extract with an item you'll receive by looting a J Kozma storage container, so bring in a loadout with a safe pocket just in case someone comes along and tries to ruin your run. As you'll see below, we'll be looting a container directly beside an extraction point, which reduces the chances that you'll encounter any trouble. But it's always better to be safe than sorry.</p><p>When you're ready to finish Cold Case, check below for where to find a J Kozma storage container.</p><h2>Where to find a J Kozma storage container for the Cold Case quest</h2><p>The J Kozma storage container can only be found on the Stella Montis map. While J Kozma storage containers can be found in various locations around the map, the easiest and most efficient to grab will likely be the one inside the Lobby Metro Station. This is because it's directly beside the button you'll need to hit to call in the train for extraction. You really can't get any more convenient.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4602586-19a835855e944-screenshoturl.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4602586" data-ratio="0.56325910931174" data-width="1976" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4602586-19a835855e944-screenshoturl.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4602586"></a><figcaption>Head to the Lobby Metro Station to find the J Kozma storage container.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4602586-19a835855e944-screenshoturl.jpg"></figure><p>Head down inside this POI to the extraction point. If you want to get out easily to finish the quest, go ahead and press the button to call the train, then turn 180 degrees to spot a container in front of the button. Walk forward and interact with the container to cause the Old World Books item to fall out. <strong>Make sure you pick up the Old World Books and add them to your inventory</strong>--preferably in a safe pocket just in case.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4602587-19a835855e942-screenshoturl.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4602587" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4602587-19a835855e942-screenshoturl.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4602587"></a><figcaption>Interact with the J Kozma storage container, then loot the Old World Books.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4602587-19a835855e942-screenshoturl.jpg"></figure><p>With the Old World Books obtained for Shani, you'll need to extract back to Speranza to complete the quest. Get in some cover until the train arrives and play it safe, as you never know when another raider could be in the area looking to score some easy loot from folks extracting. Once the train arrives, make a dash for the console inside and get back to Speranza.

<p>One thing that's quietly slipped by, however, is the reveal of a brand-new suit for our protagonist Samus Aran. As highlighted by <a href="https://x.com/NinWire/status/1989347451074171162">Nintendo Wire</a> in the below post, the suit can be seen in a short clip posted on the <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/jp/games/switch2/bgw5a/troopers/index.html">official Japanese website</a>.</p>
<p>Overall, it's got a similar vibe to Samus' new red suit, but there are also some clear similarities to the <a href="https://metroid.fandom.com/wiki/Light_Suit">Light Suit</a> seen in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/metroid_prime_2_echoes">Metroid Prime 2: Echoes</a>.</p><div><figure data-videoid="4gZSQE4poJM" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4gZSQE4poJM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="yt4gZSQE4poJM" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/4gZSQE4poJM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4gZSQE4poJM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed402431wnogvt&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>838k</span></a></p>

<p>What do you think? We wonder what kind of properties these new suits will take on. Will they grant new abilities? Only time will tell.</p>
<p>Previews have now gone live for Prime 4, including our own. It seems many folks aren't too keen on the new Galactic Federation Troopers accompanying Samus on her journey, but otherwise, this definitely looks and feels like a new Prime game. Heck yeah.</p>

            <p>Most of the attention on Rockstar post-<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/grand-theft-auto-vi">GTA 6</a>'s <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hi-everyone-gta-6-has-been-hit-with-delay-number-two">second delay</a> has, rightly, been focused on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/stop-this-from-happening-again-uk-politician-calls-out-rockstar-over-gta-6-developer-firings">their abrupt firing of 31 employees</a>, for which the IWGB have accused the company of union busting.</p>
<p>As all of that happens, though, the video game making machine continues to churn on, and GTA Online's continuing to get the additions Take-Two said it would when they set this latest delay in stone. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/grand-theft-auto-v">GTA 5</a>'s online element/cash cow guise has long been a playground where regular people like you or me can live out a still somewhat satire-tinged take on the fantasy lifestyles of uber-rich criminals, so it honestly feels a bit strange that it's taken this long for Rockstar to add in mansions.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>As outlined in the latest <a href="https://www.rockstargames.com/newswire/article/3921419k23a552/lay-a-proper-foundation-in-new-listings">Rockstar Newswire post</a>, those big houses are coming in an update this December. At this point, I'd ask that you briefly return your eyes to this article's strapline. There are almost certainly a few suitable living or at least sleeping places a GTA Online character can own at this point that I've left out of that list.</p>
<p>The game's economy, its prices for new additions hyperinflated to compensate for years of heist and business grinding from more dedicated players and the truckloads of real money spent by others, has long been an almost accidentally perfect parody of the real world.</p><p>Now, after years of living in cookie-cutter batchelor pads or tacky penthouses, its biggest whales are set to make the next step you would in real life. Buying a massive house to fill with monuments to your own glory, so you can live in the sort of cartoony decadence historically reserved for monarchs, major religious figures, robber barons, and investment bankers. No one in GTA Online needs a mansion. I'm fairly sure many who buy them will soon abandon setting foot in them, in favour of sleeping under the desk at a business or just not pretending to sleep at all. I remain unsure if this is just human nature or mastefully purposeful satire GTA Online players will play into.</p>
<p>If you jump into GTA Online this month, you can do three new missions for the folks who'll be selling the mansions. These new missions, dubbed "New Listings", involve clearing out squatters, finding construction materials, and motivating contractors. Doing all three will net you a discount of $2 million on your mansion. To put that in context, the <a href="https://www.gtabase.com/grand-theft-auto-v/properties/gta-online/the-orion-yacht">least swanky yacht</a> the game has to offer will cost you $6 million. Some <a href="https://www.gtabase.com/grand-theft-auto-v/properties/gta-online/darnell-bros-warehouse">business warehouses</a> go for more than $3 million. There's no indication of how much the mansions will cost yet, but I'm quite keen to find out, because I think I'll end up rolling on the floor laughing.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/since-rolling-out-this-black-friday-deal-on-blink-video-doorbell-52-off-amazon-sold-10k-units-2000644346</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/since-rolling-out-this-black-friday-deal-on-blink-video-doorbell-52-off-amazon-sold-10k-units.1354036/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Buying a video doorbell might not sound like the most exciting gift, but it’s one of those practical purchases that ends up being useful for home security. Amazon already <strong>dropped Black Friday prices on its own products</strong> ahead of the official sales rush which explains why Blink cameras and doorbells are sitting at record lows right now.</p>
<p>The latest <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4647/">Blink video doorbell just hit $28 instead of its usual $59 price tag</a>, which makes it an incredibly affordable way to monitor your front door. This doorbell delivers <strong>head-to-toe HD video, infrared night vision, and up to two years of battery life</strong> on three AA batteries.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4647/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>The Blink video doorbell operates off of<strong> three included AA Energizer lithium batteries for up to two years</strong>&nbsp;which means you aren’t climbing ladders every few months to swap out dead cells. Extended battery life comes in the form of efficient power management that will only activate recording after motion gets detected or someone pushes the doorbell button. You can <strong>install this unit completely wire-free</strong> with the included mounting kit in just minutes; no electrical knowledge is required. And if you prefer a wired setup, you can hook it into your existing doorbell wiring.</p>



<h2>HD Video and Night Vision</h2>
<p>It <strong>captures a full head-to-toe view of anyone at your door</strong>&nbsp;which makes a much bigger difference than one would think. Cheaper doorbells usually cut off at chest level and don’t show packages on the ground or clearly show faces. The expanded field of view lets you see where delivery drivers place boxes, identify visitors before opening the door, or monitor your entire doorstep area within one frame. <strong>HD video quality remains clear during the day, and infrared night vision automatically kicks in when the light starts to fall</strong>. You can actually make out faces and read package labels at night instead of just some blurry shapes moving around.</p>
<p>Two-way audio lets you communicate with whoever’s at your door through the Blink app on your phone: You hear them clearly, and they hear you respond in real time. That proves incredibly handy when you’re not home but need to give delivery instructions, tell a friend where the spare key is or let a visitor know you’ll be there in a few minutes.</p>



<p><strong>Amazon includes a free 30-day trial of the Blink Subscription Plan</strong>, which stores your video clips securely in the cloud and adds person detection. That way, you avoid most of the false alerts from cars, animals, or trees that may be moving in the wind, only to receive notifications if an actual human were to approach your door.</p>
<p>The <strong>doorbell supports Alexa-enabled devices</strong> so you can see who’s at your door from any of your Echo Show or Fire TV devices. You can ask Alexa to show your front door camera, arm or disarm your system, or get notifications on your smart speakers about activity at your door. This should come as no surprise as Amazon owns both Blink and Alexa, after all-and the two systems interact seamlessly with no need for elaborate setup routines.</p>
<p>At $28, this doorbell costs less than dinner for two while providing real security value for your home. The deal is live on Amazon right now, and considering how quickly these early Black Friday prices tend to sell out, grabbing one sooner rather than later probably makes sense.</p>

<p>Chief among these is the “blink” system, which lets you warp instantly from point to point in a way that reminds me now of the similar nausea-preventing movement systems seen in many virtual reality games. Here, being able to go from one hidden corner to another without the risk of being seen revolutionizes the stealth gameplay.</p>
<p>Hopping up to a nearby rooftop or down on top of an unaware enemy with a quick blink is incredibly satisfying, making you feel less like a crawling assassin and more like a bona fide superhero. The same goes for the “dark vision” that lets you see enemies and allies through walls, an ability that’s all the more necessary in a game without any sort of mini-map to help you get the lie of the land.</p>

<p>In contrast to the elegant, super-powered sneaking, combat in <em>Dishonored</em> can feel a bit slow and clunky. This is exacerbated by the game’s “chaos system,” which sends seemingly endless waves of enemies that turn each violent engagement into a war of attrition against a nearly overwhelming force.</p>
<p>It’s usually a better idea to simply blink away to safety until they quickly call off the pursuit. Or, better yet, just avoid combat altogether by sticking to the shadows, coming out only when you can take out your next assassination target cleanly and silently.</p>
<p>In a lesser game, the assassination-focused gameplay could threaten to feel too repetitive. But <em>Dishonored</em>‘s structure encourages different paths to that same final goal in each mission, from magically assisted sneaking to social manipulation and eavesdropping to actually taking a moral stand in a long-running feud.</p>
<p>Add in side quests that offer plenty of opportunity for creative problem solving, and you have a game that encourages multiple playthroughs to explore all the different ways you can succeed. That should provide enough of an excuse to revisit <em>Dishonored</em>, or to dive in for the first time if you missed it during its debut.</p>

            <link>https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/digital-foundry-covers-the-disappointing-tech-in-pokemon-legends-z-a</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/digital-foundry-covers-the-disappointing-tech-in-pok%C3%A9mon-legends-z-a.1354000/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>

<p>Our pals over at <a href="https://www.digitalfoundry.net/reviews/pokemon-legends-z-a-has-a-massive-cross-gen-gap">Digital Foundry</a> have provided their verdict on the recently-released <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pokemon-legends-z-a-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a> on Switch and Switch 2, covering the tech utilised and the performance gap between the two consoles.</p>
<p>Looking at the visuals in the sole location of Lumiose City, Digital Foundry states that the execution is rough around the edges, looking "garish" even on the Switch 2. One particular highlight is the fact that the majority of NPCs found on your travels are motionless; rooted the spot in set locations (and yes, we've also covered this in a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/opinion-pokemon-legends-z-a-is-the-creepiest-entry-yet-not-in-a-good-way">previous feature piece</a>).</p>
<p>Both versions feature copious pop-in, while many of the pedestrians also pop-<em>out</em> when you move closer to them. On a positive note, however, Switch 2 features a lot more detail in the environments, with sharper textures in general. However, the repeated flat texture maps for the buildings' windows and balconies is called out as being a huge negative, with pixelated visuals when you get close up.</p>
<p>Switch 2's biggest upgrade comes with its overall image quality. It utilises DLSS upscaling to bring the resolution up to a 1440p target while docked and 1080p in handheld mode, and the difference between the two consoles is night and day. Meanwhile, frame rate for the Switch targets 30fps, but often drops down into the 20s when panning the camera around. The Switch 2, meanwhile, is locked at 60fps with only very rare drops.</p>
<p>Pretty much what we'd expected, then, but it's lovely to get a proper breakdown from the tech experts over at Digital Foundry. You can check out their full verdict and more over on their brand new website.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-out-now-immediately-called-out-for-ai-slop/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-is-out-and-it%E2%80%99s-immediately-being-called-out-for-being-filled-with-ai-slop.1353997/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 is officially out on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S. If you pre-loaded the game, you can jump in right now and start your journey with the latest release in the annual shooter mega-franchise, seeing everything this year's entry has to offer. Which, players have immediately noticed, also includes a slew of AI-generated slop used for in-game rewards.</p>



<p>This isn't the first time we've seen Activision use generative AI for assets within Call of Duty. It did so <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/ai-is-already-taking-jobs-in-the-video-game-industry/">in 2023 for Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3</a> and <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/activision-finally-admits-it-uses-generative-ai-for-some-call-of-duty-black-ops-6-assets-after-backlash-following-ai-slop-zombie-santa-loading-screen">in 2024 for Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</a>, with both instances facing severe backlash from players. So we can't really be surprised that there's AI slop stuffed into Call of Duty: Black Ops 7, but what is surprising is just how much of it fills the game.</p>



<p>User <a href="https://x.com/Kumesicles/status/1988982194916999619">Kumesicles on X (formerly Twitter)</a> shared an image of the in-game calling card rewards that all feature AI-generated assets, with their post becoming the lightning rod that is drawing plenty of attention, but it's not the only example of AI assets in the game.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Activision also used AI-generated assets within the campaign, and for the prestige icons that players grind hours to attain. It's also likely that there are more AI assets to be found, though at the time of this writing and considering that the game only released today, these examples are the ones that have caught players' eyes and ire the most.</p>



<p>The replies to Kumesicles' post are a quick look at how players feel about the game being stuffed with AI slop for these assets, even if they are a small part of the game. Another look is <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3606480/Call_of_Duty_Black_Ops_7/#app_reviews_hash">the game's Steam page</a>, where several player reviews are also criticizing the use of AI slop, on top of other issues with the game, like how the campaign cannot be paused, is always online, and will kick you from a level if you go AFK, forcing you to restart it.</p>



<p>At some point, you really have to wonder what you're paying for here. Cosmetic changes for your character and your profile in games make good goals for players to reach and good microtransactions because they were, historically, carefully crafted by artists to look cool, so that when you saw it, you wanted to grind the hours it would take to earn those small calling cards and profile pins, to have them on your profile as a badge of your own gaming prowess.</p>



<p>Of course, that's not the whole Call of Duty experience, but having a cool-looking profile that flashes when you get the winning kill of a match or make the best play in a round is an ingrained aspect of the quintessential Call of Duty experience. Why should you be getting less than what you got in previous games? It's not like Activision can't pay artists to make something that players might actually want to have on their profiles.</p>



<p>It may be a small element of the game, but it's a big showcase of just how much Activision does not care about getting the details right. So long as Call of Duty remains the commercial juggernaut it's been for over a decade, Activision will continue to degrade its quality to see how much it can get away with ripping players off. Even if Activision backtracks and replaces these assets with art actually made by humans, we have no reason not to expect the same rigamarole next year, likely even more egregious than what we're seeing now.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Kirby Air Riders could end up being one of the sleeper hits of 2025 for Nintendo, and if you’re a Switch or Switch 2 user eager to know if everyone’s small, round, pink cutie is coming to old-gen or current-gen hardware, you’ve raced into the right place.</p>



<p>Since day one, the differentiation between games, hardware, updates, and other issues has been unclear for the Nintendo Switch and its Switch 2 successor. It’s like this will continue for several years yet. This is where we come in to tell you which pit lane you need to go to for <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/kirby-air-riders-release-date-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kirby Air Riders</a>.</p>



<p>The spiritual successor to 2003’s Kirby Air Riders has a lot of competition to catch up.</p>

<p><strong>Kirby Air Riders is most definitely launching on the Nintendo Switch 2 when its November 20 release date finally arrives.</strong></p>



<p>The Switch 2 has had a decent amount of exclusives in its first year. Mario Kart World, Donkey Kong Bananza, and the upcoming Metroid Prime 4: Beyond are system-selling starlets. But Nintendo isn’t content with this, which is why we’re getting another exclusive—and another racer at that.</p>



<p>You could say Kirby Air Riders isn’t the type of game everyone has been crying out for, but we won’t say no. It should provide competition and another option to Nintendo racing fans. The main thing that wasn’t in doubt was the game releasing on the Nintendo Switch 2, though.</p>



<h2 id="h-can-you-play-kirby-air-riders-on-nintendo-switch-1">Can You Play Kirby Air Riders On Nintendo Switch 1?</h2>



<p><strong>You can’t buy and play Kirby Air Riders on the OG Nintendo Switch, making it a Switch 2 exclusive.</strong></p>



<p>A Switch 2 port was never in doubt, but the original Nintendo Switch was touch-and-go. We’re already sensing a theme with big-time Nintendo exclusives—Metroid Prime 4 aside. The old-gen hardware has served its purpose and attracted well over 150 million buyers. Now, the race is on for Switch 2 to surpass the device it succeeded.</p>



<p>How do you do this? By restricting the availability of shiny new Nintendo titles. Kirby Air Riders is only coming to Nintendo Switch 2, which means if you’re keen to ride the airy waves, you need to make a Kirby-sized jump to the Switch 2.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-kirby-air-riders-on-any-other-platform">Is Kirby Air Riders On Any Other Platform?</h2>



<p><strong>Kirby Air Riders isn’t coming to PlayStation, Xbox, or PC; it’s only available on the Nintendo Switch 2.</strong></p>



<p>We thought we’d address this question quickly, especially in this day and age of exclusives and first-party titles flying here, there, and everywhere. Kirby Air Riders is coming to Switch 2 and nothing else.</p>



<p>Are you excited for Kirby Air Riders? Can it be a force in the kart-racing genre, battling Mario Kart, Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds, and others?

            <title><![CDATA[EXCLUSIVE: Dying Light: Hellrunners—The Zombie Game That Never Made It]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/dying-light-hellrunners-zombie-game-never-made-it/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/exclusive-dying-light-hellrunners%E2%80%94the-zombie-game-that-never-made-it.1353982/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Dying Light fans have been enjoying The Beast since mid-September, and thanks to updates made by Techland, it’s proving to be a gift that keeps on giving. In case you’re uninitiated with The Beast, the game effectively sets up the next generation of Dying Light, an open-world zombie slasher title that has existed since 2015.</p>



<p>However, not <strong>every Dying Light game </strong>ever concocted has made it to the market. In 2015, the Techland team released Dying Light, then in 2022 came Dying Light 2: Stay Human. But between those games sat a whole array of concept titles, and one in particular would have been a total genre pivot for fans of the relatively new franchise.</p>



<h2 id="h-dying-light-hellrunners-laid-to-rest">Dying Light: Hellrunners Laid to Rest</h2>



<p>Between 2016 and 2017, the team at Techland was busy innovating in the Dying Light space, and one title that came out of the creative minds of those at the firm was Dying Light: Hellrunners.</p>



<p>Hellrunners would have been a ‘runner’; a game that typically uses procedural generation or a never-ending loop to permit the player to, you guessed it, <strong>run forever</strong>. As the player traverses an endless pathway, they’re faced with obstacles to repeatedly overcome while securing points, coins, tokens, or something else entirely.</p>



<p>However, Techland was quick to point out that the endless approach was just one angle, and that the team was also trying out a ‘level-based’ approach.</p>



<p>Think of a game like Canabalt, a horizontally-scrolling endless runner, but add in nicer graphics, is what I was told. Then, throw in the undead and some parkour mechanics, and you’re probably close to picturing Dying Light: Hellrunners.</p>



<figure><figcaption>Canabalt is a side-scrolling endless runner with a single-button input that kept players engaged by demanding them to dodge obstacles</figcaption></figure>







<p>I caught up with Techland’s Tymon Smektala, Franchise Director, to learn more about Hellrunners and why the game never saw the light of day:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We experimented with a runner DL game but after some prototypes realized that there’s not much we can do to make it stand out or innovate within the genre.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>With that, Hellrunners was shelved, never to be revisited, and the team moved on to piece together Dying Light 2: Stay Human.</p>



<p>Being a Dying Light fan, I was curious to learn if there were any relations between ‘Hellrunners’ and ‘Nightrunners’, the faction that exists within Villedor in Dying Light 2: Stay Human.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>There was no connection between Hellrunners and Nightrunners – Nightrunners were conceptualized later in the production of Dying Light 2: Stay Human, long when Hellrunners was altogether scrapped.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It’s easy to imagine Dying Light: Hellrunners as a pretty gnarly mobile game. Runners are still pretty popular today, but they’re mostly hyper-casual experiences that offer little in the way of gameplay depth and are mostly time-killer titles.</p>



<p>I could just picture Dying Light: Hellrunners, though. I can imagine obstacles being items to vault or leap over, gaps that need to be crossed with a well-timed grapple hook, and undead lumbering in your path that need to be struck down as you run, all while you collect UV bars, coins, or vials of Antizin.</p>



<p>Do you wish Dying Light: Hellrunners had been made in the end? Let me know what you’re thinking on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/Bhv3AMa5a9">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

However, playing solo isn't necessarily the easier route, and it might take a bit longer to complete alone.</p>

                <p>Once you've gone on enough raids and worked your way through some quests, you can eventually gain access to Stella Montis, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/arc-raiders/" data-ref-id="5000-546105">Arc Raiders</a>' first post-launch map. While you're exploring this new map, you'll want to make sure you're working on Lance's quest In My Image, which tasks you with finding and looting three androids in Stella Montis. And about that--we have some good news and bad news we'll dive into further down.</p><p>Before heading in, be aware that you don't need to extract from Stella Montis to complete In My Image, so you can always bring in a free loadout if you just want to navigate this labyrinthine map in search of androids. By doing so, you'll eliminate any major loss of resources if you find yourself in a bad situation and don't get out.</p><p>When you're ready to set off, here's how to complete In My Image.</p><h2>Where to find androids for the In My Image quest</h2><p>Though Androids can be found on other maps, you'll need to specifically find Androids on the Stella Montis map to complete this quest. They look like the same androids that you may have encountered on the lower levels of Blue Gate, but only the ones in Stella Montis can actually be looted. Well, some of them, anyway. Remember when we said we had some good news and bad news?</p><p>The bad news is that <strong>there is no specific spot on the map dedicated to finding androids</strong>, meaning you'll just need to explore the map thoroughly to come across random locations where these inactive robotic humanoids are leaned against walls or splayed out on the floor. Additionally, not every android you come across in Stella Montis can be looted. Some are static and can't be interacted with at all, which means you'll need to keep an eye out specifically for those that have a little icon show up over their bodies indicating that you can loot them.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4602569-19a8334cd9c61-screenshoturl.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4602569" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4602569-19a8334cd9c61-screenshoturl.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4602569"></a><figcaption>Loot three androids to complete In My Image.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4602569-19a8334cd9c61-screenshoturl.jpg"></figure><p>But there's some good news, too. Androids aren't that rare in Stella Montis. You may need to walk around for a while checking rooms and hallways, but with enough time (and a sharp eye), you'll almost certainly come across enough of them to complete the quest within a run or two. Make sure you're checking corners and other areas that aren't in your direct line of sight, as the androids can sometimes be sitting in spots you wouldn't expect.</p><p>Once you've found and looted three androids, you will complete In My Image and be ready to return to Lance in Speranza. Head to one of the Stella Montis extraction points while being careful to avoid other raiders and the Shredder enemies roaming the area, then make your way back to continue to the next quest.</p><p>For more on this extraction shooter, check out our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/all-arc-raiders-quests-full-mission-list/1100-6535922/" data-ref-id="1100-6535922">full Arc Raiders quest list</a>.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Valve Talks The Next Steam Deck | GameSpot News</p>
      </div>
<p>"Obviously, the Steam Deck's not our focus today, but the same things we've said in the past where we're really interested to work on what's next for Steam Deck," Griffais explained. "The thing we're making sure of is that it's a worthwhile enough performance upgrade to make sense as a standalone product."</p><p>In Griffais' summation, Valve doesn't just want a better battery in the Steam Deck 2--though that would be a welcome improvement, considering it was a point of contention in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/steam-deck-review-redefinition/1100-6500986/" data-ref-id="1100-6500986">GameSpot's Steam Deck review</a>. Instead, the company wants something more substantial, an upgrade that makes the new handheld worthy of being a Steam Deck successor. To get there, the available Systems on a Chip (SoC) need to catch up to Valve's ambitions.</p><p>"We're not interested in getting to a point where it's 20 or 30 or even 50% more performance at the same battery life," Griffais continued. "We want something a little bit more demarcated than that. So we've been working back from silicon advancements and architectural improvements, and I think we have a pretty good idea of what the next version of Steam Deck is going to be, but right now there's no offerings in that landscape, in the SoC landscape, that we think would truly be a next-gen performance Steam Deck."</p><p>This lines up with what Griffais has previously said regarding Valve building a Steam Deck 2. Speaking to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/9/21/23884863/valve-steam-deck-2-refresh-upgrade-cpu-2025" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Verge in September 2023</a>, Griffais explained that the company is waiting for a "significant enough increase" in performance technology, suggesting an upgraded Steam Deck may not arrive until 2026. </p><p>"We also don't want more performance to come at a significant cost to power efficiency and battery life," Griffais said at the time. "I don’t anticipate such a leap to be possible in the next couple of years, but we’re still closely monitoring innovations in architectures and fabrication processes to see where things are going there."</p><p>Released in February 2022, the company launched <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/steam-deck-oled-release-better-screen-battery-life/1100-6519051/" data-ref-id="1100-6519051">a revised Steam Deck in November 2023</a> that retained the same performance as the original model but included an OLED display. This Steam Deck 2 sounds like it'll be a much more powerful device, so long as the technology Valve hopes for comes to fruition.</p><p>While a Steam Deck 2 may be a little ways away, the company's imminent hardware lineup is coming out soon. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/valve-reveals-new-hardware-lineup-a-controller-compact-gaming-pc-and-vr-ready-headset/1100-6536148/" data-ref-id="1100-6536148">The Steam Controller, Steam Frame, and Steam Machine</a> are all shipping in early 2026, and while we don't know the prices just yet, hardware engineer Yazan Aldehayyat said <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-much-will-steam-machine-cost-heres-what-valve-had-to-say-about-pricing/1100-6536161/" data-ref-id="1100-6536161">affordability is a key concern</a> for Valve.</p>

            <p>With the release of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-7">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</a>, eager fans have criticised Activision for its in-game calling cards seemingly created using generative AI.</p>
<p>The calling cards in question belong to the 'Jack of All Trades' campaign challenges, as well as two specific calling cards in the 'Embrace the Nightmare' campaign endgame challenges. These cards appear, in the eyes of members of the Call of Duty community, similar to AI Studio Ghibli recreations which have been circulating online for the past few months.</p>
<p>Activision has declared AI was used during the development of Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3606480/Call_of_Duty_Black_Ops_7/">the game's Steam page</a>. The mandatory disclaimer notes: "Our team uses generative AI tools to help develop some in game assets." While the disclaimer does not specify which assets have been made using AI, players are speculating these calling cards are a clear example.</p>

<p>These calling cards have circulated online, both <a href="https://x.com/Kumesicles/status/1988984517823197541">on social media</a> as well as <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CODBlackOps7/comments/1owqr38/so_these_calling_cards_are_definitely_ai/">the game's Reddit page</a>. The reaction is mixed, with some enraged at the apparent use of AI in a full price video game. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CODBlackOps7/comments/1owqr38/comment/nosyn0q/?context=3">Take user Commercial_Pirate501</a>, who wrote: "It cost 96 dollars in my country and more than 130 dollars for vault edition lol. I personally enjoy this game, but this is [a] ridiculous amount of money for a game with tons of AI generated content."</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><p dir="ltr" lang="en">I havent really looked at the Multiplayer and Zombie calling cards as closely and im willing to bet they're using ai on those too but its only the Campaign and endgame calling cards that are this type of blatant Sora/Grok artstyle <a href="https://t.co/5qmEXhoQkJ">pic.twitter.com/5qmEXhoQkJ</a></p>— Kume (@Kumesicles) <a href="https://twitter.com/Kumesicles/status/1989327996126126344?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 14, 2025</a></blockquote></div>

<p>Another user on Reddit, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CODBlackOps7/comments/1owqr38/comment/nos0szi/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">Loqh9 summerised their thoughts more succinctly</a>, writing: "Damn that's awful fuck this".</p>
<p>Alternatively, others are uncaring of possible AI use. For example you have <a href="https://x.com/MEFestof1l/status/1989342779005362572">M3Festof1l on X</a>, who commented: "This looks normal. I don't give a shit who or what created the image as long as it looks normal." These are of course just a few opinions in what is a wider debate both on AI use in Call of Duty: Black Ops 7, and game development as a whole.</p>
<p>Eurogamer has reached out to Activision to determine whether these calling cards and others were created using generative AI.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-is-thriving-claims-ceo-doubling-down-on-ai-after-9000-employees-lost-jobs-in-latest-layoffs">CEO of Microsoft Satya Nadella stated "Microsoft is Thriving" after the company laid off 9,000 employees in a double-down on AI</a>. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-has-finally-bought-activision-blizzard">Microsoft formerly acquired Activision Blizzard in late 2023</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Valve believes the new Steam Machine can succeed where the first models failed, and according to two senior engineers, the reason is simple: the software finally caught up, leading to a wider game catalogue.</p>



<p>Speaking with <a data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/why-a-new-steam-machine-when-the-first-ones-flopped-because-this-time-valve-say-itll-actually-have-games">Rock Paper Shotgun</a>, Yazan Aldehayyat stated that one of the reasons the original Steam Machines failed was the lack of software, as very few games were compatible with SteamOS (based on Linux), and only a few games could run well using other compatibility tools like Wine.</p>



<p><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">"We learned from the first Steam Machines that we needed to make our developers’ lives a lot easier," </em>Aldehayyat said. <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">"So now we have Proton, right? Which is essentially just a compatibility layer that lets games run on Linux, that are originally meant for Windows.</em>"</p>



<p>Pierre-Loup Griffais echoes the sentiment, saying that the small game catalogue was the reason the older Steam Machines failed, highlighting that many of the features of the new Steam Machine, such as the ease of use that's closer to a console than a PC, were already there. And with the system seeing limited adoption, developers had no incentive to develop Linux ports of their games. The work done on Proton since the launch of the Steam Deck has now ensured the new Steam Machine will have a big game catalogue from launch.</p>



<p>SteamOS has also been improved a lot since the launch of the original Steam Machine, and plenty of performance optimization work has been done on the operating system to improve the Steam Deck performance. For the new system, Valve has done <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">"a tonne of work on desktop performance, ray tracing, and all that stuff,"</em> and now, it is expected that the same performance advantages introduced on Steam Deck over time after its launch with work on SteamOS will be available on the new Steam Machine as well.</p>



<h2 id="h-with-good-software-optimization-the-new-steam-machine-could-punch-well-above-its-specs">With Good Software Optimization, the new Steam Machine Could Punch Well Above Its Specs</h2>



<p>The new Valve system won't be a powerhouse exactly. Its official technical specifications, revealed earlier this week, which you can find below, position the system between the Xbox Series S and the PlayStation 5.</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th>Category</th><th>Specification</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>I/O</strong></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Displays</td><td><strong>DisplayPort 1.4:</strong><br>- Up to 4K @ 240Hz or 8K@60Hz<br>- Supports HDR, FreeSync, daisy-chaining<br><strong>HDMI 2.0:</strong><br>- Up to 4K @ 120Hz<br>- Supports HDR, FreeSync, CEC</td></tr><tr><td>USB</td><td>- Two USB-A 3.2 Gen 1 (front)<br>- Two USB-A 2.0 High speed (back)<br>- One USB-C 3.2 Gen 2 (back)</td></tr><tr><td>Networking</td><td>Gigabit ethernet</td></tr><tr><td>LED Strip</td><td>17 individually addressable RGB LEDs for system status and customization</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Size &amp; Weight</strong></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Size</td><td>152 mm tall (148 mm without feet), 162.4 mm deep, 156 mm wide</td></tr><tr><td>Weight</td><td>2.6 kg</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Software</strong></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Operating System</td><td>SteamOS 3 (Arch-based)</td></tr><tr><td>Desktop</td><td>KDE Plasma</td></tr><tr><td><strong>General</strong></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>CPU</td><td>Semi-custom AMD Zen 4 6 Cores /12 Threads<br>- Up to 4.8 GHz, 30W TDP</td></tr><tr><td>GPU</td><td>Semi-custom AMD RDNA3 28 Compute Units<br>- 2.45GHz max sustained clock, 110W TDP</td></tr><tr><td>RAM</td><td>16GB DDR5 + 8GB GDDR6 VRAM</td></tr><tr><td>Power</td><td>Internal power supply, AC 110-240V</td></tr><tr><td>Storage</td><td>Two models, both with a high-speed microSD slot:<br>- 512GB NVMe SSD<br>- 2TB NVMe SSD</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Connectivity</strong></td><td></td></tr><tr><td>Wi-Fi</td><td>2x2 Wi-Fi 6E</td></tr><tr><td>Bluetooth</td><td>Bluetooth 5.3 with a dedicated antenna</td></tr><tr><td>Steam Controller</td><td>Integrated 2.4 GHz Steam Controller wireless adapter</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>Although the new Steam Machine is expected to run games at 4K@60Hz, early tests suggest some games, such as Cyberpunk 2077, may struggle to hit these performance targets. The system, however, is still far from launch, and with further improvements to its software side, the new Steam Machine could deliver better performance than in its current pre-release state, although the 8 GB of VRAM is definitely a limiting factor, and will be even more so in the future.</p>



<p>And if the new Steam Machine becomes as popular as the Steam Deck, it wouldn't be surprising to see either presets dedicated to the machine or even Steam Machine native builds that deliver better performance, as we have seen with <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://wccftech.com/baldurs-gate-3-steam-deck-native-performance-act-3/">Baldur's Gate 3</a> and <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/cronos-the-new-dawn-native-steam-deck-build-performance/">Cronos: The New Dawn native builds.</a></p>



<h2 id="h-price-will-determine-the-steam-machine-s-success">Price Will Determine the Steam Machine's Success</h2>



<p>With the game catalogue issue of the original Steam Machines solved, it will likely be the price that determines the success of the Steam Machine. Valve is well aware of this, and <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://wccftech.com/steam-machine-pricing-will-be-really-competitive-with-building-a-similar-pc/">Yazan Aldehayyat confirmed it will be very competitive</a>. How much it will be remains to be seen, as the cost of the system when <a href="https://wccftech.com/valve-unveils-steam-frame-steam-machine-steam-controller-launch-early-2026/">it launches early next year</a> has yet to be confirmed.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>As if the cataclysm and the horrors it unleashed weren't enough, the constant rain we've had for months has empowered the kappa that also plagues us. But a monk has a plan to stop the rain, and your group of adventurers is needed for the mission. In this article, we check out the 2 new supplements for <em>Hametsu</em>, The Ryu and the Rain narrative expansion, and <em>Hamestu</em> Legends Mushashi.</p>

<p><em>Hamestu</em> is an apocalyptic fantasy narrative wargame set in 16th-century Japan. You can check out our review of the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/hametsu-core-rulebook-review" rel="nofollow">core rulebook</a>&nbsp;and a <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/features/hametsu-miniatures-showcase-heroes-and-enemies-of-cataclysm" rel="nofollow">miniatures showcase</a> for the heroes and enemies from the core rulebook.</p>

Always rain [Credit: Black Site Studios - <em>Hametsu</em> Legends Musashi]</figcaption></figure><h2>Playing In The Cataclysm</h2>

<p><em>Hametsu</em> is a tabletop wargame for 1 to 4 players, which means it can be played solo or cooperatively against AI-controlled enemies. While Black Site Studios produces miniatures for the heroes and enemies for <em>Hametsu</em> (along with some awesome scenery), it's a miniature agnostic system, so you can use any miniatures you wish to play (but you should absolutely pick up their official miniatures, or STLs to print yourself).</p>

<p>Games of <em>Hametsu</em> take place over 3 unique phases. In the Stealth phase, players try to sneak around, avoiding the AI-controlled enemies who use the orders detailed in the scenario. In the Clash phase, enemies are aware of the players and attack them using their individual instinct rules. During both phases, players try to investigate clues, looking to move the game into the Boss phase, where the lesser enemies flee to make way for a larger and more dangerous enemy.</p>

<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/hametsu-ryu-and-the-rain-and-musashi-2.jpg?itok=NkdrHDw4 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/hametsu-ryu-and-the-rain-and-musashi-2.jpg?itok=tLJwo2Iz 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>As you grow, so do your enemies [Credit: Black Site Studios - <em>Hametsu</em> Ryu and the Rain]</figcaption></figure><h2>Only Rain</h2>

<p>The<em> Hametsu </em>Ryu and the Rain narrative<em>&nbsp;</em>expansion book&nbsp;includes a load of new content for your games, but it's aimed at veteran hunters who've reached level 8 or more. It includes an alternative wound tracking mode to speed up combat for higher-level hunters, and a path of mastery to take your hunters from level 8 to 12, along with the levelling up bonuses for all 12 classes from the <em>Hametsu</em> core rulebook.</p>

<p>To go along with the extra levels for your hunters, there are new scenarios, Time Trial, Dungeon Crawl, and Wave Defence, which all function as they sound, and an advanced version of all 6 of the bosses from the core rulebook. These advanced versions offer a real challenge, like the&nbsp;Shikigami Horde, of which you now have to face 3, who heal and upgrade every time you take one out, until you're left with one final super&nbsp;Shikigami to face.</p>

<p>The book closes with the Ryu and the Rain campaign, aimed at level 8 hunters who will level up using the book's path of mastery. The campaign sees the hunters traveling across Japan, using a map to track their route and guides for the scenery as they travel, detailing changes to the landscape as they progress. It also introduces a new enemy type, the Kappa. These turtle-like creatures are empowered by water, and taking them out of action can be difficult, as they have a 1 in 3 chance of coming back after being reduced to 0 wounds.</p>

<p>The book and campaign are a very welcome expansion, allowing you to progress with hunters that you've already invested time in. The advanced bosses offer a real challenge, even for path of mastery hunters, and it makes me wonder what's next if you can advance your hunters beyond level 12. Maybe no minions, only bosses in scenarios, multiple different bosses at the same time, or some brand new epic-level bosses to face. The Kappa are fun to fight, and very thematic in the rain-based campaign, which is captured very well as you travel across Japan using the map and changing scenery guide.</p>

<p>The <em>Hametsu </em>Musashi expansion book is the start of a series of <em>Hametsu</em> Legends titles that will offer solo narrative campaigns featuring Japanese heroes of legend. This first one is about Miyamoto Musashi, a famous Japanese duelist and author of the classic Book of the Five Rings.</p>

<p><em>Hametsu</em> Legends Musashi features the profile for Musashi, including his path of legend to Level 8. Musashi, famous for his 2 swords technique, can use both the katana and the shorter wakizashi at the same time, gaining a bonus to melee and resilience (to show the offensive and defensive bonus of wielding 2 blades), and deals damage with both weapons on each success.</p>

<p>The core of the book features an 8-scenario campaign for Musashi to work through solo, and the rules for the Kappa enemies (as featured in the Ryu and the Rain expansion book) and a new Kappa boss for Musashi to face. It's a great campaign, and it works well as an intro to the Ryu and the Rain campaign, especially if you put Musashi into your group (as even capping at level 8, he still holds his own with level 12 hunters). The Musashi campaign is solo play, as it features Musashi as the only playable hero.</p>

<p>The rules for Ryu and the Rain and Musashi are available in both digital and physical formats. The miniatures, however, unlike the initial wave of <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/features/hametsu-miniatures-showcase-heroes-and-enemies-of-cataclysm" rel="nofollow">Hametsu miniatures</a>, were only available at preorder and are now only available as 3D-printable STL files from <a href="https://blacksitestudio.com/en-gb/pages/hametsu-digital-products" rel="nofollow">Black Site Studios</a>. There you can pick up a 3D file for Musashi and, separately as a bundle, all the Kappa miniatures for use in the Ryu and the Rain and Musashi campaign. This isn't great for those without a 3D printer, but as a miniatures agnostic system, you can use other available miniatures.</p>

<p><em>Hametsu</em>&nbsp;Ryu and the Rain and <em>Hametsu</em> Legends Musashi are both fantastic expansions.&nbsp;The Musashi campaign is a great solo campaign following one of Japan's most famous swordsmen and serves as a nice introduction to the Ryu and the Rain campaign. Ryu and the Rain is great for expanding your games beyond your heroes maxing out at Level 8, and is a full product for levelling them up. The new campaign, enemies, upgraded bosses, and paths of mastery are extremely welcome for keeping your games going, and the new scenario types provide challenging repeat play.</p>

Cicadamata" - yes the rogue apostrophes are part of the official title, yes I will exclude them in future because they make my thalamus itch - is one of those games that makes me incandescently sorry I didn't spend the past 20 years studying graphics design so that I could, for example, tell you what exactly is going on with that icecream bar HUD, those landscapes of bright diodes and cubes sliding through checkerboard obelisks, those twirling android digits, that wrist-rolling Muji paperweight of a shotgun.

The best I can do is defensively blurt words like "stylish" and "stylised" and fish desperately into my decreasing pocketful of "Cool" pop and gaming precedents and trends. This looks like... a frantic arena <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">FPS</a> set inside the menu of a classic WipEout game? Like, er, a playable vaporwave album? I feel like we've <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/i-cant-stop-trying-to-go-faster-in-neon-white-even-with-a-record-time">invoked</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ok-normal-is-a-psx-era-nightmare">vaporwave</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/broken-reality-out-now-with-demo">a lot</a> on here, and need to start identifying subgenres of vapors and waves. Look, why don't you watch the trailer while I try to nail down a gloss. Usefully for my dignity, you will not be able to read the words below the video embed because your eyes will have popped out of your skull.

Hello again! Assuming you still have connected retinas, I have some updates: people on the socials have been comparing Cicadamata to nu-<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/marathon">Marathon</a>, and it seems the developer, flowergarden, is <a href="https://x.com/onaeire/status/1989042466876485726">some kind of fan</a>. I can certainly see a little of the upcoming Bungie game's art direction in there, though thankfully, none of its extraction-shooteriness. As <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3817250/CICADAMATA/">the Steam page</a> explains, this is a mix of platformer, shooter and speedrunning game in which you "hop, skip, and jump to become one with joyeuse, until you are no longer you". At the risk of blunting the hyperactive swagger of that Steam page, it looks like you play some kind of robot rabbit, Fawn-A2, and you'll be "tearing flesh from bone" in "15+ freeform levels across 6 spheres".
</p><p>
Hang on, robot rabbits! I know what this reminds me of: Jumping Flash! All those downward-looking ground-slams in the trailer are a dead ringer for the 1995 PS1 game, as are the chirrupy whoops and bops of the kill and platforming effects. Robbit wasn't this lethal, though - it's like he's been modded into Ultrakill. Cicadamata is out in 2026.
