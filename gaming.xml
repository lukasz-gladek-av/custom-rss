			<p>A new Final Fantasy VII Rebirth mod that's now available for download for free introduces a highly requested feature that is only available in a limited capacity in the vanilla game.</p>
<p>The Dresscode mod developed by YIIS, which can be downloaded from <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/finalfantasy7rebirth/mods/1062?tab=description" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nexus Mods</a>, introduces a system that lets users change character outfits and weapons in-game dynamically. The tool not only supports all the base game outfits, requiring <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/finalfantasy7rebirth/mods/1071">another mod</a> to unlock those not normally available via the changing booth, but also modded outfits, of which quite a few are available online. Before downloading the mod, you can check it out in action in the video below.</p>
<p><iframe title="FF7R Dresscode Mod" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EbOMnUSq_UM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Though the Final Fantasy VII Rebirth modding scene is not as big as that of other titles, plenty of great mods have been developed since the game's PC launch early this year. While the first few mods were, unsurprisingly, on the simple side, the unofficial additions made to the second entry in the remake trilogy have gradually become better and better, and have gone as far as adding completely new <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth-new-mods-new-playable-characters/">playable characters</a>, such as the Turks Rude and Reno.</p>
<p>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth is now available on PC and PlayStation 5 worldwide. You can learn more about one of the best role-playing games released this generation by checking out Kai's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth/">review.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/will-gta-6-be-s-tier-rank-every-rockstar-game<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Which Rockstar game do you think is the greatest?</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">A new GTA 6 trailer is here and, in case you missed it, we <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/89-details-from-the-gta-6-trailer-2"><u>broke down all of the secrets and details</u></a> from it. Sadly, though, we’re going to have to wait until May 26, 2026, to actually play Lucia and Jason’s story. So, in the meantime, why don’t we think about all of the Rockstar games we’ve already enjoyed over the years and rank them for fun?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Rockstar has developed and released over 30 games since its creation in 1998, and is responsible for famous series such as Grand Theft Auto, Red Dead Redemption, and Manhunt. But which comes out on top? Just to clarify, you won’t see the likes of LA Noire or Max Payne 2 here, as we’ve strictly gone with Rockstar-developed games, rather than ones the studio has published. I’ve had a go at ranking them via one of our IGN Tier Lists, purely taking into account my personal enjoyment of each game over the years. Take a look at my tier list here:</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/07/screenshot-2025-05-07-at-12-08-59-1746616161781.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Red Dead Redemption 2 is simply my favourite game of all time, so it was a pretty easy S-tier pick for me if I’m honest. It’s (perhaps unsurprisingly) joined its predecessor and GTA 5 in that category – both pioneers of the cinematic open world genre. I also have a particular soft spot for Max Payne 3 and its bullet time ballet, as well as GTA San Andreas (a game I played at a way too young age). Down at the bottom in the D-tier, we have the likes of Austin Powers: Oh, Behave! and Welcome to My Underground Lair!, a game that literally nobody in their right mind wants to play.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Don’t agree with me? Think that Vice City is better than GTA 4? Well, why not have a go at ranking all of Rockstar’s games yourself in a tier list below, where you can compare your own S, A, B, C, and D tiers with the whole of the IGN community.</p><div id="every-rockstar-game-tier-list" data-cy="tierlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Every Rockstar Game Tier List</h3><h3>Every Rockstar Game Tier List</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">We may have only seen two trailers so far, but where do you think GTA 6 will end up ranking when all is said and done? Let us know in the comments, as well as why you’ve ranked the games in the order you’ve chosen.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Simon Cardy is a Senior Editor at IGN who can mainly be found skulking around open world games, indulging in Korean cinema, or despairing at the state of Tottenham Hotspur and the New York Jets.

Eagle-eyed fans spotted that the presidents on the cash seen in a screenshot of the club in GTA 6 are the same as those from Red Dead Redemption 2’s cigarette cards (Thaddeus Waxman and Franklin Hardin).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s worth noting this is an incidental detail, and GTA and Red Dead existing in the same universe does not amount to much at the end of the day (although some are now suggesting Jason may be a descendant of Arthur Morgan, given the two look sort of alike). But it shows that there are connections between the two Rockstar IPs that may be strengthened further when GTA 6 comes out.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now onto some juicy stuff. There is a brief moment in the trailer early on when Jason walks into his house, and the camera moves into what looks like an over the shoulder, third-person perspective. There is little sign of gameplay in Trailer 2, but fans are theorizing that this cutscene may seamlessly transition into the beginning of GTA 6, with players thrust into controlling Jason as he walks around his house.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If true, it may be the case that GTA 6 features two of these sections: one for Jason and one for Lucia, the game’s second playable protagonist. The theory here is that GTA 6 will feature a similar transition into gameplay moment for Lucia, helping the player get to grips with the dual protagonist gameplay ahead of the time-skip to when Lucia leaves prison.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Moving on, fans are focusing their attention on an image transition on the recently updated official GTA 6 website, which sees the camera swing around from spotlighting Jason to spotlighting Lucia as they share an embrace.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Some are wondering if this is a character select screen that might display when you load the game. The expectation is you’ll be able to swap between Jason and Lucia during gameplay, but perhaps GTA 6 gives you the chance to pick between the two upon getting back into the game, and if so, this could be what we’ll see.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are all sorts of theories on the nature of Jason and Lucia’s relationship and where the story will take it. I’ve seen everything from speculation that Jason is an undercover cop to either Jason or Lucia or perhaps even both dying at the end of the story. Most seem convinced either Jason or Lucia betrays the other at some point, which would be criminal. Perhaps we’ll get to choose via an optional ending system.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Just a note on the Jason is a cop theory: Jason tells the prison security guard, when picking up Lucia, that he might have been there before. In what capacity? Later, an older cop says, “Us cops, we’ve got to protect each other,” before the trailer cuts to Jason shooting at a moving car.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This leads on to a theory that GTA 6 may feature a third playable character that Rockstar is keeping secret so it’s a surprise to fans, and that this older cop may be it. Could you shift perspective to a cop hunting down Jason and Lucia during the story?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now, this is a brilliantly silly fan theory: previous GTA games are <em>films</em> in the world of GTA 6. Phil Cassidy, the arms dealer from Vice City and GTA 3, is at the heart of this theory. In those games he’s missing an arm, but there is a character seen on Jason’s TV during the GTA 6 trailer that looks a lot like Cassidy — except he has both arms.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So, what’s happening here? If this is indeed Cassidy, then how does he have both arms? Could the GTA 6 Cassidy be Phil Cassidy’s son? Or his grandson?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Adding to the confusion is GTA's seperated universes structure. The GTA series is divided into three distinct parallel universes, officially named by Rockstar North as the "2D Universe", "3D Universe," and the "HD Universe."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The 2D Universe includes the original top-down GTA games developed by DMA Design. The 3D Universe starts with GTA 3 and includes its prequels, such as Vice City. And the HD Universe starts with GTA 4 and includes GTA 5, GTA Online, and the upcoming GTA 6, with each game set in the same year it was released. Following this, GTA 6 will be set in 2026, aka the modern day.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now, while these are meant to be distinct parallel universes, there is a lot of crossover between them, with shared place names, characters, some lore, and more besides. But certainly no-one was expecting Phil Cassidy from Vice City to pop up in GTA 6, as it makes the 'distinct parallel universes' thing even trickier.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So, perhaps having GTA’s 3D Universe games as films in the ongoing HD Universe would help resolve these issues. We do see what looks like Phil Cassidy on Jason's TV, after all. Or, this Phil Cassidy has nothing more than a fun Easter egg Rockstar added to GTA 6 to spark exactly this kind of speculation. This is Rockstar, after all!</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Trailer 2 has also reinforced existing theories that GTA 6 will feature heists, and that there is a heavy influence from the Fast &amp; Furious movies. At one point we see a truck with a vault attached to it, similar to the Fast 5 scene that does pretty much the same thing.</p><blockquote data-theme="light">— Marvrassiczilla 🅰️🦖🦎🦍 (@Movie__Fans) <a href="https://twitter.com/Movie__Fans/status/1919772545617952866?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">May 6, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">More GTA 6 fan theories are popping up all the time as people dig into Trailer 2. Expect plenty more in the year we have to wait until GTA 6 comes out.</p><div id="every-rockstar-game-tier-list" data-cy="tierlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Every Rockstar Game Tier List</h3><h3>Every Rockstar Game Tier List</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

                <p>With Nintendo announcing <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/did-nintendo-justify-mario-kart-worlds-80-price/1100-6530956/">Mario Kart World as an $80 launch game</a> for the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-preorder-guide-mario-kart-world-bundle/1100-6530531/">Switch 2</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-consoles-games-and-accessories-see-price-increases-starting-today/1100-6531257/">Microsoft also confirming</a> that its first-party titles will be sold at the same price, it looks like gaming is about to get a lot more expensive. Similarly to how base video game prices increased from $60 to $70 starting in 2020, other publishers will likely start to charge more for their products, but EA isn't currently planning to join this trend.</p><p>During a Q&amp;A session of its Q4 and FY2025 earnings conference call, EA was asked whether it would adopt a similar approach to other companies and adjust its "pricing power" for key IP in the future. "Our business is very different today than it was even just 10 years ago," EA CEO Andrew Wilson explained.</p><p>"In a world where everything we did 10 years ago was about selling shiny discs in plastic boxes in retail shelves, well that's still a part of our business. It's a significantly smaller part of our business, and we now have pricing representing everything from free-to-play all the way to deluxe editions and beyond. At the end of the day, whether we’re doing something that costs a dollar, or we're doing something that costs $10, or we're doing something that costs $100, our objective is always delivering incredible quality and exponential value to our player base. And what we've discovered over the course of time is whether we can marry quality and value together, our business is strong, resilient and continues to grow."</p><p>"From a games perspective, we have reflected no changes in our current strategy at this point," EA CFO Stuart Canfield added. It's worth noting that EA makes a <em>lot </em>of money from microtransactions. EA recorded $5.34 billion in this department in its 2025 financial year, and in comparison, video game sales brought in $2 billion in sales.</p><p>These comments come on the back of EA's publication of its fourth-quarter results for the three months ending on March 31, 2025. Wilson said that the company "significantly exceeded expectations" thanks primarily to games like EA Sports FC in Q4, The Sims, and Split Fiction. Live-service revenue also increased by 1% to $1.42 billion during this quarter, The Sims experienced the best growth in the history of the franchise, and total Split Fiction sales are nearly double what EA expected from the Hazelight Studios-developed game.</p><p>At the same time, it hasn't been smooth sailing at EA, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/apex-legends-studio-cancels-two-incubation-projects-lays-off-staff-amid-big-ea-shakeup/1100-6531200/">as hundreds of workers were laid off</a> and two "early-stage" incubation projects at Respawn Interactive were canceled.</p>

                <p>If you've ever played <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/destiny-2/" data-ref-id="5000-463450">Destiny 2</a>, you'll be familiar with the creeping overwhelm that can happen when returning to the game after a while, or if it's your first time playing. There are a lot of menu options, quests, triumphs, challenges, and more all housed within a complicated UI that many people seem to struggle to navigate easily. I recently returned to the game after a three-month hiatus and found myself blindly clicking to find the menus I needed--and that's as someone with more than 3,000 hours in the game.</p><p>During a reveal stream for the new expansion, The Edge of Fate, Bungie also outlined many quality-of-life upgrades and updates coming to the game. The most notable of these is a complete overhaul to the game's UI, which is now known as the Portal.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4489858-destiny2_theedgeoffaterevealevent56-46screenshot.png" data-ref-id="1300-4489858" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4489858-destiny2_theedgeoffaterevealevent56-46screenshot.png" data-ref-id="1300-4489858"></a><figcaption>The new Portal in Destiny 2</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4489858-destiny2_theedgeoffaterevealevent56-46screenshot.png"></figure><p>The Portal is a streamlined activity-selection screen, instantly showing the activities available at that time. There are different subsections within the Portal depending on the type of activity you want to play. These are split into Fireteam, Pinnacle, Crucible, and Solo Ops sections. Solo Ops is a new category that splits off smaller, shorter, self-contained gameplay sessions for those who want to play without the need for a fireteam.</p><p>You can also tailor the activities on offer depending on the rewards you're seeking. There are 50 new gameplay modifiers, which allow for the most customization in Destiny 2 so far. Activity rotations are now curated to provide variety and something new.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4489859-destiny2_theedgeoffaterevealevent59-36screenshot.png" data-ref-id="1300-4489859" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4489859-destiny2_theedgeoffaterevealevent59-36screenshot.png" data-ref-id="1300-4489859"></a><figcaption>The Portal splits subsections into clear activities</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1850/18507742/4489859-destiny2_theedgeoffaterevealevent59-36screenshot.png"></figure><p>From looking at the improved UI and the introduction of the Portal, it's already clear that Bungie may have fixed the most frustrating problem with its space shooter to date. As an avid Destiny 2 fan I've found myself trying to convince my friends to jump in, but with a complex New Light experience that dumps new players into the game with little direction other than suggesting to follow a marker for a bit to see what happens, they were reluctant, to say the least.</p><p>Now, with the Portal, the next logical activity is highlighted in the bottom right of the interface, whether that's a new campaign mission, or the next activity you need in order to complete a specific quest or triumph.</p><p>The Portal will be added with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-the-edge-of-fate-expansion-release-date-revealed/1100-6531335/" data-ref-id="1100-6531335">The Edge of Fate release date</a>, which also introduces new Destiny 2 armor systems, weapons, and locations. The first of those new locations, Kepler, will feature <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-will-have-customizable-location-difficulty-with-next-expansion/1100-6531337/" data-ref-id="1100-6531337">customizable difficulty</a> options, further deepening your ability to play the game exactly as you'd like.</p>

			<p>Grand Theft Auto VI is going to massively surpass its predecessor in pretty much every area, judging from a new early comparison video.</p>
<p>The new video, shared on YouTube by<a href="https://www.youtube.com/@grizzlybear1"> GRIZZLY BEAR</a>, is based on the game's second trailer shared online yesterday and does an excellent job highlighting the massive jump the new entry in the series will offer in terms of character detail, environments, visuals, and even special effects like explosions. You can check out the comparison right below.</p>
<p><iframe title="GTA 6 VS GTA 5 GRAPHICS AND DETAILS COMPARISON" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3ih0mVAGQfc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Following the&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-gets-surprise-second-trailer-as-rockstar-shares-first-info-and-many-gorgeous-images/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">surprise release of the game's second trailer</a>, Rockstar Games also launched the official Grand Theft Auto VI website, which provided some additional information on the two main characters, Lucia and Jason, and the new rendition of the iconic Vice City, which is said to offer something different in each neighborhood. Besides Vice City, players will also be able to explore a few other locations, like the tropical archipelago of Leonida Keys, the coast of Port Gellhorn, the industrial area of Ambrosia, and others.</p>
<p>Long scheduled for a Fall 2025 launch on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X and S, Grand Theft Auto VI was officially delayed last week, and will now release on <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-launches-may-26/">May 26th, 2026</a>, worldwide. The game was<a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-reportedly-had-no-chance-of-releasing-in-2025-for-months-due-in-part-to-a-real-desire-to-avoid-crunch/"> unsurprisingly</a> delayed to allow the developer to deliver the quality fans expect to see in the highly anticipated game.</p>

<p>This puts CD Projekt in the relative minority, as many other third party studios are instead favouring 'key cards' for their own Switch 2 releases. These key cards don't actually contain game data, and instead trigger a download from the Nintendo eShop when they are popped into the device.</p>

<p>But while there has been a general lean towards digital media over the past few years, CD Projekt says it has used its learnings from releasing <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-witcher-3-wild-hunt">The Witcher 3</a> on the original Switch when deciding upon a physical Switch 2 release for Cyberpunk 2077.</p>
<p>Having Cyberpunk 2077 as a "cartridge with a plug and play experience" on Switch 2 was "the right thing to do",   CD Projekt's VP of business development Jan Rosner told <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/cd-projekt-nintendos-audience-is">The Game Business</a>. The exec noted the original Switch's internal storage was "way lower than it is now", and a "game like The Witcher 3 would take up to 80 percent of your internal memory if you don't have an external memory card".</p>
<p>Nintendo players "are quite receptive" to that "plug and play experience", Rosner furthered, and so CDPR knew having a physical cartridge version of Cyberpunk 2077 for Switch 2 with no download required was "a goal that we wanted to achieve" from early on.</p>
<p>"Nintendo at physical retail is still strong, and retail is, in general, not going anywhere," he said, adding he doesn't see "a reality where we're just having all games digital" for a while yet.</p>
<p>"It's especially important for the Nintendo audience," the exec continued. "We maybe could have got away with [a key card], but is there a point? The right thing to do was to have it out on the cartridge with a plug and play experience."</p>
<p>Rosner advises other studios to "not underestimate the physical edition", saying this form of media is "not going anywhere and Nintendo players are very appreciative of physical editions that are done right".</p>

</figure>
<p>In the same conversation, Rosner said he believes that we will see "more and more third-party titles on the [Switch 2], which we may not necessarily expect" on the original Switch.</p>
<p>"The previous generation has proven to be so successful, and there [are] so many more players to be reached with that, and I think that the [console's capabilities] will surely allow it," he said.</p>
<p>This seems like a more than reasonable assumption. After all, along with Cyberpunk 2077, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/split-fiction-is-a-switch-2-launch-title">Hazelight's Split Fiction will also be a Switch 2 launch title</a>. Other third party titles also confirmed for the platform include <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-is-coming-to-switch-2">Elden Ring</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-7-remake-is-coming-to-switch-2">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/iois-james-bond-game-confirmed-for-switch-2">IOI's James Bond game</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-7-remake-is-coming-to-switch-2">Final Fantasy 7 Remake Intergrade</a>, although these won't be <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-release-date">available on the console's release</a>.</p>
<p>So, with all that said and done, does it seem likely we will also see a Switch 2 version of The Witcher 3 further down the line? Well, the studio is skirting that question for now and earlier this year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/will-the-witcher-3-get-a-switch-2-upgrade-cd-projekt-skirts-issue-for-now-as-its-all-in-on-cyberpunk-2077">CD Projekt told Eurogamer it is "all in on Cyberpunk 2077: Ultimate Edition" on Switch 2</a>.</p>
<p>"Our relationship with Nintendo goes back to the original Nintendo Switch, where we released The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt. We were happy with how that game was received by players so, when we heard about the more powerful Nintendo Switch 2, we immediately thought it would be the perfect platform for Cyberpunk 2077," CD Projekt's gameplay technical design expert Filip Downar told Eurogamer, adding that the studio was "thrilled" to be working with Nintendo again.</p>

The former is paid content while the latter will be available to all players.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">First up is Rite of the Nine, a "fresh take on dungeon diving for both seasoned dungeon crawlers and those stepping into the depths for the first time" that is already available to all players for no additional cost. While the dungeons themselves — Prophecy, Spire of the Watcher, and Ghosts of the Deep — will be familiar to some, even the most hardened Guardian can expect "unique twists" in which you'll reconnect with Orin and refreshed dungeon weapons.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Then, on July 15, we'll get the brand-new expansion, Destiny 2: The Edge of Fate, a "multiyear saga that will unfold across multiple expansions." A paid-for expansion, The Edge of Fate will reintroduce us to the Nine, powerful and mysterious beings who existed long before the Traveler, as two characters "step into the spotlight" — new ally Lodi and Warlock Vanguard, Ikora.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The expansion will take place on new destination Kepler, described as "inspired by the puzzle-solving and pathfinding challenges of Destiny 2’s dungeons and destination design which encourages deep exploration, mystery, and player-driven discovery." Expect new enemies, weapons, gear, and "destination-specific abilities."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">At the same time, on July 15, "major core game innovations" will roll out, including revised armor and gear systems "to create richer opportunities for buildcrafting" and a new activity selection screen called the Portal.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Players will be able to easily choose between Fireteam Ops, Pinnacle Ops, Crucible Ops, and the newly introduced Solo Ops," Bungie explained. "Fireteam Ops and Pinnacle Ops reinforce quick fireteam action and longer-form cooperative content, while the new Solo Ops activities are specifically designed for solo players who want short, self-contained gameplay sessions without the need for a fireteam.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Additionally, players can tailor activities to match their desired gameplay and the specific rewards they are chasing. 50 all-new modifiers will allow deeper gameplay customization and offer greater challenges for players, while curated activity rotations will ensure there is always something new to chase."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As typically happens with a new expansion, pre-order sweeteners are available, including an instantly unlockable Exotic Ghost and Legendary Emblem.

            <p>EA won't be raising the price of its games, as the company aims to "deliver incredible quality and exponential value for our playerbase".</p>
<p>During the company's latest earnings call, EA CEO Andrew Wilson responded to a question on whether it would be following the likes of Nintendo and Xbox in raising the price of its new releases this year.</p>
<p>Wilson noted how the "pricing power" of the business is very different today than a decade ago, with physical releases a "significantly smaller" part of the business and a range of price points from free-to-play to deluxe editions "and beyond".</p>

<p>"At the end of the day whether we're doing something that costs a dollar or we're doing something that costs $10 or we're doing something that costs $100, our objective is always to deliver incredible quality and exponential value for our playerbase," said Wilson. "And what we've discovered over the course of time is whether we can marry quality and value together, our business is strong, resilient and continues to grow."</p>
<p>EA CFO Stuart Canfield surmised the company has "no changes in the current strategy at this point".</p>
<p>The company's latest financial report states EA's net bookings for the last financial year totaled $7.355bn. It's essentially flat, with FY24 totalling $7.43bn and FY23 totalling $7.34bn, evidence of the resilience Wilson spoke of.</p>
<p>Interestingly, live services represented 73 percent of total net bookings for the latest financial year. Further, EA's American Football franchise exceeded expectations by reaching over a billion in net bookings, helping EA Sports to its biggest net bookings year ever.</p>
<p>The Sims also had "double digital growth" in the most recent quarter, while <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-praises-split-fiction-hugely-successful-launch-as-game-passes-another-sales-milestone">Split Fiction has now sold almost 4m units</a> since its release in March.</p>
<p>In short, the company is doing very well. And with the continued success of its annual sports games and high revenue generated from live service games, there's clearly no need to raise the price of its games just yet.</p>
<p>Speaking to wider economic factors, Wilson said: "Even in a world where we may not be immune from a meaningful macro-economic downturn, we do believe that we will be resilient and we do believe that we can grow over the course of time through that."</p>
<p>Nintendo has been criticised by fans for raising the price of its games with <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-nintendo-direct-everything-announced">Switch 2</a>, as its flagship launch game <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> will cost £75/$80. The company has since <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-responds-to-mario-kart-world-bumper-7580-cost">stated this is not a new "benchmark"</a> but an example of "variable pricing".</p>
<p>Microsoft, meanwhile, has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/confirmed-xbox-console-prices-are-going-up-worldwide">raised the price of its Xbox consoles</a>, with some new games rising to $80 by the end of the year.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

</div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Sponge away the dross and ephemera of my life and you're left with a series of moments in which I wonder: is <em>now</em> the right time to get into <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/video-game-franchises/the-legend-of-heroes">Legend of Heroes</a>? I've been planning to play Nihon Falcom's 17-part <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> series ever since a respected peer gently suggested that my enthusiasm for Final Fantasy and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dragon-quest">Dragon Quest</a> marked me out as a Basic Bitch, and that if I ever want to experience a <em>real</em> role-playing game, I should give LoH a go.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
I am held back by a number of things: 1) the Legend Of Heroes games are mega-normous, possibly 2) because they're meandering and overstuffed, for all their quality, and 3) nobody I've spoken to can agree on which I should start with. I did have a breakthrough recently, coming to the conclusion that I should get the ball rolling with The Legend Of Heroes: Trails In The Sky, the sixth game from 2004 - it's the one I see most often in GOAT threads, and the first in a distinct subseries. But now Nihon Falcom have ruined everything by plotting to remake it. Titled <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/trails-in-the-sky-1st-chapter">Trails In The Sky 1st Chapter</a>, the remake will launch on 19th September (as revealed in Famitsu, via <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2025/05/trails-in-the-sky-1st-chapter-launches-september-19">Gematsu</a>). Here's the most recent trailer.

<p>
If you're familiar with Trails In The Sky, the key differences here are: new HD visuals, new voiceovers, and "the choice of traditional turn-based combat or all-new, real-time action combat", as per <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3375780/Trails_in_the_Sky_1st_Chapter/">the Steam page</a>. Great: not only do I now have to decide whether to play the original game or the remake first, I also now have to pick between old and new flavours of battling. Why do you vex me, Nihon Falcom.
</p>
<p>
The one thing I consistently hear about the Trails games is that the NPC and world writing are absolutely excellent: generous to the point of exhausting, with every NPC worth returning to. If you've played it, please do not leave a comment expounding upon these or any other virtues. It will only add to my choice paralysis. I've read that anger freezes into depression if left unexpressed. Is there a point where FOMO metamorphs into a full-on midlife crisis?

            <p>
One of the programmers behind the very first <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/grand-theft-auto">Grand Theft Auto</a> has praised Rockstar for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/grand-theft-auto-6-gets-a-second-trailer-but-theres-still-no-date-for-a-pc-version">delaying </a><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gta-6-everything-we-know">GTA 6</a>'s initial release to May next year, observing (not in so many words) that the developers could have rushed out an early release consisting of a city's worth of T-posing NPCs and whitebox freeways, and people would still have paid top dollar for the game. 
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
Posting on social media, DMA Design founder (and former Lemmings developer) Mike Dailly also suggested that the Miami-based <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-open-world-games">open world game</a>'s latest trailer is a bump in animation quality over the announcement video from 2023. I know, I know: video game looks better as it gets closer to release - more at eleven. Still, I have a certain amount of nerdy interest in how, exactly, GTA 6's animations may have come along.</p>
<p>Let's rattle through those trailers again. Here's the one from 2023.
</p>

<p>
Dailly had this to say on <a href="https://x.com/mdf200/status/1731946221030252614">Xitter</a> of the announcement trailer. "Looks pretty, but the animations...bloody hell guys. Can't you animate things properly? No one moves like that!" Ooft, paging the burn ward! Flash forward to this month, and Dailly's open-ended concerns appear to have been addressed by the second trailer, below. 
</p>

<p>
"Now that's more like it," Dailly wrote on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/mdf200.bsky.social/post/3loj2dmckgs2v">Bluesky</a> yesterday. "That environment is lovely, and things are moving much better... Even if they'd released it broken, it'd still have sold hugely. So it's even more impressive they took the decision to delay it."
</p>
<p>
I am not a computer wizard equipped to conjure sweaty screenfuls of buttock from the sexless insides of a PS5 using the power of maths, but I'll be honest, I don't see an enormous gulf between trailers, beyond the differing presentation and music choice.</p>
<p>Well, I think the bit in the first one where Lucia waves her arms around while standing up in the roofless car looks a bit... impressionistic, like she's trying to conduct an invisible orchestra. But come now, Mike, I don't think it's fair to body-shame an ex-con fresh out of jail because she looks a bit unsteady while sticking her arms out of a moving vehicle. She's trying to blow off some steam, Mike! Besides, perhaps there <em>is</em> an invisible orchestra in the game.</p>
<p>Here are some other arbitrary micro-comparisons: Trailer 1 has flappier bottoms. Trailer 2 has more impetuous playful shoving. Trailer 1 has more heartfelt soul brother handshakes. Trailer 2 has... no crocodiles. Perhaps that crocodile walk cycle can serve as a critical yardstick once GTA 6 releases on console next year (PC release date, as ever, to follow). In the meantime, I welcome your mealy-minded feats of frame analysis.

As spotted by <a href="https://videocardz.com/newz/asus-rog-ally-2-and-rog-ally-2-xbox-edition-gaming-handhelds-leaked">Videocardz</a>, this leak comes direct from the US FCC's official certification of the hardware, and appears to be our first look at Microsoft and Asus' "Project Kennan" handheld plans.

<p>
Microsoft is set to officially reveal Project Kennan in the coming months - the company's annual June showcase seems a fair bet - and detail more about the system. 
</p>
<p>
It remains to be seen how powerful the hardware's technical specs are, and to what extent it will be able to play the full Xbox back catalogue.

On the surface, however, the device looks somewhat similar to the Steam Deck and other existing handheld PC hardware. Analogue sticks sit at either side of a screen, with a D-pad on one side and ABXY face buttons on the other. The black-coloured model's small Xbox button can be seen on its upper left side.

</p>
<p>
But with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/confirmed-xbox-console-prices-are-going-up-worldwide">Xbox prices going up worldwide</a>, the big question is - how much will Project Kennan eventually cost?

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/hoyoverse-provides-details-regarding-genshin-impact-on-xbox/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Genshin Impact</a> developer HoYoverse (previously known as miHoYo) <a href="https://genshin.hoyoverse.com/en/news/detail/155805" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> that United States players will have to verify their age soon to continue playing the game. Here's the brief message shared with the community:</p>
<p><em>Dear Travelers，</em><br>
<em>We are required by law to age verify US player accounts. The age verification process will be rolled out to all US players by May 20th while login (if already have one) or account registration.</em><br>
<em>Please ensure to provide your age information by July 18th, 2025. Failure to verify will result in:</em><br>
<em>- Account suspension</em><br>
<em>- In-game friends and chat records will be deleted</em><br>
<em>- No further notifications post-suspension due to inaccessible account information as required by law</em><br>
<em>If the verification is not completed by July 20th, 2026, the personal information of your HoYoverse account will be deleted permanently.</em></p>
<p>This appears to be a direct consequence of a recent <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2025/01/genshin-impact-game-developer-will-be-banned-selling-lootboxes-teens-under-16-without-parental" target="_blank" rel="noopener">settlement with the US Federal Trade Commission (FTC)</a>, which had charged HoYoverse with deceiving minors into spending for their loot boxes. The Chinese developer was subsequently banned from selling them to users under 16 without a parent's express consent, paid a $20 million fine to the FTC, and was also subject to the following stipulations:</p>
<ul>
<li>Prohibited from selling loot boxes using virtual currency without providing an option for consumers to purchase them directly with real money;</li>
<li>Prohibited from misrepresenting loot box odds, prices and features;</li>
<li>Required to disclose loot box odds and exchange rates for multi-tiered virtual currency;</li>
<li>Required to delete any personal information previously collected from children under 13 unless they obtain parental consent to retain such data; and</li>
<li>Required to comply with COPPA, including its notice and consent requirements.</li>
</ul>
<p>Samuel Levine, Director of the FTC’s Bureau of Consumer Protection, said at the time:</p>
<p><em>Genshin Impact deceived children, teens, and other players into spending hundreds of dollars on prizes they stood little chance of winning. Companies that deploy these dark-pattern tactics will be held accountable if they deceive players, particularly kids and teens, about the true costs of in-game transactions.</em></p>
<p>The popular free-to-play action RPG <a href="https://genshin.hoyoverse.com/en/news/detail/155739" target="_blank" rel="noopener">is being updated today to patch 5.6</a>. Dubbed 'Paralogism', it features two new characters, the five-star support character Escoffier and the four-star DPS character Ifa. There is also a new Archon Quest, a new Story Quest, and a new Boss fight, among other additions to Genshin Impact.</p>

            <p>A new video with <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-guides-tips-tricks-9403">Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth</a> director Naoki Hamaguchi suggests the full <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-vii">FF7</a> remake series is heading to <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-nintendo-direct-everything-announced">Switch 2</a>.</p>
<p>At the reveal for Nintendo's new console, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a> announced <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-7-remake-is-coming-to-switch-2">Final Fantasy 7 Remake Intergrade would be released on Switch 2</a>, though there's no release date just yet. However, that's just the first part of the planned trilogy, with Rebirth (part two) already out on PS5 and PC.</p>
<p>The latest Creator's Voice video from Nintendo features Hamaguchi expressing his excitement at developing for a Nintendo console. But what's most interesting are his frequent references not just to <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-7-remake-review-a-faithful-remake-with-a-few-missteps-along-the-way">Final Fantasy 7 Remake</a>, but to the whole series.</p>

<p>Discussing the new console's technical specs, Hamaguchi states he felt "it would have enough power to run the Final Fantasy 7 remake series" he's creating. Later, he notes this is his first time creating a game for a Nintendo system, adding: "And the fact that it happens to be the Final Fantasy 7 remake series, considering the original game gave me the opportunity to pursue a career in the games industry, makes me feel like it was fate."</p>
<p>At the end of the video, Hamaguchi gives the closest comment yet to confirmation of the full trilogy coming to Switch 2: "And with the release of the Final Fantasy 7 remake series on Switch 2, it would make me very happy if two generations connect and share a bond over the characters."</p>
<p>Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth remains a console exclusive on PS5, but it would appear a port for the Switch 2 could well be in development. Finally, Queen's Blood on the go!</p>
<p>It begs the question though: what about Xbox? And further: what does this mean for part three? Will that also be a timed console exclusive on PlayStation, or can we expect a simultaneous release on other consoles too?</p>
<p>It's all part of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/square-enix-aggressively-pursuing-new-multiplatform-strategy-after-reports-ff7-rebirth-underperformed-on-playstation">Square Enix's multiplatform strategy</a> it began "aggressively pursuing" in 2024 after both <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/square-enix-admits-final-fantasy-7-rebirth-and-final-fantasy-16-profits-did-not-meet-expectations">Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth and Final Fantasy 16 failed to meet sales expectations</a>.</p>
<p>And while Final Fantasy 7 is the more popular, could Final Fantasy 16 also be released on Switch 2 in future?</p>
<p>As for part three of the Final Fantasy 7 remake series, series producer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-7-remake-part-3s-story-completed-producer-very-satisfied-as-development-continues-without-delay">Yoshinori Kitase confirmed at the start of the year its story has been completed</a>. However, it's still unknown when it will be released - and on which platforms.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/split-fiction">Split Fiction</a> publisher EA has praised the game's "hugely successful launch", as developer Hazelight celebrates another sales milestone.</p>
<p>As part of its <a href="https://ir.ea.com/press-releases/press-release-details/2025/Electronic-Arts-Reports-Q4-and-FY25-Results/default.aspx">report for the 2025 fiscal year</a>, EA said Split Fiction was a key part in leading the company to a "strong finish" alongside <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/ea-sports-fc-25">EA Sports FC 25</a>.</p>

<p>"Q4 marked a strong finish to FY25, with broad-based momentum across the portfolio positioning the business for accelerated growth," said EA CFO Stuart Canfield. "As we enter FY26, we remain focused on disciplined execution as we build toward a slate of groundbreaking upcoming releases."</p>
<p>Soon after EA released its report, Hazelight announced Split Fiction has now sold 4m copies since its debut earlier this year.</p>
<p>"So many of you have picked up Split Fiction already, it’s amazing…" the <a href="https://x.com/HazelightGames/status/1919852640189456892">studio wrote on social media</a>. "Seeing the fun you have with our game and the love you show for Mio, Zoe and each other warms our hearts here at Hazelight."</p>
<p>It also made a playful wink wink, nudge nudge remark about "so many hot dogs made", but I won't say any more about that right now... It really is a moment best experienced first hand (wink wink, nudge nudge).</p>
<figure>

<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Hazelight</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>In the first 48 hours of release, Split Fiction sold an impressive 1m units. By the end of its first week, the studio announced <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/split-fiction-passes-major-sales-milestone-in-just-48-hours">Split Fiction had sold another 1m units</a>.</p>
<p>Not simply content with these figures, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/split-fiction-has-broken-not-one-not-two-but-three-world-records">the game subsequently broke three world records</a>, becoming the most played local co-op video game on Steam, the most sold local co-op video game within 48 hours of release, and most sold local co-op video game within one week of release.</p>
<p>And, it doesn't seem likely Split Fiction will lose any moment any time soon. A film adaptation of Split Fiction is already in the works, with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sydney-sweeney-to-star-in-split-fiction-film-written-by-deadpool-wolverine-team">Sydney Sweeney set to both star and produce</a>. The upcoming film is being directed by Jon M Chu, whose previous works include last year's musical hit, Wicked.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/split-fiction-is-a-switch-2-launch-title">Split Fiction will be a Switch 2 launch title</a> when the console releases next month. So, we can pretty much guarantee that the game will sell even more pretty darn soon.</p>
<p>"Fantastic from start to finish, Split Fiction is one of the most inventive and joyful co-op games to date, and a testament to the power of human imagination," Katharine Castle wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/split-fiction-review">Eurogamer's Split Fiction review</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/05/07/kiborg-review/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>Imagine the most generic video game setting that you can. It’s sci-fi, of course, with an abundance of chrome-plated, neon-soaked, space prisons bursting with grotesque slobbering mutants, vicious cyborgs and pistol-toting, visor-wearing punks. It’s all big swords, big guns, and even bigger biceps. Envisage all of that in your mind and you will be seeing the world of Kiborg.</p>
<p><iframe title="KIBORG - Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8pPyCAro1gE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Kiborg is an old-school third person action brawler, a game ripped straight out of a bygone console era. Though, unlike the early noughties games it mimics, Kiborg exists within the most populous genre of the 2020s, a roguelike. You take on the role of Morgan Lee, a bald, burly, gloriously moustachioed amnesiac who is stuck in a SMASH TV-like game show. You fight your way trough a vast prison, your gory exploits broadcast to the violence loving audience, in an attempt to reach the shuttle on the roof and your freedom.</p>


<p>Of course, this being a roguelite, you’ll die numerous times in the process, starting from the beginning of the game again, but this time you are slightly more powerful thanks to spending your hard-earned collectables on some permanent upgrades.</p>


<p>Borrowing from the classic Arkham Asylum combat style, Kiborg is a surprisingly punishing and gruelling roguelike, thanks to having far too many enemies who will gladly wipe out most of your health bar with just one hit. Matters aren’t helped by an obtuse parrying system, one with input timing that never really clicks. Sometimes you’ll counter like a master, other times you’ll get obliterated, even though you’re convinced you are tapping the right button at the correct time. In the mindless third person punch ‘em ups that Kiborg apes such inconsistencies didn’t matter, but in a roguelite, controller precision is everything, and Kiborg is far too rough around the edges in this regard.</p>
<p>Take dodging, which rarely sends Morgan in the direction you want him to go, resulting in a hefty health bar deduction as the usual punishment, particularly if you’re trying to escape an area attack. Gun play is dodgy too, quick firing often auto-aiming at the wrong target, resulting in a waste of the very limited ammunition you possess. Then there’s the combos, which thanks to the inconsistent input timings usually result in Morgan doing something you didn’t expect, so you just stick to the far more effective three-punch combo and spin kick to see you through.</p>
<p>If the difficulty wasn’t so grindy, these issues could be forgiven. But having to trudge through the cheap first-level boss and repetitive enemy types and samey environments again and again to make any progress soon gets tedious.</p>

<p>Yet, there is some old-school charm to be found here. The cybernetic implants you collect on every run are fun, each one radically changing Morgan’s appearance, bestowing him with a robotic head, a cyber-heart, or blades for hands. You can even summon allies to help to take off some of the pressure – even if your intimidating spiked wheel minion thingy gets stuck on the scenery all the time, the big hammer-totting goon is a lifesaver.&nbsp;Character builds are varied because of this, resulting in some hilariously over-the-top special attacks that resemble something straight out of the WWE.</p>
<p>The game’s reliance on its gunplay in later stages is frustrating, as this is by far the weakest aspect of its gameplay. Shooting rarely satisfies, resulting in a minor health bar reduction on most baddies, rather than sending them flying across across the room in a spray of gore as you would expect from the massive shotgun you are wielding. Bosses are walking difficulty-spikes and eminently frustrating, but levelling up Morgan until he can hack through an army of regular baddies in a visceral ballet of violence is undeniably thrilling.</p>
<p>Indeed, this is when the game is at its best, mindlessly punching your way through a room of foes. If only there was more of that, and less of the lacklustre roguelite elements, then Kiborg could have been a worthy contender for your time. Instead, this is likely only one for the curious.</p>
