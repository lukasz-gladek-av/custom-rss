            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/silent-hill-f-has-been-refused-classification-in-australia<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Automated RC rating is unlikely to be the end of the story, however.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Konami’s upcoming Silent Hill f has been refused classification in Australia, meaning the game would not be able to be sold within Australia at this time. However, Silent Hill f’s RC rating has been assigned by an automated rating tool and not via actual Australian Classification Board members so, based on precedent, it’s unlikely this is the end of the story.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Konami does not distribute its own games locally in Australia, but IGN has contacted its third-party distribution partner for comment.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The specific reason for Silent Hill f’s RC rating has not been supplied at this time. Since the introduction of an adults-only category for games in Australia (R18+) in January 2013, games that have been refused classification in Australia are only typically flagged for sexual activity with a person who appears to a child under 18, visual depictions of sexual violence, or tying incentives and rewards to drug use. 2008’s Silent Hill: Homecoming was initially refused classification in Australia in the lead up to its release due to a high impact torture scene but that was several years prior to the introduction of the R18+ rating, which now accommodates high impact levels of violence. Silent Hill: Homecoming was later released in Australia with altered camera angles for the problem scene, rated MA15+.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">What we already know, however, is that Silent Hill f’s RC rating in Australia has actually been assigned by an online tool maintained by the International Age Rating Coalition – which is a classification system designed for mobile and digitally delivered games. The IARC classification tool is an online questionnaire where applicants simply answer a series of questions about a game’s content. The IARC tool will subsequently assign an automated rating from each territory based on the classification standards from each participating country. In Australia's case, the IARC tool then sends the decision to be published automatically on <a href="https://www.classification.gov.au/titles/silent-hill-f" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Australia’s National Classification Database.</a></p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/03/24/iarc-1742775870177.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">In Australia, the tool can only be used for digitally-distributed games (it was <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2014/08/29/major-australian-classification-amendment-passes-senate"><u>adopted in 2014</u></a> due to the fact that, while the Australian Classification Board was rating an average of 755 games per year, over 40,000 games were being released annually on the iOS app store alone at that time). There have been <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/08/22/no-kingdom-come-deliverance-we-happy-few-are-not-banned-in-australia"><u>a number of instances where automated IARC ratings have demonstrated a tendency to trend higher than human ratings</u></a> from the Classification Board. For example, in 2019 Kingdom Come: Deliverance and We Happy Few were widely reported to have suddenly been banned in Australia when they had not.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The IARC tool is free to use, which particularly benefits small publishers and developers. Importantly, all physical releases are still required to be rated by the Classification Board itself so, if Silent Hill f is planning to have a physical release in Australia, a submission to the Classification Board was always going to be mandatory, anyhow. The Classification Board itself can override any classification given by the IARC tool if it disagrees with it. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">In Australia, game publishers can either have staff members who are accredited classifiers or authorised assessors. Accredited classifiers are in-house staff who complete training from the Classification Board and can classify games themselves, and their decision will take effect as an official Classification Board decision. Authorised assessors are staff or contractors who have similar training, but their classification decision is limited to a recommendation made to the Australian Classification Board, which must then decide whether to apply it or not.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For now, it’s too early to say whether Silent Hill f’s RC rating in Australia will be upheld after further actions or not. It is, however, the first Silent Hill game to get <u>an 18+ rating certification in Japan</u>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Luke is a Senior Editor on the IGN reviews team.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://remapradio.com/articles/new-system-old-me/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		<p>I spent a good portion of last weekend breaking in a new gaming PC that I ordered the day Nvidia 50XX series cards were listed. It was a new calendar year, so it was at least justifiable as a business expense. I also figured that, if we were rocketing towards a major global recession <em>and </em>authoritarianism in the United States, I’d at least have gotten a nice PC before everything went to hell.</p><p>I have found this less comforting than I imagined.&nbsp;</p><p>Nevertheless, on Saturday morning I was unboxing a new PC and slowly logging back into every gaming service under the sun. With each new game library I added, I scanned the list of games looking for the ones I was most eager to try-out with new hardware.</p><p>This ritual used to mean more: in the breakneck pace of video card development in the late 90s and early 2000s, a new card meant that every game from the last three years might be utterly transformed. The game that barely ran at 640x480 a couple years ago was now running with silky-smooth framerates at a godlike 1024x768. Who could ever need more? Except of course there was always this year’s new hotness, mocking your upgrades. Because in the time it took you to save up for and install a new graphics card, a new wave of cards was about to come out and developers were targeting<em> those </em>specs instead.&nbsp;</p><p>That “keeping up with the Joneses” quality of PC gaming was frustrating, but was also responsible for one of my favorite aspects of the hobby: with every upgrade, you kind of re-gifted old games to yourself. This Digital Foundry <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=87tvXIIMJes&amp;ref=remapradio.com"><u>video on <em>MechWarrior 2</em></u></a><em> </em>does a great job of showing just how radically a game might change within the span of a few years, via new editions for different video cards or later “complete / collector” releases that rolled together expansions and a slew of updates. The <em>MechWarrior 2 </em>I played in 1995 looked and felt completely different than the version for ATI cards I was playing a year later, which was again different from the version of <em>Mercenaries </em>I was playing in 1997. What did the sky look like in <em>MechWarrior 2</em>? Well, it depends on what you played it on.</p><p>That doesn’t happen anymore. Performance gains are far more marginal and improvements in graphics technology and techniques are more subtle. You can give yourself eye strain trying to spot the difference between “high” and “ultra” graphics on a lot of newer releases, and the fancy upscaling that does such a good job of stabilizing framerates also means that it’s harder to tell without benchmarks how well a game is actually running. Nowadays, the only place I can really feel the difference in hardware is when I turn on ray-tracing and see whether the result is beautiful but unplayable, beautiful but nauseatingly choppy, or beautiful and tolerable.</p><p>Nevertheless, I still perform the ritual. I load up games whose performance and visuals I know intimately, and that I’m always happy to return to even if they’re increasingly unable to challenge modern systems. And then there are always a few games I have saved for later, knowing they are made to be technical showcases.</p><p>These are my current benchmark games. For the most part, they're old standbys, the ones that make a new system feel like home and remind me what great artists can do with all the tech crammed into a PC case.</p><h3 id="total-war-three-kingdoms"><strong>Total War: Three Kingdoms</strong></h3><figure><div></div></figure><p>It’s really time to move on from this as a hardware trial, but this has been the first game I install on a new PC since it came out. Some other <em>Total War </em>games are harder to max out, but there are no recent ones I find as beautiful as this one and it’s easily the best strategy game Creative Assembly ever made. It couldn’t make a 4090 break a sweat on max settings, but I’ll be damned if I don’t love seeing huge armies crawling across&nbsp; those huge expanses of Han China, or zooming the camera into the fray under a canopy of falling leaves in an autumn rainstorm. </p><p>Does Zhang Fei hit any harder when he dashes into a line of soldiers like a meteor striking the earth when you’re easily hitting 120 FPS on a big-screen TV? No, but it <em>always </em>looks awesome and reminds me of why I got into tactics games.</p><figure><figcaption><span>When your new computer has already lost the mandate of heaven.</span></figcaption></figure><p>On the other hand, there <em>are</em> times an older games makes you start to wonder if the increasing number of tricks graphics cards are employing to eke out performance gains, and the scorching heat that modern systems generate, aren't going to wreak havoc with some older games. For instance, I have no idea why occasionally <em>Three Kingdoms </em>has a bunch of textures just come in as pure green pixels. But it doesn't seem good!</p>

<p>According to graphics uncovered by billbil-kun, pre-orderers will get The Last Crusade pack, which includes the travelling suit outfit and the lion tamer whip, while those who buy the premium edition will secure two days' early access to the DLC The Order of Giants, as well as a digital art book and the Temple of Doom outfit, on top of the pre-order bonuses. It seems the premium edition will be available as both a digital and physical version.</p> <div>

<p>Billbil-kun has also asserted that a game disc will be included in the physical version of the premium edition, although it seems "an internet connection will still be required to download the game and its content".</p>
<p>Challenged on their sources, Billbil said the information comes via "metadata".</p>
<p>"Smart, fun and so very Indiana Jones," Eurogamer's Katharine Castle <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-review">wrote in her five-star review of The Great Circle</a> last year, "[this] is a stealth action tour de force that marks a bold new era for MachineGames".

<p>Several builds of unreleased games have been uploaded to an undisclosed datamining discord server, including Riot Games’ 2XKO.</p>



<p>So far, Insider Gaming has been able to verify that early builds of the following games have been uploaded to the server:</p>



<ul>
<li>Killing Floor 3 </li>



<li><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/studios/riot-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Riot Games</a>‘ 2XKO</li>



<li>PLAYERUNKNOWN Prologue: Go Wayback</li>



<li>Embark Studios’ ARC Raiders </li>



<li>An early build of Delta Force Hawk Ops</li>
</ul>



<p>According to one source that’s in the server, uploads of the games builds are primarily used for datamining purposes, but some games with less protection will likely get leaked online. Either way, it looks like all of these games will have new bits of information leaked about them in the near future.</p>



<p>It’s currently unclear on where all of the builds originated, but according to other sources, 2XKO, PLAYERUNKNOWN Prologue: Go Wayback, and ARC Raiders have all recently been in a wider pool of playtesting.</p>



<p>Should any of the games leak, we will keep you updated.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/games/634123/balatro-localthunk-developer-anonymous-update<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p><em>Balatro</em> just won four Game Developers Choice Awards, including Game of the Year, but the person who made the game wasn’t on stage to accept them.</p><p>Instead, Playstack communications director Wout van Halderen spoke on behalf of <em>Balatro’s</em> developer, who goes by the alias LocalThunk, each time the game won an award. “The team does that to give LocalThunk the freedom to work in the style that he likes, which we respect,” Playstack marketing director Liz Cheng-Moore tells <em>The Verge</em>. “That’s our job,” van Halderen adds. </p><p>It’s an arrangement that the Playstack team figured out with LocalThunk ahead of other ceremonies like The Game Awards, where <em>Balatro</em> won three awards and was nominated for Game of the Year. LocalThunk didn’t want to be public, but he also didn’t want to be disrespectful to fans and the industry, so now the Playstack team accepts his awards on his behalf.</p><p><em>Balatro</em> was one of the biggest hits of 2024, launching after a series of popular demos to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24082252/balatro-review-poker-roguelike-videogame">wide acclaim</a>. Months after its initial launch, the game launched <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24256010/how-to-play-balatro-mobile-localthunk-playstack">on iOS and Android</a>, and as of January, it’s sold <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/21/24348727/balatro-5-million-copies-the-game-awards">more than 5 million copies</a>. </p><p>LocalThunk was at the Game Developers Conference this week meeting with other developers, but van Halderen and Cheng-Moore think he’ll generally remain anonymous to the public. It’s not that he wants to be <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/card-games/balatros-localthunk-isnt-trying-to-pull-a-banksy-he-just-wanted-to-be-left-alone-to-make-his-game/">the next Banksy,</a> Cheng-Moore says. He just prefers not to be in the spotlight.</p><p>His mysteriousness extends to how he communicates with the team and makes games. For example, Cheng-Moore tells me that <a href="https://localthunk.com/">his recent blog</a> was something that he talked about one day and launched the next. “It’s fully done by him,” Cheng-Moore says.</p><p>And with <em>Balatro</em>’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/7/24215342/balatro-free-major-gameplay-update-2025">upcoming gameplay update</a>, which is set to launch sometime this year, “I think he’s just going to surprise us one day and he’s going to say, ‘hey, here’s the 1.1 build,’” van Halderen says. “I think he works best with that freedom, because that’s how he made <em>Balatro</em> in the first place. He had no timelines, no stress. He could just tinker, and that’s how the magic happened.”</p><p>van Halderen adds that “I have not seen a single thing so far that he’s working on. And I kind of like it because I’ll be surprised as well.”</p><p><em><strong>Correction, March 23rd</strong>: Playstack’s communications director’s last name is van Halderen, not van Haldren. </em></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>The Entertainment Software Association (ESA) - the same organisation that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/e3-is-officially-dead">used to run E3 before it was cancelled</a> - has announced the Accessible Games Initiative, a cross-industry campaign to provide consumers with clear information about the accessibility features available in video games.</p>
<p>The five founding companies - EA, Google, Microsoft, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/nintendo-of-america">Nintendo of America</a>, and Ubisoft - have partnered with the ESA to "help provide clear information about whether a specific video game has accessibility features and, if so, what those features are". Amazon Games, Riot Games, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a>, and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/warner-bros-games">Warner Bros.

<p>The initiative is launching with a set of 24 tags - such as clear text, large and clear subtitles, narrated menus, stick inversion and save anytime - with "clear criteria about what each tag means", and "over time", the initiative expects participating companies to place the Accessible Games Initiative tags on digital storefronts, product pages or digital catalogues. The tags have reportedly been developed with guidance and feedback from disabled gamers, advocacy groups, and developers, "all of whom provided valuable insights about the real-world applications of the tags".</p>
<p>"The timeline for implementation of the tags will be determined on a company-by-company basis and is always voluntary," the ESA added, and as feedback is gathered from the community and new technologies and features are developed, it "expect[s] the existing tags to evolve and to introduce additional tags in the future".</p>
<p>"Tens of millions of Americans have a disability and often face barriers to experiencing the joy and connection that comes with playing video games," said Stanley Pierre-Louis, ESA president and CEO.</p>
<p>"We are immensely proud to announce the Accessible Games Initiative in partnership with industry leaders. This initiative demonstrates how impactful we can be when we work together in our industry-wide pursuit of helping more people experience the power of play."</p>

<p>In December, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rnib-introduces-toolkit-and-player-panel-to-help-devs-make-games-more-accessible-to-players-with-sight-loss">Royal National Institute of Blind People (RNIB) established a player testing panel for the video games industry</a>, research institutions, and academia called the Design for Every Gamer Player Panel.</p>
<p>Alongside its new Devkit: Best Practice in Accessible Gaming 2024, the organisation said that by engaging with this diverse group, "developers and researchers can gather essential feedback on accessibility, helping to ensure that their games and studies are inclusive and accessible to gamers with sight loss".</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Battlestate Games has pushed out a limited-time event in Escape from Tarkov, setting bosses to a 100% spawn rate for a single day. One of the biggest talking points coming out of this spontaneous change is that PvE players have once again missed out on the event, for reasons unknown.</p>



<p>Earlier this year, Battlestate Games’ Nikita Buyanov stressed that as a wipe progresses in Tarkov, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tarkov-pve-player-numbers-nikita/">around 50% of players</a> are locked in on the PvE platform. It comes as a surprise to learn that all those players are missing out on this latest Tarkov event.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-pushed-aside">Pushed Aside</h2>



<p>The newest <a href="https://x.com/tarkov/status/1903734472383590723" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Escape from Tarkov event</a> is a simple thing that allows boss characters to spawn on their respective maps with a rate of 100%. Every raid you enter is guaranteed to have a boss in it – unless you’re too late to reach them, of course.</p>



<p>However, fans are up in arms on social platforms because once again, Battlestate Games has neglected to loop in the PvE-based players for this event. This is far from being the first time this has happened, but this time around, it makes <strong>no sense</strong>.</p>



<p>Typically, PvE players miss out on pre-wipe events <strong>because their games won’t automatically reset</strong>, but this is a limited-time, one-off event that’s disconnected from any major update.</p>



<p>Fans are yet to determine <strong>why </strong>this Escape from Tarkov event has been pushed live, as it’s out of the blue and serves no purpose other than giving players a tighter challenge and helping them out with some ‘boss kill’ tasks.</p>



<p>Are you one of the many people playing PvE in Escape from Tarkov? Are you annoyed at missing this event? Let me know in the comments how you feel about it all.</p>

            <p>An entire playthrough of the PS3 version of Until Dawn played in first-person perspective has popped up online.</p>
<p>For those who don't already know, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-3-exclusive-until-dawn-exposes-its-horror-parody-roots">Until Dawn was initially conceived as a PS3 exclusive</a> that made use of PlayStation's Move controllers. While we knew it featured a first-person perspective with gameplay shifting between members of the group, this is the first time anyone's shared a full playthrough.</p>

<p>Uploaded to a channel called Digital Preservation, the game - seemingly an in-development prototype with placeholder voice work and some wonky visuals - runs for four hours and boasts some, if not quite all, of the cast we see in the PS4 version and includes sound effects, score, and many of the plot beats and environments we know from the final PS4 (and remake) version (thanks, <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2025/03/watch-a-full-playthrough-of-the-first-person-until-dawn-that-never-released">PushSquare</a>).</p>

<p>Ballistic Moon, which is based in the UK, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/until-dawn-remake-studio-ballistic-moon-lays-off-staff-ahead-of-the-games-release-in-october">confirmed a round of redundancies last year</a>, saying it had made the "tough decision to significantly scale down our team to secure the future of our studio." However, a new report now claims the studio quietly made a second round of redundancies toward the end of last year.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/silent-hill-f">Silent Hill f</a> has been refused classification in Australia.</p>
<p>The Department of Infrastructure, Transport, Regional Development, Communications, and the Arts' Classification Board (IARC) has not detailed why, exactly, the horror has been <a href="https://www.classification.gov.au/titles/silent-hill-f">denied release</a>, but simply invites people to contact the organisation if they want more information (so I have - I'll update as/when I hear back).</p>

<p>The Australian classification board is notoriously strict - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hunter-x-hunter-nen-x-impact-banned-in-austrailia-for-implied-sexual-violence">fighting game Hunter x Hunter Nen x Impact was banned back in December</a>; in a later statement, this was revealed to be due to implied sexual violence involving minors - and this isn't even the first Silent Hill game to be banned, as Homecoming's eye-watering "high impact" torture scene similarly saw it refused classification in 2008, too. A censored version was later released.</p>
<p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hotline-miami">Hotline Miami</a> 2, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/south-park-the-stick-of-truth">South Park: The Stick of Truth</a>, and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/saints-row-4">Saints Row 4</a> are among dozens of games to have been denied an Australian release, with many thought to have been banned due to sexual violence, drug use, or "sexual activity involving a person who is, or appears to be, a child under 18".</p>
<p>Silent Hill f was unveiled as part of Konami's four-game series revival back in 2022, but it took until the middle of March 2025 to get an update. Now that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/silent-hill-2-remake-review">Bloober Team's superb Silent Hill 2 Remake</a> is behind us, the publisher is turning its attention to its mysterious follow-up, a new mainline instalment set in 1960s Japan.</p>
<p>Silent Hill f is being developed by Neobards Entertainment (which has previously served as a support studio for Capcom's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/resident-evil-games-order">Resident Evil games</a>), with creature and character design by Kera, and a script by When They Cry writer Ryukishi07.</p>
<p>As Matt recently summarised for us, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/konamis-japan-set-silent-hill-f-resurfaces-with-eerie-new-trailer-and-fresh-details">Silent Hill f's events are unfolding in the rural town of Ebisugaoka</a> - based on Kanayama, Gero, in the Gifu Prefecture - where our protagonist Shimizu Hinako, an "ordinary teenager", finds her home shrouded in fog and changed in "horrific" ways. As Silent Hill f play out, she'll explore a town she no longer recognises, solving puzzles, fighting strange enemies, and eventually having to make a "beautiful yet terrifying" decision that lies at the heart of the game.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Recently, Mojang revealed the Vibrant Visuals update for Minecraft. It’s an evolution of the game’s 15-year-old visual palette, and it’s set to change how reflections, sunlight, water, draw distances, and more all behave in Minecraft. It’s set to alter the game’s overall appearance without changing too much, but when is Vibrant Visuals coming to Minecraft?</p>



<p>The Vibrant Visuals update is already exciting fans worldwide. It’s one of the most major updates to hit Minecraft for a while, and it’ll be added alongside various changes – such as the introduction of a <strong>happy ghast</strong>. Amazing.</p>



<p>Read on to learn when Vibrant Visuals is coming to Minecraft.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-minecraft-vibrant-visuals-release-date-status">Minecraft Vibrant Visuals Release Date Status</h2>



<p><strong>At the time of writing, the release date for Vibrant Visuals in Minecraft was pending, with Mojang having mentioned that it’s coming ‘in the future’.</strong> However, players on select Minecraft: Bedrock Edition devices using a beta or preview system will be able to test Vibrant Visuals sooner than that.</p>



<p>Minecraft Live 2025 had some solid reveals, but the Vibrant Visuals announcement was by far the best received. It’ll follow the Minecraft Spring to Life update, which is set to drop soon. Later this year, players will also get their first look at the dried ghast, which can be claimed and turned into a ghastling, and then into a <strong>happy ghast</strong>.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-vibrant-visuals">What is Vibrant Visuals?</h2>



<p>The Vibrant Visuals update was perfectly broken down in the <a href="https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/minecraft-vibrant-visuals" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Minecraft Live recap</a>, but I’ll paste the most important details about the update here.</p>



<p>Vibrant Visuals will change and introduce various key features in Minecraft:</p>



<ul>
<li>Shadows interacting with sunlight more accurately</li>



<li>Volumetric fog</li>



<li>Directional lighting upgrades</li>



<li>Infinite clouds across the draw</li>



<li>‘Thousands of individually crafted elements’</li>



<li>Accurate light rays through trees, windows, water, etc</li>



<li>Glow upgrades and evolved reflections</li>



<li>More accurate water visuals</li>
</ul>



<p>The team at Mojang was quick to point out that the Vibrant Visuals update in Minecraft won’t destroy the ‘creative principles’ of the game – it’s almost entirely a visual update.</p>



<p>If you’re eager to know, ‘When is Vibrant Visuals coming to Minecraft,’ you’ve got a little longer to wait, I’m afraid. It won’t be long, though – Mojang has announced it will be speeding up these ‘Game Drops’ in future, so you’ll know more very soon.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Minecraft is Getting ‘Vibrant Visuals’ and Happy Ghasts This Year]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/minecraft-happy-ghasts-vibrant-visuals/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/minecraft-is-getting-%E2%80%98vibrant-visuals%E2%80%99-and-happy-ghasts-this-year.1142403/</guid>

<p>In the latest Minecraft Live event, several key updates were revealed as coming to the block-building game soon, including ‘Vibrant Visuals’. This visual upgrade is an attempt from Mojang to upgrade the look of Minecraft without messing with ’15 years of design’. It’s set to redefine how the game looks, but the fundamentals won’t be adjusted too much.</p>



<p>Also, <strong>HAPPY GHASTS </strong>are en route to the Minecraft world. These adorable renditions of the creepy creature require a little work to obtain, but once you’ve got one, you can use it to fly around the map with reckless abandon.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-minecraft-game-drops-coming-soon">Minecraft Game Drops Coming Soon</h2>



<p><a href="https://www.minecraft.net/en-us/article/minecraft-live-2025-recap" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Mojang revealed</a> that smaller updates will come to Minecraft more regularly going forward, and they’re being dubbed ‘Game Drops’. Also, the annual schedule will now accommodate <strong>TWO </strong>Minecraft Live broadcasts.</p>



<p>First up this year is the Spring to Life update, landing on March 25. It’s set to change various mobs, equipping them with warm and cold variants, and new ambient features are being added, such as the glittering firefly bush and falling leaves.</p>



<p>Vibrant Visuals is next on the docket. This overhaul will transform the game’s appearance, with Mojang evolving and upgrading directional lighting, volumetric fog, reflections, and more. The sun will cast better shadows, water will have more clarity, clouds will have more 3D depth, and various surfaces will glow and reflect light more accurately.</p>



<p>Fans worldwide are super excited about the impending introduction of happy ghasts, too. Later in 2025, players will be able to head into the Nether and secure ‘dried ghasts’, which are sad creatures on their last legs. By bringing them back to the Overworld, they’ll be able to rehydrate it and have a happy, helpful ghastling on their hands.</p>



<p>Once you have generated a ghastling, it’ll mature into a happy ghast, which you can then use to fly around the Overworld with other players, using it to craft tall, otherwise out-of-reach structures in Survival.</p>



<p>Which of these updates are you most looking forward to? Let me know in the comments.</p>
