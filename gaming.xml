            <p>Ubisoft has had a rough year or more, losing almost half its share value in 2024 due to the underwhelming performance of Star Wars Outlaws and the delay of Assassin's Creed Shadows, among other issues. Now Tencent and Ubisoft's founders, the Guillemots, are considering buying out the publisher, reports say.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>A report <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/tencent-guillemot-family-said-consider-134712316.html">by Bloomberg</a> cited "people familiar with the matter," saying Tencent and Guillemot Brothers Ltd were considering their options. Both parties are currently minority shareholders of Ubisoft, with Tencent controlling around 9% of shares and the Guillemots owning around 20.5%. 
</p>
<p>Other minority shareholders have been <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/an-ubisoft-investor-wants-to-dethrone-ubisofts-founders-so-ubisoft-can-lay-more-developers-off">speaking out against the Guillemots' leadership of the company in recent months</a>, pushing for the board to "take Ubisoft private or allow it to sell to strategic investor". 
</p>
<p>Shareholders' frustrations had been growing for some time, but peaked following the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-to-2025-as-ubisoft-try-to-recover-from-softer-than-expected-star-wars-outlaws-launch">"softer than expected" performance of Star Wars Outlaws</a>. Ubisoft took the unusual decision in its wake to delay Assassin's Creed Shadows, their tentpole release in Q4, despite the game being ready to ship, in favour of adding new features and story quests designed to bolster its reception when it now launches next February.
</p>
<p>Ubisoft's shares rose around 33% in the wake of Bloomberg News' report of the buyout being considered.
</p>
<p>There has been recurring chatter about someone buying Ubisoft for years, whether private equity sniffing around in 2022, which is when <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tencent-are-working-in-concert-with-ubisofts-founding-family-after-300m-investment">Tencent got involved</a>, or long-running efforts by <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/vivendi-buying-ubisoft">Vivendi to take over the company</a> in the 2010s. Guillemot has previously maintained <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ubisoft-say-theyd-consider-being-bought-if-someone-offered">they'd consider selling if someone offered</a>; maybe now we'll see if other shareholders would consider selling to him.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://kotaku.com/silent-hill-2-remake-bloober-review-ps5-pc-horror-2024-1851665482<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I’ll admit that when it was first confirmed that Bloober Team was remaking <em>Silent Hill 2</em>, I laughed and shook my head. Bloober has a spotty track record with scary games, <em>Silent Hill 2</em> is one of the most beloved horror games ever made, and Konami has done a horrible job supporting the franchise over the last decade. So the idea of modern Konami ordering a <em>Silent Hill 2</em> remake from Bloober Team seemed like a recipe for a trainwreck. Once again, I assumed <em>Silent Hill</em> fans would be left disappointed and frustrated.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="192716" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Horror Game You've Never Heard Of Is Scientifically The Scariest Ever" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="174" data-playlist="192716,196013,196805" data-current="192716"><div><p>Horror Game You've Never Heard Of Is Scientifically The Scariest Ever</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/192716/192716_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/192716/192716_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/192716/192716_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/192716/192716_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/18169.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>But that’s not what happened. After playing about 11 hours of the remake I can confidently say that Bloober Team has created something special that even <em>Silent Hill 2 </em>newcomers will enjoy, assuming they love oppressive atmospheres, creepy monsters, and scary situations.</p><p>The <em>Silent Hill 2</em> remake tells the same story as the original PS2 classic. James Sunderland gets a letter from his supposedly dead wife and travels to Silent Hill, aka the worst town in America, to find her or at least find out what’s going on. Within minutes of arriving in the fog-filled town, James is fighting for his life against disturbing monsters while meeting bizarre people who have seemingly lost their minds. Or maybe James is slowly losing his mind?</p><p>Bloober Team’s remake of <em>Silent Hill 2</em> doesn’t look to shake up the plot or characters of the original too much, which is a smart move. Like most elements of the remake, <em>Silent Hill 2</em>'s narrative is faithful and respectful of the OG. Some might complain that at times Bloober Team is being <em>too </em>conservative with how strictly they adhere to the classic survival horror game and its characters, narrative, and world. Yet, I get it. <em>Silent Hill 2</em> is one of the genre’s most lauded games. If it ain’t broke, why fix it? And Bloober Team, rightfully so, doesn’t assume it can perfect or outsmart the original story and instead mostly recreates it with great care and higher production values.</p><p>All the unnerving dialogue, strange quirks, and oddball writing are still here, it just sounds better than ever and is delivered by photorealistic recreations of the characters who now exist in gorgeously lit and intricately detailed areas.</p><p><em>Silent Hill 2 </em>doesn’t just look different (and amazing), the remake also plays very differently than the original game. The camera is brought in closer to James and combat has been expanded and modernized a bit, with gameplay and a control scheme that feel closer to the recent <em>Resident Evil</em> remakes. It’s a smart move, as while<em> Silent Hill 2 </em>is a classic that people still talk about fondly in 2024, even its most diehard fans admit that its combat and controls feel clunky at times.</p><p>Oh, and if you were worried that Bloober Team might cut out all the esoteric and impossibly silly puzzles, don’t be concerned. All of that stuff is still here, just once again rendered at a higher resolution.</p><figure id="" data-id="dc860b45e1e77dc6e434ba5087ce99c8" data-recommend-id="image://dc860b45e1e77dc6e434ba5087ce99c8" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot shows Silent Hill 2 remake's photorealistic streets.

" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The <em>Silent Hill 2 </em>remake also effectively recreates the same oppressive and dreary atmosphere that so many horror fans love in the OG. Creeping around the foggy streets of the remake reminded me of when I first played the original <em>Silent Hill</em> on PS1. I was nervous about what would come out of the fog and the world felt dangerous at all times. When I entered buildings or visited the other side of the town in <em>Silent Hill 2</em>'s remake, I felt claustrophobic and scared. I would have to take breaks after playing for a bit so that I could let my heartbeat slow down and my eyes blink again.<br></p><p>I play a lot of scary games and it’s been a while since one has spooked me as much as <em>Silent Hill 2</em>. And it does so without constant jumpscares, either. Instead, it relies on an overwhelming sense of dread and makes you feel trapped in a nightmare. So yeah, the <em>Silent Hill 2</em> remake is very scary and will be a treat for fans of horror games.</p><p>Bloober Team has truly delivered on the assignment of updating and modernizing a classic horror game without changing what made it special. The question is: Did the world need a <em>Silent Hill 2 </em>remake? The original is still worth playing and fans have made it easier than ever to experience that classic game in 2024. So I’m not sure we <em>needed </em>a remake. But I’m at least happy to report that the remake we got is a genuinely well-made, faithful adaptation of the OG classic developed by people who seem to not only love<em> Silent Hill 2</em> but who also understand it and know when to tweak and when to stand back and let the original moments shine.</p><p>Remaking <em>Silent Hill 2 </em>always seemed like an impossible task, and I imagine it wasn’t easy, but Bloober Team has done it and in the process created one of the best scary games of 2024. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The downsizing cast doubt on the launch and support of both Zombie Army VR and Starship Troopers: Continuum, but in a statement issued to IGN, XR Games insisted both would still release later in 2024.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Here’s the statement, from Bobby Thandi, Founder and CEO of XR Games:</p><blockquote>“I’m heartbroken that we’re going to be losing some of our incredibly dedicated, talented and valued colleagues. We’ve spent many months carefully exploring alternative solutions in the face of a challenging VR gaming market and a tough broader gaming landscape, and this is one of the hardest business decisions we’ve faced.</blockquote><blockquote>“Our priority during and after this consultation process is to treat all team members with the utmost respect and care.

We also have mental health support available for our staff.</blockquote><blockquote>“I’m so very proud of our teams for their hard work on Hitman 3: VR Reloaded, which will continue to receive patch support, as well as Zombie Army VR and Starship Troopers: Continuum, both of which are due for launch this year. We want to be able to develop innovative titles for many years to come, and we’ll work to navigate this transition and shape the future of XR Games.”</blockquote><p>Hitman 3: VR Reloaded, developed by XR Games in partnership with Hitman owner IO Interactive, is a standalone port of Hitman VR for the Meta Quest 3 that was supposed to address some of the biggest criticisms of the PC game, like the lack of dual wielding. But it launched to negative reviews from players as well as press, with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/if-you-thought-hitman-3-vr-was-bad-on-pc-just-wait-until-you-see-hitman-3-vr-reloaded-in-action" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Eurogamer</a> calling it “about as grim as VR games can get.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>The VR market has struggled.

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/diablo-4-vessel-of-hatred-review</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/diablo-4-vessel-of-hatred-review.1000995/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/diablo-4-vessel-of-hatred-review<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section><p>Diablo 4 was one of my favorite games last year, so I’ve had high hopes for Vessel of Hatred, the first expansion to developer Blizzard’s demonic ARPG. Fortunately, this action-packed crusade through the muck and mire of Nahantu’s forests and swamps is exactly what the plague doctor ordered, even if there isn’t as much meat on the bones as I’d hoped. In fact, the truncated campaign, unfinished story, and modest amount of endgame content make this expansion feel more like a prologue in some ways. But the quality of life improvements, changes to the meta, debut raid activity, and fantastic new character class are all so dang good that I’m happy to continue grinding XP and claiming shiny loot for several hundred more hours.</p><p>Vessel of Hatred picks up right from the maddening cliffhanger the base campaign left us dangling at, with the Daughter of Hatred now dead and a young adventurer having spirited away a soulstone that contains one of heaven’s most wanted demons: Mephisto. Throughout this roughly six-hour story, you’ll watch the dominos fall as the manifestation of pure evil inches ever closer to what seems like an inevitable resurrection… but things wrap up well before reaching any kind of climax, leaving us with yet another cliffhanger (one it seems we’ll be stuck with for some time). That makes the campaign the weakest part of the expansion, and although the lore, characters, and few substantial plot developments we <em>do </em>get are all extremely compelling, there are simply too few of them with precious little payoff to boot.</p><p>Thankfully, the stuff you’re actually doing during and beyond what scraps of story we’re served up are as exhilarating as Diablo 4 has ever been. Just about everything – from the changes to leveling and the loot system, to the added dungeons and side quests – is beyond fantastic. Rune words, a returning feature that lets you put special enchantments on your equipment, adds yet another layer to buildcrafting that I adore, and smashing through the Kurast Undercity, a time-attack dungeon that’s infinitely replayable and great for farming endgame loot, easily devoured my evenings. Not every task hits the mark, like the seasonal Realmwalker activity that has you slowly follow around a big, dumb monster while you wait for him to reach his final destination before you can finally kill him, but hacking and slashing through the compelling Nahantu region of Sanctuary that’s been stapled onto the southern part of the map is rarely dull.</p><p>I especially enjoy the changes to the leveling system, which now caps out at 60 instead of 100, then gives you 300 levels of overleveling to invest in insanely complex paragon perk trees. The result of this shortened climb is that you get into the endgame much sooner, which will be very nice when making new characters each season. You get to spend more time engaging with endgame buildcrafting while creeping your way up higher world tier difficulties, earning and upgrading ever more powerful loot as you go. Whereas the previous Diablo 4 ladder-climbing journey had the occasional slow point, this streamlined version feels good all the way through to 300, and I am much more inclined to repeat that step on multiple characters and through multiple seasons as a result – something that’s likely to dramatically improve my long-term commitment to fighting off the hordes of hell.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Spiritborn has quickly become one of my favorite classes.</p></div><p>My favorite added mechanic is the mercenary system, which lets you recruit NPC heroes to join you on your adventures. This allows solo players to even the odds a bit with co-op groups by having a computer-controlled friend or two tag along on adventures, including Subo, the long-ranged bounty hunter who provides backup with his bow, and Aldkin, a demon child who uses her demonic powers to send your foes to the shadow realm. Not only do these faithful companions each have their own introductory quests where you learn about their history, but the longer you spend time with them, the more XP they’ll gain to unlock new abilities and other rewards. </p><p>But the most substantial new thing to dive into is the delightfully customizable character class: the Spiritborn. After spending nearly all of my time in the expansion as this class, it’s quickly become one of my favorites. This tribalistic magical warrior relies on their connection with guardian spirits, ghostly animals who imbue them with godlike power, all of which have their own memorable, unique style and set of strengths and weaknesses. The gorilla spirit is all about making you an invulnerable tank, then punishing your enemies for daring to attack you with thorns, while the wonderfully offensive jaguar will turn you into a lightning-fast, melee-swinging DPS machine (who is quite squishy). The eagle is all about mobility, and allows you to teleport around the map and make yourself incredibly hard to hit, while my personal favorite, the centipede, lets you cover large areas in poison and make yourself nigh invulnerable with life-stealing abilities. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Diablo 4: Vessel of Hatred Gameplay Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>The really cool part is, although you’re best off focusing on one or two spirits, you can mix and match any combination of the abilities each of the phantom beasts offers. So instead of having a specific set of things your class excels at, like berserking and bleed damage with the barbarian or crowd control and AoE damage with the sorcerer, you have a whole lot more options with the Spiritborn. This modularity is especially great when one build isn’t working out for you, because instead of switching to a different character, you can just respec your skills, swap out a few pieces of equipment, and instantly transform from a cautious tank into a belligerent glass cannon. Playing as the old classes still has plenty of advantages, like the fact that you can get way deeper into the weeds with those more focused playstyles, but for those who want a bit more freedom to change their mind and try different approaches, the Spiritborn is an absolute godsend.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Dark Citadel is one of the biggest highlights of Vessel of Hatred.</p></div><p>One of the biggest highlights of Vessel of Hatred is the new endgame co-op activity called Dark Citadel. This challenging gauntlet requires you and three friends to best devilish bosses while completing raid-like puzzle mechanics in three different wings of a deadly fortress, fighting off countless high-level enemies along the way. This is the first activity of its kind for the series and, while it definitely has all the signs of being an early attempt, is easily the best endgame activity Diablo has ever had. It makes Nightmare Dungeons and the Uber Lilith boss fight from the base game feel underwhelming by comparison. </p><p>Dividing our group between two realities and coordinating a way to take down a boss’ immunity shielding was some of the most fun I’ve had in Diablo 4, and reveling in the high-end loot made me want to run it all again. There’s plenty of room for improvement, though, as all the raid mechanics are so straightforward that our group was able to push through to the end with minimal coordination and no more than a few failed attempts at each wing. Still, it’s an extremely impressive first draft that I’m eager to see Blizzard build upon in future expansions, and it’s already without question the most fun activity to be found in an already excellent action-RPG.</p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><p><h3>TieGuyTravis' Favorite Isometric Action Games</h3></p></div><p>With such an exemplary co-op activity to delve into, it’s very nice to see Vessel of Hatred finally bring matchmaking functionality (called Party Finder) to Diablo, allowing you to easily find a group of fellow wanderers to smash through demons with. Like you’d expect, you’re able to post or search for groups that are playing on specific world tiers, tackling certain activities, who want to talk in a party chat, and all that bog standard goodness. For folks like me, who tend to run around Sanctuary solo unless given an activity that really requires co-op, this is a really neat feature that probably should have been available long ago, but which comes at a perfect time since Dark Citadel makes partying up more of a necessity.</p><p>A year and a half into its lifespan, it’s a bit surprising that Vessel of Hatred is the most unstable version of Diablo 4 so far. It’s nothing so bad it ever made me want to rage quit, but with multiple crashes, quests that wouldn’t complete, important NPCs multiplying and hilariously running around the map together, bosses becoming permanently invulnerable for no reason, and more, it was enough to occasionally throw a wet blanket over an otherwise good time. I’m sure many or all of these issues will be addressed in the weeks and months to come, but my time in Nahantu was a lot less polished than I’d anticipated. That said, not all bugs were too awful, like one where my friends and I were able to get exponentially more XP than we were supposed to and powered through 50 levels in a matter of minutes… that was actually pretty fun.</p></section><div data-cy="verdict"><h3>Verdict</h3><p>Diablo 4: Vessel of Hatred is an awesome expansion that adds an excellent new area to explore, a gloriously modular character class that I can’t stop playing, an impressive debut raid activity, and lots more. But while just about everything it adds is awesome, it definitely doesn’t do enough where the somewhat flaccid campaign and story is concerned, and numerous bugs can occasionally drag it down. Thankfully, the changes to the meta, a greatly improved progression system, the resurrection of rune words, and NPC companions are all major wins for Diablo 4, even when it seems we’ll be waiting a bit to see where this interlude expansion leads.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Sony's has a new generation of gaming monitors on the way, and that's a good thing because it means that the current line has been heavily discounted to help clear the way. Normally $900, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0B3SHR8TF?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">the 27-inch Sony Inzone M9 monitor</a> has been discounted by 22% and is now available for $698 through Amazon. This is an excellent price for the display, especially if you're looking for something that can take advantage of your PS5 console's features and horsepower.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4378779-sony-inzone-gen-1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4378779" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4378779-sony-inzone-gen-1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4378779"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4378779-sony-inzone-gen-1.jpg"></figure><p>The first generation of Inzone gaming monitors aren't perfect, but if you're looking for a rock-solid device, these are reliable pieces of tech with a plug-and-play design. Internally, they're 4K monitors with a 144Hz refresh rate, a 1ms GTG response time, and are DisplayHDR 600 certified. They're made specifically for PS5 consoles, but you can still use them as a PC monitor if you want to, as they have a built-in KVM switch for quick-swapping between machines.</p><p>On top of that, there are two HDMI 2.1 ports, Nvidia G-Sync compatibility, and other PS5-centric features to take advantage of. As a first-gen model, there are some kinks to be wary of--like its stiff stand, some iffy colors in select situations, and a lack of cables out of the box--but at this price, this is a very good 4K monitor for PS5 console owners.</p><p>If you'd prefer to wait, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Compatible-DisplayHDR-Anti-Glare-DisplayPort/dp/B0D9R7HCVG?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Inzone M10S</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sony-INZONE-Monitor-DisplayHDR-Speakers/dp/B0D9R8YPK3?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Inzone M9 II</a> will be available this month. The $800 M9 II launches today and is a 27-inch 4K IPS display with a 160Hz refresh rate, a 1ms response rate, support for both DisplayPort and HDMI, and what appears to be a better stand. While it's more expensive at $1,100, the 27-inch M10S does have a lightning-quick 480Hz refresh rate, up to 0.03ms response time, and an adjustable stand inside of its 1440p design, making it a very attractive monitor for competitive gamers specifically.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4378781-sony-gen-2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4378781" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4378781-sony-gen-2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4378781"></a><figcaption>Sony Inzone M10S and M9 II monitors</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4378781-sony-gen-2.jpg"></figure><ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sony-Compatible-DisplayHDR-Anti-Glare-DisplayPort/dp/B0D9R7HCVG?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Inzone M10S</a> -- $1,100 | Releases October 18</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sony-INZONE-Monitor-DisplayHDR-Speakers/dp/B0D9R8YPK3?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Inzone M9 II</a> -- $800</li></ul><p>Sony hasn't just released its own line of gaming monitors, it's also dabbled in some other tech like headsets and earbuds for the InZone line.

            <p>
A month on from Eurogamer's previous report, GAME customers say they are still waiting to receive games they paid to pre-order, without the ability to cancel these orders online.
</p>
<p>
Eurogamer continues to be contacted by customers who handed over money for games due to launch weeks ago that are still waiting to receive their orders.
</p>
<p>
And now, with the autumn season of big game launches set to kick off properly with <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/silent-hill-2">Silent Hill 2</a> and Metaphor ReFantazio, there's concern that pre-orders for these games will also fail to materialise.
</p>
<p>
GAME customers tell Eurogamer that questions about outstanding pre-orders - some now more than a month late - are falling on deaf ears, with queries to the brand's customer support on social media and its website going unanswered.
</p>
<p>
The problem appears to originate with GAME switching over to systems owned by its parent company, Frasers Group, at the end of August. As a result, any pre-orders made on or before 19th August no longer show in customers' online accounts. As <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/game-acknowledges-website-issues-as-customers-await-missing-pre-orders">Eurogamer reported previously,</a> this also means customers have no way to cancel orders that are weeks late, or pre-emptively cancel orders for upcoming releases to purchase a product elsewhere.
</p>
<p>
Head to GAME's customer service website and there's an update, dated to September, acknowledging "some" orders are now late.
</p>
<p>
"Following some important system changes, customers are currently experiencing delays with some of their orders," GAME's website notes. "These delays also affect some of the recent video game releases. 
</p>
<p>
"We're working closely with our fulfilment teams to get the outstanding orders out as quickly as we can and apologise for the current delays."
</p>
<p>
The website also notes that contacting its customer service team is also experiencing delays due to a high volume of issues.
</p>
<p>
"We're a little busier than usual right now, so it's taking us longer to reply," a warning message on the site states. "Our Customer Services team are working hard to reply as quickly as possible. Thanks for your patience, and we apologise for the delay."
</p>
<p>
Eurogamer contacted Frasers Group about customers' continued wait today, but has not heard a response.
</p>
<p>
A month ago, a spokesperson for the company told Eurogamer that the GAME website was "currently undergoing upgrades" which it was working to resolve "quickly".
</p>
<p>"We are aware that some customers are experiencing issues accessing their GAME accounts and order details," a Frasers Group representative told us in September. "We are working to have these resolved quickly and encourage customers to get in touch with our customer service team if they are experiencing issues.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/53-of-gamers-prefer-single-player-games/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>A new study has been released that shows 53% of gamers prefer single-player games. With how difficult it is for live-service games to break onto the market successfully, it makes sense that more and more single-player games are instead rising to the top and are proving to be more successful than any multiplayer game. A study carried out by Rhys Elliott discusses how most of the AAA games market revenue comes from in-game purchases that are typically from live service games. However, the market is also admittedly oversaturated, with some <a href="https://wccftech.com/concord-staff-says-game-was-referred-to-as-the-future-of-playstation/">live-service games failing from the outset</a>.</p>
<p>It's becoming exceedingly rare that live-service games are able to make a name for themselves in the market, and every time a new one is made successfully, it makes room for new entrants even smaller. While a lot of AAA developers on consoles and PC are attempting to make big revenue from live-service games, most gamers prefer to play single-player games.</p>
<p>In the <a href="https://www.midiaresearch.com/blog/most-gamers-prefer-single-player-games" target="_blank" rel="noopener">latest gaming report by Midia</a> Research, it shows that single-player games are the preferred way to play games. There are any developers out there who have created single-player games previously and tried to make their way into the market of making live-service games, but found that it was a catastrophic failure. One of these examples is the huge success of The Last of Us, but The Last of Us Online was nowhere near as successful and was very quickly scrapped by Naughty Dog and PlayStation.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>While it is stated that live-service games are predominantly the bread winners in the industry, new single-player games continue to break records and can generate millions. For example, while most think of iconic franchises like The Legend of Zelda or Spider-Man, Elden Ring sold 25 million copies, with Black Myth: Wukong selling 20 million. Both are predominantly single-player games, with Elden Ring offering a multiplayer option for those who want it.</p>
<p>A huge factor into what players want is also dependent on age range. For example, those who are in their younger generations tend to focus more on playing live-service games, with the number starting to veer off once they hit the mid-20s. Those over the age of 25 tend to target single-player games the most, with a small portion of the gamers playing live-service games. Those who play single-player games tend to use portable devices, too, such as a Steam Deck or PlayStation Portal, to make gaming more accessible to them.</p>

			<p>As part of their Diablo IV Vessel of Hatred review program, Blizzard set up a roundtable Q&amp;A with all the reviewers involved to answer practically every major question about the expansion due to launch next Tuesday on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X. Keep scrolling to read all the answers from Game Director Brent Gibson, Lead Designer Rex Dickson, Lead Live Designer Colin Finer, and Producer Kyle Martin. We've grouped the responses by topic for convenience.</p>
<figure><figcaption>'Dark Citadel and The Undercity were both significant investments, as were Mercenaries, but the two largest areas of focus were the campaign/world and all the major systems changes.'</figcaption></figure>
<h2>General Vessel of Hatred Questions</h2>
<p><strong>Could you introduce the system or content that you focused on the most during the development process of Diablo IV Vessel of Hatred?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Rex Dickson:</strong> It is hard to say if there was any one specific area of emphasis, as we expect all our content to meet or exceed ‘Blizzard Quality’ expectations. Dark Citadel and The Undercity were both significant investments, as were Mercenaries, but the two largest areas of focus were the campaign/world and all the major systems changes.</p>
<p><strong>What specific aspects did you pay attention to when designing Nahantu, and what challenges did you face during the development process?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Rex Dickson:</strong> There were many aspects that were points of emphasis for us when designing Nahantu. One that comes to mind is how to achieve a warmer color palette while also delivering on that classic Gothic horror theme. Another is incorporating elements from Diablo II, like Travincal and Kurast Docks. I think the biggest challenge we had was ensuring creative alignment across such a huge team with so many amazing ideas.</p>
<p><strong>Will there be an Uber Version of Mephisto fighting like Lilith?! The boss fight in the story was amazing, really. It would be nice to have something like that in the "next chapter" instead of only the Uber Lilith.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Colin Finer:</strong> We won't have an Uber Mephisto fight available for the launch of Diablo IV Vessel of Hatred, but we're currently looking at all our Tormented Bosses and how we can expand that list. Mephisto's Harbinger is an awesome fight that we want to see return and is at the top of our list.</p>
<p><strong>The Festering Dark is a wonderful experience (getting lost, using the lamps, the darkness mechanic, etc). How did it all come together? Can you share the story about how that area was designed?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Rex Dickson:</strong> Initially, there was some fear that doing a dark maze format for a Diablo stronghold wasn’t going to be fun. There was a lot of iteration, landing on the right blend of ‘just enough’ UX without handholding. Additionally, it took us a lot of time to figure out how to get the mechanics dialed in. Certainly a pretty big departure for us in terms of gameplay. All of this came to fruition via countless playtests and feedback sessions, but we are happy with where it landed.</p>
<p><strong>The new Spiritborn class is characterized by its agility. In this regard, does it share any similarities with the Monk from Diablo III? Which playstyle has made the most significant impression on the development team so far?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Brent Gibson:</strong> Agility was very much one of the things we were focusing on. We wanted a class where martial arts was a big part of the playstyle, so it just made sense. As for the monk, we have a pretty solid grasp of the types of mechanics that work well in the game, and there are inspirations from several classes that you can see in the Spiritborn, but the mixture is very unique to the class itself and plays very different from the classes before.</p>
<p><strong>Any thoughts on an Armory type feature with loadouts so players can easily switch builds from Boss to Speedrun, etc.?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Brent Gibson:</strong> Absolutely! Armory is top of mind for all of us at the moment. The game has several new things that impact your build coming into Vessel of Hatred and there are more things to come as the game goes on. This means when we introduce something like an Armory, it has to be a system that can grow with us, so we are pressing to a more steady state with Vessel of Hatred so that the Armory system can start on a better footing. So, for us, this is more of a question of when the Armory is coming, not if.</p>
<figure><figcaption>'Regarding Mercenary utility in end-game content, it was always our aim to make Mercenary combat effectiveness fairly low. We don’t want them stealing kills or becoming more powerful than the wanderer. With that said, we did want Merc synergy with user builds to be a significant component of the experience. This includes reinforcements.'</figcaption></figure>
<h2>Mercenary System</h2>
<p><strong>Are there plans to further develop the Mercenary system in future seasons (i.e., new companions, expanded skill trees, new additions to the den)?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Rex Dickson:</strong> As with all new features, we first want to gauge the community reaction before we determine what our next steps are. If there is demand for investments in the Mercenaries feature from our fans, we will keep adding them to future releases moving forward.</p>
<p><strong>How will Mercenaries function in a party? What were the results of their utility in endgame content from the internal testing?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Rex Dickson:</strong> In parties, one mercenary can be used by each player as a Reinforcement. They must be Enlisted as a Reinforcement from the Mercenary Den prior to joining the party. Hired Mercenaries are disabled while in parties. Regarding Mercenary utility in end-game content, it was always our aim to make Mercenary combat effectiveness fairly low. We don’t want them stealing kills or becoming more powerful than the wanderer. With that said, we did want Merc synergy with user builds to be a significant component of the experience. This includes reinforcements.</p>
<p><strong>For high-level players who already have access to endgame content, does this major update to the Mercenaries system still provide valuable benefits?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Rex Dickson:</strong> Yes, we realize the high-level endgame players are mostly interested in content that expedites and/or benefits their progression. The best way to extract the mercenaries' value is by synergizing them with your build to make you more powerful vs. expecting them to be a significant source of kills in the endgame content.</p>
<figure><figcaption>'We spent a lot of time discussing what role Runewords should play. Ultimately, we were inspired by Diablo II's Runewords like Enigma - specifically the ability to steal other classes' magic. What we wanted to avoid was creating a situation where Runeword items were always BiS - we didn't want you to have to give up your Tempest Roar or perfectly rolled Fists of Fate to equip this new item type. We felt like that would narrow build diversity and creativity too much... we wanted runes to be complimentary to your build.'</figcaption></figure>
<h2>Runewords</h2>
<p><strong>Diablo IV Vessel of Hatred adds the Runewords system, aimed at empowering players. However, unlike Diablo II, it appears that runes cannot be used to craft new gear or drastically alter playstyles. What were the design considerations behind updating the Runewords system in this expansion, particularly in comparison to Diablo II? Was there a conscious effort to differentiate the mechanics from those in Diablo II?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Colin Finer:</strong> We have a lot of systems in Diablo IV that alter playstyles. So, we spent a lot of time discussing what role Runewords should play in that ecosystem. ultimately, we were inspired by Diablo II's Runewords like Enigma - specifically the ability to steal other classes' magic. What we wanted to avoid was creating a situation where Runeword items were always BiS - we didn't want you to have to give up your Tempest Roar or perfectly rolled Fists of Fate to equip this new item type. We felt like that would narrow build diversity and creativity too much... we wanted runes to be complimentary to your build.</p>
<p>That said, we have set up a new crafting option that allows you to craft Mythic uniques with sets of runes, which we think will capture the feeling of creating extremely powerful items as well as the feeling of incremental progress with each rune you find.</p>
<p><strong>What are your thoughts on adding effects for the individual Runes (similar to Diablo II) when they are being socketed, so there is another alternative to Gems besides Runewords?&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Colin Finer: </strong>Like all new features, we will iterate and add to the Runewords system over time. We think having additional affixes on individual runes is a cool idea and a great callback to Diablo II. Our goal with Diablo IV's Runewords is to reward experimentation as you figure out the best combination for your build with the runes that are dropping. If we find having additional affixes assists that goal, we're more than open to adding them.</p>
<figure><figcaption>'We have added two additional character slots to coincide with Diablo IV Vessel of Hatred. We have heard the community feedback about the desire for rebirth, and it is being considered and prioritized along with other top requests.'</figcaption></figure>
<h2>Seasons</h2>
<p><strong>Any thoughts on adding Seasons to the Eternal Realm? Something like Eternal Realm: Play Season content with your max level character. Season Realm: Start from Level 1.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Brent Gibson:</strong> We have definitely been paying close attention to both seasonal and eternal players. Both ways to play are hugely important to both the game and those who enjoy playing either way. We are taking a very close look at our features as we consider what should live where. Infernal Hordes is a great example where we felt like this should live in both places. I think we can expect more updates where content and features may exist in both realms. As we move forward we will be transparent about it, but we are not at a point where we can talk specifics about anything at this time.</p>
<p><strong>We are reaching the point of deleting characters just to make room for Seasonal ones. Do you have any plans to introduce a "Rebirth" function so we can keep the gameplay stats (hours played, how many times Rebirthed, max achievements, etc.) between seasons?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Rex Dickson:</strong> We have added two additional character slots to coincide with Diablo IV Vessel of Hatred. We have heard the community feedback about the desire for rebirth, and it is being considered and prioritized along with other top requests.</p>
<p><strong>Is there any chance to keep the Mephisto lore forward on the Seasons?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Rex Dickson:</strong> Generally, our seasonal storylines are more standalone episodes and not part of the main Diablo IV storyline. That said we do take opportunities to do subtle hints and nods that help fill in the lore and hint at future releases. Certainly, we are not done hearing from Mephisto.</p>
<figure><figcaption>'Dark Citadel is a big new idea for a Diablo game, and we want to gauge the community reaction before we decide how we want to move forward with it. If we see a lot of feedback that we do more with this mode, then we will certainly take that into consideration in our future release planning.'</figcaption></figure>
<h2>Dark Citadel</h2>
<p><strong>Is there a possibility we could see Dark Citadel content that's soloable, but perhaps with AI companions or mercenaries filling in for the rest of the party?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Rex Dickson:</strong> Unfortunately, making a solo version of the Dark Citadel would amount to a major re-design, turning it into something quite different than what we intended. Creating viable AI partners for all the custom mechanics featured in the Dark Citadel is an interesting idea but would represent a significant investment for our team in creating custom components not used elsewhere in the game.</p>
<p><strong>Will we get more raid content in the future following the Dark Citadel? If so, are these limited to expansions, or will they be added with new Seasons?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Rex Dickson:</strong> Dark Citadel is a big new idea for a Diablo game, and we want to gauge the community reaction before we decide how we want to move forward with it. If we see a lot of feedback that we do more with this mode, then we will certainly take that into consideration in our future release planning.</p>
<p><strong>Is there a roadmap that can be shared on World Bosses or bigger group/raid content beyond the Dark Citadel, or is that the direction for the near future?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Rex Dickson:</strong> Our focus right now is on the Diablo IV Vessel of Hatred release. Moving forward, we have a roadmap that includes our top priorities we really want to work on. However, like all live service games, everything we do is guided by what our community wants. Any additional investments in things like larger scale group content would only come if the community demanded it.</p>
<figure><figcaption>'We have big plans for the continuation of the story going forward. One of the things I am looking forward to seeing is how the return of Mephisto impacts Sanctuary as a whole. As we lead up to future releases, we want to see threads of continuity from season to season. You see this already with the Realm Walker spreading hatred and corruption in season six. These are some of the things you can expect and it shows you that the spread of Mephisto’s influence goes well beyond just Nahantu.'</figcaption></figure>
<h2>Story</h2>
<p><strong>The story of Diablo IV Vessel of Hatred is also dark and gloomy. There seem to be many thought-provoking lines, so what aspects did you pay special attention to during the development stage?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Rex Dickson:</strong> One of the hallmark elements of the Diablo series is the dark tone. It is a critical part of our process to ensure tonal consistency across each franchise entry. This permeates the visuals as well as the narrative and quest design. Our game director sets some high-level themes they want to establish, and the teams come together to determine how best to achieve them. This was especially challenging given the warmer color palette of the expansion. We are incredibly proud of the results.</p>
<p><strong>Why did you decide to finish the story like you did? Do you believe people might be disappointed by the ending and the quests after the final fight? &nbsp;What are your plans for continuing the story? Will we see the finale in another DLC, as part of the Seasons, or in the next Diablo main game?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Brent Gibson:</strong> Great questions. For the first, we knew we wanted the story of Mephisto to be told over multiple releases. It is exciting to build up a character like him over a longer period of time. Many times in games, you rush a character's development because you only have so much time to tell your story. The exciting thing about a live game is that we can build up over multiple expansions, making our character richer and more meaningful. This is just the next chapter of that story.</p>
<p>For the second, a good story shouldn’t rush to its conclusion immediately. The buildup is exciting and important. Some of my favorite fiction leave you on a cliffhanger as they build that tension to an epic conclusion. This is what we are looking to build up as we unfold the fate of Mephisto.</p>
<p>For the last, we have big plans for the continuation of the story going forward. One of the things I am looking forward to seeing is how the return of Mephisto impacts Sanctuary as a whole. As we lead up to future releases, we want to see threads of continuity from season to season. You see this already with the Realm Walker spreading hatred and corruption in season six. These are some of the things you can expect and it shows you that the spread of Mephisto’s influence goes well beyond just Nahantu.</p>
<p><strong>Did the team consider bringing back Ormus' voice actor from Diablo II?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Kyle Martin</strong>:&nbsp; We did reach out but were told that William Bassett has chosen to retire and we wanted to respect that. Agreed, he has an iconic voice; I love his performance in Diablo II!</p>
<figure><figcaption>'We also love metaprogression systems, and we always want Diablo IV to feel rewarding, no matter how deep into a character or season you are. We think a metaprogression system would help accomplish that. It’s something we’re actively discussing, but we don’t have anything to share just yet. In terms of activity specialization, we’ve been leaning into an evolved philosophy of ‘primary’ reward sources and more universal ‘secondary’ sources – an example of this is Boss Summoning materials. The best place to get summoning parts of Varshan is to do Whispers, but they also drop in a bunch of different places across the game. As long as you’re playing, you should be getting a steady trickle.'</figcaption></figure>
<h2>Balance and Progression Changes</h2>
<p><strong>Players can now invest up to five skill points in Ultimate Skills. Can players expect builds focused on Ultimate Skills to become more viable? Additionally, if there are any Runeword or Mercenaries that can support Ultimate Skills, please introduce them.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Colin Finer:</strong> We absolutely want Ultimates to be more viable, and this is just one of the steps we're taking to make them so. We have a Rune of Ritual, Zan, that triggers on ultimate use and a Rune of Invocation, Zec, that reduces the cooldown of your Ultimate skills. Plus, there's an Aspect that, on Ultimate cast, triggers your Mercenary reinforcement, allowing you to double-dip on that power.</p>
<p><strong>Resources have been a major choke point in the test environment, particularly Iron Chunks and Angelsbreath. Are there plans either to increase drop rates through Salvaging or reduce the items needed for potion and gear upgrades?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Colin Finer:</strong> The launch of Diablo IV Vessel of Hatred will have sweeping tuning and balance changes, especially on crafting resource economy. The final tuning state requires significantly less salvage for item modification as well as huge buffs to salvage sources from things like Bosses, Whisper Caches, and the Infernal Hordes. A change we made based on player feedback from the PTR is all non-legendary items are auto-salvaged starting in Torment, so you'll get a lot more there.</p>
<p><strong>How will the change in max level/Paragon levels affect existing characters?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Colin Finer:</strong> All characters, whether or not you've purchased Diablo IV Vessel of Hatred, will have all Paragon points converted to realm-wide Paragon levels. For example, if your character is currently Level 100, your character level will be reduced to 50, and all 200 Paragon Points your character has earned will be converted to Realm-wide Paragon Levels.&nbsp;If your character is Level 50 and below, nothing will change for them. The benefit of this is that all existing alt and future characters benefit from the same paragon level pool, allowing them to catch up to your main character's endgame progress faster.</p>
<p><strong>Will there be a way for Diablo IV Vessel of Hatred players to pick and choose what they want to play and progress without being gated or forced into a particular activity (i.e., The Pit for Glyphs?)</strong></p>
<p><strong>Colin Finer:</strong> We also love metaprogression systems, and we always want Diablo IV to feel rewarding, no matter how deep into a character or season you are. We think a metaprogression system would help accomplish that. It’s something we’re actively discussing, but we don’t have anything to share just yet.</p>
<p>In terms of activity specialization, we’ve been leaning into an evolved philosophy of ‘primary’ reward sources and more universal ‘secondary’ sources – an example of this is Boss Summoning materials. The best place to get summoning parts of Varshan is to do Whispers, but they also drop in a bunch of different places across the game. As long as you’re playing, you should be getting a steady trickle.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/diablo-iv-vessel-of-hatred-review-jungle-jamboree<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>It's only been a year since the release of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/diablo-iv-review"><em>Diablo IV</em></a>, but if you've gotten tired of the grind for more power, now might just be the best time to dive back into the fray. The release of <em>Diablo IV: Vessel of Hatred</em> should reignite some passion for the game, as it comes with sweeping changes that make it feel like a more whole, comprehensive experience.</p>
<p>Continuing just about right where the previous campaign ended, players will once again have a pivotal role in the history of the Sanctuary. Along with said sweeping changes come brand new inclusions like the jungle of Nahantu, as well as the Spiritborn, which<em> </em>might just be the most fun you'll have with a <em>Diablo </em>class yet.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/diablo-iv-vessel-of-hatred-cutscene.jpg?itok=-IgHsSwi 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/diablo-iv-vessel-of-hatred-cutscene.jpg?itok=RmH1ZwDb 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>On a cinematic level, <em>Diablo IV: Vessel of Hatred</em> never disappoints.</figcaption></figure><h2>The Fate of Sanctuary Continues in <em>Diablo IV: Vessel of Hatred</em></h2>
<p>Some players are here for purely the loot, but me? I'm all about <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9BQWqUfuH8"><em>Diablo IV</em>'s story</a>. I'm pleased to see it continue in <em>Diablo IV: Vessel of Hatred</em>, because it's clear Blizzard has much more to say in this saga. Old characters make an appearance, while new ones take the spotlight during key moments in the story.</p>
<p>While most of <em>Diablo IV: Vessel of Hatred</em> takes place within a brand new, jungle zone of the map called Nahantu, you'll begin the story in Kyovashad. Here, we'll get a first-hand look at the direct consequences of the battle that took place in Hell in the previous campaign. There's a new, fanatical sect of the Holy Cathedral that takes a critical look at religious fanaticism.</p>
<p>As I said, Nahantu is the main setting, so we don't see all that much of this fanatical sect. Seeing a rift between different parts of the Cathedral could be an intriguing topic to explore, but this particular plotline feels a little underbaked. That said, Nahantu is and always was the main focus, and we'll spend just about the whole campaign within the confines of this new area.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/diablo-iv-nahantu.jpg?itok=wCP3s6oQ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/diablo-iv-nahantu.jpg?itok=6UYxxWdQ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Seeing more of <em>Diablo</em>'s world is always welcome.</figcaption></figure><p>This jungle is also home to the Spiritborn, so it thematically coincides with this expansion's brand new class. I was captivated by the worldbuilding of Nahantu, and I couldn't help but admire the various inhabitants and settlements -- it feels culturally distinct from the likes of Kyovashad and Ked Bardu -- and it's almost as if the jungle itself is a character of its own.</p>
<p>One of <em>Diablo IV: Vessel of Hatred</em>'s main characters is Eru, a Spiritborn and also a leader among his people. Voiced by the talented Lou Diamond Phillips, Eru is a complicated but likable character who does a lot to elevate the appeal of the story.</p>
<p>I'm trying to be very vague here so as not to spoil, but despite liking the setting and characters, <em>Diablo IV: Vessel of Hatred</em>'s story failed to captivate me as much as the main campaign. Many of the main quests felt a bit like filler, in that you arrive at your destination, only to find you need to complete another objective first. There's meandering that seems like padding, rather than serving the narrative.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/diablo-4-jungle.jpg?itok=X7HdaoIT 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/diablo-4-jungle.jpg?itok=65eujZ6j 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Pump up those graphics to max if you can -- the game will look even better than this screenshot!</figcaption></figure><h2>Welcome to the Jungle</h2>
<p>As for Nahantu itself, it's a beautiful and lush jungle full of dangerous monsters with corruption setting in, threatening those who live within. Nahantu is <em>Diablo IV</em>'s best area yet, trumping the marshy wetlands of Hawezar and the snowy plains of the Fractured Peaks. It's very fun to explore because it <em>feels</em> like a jungle, in that there are so many winding pathways and hidden secrets.</p>
<p>Blizzard certainly knocks it out of the park in terms of visual presentation. If you're brave enough to knock those graphics up high, the intricate details of the various ziggurat-like structures along with reflections from the rain of the damp jungle -- well, it's a visual treat -- not to mention an auditory treat for the ears with its soundtrack.</p>
<p>We don't quite reach the same highs as the original campaign in terms of bombastic visual moments, and there are fewer cinematics (to be fair, it <em>is</em> an expansion, and not a full game), but there are several key sequences that are breathtaking. I only wish the tone and look of the jungle was a bit darker, as it errs more towards the side of <em>Diablo III</em> rather than <em>Diablo II. </em></p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/diablo-iv-spiritborn-combat-2.jpg?itok=WDOC7R4- 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/diablo-iv-spiritborn-combat-2.jpg?itok=M9AjQitZ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Calling upon various animal spirits is a fun concept.</figcaption></figure><h2><em>Diablo IV</em>'s Best Character Class Yet?</h2>
<p>Before <em>Diablo IV</em> launched, class fantasy was a big focus for Blizzard. While the classes in the base campaign were fun, I didn't gravitate toward anyone in particular. After playing <em>Vessel of Hatred</em>'s Spiritborn, I'm convinced this is my main for as long as the servers remain up.</p>
<p>In terms of capturing that class fantasy, yes, Spiritborn absolutely delivers. It helps that Nahantu, an area inhabited by other Spiritborn, is the focus of the story, but in terms of abilities, the various, beautifully rendered spell effects reflect the immense amount of power a Spiritborn draws from.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/diablo-iv-spiritborn-combat.jpg?itok=s9HGHVx4 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/diablo-iv-spiritborn-combat.jpg?itok=dz2oNL-e 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>At times, Spiritborn's attacks create absolute chaos, and in turn destroy enemies quite easily.</figcaption></figure><p>With four main spirits: Jaguar, Eagle, Gorilla, and Centipede, and abilities revolving around these aspects, it's easy to craft a build with Spiritborn. I opted for Eagle, which is this highly mobile, evasive class that uses lightning-based attacks and spectral feathers. Others, like Centipede, will focus on poison, so it's very easy to tune your build around a specific spirit.</p>
<p>However, Spiritborn is highly versatile in that there are advantages to mixing and matching the various spirits, meaning you can have a Gorilla/Jaguar-based build, or an Eagle/Jaguar build. There are certain abilities and legendary affixes that incentivize this mixing and matching, meaning there is potential for a <em>ton</em> of variation while still remaining viable.</p>
<p>Complementing your build are mercenaries, not unlike those in <em>Diablo III</em>. You're able to unlock them via a questline, so mercs are unique characters rather than randomly generated. They come with a skill tree, and said skills will act as a supplement to your own abilities. There's now even more potential for synergies via these trees, leading to so many different possibilities.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/diablo-4-merc.jpg?itok=qzRih20W 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/diablo-4-merc.jpg?itok=76xXp8R- 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Mercenaries have their own introductory questlines.</figcaption></figure><p>One mercenary is active at a time, but another can act as backup. You can dictate how this backup merc acts. So for example, I can make the backup use their ability <em>only</em> when I cast a specific spell, sort of like an "if/then" statement. As one might expect, this leads to potentially enhancing your own skills by combining them with those of the merc.</p>
<p>I had a lot of fun experimenting with the various legendary affixes for Spiritborn, and I am <em>very</em> interested to see how crazy builds can get once other players have a chance to use this class. The review build, I'm told, was a little more difficult than intended, so I'm hoping classes perform a bit better at launch. Nonetheless, the difficulty is nothing a bit of grinding for loot can't overcome.</p>
<p>And if you're grinding for loot, well, you're in for a plethora of options -- it may as well be a buffet. There's Dark Citadel, a cooperative-only mode players can run with friends. It requires more coordination so it's akin to a dungeon or raid in an MMO. I didn't get a chance to test this one, but it seems to have been received positively by other reviewers playing.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/diablo-4-merc-skilltree.jpg?itok=VXUe6hXc 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/diablo-4-merc-skilltree.jpg?itok=I1nelV1- 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Merc skill trees aren't the most complex thing ever, but it does introduce more options for your build.</figcaption></figure><p>If you're more of a solo player like me, don't fret: There are other options. Kurast Undercity is a time-attack mode that asks players to frantically fight through a few tiers of a dungeon, accumulating greater rewards along the way. Build up attunement to get the biggest reward, though said reward is only granted after killing the boss at the end.</p>
<p>Undercity was fun, if a bit thematically repetitive. It felt like a Greater Rift from <em>Diablo III</em>; essentially, a race against the clock while fighting droves of enemies. I could see myself going through this a lot at launch, but it's my hope it remains rewarding even in the higher tiers of difficulty.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/diablo-iv-undercity_0.jpg?itok=cs6E9-Dh 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/diablo-iv-undercity_0.jpg?itok=9f33nUgj 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Time attack content in <em>Diablo IV</em> is always a frantic blast.</figcaption></figure><h2><em>Diablo IV: Vessel of Hatred Review | </em>Final Thoughts</h2>
<p>There's so much more to <em>Diablo IV: Vessel of Hatred</em> that it's almost overwhelming; one may as well call it a brand new game. On top of existing content from various seasons, there's a new level cap, different ways to enhance gear, Paragon level changes, new abilities for existing classes, and... look, we'd be here all day if I had to go over everything. Rest assured, said changes make <em>Diablo IV</em> feel fresh.</p>
<p><em>Diablo IV</em> is in a good place, and <em>Vessel of Hatred</em> contributes to that immensely. The story isn't as strong as the original, but most people are staying for the grind for better loot. On that end, it won't disappoint. If I had to guess, <em>Diablo IV</em> is going to be remembered fondly, so long as we keep getting more quality content like <em>Vessel of Hatred</em>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://kotaku.com/joker-2-folie-a-deux-movie-review-cast-showtimes-1851665425<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>It’s been five years since Todd Phillips’ <em>Joker</em> gave us a bleak, ultra-realistic take on the iconic comic book villain. Set in a seedy 1980s version of Gotham, <em>Joker</em>’s nihilism touched on contemporary issues such as political divides, wealth disparity, and social isolation, which only intensified after the covid pandemic. There was (and still is) a lot of critical debate about whether or not the film glorified the clown’s violent actions or served as a cautionary tale about the community’s neglect of marginalized individuals. <em>Joker: Folie à Deux</em>, sadly, has an even more muddled point of view—and it’s also just a worse movie.</p><p> After shooting talk show host Murray Franklin live on national television in the first film, Arthur Fleck (Joaquin Phoenix in another wacky yet redundant performance) spends five miserable years in Arkham Asylum awaiting his trial, and has since become a cultural icon known as the Joker. One of the guards Arthur Fleck befriends (a tough Brendan Gleeson) enrolls him in a music therapy class, where he meets Harleen “Lee” Quinzel, played by pop icon and movie star Lady Gaga.</p><h2 id="h558"><a id=""></a><strong>An anti-musical musical?</strong></h2><p>There’s been a lot of conversation about whether or not <em>Joker: Folie à Deux </em>can be considered a musical. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.thewrap.com/joker-folie-a-deux-todd-phillips-says-its-a-musical/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.thewrap.com/joker-folie-a-deux-todd-phillips-says-its-a-musical/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">During a Venice Film Festival press conference</a></span> last month, Gaga said, “I think the way we approach music in this film is very special and extremely nuanced. I wouldn’t necessarily say that this is a musical. In a lot of ways it’s very different.” Todd Phillips said something similar the month prior, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://variety.com/2024/film/features/todd-phillips-joker-2-movie-interview-1236111122/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://variety.com/2024/film/features/todd-phillips-joker-2-movie-interview-1236111122/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">telling <em>Variety</em> that</a></span> “most of the music in the movie is really just dialogue. It’s just Arthur not having the words to say what he wants to say, so he sings them instead.” But characters singing their emotions out loud is literally the definition of a musical, so people were, naturally, confused.</p><p>Joker and Harley in <em>Joker: Folie à Deux</em> certainly do sing their emotions (quite a bit), but the numbers they perform are hardly showstoppers. While there are some exceptions (which are the only real quality parts of the movie), the majority of the musical sequences are ordinary, everyday scenes of Joker and Harley whisper-singing to themselves or sharing their favorite songs from the radio. They’re not the stop-and-stare moments found in most musicals, you’re not swept away by the lively movement and soaring vocals that make you feel everything the character is feeling. </p><p>In <em>Joker: Folie à Deux</em>, classic American songs such as “That’s Entertainment,” “I’ve Got the World on a String,” and “Gonna Build A Mountain” are randomly thrown in and performed with wafer-thin voices, articulating very little about the current situation or a character’s perspective. <em>Joker: Folie à Deux </em>seems like the mumblecore version of a musical–and it had <em>LADY FREAKIN’ GAGA </em>at its disposal, a woman who has proven, time and time again, that she’s one of the best contemporary pop singers. </p><figure id="" data-id="f812f604a56a98214ab2dc4e26414106" data-recommend-id="image://f812f604a56a98214ab2dc4e26414106" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Joker and Harley stand in a spotlight.

" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>If Todd Phillips had leaned more into the musical genre—going over-the-top with the song choices to express Arthur Fleck’s mental health struggles, disdain for society, or overwhelming obsession with Harley—he would have given the songs more purpose. The format of Rob Marshall’s <em>Chicago</em>, where the vibrant musical numbers are inside the main characters’ heads as a form of escapism from their daily life, would have been a perfect fit for this film.<br></p><p>There are two scenes that jolt us out of the movie’s monotony, making us care about the eccentric couple’s romance despite their non-existent spark. One of the best scenes is when Joker imagines himself singing the Bee Gees’ “To Love Somebody” with Harley on a<em> Sonny &amp; Cher Show-</em>esque television series, dressed to the nines and standing in front of flowing curtains that burst with Technicolor hues of red, blue, and yellow. In another scene, they dance on a rooftop, with Joker in his suit and Harley in a flowing white dress, bringing to mind the elegance of Fred Astaire and Ginger Rogers. A giant moon illuminates the bright blue sky that reminds us of the fantastical visuals of <em>Moulin Rouge</em>. </p><p>Another standout moment features Joaquin Phoenix warbling “For Once in My Life” in the prison rec room; at first, we’re unsure if the inmates can truly hear him, but clever cuts reveal that it’s all in his head. With his perpetually furrowed brow and weepy eyes, his whole body vibrates with desperation. He also appears scarily thin—more so than in the first film, with his shoulder blades jutting out sharply. Phoenix’s performance carries<em> Joker: Folie à Deux</em> as much as it did the first <em>Joker</em>, keeping us invested in Arthur Fleck’s collapsing mental state despite the tedium of the story. But listening to his flat, ragged singing over and over again with little variation becomes more grating as the movie goes on. </p><h2 id="h559"><a id=""></a><strong>Gaga, oo la la</strong></h2><p>While Lady Gaga certainly brings a quiet intensity to the role of Joker’s sweetheart, this version of the Harley Quinn character is more of a wide-eyed waif, lacking the firecracker personality found in other iterations. She’s still completely obsessed with Joker, gazing at him with starry eyes and confessing that she’s seen the made-for-TV movie about him hundreds of times, but <em>Joker: Folie à Deux </em>puts an interesting twist on that loyalty. Although it’s interesting that Todd Phillips takes a more low-key, gritty approach to her character—especially during her special visit to Arthur’s cell—other iterations of Harley Quinn and Joker are far more complex and fascinating. In <em>Joker: Folie à Deux</em>, Joker and Lee barely spend any time together, and their lackluster singing fails to establish any real chemistry or emotional depth. </p><figure id="" data-id="3fae262d0ba0497a78e558761df9d57a" data-recommend-id="image://3fae262d0ba0497a78e558761df9d57a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Lady Gaga on the poster for Joker 2." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Lady Gaga on the poster for Joker 2." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Photo<!-- -->: <!-- -->Warner Bros.

But yet again, the singing is softer, quieter, than it should be at this moment. The notion of Lady Gaga as Harley Quinn—a fiery character beloved by so many portrayed by a fiery popstar beloved by so many—had so much promise. But she often fades into the background, given little to do throughout the film aside from sitting on the courtroom sidelines. What a waste.<br></p><p>Lee’s sole purpose is to get Arthur Fleck to believe that the most important thing about him is being the Joker, and he should embrace his true identity during his trial. This is directly against the wishes of Fleck’s government-appointment lawyer Maryanne (a detached Catherine Keener), who wants him to pursue the insanity defense. This tension between Arthur and his Joker persona should be riveting, but the courtroom scenes are a snooze, barely unpacking interesting themes like where Arthur Fleck ends and the Joker begins, or whether the true sickness lies within him or the world itself. </p><p>This sudden shift into the legal drama genre retreads past details we already know without offering anything new. Unlike the first film, in which we witness the gradual dissolution of Joker’s mental health and his growing anger toward an uncaring society, <em>Joker: Folie à Deux </em>has zero plot momentum or character development. </p><p>Todd Phillips’ direction felt more comfortable in the first film, a paint-by-numbers riff on Martin Scorsese’s <em>Taxi Driver</em> and <em>The King of Comedy</em> infused with DC lore. <em>Joker: Folie à Deux </em>would have benefited from the director taking his cues from other movies, either fully embracing a subversive realism similar to Lars Von Trier’s <em>Dancer in the Dark</em> or giving us a direct homage to Hollywood Golden Age musicals like <em>Singin’ in the Rain </em>or <em>The Band Wagon</em>. </p><p>But this is adrift in the middle, as numb and apathetic as its emotionally damaged characters. <em>Joker: Folie à Deux </em>wallows in uninspired misery with little to say about Arthurt’s mental stability, his romance with Lee, or what led him to the courtroom in the first place. Unfortunately, the best part of <em>Joker: Folie à Deux</em> is the opening scene, a Looney Tunes-style animation about the Joker’s shadow: which offers a fun, focused story before shifting into mundanity. <em>Joker: Folie à Deux</em> is a failed experiment that squanders its promising concept and stellar cast on a lackluster and overly dour vision. Musicals may not be everyone’s cup of tea, but <em>Joker: Folie à Deux </em>managed to make the genre mind-numbingly boring.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>In recent years, survival games have seen a monumental boom, growing in popularity at a staggering rate on a global scale. There’s something compelling about being thrown into a wasteland or an intense environment and being forced to survive by collecting resources, finding food, and fighting desperately against enemies. With that in mind, we’re looking at a list of the best survival games in 2024.</p>



<p>If you’re in the market for one of the top survival games, you won’t want to sleep on this list. Be warned, though – some of these games are hard as nails if you play them for long enough, and they’re rarely forgiving for newcomers.</p>



<p>Without further ado, here are the best survival games in 2024.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-sons-of-the-forest">Sons of The Forest</h2>



<figure></figure>







<p>Sons of the Forest was released in early access in 2023, and by 2024, it had ‘graduated’ into a fully released game – a 1.0. It’s easily one of the best coop survival games you’ll ever play, allowing you to explore a vast open world alongside your friends.</p>



<p>In Sons of the Forest, you’re involved in a chopper crash while flying over a mysterious, diverse island. From there, you’ll be left up to your own devices, being forced to scavenge, fight, and farm to survive the brutality of the game’s story.</p>



<p>It’s a spooky game that’s riddled with things to see and do, and you’ll never quite be done exploring the enormous map. At the drop of a hat, you can build a camp, drop trees, set up defences, and try your best to live a life on an island that really doesn’t want you to be there.</p>







<h2 id="h-rust">Rust</h2>



<figure></figure>







<p>Rust is iconic, and we could say that and just move on — but we won’t. First launched in 2013, Rust is often seen as the defining title of the survival genre, and it’s one of the best games on the market even ten years after it was released.</p>



<p>In Rust, players are dropped into a map and forced to make do with their own devices to survive and carve out a life for themselves in a hostile world filled with enemies – and other players. From farming for food to defending a home settlement, players are mostly free to do whatever they desire in Rust.</p>



<p>It’s not exactly forgiving, though. It can be a complex game for newcomers, but that’s part of the charm of Rust. It’s definitely one of the best survival games in 2024, and it likely will be for a long time to come.</p>



<h2 id="h-7-days-to-die">7 Days to Die</h2>



<figure></figure>







<p>In 2024, 7 Days to Die graduated to a full game from an early access release that took place ten years before. If that wasn’t important enough, the developer pumped the 1.0 version of the game full of new content and upgrades, making this survival game better than ever.</p>



<p>7 Days to Die is one of the most addictive zombie survival games ever made, giving players complete freedom over how they explore the world around them. It can be played solo or with friends, and it has a nice enough challenge written into it that makes you genuinely feel as though you’re trying hard to just survive.</p>



<p>With crafting elements, base-building mechanics, investory management, combat sequences, and resource farming, 7 Days to Die is inarguably one of the best survival games in 2024.</p>



<h2 id="h-frostpunk-2">Frostpunk 2</h2>



<figure></figure>







<p>Frostpunk 2 is a unique title, fusing city-building mechanics with a survival-based theme and giving players complete freedom to do as they please. It’s a post-apocalyptic, city-building survival game that’ll test your abilities to lead an ever-growing settlement of survivors.</p>



<p>In Frostpunk 2, players must manage power, food, shelter, factions, and assorted quests. It can be fairly taxing, but there’s a brilliant sandbox mode written into Frostpunk 2 that takes away much of the struggle.</p>



<p>Frostpunk 2 might be a little more niche as it’s a city-building game by definition, but it’s one of the top survival games on the market today, and it’s also one of the newest, having been released in September 2024.</p>



<h2 id="h-palworld">Palworld</h2>



<figure></figure>







<p>Palworld is a Pokémon-like game with open-world exploration elements and assault rifles, amongst other things. That’s right – in Palworld, you’ll catch and collect ‘Pals’ using balls, putting them to work or settling them up to fight other explorers and Pals that roam the map, and you can even equip them with rifles or rocket launchers if you desire.</p>



<p>Palworld became one of the most successful indie games of all time when it was released in January 2024. It pulled in millions of players in a relatively short period, with many of those players drawing their comparisons between Palworld and Pokémon. It was such a roaring success that competitors are now making ‘Pal-like’ games.</p>

<p>MMO games offer some of the most open-ended gameplay opportunities possible. If you want to create a character and spend hundreds – or thousands – of hours exploring a vast world filled with quests and content, then the best console MMOs are for you. Once upon a time, they were reserved for PC platforms only, but now, we’re listing the best MMOs for console in 2024.</p>



<p>From post-apocalyptic wastelands to vast fantasy worlds bursting with activities, the top MMOs on Xbox and PlayStation won’t disappoint. Read on to check out the top games in the space.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-final-fantasy-14">Final Fantasy 14</h2>



<figure></figure>







<p>FFXIV is renowned for its stunning visuals, breathtaking landscapes, and meticulously crafted character designs that contribute to a visually appealing and detailed game world. The inclusion of various job classes, each with its unique abilities and playstyles, provides players with a ton of options for character customization and gameplay.</p>



<p>On launch, FFXIV did not do so well. The developers chose to listen to the players and overhauled the game into what it is now, one of the most popular MMOs. Constantly releasing new content, and being able to play most of the game for free makes this a no-brainer for MMO fans. </p>



<p>With controls designed with the controller in mind, and performance optimization for consoles, the developers ensured that simple things like menus wouldn’t be nearly impossible to navigate on consoles. Final Fantasy 14 feels like you’re playing just another Final Fantasy but with thousands of other people!</p>











<figure></figure>







<p>Boasting an expansive and intricately detailed open world, Elder Scrolls Online allows players to explore the iconic lands of Tamriel. The game offers a level of immersion and freedom, much like that of the beloved Elder Scrolls single-player series. The game’s narrative is impressive, with each region having its compelling storyline and quests, providing players with a rich and varied gaming experience.</p>



<p>One of my best friends is captivated by ESO, putting well over 1000 hours into it. Every time I fire up the PS5, he is playing ESO. People love to explore a world that’s alive, and ESO will have you dropping hundreds of hours into it as you become entranced by the extremely detailed world of Tamriel. </p>



<p>Being able to bind spells to controller buttons, and switch between two hot bars on the fly, ESO for consoles is a great pick for a console MMO. The times I have played this game, I felt that using a controller was natural and that it played well.</p>







<h2 id="h-destiny-2">Destiny 2</h2>



<figure></figure>







<p>Not all MMOs have to be RPGs. Destiny and the follow-up Destiny 2 are MMOFPS games (Massive Multiplayer Online First Person Shooter), which when you think about it works well for consoles. Yes, PC elitists will tell you the only way to play a first-person shooter is with a PC and a monitor that has a 4,000 refresh rate. </p>



<p>What if I told you though, that playing Destiny on consoles isn’t just okay… it’s fun! Missions, raids, and PVP are all available for you to take on, and you have the choice of which to play. If you’re not the most competitive person, you can relax and play alongside others in missions and raids, but if you’re one of the hardcore ones, PVP is for you. </p>



<p>Regardless of your playstyle, Destiny 2 can have the best of the shooter and MMO worlds in one.</p>



<h2 id="h-fallout-76">Fallout 76</h2>



<figure></figure>







<p>Before you jump to the comments on this one, hear me out. Yes, Fallout 76 had a terrible launch, it had bugs that made even Bethesda blush, and people got cheap imitations of the swag they were promised by pre-ordering. </p>



<p>The team stuck with it, however, because six years after launch the game is pretty good. It shouldn’t have taken so long, but credit should be given to these guys not abandoning the project right away. After countless updates, the game falls in line with the rest of the series, offering multiplayer and an expansive world. </p>



<p>But how does it make a good console MMO? It’s the same game style as Fallout 4, which is a great console game, and in the time that it has been live, more than 15 million players have made their way into the wasteland. </p>







<h2 id="h-dc-universe-online">DC Universe Online</h2>



<figure></figure>







<p>DC Universe Online is the MMO that every Marvel fan wishes they had. You start by creating your hero or villain, already a fantastic start letting you choose if your character is good or bad. Once made, your character is injected into a world full of DC characters.</p>



<p>Unlike a lot of MMOs that have menus upon menus, and hot bars galore, DCUO is focused on fast action-packed combat. Aiming for more of a hack-and-slash style gameplay benefits controller users greatly and makes the game very enjoyable even if you don’t have a big ol’ gaming rig at your disposal. </p>



<p>That’s a pretty great endorsement. It’s very clear that if you enjoy DC in the slightest, DC Universe Online is your pick. The console version works very well, despite still lacking a next-gen upgrade, so you don’t need to be a ‘dirty PC player’ as Greg would say. Hack-and-slash action combat compliments controller users, giving them the ability to play just as well as PC users.</p>



<p>MMOs are popular for a reason, and with the number of consoles out in the wild, it’s good to know some MMOs are functional on your preferred platform. </p>



<p>Are there any more MMOs that work well on console? Let us know on the Insider Gaming forum.</p>

                <p>It's been a long time since voice actor David Hayter stepped into the role of Snake. For years, the character had been voiced by David Hayter, who became synonymous with the role. Though <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hayter-to-hear-another-snake-voice-makes-me-a-little-ill/1100-6406237/" data-ref-id="1100-6406237">Kiefer Sutherland</a> joined the ranks as Venom Snake, fans still carried Hayter's banner. Hayter's rendition of the character was seen in other properties as Super Smash Bros., with the game reusing previously recorded dialog, but the actor seemed to tease a return to the role in an unspecified project.</p><p>Taking to his <a href="https://x.com/DavidBHayter/status/1841994392896442768?t=xoUspc_un2dUmTvZmA2Ehw&amp;s=19" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Twitter</a>, the actor said he was back in the recording booth Thursday, saying he was playing a role he hasn't done in a long time. He then replied to that tweet with a GIF from the upcoming Snake Eater remake, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater/">Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</a>.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/DavidBHayter/status/1841994392896442768" data-has-image="false"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">I was in the booth today.<br>Playing a role I’ve not played, since…</p>  — David Hayter (@DavidBHayter) <a href="https://twitter.com/DavidBHayter/status/1841994392896442768?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 4, 2024</a></blockquote>              </div><p>Fans immediately and collectively lost their minds over the tease.

What's unclear is when the game would take place, as Snake was very rapidly aging by the end of Metal Gear Solid 4.</p>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom">The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</a> may be the only Zelda game wherein Link steps aside to let Zelda take the leading role, but apparently that's one game too many for some Link aficionados who've learned how to restore his as the main character.</p>
<p>It turns out that - somehow - fans have discovered that if you're able to pull off a little button pushin' wizardry after the first dungeon, you can complete the rest of The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom as Link.</p>

<p>It's not exactly easy to pull off - there's quite a lot of trial and error, including the ability to defeat an enemy with your controls menu open - but once you get through the gates in Suthorn Ruins, save a second copy of your game, and then play as you usually would until you get through the first dungeon.</p>
<p>Head through the east gates of the Kakariko Village, go north towards the forest and then, a little finger-twisting action later - see the video above - the next time you load up, Zelda will be replaced with Link.</p>
<p>All the progress you've made as Zelda thus far will be lost, but you'll continue the game as Link.</p>
<p>"This was definitely a glitch I didn't see coming, but maybe should have with the state of Echoes of Wisdom," said YouTuber Alyo, who provides the tutorial above. "Right now, there are many glitches and things being found, and one of them includes this bizarre glitch that allows for you to play as Link rather than as Zelda. It's a really interesting one that I was surprised to get working, but can't say it'll stay around forever. But for now, it's wild!"</p>
<p>ICYMI, The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom features an eye-opening glitch that lets you teleport to the game's final boss, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-speedrunners-pounce-on-glitch-that-lets-you-beat-game-in-an-hour">allowing speedrunners to beat the whole adventure in under an hour</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/tencent-and-guillemot-family-planning-ubisoft-buyout/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/tencent-and-guillemot-family-planning-ubisoft-buyout.1000869/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/tencent-and-guillemot-family-planning-ubisoft-buyout/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>In a new report today from Bloomberg (via <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/tencent-and-guillemot-family-reportedly-planning-ubisoft-buyout" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GamesIndustry.biz</a>), it's alleged that Tencent and the Guillemot family are reportedly planning on buying out Ubisoft. This comes after Ubisoft has repeatedly landed itself in hot water, not just with gamers but also with shareholders. Shareholders have been urging them to restructure the company for a long time now, but there has been no news from Ubisoft as to whether they are going to do that. Now, Tencent and Guillemot Brothers Ltd have been looking into ways to stabilize the company. With how badly Ubisoft is doing, it's possible that the companies will team up to buy out the publisher and take it private.</p>
<p>Sources that are close to the matter at hand spoke to Bloomberg, saying that the companies have spoken to advisors about how they can proceed with buying out the company. However, the talks are in the very early stages, so there is no guarantee that this will lead to a buyout of Ubisoft. This news comes after <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-small-investor-pushes-hard-for-the-companys-sale/">AJ Investments</a> called for Ubisoft to go private, as the share prices dropped to the lowest they'd ever been after the release of Star Wars Outlaws.</p>
<p>At the moment, Ubisoft's market capitalization is at a total of $1.5 billion, with <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-stock-prices-drop-another-7-shareholders-concerned/">shares dropping a total of 54%</a> so far this year. The prices of the shares even dropped to a ten-year low, as the company saw "softer than expected" sales of Star Wars Outlaws, with the director even expressing their disappointment in the game's overall reception.</p>
<p>Guillemot Brothers LTD is a family-run company where some of the members of the family are responsible for founding Ubisoft, including CEO Yves Guillemot. GBL holds 20% of the publisher's voting rights, with Tencent holding 9.2% of the rights. In 2022, Tencent <a href="https://wccftech.com/tencent-acquires-a-49-economic-stake-at-ubisoft-ubisofts-stock-price-increases-14/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">increased its stake</a> in GBL, which in turn increased its investment in Ubisoft.</p>
<p>Bloomberg did try to reach out to Ubisoft, GBL and Tencent for comment on the ongoing situation, with both Ubisoft and GBL declining to respond, with Tencent likely to follow in their footsteps.</p>
<p>Overall, it's been a troubling year for Ubisoft, as Star Wars Outlaws didn't perform how they hoped, and XDefiant is also in hot water. Additionally, Ubisoft announced the delay of <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-to-february-2025-ubisoft-announces-return-to-steam-on-day-1-and-departs-season-pass-model/">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a>, after many members of the developer team called for it to be pushed back to work on the accuracy of the history, as well as trying to polish the game to a playable standard.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/hasbro-board-games-coming-to-fortnite-starting-with-clue.1000866/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hasbro-board-games-fortnite-clue<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>UGC studio Look North World has announced it's teaming up with board game giant Hasbro in order to bring some of the company's most iconic board games to&nbsp;<em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em>via the UEFN creative tool.</p>
<p>Per a <a href="https://venturebeat.com/games/look-north-world-recreates-hasbro-titles-in-fortnite-starting-with-clue/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">VentureBeat report</a>, the first board game to get a Look North World adaptation is&nbsp;<em>Clue</em>, which is being released today as a&nbsp;<em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em>island by the name of&nbsp;<em>Murder Mystery: Clue</em>. You can <a href="https://looknorth.world/games/clue-cludeo" rel="noopener" target="_blank">download and check out that island here</a>.</p>
<p>Two more Hasbro board games are due to arrive in&nbsp;<em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em>throughout the rest of this year. The first is&nbsp;<em>Guess Who</em>, which is getting an island sometime later this month, while the second,&nbsp;<em>Connect Four</em>, will get a&nbsp;<em>Fortnite</em> island in December.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/clue-cluedo-game-fortnite-map.jpg?itok=Xrrd8atq 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/clue-cluedo-game-fortnite-map.jpg?itok=0XHoJbbw 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Have you ever wanted to play&nbsp;<em>Clue</em>-slash-<em>Cluedo&nbsp;</em>in&nbsp;<em>Fortnite</em>? Well, now you can.</figcaption></figure><p>According to VentureBeat's report, the&nbsp;<em>Clue</em>&nbsp;<em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em>island uses&nbsp;<em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em>elements and assets to recreate the board game, allowing players to play as either Killers, Detectives, or Guests.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It sounds like the island is an asymmetrical multiplayer experience, so each role has a different objective and win condition, although I'm not entirely clear on what role the Guests might play. Perhaps they just watch the whole thing unfold!</p>
<p>Hasbro digital strategy SVP Eugene Evans says the goal with bringing the company's board games to&nbsp;<em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em>is to "grow [Hasbro's] digital games portfolio through both licensing and internal development".</p>
<p>Evans goes on to say that Look North Games understands "the essence of what makes these games resonate with players", and that the best candidates for adaptations are "games that have attracted fans for decades".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/hasbro-guess-who-fortnite-announcement.jpg?itok=R5CVddy9 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/hasbro-guess-who-fortnite-announcement.jpg?itok=BAWt6r3I 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>You'll never guess who else is getting a&nbsp;<em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em>island.</figcaption></figure><p>An increasing number of developers and companies are using&nbsp;<em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em>islands to explore creative opportunities outside their usual games.</p>
<p><em>The Cycle&nbsp;</em>developer Yager, for instance, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/the-cycle-fortnite-map-yager">recently revived its ill-fated shooter</a> via a&nbsp;<em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em>UEFN island, and&nbsp;<em>Deliver Us the Moon&nbsp;</em>studio Keoken Interactive <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/deliver-us-the-moon-fortnite-map">also created a UEFN island</a> themed around its sci-fi adventure.</p>
<p>Look North World's&nbsp;<em>Clue&nbsp;</em><em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em>island is available to enjoy today; its island code is 0783-3570-5073, if you want to give it a try. The&nbsp;<em>Guess Who&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Connect Four&nbsp;</em>islands are coming later this year. Stay tuned for more.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/4/24262033/roblox-the-bear-cave-child-abuse<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A popular financial newsletter is accusing Roblox of allowing large-scale child sexual exploitation and inappropriate content on its platform, drawing on years of media reports. The allegations are <a href="https://thebearcave.substack.com/p/problems-at-roblox-rblx-4">detailed in <em>The Bear Cave</em></a>, a short selling newsletter — but Roblox says <em>The Bear Cave’s</em> founder is highlighting rare instances of abuse to profit by making the service look bad.</p><p>“This article contains misleading, irresponsible and in many cases false accusations about Roblox to further the author’s motives as a short seller,” Eric Porterfield, Roblox’s senior director of policy communications, told <em>The Verge</em>. “We reject the claim that child endangerment is a widespread or systemic problem on Roblox, and millions of people have a safe and positive experience on the platform every day.”&nbsp;</p><p><em>The Bear Cave</em>’s report lists 16 instances since 2020 in which adults were arrested or indicted for sexually exploiting children they met on Roblox, one of which involved a man who “groomed 150 children to engage in sexual activity” on the platform.<strong> </strong>It also discusses so-called “condo games” in which users simulate sex, as <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-60314572">previously reported by the BBC</a>. To be sure, these documented instances involve a small fraction of Roblox’s massive user base: the platform has more than 79 million daily active users, 42 percent of which are aged 13 or younger, <a href="https://venturebeat.com/game-development/roblox/">according to <em>VentureBeat</em></a>.</p><p>Porterfield told <em>The Verge</em> that Roblox continuously updates its safety practices to “catch and prevent malicious activity” on the platform, including by blocking inappropriate words and phrases in chat and not allowing image-to-image sharing. Roblox says the condo games are typically removed quickly — within minutes — and are hard for average users to find.</p><p><em>The Bear Cave</em>’s report also claims that Roblox hosts nonsexual inappropriate content, including games in which players reenact school shootings or the Holocaust. <em>The Verge</em> has <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/17/22628624/roblox-moderation-trust-and-safety-terrorist-content-christchurch">previously reported</a> reenactments of mass shootings, including the attack on mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand, on Roblox, and <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/roblox-online-games-irl-fascism-roman-empire/"><em>Wired</em> reporters have seen</a> Nazi role-plays on the platform. In August 2023, two California families <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/3/24120358/roblox-robux-illegal-gambling-online-casinos-lawsuit-section-230">sued Roblox</a> for allegedly allowing illegal gambling rings to prey on children on the platform. Roblox has unsuccessfully tried to get the charges dismissed.&nbsp;</p><p>Reports of inappropriate content on Roblox — sexual or otherwise — aren’t a new problem for the service, and they’re not necessarily surprising given its tens of millions of users. Still, it’s a particularly heated issue for Roblox at a time when legislators and advocates are debating just how much responsibility platforms have for child protection.</p><p>Roblox has been <a href="https://www.emergingtechbrew.com/stories/2024/05/16/roblox-kids-safety-legislation-ai">involved in lobbying</a> to shape <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24205393/kids-online-safety-act-minors-age-verification-kosa">the Kids Online Safety Act</a>, and its CEO, David Baszucki, traveled to Capitol Hill earlier this year to meet with legislators. “One of the things specifically with KOSA is that we want to make sure that when young people are learning to create and sharing their creations, for example, that doesn’t get turned off,” Baszucki said in an April interview with <em>Command Line</em>’s Alex Heath. “Or when there is organic learning on our platform or positive communication in some way, we don’t restrict it.”</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

But if you really consider yourself a masochist, you can always up the challenge by playing the game on ‘Captain’ difficulty—something the studio recommends you do if you’ve finished the game and wholly understand its complex rhythms and mechanics. As its own description says, here there’s no room for mistakes, and mounting catastrophes will spell your downfall without adequate planning and preparation. So let’s plan and get prepared!<br></p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="193831" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Week In Games: Octopath Dreamland Deluxe" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="226" data-playlist="193831,195410,196299" data-current="193831"><div><p>The Week In Games: Octopath Dreamland Deluxe</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/193831/193831_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/193831/193831_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/193831/193831_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/193831/193831_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/19283.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>After spending countless hours tearing my hair out playing<em> Frostpunk 2’</em>s most challenging difficulty setting, I have a few tips to share with you. Hopefully, by the end, you’ll find the confidence and know-how to excel at the end of the world!</p><h2 id="h160475"><a id=""></a><strong>Starting your settlement strong</strong></h2><p>Some people might immediately think the Captain difficulty in <em>Frostpunk 2</em> is too easy, but that line of thinking can lull you into a false sense of security. You want to walk into the scenario prepared. The first hour or so of your playthrough makes all the difference in the world.</p><p>Furthermore, I recommend starting on The Crater. It’s a compact map full of naturally occurring resources (with the exception of rich coal deposits), that will give you an excellent start.</p><figure id="" data-id="733b2fc14b108eac0404a3af602fcb1b" data-recommend-id="image://733b2fc14b108eac0404a3af602fcb1b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="It's The Crater, a settlement in the snowy landscape." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="It's The Crater, a settlement in the snowy landscape." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->11 Bit Studios / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="733b2fc14b108eac0404a3af602fcb1b" data-recommend-id="image://733b2fc14b108eac0404a3af602fcb1b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="It's The Crater, a settlement in the snowy landscape." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Here’s a starting build order to help you with the game’s most brutal difficulty setting:<br></p><ol data-type="List" data-style="Number"><li>In this scenario, you require five Housing Districts to cover the entire starting population, and it’s best to invest in a single upgrade for the Research Institute immediately.</li><li>Off to one side of The Crater, specifically, you’ll find several clusters of coal. You can easily fit three Extraction Districts here, but it’s enough to start with a single one.</li><li>Next, build another Extraction District up the cliff to acquire Prefabs and/or Materials. Keep in mind that you can expand down the line, so focus on covering as many nodes as possible with a single District.</li><li>You’ll want to plop down a Logistics District to explore Frostland, where you can find additional resources and manpower. To do that, start Frostbreaking toward the edge of the map, where you’ll spot a Logistics node.</li></ol><h2 id="h160476"><a id=""></a><strong>Research to prioritize on Captain difficulty</strong></h2><figure id="" data-id="9753113044ccb0981de29342afb887a0" data-recommend-id="image://9753113044ccb0981de29342afb887a0" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="It seems like it would be better to build a settlement somewhere a bit sunnier." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="It seems like it would be better to build a settlement somewhere a bit sunnier." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->11 Bit Studios / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="9753113044ccb0981de29342afb887a0" data-recommend-id="image://9753113044ccb0981de29342afb887a0" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="It seems like it would be better to build a settlement somewhere a bit sunnier." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>While the buildings you choose are crucial to your everyday survival, the research projects you select are equally important. The buffs from your chosen Ideas will determine your fate by increasing production, optimizing extraction, and spreading heat more efficiently. Here’s what to prioritize:<br></p><ol data-type="List" data-style="Number"><li><strong>Sawmills</strong>: In the early game, you must use resources wisely, which often means you can’t afford to build multiple Extraction Districts for materials and prefabs. But with a Sawmill upgrade, specifically a Mechanized Sawmill, you can increase materials production for a single slot, allowing a single District to act as two.</li><li><strong>Hothouses</strong>: Without food, you have no workforce. Without a workforce, you have no settlement. It’s a never-ending circle that requires sustenance, and Hothouses help feed the population by increasing food production at your Food Districts. While they require additional workforce and heat to operate, the expense is worthwhile.</li></ol><ol data-type="List" data-style="Number"><li><strong>Scouts’ Headquarters</strong>: Eventually, resources will run dry on your starting map, and despite exponential growth, you must continue pushing outward to survive. You’ll want to send teams out into the Frostland to seek resources and citizens to bring back via the Logistics District.</li></ol><p>With the right build order and technology, along with a careful, calculated approach, you’ll find that surviving <em>Frostpunk 2</em>’s most challenging difficulty setting is not only doable but approachable, too. Of course, it does help to have a few tips and a handy guide.
