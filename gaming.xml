		<p>Bloober Team has released the first gameplay trailer for its upcoming survival horror Cronos: The New Dawn, naming this trailer ‘Don’t Let The Merge.’ You can see why from the trailer as enemies can absorb other enemies to become bigger threats, with more powerful attacks and increased speed. The trailer also shows how you will navigate different locations, including some areas where gravity doesn’t have much of a pull.</p>
<p><iframe title="Cronos: The New Dawn | Official Gameplay Trailer |  DON'T LET THEM MERGE" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZblwGH-C7eg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/17/bloober-team-reveal-cronos-the-new-dawn/">Announced last October</a>, the behind the scenes video explores Cronos: The New Dawn’s setting, a post-apocalyptic rendition of 1980s Poland. This is the home to a survival horror adventure with some hefty helpings of sci-fi and time travel. You’ll play as a time-hopping Traveller, going back through time rifts to try and extract people who didn’t survive the apocalypse. Some of the most notable inspirations include the Dead Space franchise and the movie Twelve Monkeys. The Traveller’s own suit takes its inspiration from older deep sea diving suits, alluding to the theme of diving through time to save people.</p>
<p>Cronos: The New Dawn is set to launch in 2025 on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S.</p>

It is confirmed to be a day-one launch title on Xbox Game Pass which strongly suggests that it will be available for cloud gaming.</p></blockquote><p>When pushed for more evidence, as DM screenshots can be faked, the user shared a video showing the entire conversation and seemingly confirming that, yeah, the Xbox support account actually spilled the beans. Oops! </p><p>At first I wanted to chalk this up to a bot accidentally confirming info before it had been announced. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/Ser_Raven18/status/1912510613634379868&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/Ser_Raven18/status/1912510613634379868" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">But as pointed out by Raven on Twitter</a></span>, at least <em>one </em>of the messages seems to have come from a “live service agent” aka a human being. So maybe this is actually human error? Or a bot pretending to be a human made a very human-like whoopsie? </p><h2 id="h7986"><a id=""></a>We tried asking the Xbox support account for info</h2><p>After seeing the DMs, I decided to give it a shot myself and see what happened. I reached out to the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/XboxSupport&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/XboxSupport" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Xbox support account</a></span> and asked about <em>Oblivion </em>as well, and after a lengthy wait, a live service agent sent me this reply: </p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>Hello Zack, thank you for contacting Microsoft. Unfortunately, there is nothing officially announced regarding this matter. We will keep you updated using our social media channel.</p></blockquote><p>I didn’t give up that easy. Instead, I replied with “MENU” as I had done earlier. This had previously provided me with a bot and options to ask different questions about my Xbox account and games. However, this time, I didn’t get a menu. Instead a few minutes later another message from a live service agent popped up in my inbox. </p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p> At this time, there is no official information available regarding the release or availability of this title. We understand the excitement and interest, but as of now, nothing has been formally announced. We encourage you to keep an eye on Xbox’s official channels, including our website and social media platforms, for any future updates or announcements. As soon as there is confirmed information, it will be shared publicly through those outlets</p></blockquote><p>It seems the bot has been shut down and the live service agents running the account have been told to stop sharing details about a remaster that hasn’t even been announced yet. Anyway, it looks like we all might be playing <em>The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion</em> remastered next week on Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, and Game Pass.</p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/bloober-team-showcases-first-look-at-cronos-the-new-dawn-gameplay/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>After surprising everyone with its better-than-expected remake of <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/silent-hill-2-restless-dreams-town/">Silent Hill 2</a>, Bloober Team's next project, a brand-new game called <a href="https://wccftech.com/cronos-the-new-dawn-gets-deep-dive-from-bloober-team/">Cronos: The New Dawn</a>, looks like it's the next survival horror game players should keep their eyes on.</p>
<p>Bloober Team showcased our first honest look at gameplay from Cronos: The New Dawn in a new gameplay trailer, where fans of survival horror titles will see some similarities to popular games in the genre like Dead Space, but that's not to say Cronos: The New Dawn isn't doing anything new.</p>
<p>Like merging, for example. Enemies in Cronos: The New Dawn can 'merge,' meaning your job isn't done once you've shot an enemy dead. You need to burn the body. Otherwise, another enemy will take that dead bit of flesh on the ground and merge with it to make itself even stronger.</p>
<p>Suddenly, you're facing a bigger, badder enemy than you were before. If you keep letting enemies merge with the ones you thought you already took out, you can quickly find yourself in an even more terrifying situation. It's an additional layer of combat that means you'll always have to be on your toes between managing the enemies walking towards you and those you've already put down.</p>
<p><iframe title="Cronos: The New Dawn | Official Gameplay Trailer |  DON'T LET THEM MERGE" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZblwGH-C7eg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>In a press release, co-director and producer on Cronos: The New Dawn, Jacek Zięba, writes, "<em>Imagine this: a distorted mix of sci-fi, time travel, retro-futuristic dread, and body horror—all set against the gritty backdrop of&nbsp; 80s Poland. What a ride, right? And whatever you do… don't let them merge.</em>"</p>
<p>Co-director and designer Wojciech Piejko adds, "<em>How do you fight them? Fire! Burn the </em><br>
<em>fallen before they merge with living creatures. The merge changes the game, adding a </em><br>
<em>whole new layer of strategy to combat. Push your survival instincts to the max.</em>"</p>
<p>When we get our hands on Cronos, it'll be interesting to see how merging impacts combat, and what else the game has in store for survival horror fans. After all, Bloober Team has declared that it won't be making "<em><a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/bloober-team-claims-its-finished-making-shitty-games/">shitty</a></em>" games anymore.</p>
<p>Cronos: The New Dawn doesn't have an official release date yet, but we know it'll arrive on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S sometime in 2025. This means it'll be the studio's first new title to test that declaration.</p>

			<p>In today's new The Outer Worlds 2 video published as part of April's IGN First, Obsidian Entertainment revealed that the RPG sequel will feature 'way more expansive worlds' than the original (which is great news, as that was <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-outer-worlds-obsidian-never-changes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">one of my pet peeves with The Outer Worlds</a>). In classic Obsidian fashion, they will also be filled with fun stories and cool gear or collectibles to find.</p>
<p>Art Director Daniel Alpert explained:</p>
<p><em>We're definitely going more expansive than the first game. In the first game, we were very confined to smaller hubs and overland areas. Now that we're utilizing Unreal Engine 5, we can have way more expansive worlds. From point A to point B, there is a much larger territory that we can cover, and in between those areas, we have lots of little POIs (points of interest) that we can explore.</em></p>
<p>Game Director Brandon Adler added:</p>
<p><em>One of the very first things that we were targeting when we started The Outer Worlds 2 was to make these big, large, expansive areas. It's what players told us that they wanted the most. Working with Daniel and the other directors, we sat down and came up with a plan to how we were going to go do that. We made sure that we had big open sightlines and that we spent a lot of time and effort on making really cool-looking points of interest at a distance to really draw people and also maybe bring them off the beaten path a little bit. When they're heading over there, we made sure that as you're rounding corners or you're doing things like that, you see little points of interest. Another element that was also really important as we're kind of doing all of this stuff is making sure that it was very interesting when you get there, so we made sure that we blanketed all of our areas with just cool, fun stuff to go do, nice loot to go find, and cool stories to go unfold.</em></p>
<p><iframe title="The Outer Worlds 2: A Look at Its Expansive Worlds – IGN First" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fKj1UUIH0a4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Yesterday, IGN also <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/how-the-outer-worlds-2-lets-you-go-wild-with-rpg-character-building-ign-first" target="_blank" rel="noopener">posted</a> an interview that dived into the changes and improvements made to the underlying RPG formula of The Outer Worlds 2. The developers are trying to avoid a situation where by the end of the game, the main character is essentially good at everything. They're also removing respec to make sure that choices truly matter.</p>
<p>Lead systems designer Kyle Koenig said:</p>
<p><em>We would often see characters good at everything, which by the end of the game, minimized your personal experience with your character. We wanted to focus on making each individual level-up and investment really important. There's less confusion on when I should invest in one Skill or the other. If I want to be a player that's all about guns and using medical devices, I know which Skills I really need to care about. By having them separated and not in groupings, it lets characters be more specialized.&nbsp;By removing respec, we really incentivize it to be your experience. It is a part of your experience that no one else had, and I think that's really special about RPGs and something that respec tends to lessen.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>The Outer Worlds 2 will also feature a full-fledged stealth system, as <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-outer-worlds-2-gets-first-gameplay-video-and-info/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">revealed</a> last week. More info should be coming throughout April, though the big showcase is scheduled to air <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-games-showcase-set-for-june-8-the-outer-worlds-2-gets-direct-presentation-immediately-after/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">after the Xbox Games Showcase on June 8</a>. The game will launch on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X.</p>

                <p>Fortnite has been advertising heavily during WWE events this year despite the fact that there hasn't been any real WWE presence in the game in a while, leading pretty much everyone to assume a new collab was on the way. And it turns out that assumption was right, as reputable leakers are reporting that Cody Rhodes and The Undertaker will be the next wrestlers to be immortalized as Fortnite skins.</p><p>This isn't one of those not-so-credible "I'm hearing this is might happen sometime in the next few years" leaks like last week's Jack Black and Kingdom Come: Deliverance rumors. No, this leak comes with a release date (Friday) and prices (2800 V-Bucks for the full bundle), and was reported by <a href="https://x.com/Loolo_WRLD/status/1912508694811595040" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">multiple</a> <a href="https://x.com/iFireMonkey/status/1912511287680004589" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">different</a> sources simultaneously--it's quite credible.</p><p>In addition to the Cody Rhodes and Undertaker outfits, the set will include the Undertaker's urn and the American Nightmare mantle back blings, along with the Cody's Cutlass and Taker's Shovel pickaxes, an American Nightmare wrap, and emotes for both Cody Rhodes and Undertaker. The whole set will be included in a bundle for 2800 V-Bucks, and every item can be purchased separately if you only want a specific item or two. We don't have images for any of this yet--these items <a href="https://x.com/Loolo_WRLD/status/1912521107078275534" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">will be decrypted on Thursday afternoon</a>.</p><p>This set represents the third wave of WWE collaborations with Fortnite. The first added John Cena all by his lonesome back in 2022, and then a year later we got Bianca Belair and Becky Lynch as well. The expansion of WWE's roster into Fortnite then paused until this week.</p><p>Fortnite has been overflowing with collaborations in 2025, starting in January with Hatsune Miku and Godzilla x Kong, and continuing with new skins from Kaiju No. 8, Jujutsu Kaisen, James Cameron's Avatar, Mortal Kombat, Cowboy Bebop, Invincible (including a free Dupli-Kate), Tomb Raider, Walking Dead, and Adventure Time--not to mention <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/fortnite-festival-music-pass-all-songs-and-rewards-including-sabrina-carpenter-skin/2900-6417/" data-ref-id="2900-6417">Sabrina Carpenter</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/one-of-the-best-baseball-players-in-the-world-might-be-hitting-the-fortnite-shop-soon/1100-6529993/" data-ref-id="1100-6529993">Shohei Ohtani</a>, and Clix joining the Icon Series. All this--plus these new WWE skins and a rumored Star Wars season on the horizon in May--make it seem as if these collabs are not slowing down even a little bit.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-unveils-limited-edition-doom-the-dark-ages-controllers-and-console-wrap<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
In anticipation of Doom: The Dark Ages imminent arrival, Microsoft has unveiled a selection of limited edition Xbox accessories, including a wireless controller sporting the sleek, blood-spattered hues of the Doom Slayer.
</p>
<p>
Starting with the controller, its body, buttons, and directional pad are all chest plate green, while its right thumbstick has been coloured red to match the Doom Slayer's augmented nipple - or "chest port" as Microsoft insists on calling it. That's alongside "silver-plated sheathing" for the grippy bits, and "3D silver helmet spikes" surrounding the Xbox guide button.
</p>
<p>
It's a pretty nifty looking thing, and <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/d/xbox-wireless-controller-doom-the-dark-ages-limited-edition/8mzbmmcjzqc0#footnotes-uidfbe7">costs £74.99/$79.99 USD</a> - which includes the Doom Slayer Executioner Skin DLC for Doom: The Dark Ages. It's available to purchase exclusively from the Microsoft Store until 18th April, after which it'll be making its way to other retailers.

<p>
Fans of the Xbox Elite Series 2 have their own option, with Microsoft also announcing a Doom: The Dark Ages variant of its premium controller. This one's a little more subdued, featuring a black body, maroon buttons and sticks, plus a final nosebleed flourish. Sure the giant red Mark of the Slayer in the middle looks a bit naff, but you can't have everything. This one <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/d/xbox-elite-wireless-controller-series-2-doom-the-dark-ages-limited-edition/8mzbmmcjzqkt">costs £179.99/$199.99</a> and is available from 25th April - although you can pre-order it now.
</p>
<p>
And finally, the Mark of the Slayer returns for a limited edition Xbox Series X wrap designed to resemble a sort of crumbling, blood-spattered stone obelisk. It also includes some eye-catching innards, scrawled with "unspeakable inscriptions and symbols from the deepest levels of Hell". It's compatibile with disc and all-digital Series X consoles and <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-gb/d/xbox-series-x-wrap-doom-the-dark-ages/8mzbmmcjzqbx">costs £49.99/54.99 USD</a>. Both the Doom: The Dark Ages wrap and Elite Series 2 controller are exclusive to the Microsoft Store. And if any of these takes your fancy, you'll <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/04/16/doom-the-dark-ages-accessories-controller-console-wrap/">find more details here</a>.
</p>
<p>
As for Doom: The Dark Ages itself, it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/doom-the-dark-ages-gets-release-date-confirmed-will-make-you-feel-like-an-iron-tank-rather-than-the-fighter-jet-acrobatics-of-doom-eternal">launches for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC on 15th May</a>. It's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hands-on-with-doom-the-dark-ages-reveals-another-reinvention-but-one-that-feels-less-cleanly-defined">looking promising too</a>, with Eurogamer's Robert Purchase calling it a "bold reimagining [and] a brave departure" earlier this year.

            <title><![CDATA[A Real Museum Worker’s Take On Two Point Museum]]></title>
            <link>https://aftermath.site/two-point-museum-curator-review-realism</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/a-real-museum-worker%E2%80%99s-take-on-two-point-museum.1166007/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/two-point-museum-curator-review-realism<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I’m not a rollercoaster tycoon or a football manager but I do work in a museum, so, naturally, the recent game <a href="https://aftermath.site/two-point-museum-review-impressions" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Two Point Museum</em></a> grabbed my attention. It’s a tumultuous time for my field: I’m in the UK, where the arts are still recovering from the impact of covid, after struggling with dwindling funding during 14 years of successive Conservative governments. The recently elected Labour government are yet to turn the taps back on, so budget cuts and job losses are rife in organisations across the country.&nbsp;</p><p>Then there is the seemingly never-ending culture war. Museums find themselves in the middle. The right hates us for being too “woke” and wasting public money. The left (more reasonably) criticise issues such as the colonial roots of many collections or unethical sponsorship deals, such as those with fossil fuel companies. Meanwhile across the world, Donald Trump recently issued an executive order targeting “<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/mar/30/smithsonian-institution-trump-executive-order" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">anti-American ideology</a>” within the Smithsonian, museums face strict government censorship in China, voices advocating for Palestine are silenced almost everywhere, and no one seems to have enough money.&nbsp;</p><p>Understandably then, at many museums and arts organisations, relationships between workers and management can be strained. Management face financial and political pressures and have to find ways to keep things going, keeping funding bodies and trustees happy in the process. Workers feel taken for granted, always asked to do more with less, and worry that their job might be at risk whenever there is a new round of cuts. In my own workplace I’m a union rep, so these are issues that I experience first-hand.</p><p>With all of that in mind, why not recreate the experience at home? For… fun?</p><p>Thankfully, <em>Two Point Museum</em> is genuinely very engaging, quickly dragging you into its rewarding gameplay loop as you grow your museum collection and obsess over how to arrange it. I’m enjoying my time with the game, even as it brushes up against real-life issues. But I wondered if, given my real-life experience, could I run my museum better than my actual museum directors? Could I create a workers’ paradise and decolonise my collection while balancing the books and drawing in the paying public?</p><p>The short answer is no, because my staff keep getting severely injured while they travel the world taking whatever objects they like home with them.</p><p>For the purposes of this piece, I’m going to focus on the game’s “pre-history” museum. The game starts you here, and it’s one of the more realistic venues, modelled on the type of natural history museum found across the Western world and full of displays of dinosaur skeletons, fossils and other artefacts. Certainly it’s a little closer to reality than the game’s “supernatural” museum, where you rip ghosts from the “netherworld” and imprison them for the entertainment of the viewing public. There’s an unfortunate echo of the “human zoos” of the late 19<sup>th</sup> and early 20<sup>th</sup> centuries<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/history/interactive/2023/maura-philippines-smithsonian-brain-collection/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> there</a>, where colonised peoples were put on display for White audiences in Europe and North America. (In <em>Two Point Museum</em>, your ghosts simply leave if they decide they no longer like their accommodations, terrorising visitors on the way out.)</p><p>Staffing was my first concern. For obvious reasons, the game streamlines museum jobs, leaving you with Experts, Assistants, Janitors and Security Guards. My own real-world job – writing, editing and producing what’s referred to within the industry as the interpretation materials (labels, leaflets, audio guides, that sort of thing) – is reduced to purchasing readymade Info Stands, which feels a little insulting. Experts are a combination of curator, conservator and tour guide, with the added bonus of leading Expeditions to secure objects for your museum.&nbsp;</p><p>Once I’ve hired some staff, I need some actual stuff to go on display. Typically, a museum begins with an existing collection, rather than going out finding things one at a time. The British Museum started with Sir Hans Sloane, who amassed a collection of over 70,000 objects including books, artworks, and natural history specimens. All of this was bequeathed to King George II on Sloane’s death. In the US, the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City was built around the collections of people such as Henry Gurdon Marquand and Luigi Palma di Cesnola. Given the time period, these museums are often intrinsically linked to colonialism.&nbsp;</p><p>Looking at the British Museum, there are high profile examples of objects that were straightforwardly looted, such as the Benin Bronzes, seized during an attack by British Forces on Benin City. Then there are cases such as the Parthenon Sculptures, often referred to as the Elgin Marbles. These were legally acquired by Lord Elgin in the early 19<sup>th</sup> century; however, he was dealing with the Ottoman Empire, which ruled over Greece at the time, and Greece would like the sculptures back. </p><p>In the UK, it is illegal for the British Museum and other National Museums (those funded directly by the government, rather than an intermediary funding body) to remove objects from their collections outside of very limited circumstances. This means such a return would require a change in the law, which is possible but would be difficult and slow to achieve. (There is also easily identifiable hypocrisy in this area of law, as it is perfectly legal to return artwork stolen by the Nazis during World War Two, as the Tate gallery did in March this year.)&nbsp;</p><p>In <em>Two Point Museum</em>, the Expedition mechanic carries its own echoes of the colonial era. At my direction, my team of Experts are constantly Indiana Jonesing it around the world in the museum helicopter (we don’t have one of those at my work). Or, for a real-world example, they follow in the footsteps of former US President Theodore Roosevelt. In 1909, Roosevelt led an expedition through East Africa to ‘hunt specimens’ (i.e., kill animals) for the Smithsonian and the American Museum of Natural History. His team killed or trapped over 11,000 animals; regarding this number, Roosevelt <a href="https://www.arcsinfo.org/news-events/entry/2222/teddy-roosevelt-shot-this-lion-107-years-ago-the-world-is-about-to-see-it-again" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stated</a> that “I can be condemned only if the existence of the National Museum, the American Museum of Natural History, and all similar zoological institutions are to be condemned.”</p><p>Along with dinosaur bones and fossilised insects, at one point an Expedition returned a frozen caveman. For fairly obvious reasons, human remains are another area of controversy in museum collections. It sounds grotesque, but it’s fairly commonplace; if you’ve ever been to see a display of Egyptian mummies, you were looking at human remains. Thankfully, this is an area where communities are able to reclaim from British museum collections (some remains are a little more recent than ancient Egypt), and museums today are much more considerate in how such things are displayed, if they are displayed at all.&nbsp;</p><p>I immediately put my caveman on display. Without making Expeditions, the game would be unplayable, and as that ethical bridge had already been crossed, why not continue? I’ve since read that apparently this caveman isn’t dead, and if you don’t maintain a cold environment, he unfreezes and runs amok in your museum (which I’m inclined to let happen, as it sounds funny).&nbsp;</p><p>Having compromised my ethics with the collection, perhaps there was more luck to be had with the staff and administration of the museum.&nbsp;</p><p>Hiring is a never-ending process in this game: As the museum grows, you need more staff across all roles. You might think that this is extremely obvious, but compared to reality it’s maybe even more unrealistic than the helicopter. In my video game museum, I hire people whenever I need them and, somehow, the money doesn’t seem to run out. The few times I’ve been low on funds, the speedy progression of in-game time means that entry fees and donations allow the bank balance to bounce back.</p><p>This also enables me to increase salaries whenever necessary. As staff gain experience, they expect a raise. Back in the real world, union reps spend long periods of time negotiating with management to achieve annual raises for staff, with the possibility of industrial action if we’re unhappy with the offer on the table. In the game, my team exist at my whim, and they should consider themselves lucky that I am a kind and benevolent leader.&nbsp;</p><p>I do everything in my power to look after my in-game team. As well as regular raises, I’ve built them a generous staff room, with free snacks and coffee (I even remembered to add a window, once I remembered I could). They receive regular training to aid their professional development. They’re even provided with trips to a medical spa resort, which I can’t say I’ve ever been offered by my employer. That said, I have also never gotten a tropical illness or been bitten by a poisonous snake in the line of duty. But surely they knew the risks when they signed up? Isn’t this what I pay them for?</p><p>But even with all of this, I can’t make them happy. I have a current objective to achieve 75% staff happiness, and no matter what I try, that number is stuck in the 60s. I increase everyone’s wages, I add more amenities to the staff room, I provide ample training opportunities. I even tell them when to go on breaks, as they don’t seem able to make these decisions for themselves. Even so, that 75% remains unachieved.</p><p>So, it seems I’ve become another bad manager, a leader who is out of touch with their staff and whose professional ethics are practically non-existent. But eventually, through my own efforts or just time and luck, I feel confident I’ll hit that 75% and move on with the game. It’s a remarkably stress-free experience, which is part of why I enjoy it.&nbsp;</p><p>I also enjoy my actual job, which is a luxury not everyone has, even if that is decidedly not stress-free. Where the game is simple and streamlined, the real thing is messy and complex. But this complexity is part of the reward, when you get a chance to dig in and really do the work, dealing with thorny issues from history and trying to figure out how to present them to the public. I ultimately wouldn’t trade my in-game role as the boss for the real thing.</p><p><em>Tom Emery is a curator and writer living in Manchester, UK</em>.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/steel-ball-run-jojos-bizarre-adventure"><h3>Steel Ball Run Is The Best JoJo’s Bizarre Adventure Part</h3></a><p>The Real Man’s World is a moment that’ll stick with me forever</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/the-pitt-hbo"><h3>The Pitt&nbsp;Isn’t&nbsp;Just Another Anxiety-Inducing Medical Drama</h3></a><p>In between instilling an appreciation for medical personnel, it’ll have you fujoshiing out</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/carlo-acutis-gamer-saint"><h3>The Politics, Theology, And Hype Behind The First Gamer Saint</h3></a><p>Teenager Carlo Acutis, set to be canonized at the end of this month, will be the Catholic Church's first millennial saint</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/next-project-in-frostpunk-universe-set-for-2027-release-and-11-bit-studios-is-working-on-a-new-ip-as-well<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/frostpunk">Frostpunk</a> developer 11 bit Studios has begun work on "the next project set in the Frostpunk universe", which it plans to launch "as early as 2027". </p>
<p>Eurogamer recently heard word of this new project from 11 bit CEO Przemysław Marszał, who was talking to me about the history of the studio, and about its future. Today, 11 bit has now confirmed the project in its latest <a href="https://ir.11bitstudios.com/en/news/11-bit-studios-boldly-invests-in-new-titles/">financial results</a>.</p>
<p>With two games released in the Frostpunk series already, and the series' recent second entry still on wobbly ground with the community - Steam reactions are currently "mixed" - I asked Marszał whether the series had, for the moment, run its course, or whether there was a future for it.</p>
<p>Marszał replied: "We totally believe in Frostpunk. We believe in that IP. We totally believe in that fantasy. I don't want to spoil it but I can tell you that in about two weeks, you will hear about something, so it's really soon. We totally believe in the IP and we will definitely work on the IP more."</p>

<figcaption>11 bit acknowledges that there's a lot of work still to do on Frostpunk 2.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IAqJIRw9RHE" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>He added: "On the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/frostpunk-2">Frostpunk 2</a> front, we are doing a lot of work right now. The patch is coming, the DLCs are coming, etc. We see the problems with the game, we know the strengths of the game, and we are working on that game. But that's not only it. Frostpunk is definitely one of our key IPs, key games, and we love the IP so, yeah, we will work on that more."</p>
<p>Incidentally, while we are still waiting for a release date more specific than "summer 2025" for the console versions of Frostpunk 2, I'd be surprised if the upcoming teased announcement was for it - not least because Marszał separately said during our conversation that "the console version is releasing very soon".</p>
<p>But this new Frostpunk game - could it be an expansion? - is not the only new project the Polish studio is currently working on. "We've started working on two other things," Marszał said. "One thing is connected to Frostpunk and one thing is something new. We totally believe we should do new things."</p>

<p>Frostpunk 2 was released last September and arrived to glittering critical reviews, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/frostpunk-2-review-a-sequel-of-consequence">my Eurogamer Frostpunk 2 review</a> included, but it struggled - and continues to struggle - to convince fans. "It is a mixed release for us," said Marszał. "We have a very good game, we have really awesome reviews from the press; then on the other hand, a lot of players aren't satisfied. There's a disconnection here. Then on the other hand, we had really awesome sales at the beginning with that game, but now the question is if those sales will be long-term, especially with the mixed reviews we have right now. We understand that it's a lot of work, still."</p>
<p>The mixed reaction to Frostpunk 2 highlighted a difficult second half of 2024 for 11 bit Studios which, at the end of the year, announced it had cancelled a full-scale game, Project 8, which it had been working on for several years. It's a game not much has been known about until now, but I have seen a video of it in action and spoken at length to Marszał about it. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/this-war-of-mine-developers-cancelled-project-8-revealed-a-risky-project-that-would-have-been-a-big-departure-for-the-studio">I can tell you all about Project 8</a> in a separate article.</p>

Get in the video game, loser - we're going to the future in order to shoot some tentacles in order to go to the past in order to save the future by soul-jacking people from 1980s Poland. Wait, let me rewind time and start afresh: here's a new overview trailer for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/cronos-the-new-dawn">Cronos: The New Dawn</a>, a sci-fi <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-horror-games">horror</a> from <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/silent-hill-2">Silent Hill 2</a> remakers Bloober Team. It's got a <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dead-space">Dead Space</a>-style suit that makes you look like either an enormous fly or a sewn-up bottom (delete as appropriate), and some manky environments that recall Bloober's last original production, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-medium">The Medium</a>. Quickly now, watch the trailer while I finish writing this article.

Phew, made it just in time! Announced last October, Cronos: The New Dawn takes place in a world marred by The Change, a cataclysm that appears to have reduced Earth to a spectral asteroid field. The remnants of humanity survive in fetching hexagonal glamping pods, while the ravaged cities are full of things with tendrils and teeth where the abdomens should be. 
</p>
<p>
You play a "Traveller" working for the "Collective", and your job is to search this fallen world for portals to 1980s Poland, where The Change is still taking hold. There, you must use your wholly unterrifying fold-out "Harvester" gauntlet to "extract the Essences" of people fated to die, allowing them to accompany you back to the future. Presumably this will be useful somehow.
</p>
<p>
This looks like Bloober's most combative offering yet - a sizeable step up from the largely plank-based melee of the Silent Hill 2 remake. Your arsenal ranges from a reassuringly brick-sized handcannon to a shotgun, an automatic rifle and a weapon that appears to make things implode. It looks like there are a few terrain puzzles that involve time-rewinding. It's not clear whether the bulk of the game is spent in the future, with the old-timey Poland bits serving as climactic interludes, or whether you'll be running and gunning through the 1980s as well.
</p>
<p>
The thing that interests me most about Cronos is that it continues Bloober's curious dissection of their own cultural context, as they unpack Poland from different temporal vantages by way of different horror subgenres. Their breakthrough cyberpunk chiller <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/observer">Observer</a> took place in an apartment block in Kraków - Bloober's home town. The Medium, which is set in 1999, begins in the same apartment block. I wouldn't be surprised if the old lady's home from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-silent-hill-2-remake-devs-new-horror-game-is-a-time-travelling-jaunt-through-apocalyptic-eastern-europe">the first Cronos: The New Dawn trailer</a> was that very same apartment block again. Anyway, the new game is out this year and you can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2101960/Cronos_The_New_Dawn/">read more on Steam.</a>

      </div>
<p>The alpha test requires all players to have a Bungie.net account, and presumably the full release will, as well. A PlayStation Plus or Xbox Live account is not required to play the alpha test, but will be once Marathon officially launches. Friend invites are not supported during the alpha, although friends will be able to group up with each other if they were selected participants.</p><p>The alpha is approximately 6GB and only supports the English language. However, Bungie plans on supporting the full game with many additional languages. Additionally, account progress from the alpha will be deleted from test servers when they're closed and will not be saved for launch.</p><p>Marathon launches on September 23, and will support both cross-play and cross-save. While Marathon won't be full price, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marathon-wont-be-full-price-though-bungie-says-it-will-be-a-premium-title/1100-6530835/" data-ref-id="1100-6530835">it'll be a premium title</a>, with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bungies-marathon-will-be-40-report/1100-6526561/" data-ref-id="1100-6526561">reports that it'll be $40</a>.

            <p>Bloober's forthcoming survival horror Cronos: The New Dawn has received a fresh trailer to give a proper look at gameplay and its unique merge mechanic.</p>
<p>Cronos is the Polish studio's all-new original survival horror, following its success last year remaking <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/silent-hill-2">Silent Hill 2</a>.</p>
<p>The trailer, below, introduces the game's apocalyptic setting of 1980s Poland, hinting at story details and warning players of enemies that merge.</p>

<p>Downed enemies must be completely destroyed using fire. If not, existing enemies can merge with them to evolve into deadlier versions with new abilities.</p>
<p>This is one of the game's core combat mechanics, which co-directors Jacek Zięba and Wojciech Piejko hinted at when I spoke to them last year about Cronos, comparing it to Dead Space's limb shooting and Alan Wake's flashlight.</p>
<p>As for the story, it's set across two time periods as a mysterious Traveller from a dystopian future is sent back to the 1980s to discover the truth of its apocalypse.</p>
<p>The Polish setting is inspired by the real-life Nowa Huta district of Krakow, here seen as brutalist architecture warped by strange time anomalies.</p>
<p>There's no specified release date yet, but Cronos: The New Dawn is due for release this year across PC, PS5 and Xbox Series X/S.</p>
<p>For more on the game, check out my interview with the co-directors about <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/how-bloober-is-following-silent-hill-2-with-its-first-original-survival-horror-cronos-the-new-dawn">how Cronos will be a worthy follow-up to Silent Hill 2</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

CD Projekt has warned fans of a <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-witcher-4">The Witcher 4</a> beta test "scam" currently doing the rounds, saying it's "been taking the necessary steps to take this fraudulent messaging down".
</p>
<p>
The studio <a href="https://x.com/thewitcher/status/1912514283847504311">shared its warning to the Witcher community in a statement posted to social media</a>, writing, "Recently, we've been getting reports from some community members that they've been invited to a beta test of The Witcher 4 - this is a scam!"
</p>
<p>
"We've been taking the necessary steps to take this fraudulent messaging down. That said, if you receive any invites to or stumble upon news of one, we kindly ask you to report the scam using the tools available to you in your email client or the social media platform you are using."

Word these Witcher 4 beta test invites are fraudulent won't be much of a surprise, of course, given the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ciri-as-witcher-4-protagonist-really-really-interesting-for-all-kinds-of-reasons-says-geralt-voice-actor">Ciri-fronted game</a> was only <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-witcher-4-gets-its-a-first-trailer-and-yes-ciri-is-the-star">formally unveiled last December</a> and isn't <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-witcher-4-wont-be-out-until-after-2026-so-could-it-be-a-next-generation-game">set to release until sometime after 2026</a>. But as CD Projekt says, "Remember: professional monster slayers don't fall for scams; they see right through them and slay them!"
</p>
<p>
That doesn't, however, mean beta initiatives are completely out of the question further down the line. "Should we ever organise any beta tests in the future," the studio adds, "you will hear about it first, as always, via our official social media and websites."
</p>
<p>
As confirmed last November, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-witcher-4-has-entered-full-scale-production-cd-projekt-confirms">The Witcher 4 is now in full production</a>, but it's not the only title currently in development at CD Projekt - and the studio recently <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cd-projekt-shares-witcher-and-cyberpunk-project-updates-announces-partnership-with-mobile-developer-scopely">shared updates on its other projects</a> as part of its financial earnings report. Witcher spin-off Project Sirius remains in pre-production, for instance - although <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/witcher-spin-off-developer-the-molasses-flood-has-been-absorbed-into-cd-projekt-red">The Molasses Flood has now been folded into the main studio</a> - and the Witcher 1 remake, announced in October 2022, is still at the concept phase.
</p>
<p>
Away from The Witcher, CD Projekt's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a> sequel - currently known as Project Orion - was said to be entering pre-production "in the coming weeks".

			<p>A new Indiana Jones and The Great Circle video shared online today compares all console versions, highlighting how the Xbox Series X version is closer to the PlayStation 5 Pro version than the base model release.</p>
<p>The video shared on YouTube by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@brazilpixel" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Brazil Pixel</a> takes a good look at the Xbox Series X, PlayStation 5, and PlayStation 5 Pro versions of the game, showing an early game sequence running on all systems while keeping track of the performance, which is rock solid on all three systems in terms of frame time and frames per second, and the render resolution. While the PlayStation 5 Pro version obviously runs at the highest resolution, native 4K most of the time, the Xbox Series X doesn't lag too far behind, having a smaller gap with the PlayStation 5 Pro version than with the base PlayStation 5 version, which is made more impressive by the console's power usage.</p>
<p><iframe title="Indiana Jones and the Great Circle - Xbox Series X vs PS5 vs PS5 Pro - FPS and Resolution Test" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/itCYV8m04Fc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>There was no doubt that Indiana Jones and The Great Circle would run best on PlayStation 5 Pro, considering it is the most powerful console available on the market. Besides running at native 4K resolution most of the time, this version of the game comes with some <a href="https://wccftech.com/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-playstation-5-pro-global-illumination-improvements/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">enhancements</a> over the other systems, which include light global illumination, ambient occlusion, and contact shadows improvements.</p>
<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-indiana-at-his-finest/">Indiana Jones and The Great Circle</a> is now available on PC, Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S. The game is now available on PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 5 Pro for owners of the Premium Edition, and will release for everyone else later today.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-outer-worlds-2s-worlds-are-going-bigger-%E2%80%93-ign-first.1165878/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/the-outer-worlds-2s-worlds-are-going-bigger-ign-first<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">“One of the very first things we were targeting when we started The Outer Worlds 2 was to make these big, expansive areas. It's what players told us they wanted,” game director Brandon Adler told me when talking about how the team at Obsidian built the open regions for this sequel. But bigger doesn’t always mean better, and they seemed aware of that when creating the more expansive zones across the different planets and moons you’ll visit in The Outer Worlds 2. There appears to be a focus on rewarding exploration, creating dense environments, and designing areas that pull you in specific directions to investigate points of interest off in the distance. So, while it’s structurally similar to the original where you visit distinct open areas through the main quest, there’s a greater sense of scale this time around.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I was able to see some of these ideas in action with a gameplay tour of Golden Ridge, a new open region on the planet-moon Dorado that you’ll visit early on in The Outer Worlds 2. It’s an arid, desert-like region with trench lines from a war that broke out in the past, mining facilities run by a faction called The Protectorate, and a ton of hostile wildlife mutated from the polluted environment. Art director Daniel Alpert spoke about maintaining the first game’s decorative art nouveau and retrofuturistic inspirations, but going with something a bit more harsh for Golden Ridge. “We were able to pull from areas of the late old West to World War 1 and imbue the areas with little touches – you’ll notice a trench warfare line, and if you go a little further into a town, you'll still find that frontier colony vibe,” he said when working on Golden Ridge.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The Outer Worlds 2 - Golden Ridge Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Adler spoke to how the art direction feeds into the stories they’re trying to tell, specifically on this planet: “Before we get into any area, we have deep conversations about the overall story, the factions and what they’re doing, and what's important to them. Asking things like, why was anybody in Golden Ridge?” He gave examples of collaborating with the art team to have a sort of synergy between aesthetics and the game’s purpose, saying “We’ll say like, we want the trench lines <em>here</em>, maybe for gameplay reasons, but talk about why it makes sense story-wise.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As any good RPG does, these kinds of stories are woven into the regions themselves, and Adler teased some of that, saying “I won't get into what happens at the beginning of Golden Ridge, but there's a big state change in the area when you first get there. It’s going to blow people away and make them really want to investigate what's happening.” That’s said to be indicative of the rest of the game, as he continued telling me, “You’ll see that throughout a lot of our areas as well. We try to do those types of things - let the players see big events that are happening pretty early and get them hooked into the area.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">With that foundation, the team wanted to pack the region with interesting things along the way with the main quest. “We made sure of that with big open sightlines and we spent a lot of time and effort on making really cool looking points of interest out in the distance to really draw players and really bring them off the beaten path,” Adler said. He referenced filling these areas with side quests, supporting characters, and smaller stories to unravel, similar to the first game. There seems to be a concerted effort in rewarding players with collectibles (like a new collection of tossball cards) and gear, even for exploring parts of the region that don’t really have a specific story or quest purpose. It’s an important piece to this style of RPG, of course, and something they were conscious of when it came to improving things from the first game, making sure all parts of the development team were involved in making that happen.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I also got to see the Zyranium Lab, which is an interior level on Golden Ridge, and it was impressive not just for its scale, but the ways in which I can see gameplay possibilities for how I approach these kinds of games. In a similar vein as the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/new-gameplay-the-outer-worlds-2-ign-first">exclusive gameplay demo</a> I saw of the N-Ray Facility, I got the impression that levels like these are more intricately designed and drawing from immersive sims like Deus Ex and Dishonored. They’re larger and have multiple paths forward that look deliberate for a range of playstyles while still maintaining a focus on pulling the player in specific directions. “When we're building these more open spaces, we have a defined path that we want the player to go through. But in true Obsidian game style, we allow players to go everywhere and kind of experience whatever they want,” Adler said with regards to designing levels within the open regions.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>“One of the very first things we were targeting when we started The Outer Worlds 2 was to make these big, expansive areas. It's what players told us they wanted.”</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Golden Ridge was the only open region I was able to see, so I asked about what we can expect from the rest of the game’s worlds. Alpert told me, “We intentionally design each of our worlds to feel different from each other. It's a unique landscape every time you land on a new moon or new area. So it shouldn't be like, you go somewhere new and it's a little bit more of the same. These other areas are completely different from the last moonscape you just came from, and the next one you're going to be visiting is completely different as well.” While that may seem par for the course in a spacefaring journey like The Outer Worlds, the conscious effort to address the limitations of the first game and be more intentional about how its worlds are built makes me hopeful that the The Outer Worlds 2 can be an evolution of how Obsidian designs its games and worlds. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">So, from what I’ve seen thus far, The Outer Worlds 2 looks promising on several fronts. The <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/how-the-outer-worlds-2-lets-you-go-wild-with-rpg-character-building-ign-first">reworked RPG elements</a> look like they’ve been made to be more distinct when it comes to the role-playing experience, and the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/new-gameplay-the-outer-worlds-2-ign-first">small snippets of gameplay</a> show better accommodation for specific playstyles. And taking a look at the open zone of Golden Ridge gave not just a better sense of scale, but a natural sense of exploration with greater density and purposeful points of interest along the way. Soon, we’ll be diving deeper into combat design and the evolution of the Flaws system as part of IGN First exclusive coverage on The Outer Worlds 2, which also includes a conversation with original Fallout developer and creative director Leonard Boyarsky on how the first game was about establishing a new foundation for Obsidian and this sequel being the idealized version of that initial vision.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>
