<p>What if the <strong>Zelda</strong> series starred the Grim Reaper? What if it starred a pig? These are questions we all ask on a daily basis, right? Well, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/spindle">Spindle</a> is here to answer them.</p>
<p>This upcoming pixel art action adventure is set to arrive on the Switch eShop on <strong>13th October</strong>, and it looks really rather sweet. It boasts all the hallmarks of the Nintendo series that has so clearly served as a touchstone — puzzley dungeons, elemental bosses, a beach filled with nasty crabs — but with some added swine-based sweetness. What's not to like?</p>
<p>It's not all fun and games, mind you. Spindle dev Wobble Ghost doesn't use the ol' Grim Reaper lightly, and the story promises to navigate big themes like death, grief, and healing in your own way.</p>
<p>Here's a little more information on the game itself and a handful of screenshots from publisher Deck13:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>Spindle</strong></em> invites you to go on a lovingly hand-crafted journey that’s inspired by the games of our childhood, packed with <strong>charming characters and beautiful environments</strong>. With your scythe sharp and your wits even sharper, explore <strong>twisting dungeons filled with cunning foes and clever riddles</strong> as you unravel the mystery bit by bit. The deeper you go, the more the shadows seem to watch… ready to find out what’s <em>really</em> waiting in the dark?</p>
</blockquote>

<p>October is a particularly busy month for game releases, but this looks like it could fit the bill if you're after something sweet and sincere.</p>
<p><em>What do you make of Spindle? Let us know in the comments.</em></p></section></article><div><p>Jim came to Nintendo Life in 2022 and, despite his insistence that The Minish Cap is the best Zelda game and his unwavering love for the Star Wars prequels (yes, really), he has continued to write news and features on the site ever since.</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/authors/JimNorman"><span></span> Author Profile</a></li><li><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jimnormann.bsky.social"><span></span> Bluesky</a></li><li><a onclick="return replyTo('JimNorman');" href="https://www.nintendolife.com/#"> Reply</a></li></ul>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Just Cause&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Mad Max&nbsp;</em>developer Avalanche Studios has announced that it will be laying off some of its employees, and that it intends to close down its UK location.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://avalanchestudios.com/stories/studio-update" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">news update</a> on its official website, Avalanche says these layoffs are happening in order to "best ensure Avalanche Studios Group's long-term success", blaming "current challenges to [its] business and the industry".</p>

<p>The developer's UK location, which is based in Liverpool, will be closed, and staff reductions will also be happening at its Malmo and Stockholm offices, although Avalanche stops short of revealing exactly how many employees will be losing their jobs, or which departments the layoffs will hit hardest.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/avalanche-studios-layoffs-just-cause-4.jpg?itok=U8UnXseI 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/avalanche-studios-layoffs-just-cause-4.jpg?itok=071uBIfE 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Avalanche Studios is best known for the&nbsp;<em>Just Cause&nbsp;</em>series.</figcaption></figure><p>The studio closes by saying that its "immediate focus" is helping those who are losing their jobs, and that it remains "deeply committed to providing amazing games" to its "passionate player communities".</p>

<p>News of Avalanche Studios' layoffs and UK studio closure comes after reports that&nbsp;<em>Contraband</em>, the game the studio was working on for Xbox Game Studios, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/contraband-canceled-report-avalanche-studios" rel="nofollow">was canceled</a> as part of a wider wave of layoffs and cancellations at Microsoft.</p>

<p>That wave also hit the likes of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/everwild-canceled-rare-layoffs-report" rel="nofollow">Rare's&nbsp;</a><em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/everwild-canceled-rare-layoffs-report" rel="nofollow">Everwild</a>&nbsp;</em>and The Initiative's <i>Perfect Dark&nbsp;</i>reboot, with the latter's cancellation also <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/perfect-dark-reboot-canceled-developer-shut-down" rel="nofollow">resulting in the demise of the studio</a>.</p>

<p><em>Contraband</em>'s cancellation was, perhaps, not particularly surprising; the game was announced all the way back in 2021, and between then and its eventual shutdown, both Avalanche and Xbox were very quiet indeed about the project.</p>

<p>As far as we know, Avalanche Software isn't being hit by layoffs, although given the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/warner-bros-financials-2024-revenue-falls" rel="nofollow">dire time</a> Warner Bros. has been having in the gaming space recently, news of layoffs or closures wouldn't come as a surprise. Stay tuned for more on all things industry-related.</p>

              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/just-cause-3-the-kotaku-review-1745359451"><em>Just Cause</em></a> and <em>Mad Max</em> developer Avalanche Studios is closing up a studio in the United Kingdom and is laying off an undisclosed number of employees due to “current challenges to our business and the industry.”</p> <p>On September 30, <a href="https://avalanchestudios.com/stories/studio-update">Avalanche Studios Group posted a short update</a> on the company’s official site announcing that its UK development studio in Liverpool is being closed and that all employees will be “impacted.” Avalanche also confirmed in the same statement that layoffs are planned for its Swedish studios located in Malmö and Stockholm. The news of layoffs and a studio closure comes about two months after Avalanche and Xbox announced that the upcoming game <em>Contraband</em> was canceled.</p> <p>Here’s Avalanche’s full statement as posted online:</p> <blockquote><p>In light of current challenges to our business and the industry, we have thoroughly reviewed how to best ensure Avalanche Studios Group’s long-term success. This review has led us to the difficult conclusion that we must make changes to our staffing and locations. As a result, we are proposing to close our Liverpool studio, and to initiate a collective consultation process, as required by UK law. This will impact all Avalanchers in Liverpool. The changes will also impact our other studio locations in Malmö and Stockholm, where we will reduce our workforce and restructure the teams to address our games’ needs.</p> <p>Our immediate focus is to offer full support to all Avalanchers during this challenging time. Despite these changes, we remain deeply committed to providing amazing games to our passionate player communities.</p></blockquote> <p><em>Contraband</em> was first announced back in 2021 and was going to be published by Xbox and developed primarily by Avalanche’s studio in Liverpool. However, four years later, we had heard very little about the game and its status. <a href="https://kotaku.com/just-cause-makers-xbox-exclusive-contraband-canceled-amid-recent-cuts-2000616371">In August 2025</a>, Xbox and Avalanche announced what most people expected: Development on <em>Contraband</em> was being halted as the studio “evaluated” the future of the game and its plans moving forward. And while the game isn’t mentioned directly in the statement above, it appears those involved with the evaluation have settled on layoffs.</p> <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/candy-crush-ai-king-microsoft-layoffs-xbox-farm-saga-1851786283">This is just one</a> of <a href="https://kotaku.com/game-industry-layoffs-how-many-2024-unity-twitch-1851155818">many, many, many layoffs</a> to <a href="https://kotaku.com/latest-round-of-mass-layoffs-at-xbox-begin-with-200-job-1851785492">happen in the video game industry</a> over the last few years as it becomes more expensive to develop bigger games and harder than ever to get people to play them, as titles like <a href="https://kotaku.com/old-games-2023-playtime-data-fortnite-roblox-minecraft-1851382474"><em>Fortnite, GTA Online, Call of Duty, </em>and <em>Roblox</em></a> dominate the charts. <a href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-netease-game-director-layoffs-season-2-1851765290">And even if your game is a big hit</a>, <a href="https://kotaku.com/oblivion-remastered-virtuos-layoffs-cyberpunk-patch-1851786435">that doesn’t mean you’re safe.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Carin, the survival mountain climbing game set to release on November 4, has been delayed to Q1 2026. The game was <a href="https://gameinformer.com/sgf-2024/2024/06/07/cairn-is-a-new-climbing-adventure-survival-game-from-the-developers-behind">first revealed</a> during Summer Game Fest 2024.&nbsp;</p><p>Developed by The Game Bakers, the creators of <a href="https://gameinformer.com/games/furi/b/playstation4/archive/2016/07/14/a-stylish-fight-with-frustration.aspx">Furi </a>and <a href="https://gameinformer.com/review/haven/haven-review-love-conquers-some">Haven</a>, Cairn centers on protagonist Aava embarking on an expedition to climb the perilous Mount Kami. The game features realistic climbing mechanics and physics, as players must carefully manage their tools and resources (like food and water) to gradually work their way towards the summit.</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fZiy36vcB5Q"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fZiy36vcB5Q" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>The Game Bakers says that although Cairn is content complete, it needs a few more months to focus on optimization, debugging, and overall polish. “We have been running a lot of playtests, and the feedback from players is that we have something truly special with Cairn. We also see all the improvements we can still do to make the experience unforgettable. After 5 years of work, it makes no sense to rush it, we want to be proud of the game we launch,” explained creative director Emeric Thoa.</p><p>Although Cairn has no new release date, the game’s well-received <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1588550/Cairn/">Steam demo</a> will be updated on October 13, which will allow players to see the “ghosts” of other players climbing alongside them. Players can race against these specters, or follow them to find hidden paths, but this feature will only be available for a limited time. A new trailer shows off this update below.</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ko_d5JyQNKM"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ko_d5JyQNKM" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>When Cairn launches next year, it will be available on PlayStation 5 and PC.&nbsp;</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/2025/09/30/survival-mountain-climbing-game-cairn-delayed-to-2026]]></content:encoded>

</div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Roblox has been criticised for its new guidelines on "sensitive issues", described by advocacy groups as "a step backward for both creative expression and social justice".</p>
<p>Back in August, Roblox introduced a <a href="https://devforum.roblox.com/t/updates-to-our-maturity-compliance-questionnaire/3860056">new content descriptor for sensitive issues</a> as part of an improvement to parental control. The descriptor is meant for Roblox experiences themed on social, political, or religious issues, but the company stated it is "not meant to take a stance on any specific issue".</p>
<p>That has now been opposed in an <a href="https://www.womeningames.org/robloxs-new-sensitive-issues-guidelines-a-threat-to-creative-expression-and-social-progress/">open letter to Roblox by advocacy groups</a> Women In Games, Out Making Games, and BAME in Games, each focused on supporting marginalised groups.</p>
<p>"Roblox's recently proposed creator guidelines regarding 'sensitive issues' represent a step backward for both creative expression and social justice," the open letter reads. "These changes threaten to undermine the vibrant, inclusive creative community that has flourished on the platform since 2006, while potentially causing real harm to marginalised groups in society."</p>
<p>Essentially, the letter argues, by introducing these descriptors Roblox is treating issues of equality and human rights as "debatable rather than fundamental".</p>
<p>Roblox's criteria for the descriptor applies to "experiences where a majority of the content, gameplay, or experience details…refers to the sensitive issue", which can include immigration, capital punishment, gun control, marriage equality, pay equity in sports, racial profiling, reproductive rights, and more.</p>
<p>"We support efforts to keep children safe online - especially girls, who face disproportionate harassment and grooming," the open letter continues. "But safety cannot be achieved by silencing content that educates and empowers.</p>
<p>"Issues such as equal pay, reproductive rights, and gender equality are central to girls' and women's lived experiences. Marking these as 'sensitive' risks hiding content that is vital to representation, education, and inspiration."</p>
<p>Suppressing such experiences, the advocacy groups claim, is "false neutrality" and instead of protecting children, "the policy risks teaching Roblox's diverse audience that issues of justice and equality are controversial opinions rather than universal values, thereby reinforcing the very divisions it claims to guard against."</p>
<p>Instead, the groups believe Roblox should rely on internationally recognised age-rating systems like PEGI and the International Age Rating Coalition (IARC), instead of "invent[ing] a vague, easily abused 'sensitive issues' label".</p>
<p>Eurogamer has contacted Roblox for its response to the open letter.</p>
<p>Back in July, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/roblox-introduces-new-safety-features-including-an-ai-to-estimate-a-teenagers-age-through-video-selfies">Roblox also introduced new safety features</a>, including an AI used to estimate a user's age through video selfie. Earlier this month, it announced this would be <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/roblox-continues-efforts-for-child-safety-by-expanding-age-estimation-to-all-users-by-end-of-the-year">expanded to all users by the end of the year</a>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Q-UP Is An Esport About How Ridiculous Esports Are]]></title>
            <link>https://aftermath.site/qup-esports-universal-paperclips</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/q-up-is-an-esport-about-how-ridiculous-esports-are.1312423/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Q-UP</em> (a game whose title I literally just got while typing this sentence, humiliatingly) is the latest from the folks behind numbers-go-up game <em>Universal Paperclips</em>. It’s a sendup of esports, both the industry surrounding them and what the sweatiest players demand of them. It’s got a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3730790/QUP/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">demo</a> out now on Steam; I played it for an hour on Saturday morning and… did well? I have no idea, because I didn’t really <em>do</em> all that much, even though I made all the numbers go up like a damn pro.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Q-UP TRAILER" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6xxKP9pf-20?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>The esport at the heart of the game, which you can play with bots or actual people, is a coin flip; you’re sorted on to team Q or team UP, and if your side of the coin comes up three times, you win. This esport bills itself as “fast, fun, fair,” with its fake developer writing that “Just like you, we’re sick and tired of the status quo of contemporary esports–long wait times, grueling games against mismatched opponents, and a ranking system that doesn’t accurately reflect the time and energy you’ve invested in the game.” There’s a meta-fiction surrounding all this, told through a fake news feed and fake emails, hyping up leagues and backend improvements and your own performance, all of it having so little to do with you actually sitting there watching a virtual coin spin around that I started to wonder if I'd ever actually done <em>anything</em> meaningful in a competitive game. </p><p>Unlike a round of <em>Fortnite </em>or <em>Overwatch</em> where the match is the actual game, what of <em>Q-UP </em>can be called a game happens in the interim. Your inbox starts filling up with emails from the game’s fictional developers, hinting at longer storylines. You earn a head-spinning amount of XP and points and currency in matches. Some of this you can apply to skills, which add effects when you win or lose or start a match, and some of which synergize based on where they are in the skill tree’s geometrically-based layout. There’s also a ton of items, purchased with in-game currency, that can boost your outcomes. At first, I totally thought all of this was fake, since it sat atop a baffling pile of jargon and conditions and relationships. And while I’m still not <em>completely</em> convinced it’s all real, by messing around with my skills and items I was able to make any outcome in a match a huge payout and hit the level cap the demo places on you pretty swiftly. Even though I knew this was all bullshit, it was hard not to feel proud of myself as my points and currency and rank skyrocketed, all of it shown through hugely satisfying lists and tickers and feedback.</p><figure><figcaption>The skills screen</figcaption></figure><p>The game’s humor is largely aimed at the esports and games industries, sending up their aesthetics and self-importance and desperate desire to force "innovation" where none exists. (I hate-love a venture capitalist whose signature is literally a line-go-up chart.) Even when it teases esports players, it reserves its real ire for the powerful figures and their structures, which prevents it from stumbling into meanness, even if I do in fact deserve to be mocked for spending far too long messing with sliders that obviously didn't do anything just because a video game presented me with sliders. <em>Q-UP</em>'s world is compelling to hang out in even though it postures at being offputting, and its esport is somehow earnestly fun even though it is, again, just watching a fake coin flip. There’s no release date yet, but <em>Q-UP</em>'s Steam page says it’s “coming soon.”</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/the-ea-sale-is-bad-news-for-everyone"><h3>The EA Sale Is Bad News For Everyone</h3></a><p>Except--you'll never believe it--the guys who already have the money</p></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div><br/><br/>https://aftermath.site/qup-esports-universal-paperclips]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Avalanche Studios has confirmed that the studio will suffer layoffs across each branch in Malmö, Stockholm, and Liverpool, with Liverpool closing down and its entire staff laid off. The cuts come a little less than two months after Contraband, the <a href="https://wccftech.com/abalanche-studios-contraband-announced-for-pc-xbox-series-xs/">project it was working on since 2021</a> which was set to be an Xbox exclusive, was <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-reportedly-stopped-contraband-development-avalanche-studios/">cancelled as part of the massive cuts Microsoft made earlier this year</a>.</p>



<p>In a <a href="https://avalanchestudios.com/stories/studio-update">statement posted to its official website</a>, the studio known for its Just Cause games began by saying, "<em>In light of current challenges to our business and the industry, we have thoroughly reviewed how to best ensure Avalanche Studios Group's long-term success</em>."</p>



<p>"<em>This review has led us to the difficult conclusion that we must make changes to our staffing and locations. As a result, we are proposing to close our Liverpool studio, and to initiate a collective consultation process, as required by UK law. This will impact all Avalanchers in Liverpool. The changes will also impact our other studio locations in Malmö</em> <em>and Stockholm, where we will reduce our workforce and restructure teams to address our games' needs. Our immediate focus is to offer full support to all Avalanchers during this challenging time. Despite these changes, we remain deeply committed to providing amazing games to our passionate player communities</em>."</p>

<p>When Microsoft's massive <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-layoffs-funding-increased-spending-ai-infrastructure/">9,000+ layoff hit this past July as part of the company's increased focus and investment in its AI efforts</a>, it wasn't exactly clear if Contraband would be part of the same fallout that struck <a href="https://wccftech.com/perfect-dark-cancelled-the-initiative-shut-down-microsoft-layoffs/">Perfect Dark</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/rare-everwild-cancelled-microsoft-gaming-layoffs/">Everwild</a>, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/spencer-reportedly-loved-playing-zenimax-onlines-new-game-in-march-only-to-cancel-it-in-july/">ZeniMax Online's unannounced new MMO</a>.</p>



<p>That said, the Contraband trailer that announced the game in 2021 <a href="https://x.com/DestinLegarie/status/1942272038045122595">being set to 'private' on the official Xbox YouTube channel,</a> was certainly telling. The cancellation was confirmed a little more than a month after the initial wave of Microsoft layoffs broke.</p>



<p>When <a href="https://wccftech.com/contraband-a-ways-off-report-avalanche-shuts-down-multiple-studios/">Avalanche Studios laid off staff while it was still developing Contraband</a>, before we knew what the game's fate would be, at least we could hope the studio would muddle through because it had a project on the go. Now with Contraband gone and an entire branch of the studio shut down, it is a much bleaker picture for Avalanche Studios future.</p>



<p>Avalanche Studios has not commented on exactly how many developers are being laid off, and how many worked at its Liverpool studio. According to its website, Avalanche currently has a team of 600 developers across the three branches.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/yakuza-kiwami-3s-dark-ties-addon-was-originally-just-a-movie.1312417/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio has revealed that&nbsp;<em>Dark Ties</em>, the fully-fledged spinoff launching alongside&nbsp;<em>Yakuza Kiwami 3&nbsp;</em>in February, was originally intended as a movie before being expanded into a playable game.</p>

<p><i>Dark Ties&nbsp;</i>was announced <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/yakuza-kiwami-3-dark-ties-announced" rel="nofollow">alongside <i>Yakuza Kiwami 3&nbsp;</i>last week</a>; while <em>Kiwami 3&nbsp;</em>was&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/yakuza-kiwami-3-apparently-leaked" rel="nofollow">leaked via an accidental listing</a> on the developer's official website prior to the reveal, <em>Dark Ties&nbsp;</em>was a surprise. It's a spinoff that revolves around Yoshitaka Mine, a prominent character in the original&nbsp;<em>Yakuza 3</em>.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://www.famitsu.com/article/202509/53863" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Famitsu</a> interview (thanks, <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/yakuza-dark-ties-was-originally-supposed-to-be-just-a-viewable-movie-but-rgg-studio-couldnt-miss-out-on-its-last-opportunity-to-make-mine-playable/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Automaton</a>), game director Ryosuke Horii says that&nbsp;<em>Dark Ties&nbsp;</em>was supposed to be "something that could be viewed like a video", but that the "best way" to tell the expansion's story would be to allow players to play as Mine themselves.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/yakuza-kiwami-3-dark-ties-mine-cigarette.jpg?itok=YqWu-Q8y 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/yakuza-kiwami-3-dark-ties-mine-cigarette.jpg?itok=Lhs4ox6R 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Dark Ties&nbsp;</em>has been significantly expanded compared to its humble origins.</figcaption></figure><p>Additionally, Yoshitaka Mine is, according to series producer Hiroyuki Sakamoto, one of the franchise's most popular characters. Supposedly, he consistently places in the top five when polls are conducted to discover fans' favorites.</p>

<p>Given that&nbsp;<em>Yakuza 3&nbsp;</em>(and, now,&nbsp;<em>Yakuza Kiwami 3</em>) is Mine's only appearance, the team thought it was the right thing to do to make him playable rather than relegating him to a simple movie project.</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Dark Ties</em>, it's a spinoff of&nbsp;<em>Yakuza Kiwami 3&nbsp;</em>in which you'll play as Mine, discovering new side stories and a new "boxing-based combat" system that stand in contrast to Kazuma Kiryu's established fighting style.</p>

<p>Rather than being paid DLC,&nbsp;<em>Dark Ties&nbsp;</em>will launch alongside&nbsp;<em>Yakuza Kiwami 3</em>, and it'll be included with the main game at no additional cost.</p>




<p>As for&nbsp;<em>Yakuza Kiwami 3&nbsp;</em>itself, it's a remake of&nbsp;<em>Yakuza 3</em>, which takes us back to a younger Kiryu as he juggles his responsibilities to his orphanage and to the yakuza clan he's left behind.</p>

<p>You'll be able to check out&nbsp;<em>Yakuza Kiwami 3&nbsp;</em>when it launches on February 12th for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3937550/Yakuza_Kiwami_3__Dark_Ties/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10015219" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/yakuza-kiwami-3-dark-ties/9n2370ncnw1m" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/yakuza-kiwami-3-and-dark-ties-switch-2/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch 2</a>.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/ps5-pro-dualsense-controller-gamepad-battery-life-2000630240</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>When first-party video game controllers finally cut the cord to embrace their wireless future in the PS3/Xbox 360 era, Sony chose the path of built-in rechargeable lithium batteries over Xbox’s AA-battery solution. While rechargeable battery kits would become available for 360 controllers and beyond, Sony stuck to its built-in solution. It looks like that may be changing soon, however, if some leaks are to be believed.</p> <p>According to <a href="https://www.ppe.pl/news/384532/nowe-ps5-pro-i-kontrolery-dualsense-z-pozadana-funkcja-zdradzamy-szczegoly.html">Polish-language site <i>PPE</i></a>, credentialed leaker Graczdari has spilled the beans on an upcoming update to the DualSense controllers Sony plans to ship with <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/a-new-ps5-pro-model-has-been-leaked-and-its-releasing-soon/">a new, more energy-efficient PS5 Pro that seems to be on the horizon</a>. Grains of salt and all, this same leaker accurately called <i>Flight Simulator</i>’s arrival on Sony hardware and the physical release of <i>Oblivion Remastered</i>.</p>

 <h2>What kinds of batteries will this thing take?</h2> <p>According to the leak, this revised DualSense controller is referred to internally as “V3.” What isn’t as clear is whether or not you’ll be able to shove some Duracells in here and call it a day. Our <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/sony-is-reportedly-set-to-release-an-updated-ps5-dualsense-controller-with-a-removable-battery/">comrades over at <i>VGC</i></a> don’t seem to think so, as the language in the original report seems to suggest the batteries might be a separate product category of their own, perhaps not too dissimilar from Xbox’s rechargeable battery solution.</p> <p>PlayStation controller battery life has been a bit of a rollercoaster over the years. Veterans of the PS3 era will likely remember the DualShock 3 as being quite generous when it came to playtime. The DualShock 4, however? That battery would evaporate faster than water on Mars. The DualSense hasn’t been much of an improvement, especially with its more sophisticated rumble feature and triggers. Hopefully V3 of this otherwise very comfy controller will lengthen your time spent cordless.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ugreen-mac-mini-m4-dock-has-never-been-this-cheap-featuring-11-ports-and-8tb-expansion-at-giveaway-pricing.1312405/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>As great as Apple’s products are in the performance department, a huge part of their appeal has always been, well, they’re&nbsp;<em>cool looking</em>. The latest models of the longtime favorite Mac Mini – the M4 Mac Mini and M4 Mac Mini Pro — are no exception. But it’s a third-party accessory — the amazing UGREEN dock and stand — that is the best fit possible for the M4 Mac Mini for performance and expanded capability, and it passes the good-looks test. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4387/">It’s also at an all-time low price of $61 (32% off) ahead of Amazon Prime Big Deal Days.&nbsp;</a></p>
<p>The UGREEN dock and stand blends in with the M4 Mac Mini so seamlessly it looks like it’s part of the Mini itself, or at least an accessory built by Apple. But as a UGREEN product, it gives you that elegant look and outstanding performance at a fraction of the price Apple would likely charge.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4387/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Looks Aren’t Everything</h2>
<p>We’ve gone on long enough about the aesthetic superiority of the UGREEN Mac Mini Dock and Stand. Where it truly shines and massively overperforms its price is in what it brings to your Mini. Three additional USB-A ports at 10Gbps, two more at 5Gbps, two USB-C ports at 10Gbps, a SD and MicroSD card reader that reads and writes at a sizzling 170MB/s are instantly added to your M4 Mac Mini, all via just one unobtrusive USB-C connection to the Mini itself.</p>
<p>Then there’s the expansion opportunity — the UGREEN Mac Mini Dock and Stand has a “hidden” enclosure at the bottom of the unit that can hold an M2 NVMe SSD drive. The drive itself isn’t included (hello — $61!) but this gives you the option of adding as much as 8TB of storage to your Mini. PCI Express, NVM Express, and NVM3 M.2 drives are all compatible via an easy plug-and-play installation, and once it’s plugged in, the UGREEN dock moves data back and forth with the Mini at a staggeringly fast 10Gbps.</p>



<h2>Stand That Delivers</h2>
<p>The UGREEN covers details you wouldn’t normally consider, including conductive paint shielding for 5G avoidance and reducing Wi-Fi interference. There’s also a bottom groove in the stand for access to the power button, eliminating the only design flaw of the Mini itself — having to lift it up just to turn it on.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4387/">M4 Mac Mini users are getting a pre-Prime Day bonanza with this hot 32% off deal on the UGREEN dock and stand.</a></p>

              <p>Physical editions aren’t completely dead on Xbox. Chatbots are way too alive, unfortunately. And be still my beating heart<em>, Brotato</em> is coming back from the dead after 12 months without an update. Welcome to another edition of Morning Checkpoint, <em>Kotaku</em>‘s daily roundup of gaming news and culture. <em>Final Fantasy Tactics: The Ivalice Chronicles</em> is finally out today. <a href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-tactics-remaster-review-ivalice-chronicles-2000628040">Here’s my review from last week</a>. It’s excellent, and <a href="https://x.com/Food4Dogs/status/1972837272149233792">just like YouTuber Food4Dogs</a>, I’m in heaven this week.</p> <h2><em>Brotato</em> is coming back with new DLC</h2> <p><em>Brotato</em> is what you’d get if you combined<em> Vampire Survivors</em> and <em>The Binding of Isaac</em>. It’s a twin-stick roguelite shooter with lots of satisfying bullet hell action and a surprisingly satisfying buildcrafting journey. It came out of Early Access in 2023 and received two updates but has been radio silent for almost a year.</p>

 <p>Developer Blobfish has now handed the reins over to<em> The Rogue Prince of Persia</em> maker Evil Empire to continue <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2025/09/brotato-post-launch-development-moved-to-evil-empire">developing new content for it</a>, similar to what the latter did for<em> Dead Cells</em>. Its post-launch revival begins with a new update in October that will add, among other things, a new enemy called The Gobbler.</p>

The reveal comes soon after <a href="https://x.com/SEGA/status/1971432623227666537">a patch</a> for the game fixed the blurry resolution issue on Switch 1 and 2.

It’s also looking at <a href="https://x.com/KirPinkFury/status/1973005588016894122">establishing an entity in Thailand</a>.</p>

Will you be able to get it to curse like <em>Fortnite</em>‘s AI Darth Vader? Time will tell.</p>

 <p>Microsoft is also rolling out its <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/09/29/xbox-september-update-2025/">Gaming Copilot experiment</a> to players on PC and mobile. The chatbot is supposed to be able to scan what’s on your screen as you’re playing and answer any questions. Will it actually be helpful or just tell me to “git gud” in ever more elaborate ways? The jury’s still out on that one, too.</p> <h2>The<em> Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered</em> gets a cheaper physical release</h2> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">When you've cleared two goblin caves, an underwater shipwreck, and the entire town of Hackdirt, and you still can't remember where you picked this item up. 🤔 <a href="https://t.co/9hRi8t76LG">pic.twitter.com/9hRi8t76LG</a></p> <p>— The Elder Scrolls (@ElderScrolls) <a href="https://twitter.com/ElderScrolls/status/1972668194033693093?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 29, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>If you’re a fan of Bethesda RPGs and someone who prefers to collect games in boxes rather than on hard drives, you’re in luck.

Not only did Square Enix ship two "versions" of the game—one with updated visuals and voice acting, and one that faithfully recreates the original PlayStation title—but it did so with several veteran developers at the helm: director Kazutoyo Maehiro, art director Hiroshi Minagawa, and former scriptwriter Yasumi Matsuno.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">These men worked on the original </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Final Fantasy Tactics</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. That makes them a rare breed of game developer tasked with going back to their old work and reflecting on decades-old development decisions. They've been candid about the challenges, which included </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.square-enix-games.com/en_GB/news/final-fantasy-tactics-interview">rebuilding the lost source code</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and re-crafting systems by "feel" alone. Meanwhile former scriptwriter Yasumi Matsuno wrote fresh dialogue and scenarios, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.inverse.com/gaming/final-fantasy-tactics-the-ivalice-chronicles-interview">shining a light</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> on </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Tactics</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">' greatest legacy: its electrifying story of class warfare, corruption in the church, and government oppression.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It was an early example of how strategy games could be platforms for strong storytelling. Successors like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Fire Emblem Awakening</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Warcraft 3</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Marvel's Midnight Suns</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> have all won praise for investing in strong writing as well as tightly-paced strategic combat.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/how-yacht-club-games-is-staying-retro-with-its-most-ambitious-game" target="_self" data-discover="true">How Yacht Club Games is breaking new retro ground with Mina the Hollower</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Great games writing lives everywhere in games but the revival of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Final Fantasy Tactics </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">made us ask—what is it about the strategy genre, be it turn-based or real-time—that makes it such a robust canvas for writers?</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">We posed the question to Maehiro and Minagawa in a recent call discussing their work on </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Ivalice Chronicles</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. Their answer: it's all about the fundamentals of the genre.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="The number of characters you control can shape a game's story">The number of characters you control can shape a game's story</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Maehiro and Minagawa returned to a recurring theme during our conversation about the challenges of remastering and updating </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Final Fantasy Tactics</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">: the fundamentals of the game's design, from its square-based combat system to its cast of characters. Many of the player-controlled characters are unique soldiers, bowmen, and mages with bespoke sprites who have a role to play in the game's story. Others are generic fighters with customizable sprites who can either take the role of cannon fodder or be sharpened into units as strong as the main cast.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It's this mosaic that Maehiro said separates </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Tactics</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> from action games where you play as a single character. Though Ramza Beoulve is the protagonist, he's treated equally on the battlefield as his allies when it comes to control and gameplay. "In an action-based game, you have a character that you're controlling, and your [goal] is to defeat an enemy," said Maehiro. "I feel like that kind of puts you on rails for a certain type of storytelling. It's hard to weave in those external elements."</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/dream-casting-and-finding-character-with-your-own-voice-unlocking-the-vault-2" target="_self" data-discover="true">Dream-casting and finding character with your own voice - Unlocking the Vault #2</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"But when we think about a strategy RPG, there's a lot of different characters that you can control." He alluded to the wide types of enemies that introduce different kinds of antagonists who can fill out the story. Extrapolate out his thinking, and you can see how other gameplay needs like resource management, control of terrain, and recruiting or losing characters can integrate writing and gameplay.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Given that that's the overall format of the strategy RPG genre, it paints a good canvas to have more detailed storytelling," he said. Though Maehiro was specifically speaking about the strategy RPG genre, his thinking applies to other types of strategy games as well.</span></p><p>Image via Square Enix.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Tactics</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">' grand story isn't the only element tied to the core gameplay. Minagawa explained that in recreating the original's pixel art style—and in revamping it on in the game's "Enhanced" mode—he and his colleagues were bound by the very tiles players traverse. "When it comes to things like the character proportions, pixel sizes, even how far apart the eyes are on the face, all of those decisions are tied to the actual game design itself," he said. "If we were to try and change the character proportions to be able to depict the character in a different way, how that reads on the screen would differ."</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/nintendo-spells-out-why-player-communication-should-only-happen-in-game" target="_self" data-discover="true">Nintendo spells out why player communication should only happen in-game</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"The size of the maps, as well of the sizes of each of the panels and cubes would also be impacted by that."</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Deeper forces drive ">Deeper forces drive <span>Final Fantasy Tactics</span>' design</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">If you're mulling how the design principles of a game can shape its storytelling and art—you should also consider how hardware and tooling can shape design.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Minagawa explained that one infamous design limitation of the PlayStation—the lack of an in-console "Z-buffer"—came back to haunt him as the art director on </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The Ivalice Chronicles</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. Square Enix had created its own Z-Buffer on the original PlayStation version of the game, and all of the original art assets had been tied around that system. The art director, having come to the project off of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Final Fantasy XVI</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, admitted he was caught off guard by the scope of the remaster, thinking it would be simpler than a massive role-playing game filled with unique 3D assets. "I kind of assumed that if I were to take the basic information and try to re-output it to be much cleaner than that just should be a very simple and straightforward process," he admitted. "But doing so, I realized that actually leads to so many different technical external issues that I didn't expect."</span></p><p>Image via Square Enix.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Another limitation for updating the game came in the need to refine character animations for how they appear on larger screens. The PlayStation's highest resolution was 640p. Today the </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>minimum</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> resolution might be 720p. But the tooling used to make the original animations was only available within the PlayStation hardware environment. "It kind of operates natively in that environment as well," said Maehiro. "In retrospect, it did kind of make me think about how we probably shouldn't have kind of build things out within that really unique, specific environment."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Another regret Maehrio expressed: overwriting the original </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Final Fantasy Tactics</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> source code after moving to release the international versions of the game. Square Enix has updated its software preservation practices since then, but it's the main reason the team spent so much time poring over the mobile and PSP versions of the game, as well as studying player-archived data.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It's easy to look at those limitations and marvel at how Square Enix told such an ambitious story—and updated it for a modern era—with such specific constraints. But as always, it's the constraints that shaped the story above them.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This fascinating archival exercise seems to have paid off for </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Final Fantasy Tactics</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">—would the team ever tackle that effort for </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Final Fantasy Tactics Advance</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, the Game Boy Advance-exclusive sequel with an equally ambitious (if underrated) narrative? "The strategy RPG genre is a little bit more niche," Maehrio said with some care. "That said, I think if </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The Ivalice Chronicles</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> does really well...it also shows the business viability of the genre."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"That could potentially open doors for things like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Final Fantasy Advanced</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> getting the same treatment, or sequels or new titles," he said.</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Senior Editor, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Bryant Francis is a writer, journalist, and narrative designer based in Boston, MA.

<h2>Key Fixes &amp; Improvements</h2>
<h3><strong>Boss Fights &amp; Challenges</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Fixed an issue where striking the boss at the edge of the arena on level 4-5 could push it out of the <strong>camera’s view</strong>.</li>
<li>Several challenge conditions (like “Kill boss with a Ragebound Art” in 3-2 or “Win the duel” in 1-1) now properly trigger and <strong>reward your performance</strong>.</li>
<li>Adjusted Rhyvashi’s encounters: <strong>improved stagger cooldown</strong> and prevented attacks from lingering after defeat.</li>
<li>Corrected issues where <strong>skipping certain boss cutscenes</strong> (e.g., 4-5 helicopter pad) could result in Kenji being unfairly hit.<br></li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Gameplay Flow &amp; Checkpoints</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Fixed multiple <strong>soft-locks and freeze scenarios</strong> when pausing or restarting from a checkpoint.</li>
<li>Checkpoints now consistently heal Kenji across all levels, and properly <strong>respect equipped talismans</strong>.</li>
<li>Restarting from the last checkpoint during boss fights no longer leaves the <strong>health bar stuck on screen</strong>.<br></li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>Level-Specific Fixes</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li>Various <strong>collision issues</strong> were resolved (Kenji or Kumori getting stuck, clipping through bulldozers, cranes, or going out of bounds in 3-5, 2-2, S-5 and others).</li>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Tom Stone, former managing director at TT Games, the studio behind every major LEGO game (including the upcoming <a href="https://wccftech.com/lego-batman-legacy-of-the-dark-knight-tt-games-gamescom-onl-2025/">LEGO Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight</a>), has left his most recent position as chair of FuturLab (the <a href="https://wccftech.com/futurlab-releases-final-powerwash-simulator-content-update-as-all-focus-shifts-to-powerwash-simulator-2/">Powerwash Simulator studio</a>) to open Second Star Games. Stone and his new studio is going back to what he did with TT Games for nearly two decades; not making LEGO games, of course, but making games based on licensed IP, starting with Neverland and the adventures of Peter Pan.</p>



<p>This all comes from a new interview with Stone on <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/former-tt-games-head-takes-on-peter-pan">GamesIndustry.Biz</a>, where he discusses his tenure at TT Games and the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/features/22891555/lego-star-wars-the-skywalker-saga-has-led-to-extensive-crunch-at-tt-games/">reports of crunch that went on at the studio for years</a>, all of which came to a head with <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/lego-star-wars-the-skywalker-saga/">LEGO Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga</a>, and the attitude with which Stone and his 17 other studio members at Second Star Games approach their work now.</p>



<p>"<em>I think we're going to take a breath and look up occasionally.</em> <em>When we were making the LEGO games, it was intense. It was blood, sweat and tears. I loved every single moment of it, but upon reflection, we could</em> <em>have made fewer games slightly better and sold probably the same number of units that we sold</em>."</p>



<p>"<em>It was a pretty tough 15, 16, 17 years we had at TT. We were on a mission. We were focused. We achieved</em> <em>incredible things. Everything in life is a trade; people worked incredibly hard and the games were phenomenally successful. I don't think everyone complained that it was a tough culture. As happens, there were a number of people who justifiably and rightly said it was a tough environment; their voices were louder than the people who were saying they enjoyed working there and loved making LEGO games. Their voices weren't heard so much</em>." </p>



<p>Stone doesn't comment too much on what the studio will be working on, but does confirm what the studio's name already gives away, that they'll begin by making games based on Neverland and Peter Pan, but that's not all Stone wants his new team to do. Eventually, he wants the studio to have the same breadth of licensed titles that TT Games has.</p>



<p>"<em>The first is Neverland and the adventures of Peter Pan. Once we announced the studio, we actually had quite a lot of inbound interest, asking whether we'd be interested in working on this IP or that piece of IP. Obviously, we will be selective and thoughtful. We have to be mindful that we can't do it all at the same time, but the goal is to build out a stable of expertise in this young gamer space</em>."</p>



<p>"<em>Peter Pan is the fire that everyone is watching</em>, <em>while they all gather around the television together. The vision is to build a stable,</em> <em>bring the thoroughbreds in, and have everyone playing together around a screen.</em>"</p>



<p>It'll be interesting to see what Stone and his new team bring to the table with Neverland and Peter Pan-based games, and whether they'll sway closer to the kind of puzzle-platforming adventures that he used to make at TT Games, or if they'll be something entirely new. A few key members of Second Star Games are former TT Games staff who Stone says are all like-minded and on the same page about how they work together.</p>



<p>"<em>We're currently a team of 18 full-time employees. Everyone's the same. We're all in this boat together. Everyone knows each other. We don't want an HR department. Everyone is there to support one another in building this game together</em>. <em>It's going to be tough and challenging because we're setting ourselves incredibly high goals. We had a meeting last week in the studio, where we agreed on a particular design feature, which is going to be very, very challenging to achieve."</em></p>



<p>"<em>If we are not going to do stuff like that, what's the point of doing it? If we aren't going to break through and make this game truly memorable, then why bother? Everyone is on board. Everyone knows we are going to set ourselves some really, really high bar challenges, and everyone wants to do it</em>."</p>

            <p>"That's not a minotaur, that's just a guy with horns," yells one of the YouTube commenters on the reveal trailer of Minos. They might be right with their Monty Python-esque accusation, but regardless of how much the maze-building <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-roguelike-games-pc">roguelike</a> and its developers Artificer have put the cat amongst the Greek mythology-loving pigeons, the demo that's currently out for it is good fun.</p>

<p>Announced over the weekend by the devs of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/sumerian-six-is-shadow-tactics-but-youre-hitting-nazis-in-the-back-of-the-skull-with-a-hammer">Sumerian Six</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/homicidal-all-stars-is-now-called-showgunners-releasing-in-may">Showgunners</a>, the premise of Minos is simple, but effective. You play as famed labyrinth architect Daedalus and his pet, the horny guy/minotaur Asterion. Hordes of plucky adventurers with various combat styles wish to slay Asterion, and the only things standing in the way of their waves are squares of maze which you can use your prep time to rearrange and line with sneaky traps.</p>
<p>'Oh, so it's like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dungeon-keeper">Dungeon Keeper</a>?' said Edwin upon listening to that explanation in this morning's meeting of the RPS hivemind. Yes, probably, I answered, going slightly red at the mention of yet another <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/have-you-played-dungeon-keeper">classic game</a> I've yet to get around to playing for myself. Regardless of my dungeon keeping credentials, I enjoyed my dip into the demo for the currently release dateless Minos.</p><p>You start off by selecting a chamber in the labyrinth, which you'll have to defend against three or four waves of would-be-slayers with different fighting styles. The first wave enters the maze from one direction, and must be given a route to Asterion's lair within. Naturally, you'll want to rearrange walls and break through dirt blockages to send them the long way, having stuffed the route you're channeling them down full of as many lethal traps and twists as possible. Asterion can fight, but the game's very clear that it wants you to do the lion's share of your killing with traps, leaving the relatively vulnerable beast simply to clean up any stragglers.</p>
<p>The traps are suitably Tom and Jerry in nature, a collection of implements that wouldn't look out of place in Wile E Coyote's bottomless bag of ACME tricks. There's a satisfying ping to each backbiter floor panel that can only wipe out the last shuffler in a group. Flame traps crackle and trigger screams from the sizzling soldiers who wander on along their path, gradually burning to death. Balliste snipe sorry souls on sight. Lures are mounted in dead ends rather than on the designated mounting spots other traps have to be placed on, and will cleave through warriors who're attracted into straying from the beaten path. There are spikes, saws, Medusa heads and all manner of other day-ruiners waiting in the wings that I haven't had a chance to try yet.</p>
<p>As you progress in a run, typical roguelikery occurs. Mazes get more complex to modify, new variants of adventurer with different strengths and weaknesses join the hunt, and you delve ever deeper into the labyrinth. If Asterion falls, you'll be rocketed back to square one minus some resources, but having progressed towards upgrades that switch things up by unlocking the likes of new traps and upgrades to the minotaur.</p>
<p>I've yet to really get into the upgrading woods, but it all works well thus far. Minos does seem a fair bit drier and lacking in unique character compared to felllow Greek mythology-tinged roguelike Hades, but that's not necessarily an issue, more just an observation that stuck out to me having <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hades-2-10-review">recently played a bunch</a> of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hades-2">Hades 2</a>.</p>
<p>I'd say the demo's certainly worth giving a try, and you can find both it and the wishlist button on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3181650/Minos/">Minos' Steam page</a>, if you're so inclined. Say hello to the guy with horns on my behalf.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/resident-evil-requiem-9-2-4-horror-scary-grace-2000630216</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/resident-evil-9-will-swing-the-pendulum-away-from-re4%E2%80%99s-action-back-toward-horror.1312354/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>As one of the longest-running survival horror series, <i>Resident Evil</i> has had somewhat of an identity struggle over its many years. Some entries have been more action-focused, while others prioritized the dread and horror many come to the genre for. The last entry, <i>Resident Evil Village</i>, arguably leaned toward the action side of the equation. But the upcoming ninth entry, <i>Requiem</i>, aims to double down on the series’ horror elements.</p> <p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/resident-evil-requiem-devs-say-they-cant-tell-if-the-games-actually-scary-anymore">Speaking with <i>IGN</i></a>, <i>Resident Evil: Requiem</i>’s director Koshi Nakanishi describes the series as existing on a sort of <i>Resident Evil 2</i> and <i>Resident Evil 4</i> continuum, with <i>2</i> demonstrating the series at the height of its terror as a horror franchise, and <i>4</i> representing its desire to indulge in giving you more action-based solutions to confronting cities full of the undead. “Firmly swinging the scale [for <i>Requiem</i>] toward the <i>Resident Evil 2</i> style was our intention,” Nakanishi said. “It’s almost an upgrade of that <i>Resident Evil 2</i> style.”</p>

 <h2><i>RE </i>devs on what makes a game scary: ‘we don’t even know anymore’</h2> <p>A return to horror is good news for those of us who love <i>RE</i> for the frights first and foremost, and the ability for the protagonists to aim a gun competently second. The only problem is that the devs have made so many of these games that they’re starting to lose a sense of what’s actually scary. “We can’t tell anymore,” Nakanisi said of the fright factor in <i>RE</i> games.</p> <blockquote><p>There was actually a bit of worry internally before we showed the [<i>Requiem</i>] hands-off at SGF and the first hands-on at Gamescom, was this actually scary? Because we don’t even know anymore. This is our bread and butter, what we make every day.</p></blockquote> <p>In efforts to make <i>Requiem</i> scarier, the team debated whether or not it was worth mutilating the game’s protagonist, Grace, like previous characters in the series: “What if [she] gets a big gash in her leg, or her leg gets cut off?” Nakanishi said. While we don’t exactly know what bodily harm awaits our girl, based on early footage of the game, it looks like Capcom has dialed in an appropriate amount of horror. I mean <a href="https://youtu.be/4ikhM0aVofA?t=414">look at this friggin’ thing</a>.</p> <p><a href="https://youtu.be/4ikhM0aVofA?t=414">https://youtu.be/4ikhM0aVofA?t=414</a></p>

<p>In a <a href="https://avalanchestudios.com/stories/studio-update">statement shared by the company</a> today, the decision to restructure has been made "in light of current challenges to our business and the industry".</p>
<p>It continued: "This review had led us to the difficult conclusion that we must make changes to our staffing and locations. As a result, we are proposing to close our Liverpool studio, and to initiate a collective consultation process, as required by UK law. This will impact all Avalanchers in Liverpool. The changes will also impact our other studio locations in Malmő and Stockholm, where we will reduce our workforce and restructure the teams to address our games' needs."</p>
<p>It concluded: "Despite these changes, we remain deeply committed to providing amazing games to our passionate player communities." The statement does not mention Contraband and its cancellation specifically.</p>
<p>Contraband, a co-op smuggling game, was revealed in June 2021 at the Xbox and Bethesda Games Showcase, but little of the game has been shown since. Its official trailer has been removed from the Avalanche website, though you can see IGN's video above.</p>
<p>Its cancellation arrived in the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-begins-substantial-layoff-process-across-gaming-division-king-and-zenimax-impacted">wake of layoffs across Microsoft</a> in July, which <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-xbox-layoffs-june-2025-tracking-the-situation-as-it-happens">resulted in the cancellation of multiple projects</a> including The Initiative's Perfect Dark, Rare's Everwild, and an unannounced ZeniMax MMO.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-is-thriving-claims-ceo-doubling-down-on-ai-after-9000-employees-lost-jobs-in-latest-layoffs">Microsoft CEO and chairman Satya Nadella later claimed "Microsoft is thriving"</a>, largely due to its investments in AI.</p>
<p>Back in 2024, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/over-100-avalanche-studios-developers-are-unionising">Avalanche Studios entered a collective bargaining agreement with Swedish unions</a>, which was planned to go into effect by the second quarter of this year.</p>
<p>"Over the past years, we've taken significant steps toward making Avalanche one of the best workplaces in the games industry," Avalanche CEO Stefanía Halldórsdóttir said at the time.</p>

			<p>It’s the big Four-Oh for Mario, and while that would signal a bit of a midlife crisis in many men, he’s already taken up all manner of sports, been an avid kart racer for decades, and even spends many a weekend playing board games. What else to do, then, but reminisce about that time he went to space in Super Mario Galaxy and Super Mario Galaxy 2?</p>
<p><iframe title="Super Mario Galaxy + Galaxy 2 Review –&nbsp;A Happy 40th Remaster" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nsqJgE7y2fc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>This pair of games are rightly held up as two of the very best platformers of all time. Those opening hours of Mario Galaxy are still an absolute delight as you bounce between small celestial bodies, run any and all directions around oddly shaped planetoids and structures, head into a strange space pill for some gravity-shifting 2D platforming, and then still find that there’s more traditional feeling Mario levels as well. Well, about as traditional as you can be when you turn into Bee Mario and have to clamber around on a queen bee. Super Mario Galaxy 2 showed just how fertile this platforming concept was, adding Yoshi into the gameplay mix, using his tongue to grab things with the pointer, new power ups, and more.</p>


<p>Remastering these two beloved platformers is no small feat. One of the problems with Nintendo’s more experimental phase starting with the Wii and DS is how difficult it can be to translate their Wiimote pointer and touchscreen to more typical controllers. Mario Galaxy was built with the screen pointer in mind, to gobble up star chunks, fire them at enemies and interactive objects, grab onto items on screen and to trigger spin moves with a quick waggle (with a button press backup). It becomes even more integral in Galaxy 2 as you often rely on Yoshi to gobble things up and grab things with his tongue.</p>


<p>None of that’s a problem for the Switch or Switch 2, with motion sensors built into all the official controllers, and playing on a TV with Joy-Con in hand, moving with the left stick and pointing with your right hand, does a great job of capturing that original Wii feel – just tie the wrist straps together for a truly authentic Wiimote and nunchuck experience. The one thing missing is that you can’t use your right hand as a mouse pointer, which is reserved only for a player 2. I guess this might have required a few too many button remapping gymnastics. Playing with a Switch Pro Controller also works great, though it feels a bit more clumsy to be tilting both hands together to move that cursor.</p>
<p>The real pain point for the 35th anniversary 3D All-Stars rendition of Mario Galaxy came with the handheld experience. Here, instead of letting you tilt the console to move a pointer, you were forced to lift a hand and touch the screen to interact. That’s still an option with these 40th anniversary remasters, but now you can use motion as well.</p>

<p>The handheld experience is just one sign of a remaster that digs deeper and goes much further to make these two games feel as native as possible. It extends to many more areas as well, so while the menus still look and feel like Nintendo Wii menus with gigantic buttons you can point at or touch, the cursor can also snap to buttons when using an analogue stick. New and revised game options are built into the game’s menus instead of a Switch Online-like emulator overlay, you’re no longer prompted to save after every level completion, and there’s a whole new Assist mode that modifies the game with more health for Mario, health recovery when standing still, and easy recoveries from falls into oblivion.</p>
<p>And then there’s the graphical improvements. On Switch 2, you now have 1080p when playing handheld and a 4K output to TV. Nintendo’s aversion to anti-aliasing remains, but when the resolutions match your screens, it feels better, and it’s paired with revamped textures that generally feel like someone’s wiped the Vaseline off your glasses – other petroleum jellies are also available to smear on your glasses. Grass textures go from mottled colours to having more distinct shaped patches, or there’s now a checkerboard pattern overlaid on the sky of the Honeyhive Galaxy.</p>

<p>Is it perfect? Not quite. There are some texture swaps that shift in what feels like a less detailed direction, and there’s also places that aren’t improved, like Captain Toad’s very low poly count model, and I’d argue that the Switch 2 in particular should be able to handle a longer draw distance and remove some more shadow pop in.</p>
<p>I also feel like the pre-rendered cutscenes could have had a bigger improvement. They’ve been re-rendered and have an opened up aspect ratio, but they still come off as being relatively low resolution from the massive amounts of depth of field in place. Still, this is a generally handsome set of remaster works that (judging by the initial reaction to the announcement thinking that it was a simple upscaling) does a great job of capturing what you remember these games as having looked like 15+ years ago.</p>

<p>There’s not too much more to this bundle beyond that – a new storybook in Galaxy 2, for example – and that’s part of why the £34/$40 per game and £59/$70 combined pricing might feel steep. In truth, it’s in keeping with the Metroid Prime remaster, per game, and if you’re still into physical games, you can get a good few quid off that way.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section>
<p><em>Reviewer's note: Although this is a Switch 1 release, we were only permitted to play the game on Switch 2 during the review period. On launch day, we'll update the text below with specific Switch 1 performance impressions.</em></p>
<hr>
<p>I have to admit, prior to this review, it’s been a while since I played either <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/super_mario_galaxy">Super Mario Galaxy</a> or <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/super_mario_galaxy_2">Galaxy 2</a>. I dabbled a bit in the first entry in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_3d_all-stars">Super Mario 3D All-Stars</a>, but I spent the majority of my time there playing <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/super_mario_sunshine">Mario Sunshine</a> (still my ‘favourite’ of the 3D entries – blame nostalgia, I guess) before getting sidetracked by other games.</p>
<figure><a title="Super Mario Galaxy + Super Mario Galaxy 2 Review - Screenshot 1 of 8" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/159162/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>So in the time since I last properly ventured into the great beyond with my favourite plumber, I’ve experienced a plethora of genuinely incredible 3D platformers like <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/astro_bot">Astro Bot</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/crash_bandicoot_4_its_about_time">Crash Bandicoot 4</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a>, and of course, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_odyssey">Super Mario Odyssey</a>. Jumping back into Galaxy and Galaxy 2 on Switch 2, two things became apparent: first, a few minor technical hiccups with the games are perhaps more noticeable now than they were 15 years ago; and second, they <em>still</em> represent 3D Mario at its absolute peak.</p>
<p>These games are Nintendo’s crowning achievement. They’re bursting with creativity to a degree I’ve not seen elsewhere before or since. Whether you’re skating across a frozen lake against a backdrop of stars and a beautiful piano melody, or ground-pounding a bloomin’ <em>meteor</em> into a giant floating Bowser accompanied by the most bombastic orchestral track imaginable, this pair provides experiences that will stick with you forever. They’re simply that impactful.</p>
<p>They've never looked as beautiful as they do here, either. Not only do you get to enjoy them at up to 4K in docked mode and 1080p in handheld, but many textures have been updated to take advantage of those crisper resolutions. There’s nothing here that’s comparable to the upgrades seen in, say, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/metroid_prime_remastered">Metroid Prime Remastered</a>, and it’s possible you might not immediately register the changes, but many environmental assets in particular look much more detailed.</p>
<figure><a title="Super Mario Galaxy + Super Mario Galaxy 2 Review - Screenshot 2 of 8" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/159163/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>The UI is also cleaner, with an altered font and slightly smaller icons. The version of Galaxy 1 included in 3D All-Stars did the bare minimum, but Nintendo has finally given both games the love that they deserve, and they look glorious.</p>
<p>In addition to the enhanced visuals, these releases also feature several gameplay additions. ‘Co-Star Mode’ makes a welcome return for those who wish to bring a friend on board to help gather Star Bits or defeat enemies. Player Two waggles their Joy-Con about to move the onscreen cursor, but if you’re on Switch 2, you can also use the console’s mouse functionality, and it works wonderfully. Chances are you’ll play both games solo, but it’s a nice little extra regardless.</p>
<p>Taking inspiration from Odyssey, both games also feature ‘Assist Mode’ to help out newcomers or really anyone who needs a bit of a leg up. This automatically doubles available health, and you can even nullify damage by standing still to regain it. Finally, if you happen to fall off a ledge, a bubble will encircle Mario and bring him safely back to land. Galaxy 2 in particular can be pretty tricky, so it may prove useful.</p>
<figure><a title="Super Mario Galaxy + Super Mario Galaxy 2 Review - Screenshot 3 of 8" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/159164/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>For those interested in Galaxy’s in-game storybook, the first entry has a brand-new chapter. In addition, a completely fresh storybook has been added to Galaxy 2, with its own new accompanying music. I won’t go into detail, but they’re fun, albeit inconsequential additions that I enjoyed reading.</p>
<p>And finally, amiibo are supported, though you’d be hard-pressed to find a scenario in which they actually prove useful. I don’t have many, granted, but every amiibo I tapped into the game yielded about three Star Bits. Pretty useless, then. There are, however, two <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/mario-galaxy-amiibo-are-on-the-way-plus-two-new-kirby-ones-with-swappable-bases">Mario Galaxy amiibo</a> coming on 2nd April 2026 (yeah, only 182 days after the games launch!) - the Mario &amp; Luma amiibo provides a health boost, while Rosalina grants a 1-Up mushroom.</p>
<p>As for the general controls, if you’ve played 3D All-Stars, then you’ll know roughly what to expect. Naturally, you can't use a Wii Sensor Bar on Switch, so gyro is used for collecting Star Bits and executing the Spin Attack (though you can also just tap ‘Y’ for this). It’s undoubtedly the most sensible solution, but it’s still not ideal; you’ll find yourself frequently tapping ‘R’ to recentre the pointer, and if you’re using a Pro Controller, twisting and turning it constantly feels somewhat awkward. Using the Joy-Con separately is the best way to play in docked mode.</p>
<figure><a title="Super Mario Galaxy + Super Mario Galaxy 2 Review - Screenshot 4 of 8" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/159165/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>In handheld mode, you can use the touchscreen, but gyro control (for the pointer) is also available, which was missing from 3D All-Stars. Waggling the console around to collect Star Bits can sometimes feel a bit weird, and again, you’ll be resetting the cursor with ‘R’ constantly. The sensitivity feels about right, though, so relatively small movements yield big results. Regardless, let’s just say you probably won’t find me playing these games on public transport.</p>
<p>Otherwise, Mario feels just as natural to control as ever. You could argue that Nintendo pushed the movement fluidity even further with Odyssey, but whether you’re hopping around on a series of tiny planets or swinging from flowers atop Yoshi’s back, it never feels any less than exhilarating. Mario Sunshine rightly garnered some criticism for its twitchy, unpredictable movement, but the Galaxy games struck the perfect balance, taking everything that worked so well in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/super_mario_64">Mario 64</a> and polishing it to a mirror sheen.</p>
<p>As for the games themselves, if you’ve somehow never played either before, then it’s worth knowing roughly what each entails. The first — you'll be <em>shocked</em> to hear — sees the dastardly Bowser kidnap Peach (along with her entire castle) before blasting Mario off into the far reaches of space. Our hero meets Rosalina and the Lumas, and must travel to a host of galaxies to collect enough stars to reach Peach and defeat Bowser. It’s standard stuff, but Rosalina's introduction is significant, with the character making multiple appearances in subsequent games and becoming a fan favourite. It's also worth adding here that if you also own Galaxy via 3D All-Stars, you can't transfer your save over to this new version.</p>
<figure><a title="Super Mario Galaxy + Super Mario Galaxy 2 Review - Screenshot 5 of 8" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/159152/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>In Galaxy 2, the setup remains roughly the same, with newcomer Lubba taking over Rosalina’s role as leader of the Lumas. Here, you travel between galaxies via Starship Mario, a delightful little fortress fashioned after the plumber’s head. Neither game provides a particularly captivating story (though the storybooks do a good job at fleshing things out), but this really doesn’t matter one iota – the gameplay more than makes up for any narrative shortcomings.</p>
<p>Indeed, the real draw of both games is the galaxies themselves, with standouts including SpaceJunk Galaxy (oh man, the music!), Throwback Galaxy (a Mario 64 recreation, are you kidding me?!), and Toy Time Galaxy (giant Mecha Bowser – need I say more?) . I also adore Bowser's levels, which include an awesome rendition of his classic theme from Mario 64 before ending with spectacular boss encounters that feel genuinely epic.</p>
<p>Sending Mario into space sounds ridiculous on paper, but it really was a stroke of genius. The way the games subvert expectations around how a 3D platformer should function is marvellous. Gravity plays tricks at every turn, and there are countless moments where you think you might fall into the abyss only to flip upside down and land on the underbelly of a teeny, tiny planet. It’s utterly absurd, but it just <em>works</em>.</p>
<figure><a title="Super Mario Galaxy + Super Mario Galaxy 2 Review - Screenshot 6 of 8" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/159153/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>The only caveat is that sudden changes in camera angles can occasionally mess with your directional inputs; you need to release the left stick entirely and let things recentre before continuing.</p>
<p>The absurdity is really what makes these games so special. They go places and do things that aren’t possible elsewhere, even in the mighty Mario Odyssey. Most games are tied to the limitations of their worlds, but going into space gave Nintendo licence to break the rules and create scenarios that stretch the absolute limits of creativity. There’s nothing else quite like it. One moment you'll be buzzing around and climbing a wall of honey with the Bee Mario power-up in Honeyhive Galaxy, and the next you'll be flipping up and down as the gravity shifts in time with the funky music in Upside Dizzy Galaxy.</p>
<figure><a title="Super Mario Galaxy + Super Mario Galaxy 2 Review - Screenshot 7 of 8" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/159154/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>I mentioned one power-up there, but both games include several awesome transformations that completely turn the gameplay on its head, and they're all wonderful. If you want, you can also swap over to Luigi in both games after meeting certain criteria; a lovely little bonus for fans of Green 'Stache.</p>
<p>Which brings me to the price. You’re looking at $39.99 / £33.99 for each game separately, or $69.99 / £58.99 for the bundle. That’s a lot of money, no question about it. I can understand why folks have gotten up in arms about it, but it's hard to deny <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/04/nintendo-comments-on-mario-kart-worlds-controversial-price">the quality of the "content" and "value"</a> here; Galaxy and Galaxy 2 are two of the greatest platformers of all time that, if you’re playing on Switch 2, run at native 4K while docked. Even if you’re on Switch 1, you’re still going to benefit from a whole bunch of upgraded textures that make the games look better than ever.</p>
<figure><a title="Super Mario Galaxy + Super Mario Galaxy 2 Review - Screenshot 8 of 8" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/159155/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Should they be cheaper simply because they’re ‘old’? I don’t know. It’s a tough scenario, and ultimately, I wouldn’t begrudge anyone for skipping these releases if you already own them on the Wii. What I can say with absolute certainty, however, is that if you do pick them up on Switch, you’ll be treating yourself to 40 hours+ of borderline perfect video gaming.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>There’s no question about it: Super Mario Galaxy and Galaxy 2 are two of the most sublime games ever created. With gameplay that subverts expectations and scenarios that wouldn’t be possible if not for the creative freedom of the cosmos, they represent the Mario series at its absolute best. They look better than ever, boast small yet welcome additions, and expand upon the narrative with new storybook pages.</p>
<p>Gyro aiming simply isn’t as effective as the Wii pointer, however, and you’ll be recentring the onscreen cursor a lot. Very minor issues with the camera are also a bit more noticeable now than they were 15 years ago, but the fact that Nintendo managed to pull off some utterly ridiculous sequences without the camera going haywire remains a remarkable feat. These games command a high price on Switch, to be sure, but you’ll be playing them for the rest of your life.</p></section>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Today, NVIDIA has released a new GeForce Game Ready driver (version 581.42) optimized for EA's Battlefield 6 game. The driver lands a week and a half before the launch of Battlefield 6, scheduled for October 10. Just as in the recent beta, the game will support NVIDIA DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation, Frame Generation, Super Resolution, DLAA, and Reflex. Unlike Battlefield V and Battlefield 2042, <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-ditched-ray-tracing-focus-performance/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">there won't be any ray traced effects as the developers focused entirely on performance</a>. On that note, they also recently <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-series-s-limitations-battlefield-6-better-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">credited their work on optimizing the game for the Xbox Series S</a> as key to improving performance even on other platforms, PC included.</p>



<p>The new GeForce Game Ready driver is also optimized for FBC: Firebreak's Breakpoint Update, <a href="https://wccftech.com/fbc-firebreak-first-big-update-september-29/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">which was released yesterday on all platforms</a>. FBC: Firebreak already included support for path tracing, NVIDIA DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation, Frame Generation, Super Resolution, Ray Reconstruction, and Reflex.</p>



<p>Earlier this month, the space simulation sandbox game X4: Foundations received NVIDIA DLSS 4 Multi Frame Generation and Frame Generation support alongside the game's 8.00 Diplomacy update. The game previously supported DLSS Super Resolution (which has now been upgraded to the transformer model) and DLAA.</p>



<p>Today, <a href="https://wccftech.com/alien-rogue-incursion-part-one-evolved-edition-announced-no-vr-headset-needed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Alien: Rogue Incursion Evolved Edition from Survios</a> launches on PC (and consoles) with day-one support for NVIDIA DLSS 4 with Multi Frame Generation, DLSS Frame Generation, DLSS Super Resolution, and Reflex.</p>



<p>NVIDIA also unveiled that Project G-Assist, <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-project-g-assist-makes-ai-useful-to-gamers-assists-in-game-tuning-performance-diagnostics-pc-customization/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the experimental AI assistant</a> that helps users tune, control, and optimize their PCs with voice or text commands, is rolling out new updates and adding new commands for laptop users, including optimizing game and app settings for on-the-go play, controlling BatteryBoost to improve battery life while maintaining a smooth frame rate, and enabling WhisperMode to reduce fan acoustics by up to 50% by adjusting game and app settings and frame pacing.</p>



<p>Lastly, the GeForce company alerted would-be buyers to the week's latest deals for its GeForce RTX 50 Series graphics cards:</p>

			<p>Super Mario is officially leaping into middle-age, as this year marks the 40th anniversary of the 8-bit classic that started it all. Nintendo doesn’t have much in the way of original content to celebrate Super Mario Bros. turning the big four-oh, but they are rolling out newly-remastered versions of <a href="https://wccftech.com/super-mario-galaxy-2-launch-on-nintendo-switch-systems-next-month/">Super Mario Galaxy and Super Mario Galaxy 2 for Switch</a>, with an additional free upgrade available for Switch 2 owners. In the case of Super Mario Galaxy 2, this is actually the first time the red-headed stepchild of the Super Mario series has been re-released since it’s initial debut on the Wii in 2010.</p>



<p>Are Super Mario Galaxy 1 and 2 still out-of-this-world experiences? Or should you keep your expectations down to earth? Blast off for my impressions...</p>



<p><em>Note: This is an opinion piece and, thus, not as detailed as a full scored review would be.</em></p>



<figure></figure>



<p>To this day, there aren’t many, if any, other platformers quite like the Mario Galaxy games. The action in both titles mostly unfolds across a series of floating spheres and irregular objects, with Mario gravitationally drawn to these mini planets and asteroids. This allows Nintendo to create stages that offer full 3D freedom of movement, including some mind-bending gravity-defying stuff, while simultaneously eliminating the need for complex camera controls as the planetoids Mario explores are limited in size and move as he does.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>The end result is a very fun and approachable form of 3D platforming, which, in turn, allows Nintendo to push the bar in terms of action and spectacle without overwhelming people. Mario Galaxy 2 largely sticks to the same formula, while upping the difficult a smidge and introducing Yoshi, an addition I’ve always been a bit mixed on, as I don't love the pointer-based controls for his tongue (I think Galaxy 1 is the better game overall, but your mileage may vary).</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>No question about it, Super Mario Galaxy 1 and 2 are still a blast to play, although Nintendo has pushed the weirdness bar so hard with <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/super-mario-odyssey/">Super Mario Odyssey</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/super-mario-bros-wonder/">Super Mario Bros. Wonder</a>, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/donkey-kong-bananza/">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> that the Galaxy games almost feel a little reserved today, which isn’t necessarily a bad thing. If you're looking for traditional platforming with a little extra flash, the Mario Galaxy games deliver even if they do feel a bit dated in some respects in 2025.</p>



<p>The Mario Galaxy games were originally designed around a Wiimote and Nunchuck control scheme, and while a pair of Joy-Cons stand in okay, gyro aiming just doesn’t feel as good or reliable as the old IR pointer. I admit, I also miss the sheer amount of secrets and extra stuff packed into Nintendo’s newer 3D platformers – the Galaxy games can feel a bit one-note and barren in comparison at times.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Only minimal changes have been made to Super Mario Galaxy 1 and 2’s gameplay, with a new Assist Mode being the only real addition -- a somewhat odd choice of focus given the Galaxy games aren't known for their overwhelming difficulty. Nintendo has also expanded the Rosalina storybook content from the original game, which is cute, but obviously not something that's going to change your experience in a major way.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>It was borderline miraculous what Nintendo was able to achieve visually with the Mario Galaxy games on the Wii, and the games held up well aesthetically for years afterwards, but they are starting to show their age now. These new versions of Super Mario Galaxy 1 and 2 are actual remasters, rather than the emulated ROMs running at a higher resolution we got in the<a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/super-mario-3d-all-stars/"> Super Mario 3D All-Stars</a> collection, although Nintendo has taken a pretty light touch here. Some textures, assets, and the UI have been updated, and on Switch 2 you can play at an uprezed 4K, but I played both the 3D All-Stars and new versions of Super Mario Galaxy back-to-back to test, and the latter was only a marginally better experience. Also, I &nbsp;swear the pointer controls actually feel better in the 3D All-Stars version of the game.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Nintendo is being more flexible than usual when it comes to these new versions of Super Mario Galaxy 1 and 2, offering both a two-game physical/digital bundle for $70 and the ability to buy each individually digitally for $40, giving those happy enough with the 3D All-Stars version of Mario Galaxy an option to just buy Mario Galaxy 2. Of course, some will question Nintendo's pricing given these are older games, but it's hard to be too terribly upset when you're getting 30 to 60 hours of high-quality platforming for your 70 coin investment. &nbsp;</p>

<h2 id="h-still-a-satisfying-star-trek"><strong>Still a Satisfying Star Trek</strong></h2>



<p>Super Mario Galaxy and Super Mario Galaxy 2 are still great games that offer a stripped-down, streamlined, blockbuster brand of action that still stands out as unique next to Nintendo’s more recent exploratory collection-heavy 3D platformers. These new remasters do the games justice, but not a whole lot more than that, with little in the way of new content and a very light-touch visual makeover. Whether these games are for you, and in what configuration you want to buy them, will largely come down to your own personal play history with the series, but Super Mario Galaxy's skies haven't lost their sparkle.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Super Mario Galaxy + Super Mario Galaxy 2 can be bought as a 2-pack for $70, or individually for $40 each, on October 2 for Nintendo Switch. Owners of the Switch versions can download Switch 2 upgrades for free.</p>
