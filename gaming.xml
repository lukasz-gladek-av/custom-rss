            <p>Futuristic racer Fast Fusion will receive an update later this week, adding new tracks and a new rendering mode without upscaling.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-fast-fusion-most-technically-impressive-switch-2-launch-title">Digital Foundry reported</a>, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-nintendo-switch-2-the-digital-foundry-hardware-review">Switch 2</a> launch game actually renders at a low image resolution but uses the console's DLSS equivalent to upscale the image. Put simply, the game has been criticised for poor image quality, despite being such a fast game.</p>
<p>Now, developer Shin'en Games is introducing a new render mode called "Pure" that removes upscaling and instead renders at a native 1440p when docked (and 1080p in handheld).</p>

<p>What's more, a new Carbium Cup will be added, including three new tracks: Alpine Trust, Sunahara Plains, Zenshoh Habitat.</p>
<p>Players of previous game Fast RMX may recognise these tracks, though they have all-new graphics and changed layouts to make use of Fast Fusion's Hyperjump feature.</p>
<p>Further additions include: a new particle effect for snow, two new jukebox entries, a lower price to unlock the third cup for easier progression, fixed an issue where the game shut down when changing render mode, while stability and performance improvements have been implemented.</p>
<p>The update will arrive on 26th June.</p>

<p>Fast Fusion is one of the few brand-new launch games for Nintendo's new console. It's the follow up to Switch game Fast RMX, itself an improved version of Fast Racing Neo on Wii U.</p>
<p>Anyone who's a fan of the F-Zero or WipEout series will find much to enjoy here, with the game's high speed thrills, rollercoaster tracks, and techno soundtrack. Indeed, it's a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/f-zero-gx-on-switch-2-is-virtually-unplayable-without-remapping-the-controls">modern day rival to F-Zero GX</a> - one of three GameCube games available on Switch 2 through Nintendo Switch Online.</p>
<p>"The Switch 2's best launch exclusive might not be <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a>, but another racing game," wrote <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-best-launch-exclusive-mario-kart-world-fast-fusion">Eurogamer's Tom Orry on Fast Fusion</a>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-launch-game-fast-fusion-gets-update-to-improve-image-quality]]></content:encoded>

		<p>Rebellion and Liberty Films have released a set of four stills, giving a first look at the upoming <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/rogue-trooper">Rogue Trooper</a> movie adaptation from Duncan Jones.</p>
<div id="attachment_461224"><p id="caption-attachment-461224">image credit: Rebellion, Liberty Films</p>

</div>
<p>Written and directed by Jones ‚Äì best known for Moon, Source Code, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2016/05/26/is-warcraft-the-videogame-movie-weve-all-been-waiting-for/">Warcraft</a> and Mute ‚Äì Rogue Trooper adapts the cult 2000AD comic book for the big screen, a story that was previously adapted to video games in the mid-noughties (and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2017/10/17/rogue-trooper-redux-review/">remastered in 2017</a>). The film stars Aneurin Barnard (The Goldfinch, Dunkirk) as the Rogue Trooper, and Jemaine Clement (Avatar 2: The Way of Water) and Matt Berry (What We Do in the Shadows) as battleground looters Mr Brass and Mr Bland.</p>
<div id="attachment_461225"><p id="caption-attachment-461225">image credit: Rebellion, Liberty Films</p></div>
<p>They‚Äôve all donned full motion capture suits for the movie, which is fully CGI, similar to Jones‚Äô Warcraft movie, or the predominantly CG Avatar films. Filming was completed last year using head mounted cameras for performance capture, while imagery and animation partner Treehouse Digital has been feeding all of that into Unreal Engine 5, before Liberty Films then add their own VFX and animation on top.</p>

<div id="attachment_461222"><p id="caption-attachment-461222">image credit: Rebellion, Liberty Films</p></div>
<p>The other still shots give a look at a huge war vehicle on Nu Earth, which is the location of the battle between the Norts and Southers, and we get to see some Souther soldiers who are lost in the toxic wasteland of battle.</p>
<div id="attachment_461221"><p id="caption-attachment-461221">image credit: Rebellion, Liberty Films</p></div>
<p>Producer Stuart Fenegan said, ‚ÄúWe are so excited to share a first look of the film and show the amazing fidelity with which the team have used our actors on set performances to drive the animated characters. That level of detail and nuance was a priority from day one.‚Äù</p>
<p>Duncan Jones, meanwhile, had this to say: ‚ÄúAHHHHHHHHHHHH! WE‚ÄôRE ALMOST FINISHED! SEE YOU AT SDCC!!‚Äù</p>
<p>He‚Äôs going to be at San Diego Comic Con on 25th July for a fan meeting and signing of the Rogue Trooper hero image.</p>

			<p>Neverness to Everness, the open-world gacha RPG in development by Hotta Studio, looks to deliver the anime GTA fantasy that no one knew they wanted, judging from some recent footage.</p>
<p>The new footage was shared as part of a new Containment Test Preview livestream that provided a new look at some of the game's features and mechanics, such as the urban open-world, characters, traversal, and more. As if the urban setting wasn't enough to label the game as a sort of anime GTA, the developer shared during the livestream footage of one of the main playable characters stealing a car and becoming wanted by the police. While the disconnect between the character design and committing crimes is enormous, it's undeniable that there's something charming in seeing an anime GTA experience. Hopefully, the game will be as fun to play as it looks in this early footage.</p>

<p>Neverness to Everness was <a href="https://wccftech.com/neverness-to-everness-is-a-new-gacha-open-world-rpg-from-tower-of-fantasy-devs-powered-by-ue5-with-nvidia-dlss-rtx/">announced</a> almost one year ago by Hotta Studio, a Perfect World subsidiary that released Tower of Fantasy, another gacha RPG, a couple of years back, which failed to make a significant splash in the genre dominated by HoYoverse's games like Genshin Impact. Powered by Unreal Engine 5, the game will feature cel-shaded graphics like most games featuring Japanese anime aesthetics and will support advanced PC features like NVIDIA DLSS and ray tracing.

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xbox-layoffs-next-week-report</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/xbox-reportedly-planning-big-layoffs-next-week.1226964/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A new report has emerged which alleges that Xbox is planning what sound like sweeping layoffs across the company, shortly before the end of Microsoft's fiscal year.</p>

<p>According to Bloomberg's <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-06-24/microsoft-plans-major-job-cuts-at-xbox-gaming-division" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Jason Schreier</a>&nbsp;(who, in turn, cites "people familiar with the plans who asked not to be identified discussing nonpublic information"), the planned layoffs at Xbox are part of a "company-wide reorganization".</p>

<p>Schreier's report doesn't estimate how many employees will lose their jobs at Xbox, but he does say the cuts will be "substantial" and that they'll be made "across the entire [Xbox] group", so it sounds like every department has a chance to be affected by the layoffs.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/gears-of-war-reloaded-xbox-layoffs-report.jpg?itok=mLR1YWmq 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/gears-of-war-reloaded-xbox-layoffs-report.jpg?itok=IvoQbyAP 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Xbox is planning layoffs across its entire division, according to a new report.</figcaption></figure><p>As Schreier points out, this will be the fourth time Microsoft has engaged in layoffs across an eighteen-month period. Most recently, the company <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/microsoft-3-percent-layoffs-report" rel="nofollow">let go around 3% of its total employees</a>, with a Microsoft spokesperson then claiming the layoffs were to help the company achieve "success in a dynamic marketplace".</p>

<p>Prior to that, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/microsoft-layoffs-january-2025" rel="nofollow">another wave of layoffs</a> took place at Microsoft in January. In both cases, Microsoft didn't disclose exactly how many employees lost their jobs, although they did do their employees the courtesy of revealing this information for layoffs <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/microsoft-gaming-layoffs-september" rel="nofollow">put into effect in September last year</a>.</p>

<p>That's all in addition to almost 2,000 layoffs from the Xbox gaming workforce in <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/microsoft-xbox-layoffs-report" rel="nofollow">January last year</a>. Of course, none of this stopped CEO Satya Nadella <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/microsoft-ceo-payrise-layoffs" rel="nofollow">scoring an eye-watering payrise</a> in October, but then again, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ea-ceo-25-million-income-layoffs" rel="nofollow">t'was ever thus</a>.</p>

<p>Microsoft hasn't officially confirmed this latest round of Xbox layoffs yet, and it didn't provide comment to Bloomberg either, so we don't officially know these cuts are going ahead. It's entirely possible Microsoft may never publicly announce the cuts, too.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/grounded-2-xbox-layoffs-report.jpg?itok=z6CRKBSP 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/grounded-2-xbox-layoffs-report.jpg?itok=X34ivtta 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Xbox is currently gearing up to release games like Obsidian's&nbsp;<em>Grounded 2</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>These cuts come as part of a wider industry layoff wave that has seen companies both <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bioware-layoffs-veilguard-failure" rel="nofollow">big</a> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/playtonic-layoffs-yooka-laylee" rel="nofollow">small</a> affected, as well as plenty of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ea-cancels-black-panther-game-and-closes-studio-making-it" rel="nofollow">project cancellations</a> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monolith-productions-and-more-reportedly-closed-by-wb-games" rel="nofollow">studio closures</a> to boot.</p>

<p>We'll have to wait and see if Microsoft issues an official statement confirming Bloomberg's reported layoffs. Stay tuned for more on this one.</p>

            <p>If ever there was a game I didn't expect to spawn a horde of spiritual successors from startup companies of varying dubiety, that game was celebrated commie hangover simulator <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/disco-elysium">Disco Elysium</a>. And yet here we are with yet another claimant to the dance floor, Pera Coda. In fairness, it takes inspiration from a lot more than just ZA/UM's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a>, but Disco Elysium is mentioned rather prominently in the marketing.</p>
<p>Created by Falan, a Turkish team founded by three architecture students, Pera Coda is a timeloop story set in a "surreal", "neon-noir" Istanbul, in which you play an attorney, Deniz, who is navigating a purgatory inspired by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bardo">Bardo in Buddhism</a>. The city is described as "both a stage and a mirror, where East meets West, chaos meets calm, and each district reflects a piece of your fragmented self." Certainly sounds quite Revacholian. Here's a teaser trailer.</p><!--more-->

<p>Combat there is none: instead, you'll solve point-and-click puzzles and make use of a "masking" mechanic, which lets you resculpt Deniz's memories and alter certain objects in ways that persist across loops. The investor pitchdeck I've been sent compares the puzzling to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/outer-wilds">Outer Wilds</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/12-minutes">12 Minutes</a>. Another comparison that springs to my mind is <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-sexy-brutale">The Sexy Brutale</a>. </p>
<p>The Falan devs have posted a few concept videos of the game on social media, ahead of today's announcements. It's seemingly thanks to the popularity of those early videos that they've now partnered up with Elyzio, a company founded in 2022 by former Ubisoft technical director Anas El Ferachi and Google gaming consultant Dogan Can Yeginer. You might know Elyzio as the publishers of <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1689640/Wardens_Will/">Warden's Will</a>, a movement shooter that earned a few thumbs-up from the Steam reviewerati. </p>
<p>Pera Coda's current development team under Elyzio includes game designer Cem √áelik, previously a junior designer at Crytek, technical director Arthur Trouslard, who has worked across Ubisoft, Sloclap and Don't Nod, and Mehmet Ali ≈ûen, formerly of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/cultic">Cultic</a>, whose past credits include <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1360390/Cats_and_the_Other_Lives/">Cats And The Other Lives</a>.</p>
<p>Very much speaking as a clueless Anglo European tourist, the thing I find most interesting about Pera Coda is the city, which is "grounded in real iconic buildings and neighbourhoods", but is punctured by hallucinations. I would also like to hear more of the game's interpretation of Bardo, about which I am also clueless. Here are some screens.</p>

<p>If you prefer your Disco Elysulikes to be developed by people who worked (in whatever capacity) on Disco Elysium, may I refer you to the three direct heirs - <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-psychogeography-est-of-disco-elysiums-spiritual-successors-is-a-gonzo-journalism-rpg-named-hopetown">Hopetown</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/yet-another-studio-formed-of-disco-elysium-alumni-has-announced-a-cerebral-sci-fi-rpg-just-to-confuse-you">XXX Nightshift</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/former-disco-elysium-devs-are-working-on-a-spiritual-successor-at-new-studio-longdue-though-robert-kurvitz-and-aleksander-rostov-arent-involved">whatever they're making at Summer Eternal</a>. All three were announced within hours of each other, producing what Nic called "an "I'm Spartacus"-ass day of press releases".</p>
<p>The rush continues with games like <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2057760/Esoteric_Ebb/">Esoteric Ebb</a>. There are also a bunch of smaller Disco Elysuals on <a href="https://itch.io/c/5746476/disco-elysium">Itch.io</a>. I realise I'm probably doing some or all of these projects a disservice by framing them as Disco Elysium follow-ups, but it does feel a bit mad. Rumour has it that the pigeon currently trapped in your office is also making a Disco Elysium successor in collaboration with Tencent, based on the five minutes it once spent shitting on a ZA/UM staffer's sandwich. Personally, I'm reserving my pennies for the dawning of a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/roadwarden">Roadwarden</a>-like trend.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/disco-elysium-has-yet-another-heir-in-pera-coda-a-turkish-timeloop-rpg-set-in-a-dreamlike-version-of-istanbul]]></content:encoded>

The Xbox portfolio now constitutes the biggest gaming content publisher in the world, but at the cost of greater scrutiny and revenue expectations.

That‚Äôs kind of a foundation for us. And what that does is it allows us to continue to invest in Xbox for our community of players and creators and that we‚Äôre doing it. It does mean we have to make trade offs through the year on things that we‚Äôre going to invest more in, things that we‚Äôre not going to invest as much in because it is kind of we are the business that we are.‚Äù</p><p>The result has been not only bringing major first-party games like <em>Sea of Thieves</em> and <em>Gears of War</em> to PS5, but also raising prices. <em>The Outer Worlds 2</em> will be the company‚Äôs first $80 game this fall, and the price of the Xbox Series X/S recently spiked due to new tariffs amid Trump‚Äôs ongoing trade war with China. It feels like only a matter of time before Game Pass Ultimate, currently $20 a month, also goes up in price again.</p><p>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/xbox-prices-layoffs-next-gen-hardware-ps5-1851784992]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><strong>Journey Into Dreams Shaped by Point Cloud Technology</strong></p><p><em>Dreams of Another</em> is a third-person exploration action game built around the philosophical theme: No Creation Without Destruction. Unlike traditional <a title="Genres > Third-Person Shooter [1,316 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/shooter/tps">third-person shooter games</a> where shooting destroys objects, here, shooting materializes and creates from an otherwise abstract, fragmented world.</p><p>The game‚Äôs standout feature is its use of point cloud rendering, where space is visualized as a collection of floating particles. On PlayStation VR2, this technique truly shines, enveloping the player in a dreamlike world where your body feels as though it‚Äôs dissolving into the environment. The result is a mysterious and deeply immersive sensation, like traveling within a dream itself. Thanks to VR, players can feel that they physically exist within these worlds made up of nothing but particles.</p><p><strong>A <a title="Games > Myst (2020) [1 article]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/myst-2020">Myst</a>erious Story of the Man in Pajamas and The Wandering Soldier</strong></p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>At the heart of <em>Dreams of Another</em> is a surreal journey through a dream world, led by two characters, The Man in Pajamas and The Wandering Soldier. But this world isn‚Äôt just inhabited by people: trees swaying in the wind, lonely doors, softly glowing streetlights, and all sorts of objects come alive with humorous dialogue that casts a quirky light on the questions of human society. Through <a title="Genres > Virtual Reality [191 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/virtual-reality">virtual reality</a>, they feel as though they‚Äôre right there in front of you, drawing you even more deeply in.</p><p><strong>Seamlessly Switch Between First and Third-Person Perspectives</strong></p><p>In the PlayStation VR2 version, players can switch between the third-person perspective used in the <a title="Platforms > PS5 [9,795 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps5">PlayStation 5</a> version and a special virtual reality-only first-person mode. The third-person view emphasizes the game‚Äôs concept and storytelling, allowing players to watch the narrative unfold while seeing their character. In contrast, the first-person mode offers heightened immersion, placing the world of point clouds directly in front of your eyes and allowing for close-up inspection of every detail.</p><p>We recommend using the DualSense controller for third-person mode and the PlayStation VR2 Sense controllers for first-person mode. Either way, you‚Äôll experience the shimmering, particle-built dream as if you were truly inside it.</p><p><strong>Eye-Tracking Camera Control in Third-Person View</strong></p><p>Third-person mode takes advantage of eye-tracking, allowing players to shoot simply by looking in a direction. This keeps the intuitive feel of the standard PlayStation 5 version while making gameplay even faster and more fluid. Both the regular and VR versions use haptic feedback and adaptive triggers for a uniquely Dreams of Another experience to further deepen the immersion.</p><p><strong>A Variety of Weapons and Quirky Items</strong></p><p>As players traverse the dreamlike landscape built of point clouds, they‚Äôll encounter entities called Auras. These require a variety of weapons such as submachine guns , grenades and rocket launchers to overcome and these are unlocked as you play through. The rocket launcher, in particular, offers a thrilling experience as its immense power scatters wide areas of point clouds, instantly materializing the impact zone.</p><p>Grenades, on the other hand, offer a tense and strategic gameplay experience as players must carefully time their explosions to hit the Auras. VR amplifies the tension and impact of Aura encounters in a different way again, making them feel even more direct and thrilling. You‚Äôll also discover curious items likeSomeone‚Äôs wedding ring or A blown fuse that has served its purpose, adding another layer of exploration and wonder to the game.</p></div><p><em>Dreams of Another</em> is due out for PlayStation 5 with PlayStation VR2 support and PC via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3561230/Dreams_of_Another/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam</a> in 2025.</p><p>Watch the trailer below.</p></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2025/06/dreams-of-another-playstation-vr2-gameplay-trailer]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Popular gaming peripheral manufacturer Dbrand has acknowledged a defect affecting a small number of its Project Killswitch <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2?page=2">Nintendo Switch 2</a> cases.</p>
<p>This defect impacts the lip attaching the joycons to the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-nintendo-switch-2-the-digital-foundry-hardware-review">Switch 2</a> screen, disconnecting when the console is held up by a singular joycon. Speaking to influencer Nintendo Prime, the company has stated it's in the process of fixing the issue.</p>
<p>"Yep, we're definitely working on it. Ultimately, this is a manufacturing tolerance issue on the small lip keeping the Joy-Con Grips attached to the Joy-Cons (some were a hair too thick)," Dbrand told Nintendo Prime. "We've got a replacement program set up already, where anyone who is affected is able to email robots@dbrand.com with 'July Joy-Cons' in the subject to be added to the list for replacement stock in July."</p>

<p>According to Nintendo Prime, Dbrand also acknowledged this problem was replicable among a "small number of units from their run". Nintendo Prime didn't share the exact number he was told, but reemphasised any defective Killswitch cases could be replaced for free in July.</p>
<p>There are plenty of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-accessories-deals-third-party-jsaux">great third-party accessories for the Nintendo Switch 2</a> - Dbrand's Killswitch included!

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/project-motor-racing-will-speed-onto-xbox-series-x-s-ps5-and-pc-in-fall-2025/">Project Motor Racing</a> developer Straight4 Studios and publisher GIANTS Software have announced that the upcoming sim racing game will arrive on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S on <strong>November 25, 2025.</strong></p>
<p>A new trailer showcases Project Motor Racing's career mode and the intricacies involved in how Straight4 Studios is simulating the career of a professional racer, where winning isn't always the most important thing. It's being able to afford the next race, win or lose.</p>
<p>"<em>We wanted to capture the harsh reality of pro motorsport</em>," said the game design director at Straight4 Studios, Austin Ogonoski, in a press release.</p>
<p>"<em>Budgets, repairs, sponsors. Failed overtakes that don't just wreck your car but your whole season. Your career in Project Motor Racing is motorsport with consequences</em>."</p>
<p>The career mode will have you negotiating sponsorships, what you can afford to build out your car, and the choice between giving it your all in each race versus making sure you'll have a car to race with for the next one.</p>
<p><iframe title="Single Player Reveal: Your Career Starts November 25, 2025" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/i-TcJHeA_3s?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Along with the release date and the introduction of the career mode, publisher GIANTS Software also confirms that the game will launch with full modding support on day one.</p>
<p>The game is being built with the GIANTS Engine, and as the company's head of publisher, Boris Stefan put it in a press release, "<em>Project Motor Racing taps into the same powerhouse modding ecosystem as Farming Simulator. Racing modders will be able to tweak, tune, and transform their experience however they like.</em>"</p>
<p>Pre-orders are now available for Project Motor Racing on all platforms.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/i-skipped-every-death-stranding-cutscene-and-i%E2%80%99ll-do-it-again.1226898/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>I beat the original <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/1/20941606/death-stranding-review-ps4-hideo-kojima">Death Stranding</a></em>, but please don‚Äôt ask me what happened in it. There was a cataclysm ‚Äî not quite a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/664492/clair-obscur-expedition-33-twist-spoilers">Gommage</a> ‚Äî that made the US more divided than ever, and you play as a babysitter-meets-delivery-guy who has special awareness of invisible, hostile creatures called BTs that are ‚Äúbeached,‚Äù which isn‚Äôt as relaxing as it sounds. There are grenades filled with pee, poop, and blood, and everyone who‚Äôs anyone was motion-captured to be in the game. There are whales, Guillermo del Toro (in appearance but not in voice), huge pools of tar, and Geoff Keighley is there, too.</p><p>Sounds like a silly game, right? It is, especially if you skip all of the cutscenes in the game, like I did. And I plan on doing the exact same thing now that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games-review/690468/death-stranding-2-review-ps5">the sequel is here</a>.</p><p><em>Death Stranding</em>‚Äôs long cutscenes repelled me from playing through it, and I say that as a longtime fan of the <em>Metal Gear Solid</em> games. After five or so failed attempts at getting past the first episode since the game‚Äôs 2019 launch on the PS4, due to trying to play it ‚Äúright‚Äù ‚Äî which I thought required close examination of every word and frame of this bizarrely written story ‚Äî I just said ‚Äúscrew it.‚Äù I finally beat the game on my Steam Deck (runs great!) just a couple months ago.</p><p>It‚Äôs not that the cutscenes are bad, but their plodding, cinematic pacing feels at odds with the game‚Äôs overarching design, which is a glorified physics sandbox stuffed with just as much humor as there is desolation. Plus, the gameplay is so good that I didn‚Äôt want to wait for my reward of just getting to run around again and deliver stuff. Anything that helps me more quickly get to the ridiculous mid-to-late-game Sam-versus-Higgs boxing match is worth it.</p><p><em>Death Stranding</em>, even when played as an exposition-light adventure, still holds up because the game is good at doling out meaningful upgrades to how you traverse the fractured land. Aside from missions that require speed (such as pizza delivery) or the utmost care (such as nuke delivery), its design embraces open-ended exploration.</p><p>Similar to <em>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</em>, some early environmental obstacles might prove overwhelming enough to put you on a staid, critical path from time to time, but it rarely forces you to choose one method over another. Put a ladder here, a rope or bridge there, or drift down a mountain on a floating carrier. It‚Äôs fun enough just getting to tough-to-reach markings strewn about the world where fellow Porters have‚Ä¶ peed. Experimentation breathes levity into a game world that really needs more of it.</p><div><p><cite>GIF: Cameron Faulkner / The Verge</cite></p></div><p>Skipping cutscenes allowed me to fully sink my teeth into a game that I would have otherwise missed out on. And you‚Äôd better believe that I‚Äôll be playing <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games-review/690468/death-stranding-2-review-ps5"><em>Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</em> </a>the same way. Despite the allure of some seriously quirky characters and the potential of this being the last game in the series for a while (perhaps <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/31/24057536/physint-is-the-working-title-of-hideo-kojimas-new-not-a-metal-gear-game">Physint</a></em> will be next from Kojima Productions), I‚Äôm holding fast to my playstyle. I‚Äôm most interested to see how the sequel evolves traversal, and the interplay of the environment and player choice. Cutscenes are just another obstacle.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games/690231/death-stranding-cutscenes-skip]]></content:encoded>

A promise that the company will begin slapping the Xbox logo on anything that is capable of streaming Game Pass. Smart TVs are now Xboxes. PC gaming handhelds are, too. Why not bundle a limited-edition Xbox controller with a Meta Quest 3S and call it an Xbox too?</p><p>The entry-level Meta Quest 3S 128GB is currently $300. The Xbox version will be $400 but comes with a limited-edition Xbox controller in addition to the standard Touch Plus controllers and three months of Game Pass Ultimate. This is, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/06/24/meta-quest-3s-xbox-edition/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/06/24/meta-quest-3s-xbox-edition/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">in Microsoft‚Äôs words</a></span>, ‚Äúeverything you need to start gaming on a massive virtual display the moment you open the box.‚Äù</p><p>That‚Äôs primarily because the Meta Quest 3S can stream a selection of Game Pass games that support cloud gaming like <em>The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered</em>. The pitch from Microsoft is: ‚Äústart a game on your Meta Quest 3S Xbox Edition, pick up where you left off on your console, and continue the adventure with Xbox on PC without ever losing your achievements or saved data.‚Äù That‚Äôs a cool idea in theory, but the caveat is that it‚Äôs  limited to streaming and games that already support Play Anywhere.</p><p>This is the same Achilles‚Äô heel that impacts the upcoming <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/xbox-rog-ally-pc-gaming-handheld-price-date-switch-2-1851784000&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-rog-ally-pc-gaming-handheld-price-date-switch-2-1851784000">Xbox Ally ROG PC gaming handheld</a></span>. It‚Äôs a custom Windows experience designed to feel like playing on an Xbox, but it can‚Äôt play existing Xbox-only releases. Lots of big games like <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>, <em>Elden Ring</em>, and <em>Assassin‚Äôs Creed Shadows </em>don‚Äôt support Play Anywhere, meaning you still need to purchase the game twice. I‚Äôd love it if that weren‚Äôt the case, but for now it is. Until those gaps are filled in, it‚Äôs hard to see more Xbox-branded devices as anything other than niche collectors‚Äô items for enthusiasts. </p><p>Meta has never released sales numbers for the Quest 3, but estimates a year ago were that it had sold at least 1 million units. Microsoft probably isn‚Äôt lying when it stresses how ‚Äúlimited‚Äù the Xbox Edition Quest 3S is, but it raises the question of why the partnership exists if it‚Äôs going to stop short of making the headset double as an official accessory for existing Xbox consoles that can stream native games remotely as a second display. </p><p>Maybe because VR is an even tougher sell than PC gaming handhelds. PlayStation VR 2 is <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://mixed-news.com/en/psvr-2-sales-figures-estimation-toast-interactive/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://mixed-news.com/en/psvr-2-sales-figures-estimation-toast-interactive/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">rumored</a></span> to have sold only about half as many units as Steam Deck. That might be why Meta is ending <em>Beat Saber</em> support for the Sony peripheral. Coincidentally, the reduced price of Sony‚Äôs headset makes it cost the same as the Xbox Quest 3S. </p><p>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/meta-quest-3s-xbox-vr-game-pass-price-handheld-1851784984]]></content:encoded>

It sees Bella Ramsey, who plays Ellie in HBO‚Äôs The Last of Us adaptation, and Josie Sedgwick-Davies return to voice Molly and Frizzle from Dawn of the Nugget. But it‚Äôs also got Chicken Shop Date creator Amelia Dimoldenberg, too.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/06/24/gettyimages-2203000182-1750769939753.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Amelia Dimoldenberg not on a date in a chicken shop. Photo by Cindy Ord/VF25/Getty Images for Vanity Fair.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">You can see why Dimoldenberg is involved, given the nature of her YouTube interview show. Dimoldenberg has seen a meteoric rise to fame in recent years as ever more famous celebrities agree to a spot of fried chicken on a first date. The question is, will Spider-Man star Andrew Garfield join her on the cast?</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Back to the game! Here‚Äôs the official blurb:</p><blockquote>Chicken Run: Eggstraction follows the film Chicken Run: Dawn of the Nugget, with an exciting new story that continues the adventures of its feathered heroes as they work to save chickens from the evil nugget industry, where chicken-kind is still in danger! Take control of the Chicken Run characters, and embark on a mission to infiltrate five fortified farms and liberate the captive chickens. But beware, there are plenty of eggstra security measures in place that players will need to overcome to lead these fowl to freedom. From avoiding watchful security cameras and hawkeyed humans to hiding in traffic cones, players will be tested on their stealth, skills and strategy. Equipped for up to two players in local co-op, players can tackle this high-octane adventure alone, or team up with a friend to hatch a plan for success.</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Image credit: </em><a href="https://youtu.be/eFS5vxYlfY8?feature=shared" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Amelia Dimoldenberg / YouTube</em></a><em>.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">On the surface, Grave Seasons might look like any other nice, cozy farming sim like Stardew Valley or Harvest Moon: you‚Äôre a stranger who‚Äôs come into a farm in the small town of Ashenridge, full of seemingly friendly people. You plant and harvest crops, craft items, and make friends. But there‚Äôs a mysterious, unnerving sense that tugged at the back of my neck during my half-hour playing Blumhouse Games and Perfect Garbage‚Äôs not-so-cozy farming sim. One that kept me much more engaged than your garden-variety farming game, with its impressively intriguing threads that added a little drop of poison to the well.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">After a brief intro to the player character, who‚Äôs escaped a prison sentence in search of a new beginning, things start getting weird. Hari, a neighborly caretaker who‚Äôs maintained the property since falling into ruin, greeted me with an incredulous (but charming) hello, which doubles as a quick tutorial. At first glance, the stuff he introduced me to wasn‚Äôt that strange. I had the standard tool wheel, complete with a shovel, pickaxe, watering can, and so on. But I also had a crowbar?</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">That‚Äôs because Grave Seasons isn‚Äôt just a grim or slightly spooky take on farming: it‚Äôs also a mystery game. And while I didn‚Äôt have a chance to use a crowbar during the early section I played, it sounds like you‚Äôll need to use it to break open locked doors later on in the story. But given the mysterious circumstances under which my character came into their new home, I‚Äôm curious to learn about their motives and means.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Grave Seasons isn‚Äôt just a grim or slightly spooky take on farming: it‚Äôs also a mystery game.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">After working my new land, picking some chilis, cabbage, and tomatoes that Hari so neatly planted ‚Äì and doing a little planting of my own, burying some carrot seeds my new friend offered as a welcoming gift ‚Äì I did some exploring. To my shock, I found a severed hand and a bloodied ring amidst the weeds and garbage littering the far reaches of the property. I tugged at this new thread immediately, taking it to Hari to see what he had to say about it, rendering shock and horror from my musclebound, tutorial-dispensing neighbor.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Nothing really came from this interaction, beyond that reaction, and the revelation that I could talk to Hari about other stuff, and even offer them a gift. Obviously, I‚Äôm sure there are opportunities to spend more time with them (or any character, as I met later) and figure out what he might actually want. But a half-hour demo isn‚Äôt exactly designed for that kind of long-game mindset. So I gave them the chocolate ice cream cone in my inventory as a sign of friendship (and maybe more). Unfortunately, he reacted to the frozen treat about as well as he did to the hand‚Ä¶ I didn‚Äôt get another chance to try my hand (no pun intended) at offering them something else, but given Grave Seasons‚Äô dark, slightly comedic tone, I‚Äôm curious to see what winds up tickling their fancy in the full game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Then I retreated to my shed, where I found a pickling and fermenting station a while earlier to put my chilis and cabbage to good use by making some kimchi. This highlighted one of my favorite parts of Grave Seasons. Although it‚Äôs decidedly horror-focused, Grave Seasons doesn‚Äôt skimp on the stuff that makes farming games great in the first place. With a diverse menu, well-realized in a sharp, pixelated art style, this demo made me hungry as I marveled at the pixel art of garlic, hummus, pickles, and salads. Kimchi in hand, I set back out to my house to find a new character sitting on the edge of the well in my yard.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/06/23/04-1750722909801.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Pilar, a fashion designer with a passion for vintage clothing, greeted me with another warm welcome before telling me about their plans to forage for some rare herbs that night. After agreeing to explore my new home a bit, I tried talking to them more, again about the hand, getting another shocked response. I gave them my fresh kimchi to see what they thought about it, but just like Hari, no dice.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Pilar and Hari's dialogue was consistently engaging, funny, and distinct in a way that conveyed loads of personality and life.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Here was another favorite part of the demo: just talking to Pilar and Hari. Their dialogue was consistently engaging, funny, and distinct in a way that conveyed loads of personality and life. I would‚Äôve sat there for the entire demo just gifting them every last radish, head of lettuce, and cigarette in my inventory if I could. Based on the trailer and other materials Perfect Garbage has shared, I‚Äôm excited to see what other characters I get to meet. And I‚Äôm eager to watch them play out their roles in this mystery, which deepened at night.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/06/23/03-1750722932949.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">After cleaning up some trash, mining for some minerals and iron, watering my carrots, and putting some crops into storage to be sold, it was time to take a walk in the woods with Pilar. Upon walking into the gulley, something was immediately off. Then, a pair of bright red eyes opened behind them, claws emerging at Pilar‚Äôs ankles, illuminated by their lantern. In the blink of an eye, some kind of eldritch beast mangled Pilar. It took me about a minute to refix my dropped jaw after seeing that‚Ä¶ I can‚Äôt believe how expressively gory Grave Seasons would get, or that they just killed off Pilar like that.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That was the end of the demo, but it absolutely left me wanting more. Setting up a story that blends in all sorts of seemingly disparate threads like this ‚Äì from small-town murders to bloodthirsty creatures beyond comprehension lurking in dark woods ‚Äì created just the right kind of intrigue. I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôll wind up investigating my now-dead friend‚Äôs witchy ways, make more friends (and enemies), and grow crops to make tasty food while doing it.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/06/23/02-1750722948942.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">I‚Äôve had a lot of trouble sticking with most farming sims because they lacked a certain sense of intrigue; that hook to keep me looking forward to the next day for something other than fresh crops. This is exactly what the developers at Perfect Garbage are looking to remedy with Grave Seasons; I‚Äôm sure this first day was a condensed version of the kind of pacing we‚Äôll see in the full release, but I love the balance of visual novel-like mystery with the more relaxing pace of farming gameplay, ensuring that fresh crops grow in time with the narrative and dramatic tension.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Grave Seasons promises to inject something sinister into the farming sim genre with a compelling horror-mystery that seems on track to deliver personality, fright, and charm in spades. I‚Äôm interested to see and learn more about Grave Seasons‚Äô community of charming townsfolk and the secrets lurking underneath Ashenridge‚Äôs small-town veneer when it ships on PC and consoles sometime next year.</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/grave-seasons-is-a-cozy-farming-sim-with-a-dark-side]]></content:encoded>

Every second demands split-second strategy and decisions as you navigate explosive asteroids belts, electrically charged debris, and icy barriers that threaten to freeze your momentum.</p><p>But fear not, the universe does throw lifelines. Scattered throughout space are Energy Crystals to increase your mass, and Stardust to push your velocity to the limit. Do you hoard mass for durability or fuel for raw acceleration? The landscape shifts with every level, leaving you with only one choice ‚Äì adapt; here, balance is everything.</p><p>But you are not alone on this path. The most unpredictable hazards in Meteora are the other meteors on your path, each with its own elemental composition and unique abilities. Every meteor that crosses your path presents an opportunity or a threat. Some are rivals, some are fuel for your journey, but all are obstacles in your pursuit for survival.

As speed modes and power-ups shift, the triggers tighten and release, reflecting the intensity of acceleration and deceleration. The tactile experience extends to electrification and freezing effects, making these moments truly visceral.</p><p>One of our favorite sensations is tailgating enemy meteors. The faint yet distinct rumbles mimic the fiery heat of an opponent‚Äôs trail, adding a subtle but impactful layer of immersion that only the Sense controllers can achieve.</p><p>Beyond realism, we‚Äôve designed the controls to feel intuitive and effortless, ensuring players exert minimal effort for maximum fun. Since no one truly knows what piloting a meteor feels like, we‚Äôve abandoned traditional steering mechanics. Instead, we aimed for a fluid, organic movement system, making the experience as natural as possible because being a meteor should be instinctive, not complicated.</p><p>With haptics, adaptive triggers and 3D Audio integration, Meteora transforms space racing into an experience you can see, hear, and feel.</p><p><strong><a title="Genres > Virtual Reality [191 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/virtual-reality">Virtual Reality</a> or Flat Screen: The Choice is Yours</strong></p><p><em>Meteora</em> is designed to provide a seamless experience, whether played in virtual reality or non-virtual reality.

          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p>Video game development veteran Masahiro Sakurai, who is best known for creating the Kirby franchise and for his work on the Super Smash Bros. series, has said the current model of large-scale game development is "becoming unsustainable."</p><p>He told <a href="https://www.itmedia.co.jp/business/articles/2504/18/news061.html" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">ITMedia </a>as translated by <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/super-smash-bros-creator-masahiro-sakurai-on-his-working-style-the-changing-industry-and-unsustainable-aaa-development" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN</a>, "I think it is becoming unsustainable to continue producing large games on the scale that companies currently do, as it requires too much work."</p><p>Sakurai added that independent game developers are facing challenges, too. He said indie developers "need a lot of luck, effort, polish, and stand-out elements to succeed in the market."</p><p>The developer went on to say that he sees generative AI as a possible solution to help developers, especially teams that make large-scale games.</p><p>"The only effective breakthrough I can think of at the moment is generative AI. I think we are getting to the point where (AAA studios) have to change their way of working by using gen AI to improve work efficiency. I think we are in an era where only the companies that successfully respond to these changes will be able to survive," he said.</p><p>Sakurai mainly makes games for Nintendo, but his company, Sora Ltd., is not owned by the gaming giant. Nintendo of America president Doug Bowser has said he believes AI will play a role in the future of gaming, but the "<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-boss-talks-ai-amid-concerns-of-job-cuts-there-will-always-be-a-human-touch/1100-6530667/" data-ref-id="1100-6530667">"human touch" will always be necessary to make great games.</a></p><p>Bowser is basically echoing what Nintendo president Shuntaro Furukawa said back in 2023. At the time, the executive said Nintendo would consider leveraging AI like it would any new technology, but <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-sees-potential-in-generative-ai-but-wont-make-games-created-by-technology-alone/1100-6524707/" data-ref-id="1100-6524707">games will not be made by "technology alone."</a> Mario creator Shigeru Miyamoto, meanwhile, has said <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mario-creator-shigeru-miyamoto-talks-ai-says-nintendo-wants-to-go-in-a-different-direction/1100-6526727/" data-ref-id="1100-6526727">Nintendo won't necessarily rush to utilize AI</a> just because other companies may be doing so.</p><p>Sakurai is not the first person to question the sustainability of the AAA landscape, as former PlayStation boss Shawn Layden has been <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/former-playstation-boss-talks-about-the-collapse-of-creativity-in-aaa-game-development/1100-6527223/" data-ref-id="1100-6527223">beating that drum for years.</a> As for the role new AI systems can play in the future of game development, it remains to be seen how it will shake out, but developers are already using such tools to speed up development. EA Sports said this week that it created a <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/ea-sports-college-football/college-football-26/news/cfb26-campus-huddle-presentation?cid=84496&amp;ts=1750691127277" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">"newly upgraded machine- learning-based pipeline"</a> to speed up development on CFB 26. In 2024, the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/study-finds-majority-of-game-dev-companies-use-generative-ai-already-despite-worker-concerns/1100-6528919/" data-ref-id="1100-6528919">majority of video game developers worldwide were using AI tools to make games</a>, despite ongoing concerns from workers.</p><p>Kingdom Come director Daniel Vavra previously spoke positively about his hope that an <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/kingdom-come-2-director-hopeful-ai-revolution-can-help-him-make-games-faster/1100-6531008/" data-ref-id="1100-6531008">"AI revolution" will help his studio make games faster and more efficiently.</a> Not everyone is so enthusiastic about the role of AI in gaming going forward, as enigmatic game developer Yoko Taro recently said <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nier-director-yoko-taro-says-ai-will-make-all-game-creators-unemployed/1100-6531185/" data-ref-id="1100-6531185">"AI will make all game creators unemployed."</a> It remains to be seen how companies adopting AI systems might impact employment. Larian Studios' Swen Vincke has embraced AI to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-dev-embraces-machine-learning-for-tasks-that-nobody-wants-to-do/1100-6531123/" data-ref-id="1100-6531123">automate tedious tasks</a> no one wants to do.</p>

            <p>"Major job cuts" are set for Xbox as part of a company-wide reorganisation.</p>
<p>That's according to a <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-06-24/microsoft-plans-major-job-cuts-at-xbox-gaming-division">Bloomberg report</a>, which states these cuts will begin next week. While Bloomberg reporter Jason Schreier said it is currently unclear how many people will be affected by the alleged job cuts, "it's expected to be big".</p>
<p>According to the report, sources famaliar with the company's plans said managers within Xbox are expecting "substantial cuts across the entire group".  </p>
<p>This would not be the first time Microsoft and Xbox have made headlines for layoffs in the last 18 months. Back in January 2024, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-to-lay-off-1900-people-across-xbox-and-activision-blizzard">1900 people from across Microsoft's video game teams were laid off</a>. A further <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-lays-off-further-650-xbox-staff-no-games-cancelled-or-studios-closed">650 staff were then let go that September</a>.</p>
