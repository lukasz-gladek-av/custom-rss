<p>Ranked Battles Season 2 kicks off on <strong>6th November</strong> at 6am UTC and will reward all those that reach Rank K or higher with a Delphoxite Mega Stone — which, as you might expect, can be used to evolve Delphox into Mega Delphox. You can't get the stone anywhere else in the game, so it's well worth taking part if you have this fully evolved Gen 6 starter in your squad.</p><div><figure data-videoid="2LcP6TZzqhM" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2LcP6TZzqhM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/2LcP6TZzqhM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2LcP6TZzqhM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed635c59gwyxpk&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>837k</span></a></p>

<p>Here's the precise time that the event will get underway in your region:</p>
<ul><li><strong>North America:</strong> 10pm (Wed) PST / 11pm (Wed) MST / 12am CST / 1am EST</li><li><strong>UK/Ire:</strong> 6am GMT</li><li><strong>Europe:</strong> 7am CET / 8am EET</li><li><strong>Asia/Oceania:</strong> 3pm JST / 2pm AWST / 5pm AEDT</li></ul>

<p>All Pokémon numbered 001-229 in the Lumiose Pokédex (sorry Zygarde) will be able to take part in this one, though all levels will be set to Lv. 50 to keep things as fair as can be.</p>
<p>This means that there's just one week left to nab as many rewards as you can in Ranked Battles Season 1, including the Greninjite. You'll find everything you need to know about the current season, including how to play and the full list of rewards, in our complete guide below.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dont-nod-netflix-game</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dont-nod-working-on-new-narrative-game-based-on-major-netflix-ip.1338415/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><i>Life Is Strange&nbsp;</i>and&nbsp;<em>Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage&nbsp;</em>developer Don't Nod has announced that it's signed a development deal with Netflix to produce a new game based on one of the streaming giant's IPs.</p>

<p>The news was announced as part of Don't Nod's <a href="https://www.dontnod-bourse.com/en/financial-information/press-releases/?ID=ACTUS-0-94850" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">financial results</a> for the first half of the 2025-26 fiscal year, which show that revenue has increased by a factor of 3.8 when compared to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dont-nod-financials-first-half-2024" rel="nofollow">the same period last year</a>.</p>

<p>The studio puts its revenue growth down to the "solid progress of its operational transformation" and the signing of the aforementioned Netflix deal, although I'm not sure the employees who <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dont-nod-employees-strike" rel="nofollow">lost their jobs</a> as part of that "operational transformation" would be particularly happy with their part in things.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/lost-records-dont-nod-netflix.jpg?itok=OQ2UJ4If 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/lost-records-dont-nod-netflix.jpg?itok=ekFOSdWg 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage&nbsp;</em>studio Don't Nod is making a game with Netflix.</figcaption></figure><p>With regards to the Netflix deal, Don't Nod simply says it has signed an agreement with Netflix "for the creation of a new narrative video game based on a major IP", and that the studio intends to build on its "recognized expertise in the genre" for the project.</p>

<p>It's not clear what the IP in question is, but my money's on 80s throwback horror property&nbsp;<em>Stranger Things</em>. Back in 2018, it was announced that <i>The Walking Dead</i>'s Telltale <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/telltale-is-making-stranger-things-adventure-game-with-netflix" rel="nofollow">would work on a&nbsp;<em>Stranger Things&nbsp;</em>adventure game</a>, but the project was closed when the studio <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/updatedtelltale-games-begins-closing-entering-assignment-proceedings" rel="nofollow">closed its doors that same year</a>.</p>

<p>Don't Nod's experience with games like&nbsp;<em>Life Is Strange</em>,&nbsp;<em>Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage</em>, and&nbsp;<em>Tell Me Why&nbsp;</em>would arguably make them the ideal choice for reviving that project, although since nothing official has been announced yet, this is all just speculation.</p>

<p>The Netflix game will take its place alongside two other in-development projects at Don't Nod, namely narrative-led action-adventure title&nbsp;<em>Aphelion&nbsp;</em>and a mysterious game known only as "P14" at present.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dont-nod-aphelion-financials-2025.jpg?itok=LyhmDavE 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dont-nod-aphelion-financials-2025.jpg?itok=8Y8cGGBh 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Don't Nod is gearing up to release action-adventure game&nbsp;<em>Aphelion&nbsp;</em>next year.</figcaption></figure><p>In any case, things are perhaps looking slightly more optimistic for Don't Nod, although we'll have to wait and see how&nbsp;<em>Aphelion&nbsp;</em>and this tentative Netflix game shape up. Stay tuned for more.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/805174/halo-campaign-evolved-remake-xbox-ps5-release-date"><em>Halo </em>coming to PlayStation</a> is one of those events that, five years ago, would have been the tell that “something is not right here” in a show about time travel or alternate universes. Looking at the state of Xbox with its layoffs, game cancellations, price hikes, studio closures, and a soft release schedule light on attention-grabbing titles, it certainly seems like all is not well. But the company’s focus on tearing down the walls of its garden by multi-platforming its biggest exclusives combined with a push to make Xbox games playable on just about anything, denotes a strategy that may be what keeps the green guys in the game for a while longer.</p><div><p>Xbox has been offering exclusives to its competitor’s platforms since last year. The company tested the waters with smaller titles like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/21/24078043/grounded-pentiment-nintendo-switch-release-microsoft-xbox-exclusive-games"><em>Grounded</em> and <em>Pentiment</em> on the Switch</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/21/24079090/hi-fi-rush-ps5-xbox-release-date"><em>Hi-Fi Rush</em> and <em>Sea of Thieves</em></a> on the PS5 before graduating to bigger, buzzier hits like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/610817/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-ps5-release-date"><em>Indiana Jones and The Great Circle</em></a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/671575/senuas-saga-comes-to-ps5"><em>Senua’s Saga: Hellblade II</em></a>, and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/661169/gears-of-war-reloaded-remaster-release-date"><em>Gears of War</em></a>. <em>Halo</em>, the crown jewel of Xbox exclusives, is merely the apotheosis of this multi-platform strategy.</p></div><p>In May, Sony reported that <em>Indiana Jone</em>s, <em>The Elder Scrolls V: Oblivion Remastered</em>, and <em>Forza Horizon 5 </em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/661814/xbox-best-selling-games-ps5-oblivion-minecraft">were among the top downloaded games on the PS5</a>. And while they’re not exclusives, other Xbox published games including <em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</em> and <em>Minecraft</em> were also on the list. “The biggest games in the world are available everywhere,” said Xbox president Sarah Bond <a href="https://mashable.com/article/xbox-president-sarah-bond-calls-console-exclusives-antiquated-mashable">in an interview with <em>Mashable</em></a>. “The idea of locking [games] to one store or one device is antiquated for most people.” Xbox games have enjoyed more success simply by being available to more people. That openness is supported by the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/14/24296420/microsoft-this-is-an-xbox-marketing-campaign-xbox-everywhere">“This is an Xbox” marketing campaign,</a> which aims to bring Xbox content beyond the console itself.</p><p>Xbox console sales have always lagged behind PlayStation and Nintendo and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/10/26/23425029/microsoft-xbox-game-pass-profitable-revenues">Xbox Game Pass subscriptions are slowing down</a>. The Trump administration’s tariff policy has forced <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/717610/nintendo-switch-original-price-increase">all</a> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/762410/sony-ps5-price-hike-raise-digital-pro">three</a> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/782079/microsoft-xbox-console-price-increase-us">console makers</a> to raise their prices in contravention of the tradition of consoles getting cheaper as they age. Consumers are increasingly faced with the choice of necessity over luxury.</p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/12/24067370/microsoft-xbox-playstation-switch-games-future-hardware">Xbox’s Play Anywhere and Cloud streaming</a> attempt to get around that choice by taking advantage of devices consumers already have. “We are all seeking to meet people where they are,” said Matt Booty, president of Xbox game content and studios, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/10/24/arts/halo-playstation-microsoft-xbox.html">in an interview with the <em>New York Time</em>s</a>. And for the diehard fans who are still interested in having dedicated hardware, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/after-releasing-a-1000-handheld-microsoft-has-said-its-next-gen-xbox-console-is-going-to-be-a-very-premium-very-high-end-curated-experience">Xbox plans to have something for them too</a>. “The next-gen console is going to be a very premium, very high-end curated experience,” said Bond in her <em>Mashable</em> interview. Xbox has already debuted its pricey new ROG Ally and Ally X handhelds, and Bond’s comments suggest that the next console will be pricey and powerful.</p><div><p>But Xbox’s new strategy isn’t enough to save it completely if it can’t navigate the problems currently dragging it down. It shuttered a number of studios in the last two years including <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24151047/xbox-shuts-down-arkane-austin-tango-gameworks-microsoft">Arkane Austin and <em>Hi-Fi Rush </em>developer Tango Gameworks</a>. The company has cancelled its <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/696877/xbox-perfect-dark-everwild-cancelled-the-initiative-layoffs"><em>Perfect Dark </em>and <em>Everwild</em></a> projects. <em>Fable,</em> originally scheduled for a 2025 release, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/619046/microsoft-xbox-fable-game-delay-2026">has been delayed to 2026</a> while <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/713162/microsoft-satya-nadella-layoffs-memo">multiple rounds of layoffs at Microsoft</a> continue to gut its studios.</p></div><div><p>“We are all seeking to meet people where they are.”</p></div><div><p>It’s been <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/10/17447808/elder-scrolls-6-announcement-reveal-bethesda-e3-2018">six years since Bethesda announced <em>Elder Scrolls VI</em></a> with no word on when more information would be coming. The <em>Fallout </em>franchise is <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/04/fallout-games-continue-seeing-big-player-jumps-after-the-tv-series-success/">experiencing a soft renaissance</a> thanks to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24126474/fallout-review-amazon-prime-video">the Amazon show</a> but is missing something new for playersy other than <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/805612/fallout-4-anniversary-edition-release-date-trailer">updates to existing games</a> and<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/todd-howard-reassures-fallout-fans-as-fallout-day-2025-ends-without-a-brand-new-game-reveal-just-know-we-are-working-on-even-more"> a nod from Todd Howard that <em>Fallout 5</em> it’s still coming eventually</a>. And while folks are excited that the original <em>Halo</em> is getting an enhanced version for PS5, the latest entry, <em>Halo Infinite</em>, <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/halo-infinites-terrible-horrible-no-good-very-bad-year/">was a critical failure</a>. Being where the people are no matter if that’s on a PlayStation or a mobile device seems to be a winning strategy, but none of that matters if they have nothing good to play.</p></div><div><p>It doesn’t help that Xbox also has an image problem right now. A report in <em>Bloomberg</em> revealed that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/805280/microsoft-xbox-gaming-profit-targets-layoffs">an unusually high target profit margin of 30 percent</a> has led to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/789424/xbox-game-pass-premium-essentials-ultimate-price-increase-changes">unpopular price increases in Xbox Game Pass</a> and studio closures. Its new ASUS ROG Ally / ROG Ally X handhelds are priced at an eye-watering $600 / $1000 respectively for what seems to be <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/799698/xbox-ally-x-review-asus-microsoft-full-screen-experience">a work-in-progress device</a>. In a town hall meeting last year, Matt Booty said Xbox needs, “smaller games that give us prestige and awards,” <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/8/24152137/xbox-hi-fi-rush-tango-gameworks-matt-booty">the very day after it closed the studio responsible</a> for the short, popular, award-winning <em>Hi-Fi Rush</em>. Parent company Microsoft has been a target of the BDS movement, and has fired <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/774229/microsoft-fires-another-employee-over-palestine-protests">a number of employees</a> for <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/643670/microsoft-employee-protest-50th-annivesary-ai">speaking out against the company’s business contracts with the Israeli government</a> and accusing it of “using AI for genocide.” And earlier this week, when the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/807514/trump-white-house-dhs-ice-halo-image-meme-gamestop-console-wars">Department of Homeland Security used<em> Halo </em>in a racist ICE recruitment ad</a> on social media, Microsoft declined to comment.</p></div><p><em>Halo</em> coming to PlayStation isn’t the death of Xbox, but instead the clearest indication yet of the company’s shift in priorities. The console wars have long been over and console makers have to contend with a new reality where their biggest competitors aren’t only each other but also other attention and time-consuming platforms like TikTok, Instagram, <em>Fortnite</em>, and Roblox. Xbox can’t do that if its best offerings are siloed on the smallest install base of the three big consoles. And while it feels weird to see Master Chief Petty Officer John-117 someplace other than a Microsoft device, these moves are necessary to ensure the future of Xbox, whatever that ends up looking like.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTAy"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Ash Parrish</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/entertainment/809053/halo-playstation-xbox-multiplatform-strategy]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Ring ring. Ring Ring. Ring ring. The stern and bespectacled manager of Blake Manor's hotel appears for the eighth time. You're looking a bit narked there mate, I, the investigatorman, observe. Yes, he says yet again, I'm a bit stressed and busy on account of our telegram machine having gone kaput. Makes sense, I reply, can't think of any other reasons why you might be pissed off. He shuffles back into his office for exactly five seconds. Ring ring.</p>
<p>You're being haunted in the demo for spooky detective puzzler <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1395520/The_Sance_of_Blake_Manor/">The Séance of Blake Manor</a>, which released in full earlier this week, having had a demo up on Steam for a good while. However, I can confirm having taken in the first night of that demo that you're also give the power to do the haunting yourself.</p>

<p>The first thing that struck me as the intro sequence played were the Dracula vibes. You're not off to Transylvania, but the year is 1897 and private investigator Declan Ward is on his way to a remote manor in Ireland to investigate the disappearance of a young woman. He sits in a carriage examining the letter sent to him by an anonymous client, his brow furrowing in the way that only the brows of gothic horror protagonists can furrow.</p><p>He arrives at the manor and is greeted by pale stone walls amid a thunderstorm, because spooky tales like this are contractually obligated to lean into moody weather whenever possible. I jest, as for all its conventionality, the bit of Séance of Blake Manor I've played is a beautifully rendered and assembled love letter to classic spookage. Your first task is to work out whether the girl you're seeking, Evelyn Deane, has actually left the building.</p>
<p>To get there, you'll need to examine objects, quiz people, and gradually string together enough evidence to put together a hypothesis. Think something like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/return-of-the-obra-dinn">Return of the Obra Dinn</a>, but a bit less unorthodox in terms of styling. Signs up hint that a séance is being hosted at the hotel and I'm sure neither that nor the ghostly figures I keep seeing hint at anything remotely concerning going on round these parts.</p>
<p>Thus far, I've distracted myself by relentlessly pressing the hotel desk bell to summon the manager. I need to get a move on, because each little bit of investigating takes time off the clock, and you only get an hour of in-game time to solve this first mystery. Fine, I guess I'll do something useful and ask him about the creepy statue outside this time. Ring Ring.</p>

            <p>
It is more than commonplace these days for games to get some kind of delay, in fact it's surprising when the big boy names don't get one, like, say, GTA 6, which was meant to be out this year, but got <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gta-6-has-been-delayed-even-though-take-two-boss-kept-telling-everyone-it-wouldnt-be">pushed to 2026</a>. But it's rare that most games take more than 13 years to develop, an amount of time which retrofuture moonbase <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-horror-games">horror</a> game <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/routine">Routine</a> did in fact take. Except now its release is right around the corner!
</p>
<p>
Yes, yes, I know, you'll believe it when you see it, but as it currently stands developer Lunar Software says that the game is slated for release this coming December 4th. That's just over a month away, as long as the way calendars work hasn't changed since I started writing this, a closeness that would make it surprising if the game received further delays. So, perhaps you'll be able to actually experience the game for yourself by the end of the year!

<p>
If you've not heard of Routine before, it's one of those survival horror games, one where you explore an abandoned moonbase. There's mysterious, quite creepy robots that want to kill you (of course!), puzzles to solve (of course), and an aesthetic based around the idea of what the future might have looked like from an '80s perspective (of course?).
</p><p>
It took so long to make in part because the devs simply couldn't work on it for a while, both for financial reasons and a general unhappiness with where it was going. Routine did get a re-reveal <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/retrofuturistic-moonbase-horror-game-routine-is-actually-still-coming">back in 2022</a>, now with added support from publisher Raw Fury, with a couple of engine changes mixed in somewhere amongst the decade and a bit development period.
</p>
<p>
Doom 2016 composer Mick Gordon also worked on the soundtrack, but he did leave the project in 2024 due to scheduling issues - a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/606160/view/582778112589168937?l=english">recent Q&amp;A</a> explained that since that point the audio and audio implementation is being handled by "other people."
</p>
<p>
I do quite vibe with the aesthetic Routine offers up, I have quite a distaste for that clean, shiny look you see so much of in sci-fi these days, and retrofuturism always has that bit of texture I crave. But, well, it did take 13 years to make, so I have some reservations! Good thing I only learned about it from the re-reveal, so I don't have those 13 years of expectations like some of you might. On that note, good luck, Lunar Software!

<p>For reel</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Ever since <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/viewfinder">Viewfinder</a> was first announced for Switch earlier this summer, we've been eager to find out how the award-winning photo puzzle game would hold up on the Nintendo hybrid. Well, today we learned that we don't have long to wait.</p>
<p>Thunderful and Sad Owl Games have announced that Viewfinder will arrive on the Switch eShop on <strong>3rd December</strong>, slotting itself into the same week as <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/metroid_prime_4_beyond">Metroid Prime 4</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/octopath-traveler-0">Octopath Traveler 0</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/marvel-cosmic-invasion">MARVEL Cosmic Invasion</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/assassins-creed-shadows">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> and every other game under the sun, it seems.</p>
<p>What's worse, we're very excited to play this one too. Viewfinder sees you adventuring through a trippy land, using photos from your magical camera to alter perspectives and bend the laws of physics.</p>
<p>You want to cross a bridge? Take a photo of a bridge and line it up with your surroundings. You want to bypass a fence? Take a picture of an open space and step through it. It's the kind of gameplay that's difficult to visualise until you see it in action, but the above trailer provides a pretty comprehensive introduction.</p>
<p>Here's a brief game summary and a handful of screens from Thunderful:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In Viewfinder, you take photos, find paintings and sketches, then place them in the world to have them become a fabric of its reality, reshaping the environment around you. This unique mechanic delights in the way it plays with perception, evolving in surprising directions that keep players challenged with every new puzzle they encounter.</p>
<p>Along with the game’s engaging puzzles, Viewfinder welcomes you into a vibrant landscape with mysterious origins. Uncover the game’s secrets to find yourself unravelling a story that connects to our ever changing world, human experience and relationships, meaningful and misguided passion for change, and overcoming loss.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Viewfinder picked up award nominations and wins at the BAFTAs, The Game Awards, The Golden Joysticks and more after its release back in 2023, so we're very excited to hear that we won't have long to wait before we finally get our hands on it.</p>
<p>Bring on a busy December!</p>

If you miss the original <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dark-souls">Dark Souls</a> as much as you do the mottled grass textures of Hyrule Field, you will perhaps enjoy Mouseward, which is available now in pre-alpha form. It's a "soulslike collectathon" from the people behind <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/void-sols">Void Sols</a>, which Katharine (RPS in peace) <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/void-sols-is-an-atmospheric-and-highly-customisable-soulslike-for-people-who-are-rubbish-at-soulslikes">found to be</a> "an atmospheric and highly customisable Soulslike for people who are rubbish at Soulslikes". Mouseward seems similarly forgiving, for all its grim talk of death being "a lesson, not an end".

<p>
Yes, enemies respawn when you perish, but you get to keep all your accumulated progression points and spend them right away at the most recent campfire, care of a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-v-skyrim">Skyrim</a>-style astral level-up menu. Yes, the world looks a bit like Anor Londo, nested at the bottom of a well of Erdtrees, but it also looks like one of those N64 games you played, decades before you were exposed to the hellish clockwork of "deliberate, stamina-based combat". The visuals are at once chubby and cadaverous, like a mix of Ocarina of Time and Medieval. Here's a trailer.

The premise is that a "calamitous starfall" has brought a kingdom to ruin. You are a rodent Chosen Undead, rising from your grave to mend the world by tracking down every last scattered piece of star. Along the way, there will be blocking, backstabbing, archers, ambushes, secret entrances, plunging attacks, and melancholy, murderous badgers. In precisely that order, in fact.</p><p>I've just finished the opening bonfire loop in the pre-alpha, and I soulslike this a lot. Simple, tight controls, good atmosphere, and the enticing sense of a developer taking a genre back to formula - and possibly taking it somewhere new, once the tutorial segments are past. I'm interested to discover how the Fromsoft template might have to shapeshift to accommodate the collectathon focus and nods to fifth generation console action-platformers. Anyway, <a href="https://finite-reflection.itch.io/mouseward">you can find that Mouseward pre-alpha on Itch.io</a>. The game also has a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1188410/Mouseward/">Steam page</a>.

              <p>The infrastructure of the modern social media landscape means that every so often someone clips out a section of a modern blockbuster that <a href="https://kotaku.com/yellow-paint-debate-ff7-rebirth-demo-resident-evil-4-1851249608">uses bright yellow paint</a> to guide the player where to go and says something like, “This is why games suck now.”</p> <p>So it was with <a href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-review-ps5-1851276129"><em>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</em></a>, whose prodigious use of yellow hues to tag climbing ledges and other footholds for progressing the adventure sparked minor controversy back during launch. Was it a lazy shortcut or clever game design? The game’s director has now weighed in on the subject.</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">THE YELLOW PAINT VIRUS HAS INFECTED FF7 <a href="https://t.co/calN0dqHf4">pic.twitter.com/calN0dqHf4</a></p> <p>— Dave NewBlood (@DaveOshry) <a href="https://twitter.com/DaveOshry/status/1755469586999505137?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 8, 2024</a></p></blockquote>  <p>“I get there is a debate about that, whether that fits with that world or not, whether some people want it, some people don’t,” Naoki Hamaguchi <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/final-fantasy/oh-no-the-yellow-paint-debate-is-back-final-fantasy-7-rebirth-director-says-there-is-definitely-a-need-for-that-kind-of-thing-and-the-only-real-question-is-about-how-its-done/">told <em>Gamesradar</em></a> in a recent interview. “I think as a game, there is definitely a need for that kind of thing in a lot of ways. I think obviously different developers experiment, try different things about what works best, what fits best, the right way of doing that in their game.”</p>

 <p>He continued,</p> <blockquote><p>The need to guide players around from a gameplay perspective and show them what can be done, what they need to do, there are definitely times where that is needed. So I think obviously there is more of a debate about how it’s done, what level and what works. And there’ll still be people who say, “no, that doesn’t fit at all. We don’t like that.” That’s fine, but I think there is definitely a need there, and it’s something that is definitely worth looking at.</p></blockquote>   <p>“There’s definitely a need there” suggests Hamaguchi has seen enough people running around lost during playtesting to know that yellow paint, while far from the most elegant solution, is preferable to people getting stuck and frustrated. <em>Ghost of Yotei</em> is full of what one friend described as “bird poop” to mark its climbing ledges, and <em>Ninja Gaiden 4</em> is even more gratuitously slathered in liquid caution tape than <em>Rebirth</em>. None of us&nbsp;<em>want</em> yellow paint until <a href="https://x.com/ethangach/status/1764392813255410002">we absolutely&nbsp;<em>need</em></a> yellow paint.</p> <p>Such is the push and pull over immersion in hyper-realistic open-world RPGs (or in the case of <em>Ninja Gaiden 4</em>, visually messy linear corridors) that sometimes the best way to keep you ensconced in the fantasy is to momentarily shatter it with non-diegetic signposting. Hamaguchi’s position on the subject won’t put an end to the debate; we’ll see if the next <em>Final Fantasy VII</em> game implements a different solution or our old friend the yellow paint monster returns.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/days-of-the-week-ranked-from-best-to-worst-2000639864</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/days-of-the-week-ranked-from-best-to-worst.1338352/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The week is seven days long. <a href="https://youtu.be/kle2xHhRHg4">Don’t let The Beatles confuse you otherwise</a>. And if we were all just chilling in caves, eating bugs, and painting on the walls, the seven days wouldn’t matter. But that ain’t the world we live in. Instead, we have jobs and obligations. And that means the days that make up the week and its fun cousin, the weekend, are not all equal. Some days just suck, while others are so great we write songs about them.</p> <p>Anyway, we here at <em>Kotaku</em> decided it was time for someone to sit down and rank all seven days of the week. Finally, when pressured to provide an opinion on the concept of Thursday, you’ll have an answer you can use. Or when you ask ChatGPT about Thursday, it can scrape this post and provide our words to you. Whichever works, I guess. Let’s get to the ranking!</p>

 <h2>1. Saturday</h2> <p>Yeah, not a surprise, but Saturday is the best day of the week. For those of you who work a five-day week, Saturday is the crown jewel of the seven days. When you wake up Saturday, you are still feeling good from Friday, you don’t have to worry about your job, and you know that tomorrow is Sunday, another work-free day. Pure bliss. Nothing beats a perfect Saturday.</p>

 <h2>2. Friday</h2> <p>“Wait”! I hear you say. “Isn’t this a work day?” Yes, it is. But Fridays are both the end of the work week and the glorious start of the weekend. You have two days of doing nothing to look forward to, and one of those days is Saturday aka the best day. It’s hard not to feel excited and happy as Friday afternoon rolls around. It ain’t part of the weekend, but it’s still great.</p>

 <h2>3. Sunday</h2> <p>Sundays are strange. Sure, it follows Saturday, and that’s nice. And you don’t have to work, which is also nice. But Sundays are filled with dread. Your job is looming closer than ever. Monday is nearly here, and soon you’ll be back at your job. It seriously kills Sunday’s vibes. Still, the weekend is the weekend, so Sunday makes it into the top three.</p>

 <h2>4. Thursday</h2> <p>Oh, Thursday, you poor bastard. Doomed to forever be Friday-eve, you offer little more than the promise that soon things will get better. And that’s nice, but you are still another day of work sandwiched between more work. And that makes you a bit of a buzzkill. Sorry.</p>

 <h2>5. Wednesday</h2> <p>Wednesdays can often feel like the longest day of the week. You’re stuck in the middle of it all, two days removed from the fun of last weekend and 48 hours away from Saturday. This is the mountaintop of the week. From here, you can see all that came before and will come after, and while that provides a nice milestone, it’s also kind of a downer.</p>

 <h2>6. Monday</h2> <p>Many malign Mondays, often mocking the miserable start of the week. And make no mistake: Mondays suck. However, at least Monday follows the weekend directly. You’re still feeling good. Sure, the week is ahead of you, but the weekend is still a recent memory in your heart. It could be worse. It could be…</p> <h2>7. Tuesday</h2> <p>Fuck you, Tuesday. Sure, you are technically one step closer to the upcoming weekend than Monday, but that’s all this crappy day has to offer. There’s still so much week left and you’re already tired from Monday, a very bad day. Now you have to work more and you have three more days of this shit, too? Bleh. Gross. Horrible. Go to hell, Tuesday. That’s where you belong.</p>

I recently had a chance to sit down with the game’s design director, Virgil Watkins, to chat about the brutal nature of extraction shooters, how <i>Arc Raiders</i> seeks to appeal to folks skeptical of the genre’s hardcore nature, and, of course, whether my playstyle is toxic.</p> <p>Below is the transcript of our discussion about <i>Arc Raiders</i>’ approach to making the extraction shooter more friendly without compromising its intensity.</p> <p><i>This interview has been lightly edited for brevity and clarity</i>.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000639881" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000639881"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000639881">© Screenshot: Embark Studios / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p><b><i>Kotaku</i></b>: So in <i>Arc Raiders</i> I can sprint, I can walk, I can dodge out of the way of incoming fire, I can swap the camera on my shoulder. But why can’t I lay down?</p>

 <p><b>Virgil Watkins, Design Director on </b><b><i>Arc Raiders</i></b>: Well, I mean, one, it is a massive animation hurdle to get that to behave correctly in all the states, and then two, just kind of the way the game is balanced and the pacing of it. Having people default to proning and hiding kind of disrupts that.</p>

But overall, it just didn’t feel like it fit with the game loop we’ve got.</p>

 <p><b><i>Kotaku</i></b>: Gotcha. Okay. So extraction shooters tend to <a href="https://kotaku.com/ark-raiders-embark-studios-server-slam-2000637325">appeal to a very specific crowd</a>. Are you guys content with a game that mostly appeals to a hardcore niche?</p> <p><b>Read More:</b> <a href="https://kotaku.com/ark-raiders-embark-studios-server-slam-2000637325"><i>Arc Raiders</i> Is So Good I’m Worried It Will Completely Take Over My Life</a></p>

 <p><b>Watkins</b>: Once we pivoted to an extraction game, approachability became a key design tenet. Everything we have done up to this point tries to keep that in mind wherever possible, as long as it does not undermine that core extraction experience. We’ve put in a lot of systems that can act as a safety net or can soften the blow of failure. We have things like our quests, which many of them do not require you to extract.</p>

 <p>We have the safe pocket, which lets you put quest items that you might need in there and make incremental progress toward that goal. We have things in the meta game like our feats or trials which will come out with the launch of the game that, again, by progressing on some of these things, you can do it without extracting from the round, which is really nice to, even in that moment of failure, still understand that you’ve made some progress and earned something as a result.</p>

   <p>And then on the other side of it, we have what we kind of call “economic safety nets.” So we have the free loadout, which has no strings attached, you can just always choose it and have kind of a minimum quality of play while you’re using those kits. And then we have Scrappy the rooster, and he’ll give you a drip feed of materials so that you’re able to craft a few things as you go. And we’ve actually tuned him so that if you’re having a bad run of luck, he provides you with a touch more crafting materials compared to someone who’s being highly successful.</p>  <p>What we found in earlier tests is that highly successful players didn’t need [Scrappy as much]. But then the people who actually needed [the extra resources] were the ones who were getting left behind. So with all of that in mind, we wanted to shave off the those pointy edges [of the genre] so players who are maybe more nervous around this type of game or are apprehensive about how punishing it can be can fall back on these things and still feel like they’re capable of having fun and playing the game in the intended fashion as opposed to being down to just your knife and running it and going “I hope this works, I guess.”</p> <p><b><i>Kotaku</i></b>: Cool. Am I a bad person for camping the elevator to kill players as they try to extract?</p>

 <p><b>Watkins</b>: [laughs] I mean. No. It is a tactic. It’s been an interesting topic around that because we try to provide enough alternate ways out, and of course, the amount of extraction points reduces as the round goes on. You have the hatch keys that you can use to go out the quieter way. Of course, extraction camping is a concern in any of these games, but when we go and look at our telemetry for how players actually behave around extractions, the incidence rate, as far as we can tell, of extraction camping is incredibly low.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000639882" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000639882"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000639882">© Screenshot: Embark Studios / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>What you’ll tend to see is people making a decision, “oh, I hear [the elevator coming up]. Maybe I’ll go for it.” But in terms of like, literally just waiting there, it is a way to play and if you’re successful at it, I imagine you can get a decent bump in [loot] if you’re a good enough player to hold out there, but it tends to be that you’ll draw more attention [by camping]. Flares go off from people you’re fighting, drones get curious and they come investigating. So, hopefully things are tuned and positioned around those extractions enough where it’s not like, say, a perfect strategy, but it’s certainly an opportunistic one.</p>

 <p><b><i>Kotaku</i></b>: Where do you think the line is between aggressive playstyles and toxicity?</p> <p><b>Watkins</b>: Yeah, that’s a tough one, right? I think, because we have some social systems, we have emotes, we’ve got proximity voice, I certainly think players could, if they so chose, turn those into a toxic element. We’ve seen a couple of instances where people bring like 10 defibs [items used to revive another player quickly] and then revive people and then kill them again, so we put in a few things like being able to accept revives rather than being at the whim of someone else. You should always have some agency over yourself where you can choose to surrender instead of being subjected [to abuse].</p> <p>But yeah, of course it’s a risk once you give players this level of autonomy. There’s gonna be people who take advantage of it.</p>

 <p><b><i>Kotaku</i></b>: What’s your ideal run in a round of <i>Arc Raiders</i>?</p> <p><b>Watkins</b>: I tend to play in a non-hostile manner such that I won’t necessarily seek out fights, but I will take them if they start it with me. So I like trying to take a more contemplative approach. I’ll try to use where the drones are or aren’t, what the drones are doing and noticing, and I’ll use that information.</p> <p>I tend to be a very evasive player. Even if someone starts a fight with me, if I’m not very, very confident that I can win that fight in that moment, I will do enough to make them panic, and I will disengage and move somewhere else entirely, and maybe take the fight again from a different angle, or just disappear and let them run around and try to find me.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000639896" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000639896"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000639896">© Screenshot: Embark Studios / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>It’s kind of like Batman or something. I just disappear and then I’m doing something else, which I find really fun, trying to work around groups of players to still get what I need while taking fights when possible.</p> <p><b><i>Kotaku</i></b>: There are a lot of bushes and hiding spots in the game. At what point is a hiding spot unfair?</p>

 <p><b>Watkins</b>: What we’ve tried to do with our combat balance is that we have a longer TTK (time-to-kill) and alongside approachability, one of the primary tenets of designing this game is that you should always have time to understand and react to what is happening to you.</p> <p>And that does not guarantee that you will succeed in your reaction, but you should at least be capable of ascertaining what led to [a bad] situation and what could have changed the outcome next time you go into that situation.</p>

 <p>So on even footing, the way the TTK is balanced, if you’re full health and full shields, and so am I, if you attack me first, there’s a solid chance that I will probably be able to back away, disengage, do something to kind of mitigate that situation, because we really like when our fights are a lot of back and forth rather than just instantaneous.</p> <p>And of course, if you’re on super low health, then sure, you might get into a bad situation, but I think that comes along with trying to soften the blow of defeat. You should be capable of running again and learning in a more rapid manner.</p>

 <p>But I guarantee there’s gonna be places people find where they’re like, yeah, this is actually a really prime hiding spot, and I can do a lot from here and I can’t be touched. But that is where, again, things like noise traps, how much attention drones pay to noise and your movements and things, so wherever possible, we give a lot of clues to people moving into spaces or through spaces. If they’re paying attention, they can probably pick up on the fact that someone’s nearby, and even your characters once in close proximity to them, you’re hearing the foley of their outfit and their footsteps.</p> <p>So unless someone’s literally holding exactly still, we try to give as many opportunities as possible for you to be aware of others around you.</p> <p><b><i>Kotaku</i></b><i>: </i>How much time do you anticipate a player spending on <i>Arc Raiders</i> in a week?</p> <p><b>Watkins</b>: I would guess, just for the type of game this is and the type of player I expect to go on, it’s probably something on the order of like four to 10 hours would be my personal guess. There’s enough different things to do that you, you’re not literally just doing like one run over and over. You’re progressing a quest or crafting that new thing or going after this challenge.</p>

 <p><b><i>Kotaku</i></b>: Has anything surprised you during the technical tests?</p> <p><b>Watkins</b>: Certainly the clips coming of <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1oalxph/straight_out_of_a_horror_movie/?utm_source=embedv2&amp;utm_medium=post_embed&amp;embed_host_url=https://kotaku.com/ark-raiders-embark-studios-server-slam-2000637325">the Leaper going after people</a> have been very, very entertaining.</p>   <p>Like, of course, we already kind of knew what it could do, but I think so many of us [at Embark] are already familiar with how it maneuvers and the way it tries to engage that I think we almost inherently play around that just from the outset. Whereas players now are coming into contact with it for the first time and it’s causing them to lead it into and engage it in very bizarre locations that still work out to be very compelling.</p>   <p>And that was just kind of a happy coincidence. Like we did some changes to it so that it was more capable of navigating places like that and it just worked out now, and I’m pretty excited to see once players get it in the other maps with some other very unique geometry and setups, how it’s gonna surprise them.</p> <hr> <p><i>Arc Raiders</i> launches on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC on October 30, 2025.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>One of Nintendo’s anti-Palworld monster-capture patent applications has been rejected by the Japanese Patent Office as it “lacked an inventive step”.</p>



<p>For those unaware, Nintendo and The Pokémon Company have been battling PocketPair, the publisher of Palworld, in a patent infringement lawsuit for some time now. Most recently, we had heard a patent expert say that Nintendo is <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-is-so-wrong-it-hurts-about-mods-not-counting-as-prior-art-says-patent-expert/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">“so wrong it hurts”</a> regarding mods not being counted as prior art. Now, prior art is the main reason why Nintendo’s patent application was rejected in Japan. </p>



<h2 id="h-nintendo-s-anti-palworld-patent-rejected-due-to-prior-art-references-including-ark-monster-hunter-4-and-more">Nintendo’s Anti-Palworld Patent Rejected Due to Prior Art References Including ARK, Monster Hunter 4, and More</h2>



<p>According to a report by <a href="https://gamesfray.com/japan-patent-office-rejects-nintendo-application-relevant-to-palworld-dispute-cites-games-like-ark-as-prior-art-after-third-party-submission/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GamesFray</a>, Nintendo’s rejected patent application, 2024-031879, was a subclaim of one of the anti-Palworld monster-capture patents and a parent of another. It was dismissed for lack of an inventive step, meaning it did not involve an innovative idea that was not an obvious combination of two or more pre-existing concepts. Several games were cited as prior art references. </p>



<p>The patent office determined, through a third-party submission of prior art, that this step existed before Nintendo’s December 2021 priority date, with games such as Studio Wildcard’s ARK, Capcom’s Monster Hunter 4, Pocketpair’s Craftopia, Kantai Collection, and Pokémon GO using it. However, the refusal was non-final, meaning Nintendo can either abandon this patent or file a new patent application with amended claims. </p>

                <p>I think we can all agree that a good title makes a great first impression, especially in the busy landscape of video games. Look no further than <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2510490/The_Crazy_HyperDungeon_Chronicles/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Crazy Hyper-Dungeon Chronicles</a>, an indie RPG game from developer Fix-a-Bug whose satirical tone is quite obvious from the jump. Can you believe it had an even funnier name in Japan?</p><p>In an interview with <a href="https://www.gamespark.jp/article/2025/10/28/158848.html" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Game*Spark</a> (h/t <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/developer-who-accidentally-listed-game-as-shitty-dungeon-in-japan-says-steam-wishlists-skyrocketed-in-aftermath/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Automaton</a> for the translation and reporting) the game's developer Paolo Nicoletti admitted a hilarious anecdote from its development. Earlier this year, Nicoletti uploaded a demo for The Crazy Hyper-Dungeon Chronicles to Steam that boasted a hilarious, not to mention inappropriate, title instead.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PbyHmklgDWg" data-width="854" data-height="480">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/PbyHmklgDWg" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>The game's name had been localized to Kuso Dungeon, which translates (in the tamest language) to "Crap Dungeon." While <em>kuso </em>is a term that, throughout Asia at least, can broadly denote campiness or parody--making its usage here incredibly appropriate--it can also be misinterpreted to mean any number of Japanese curse words. You see where this is going now.</p><p>In the interview, Nicoletti shares that the unfortunate naming--the result of a less-than-professional-grade localization job--was a complete accident, but one that nonetheless bolstered the game's profile, making for "truly accidental marketing at its finest." Evidently, Japanese audiences started seeing The Crazy Hyper-Dungeon Chronicles pop up on their Steam feeds while bearing its laughably funny moniker, and as a result, the game went viral on X for a few days. Additionally, its Steam wishlists enjoyed a nice bump in the region.</p><p>Though the title has now been fixed, its seems like the incident has been a boon for Nicoletti and their team, who admitted that the developers were laughing alongside everyone else before quickly fixing the error. Now, The Crazy Hyper-Dungeon Chronicles and its developer are enjoying a great deal more positive buzz than they might have received with a more standard title.</p>

<p>"We're not using generative AI to develop Subnautica 2," Abramo wrote. "We have an 'AI system' in the game that is similar to ones that have always been in our games: the creature behavior trees."</p><p>Abramo then pointed players to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w1M4b6PneFk" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a September 16 developer vlog</a>, which went into detail about the "creature behavior trees" the team uses in the game. According to AI gameplay lead engineer Antonio Muñoz Gallego, Unknown Worlds Entertainment uses "classic AI," a form of the tech that "improves the hero trees" to make creatures more reactive to player inputs and environmental happenings. It's all a very tech-y way of saying that Subnautica 2's AI is built by humans rather than code generated by other forms of code.</p><p>As such, Abramo said that players can rest assured knowing that the developers won't use generative AI for Subnautica 2 because the team's workflow has already been established.</p><p>"It is very unlikely that that will change," Abramo continued. "We already have a lot of our teams, pipelines, and systems set up. But, ultimately, our relationship with Krafton is the same as it has always been. They provide us access to valuable tools and resources, and we choose which are the right fit for our projects."</p><p>This comes after Krafton Inc.--publisher of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-callisto-protocol/" data-ref-id="5000-523747">The Callisto Protocol</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/playerunknowns-battlegrounds/" data-ref-id="5000-462692">PUBG</a>, the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/subnautica/" data-ref-id="5000-244763">Subnautica</a> games, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/tango-gameworks-started-work-on-hi-fi-rush-2-before-microsoft-closure/1100-6526814/" data-ref-id="1100-6526814">Tango Gameworks' upcoming Hi-Fi Rush 2</a>--announced <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pubg-publisher-invests-70-million-to-become-ai-first-company/1100-6535653/" data-ref-id="1100-6535653">a $70 million investment into generative AI</a> to become a leading force for the controversial technology in the games industry.

            <p>A new selection of downloadable games are coming to PlayStation Plus this November, as a modern horror classic gets cycled out alongside the Halloween season.</p>
<p>The new games coming to PlayStation Plus in November are Stray, Totally Accurate Battle Simulator, and EA WRC 24. They'll be taking the place of Alan Wake II, Cocoon, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/goat-simulator-3">Goat Simulator 3</a> on the 4th November</p>
<p>These games will be downloadable for any PlayStation Plus user with any version of the subscription service, including those with the basic essential tier. So be sure to grab 'em while they're available.</p>

<p>Diving a bit into the games up for grabs, Stray is a beloved adventure game that places you in the shoes (or paws?) of a cat as they explore a gorgeous cyber cityscape. It's available for download on PS4 and PS5, and is for sure the spotlight addition to this month's line-up.</p><p>You've then got Totally Accurate Battle Simulator. This is a wobbly large-scale battle simulator where you line up armies of red and blue jiggly forces and watch them clash to humorous effect. It sounds strange but it's a great laugh, as are all the Totally Accurate games from Landfall. Fun fact, Landfall are one half of the indie dream team that made Peak, which should be an indicator of charm. You can download this for PS4 and PS5.</p>
<p>Finally, EA WRC 24 is the latest and, sadly, one of the last racing games Codemasters made before falling on hard times recently. A brilliant rally racing game, this high-intensenty title will have you compete in seasons and get behind the wheel of various meticulously recreated race cars. WRC stands as a fantastic game today, even as mass layoffs hit Codemasters, so give it a download and show some love to the folks who made it. You can download EA WRC 24 via PlayStation Plus on the PS5.</p>

			<p>While AI can streamline the video game development process, it would never be able to create a very good Grand Theft Auto game, according to Take-Two's CEO Strauss Zelnick, as current models lack something very important.</p>



<p>Speaking about AI usage in video game development at <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/10/28/can-ai-create-next-grand-theft-auto-take-two-interactive-ceo-says-no.html">CNBC's Technology Executive Council Summit</a> in New York on October 28, the CEO of Rockstar Games' parent company made it clear that the current models would be unable to create a very good Grand Theft Auto game. For starters, using AI to create intellectual property creates issues not only with protecting one's own but also with respecting other's properties.</p>



<p>Even if there were no constraints on AI, it wouldn't be possible to create a very good Grand Theft Auto game, according to Strauss Zelnick. <em>"Could we push a button tomorrow and create an equivalent to the ‘Grand Theft Auto’ marketing plan? The answer is no. A, you can’t do that yet, and B, I am of the view that you wouldn’t end up with anything very good. You end up with something pretty derivative,"</em> he said.</p>



<p>What would prevent AI from making a very good Grand Theft Auto game is the lack of creativity, which is inherent to all AI models. These predictive models based on data sets of old information can work relatively well in certain fields, but not in the creation of the <em>"multi-layered universes that Take-Two’s video games have become known for,"</em> Strauss Zelnick said.</p>



<p><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">"The team’s creativity is extraordinary, and what Rockstar Games tries to do, and so far has done over and over again, is create something that approaches perfection. There is no creativity that can exist by definition in any AI model, because it is data-driven,”</em> Zelnick concluded.</p>



<p>Although the Take-Two CEO makes an extremely valid point, the video game industry seems divided on the usage of AI. <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-is-pushing-employees-to-use-ai-for-everything-including-producing-code-requiring-manual-fixing/">EA is pushing heavily for its employees to use AI for basically every task</a>, ranging from coding to QA, while others, such as <a href="https://wccftech.com/super-smash-bros-creator-development-ai/">Super Smash Bros. series creator Masahiro Sakurai </a>and <a href="https://wccftech.com/hideo-kojima-sees-creating-together-with-ai-way-stay-one-step-ahead/">Metal Gear and Death Stranding creator Hideo Kojima</a>, see it as a tool to make large game development sustainable in the future and enhance creativity.</p>

              <div data-gpnav="columns"> <p><em>New World: Aeternum</em> stood out as an impressive milestone for Amazon Game Studios. A hit MMO at launch, it will now be remembered as an unfortunate sacrifice on the altar of the tech giant’s coming AI transformation. The company has announced that <em>New World</em> <a href="https://kotaku.com/new-world-amazon-mmo-shutting-down-servers-2026-layoffs-new-content-2000639761">will get no more new content</a>. It’s not shutting down this instant, but it seems unlikely to last beyond 2026. Fans are understandably upset, and they’re current plastering the game’s Steam review section with colorful critiques of Amazon.</p> </div>  <p>A victim of the company’s newly announced retreat from AAA game development as it culls a <a href="https://kotaku.com/amazon-layoffs-lord-rings-mmo-tomb-raider-2000639620">staggering 14,000 employees</a> from its payrolls, <em>New World</em> was deemed “no longer sustainable to continue supporting…with new content updates.” The reaction on the game’s Steam page has been swift, with over 1,000 new negative reviews since Amazon informed fans it was pulling the plug.</p>  <div role="heading" aria-level="1"> <p>“Recently started playing was enjoying it, now its being shut down because Amazon being Amazon,” wrote one Steam reviewer. “Recently bought some marks of fortune to buy some in game cosmetics for a game I thought was gonna be a long lasting live-service MMORPG, especially after the general positive reception of <em>Nighthaven</em> and they are shutting down the servers lmao,” wrote another.</p> </div>  <p>There’s never a good moment to reveal you’re abandoning your flagship MMO, but the news comes just a couple of weeks after the game’s season 10 Nighthaven update went live. That and the <em>Rise of the Angry Earth</em> expansion needed to access it are being made free to all players, but no one who’s recently spent money on the game buying content will be getting any refunds.</p>  <p>After drifting below 10,000 concurrent players on Steam during the last year,&nbsp;<em>New</em>&nbsp;<em>World</em> saw a decent resurgence this month, peaking at over 50,000 concurrents after the new content went live. Some fans are blaming corporate greed rather than any unique live-service failings on the part of<em> New World</em> and the MMO’s developers.</p>  <div role="heading" aria-level="1"> <p>“Was fun but then amazon killed it,” a player wrote in the review section. “Bought it the same day the announced it was shutting down, screw you amazon,” wrote another. A third didn’t hold back either. “An amazing game that finally got footing and headwind only to be shutdown because Amazon wants more AI,” they wrote. “No seriously that’s the reason from Amazon for the the mass layoffs that shuttered the studio. Don’t buy it it’ll be shutdown in 8 months.”</p> </div>

                <p>With the leap of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/halo-is-coming-to-playstation-for-the-first-time/1100-6535696/" data-ref-id="1100-6535696">Halo to PlayStation 5</a>, some observers have facetiously declared <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gamestop-declares-the-console-wars-officially-over-with-halo-on-ps5/1100-6535718/" data-ref-id="1100-6535718">the console wars to be over</a>. Despite rumors that Microsoft is getting out of the console business, the company is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-president-shares-new-details-on-next-gen-xbox-console/1100-6532502/" data-ref-id="1100-6532502">working with AMD on future consoles and devices</a>. Now, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella has shared some thoughts about the next Xbox, which may indicate that it will be more like a PC.</p><p>"We want to do innovative work on the system side, on the console and PC. It's kind of funny that people think about the [Xbox] console and PC as two different things," said Nadella during an appearance on <a href="https://twitter.com/tbpn/status/1983248873335468142" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">TBPN</a>. "We built a console because we wanted to build a better PC, which could then perform for gaming. So I kind of want to revisit some of that conventional wisdom. But at the end of the day, console has an experience that is unparalleled ... I'm really looking forward to the next console."</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://twitter.com/tbpn/status/1983248873335468142" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">The consoles wars are now over.

A separate report lays the potential blame on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsofts-sky-high-profit-goals-for-xbox-may-be-doing-more-harm-than-good-report/1100-6535643/" data-ref-id="1100-6535643">Microsoft's sky-high profit goals</a>, which some observers believe are harming the company.</p><p>Earlier this month, Microsoft unveiled its latest campaign to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-wants-ai-and-voice-control-to-be-an-even-bigger-part-of-windows/1100-6535491/" data-ref-id="1100-6535491">integrate AI and voice controls into every Windows 11</a> machine. Xbox box gaming boss Phil Spencer also came out and said that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-primarily-uses-ai-for-security-so-far-says-phil-spencer/1100-6535672/" data-ref-id="1100-6535672">the company uses AI for security purposes</a>, rather than for creative decisions when making games. But it remains to be seen if that continues.</p>

            <p>Capcom has released its latest bi-annual financial report, revealing among other interesting tidbits that Monster Hunter: Wilds sales have drastically fallen. In fact, it has fallen so much that Monster Hunter: Rise outsold it in recent months.</p>
<p>The financial report, <a href="https://www.capcom.co.jp/ir/english/data/pdf/explanation/2025/2nd/explanation_2025_2nd_01.pdf">which can be read in full on the official Capcom website</a>, shows a table on page six breaking down game sales across the first half of this financial year. This table shows that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> has sold 637,000 units across all platforms so far in the financial year. For comparison, the prior game in the series Monster Hunter: Rise has sold 643,000.</p>
<p>Why has Monster Hunter; Wilds suffered such a loss in momentum? <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-is-capcoms-fastest-selling-game-ever">Well, while the game started off incredibly popular</a>, substantial technical issues following its release <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/after-suffering-an-influx-of-overwhelmingly-negative-steam-reviews-can-capcom-turn-around-monster-hunter-wilds-with-the-upcoming-title-update-2">hampered its continued growth</a>. Capcom's president even put blame on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-sales-scuppered-by-high-cost-of-ps5-says-capcom-president">how expensive the PS5 was for lacklustre console sales</a>.</p>

<p>The fiscal report does contain far more interesting nuggets, even if you stayed glued to the aforementioned table. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/devil-may-cry-5">Devil May Cry 5</a> continues to sell well all these years later, racking up a lifetime sales figure of 10,784,000 which is not shabby whatsoever. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/street-fighter-6">Street Fighter 6</a> is doing well too, selling an additional 1,085,000 units so far in the financial year, indicating continued interest in the competitive fighting game.</p><p>Of course, the table is packed full of various modern <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/resident-evil-games-order">Resident Evil games</a>, each seeming to have substantial staying power. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/resident-evil-village">Resident Evil Village</a> is the top performer so far in the year, and even the Resident Evil 3: Remake (which personally speaking is a tad underrated) pulled off 697,000 sales this far into the financial year.</p>
<p>Though for a more macro look at how Capcom is doing, all one needs to do is take a look at page two of the presentation, where major takeaways are listed as: "Revenue and profit grew year-on-year across all segments.  Achieved highest-ever total and catalog unit sales for a H1 period. Favorable performance in Amusement Equipments business." So while Monster Hunter: Wilds isn't doing so hot, the company as a whole seems to be doing quite well.</p>

            <p>In their first set of financial results since <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/control-studio-remedy-issues-profit-warning-due-to-weak-sales-of-fbc-firebreak/">issuing a profit warning</a> and switching CEOs earlier this month, Remedy have revealed that they're moving resources away from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fbc-firebreak">FBC: Firebreak</a> amid a "sense of urgency", and aiming to rely on established series <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/alan-wake">Alan Wake</a> and Control delivering hits which'll shore up their commercial fortunes in the long-term.</p>

<p>In these <a href="https://storage.googleapis.com/inderes-widgets-prod-assets/remedy/attachments/a5ed948a-b1e3-4b08-aab9-1bae5cf6d33a/remedy-q3-2025-business-review.pdf">latest financial results</a>, Remedy reported a loss of €16.4 million between July and September 2025, in contrast to the €2.4 million profit it made the same time last year, when <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/alan-wake-2">Alan Wake 2</a> had been out of the door less than a year. Remedy co-founder Markus Mäki - who <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/remedy-ceo-tero-virtala-steps-down-after-nine-years">stepped into the role of interim CEO</a> last week, replacing former CEO Tero Virtala not long after Firebreak's sales disappointment - says his job's been "to raise the bar and the sense of urgency across the organization, and to drive stronger results".</p>
<p>So, given Firebreak's sales have only gone up "marginally" as the studio have delivered updates, they're unsurprisingly shifting chess pieces elsewhere. "We continue working on features which enhance player value, and which are justified by our updated long-term sales expectations," the results doc reads. "We have moved development resources to our other in-development titles while respecting our communicated roadmap for FBC: Firebreak."</p>
<p>As for what the studio are banking on to arrest their number slumpage, Mäki says they plan on making big hit games that people like. More concretely, he indicated Remedy's focus in the short-term and until 2030 is mainly to lean on their established series, Alan Wake and Control, to keep growing and deliver these hits. Though, the fact the studio'll be "carefully balancing our product risk" with the need to create "new experiences" suggests future spin-offs being relied on as hits probably won't be as big a leaps into the unknown as Firebreak was, being Remedy's first crack at multiplayer.</p><p>For now, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/control-2">Control 2</a> and the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/remedy-are-remaking-max-payne-1-2">Max Payne 1 and 2 remake</a> being developed alongside Rockstar remain in the works. There's also an unnamed new project listed as being in the proof of concept stages at Remedy. Given the emphasis on their plan to rely on Control and Alan Wake, as well as need to stick to proveable hits, it doesn't seem too much of a stretch to imagine it could be something Wake-ish. Don't quote me on that though, we'll have to wait and see whenever this mysterious thing's revealed.</p>
