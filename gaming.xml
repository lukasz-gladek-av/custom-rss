			<p>New details for Slitterhead were revealed today, alongside new screenshots that provide a new look at some of the game's characters, skills and the Kowlong Slums stage.</p>
<p>In the game developed by <a href="https://bokehgamestudio.co.jp/en/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bokeh Game Studio</a>, a new development studio founded by the creator of the Silent Hill and Siren series Keiichiro Toyama, players will get to encounter special characters like Julee and Alex, known as Rarities, who have a strong synchronization with protagonist Hyoki and grant access to a variety of skills, including Rarity Skills, whose effects are become active by just having them, and Active Skills which are activated by using the skill button and can be carried over even when possessing ordinary humans.</p>
<p>Besides showing more of the Rarities and skills, Bokeh Game Studio also shared a new look at one of the Slitterhead's stages, the Kowlong Slums. This gigantic slum is slated for demolition, and its residents are forced to leave. Many, however, refuse to do so, making it the perfect location for the horrors upon which the experience is focused.</p>

The score, composed by Wilbert Roget, II, is absolutely filled with pomp. Everything is here, from the main theme that I’ve grown used to hearing while my screen idles to tracks that play while you’re fighting against either the Terminids or Automatons, <em>Helldivers</em>’ enemy forces.<br></p><p>Listening through the soundtrack has been a great reminder of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-community-humor-1851282592&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-community-humor-1851282592">how essential <em>Helldivers 2</em>’s score is to the fantasy it’s successfully portrayed</a></span> since it was released this February. For example, I’ve always taken for granted how lowkey and tech-y the music in your starship is, which feels like the right call for an area that gradually gets upgraded and fleshed out as you advance through the ranks and unlock new stratagems, buffs, and weapons. It stands in stark contrast to the triumphant music that plays as you jump into a pod and are <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-malevelon-creek-liberated-1851379768&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-malevelon-creek-liberated-1851379768">dropped onto the surface of a planet as part of a “liberation” effort</a></span>. The score is great at instilling a false sense of pride—which is perfectly in-line with the game’s <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-starship-troopers-movie-disney-1851269272&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-starship-troopers-movie-disney-1851269272"><em>Starship Troopers </em>influence</a></span>—as you take on hellish missions in the name of a clearly fascist regime and get ragdolled and eviscerated over and over again by enemies.</p><p>Though, I’d like to bring particular attention to the track titled “Super-Earth National Anthem” because why the hell is it so good? I’ve played <em>Helldivers 2 </em>quite a bit, and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-six-months-later-arrowhead-1851617332&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-six-months-later-arrowhead-1851617332">covered it even more than that</a></span>, but I had never heard this thing until today, despite evidence suggesting players found it in-game a long time ago. Here’s just a sample of the batshit propaganda Super-Earth passes for an anthem:</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>“Freedom must reign over every last star, through citizen’s blood spilled in our righteous wars / Honor their deaths, do your part for the cause</p><p>Steadfast support of our regime is how humankind will reign supreme / No questions or doubts shall be allowed, tractors will all be disavowed”</p></blockquote><p>Now imagine that being sung by a beaming choir. Or worse, picture kids singing that every morning before class, or at their graduation ceremonies. I’m no fan of the American national anthem, but at least we aren’t made to explicitly sing about “citizen’s blood spilled in our righteous wars.” I need a documentary about life in the Super-Earth colonies immediately, this is truly horrifying stuff. On the bright side, you can now air music like this from your car every Fourth of July if you so choose. Ain’t democracy grand?<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/krafton-ceo-on-why-the-callisto-protocol-struggled/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>The Callisto Protocol struggled because it didn’t have a “gameplay edge”. That’s what Changhan “CH” Kim, CEO of the game’s publisher Krafton” said in a recent interview.</p>



<p>Speaking with <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/krafton-ceo-says-the-callisto-protocol-suffered-because-it-lacked-a-gameplay-edge-" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Game Developer</a>, Kim talked about The Callisto Protocol being the first AAA single-player game from the studio and developer Striking Distance. He said that there was some “difficulty” within as to deciding whether the direction they were going in was the right way.</p>



<p>“This is a single-player narrative game [that’s] visually stunning and a high-quality game to look at,” he said. “Despite that, the game’s core is the gameplay. Gameplay comes first is what I learned with&nbsp;The Callisto Protocol. </p>



<p>“It could be the most high-quality game in the world, but if you don’t have a gameplay edge–if you can’t differentiate your gameplay from your competitors–it doesn’t work out. I was able to reaffirm that.”</p>



<p>He then told Game Developer that he understands that gameplay has to innovate with games in order for players to have interest. A new experience is what will help a game’s success.</p>



<p>“This allows for new experiences within the game, and even though [The Callisto Protocol] is a narrative game, a single-player game, you need to be able to offer a good gameplay experience,” Kim said. “You can’t do that without those elements.”</p>



<p>As far as moving forward, Kim says that the market is tough to guess what could work and what may not. Still, Krafton and the developers it works with will “continuously try these new creative ideas”.</p>



<p>“Not everything will succeed, but one of these days we might just hit another PUBG,” he said. “This is a very bottom-up approach, I would say, and it’s not what a lot of big companies are attempting right now.”</p>



<p>Do you agree with the reasoning behind the struggles of The Callisto Protocol when it launched in 2022? Let us know in the comments, and join the discussion in the official <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Forums</a>. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/group-photo-the-editors-of-game-developer-discuss-their-favorite-game-photos<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-module="content" data-testid="article-base-body-content"><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>For Photography Week, Game Developer has showcased new interviews, essays, and deep dives demonstrating the creative and technical process behind photography games and photo modes. In this group blog, join us as our editors ruminate on the photos and photo modes they love and explore their evolution and their value within the medium.</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It’s so funny how it doesn’t matter if you’re a traditional photographer, or just like taking a lot of screenshots in video games—looking back at your early work is always so humbling. I recall taking these photos (including the header of this article) in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Fallout: New Vegas</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and being proud of them. So proud, in fact, that I hung on to them for years. It wasn’t actually that hard to find them, only one external storage device deep on my PC, 14 years and at least four hard drives later.&nbsp;</span></p><p>The Western Sky mod for Fallout: New Vegas deeply altered the day and night cycle, rendering certain hours of the day pitch black, both a strategic and photographic opportunity.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I remember that taking photos in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Fallout: New Vegas</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> was as much about enjoying the scenery as it was spending more time in the game. I didn’t actually like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>New Vegas</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> at first; it wasn’t as dark as </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Fallout 3</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and I wasn’t fond of how its cool greens and grays were replaced by the bright orange palette of the Mojave. A Nexus mod, Western Sky, actually changed my mind, adding dynamic lighting and weather effects that turned the environment hostile but also strangely beautiful, with pitch-black nights and intense blue skies and rad storms that would pummel the Courier into the sand.&nbsp;The mod not only had the effect of making the game more strategically interesting, but visually as well.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It was the early Bethesda Fallout games that gave me the training wheels to move onto “real” photography; back then you’d use the console commands to quickly detach the camera and remove clipping, and with that, capture moments from the game at more dynamic angles. While not exactly as sophisticated of the photo modes today, or heck, even the </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Bethesda</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> photo modes of today, it’s an experience I remember fondly for how much it did teach me about the basics. Take away the ability to consider fundamental things like depth of field and you’re left no option but to be in the moment and take in every detail within a tiny field of view that occupies that microscopic sliver of time. That it’s in a video game doesn’t make at any less an exercise in observation.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">That observation process can offer a lot of solitude and contemplation. It demands rumination and self-reflection even as it commands you be present to the exclusion of everything else. Maybe that’s why taking photos in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Fallout: New Vegas</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> felt so good. Documenting the journey of the Courier as they crossed so much desert on foot and encountered so much uncertainty and decay and emptiness became a mirror not just of their loneliness and isolation but also my own.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">These days I still take the occasional snap in Fallout. F</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>allout 76</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> has a dedicated photo mode that combines traditional camera and photo editing features, letting you control depth of field, field of view, and lighting, and add player poses or picture frames. Unlike </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>New Vegas</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> or </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Fallout 3</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, it’s also easy to get more variety in your shots, as </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>76</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> is comprised of regional environments with dramatically different enemies, plants, weather and lighting.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">But the improvements haven’t resulted in me taking more photos, despite how easy it would be to create my own scene with the game’s workshop tools. Maybe it’s just harder to find a moment of contemplation in a crowded live service game with so many random people looking over your shoulder.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Still, it’s nice to remember how mods and PC console commands paved the way. —Holly Green</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I've recently fallen all the way down into a </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Dredge</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">-shaped Abyss. While I've been excited about the game ever since its launch last year, I never put much time into it until the last couple of weeks—and knowing photo week was coming up gave me the perfect excuse to dive in fully.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I love the game—its compelling core loop of fishing, exploring, building your boat up to get better at all of the above (spiced with dodging unfathomable horrors), its slow burn Eldritch horror story and impeccable, salty vibes. It's also often a weirdly beautiful game despite its subject matter and increasingly horrific sea life. There's an aching loneliness to the player's journey that is constantly pierced by the ambient (not-mutated) critters splashing about: sea turtles shimmering in pairs, dolphins bounding playfully, whales surfacing briefly, subjecting you to a tiny little touch of majesty every now and then.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It works in conjunction with the sky, the sea, the rough hewn little bits or architecture that people have eked out in this nightmare world. Your little boat, always a bit cartoonish and never a match for anything that lurks in the deep—but you keep going anyway. And every now and then, you get treated to a view like this one.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It all seems to say sure, you're just a tiny speck in this terrifying, unknowable ocean. And on top of nature's indifference, there are creatures in the deep waiting to get at you, for harboring some of that forbidden knowledge humans should never have. But at least you aren't alone out there in infinity. Some beauty still remains. —Danielle Riendeau</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Photography is a beautiful lie. Every photo you've ever seen isn't a snapshot of reality, it's light channeled through a lens, slapped onto a sensor or strip of film, and processed before becoming the image you see in the real world. That image is shaped by the aperture of the lens, the speed that the shutter clicks, and the "stock" of the medium the light lands on.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I love that lie. In-game photography tools make it so easy to easy play with, and it brings players close to the little lies that make games possible. When you freeze the world and muck around with artificial camera settings, you catch things developers don't want to be seen. But instead of killing the fantasy, it invites you to play with the lie yourself—especially when posing a character. I love juking the controls before smashing the "photo mode" button to move a character into the right pose, using an in-between frame to turn a simple transitional motion into a bit of storytelling that captures the "vibe" of the game.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I call it a "lie," like it's a bad thing, but everyone knows a games are full of lies. Photo modes bring players in on the lie, and remind us these lies aren't meant to harm, but to help us speak in a language that goes beyond words. And I just think that's kind of neat. —Bryant Francis</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Authors</h2><div><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Community Editorial Coordinator, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Holly Green has been in games media for fifteen years, having previously worked as a reporter and critic at a variety of outlets.

            <p>It's a pirate's life for me, and it's a pirate's life for Goro Majima, recurring eyepatched anti-hero of the used-to-be-called-Yakuza series. He's the star of the just-announced <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/like-a-dragon-pirate-yakuza-in-hawaii">Like A Dragon: Pirate Yakuza In Hawaii</a>, a game I can only applaud for the brazen straightforwardness of its title. Whatever Sega were drinking when they signed off on Metaphor: ReFantazio, they were not drinking when they signed off on this. They were definitely drinking <em>something</em>, though.

<p>Pirate Yakuza In Hawaii begins with Goro washing up on the beach of a strange island, much like Link in Link's Awakening, except that Goro has a full back tattoo and swanky leather trousers, and there is a small tiger wearing a neckerchief. [SCENE MISSING] Now Goro is wearing a tricorn hat and steering a galleon. There is mention of Madlantis. [SCENE MISSING] Now there are ninjas in bullet-proof vests, and Goro is throwing cutlasses like boomerangs.</p>
<p>I think this is still set in approximately the present day? The combat looks to be real-time. The key thing, the important thing is that Goro is having a lot of fun, bless him.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3061810/Like_a_Dragon_Pirate_Yakuza_in_Hawaii/">Steam page</a> helps clear the mists a little. Look, it's got a full-blown gosh-dang ship-sailing element! "Assemble a one-of-a-kind crew while upgrading your ship as you explore the open sea and forge your legend in the cannon fire of foes, unexpected friendships, and immense riches made along the way," explains the blurb. You can expect real-time cannon battles, boarding actions and hidden treasure islands.</p>
<p>As for the combat, there's a choice of at least two fighting styles. "With 'Mad Dog' style, utilize speed, agility, and flair to deliver precise yet powerful blows that stun your enemies into submission," the blurb goes on. "Or make enemies walk the plank with the 'Sea Dog' style that has you dual-wielding short swords and deploying tricky pirate tools to kick some serious booty." Three bits of pirate slang in one sentence, not bad. I can do better though: sink me, this is a haul worth hornswaggling a dungbie for, or my name's not Davey Jones's Locker.</p>
<p>Like A Dragon: Pirate Yakuza In Hawaii is out on 28th February 2025. I think I liked Goro better when he was an impossibly suave nightclub manager, but I welcome this new nautical phase in his career. If you're new to the sprawling LAD series, you might like to consult Ed Thorn's piece on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/what-order-should-you-play-the-yakuza-games">the right order in which to play them</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The process by which players do that has changed over the years, with the <em>Mass Effect </em>games reading your old saves and <em>Dragon Age </em>getting a separate app to craft your world state for <em>Inquisition</em>. <em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</em> will handle this differently, allowing you to <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-dreadwolf-keep-choices-import-1851532520&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-dreadwolf-keep-choices-import-1851532520">make a few key decisions in the character creator</a></span> that reflect choices made in <em>Inquisition </em>before you get started on your next journey. Still, for all its apparent concern with making players feel like their decisions have lasting impact, BioWare’s track record is arguably a bit spotty in this regard, and at times the studio has outright undone the effects of major choices players have made. At a preview event earlier this month John Epler, creative director on <em>the Veilguard</em>, talked a bit about the studio’s philosophy for handling these decisions.<br></p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196742" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="What Is Dragonsplague?

This is a game about your decisions as a player. [...] The philosophy is we never want to invalidate your choices. And if we don’t feel we can do something respectful of the choice we made, we oftentimes just don’t necessarily reference it. [...] So we never want you to feel like your world is being invalidated.”</p><p>Most of <em>The Veilguard</em> takes place in the northern regions of the <em>Dragon Age </em>universe, whereas previous games have been primarily in southern areas like the countries of Ferelden and Orlais. As such, Epler said a lot of the decisions you made in previous <em>Dragon Age </em>games won’t come into play, which means the studio didn’t have to write around or undo choices from your past adventures. This was also true of <em>Mass Effect: Andromeda</em>, which took place in a different galaxy and only asked you if Commander Shepard, the protagonist of the first three games, was a man or woman.</p><p>The term “canon,” however, has also come to mean something different both with regard to BioWare games and the broader video game fandom, in that some people have taken to calling the “default” state you get when you boot up a game without changing something “canon.” However, this is a bit of a misnomer, and at least with BioWare, it sounds like a misconception within the community. <em>The Veilguard</em>, for example, lets you recreate your Inquisitor, the protagonist from <em>Dragon Age: Inquisition</em>, and import some choices from previous games. When you boot up the character creator for the hero, the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/zevwardens/status/1836849390159548744&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/zevwardens/status/1836849390159548744" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">default version is an elven woman</a></span>. To long-time fans, this seems like it might be a nod to the only character who can enter a romance with Solas, the <em>Inquisition</em>-party-member-turned-<em>Veilguard</em>-antagonist. But this is just a default state for anyone who doesn’t care to change things to match their own world state, not a “canon” decision BioWare has deemed the “correct” choice.</p><p>With the studio recently working on both <em>The Veilguard </em>and the upcoming <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/mass-effect-teaser-n7-day-andromeda-1850999958&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/mass-effect-teaser-n7-day-andromeda-1850999958">fifth <em>Mass Effect </em>game</a></span>, there’s been concern among some fans about just how the studio would navigate incorporating choices from earlier games. While we still know very little about the next <em>Mass Effect</em>, when it was revealed that it would feature a character from the original trilogy in squadmate Liara T’Soni, fans questioned whether or not the next game might make a hard decision about the state of the universe after <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/mass-effect-3-ending-shepard-catalyst-crucible-choice-1851313435&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/mass-effect-3-ending-shepard-catalyst-crucible-choice-1851313435"><em>Mass Effect 3</em>’s galaxy-changing ending</a></span>. Some feel that BioWare just making a single decision and treating it as canon would be a simple solution, but I have been arguing for years that anyone who says BioWare should just pick an ending and make it canon for simplicity’s sake is not thinking hard enough. When meaningful choices are a fundamental part of a studio’s legacy, it feels flippant to say, “BioWare should just apply ending B to everyone’s story and call it a day.” So it’s comforting, as a long-time fan with a lot of investment in his characters and choices, to hear Epler so plainly say that’s not what the <em>Dragon Age </em>team is about. However, it is worth scrutinizing, as BioWare’s follow-through has been inconsistent.</p><p>Both <em>Mass Effect </em>and <em>Dragon Age</em> have a habit of not necessarily outright contradicting player choice, but certainly writing around it in a way that makes what you did mostly irrelevant. <em>Dragon Age II</em> and<em> Inquisition</em> found ways to bring back party members like Anders and Leliana, even if they were ostensibly killed in <em>Origins</em>. The team explicitly addresses those contradictions (Anders was just presumed dead, Leliana was a ghost), but they were still sore spots for those who made certain decisions in previous games. BioWare has also used an assumed canon in spin-off materials like comics, anime, and novels.</p><p><em>Mass Effect </em>has been less egregious, but BioWare has found ways to write around player choice in the sequels, such as promoting Udina to the human councilor position in <em>ME3</em> even if you didn’t nominate him at the end of the first game, or still finding ways to include Rachni enemies in <em>ME3</em> even if you seemingly killed off the race of space bugs two games prior. Ultimately, I appreciate BioWare making this philosophy clear, I just hope it actually follows through when <em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</em> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-release-date-rook-party-trailer-1851622692&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-release-date-rook-party-trailer-1851622692">launches on October 31</a></span>, and I especially hope it extends beyond <em>Dragon Age </em>when the next <em>Mass Effect </em>game comes out <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/mass-effect-4-5-bioware-teaser-release-date-2029-1851009417&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/mass-effect-4-5-bioware-teaser-release-date-2029-1851009417">sometime in the distant future</a></span>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Motion Twin, the creators of the popular Dead Cells, has released over 15 minutes of gameplay <a href="https://windblown.game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">for its new game</a> Windblown.</p>



<p>“Join us for the first 15 minutes of Single Player gameplay in Windblown,” the studio says in the description. “In this short (ish) video, we’ll take you through the basics, as you’ll experience what it’s like to step into the shoes of a Leaper for the very first time. </p>



<p>“We won’t spoil too much though, as you’ll need to dive into Windblown yourself later this year to see how fast you can really go!”</p>

<p>First revealed at The Game Awards 2023, Windblown is an action roguelike centered around fast-pace movement on combat. According to Motion Twin, the game will feature unique weapons and abilities as well as combat that is “tough but always fair.”</p>

<p>Windblown launches in PC early access later this year with a full release to come later on. A firm early access release date has yet to be revealed.</p>

                <p>Ever since <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/internet-reacts-to-palworld-and-its-massive-success/1100-6520490/" data-ref-id="1100-6520490">Palworld</a> was released earlier this year, it seemed inevitable that Nintendo would eventually go after the game for its similarities to Pokemon. The Pokemon Company even announced its <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-pokemon-company-says-it-intends-to-investigate-palworld/1100-6520591/" data-ref-id="1100-6520591">intention to investigate Palworld</a> back in January. This week, Nintendo and The Pokemon Company finally went ahead and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-is-suing-palworld-devs/1100-6526569/" data-ref-id="1100-6526569">sued Palworld developer Pocketpair</a> for patent infringement instead of copyright infringement. And according to one analyst, this is a strategy that Nintendo has successfully used against rivals in the past.</p><p>Kantan Games CEO and video game analyst Serkan Toto spoke to <a href="https://www.404media.co/cold-blooded-business-nintendo-is-patent-trolling-palworld-because-it-got-too-big/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">404 Media</a> and noted that Nintendo used the same patent infringement tactics against Japanese mobile game developer Colopl in 2018. That eventually led to a<a href="https://www.pocketgamer.biz/nintendo-settles-five-year-court-battle-with-white-cat-project-developers/?ref=404media.co" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow"> $30 million settlement</a> in Nintendo's favor. Colopl now pays licensing fees to Nintendo to use some specific patents, and Toto believes that Pocketpair may eventually have to make its own deal with Nintendo.</p><p>"I think that the profit margin is probably sky high for Palworld and I think that Nintendo didn't like that one bit and said, 'Look, they're basically stealing our character designs,'" said Toto. "'We cannot do anything about this. So let's screw them with other things, like... patents that are very, very technical. The patents are not listed yet, so we don't know which patents. We don't know which patents Nintendo is actually talking about, but I bet with you already today that it's going to be highly, highly technical things."</p><p>Toto also predicts that Palworld will not be shut down by any future settlement, but he contends that the lawsuit was Nintendo's way of punishing Pocketpair for its success with its Pokemon-adjacent game.</p><p>"I think that Nintendo just saw these guys are getting too aggressive," added Toto. "Nintendo thinks Pocketpair is copying what they are doing, and before they even start distributing the PlayStation version or executing these IP expansion plans, Nintendo is going to spit in their bowl. I don't think that Nintendo looks at these things through an idealistic lens at all. This is just a pure, cold-blooded business."</p><p>Pocketpair recently disclosed that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/palworld-wont-switch-over-to-live-service-model/1100-6526491/" data-ref-id="1100-6526491">it will not switch Palworld to a free-to-play or live-service model</a>.

                <p dir="ltr">We're all tired, but a college athlete probably shouldn't be overly fatigued after a half of a game. That's why EA Sports College Football 25 is addressing the Wear and Tear mechanic in a new title update that's now available. Additionally, the patch adds new nickel plays for defenses as well as fixes a kickoff exploit that benefited the kicking team.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.ea.com/games/ea-sports-college-football/college-football-25/news/college-football-25-campus-huddle-title-update-september-19th-2024?utm_campaign=cf25_hd_ww_ic_soco_twt_cfb25tu4&amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;cid=82085&amp;ts=1726755831264" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The EA Sports College Football 25 website</a> details everything new with the title update, which went live September 19. Saving custom audibles is now in the game, along with the previously mentioned tuning to Wear and Tear. A GameSpot editor noted that they would have to bench their running back in the second half sometimes because the mechanic was so harsh.</p><p dir="ltr">The new defensive plays are for nickel coverages and blitzing from the edges, as well as covering receiver formations where three players are stacked near each other. The update for EA Sports College Football 25 also hopefully ends a kickoff exploit that would ensure the receiving team doesn't catch the ball. A dev note states that this will be monitored going forward, with more changes possibly on the way.</p><p dir="ltr">Last month, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-sports-college-football-25-patch-adds-new-on-field-fits-formations-and-bug-fixes/1100-6525628/" data-ref-id="1100-6525628">a EA Sports College Football 25 patch brought about new offensive shotgun formations</a> and behavioral adjustments to AI opponents.

But a post shared on the official <em>Final Fantasy XVI</em> X account earlier today says it’s been released “in response to the crashes and graphical bugs” reported by players.</p><p>Following the PS5 update released September 12th (24.06-10.00.00), people playing <em>Final Fantasy XVI </em>and some other games, like <em>Star Wars Outlaws, Death Stranding</em>, and <em>Elden Ring</em>, reported stutters and other issues. In<em> Final Fantasy, </em>players reported game crashes while loading save files or fast-traveling. Others experienced severe graphical issues, including <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FFXVI/comments/1fhe841/do_not_play_ff16_on_performance_mode_what_is_this/">black squares that would end up covering</a> large portions of the screen, making the game unplayable. </p><p>At the time, <a href="https://x.com/finalfantasyxvi/status/1835956338180214969">Square Enix said it was working</a> with Sony Interactive Entertainment (SIE) to determine what was causing the bugs and encouraged players to wait for further updates.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

As you’re minding your own business, exploring the stars, and looting leftovers from the various wrecks, you’ll find roaming pirates, faction starfighters, and Imperial cruisers constantly vying for sector control. You can’t avoid a dogfight. But you can end it early by learning to become an ace pilot.<br></p><p>You’ll primarily take the offensive with your Laser Cannons, which have a significantly shorter cooldown than your backup Missile Launcher. Thankfully, Laser Cannons automatically lock on to nearby enemies, giving you a clear target that tells you how far to lead your shots to land a hit. But Laser Cannons take time to cut down targets.<br></p><p>Your Missile Launcher makes quick work of nimble starfighters, but only if you land your shot. You can designate a target by hitting ‘A’ (Xbox) or ‘Y’ (PlayStation) on your controller to prep the missile, then the same button again to launch the ordinance. So long as you’ve locked on, the rocket will pursue your foe until it either explodes or fails to strike the target.<br></p><p>Don’t let up, though!

But you won’t unlock your hyperdrive until you progress deeper into the game’s main story. For that, you must finish “The Wreck,” the seventh story mission.</p><p>Once you unlock the hyperdrive and it’s installed in the Trailblazer, take off from Toshara. Once in orbit, press right on your controller’s D-Pad to activate the hyperdrive. You’ll receive a list of the in-game planets available to jump to, and you can select any of them to visit next. Once chosen, press both analog sticks up to initiate the jump and soar through space and time to the next system!

                <p>A new report has revealed the jaw-dropping sum of money that Microsoft reportedly spends each year to encourage third-party developers and publishers to bring their games to Xbox Game Pass.</p><p><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2024-09-20/xbox-president-sarah-bond-predicts-the-future-of-microsoft-s-next-game-console?embedded-checkout=true" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Bloomberg reported</a> that, "Microsoft now spends $1 billion a year getting third-party games on the subscription service." The site said Microsoft offers "flat fees of millions of dollars upfront" to add titles from smaller publishers to Game Pass.</p><p>GameSpot has contacted Microsoft in an effort to get more details on this. Presumably Microsoft would pay more for a developer to bring a new release to Game Pass at launch compared to a licensing arrangement for an older title. </p><p dir="ltr">In 2021, Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer spoken openly about how there is no one defined path for the deals it makes for Game Pass releases. He told <a href="https://www.theverge.com/21611412/microsoft-phil-spencer-interview-xbox-series-x-launch-decoder-podcast" rel="nofollow ">The Verge</a> that Microsoft's Game Pass deals are "all over the place," and he understands that this might sound "unmanaged."</p><p dir="ltr">In some cases, Microsoft will completely fund the development costs of a game, and the studio can go sell their game on rival stores like PlayStation and Steam, or at retail, while Microsoft enjoys the benefit of having another Game Pass game. "For them, they've protected themselves from any downside risk. The game is going to get made. Then they have all the retail upside, we have the opportunity for day and date. That would be a flat fee payment to a developer," he said.</p><p dir="ltr">In other cases, a game might be finished, and then Microsoft works out a straight cash deal to bring it to Game Pass, Spencer said. Still, other deals involve usage and how much monetization a game has through in-game sales. If this all sounds like the Wild West, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-game-pass-is-a-new-paradigm/1100-6498307/" data-ref-id="1100-6498307">it's because it is.</a></p><p dir="ltr">Spencer has been frank in acknowledging Microsoft doesn't have all the answers. "We're open [to] experimenting with many different partners, because we don't think we have it figured out. When we started, we had a model that was all based on usage. Most of the partners said, 'Yeah, yeah, we understand that, but we don't believe it, so just give us the money upfront,'" he said.</p><p>While Microsoft can pay smaller publishers big money to bring their titles to Game Pass, larger publishers don't always take the money or agree to put their titles on Game Pass, for any number of reasons. Strauss Zelnick, the head of GTA and Red Dead company Take-Two, told Bloomberg that putting its big games on Game Pass at launch doesn't make "any sense at all."</p><p>Zelnick has been <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/take-two-boss-says-call-of-duty-on-game-pass-will-help-drive-memberships-for-a-period-of-time/1100-6525664/" data-ref-id="1100-6525664">saying this for a long time</a>. Take-Two has, however, brought some of its older titles to Game Pass, including Grand Theft Auto V and Red Dead Redemption II, though both have since rotated out of the catalog. Recently, Zelnick discussed Microsoft's decision to put Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 on Game Pass at launch, saying it <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/take-two-boss-says-call-of-duty-on-game-pass-will-help-drive-memberships-for-a-period-of-time/1100-6525664/" data-ref-id="1100-6525664">will help drive Game Pass memberships, but only for a period of time.</a></p><p>Many have questioned the economic sustainability of launching brand-new games on Game Pass, and that's one of the reasons <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sony-defends-ps-plus-price-hike-explains-why-it-wont-put-games-there-day-one/1100-6518715/" data-ref-id="1100-6518715">why Sony doesn't launch new PlayStation games into PlayStation Plus.</a></p><p>In other Game Pass news, a new Standard tier of the service just launched, though it has some key differences between the other versions. For more, check out <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-game-pass-price-games-tiers/1100-6524825/" data-ref-id="1100-6524825">GameSpot's breakdown of all the Game Pass tiers. </a></p>

            <p>Motion Twin has gifted us a 15-minute peek at the follow-up to its hugely acclaimed action-platformer <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dead-cells">Dead Cells</a>, Windblown.</p>
<p>The uncut segment takes us through the basics and offers a mostly spoiler-free insight into "what it's like to step into the shoes of a Leaper for the very first time".</p>
<p>To save you looking, here's the full fifteen-minute treat below:</p>

<p>"In Windblown, players will leap with speed through vast, ever-changing islands in the sky as they use a variety of powerful weapons to destroy the Sentinels – deadly minions of the Vortex that threaten their home," Motion Twin teases.</p>
<p>"Movement is simple yet precise, with dashes launching the player between floating islands and platforms, evading deadly Sentinel assaults, and advancing towards the player’s next inevitable encounter. From the first leap into the Autumn biome and beyond, players will overcome countless adversaries whilst picking up different Weapons, Trinkets, Gifts and Fish to help unleash their Leaper’s full potential."</p>
<p>Whilst we still don't yet have a firm release date, the end of the teaser reveals that Motion Twin still plan to release the game in early access on PC in 2024... and there's only three months left of 2024, of course.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dead-cells-developers-next-game-is-lightning-fast-combat-roguelite-windblown">Motion Twin's Windblown was announced at the end of last year</a>. Described as "tough but always fair", it's a combat-focused adventure - playable either solo or with up to three friends online - that casts participants as Leapers, warriors charged with protecting their home world, The Ark, from the deadly Vortex and its Sentinel minions.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/20/concords-future-still-unknown-as-the-games-director-steps-down/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p><a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/concord">Concord</a>‘s Director, Ryan Ellis, has stepped down following the game’s dire launch last month which ultimately resulted in <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/03/concord-is-shutting-down-this-week-refunds-being-issued-while-they-explore-options/">Sony pulling it from sale</a> and refunding everyone who purchased a copy.</p>
<p>Since being taken offline, there has been no communication as to what comes next for Concord or, more importantly, the staff at <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/firewalk-studios">Firewalk Studios</a> impacted by its failure to sell copies. According to <a href="https://kotaku.com/concord-firewalk-studios-relaunch-ps5-sony-playstation-1851652811">Kotaku</a>, who has spoken to sources within the development team, Ellis (who formerly worked at Bungie as <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/destiny-2">Destiny 2</a>‘s Creative Director) still remains at the company but will now adopt a supporting role.</p>
<p><iframe title="Concord - Launch Trailer I PS5 &amp; PC Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xQB_2FF2G1o?start=2&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>While there are no doubt critical discussions being had in regards to the future of Firewalk and its flagship title, Sony’s radio silence has opened the door to rampant speculation. Having invested millions of dollars and years of development time into creating Concord, it seems unlikely that it would be completely abandoned, especially when you consider how fun the core game is. Despite the circumstances surrounding the game’s launch, it played really well with fun, frenetic first person shooting and interesting character loadouts. In our <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/30/concord-review-a-fun-frenetic-hero-shooter/">Concord review</a> we scored it an 8/10 and were admittedly saddened to see the axe fall so soon, casting doubt over its promising future.</p>
<p>Although it was refreshing to see a multiplayer game eschew the heavily-monetised free-to-play model, it’s evident that fans of the genre weren’t willing to pay a one-time fee of £34.99 for a PvP-only video game. Pulling a U-turn and squeezing Concord into that F2P mould now seems like the most likely course of action though it won’t happen overnight. Firewalk would potentially need to consider which elements to lock behind a paywall, how to implement earned and premium in-game currencies, and whether future content should be rolled out in a monetised season pass.</p>

<p>Giving the game away to <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/playstation-plus">PlayStation Plus</a> subscribers isn’t completely off the table, though it would leave a question mark over Concord’s PC version. Seeing how poorly it performed on Steam, would Sony abandon the platform completely to focus on its core PlayStation audience?</p>
<p>There’s also the possibility that Concord may never return and that Firewalk will now support other PlayStation Studios. Finally, there’s a grim chance of major layoffs and a scenario in which the developer is shut down entirely, given the tumultuous industry landscape right now.</p>
<p>We’re still hoping for the former outcome. There’s a great game in Concord and one that could reach the audience it deserves if smartly repackaged and relaunched at the right time.</p>

But there’s a bit of a twist, as there are actually three release dates to look out for.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197260" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Agatha All Along Star Sasheer Zamata On Witchcraft And Star Trek" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="348" data-playlist="197260,197209,196923" data-current="197260"><div><p>Agatha All Along Star Sasheer Zamata On Witchcraft And Star Trek</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197260/197260_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197260/197260_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197260/197260_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197260/197260_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/22805.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>As announced through the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/arcaneshow/status/1836941948042555820&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/arcaneshow/status/1836941948042555820" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">show’s X</a></span> (formerly Twitter) account on September 19, the final season of <em>Arcane </em>will be airing on Netflix in three acts. The first act will be released on November 9, only a couple of days after the three-year anniversary of the show’s first season dropping on Netflix. The second act will follow a week later, on November 16, and the third a week after that on November 23. This release schedule follows the example of the first season which had three episodes in each act, and while we still don’t know exactly how many episodes each act of season two contains, it’s likely it will be the same.</p><p>Netflix does seem to love its staggered releases lately. Just this year, <em>Bridgerton </em>and <em>Emily in Paris </em>both divided their most recent seasons into <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2024/09/03/netflixs-split-in-half-shows-are-now-less-relevant-than-ever/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2024/09/03/netflixs-split-in-half-shows-are-now-less-relevant-than-ever/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">two-part events</a></span> that aimed to boost viewership and keep subscribers around. The streaming era has also caused a lot of debate about whether a week-to-week release schedule or dropping a show all at once is better. I think there are benefits to both, depending on the show, but as someone who has been waiting for three years to see how <em>Arcane </em>concludes, I have to say I just want it all right now.</p><p>In addition to dropping the release dates, Netflix did tease fans a bit more with a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/netflix/status/1836933796890890548&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/netflix/status/1836933796890890548" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">new clip</a></span>. This footage shows an in-depth look at the pit-fighter Vi we’ve seen hints of in trailers. After the events of season one, in which her relationships with both her sister and her newfound ally Caitlyn falter by show’s end, Vi is not in a good place. She’s drinking, getting the shit beat out of her, seeing visions of Caitlyn and her dead friends, all while we get to see Jinx look on in the crowd. It sets up the finale to be a pretty dark conclusion to the story of Vi, Caitlyn, and Jinx, and I couldn’t be more excited.</p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

That's a valid answer! Games with moral choices like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Baldur's Gate 3</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> give players the freedom to be good or evil because those are valid choices in the context of each adventure. Games are about acquiring power, and what is a villain if not one who lusts for power above everything else?</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">But 11-Bit studios has won praise time and time again for thinking about cruelty in a different way. In </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>This War of Mine</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Frostpunk</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, it explored the dark choices people make in times of crisis. </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Frostpunk 2</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> carries forward that tradition, bringing players back to the frozen city of New London after it survived the events of the first game.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Now those choices come in a different context. In </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Frostpunk</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, players struggled to survive a blizzard consuming the entire planet. In </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Frostpunk 2</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, players must now decide what society will look like on this new snowy earth. Multiple factions (some moderate, some fanatical) lobby the player on different paths for the future. Each one contains the potential for immense harm.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It's 11-Bit's hope that players don't become desensitized to these choices—or that if they do, it helps them reflect on how people in power become so cold. The studio was determined—as Game director Jakub Stokalski put it—to not make the game a "jackass simulator."</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a data-discover="true" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/preserving-the-past-with-charles-cecil-game-developer-podcast-ep-46" target="_self">Preserving the Past With Charles Cecil: Game Developer Podcast Ep. 46</a></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Frostpunk 2"><span>Frostpunk 2</span>'s Zeitgeist system measures moral values to force choices on the player</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Stokalski is himself something of a fanatic—a fanatic for meaningful game design, that is. He's given </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://gdcvault.com/play/1029351/The-Language-of-Gameplay-and">talks at events like Game Developers Conference</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> about how developers should be taking advantage of what he calls a "new language" to explore ambitious ideas. "We have a unique opportunity to build playgrounds for players...but also to explore experience with more nuanced [values]," he said, gesticulating for emphasis. The power he said, is how developers can build values into game mechanics.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Frostpunk</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, those mechanics are embodied in what 11-Bit Studios calls "the zeitgeist system." It's a system that interacts with the core survival mechanics of the game, which include faction sentiment, tension, heating needs, health, cleanliness, food supply, and crime. Keeping all of those elements in balance while exploring the Frostland is the basic element of the game.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">While variables like temperature drops and population growth can drive those numbers, the zeitgeist system upends players by forcing them to bounce the different faction's needs off each other. Each faction is given different values. The Evolvers want society to adapt to the new frozen world, while the Faithkeepers "seek ascension through technology," and want to build a "perfect" mega city in New London.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a data-discover="true" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/group-photo-the-editors-of-game-developer-discuss-their-favorite-game-photos" target="_self">Group photo: The editors of Game Developer discuss their favorite photo modes</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The Evolvers frown on laws and tech tree updates that ease life in the city at the expense of expansion, and the Faithkeepers despise expansionary improvements. They express their approval or disapproval after the player completes certain quests, passes laws, or researches advancements in the tech tree.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The "council" system is one Stokalski said 11-Bit is particularly proud of. It's a space for the conflicting values to directly clash, and push the player to wheel and deal for different votes, which keep the push-and-pull of managing New London moving along. "You end up basically [making] a parliament—which I hate by the way," he joked. "We are really making an effort to frame all of our political stuff in a way that is speaking to the core of what politics are, which is negotiating a common future, rather than the technicalities of [real-world] parliaments."</span></p><p>Image via 11-Bit Studios.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">There are two fun design advantages the system offers. First, it opens the door for players to undo laws, something they couldn't do in the first </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Frostpunk</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. If they committed to an oppressive decision, there was no turning back for them. Factions demanding players revisit laws drive the upgrades that shape the state of the city are constantly upended.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a data-discover="true" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/how-petals-preludes-texas-chainsaw-massacre-with-a-simple-photo-mode" target="_self">How Petals preludes Texas Chainsaw Massacre with a simple photo mode</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The second has to do with the vote count itself. Most policies start with a mix of voters opposed to a law and in support of it, with the remainder "uncertain." Players can secure votes from factions by making promises, or just let it ride and see where the votes land. Instead of just spitting out a result, 11-Bit created a display that shows the votes being tallied up—creating visual tension as players wait to see if a vote succeeds or fails. It has the same energy as watching a dice roll in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Baldur's Gate 3</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Just like real-world politics, there's a bit of exhilaration in watching the fate of society be decided before you.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="How do you build your own Zeitgeist system?">How do you build your own Zeitgeist system?</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Experiencing </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Frostpunk 2</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">'s Zeitgeist system is a thrill. One can see the hard work 11-Bit put in to keep the state of New London in constant tension. Even when things are going well and everyone is in harmony, there's a sense that any second </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>something</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> will go wrong and the player be back at the table, scrambling to secure votes, or weighing whether they can afford to crush a protest.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It also sounds like it was hard as hell to make. </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Frostpunk 2</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> has been in development since 2020 (not counting early prototyping in 2019). 11-Bit switched among three game engines during the process. And because of how the studio operates, each early prototype and vertical slice needed a great deal more polish than what other games usually target, in order to express the "mood" the team is going for.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Even after the game direction and tools were set, the Zeitgeist system needed constant testing, as every new feature added complexity that upended existing work. Stokalski explained that 11-Bit did not hard-code certain kinds of decisions in for the factions, wanting every reaction and demand to be as emergent as possible. "It's about making sure whatever is driving the variability in your system is actually built into the system itself, rather than trying to play whack-a-mole with all the different problems that can happen," he said.</span></p><p>Image via 11-Bit Studios.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">If the team ever wanted a faction to react a specific way to a decision, a custom quest would be created that would make clear to the player this was a hard negotiating point.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Making the system fun and coherent also sometimes showed the limits of Stokalski's passion for the "new language" of game design. Making the Zeitgeist system meant sacrificing many of the organic oddities that can spring out of relationships between ideological factions in the real world. The game doesn't express how the strange rules of legislative bodies like the American </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.npr.org/2022/01/17/1072714887/filibuster-explained">filibuster</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> can shape the process for what kinds of laws can be passed.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It also can't fully capture the intentional hypocrisy of a "law and order" party </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/07/13/politics/trump-fbi-wray-analysis/index.html">turning on law enforcement agencies</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> when they are investigating its constituents and preferred candidate.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">But that's the cost of making sure a game like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Frostpunk 2</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> is compelling, and not just a half-hearted attempt to simulate reality.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Cruelty in ">Cruelty in <span>Frostpunk 2</span> is not the point</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Stokalski neatly broke down why enabling player cruelty is such a useful tool in game design: cruelty often represents player freedom, while pursuing the moral high ground sometimes means turning away from features or content in a game. "You only do evil stuff if you're doing it for fun," he observed.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">He doesn't mind those systems (they're just not the ones he wants to make), but he said if a game wants to explore morality, it would benefit from remembering "no one wants to be an evil person."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"You don't set out to do evil things because you want to be evil, you set out to do these things because you are driven by a certain set of values," he said. "The trick is these values are not the same for everyone."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">So in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Frostpunk 2</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, doing evil deeds like starving a population, enabling torture, or condemning a faction to death are meant to emerge from whatever values are driving the player's strategy of managing society.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">That would be the major difference from making it—as Stokalski called it—a "jackass simulator."</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Senior Editor, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Bryant Francis is a writer, journalist, and narrative designer based in Boston, MA.
