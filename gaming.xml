            <p>Aside from being a game where you run around a shopping mall murdering the living dead, the original Dead Rising from 2006 is a clownish satire of sleazy tabloid photojournalism. It expresses this by way of its scoring system, where you earn "Prestige points" for snapping pictures that fit one of five categories: "Brutal" scenes of characters being slain; moments of "Horror", such as the spectacle of an approaching horde; comical "Outtakes", like characters caught in bizarre poses; moments of "Drama", such as people reacting to discoveries; and "Erotic" photos of women alive or undead, which range from snaps of exposed underwear to close-ups of cleavage.</p>
<p>The Erotica tag has, however, been chopped from the Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster, in what Capcom gingerly suggest isn't "a response to a changing cultural climate", but expressive of the view that earning points from such photos is not "an appropriate reward for survival and not a skill required of a journalist trying to stay alive".</p><!--more-->
<p>The tag's removal accompanies some necessary tweaks to the game's writing and quests. According to <a href="https://www.vg247.com/capcom-on-erotica-removal-from-dead-rising-remake-not-a-response-to-changing-cultural-climate">VG247</a>, an early-game quest where a rival photographer tasks you with taking a high quality Erotica shot has been exchanged for an Outtake photo request instead.</p>
<p>The Erotica tag's removal was discovered last week by <a href="https://www.famitsu.com/article/202408/13749">Famitsu</a>, but Capcom have only just shared an official statement. "When developing Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster, we tried our best to create a game that would please returning core fans and appeal to new players alike," it reads. "As development progressed, we inevitably discovered that we couldn't include everything from the original game. In the case of the Erotica points system, this was something we discussed at length and decided to remove; not so much as a response to a changing cultural climate, but because we felt there is no need to have a reward points system on this basis.</p>
<p>"Additionally, when considering Frank's situation, it is not an appropriate reward for survival and not a skill required of a journalist trying to stay alive for the next 72 hours during a zombie apocalypse," it continues. "However, players will still have the right to choose their picture subjects freely, and even though they won't receive points, it is up to them to decide what photos they will take to represent their journey."</p>
<p>Gosh, there's a lot of very careful talking-around-the-subject going on in that statement. The unspoken gist, I think, is "we don't want to have a mechanism in our game that actively rewards sexual harassment, but also, we don't want to upset the people who get mad when they can't see <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/badwomensanatomy/comments/a79q9v/vagina_bones/">"vagina bones"</a>, so please remember that you can still take pictures of women's bodies - you just won't get any points for them". </p>
<p>The removal of Erotica tags from the game has attracted a mixture of responses - and in fairness, not all of them are the predictable diatribes about evil femiwotsits doing censorship. Some people point out that removing the tag spoils the satire: Frank is supposed to be a lecherous and amoral piece of work, and the whole game is a send-up of the male gaze. Others argue more straightforwardly that getting rid of the system is contrary to the idea of game preservation embodied by a remaster.</p>
<p>I can sympathise a bit with these last two arguments, but I have some counterpoints: firstly, Dead Rising's satire is very often indistinguishable from giggling schoolboy wish fulfilment. Unlike with, say, player footage of butts in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-crush-house-review-sassiety-of-the-spectacle">The Crush House</a>, the game never says anything complex or interesting about Frank's professional sexism. It's just cheap punchdown humour, gleefully modelling the fact that women are <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/media/60f03e068fa8f50c77458285/2021-07-12_Sexual_Harassment_Report_FINAL.pdf">far more likely than men to face sexual harassment</a>. </p>
<p>Playing the game as a youngster, I don't remember feeling enlightened about the workings of tabloid reporting - I just felt like the game was exhorting me to be a creep. As for the argument about preservation, the original version of Dead Rising is <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/427190/DEAD_RISING/">still available</a>, so if you want some Prestige in return for your snapshots of zomboobies, you can always buy that one instead.</p>
<p>It's been at least a decade since I played the original Dead Rising, and it's possible I'm skimming something important. Here's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dead-rising-deluxe-remasters-survivors-are-still-idiots-but-at-least-they-can-die-horribly-in-style-now">Nic's better-informed take</a> on the Erotica tag's junking, after a few hours with the new version. "It was entirely gendered and entirely vacuous, and the Remaster is better for its absence," he wrote. "There might be an argument to be made for preservation, but the 2016 version will continue to exist, so this is the next best option if they're not going to democratise the process and let players amass an album of artful schlong shots."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>If you’ve been hoping to see the next Nintendo Switch release in early 2025, you might be disappointed. According to new claims, the Nintendo Switch 2 won’t be launching this fiscal year 2025.</p>



<p>On the latest episode of the <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/krafton-saves-tango-gameworks-and-numbers-all-of-the-numbers-gi-microcast" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GI Microcas</a>t, GameIndustry.biz’s head of games Christopher Dring gave an update on what he’s been told about the next Nintendo console.</p>







<p>“No developer I’ve spoken to expects it to launch in this financial year, in fact they’ve been told not to expect it in this financial year,” Dring said. “A bunch of people I spoke to hope it’s out in April/May time still early next year not late…”</p>



<p>Despite no launch during the fiscal year, an official reveal of the console is still expected during that time frame.</p>



<p>For clarification, Nintendo’s fiscal year runs from April 1 – March 31. Currently, the company is in Q2 of fiscal year 2025 after <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/en/events/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">reporting its Q1 earnings</a> earlier this month. </p>



<p>Nintendo has declined to comment on the latest rumors. </p>

We agree, it was! We listened and added more lighting effects to give every scene the clarity it deserves to show off the gorgeous art…</li><li><strong>User Interface</strong> – In our last update we shared a newer version of the user interface, but we weren’t done iterating. We did extensive research to determine the best user interface for the game because you’ll be able to control and transform several characters, so the user interface needed to work for each one. During this time, we also took our time to revamp the entire menu system as well as the game’s HUD. Please note that this may not be final, but it’s much closer to what we would like! Please, have a look on our Steam page where all the 4K screenshots have been updated to reflect more examples of the new user interface and all other mentioned effects. We’re really proud of what we achieved.</li><li><strong>Cutscene Reworks</strong> – We are spending more time to rework every animation frame from every cutscene (and there are quite many, trust us!) to align the work of our wonderful 2D artists and present a cohesive art style for the project.</li><li><strong>Gameplay Reworks</strong> – We’ve reworked much of the gameplay to give you a tense feeling while playing. We want your senses heightened like they would with any great horror game or movie. Whether that’s when you are holding Lana’s breath, hiding or battling it out with Mr. Kyn and other enemies that you may encountered during your journey…</li></ul></blockquote><!-- AD: content -->

      </div>
<p>You build out your own case board, red strings and all, and the game is happy to let you make the wrong assumptions. You can play stealthily, sneaking into businesses after hours to rummage through their trash, or take on the role of a confrontational gumshoe who harasses passersby in the streets. You can hack computers, check call histories, bribe people for information, and more. The game gives you an impressive amount of freedom, outdoing many of its genre counterparts in ambition.</p><p>You can read my <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/this-detective-sim-is-making-its-case-as-one-of-the-years-coolest-surprises/1100-6513706/" data-ref-id="1100-6513706">preview from last year</a> for more of my impressions. I haven't been back to the game in a while, but I suspect it's only gotten better. The digital version can now be preordered on consoles, while the PC version remains available in Early Access for a few more weeks.</p>

            <link>https://aftermath.site/valve-deadlock-verge</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/valve%E2%80%99s-baffling-deadlock-decisions-don%E2%80%99t-need-defending.952185/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/valve-deadlock-verge<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Valve has a new game in the works, <em>Deadlock</em>, even though it also <em>doesn’t</em> have a new game in the works at all. <em>Deadlock </em>is an unannounced hero shooter that <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/fps/we-can-all-see-that-valves-unannounced-shooter-deadlock-just-hit-over-18000-concurrent-players-gabe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">tens of thousands of people</a> were playing over the weekend, including streamers and journalists who have just been asked to… please not talk about it?</p><p>Yesterday, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/12/24219016/valve-deadlock-hands-on-secret-new-game" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Verge</a> wrote up their impressions of <em>Deadlock</em>, which reporter Sean Hollister “received a no-strings-attached invite” for. According to Hollister, the game features a pop-up reminding players that it’s still in development, and saying “Do not share anything about the game with anyone.” Hollister wrote that this message popped up on launch, but that he "didn’t click ‘OK’; instead, I hit the Escape key and watched it disappear.”</p><p>“I’m not under NDA. I have signed no contracts and made no verbal agreements,” Hollister wrote. “I haven’t even clicked through a EULA.”</p><p>As we’ve <a href="https://aftermath.site/games-journalism-an-faq" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">written before</a>, companies will often attach caveats to game access they provide journalists, which can be an embargo (agreeing not to publish something until a certain time) or a non-disclosure agreement, or NDA (a legally-binding contract about what a journalist can or cannot say). A dismissable pop-up is neither of those things; Hollister didn’t agree to any special rules in exchange for <em>Deadlock</em> access, or break any agreements by writing it up, and he apparently wasn’t even required to agree to Valve’s ask, though this seems to me like a technical oversight rather than an intended option.</p><p>This hasn’t stopped some people from being very mad at The Verge, with Verge commenters calling Hollister “a bad journalist,” saying it’s a “scummy thing to blog about,” and that the post “kinda goes against the spirit of gaming industry ethics.” Comments under <a href="https://x.com/tomwarren/status/1823279772522197439" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Verge staffers</a>’ tweets are equally outraged, citing unprofessionalism and calling it “karma” that Hollister was banned from multiplayer, even though he wrote that “the current build lets anyone with a copy invite as many Steam friends as they’d like to give it a try, too.”&nbsp;</p><p>Was The Verge publishing this story a <em>nice</em> thing to do? Not really: Valve asked people with <em>Deadlock </em>access not to share about it, and it’s not very nice to ignore requests someone makes of you. But while no good journalist sets out to intentionally hurt someone, the profession requires honesty and fairness over niceness. This can be complicated, and all journalists <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20160830060356/https://gawker.com/how-guilty-should-i-feel-1785565192" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">struggle with it</a>. The news value of The Verge’s story is clear–Valve has been bizarrely secretive about <em>Deadlock</em>, a game <em>thousands of people are currently playing</em>. Readers are right to want to know more about it, and what it’s like to play, and Hollister can tell them that while still adhering to journalistic ethics: he didn’t get access illicitly, or misrepresent himself, or break any agreements.&nbsp;</p><p>This isn’t even a situation specific to journalism; Hollister was not granted special access to the game because of his profession, and there is nothing to stop any player from doing what he did. In fact, plenty of other people have; I can find YouTube videos and Twitch streams of the game easily. Valve could crack down on these by, I imagine, removing these people’s access to <em>Deadlock</em>, or potentially taking other action if they clicked the “OK” button Hollister was able to ignore. The Verge could face bigger consequences; Valve could <a href="https://kotaku.com/a-price-of-games-journalism-1743526293" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">blacklist</a> the outlet, and while I would consider that petty–especially since the company’s tech permitted Hollister to dismiss the agreement–Valve is under no obligation to give The Verge access to its games or reply to the outlet’s questions, the same way The Verge is under no obligation to do what Valve wants regarding its game if there wasn’t a formal agreement.</p><p>There are broader questions here about the relationships between game companies and journalists, something that’s become more and more a topic of conversation since December’s <a href="https://aftermath.site/the-insomniac-hack-reveals-the-ugly-truth-of-video-game-hype" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insomniac hack</a>. Impressions from a news outlet, especially one with the reputation of The Verge, have the power to <a href="https://aftermath.site/the-suicide-squad-situation" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shape public perception</a> of <em>Deadlock</em>. The Verge’s article surely goes against whatever Valve’s completely baffling marketing plan for <em>Deadlock</em> is, but, again, over 16,000 people are playing this game right now and forming opinions of it. Hollister’s responsibility is to inform readers, and he’s done that, even if it wasn’t in the way Valve might have wanted.&nbsp;</p><p>While I wouldn’t fault anyone at Valve for being a bit pissed at this situation, I’d call this journalism functioning as intended: honestly obtaining true information that matters to readers. The lines between games journalists and publishers are already <a href="https://aftermath.site/games-journalism-game-development-ign-kotaku" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fuzzy</a>, in a way that serves companies more than readers. It benefits all of us to shake that up.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Trying to build a gaming PC, but need a CPU that is affordable, yet still will give you the gaming results you want? Luckily, there are definitely some affordable CPUs out there. Here is the best budget CPU for gaming.</p>



<h2 id="h-best-low-price-cpu-for-gaming">Best Low-Price CPU For Gaming</h2>



<p>While quite a few processors are out there for purchase, many are either extremely powerful (and extremely pricey) or not good enough to run multiple different video games. </p>



<p>So, the best budget processor out there for gaming is one that is not only powerful but also provided at a decent price.</p>



<p>Do take note, that the tech world is always changing, and prices may fluctuate.</p>



<h3 id="h-best-budget-gaming-cpu-intel-core-i7-12700kf">Best Budget Gaming CPU: Intel Core i7-12700KF</h3>



<p>The Intel Core i7-12700KF is on the more powerful side of processors, with 12 cores, meaning this CPU will cover pretty much any game you want to play. The more cores, the better. It also comes at a decent price, too.</p>



<h3 id="h-intel-core-i7-12700kf-price-209-99-usd">Intel Core i7-12700KF Price: $209.99 USD</h3>



<p>The processor can be purchased on <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Intel-i7-12700KF-Desktop-Processor-Unlocked/dp/B09FXKHN7M/ref=sr_1_7_mod_primary_new?c=ts&amp;dib=eyJ2IjoiMSJ9.G1RdzZN5remCoPMvWScRuyhm10q5UBybK-hPAsTwr0fL5p_EgR-oRyvLWyKEfUjUeoiw8FW5YoLvvBnR4I4VP0V24bNAFdoyN0eBxL1wrepY-V8-esQxkIgguTYOuZyF-tq21123RGle-_moa7I6_JAteeJXLhOdQgSHnuuELsnp_lDGbzBGauRQKyi10gc_inQHUE7SDuxSFejlNombbYTobol7PYLqw-MrltE-Jt6u2o4msrm1EJYaL0iXRo40LFesCW2SD4F21o6gGKw-NObzwYoDApxqyQ8vjjovCAg.OeEzcY44H0ogg-flykGSgD9QBfuoKjTY0m4TjZM8Jmc&amp;dib_tag=se&amp;keywords=Computer%2BCPU%2BProcessors&amp;qid=1722895850&amp;refinements=p_n_feature_four_browse-bin%3A2289792011&amp;s=pc&amp;sbo=RZvfv%2F%2FHxDF%2BO5021pAnSA%3D%3D&amp;sr=1-7&amp;ts_id=229189&amp;th=1">Amazon</a> or other sites. You could also find a used version of the chip on eBay if you wanted to go any cheaper. Either way, the Intel Core i7-12700KF is the budget CPU for you.</p>







<h3 id="h-low-price-processors">Low Price Processors</h3>



<p>While the Intel Core i7-12700KF is the CPU listed in this article as the best low-price processor, there are still many other great processors out there that will get you the results you need. Here is a list:</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/dead-rising-deluxe-remasters-classic-controls-option-confirmed<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>If you are looking forward to playing Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster but wish to use the original control mechanics, you're in luck. The upcoming remaster includes a feature that lets players choose whether to use the control layout from the original game. </p><p>In the settings for Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster, players will have two options: "Standard" and "Classic," as shown in the image below. The former is the new control scheme, which includes quality-of-life improvements to Dead Rising's gameplay, such as the ability to move while aiming. The latter is a control scheme similar to the one used in <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/dead-rising">Dead Rising's original Xbox 360 version</a> and the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2016/08/09/dead-rising-re-releases-get-launch-date-and-price">2016 HD re-release</a>. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/08/12/screenshot-721-1723485419285.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>The two control schemes to choose from in Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster. | Screenshot Credit: Taylor Lyles / IGN</figcaption></figure></output><p>Of course, switching to the Classic Controls comes with its drawbacks. Most notably, you cannot move while aiming (just as it was in the original game). Additionally, the classic control scheme will not allow players to tweak the button assignments as the Standard control type offers. </p><p>This is not the first time Capcom has decided to keep a smidge of the original Dead Rising in the game beyond keeping the story intact. Last month, Capcom confirmed that players who pre-order either the Standard or Deluxe version of Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster will obtain a costume that lets players use the classic Frank West skin from the original game. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>I recently had the opportunity to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dead-rising-deluxe-remaster-preview">play an early build of Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster</a> hands-on. While I enjoyed the game, including the new control scheme, I did find myself at times pressing the button from the old controls when doing specific actions such as picking up an item or switching up which item I have in my inventory to equip. </p><p>Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster will be released on September 19 for digital storefronts, while the physical copy will be released on November 8.</p><p><em>Taylor is a Reporter at IGN.

                <p>The team behind Knockout City is going in a very different direction for its next game. Velan Studios recently revealed <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/midnight-murder-club/" data-ref-id="5000-633798">Midnight Murder Club</a>, a PvP shooter set (mostly) in a pitch-black mansion. Players use their flashlights to creep around the ornate halls, defeat other players, and sometimes even steal valuables before each round ends. And soon, you can do this yourself with an upcoming playtest.</p><p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2698870/Midnight_Murder_Club/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Over on its Steam page, you can now request access for future playtests</a>, and GameSpot is told a closed beta is coming on August 22 that will run until August 26. If, like me, you never really wanted to stop playing hide-and-seek and adulthood just sort of forced that upon you, Midnight Murder Club may be one to watch</p>

      </div>
<p>I recently joined the game's alpha test and had a great time. Though the game is clearly unlike Knockout City in most ways, it retains one key ingredient in how funny it can be, often as a result of the community itself creating silly moments.

<p>Sony and <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/08/13/concord-launch-and-the-adventure-ahead/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Firewalk Studios have revealed</a> the post-launch roadmap for the upcoming team-based shooter Concord. </p>



<p>When the game releases, Concord will feature six game modes, 12 maps, and 16 Freegunners. After the game’s launch, however, even more will be added for players. The first season of Concord begins in October, and will include a new Freegunner, a new map, new variants, and various quality of life updates.</p>



<p>The second season begins in January and will also see a new Freegunner and Map added. There will also be a new game mode for all players. Though no details were revealed, Season 3 for Concord is scheduled for April based on the roadmap image below.</p>



<p>The game, as <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/concord-wont-have-a-battle-pass-and-will-add-new-characters-and-maps-for-free/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">previously reported</a>, won’t have a battle pass system for players. Instead, Firewalk Studios will launch an in-game store for players.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>“With season 1, we’ll also be introducing an in-game store for those looking to personalize their Freegunners further with additional customization items and to continue to support the game,” game director Ryan Ellis said. “These will supplement the hundreds of rewards earnable through progression and will be solely cosmetic, optional, and have no gameplay impact.”</p>



<p>Concord launches on August 23 for PlayStation and PC. Those who purchased the Digital Deluxe Edition of the game can start playing on Tuesday, August 20.</p>

<p>Rockstar Games fans who don't traffic in game consoles have <a href="https://www.timeanddate.com/date/durationresult.html?m1=05&amp;d1=18&amp;y1=2010&amp;m2=8&amp;d2=13&amp;y2=2024">been waiting over 5,200 days</a> to play the original <em>Red Dead Redemption</em> on PC (even as the PC port of its sequel <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/11/red-dead-redemption-2-launches-on-pc-we-take-a-mosey-through-its-upgrades/">approaches its fifth anniversary</a>). PC gamers' long wait for a port may soon be over, though, as some promotional copy for the PC version of the game has been briefly leaked online.</p>
<p>The suggestive verbiage comes from the PlayStation Store of all places, which as of Tuesday morning described <em>Red Dead Redemption</em> as "now on PC for the first time ever" on the page for <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/8/7/23811044/red-dead-redemption-remake-rockstar-games-switch-ps4">the game's 2023 PS4 rerelease</a>. While the language has now been reverted to a more generic description, <a href="https://archive.is/zW0NK">archived copies of the site</a> from just hours ago include some details of what we can expect of the jump from console to PC:</p>
<blockquote><p>Featuring the complete single-player experience of both games [<em>RDR</em> and <em>Undead Nightmare</em>, from previous context], including bonus content from the Game of the Year edition, <em>Red Dead Redemption</em> features all of the 2023 console version upgrades plus PC specific enhancements including support for increased resolutions, multiple displays, and other accessories, plus spatial surround sound.</p>
<p><em>Red Dead Redemption</em> does not feature multiplayer content.</p></blockquote>
<figure><a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/rdrpc.png" data-height="458" data-width="702" alt="The PC port promo copy that appeared on the PlayStation Store page for <em>Red Dead Redemption</em> Tuesday morning."></a><figcaption><p><a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/rdrpc.png" data-height="458" data-width="702">Enlarge</a> <span>/</span> The PC port promo copy that appeared on the PlayStation Store page for <em>Red Dead Redemption</em> Tuesday morning.</p></figcaption></figure>
<p>It's hard to know exactly why a description of a PC port would show up on a Sony store page, but it's easy to picture someone in the PR chain pasting in the wrong platform's promotional copy when updating something on the back end.</p>                                                                        
                                                                                
<p>The PS Store leak comes a few months after data miners <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/red-dead-redemption/pc-release-hint">noticed</a> hints of a <em>Red Dead Redemption</em> PC port on the official Rockstar Games Launcher. JSON data buried in the launcher's file invited players to "journey across the sprawling expanses of the American West and Mexico in Red Dead Redemption, and its zombie-horror companion, Undead Nightmare, now playable on PC."</p>
<p>Rockstar has historically prioritized console releases of its major titles, with PC ports <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/12/pc-players-will-probably-have-to-wait-even-longer-for-grand-theft-auto-vi/">generally appearing a few months to a few years</a> after their console counterparts. <em>Red Dead Redemption 2</em> hit PC 375 days after its 2018 console release, while <em>Grand Theft Auto V</em>'s PC players had to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2015/02/the-long-bouncy-saga-of-pc-grand-theft-auto-v-delays/">wait through numerous delays</a> for a release 574 days after that game hit consoles.
</p><p>Last December's <a href="https://www.take2games.com/ir/news/rockstar-games-announces-grand-theft-auto-vi-coming-2025">announcement</a> of the highly anticipated <em>Grand Theft Auto VI</em> only confirmed that the game is "coming to PlayStation 5 computer entertainment systems and Xbox Series X|S games and entertainment systems in 2025."
</p><p>"The reason why a PC port comes later and not the first thing that comes out is because they want to prioritize what sells," former Rockstar developer Mike York <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6CjSHda9IcY">said in a video</a> following the <em>GTA VI</em> announcement.</p>

            <p>Cyberpunk platformer Replaced will now launch in 2025, developer Sad Cat Studio announced today.</p>
<p>The game - which is described as a 2.5D "retro-futuristic sci-fi platformer" and, as I have said before, looks pretty darn good from what I have seen so far - was scheduled to release this year, having been previously delayed due to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/belarusian-based-sat-cat-studio-delays-upcoming-game-due-to-russias-war-in-ukraine">Russia's invasion of Ukraine</a>.</p>
<p>In a new post shared on social media this afternoon, Sad Cat said this most recent delay into next year was to ensure Replaced met the "high standards we've set for ourselves and to meet the expectations of our fans".</p>

<p>The studio called its previous release date "optimistic", apologising to the Replaced community.</p>
<p>"Developing Replaced is quite a unique challenge, and we're proud to be creating something that special," it wrote, before sharing a link to its <a href="https://discord.com/invite/va93k3ZBXV">Discord server</a> where those interested can stay up to date on the game's progress.</p>
<p>In the meantime, Replaced will be at Gamescom, the annual German gaming convention running next week. For those unable to attend in person, Sad Cat has teased "something special for later this week", so keep your eyes peeled.</p>
<p>"Now back to work," the studio closed. "We want you to love Replaced when it launches, so we have to go the extra mile here!"</p> <div>

<p>If you have read this far but aren't sure what Replaced is, here is the official blurb to whet your appetite: "You play as R.E.A.C.H. - an artificial intelligence trapped in a human body against its own will. Replaced combines cinematic platforming, pixel art and free-flow action combat with a deep, engaging dystopian story set in an alternative 1980’s."</p>
<p>On its launch, Replaced will be available for Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, and PC via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1663850/REPLACED/">Steam</a> and <a href="https://www.epicgames.com/store/p/replaced">Epic Games Store</a>. The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cyberpunk-like-platformer-replaced-launching-on-xbox-game-pass-next-year">developer previously confirmed it will be available on Xbox Game Pass</a>, as well.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>The <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/news/dlss-3-level-zero-extraction-dlss-2-speed-freeks-hunt-showdown/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">latest update</a> for NVIDIA DLSS is out, and compatibility with some new games has been added. The main game added in this update is Warhammer 40,000: Speed Freeks. As of August 6, 2024, this game is now in Early Access. If you've been looking for a chaotic, orc-filled experience with all the makings of an arcade racing game, check out Warhammer 40,000: Speed Freeks on Steam.</p>
<p>The list of games added has contributed to a huge list of over 500 games that now have DLSS, Nvidia Reflex, or other ray-traced effect integration. These games are helping enhance the experience for many PC players across the globe by utilizing GeForce RTX graphic cards.</p>
<p>Warhammer 40,000: Speed Freeks is a free-to-play, chaotic racing game where you play as an orc looking to engage in chaos and cause a raucous. Players can choose between buggies, bikes, trukks and more for their races.</p>
<p>In addition to Warhammer 40,000: Speed Freeks, which now has DLSS integration, Level Zero: Extraction is releasing today with DLSS 3 integration. This is a multiplayer extraction survival horror game developed by Doghowl Games and published by tinyBuild. It features asymmetric horrors and high-stake showdowns against enemies as you fight for survival, playing as a PMC mercenary.</p>
<p>For those getting stuck into Level Zero: Extraction on release day, GeForce RTX users can accelerate frame rates with the DLSS 3 integration and Frame Generation.</p>
<p>The final game to get DLSS integration in this update is Hunt: Showdown 1896. However, users won't be able to access the integration settings until August 15, when the game is receiving a massive overhaul, bringing new graphics, a new engine, and more.</p>
<p>Players will explore new Colorado areas and high mountain peaks deep into the mountain mines. New news and features have been consistently dropping about Hunt: Showdown 1896 in recent days, such as the new <a href="https://wccftech.com/hunt-showdown-1896-introduces-hellborn-in-scorched-earth-event/">Wild Target</a> available, as well as the Pacts that Hunters will be able to take, which can help them and hinder their enemies.</p>
<p>Once the game has been re-released, players can use NVIDIA DLSS Super Resolution to accelerate its performance if they don't get the frame rates and quality they desire.</p>
<p>For those planning on getting stuck into Hunt: Showdown 1896 or want to know more about the changes that are coming, Crytek has released a developer insight video that explains what new and returning players can expect from the game.</p>
<p><iframe title="Developer Insight: Tech Advancements &amp; Backend Improvements | Hunt: Showdown" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hpIimnVGUbw?start=1&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>

The other one we knew even less about, until today, when Boss Team revealed a new retro-inspired platformer based on the classic slasher. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://retrorealmsgame.com/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://retrorealmsgame.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">On August 13, Boss Team Games announced <em>RetroRealms</em></a></span>, which appears to be a horror-themed video game digital arcade that will slowly fill up with new retro-like games based on popular horror franchises. To kick off this new series, Boss Team revealed the previously mentioned <em>Halloween </em>game and a similar title based on <em>Ash Vs. Evil Dead,</em> a TV show that ran on Starz a few years ago. Both games arrive on October 13 for PlayStation, Xbox, Switch, and PC. Folks will be able to buy either separately.</p><p>The games are being developed by Wayforward, a studio renowned for their 2D pixel art adventures. And these new spooky platformers look just as good as the studio’s past work.<br></p><h2 id="h6482"><a id=""></a>What is <em>RetroRealms</em> and how does this all work?</h2><p> According to a press release announcing the games, players will be able to control Michael Myers and other characters from the original <em>Halloween </em>in this side-scrolling action-horror game. Similarly, in the <em>Evil Dead</em> game, players will control hero Ash Williams as well as other characters, too. </p><p> Boss Team says that as you explore the <em>RetroRealms </em>digital arcade—a creepy-looking 3D arcade that acts as a unified launcher for the games—you’ll be able to mix and match characters from one world into another if you own both titles. So Michael Myers can kill Deadites in <em>Evil Dead. </em>Boss Team claims you’ll be able to do this with all future characters and games in <em>RetroRealms</em>. </p><figure id="" data-id="646e69b89b9ce59c2876e21975b811b3" data-recommend-id="image://646e69b89b9ce59c2876e21975b811b3" data-format="jpg" data-width="3600" data-height="2025" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="An image shows Ash as seen in the Evil Dead game.

" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Personally, I’m really into this idea of building out a digital arcade with new, retro-inspired games based on popular slashers and classic horror films. And letting you take a character like Michael and plop him into other worlds sounds awesome. The key, though, will be if these games are good. If they are fun and packed full of classic arcade action, I’m down to buy 100 <em>RetroRealms </em>adventures. If they aren’t much fun though, well, this experiment will be dead on arrival.<br></p><p>  “Everyone at Boss Team Games are huge fans of horror and getting to work with these legendary properties is a dream come true,” said Boss Team Games CEO Steve Harris in a press release. “It has been an amazing experience collaborating with WayForward, and our licensors to create not one, but two, fast-paced 90’s arcade-style games while remaining true to the original <em>Halloween </em>film and <em>Ash vs Evil Dead</em> series.”</p><p>The <em>Halloween </em>and <em>Ash Vs Evil Dead</em> games launch on October 13 for PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, and PC. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <title><![CDATA[Stormgate Early Access Review]]></title>
            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/stormgate-review-early-access</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/stormgate-early-access-review.952065/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/stormgate-review-early-access<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>There's a moment right before the start of a ranked RTS match that’s like nothing else I've felt in games, and even in Early Access, Stormgate delivers it. I see my name. I see my opponent's name. I can feel my own heartbeat, and I take a deep breath. Then I'm looking at a colorful command center and a gaggle of workers, and it's just me and some random stranger fighting it out for glory or ruin. Though it's visibly lower budget than its Blizzard-made predecessors, Stormgate is moving the basecraft formula forward on a design level in some subtle and not-so-subtle ways.</p><p>Unsurprisingly, since it's made by a bunch of former Blizzard RTS devs, Stormgate has the feel and overall rhythm of a classic Blizzard RTS. At its best, it's like home cooking for someone who was raised on Brood War and Warcraft 3. I order around my scrappy human Vanguard recruits while zipping back to my base to click an upgrade just at the optimal moment, and I imagine myself like the food critic in Ratatouille being transported back to his childhood. There is something that just works about the mental coordination and almost musical hotkey strokes in this type of game – even all these years later – and developer Frost Giant gets that.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Stormgate Early Access Gameplay Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>They've also clearly put a lot of thought into what could be improved about that experience. And it's here that I feel like the conversations I've had with people glibly calling it "StarCraft 1.5" are not seeing the big picture. On an underlying design level, it's a thoughtful progression even from the flash and polish of StarCraft 2. And that's the most important part.</p><p>Stormgate sits fairly comfortably somewhere between StarCraft 2 and Warcraft 3 in terms of the moment-to-moment gameplay, though it feels a bit more like the former in skirmish and PvP due to the fact that those modes don't use heroes. However, like Warcraft 3, both modes feature creep camps – neutral creatures clustered at specific locations – that can be slain for a number of useful buffs from a temporary increase in movement speed to an ongoing trickle of resources. And this ends up creating a lot more interesting decisions in terms of positioning and map control.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Stormgate sits fairly comfortably between StarCraft 2 and Warcraft 3.</p></div><p>StarCraft can, at times, feel like fighting with knives taped to a comically long pole, where the main goal is to cut your opponent's jugular from severa l paces away before they get yours. Camps give you a reason to care about and fight over more places on the map than just yours and your opponent's expansion bases, which meant I found myself fighting a lot more mid-map engagements of varying sizes. It also allows for more ways to stage an army for a big push, or hold a key junction. Drops and base harassment still happen, but I didn't feel like they were so ubiquitous. And that's nice.</p><p>That said, PvP balance is definitely still a work-in-progress. We got a patch just last week as I'm writing this addressing some problem match-ups, and it's a lot of huge, haymaker nerfs and buffs. But I would expect that from a competitive RTS at the beginning of its Early Access journey. Be prepared to face some weird and aggravating nonsense in ranked games while they get that ironed out.</p><p>As a Terran and Human main in StarCraft and Warcraft respectively, it's no surprise that the faction that spoke to me the most in Stormgate was the Human Vanguard. I know, I'm really fun at parties. They play very similarly to a standard RTS faction, making them a great point of entry. But like almost everything in Stormgate, there are little things here and there that raise the skill ceiling a lot.</p><p>Vanguard units gain veterancy from fighting, for instance, which increases their stats substantially. This means, to play them at a high level, you want to minimize casualties as much as possible in every engagement. And you especially don't want to lose your fully-promoted units. This might, unexpectedly, make them one of the most micro-heavy factions if you want to truly master their advantages. And it presents an opportunity for their opponents to focus-fire down veteran units as well. This sort of, "Easy to learn, difficult to master" philosophy is all over Stormgate, and I love to see it.</p><p>The Vanguard's exact opposites are the edgelord Infernal Host, a demonic army from space that can store up summoning charges at their production buildings and amasses energy for their top bar abilities when units die – including their own. They encourage a gleefully swarmy, high-pressure playstyle where you don't necessarily want to simply throw the lives of your legions away, but you're not going to sweat the losses as long as you win the battle.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The "Easy to learn, difficult to master" philosophy is all over Stormgate.</p></div><p>More killing leads to more demonic power, which can let you drop temporary shroud totems – think of this as their versi on of Zerg creep – and then give a temporary buff to everyone standing around it. If you know how to capitalize on momentum, you can turn one mildly successful push into a runaway victory before the opponent can catch their breath, which is always satisfying.</p><p>The Celestial Armada is the faction I've spent the least time with overall, and they also seem like the hardest to get into. While the Vanguard accumulates energy over time and the Infernals get it from units dying, the Celestials require a special base structure to generate Power, which is used for global abilities and required to run all of their buildings. I frankly never got the hang of this, but I wasn't able to spend dozens of hours with every single faction for this Early Access review, so we can put a pin in it. Their units are very slick, and considering how many times I got my ass handed to me by a Celestial player, it seems like they do pretty well at the direction of a seasoned commander.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Up until now, I've been mostly talking about the competitive PvP mode, which is where Stormgate currently shines the brightest. So that would make the campaign – which is currently only six, 15- to 20-minute missions, with more to come in the future – sort of the grimy underside. Everything about it feels kind of low budget, though the mission design is reasonably varied and I did enjoy Warcraft loremaster Chris Metzen dealing AOE damage to the scenery as Maloc, a demonic lieutenant straight out of the Saturday morning cartoon realm.</p><p>The story is… well, I don't want to just come right out and spoil it. But there have been many jokes made in the past about how Blizzard knows how to tell exactly one story. And this is that story again, just with different characters. Or at least, it seems to be. Maybe they'll surprise us in future episodes. Wait, wait, hear me out… what if there were <em>five </em>Frostmournes?</p><p>My biggest let-down with the campaign, though, in addition to the fact that you can finish it in an afternoon, is that it only features the Vanguard as playable so far. I'm sure there are Infernal and Celestial chapters planned. But compared to even StarCraft 1, in which we spent multiple hours with each faction, I think this really hurts the onboarding. You get a decent idea of what the humans are about by playing as them, and a fair bit of info on the Infernals by fighting against them. But the Celestials haven't even shown up yet. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The currently brief, Vanguard-only campaign really hurts onboarding.</p></div><p>That means one of the game's three playable factions has barely any lore context at the moment, which makes it hard for me to get excited about them. What are they even doing here? What are their ideals? What is their society about? Almost everything we know comes from an announcement trailer and unit descriptions.</p><p>Similarly, I've always learned how to play each faction in most prior RTSes from their campaign missions first. Different missions can highlight different units or faction mechanics, and ease you into thinking about how to use them. It can be very intimidating to simply jump into PvP and sink or swim. Stormgate currently doesn't feature much help for new players in terms of how to think about Infernal shroud, or the neat things you can do with Celestial Arcships. There's a "Learn to Play" link on the main menu, but it just sends you to a web page with some short YouTube videos. I don't know… does that even count?</p><p>Novice players can enable a feature called BuddyBot in non-ranked matches that helps you out with some busywork like base management, but I honestly find this to be the worst kind of assistance. It doesn't actually teach you how to play. It just does things for you. I'd much prefer a "buddy" that notices when I'm doing things like banking too many resources and pops up with some tips on what I could improve.</p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><h3>Len's Top 10 RTSes</h3><p>The 10 Best RTS games to play in 2024!</p></div><p>The saving grace here might be the 3vAI co-op mode, which lets you pick heroes from each of the three factions and fight for objectives like shutting down enemy spawn points or intercepting convoys. The lower difficulties are very forgiving, and probably the closest thing Stormgate has to a shallow end of the pool where you can start to familiarize yourself with its mechanics. The Warcraft 3-style heroes with hotbar abilities also bring a bit more variety and micro to the formula. And they have some pretty cool meta-progression, including new units that replace some of the base faction ones, like Blockade's tanky Crusader.</p><p>There are only five heroes so far – and one of them is a $10 DLC purchase, which seems a bit steep to me. Also, who is this guy? He looks like a fallen Celestial? What's the story here? We need more lore!</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
PC and PlayStation console exclusive live-service shooter Concord launches next week, if you recall, and so today Sony has set out its plans to keep the game fresh for at least three seasons. 
</p>
<p>
When the game arrives next week, priced £35, you'll find six modes, 12 maps and 16 characters included. This will then be expanded in October when Season 1 arrives, and then again in both January and April 2025 when Season 2 and 3 turn up. 
</p>
<p>
Season 1's launch in October will add a new map, character, story scenes and more. Season 2 will bring another new map, character and set of story scenes, plus a fresh mode. Season 3 - for now - remains under wraps.
</p>
<p>
Season 1 will also add an in-game store, where you can customise your characters with cosmetic-only options. Otherwise, the above content all comes at no additional cost to those who buy the base game - and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sonys-next-live-service-sci-fi-shooter-concord-wont-have-a-battle-pass">there's no battle pass</a>.

<p>"Concord feels like a load of brilliant games combined - but is that enough?" Chris Tapsell wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/concord-feels-like-a-load-of-brilliant-games-combined-but-is-that-enough">Eurogamer's Concord preview</a>. "The true hook with Concord, I suspect, will reveal itself once it's in the hands of its audience, as they wrestle with optimal combinations and strategies and the meta begins to congeal." </p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2024-concord-is-a-technically-solid-well-made-hero-shooter-with-much-potential">Digital Foundry, meanwhile</a>, has dubbed Concord a "technically solid, well-made hero shooter" with "potential".</p>
<p>
If you've stumped up for Concord's digital deluxe edition you can play from 6pm UK time on 20th August. Otherwise, you can play from 6pm UK time on 23rd August.
