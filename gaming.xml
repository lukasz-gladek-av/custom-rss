			<p>The Portal 2 RTX Remix path tracing mod looks <a href="https://wccftech.com/portal-2-rtx-remix-path-tracing-mod/">incredible</a>, but its improvements come at a very high cost, as path tracing in the game is so demanding that it utterly destroys performance at 4K resolution on an RTX 4080 GPU.</p>
<p>A new comparison put together by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@MxBenchmarkPC" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MxBenchmarkPC</a> does a great job highlighting how demanding path tracing can be. At native 4K resolution, the framerate drops from around 200 and 300+ FPS to the low 20s and 30s range, depending on the scenario, on an RTX 4080 GPU, which should be more than capable of delivering higher framerates even with path tracing. For playable framerates, Portal 2 RTX Remix essentially requires NVIDIA DLSS and Frame Generation to push past the 60 FPS range at 1440p and 1080p resolutions in some scenarios.</p>

The mod was never intended to support the game, and the game effects are rendered using shaders, so you should expect to experience some other issues besides the low performance.</p>
<p>Portal 2 is the second entry in the series created by Valve, introducing a variety of improvements over its predecessor, including a separate two-player cooperative campaign.

The sequel has already been controversial, as the feature film started off as a Disney+ series and has been reworked into a theatrical release. The seemingly panicked pivot to put a sequel to a successful film in theaters following the box office bomb of 2022’s <em>Strange World </em>and the disappointing performance of 2023’s <em>Wish</em> suggests that Disney is retreating to sequels above new ideas, which is discouraging. Next year’s movie is <em>Zootopia 2</em>. A third <em>Frozen </em>is coming in 2027. I loved <em>Zootopia </em>and <em>Frozen</em>, and that shit still sounds bleak to me. But before this pivot to sequels, Disney’s latest era has been full of bangers. Some call the movies that started with 2008’s <em>Bolt</em> the “revival” era, and it’s an apt description considering how excellent some of these movies have been. So we figured we’d rank them as we get ready to see what’s next with the arrival of <em>Moana 2</em>. We’ll probably update this list after we see the movie this week. For now, here’s the best and worst of Disney’s modern era. </p></div><div><p><em>Wish </em>is a hot mess. The 2023 film was meant to be a celebration of Disney’s 100th anniversary, and it instead ended up being one of the low points of the company’s animated canon. Yes, it’s gorgeously animated, employing a beautiful marriage of watercolor and 3D animation styles, and its music, penned by Julia Michaels and Benjamin Rice, is lovely, albeit undermined by awkward lyrics. But beyond that, it’s an incoherent, clichéd story that’s only notable for suggesting that numerous Disney characters and concepts all emerge from the same shared universe. It might end up giving <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/wish-kingdom-hearts-4-asha-magnifico-sora-1851050123&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/wish-kingdom-hearts-4-asha-magnifico-sora-1851050123"><em>Kingdom Hearts</em> some cool tools to work with</a></span> for its Disney crossovers, but it’s a movie that’s mostly better off forgotten. However, Chris Pine’s King Magnifico is in the running for hottest Disney villain. So it’s got that going for it.</p></div><div><p>2018’s <em>Ralph Breaks the Internet </em>still confounds me six years later. Modern Disney may be pretty synonymous with bleeding a property dry, but that tendency historically was not reflected by Walt Disney Animation Studios itself, which typically made one movie and then moved onto something else, leaving the other arms of Disney to do all the direct-to-video sequels and animated series. This sequel to 2012’s <em>Wreck-It Ralph</em>, however,<em> </em>was an arbiter for what would come, as Disney has become a sequel machine in the years since. However, <em>Ralph Breaks the Internet </em>is such an odd pivot from the video game tribute of its predecessor that it makes the entire “series” feel like an amorphous, malleable thing for Disney to play with. The heroes of <em>Ralph Breaks the Internet </em>enter a physical recreation of the world-wide web, including search engines, social media, online games, and what essentially equates to a digital theme park based on Disney properties. Sure, it’s got some great scenes, like when Vanellope meets the Disney Princesses, but the movie feels like an attempt to replicate <em>Inside Out</em>’s clever realization of concepts of thought, but without the thematic coherence to make it a compelling story. It’s a theme park experience of a movie, just throwing a variety of things at you to make you laugh and entertain you while narrative and meaning falls by the wayside, which is at least one thing that makes it consistent with the first film.</p></div><div><p>There are a few movies more forgotten in the current era of Disney than <em>Bolt</em>, and that’s despite it arguably being the movie that brought the company into a new age. Its premise of a superpowered spy dog actor having a fish-out-of-water experience as he breaks containment is a ton of fun, though today it feels a little dated by its early 2000s, Dreamworks-style smarminess. <em>Bolt </em>may not have had the staying power of the movies that would follow it, but we likely wouldn’t have had modern classics like <em>Tangled </em>and <em>Frozen </em>had it not been for <em>Bolt</em>’s story about letting go of a glamorous life for a simple one with the people you love.</p></div><div><p>While the <em>Winnie the Pooh </em>franchise is certainly not forgotten, it does feel like the 2011 film has been lost amidst the bigger hits of Disney’s past decade. The movie carries the distinction of being the last 2D animated film Disney has released in a theater, which is fitting, as it does feel like the last bastion of a different era. Its animation style is one thing, but it’s also distinct from most movies on this list for not adhering to the same tendency toward quippy dialogue and sassy heroes that typify modern Disney. It’s simple, and that makes it refreshing compared to most movies Disney puts out these days. </p></div><div><p>It’s a shame that <em>Raya and the Last Dragon </em>came out when it did, a year into the covid-19 pandemic, because it didn’t have the chance to be the ticket-driving cultural phenomenon that so many Disney movies get to be. The Kelly Marie Tran-led film has a lot going for it, including a story that feels timely and relevant as it examines warring tribes divided by distrust, eventually brought together by a younger generation who fights to reunite the people. It also has some of the best action scenes in Disney’s catalog as it draws inspiration from classic martial arts films. The film’s mythology is interesting in a vacuum but <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2021/03/the-fantasy-southeast-asia-of-raya-and-the-last-dragon/618222/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/culture/archive/2021/03/the-fantasy-southeast-asia-of-raya-and-the-last-dragon/618222/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">was subject to criticism</a></span> when viewed through the lens of its Southeast Asian influence. <em>Raya and the Last Dragon </em>has its heart in the right place and is wonderfully acted and animated. It just maybe could have used another pass or two.</p></div><div><p>I was outnumbered on this one. In my opinion, <em>Wreck-It Ralph</em> is a cool idea with messy execution. Its early scenes, like a group therapy session showing the titular arcade game baddy working it out alongside video game icons like <em>Mario</em>’s Bowser, <em>Street FIghter</em>’s Zangief, and <em>Sonic</em>’s Eggman, feel like vignettes from a more focused movie. <em>Wreck-It Ralph </em>is a pretty good Disney movie but a half-hearted video game tribute. It starts strong with a bunch of really good cameos in the beginning, but loses its grip on its premise as the movie goes on. That being said, Ralph and Vanellope’s respective journeys to self-actualization in the face of pushback from society are still wonderful and heartfelt. The fact that the sequel loses the plot even more has retroactively soured me on <em>Wreck-It Ralph</em>, but others at <em>Kotaku</em> enjoy it more than I do, so it gets an upward nudge.</p></div><div><p>Like <em>Winnie the Pooh</em>, <em>The Princess and the Frog </em>feels like a relic of the past compared to other movies on this list. The last 2D animated film featuring a Disney Princess remains a sore spot for some in the studio’s canon because it has been wielded in debates about the company’s trajectory and the perceived marketability of films starring a Black woman protagonist. But on its own, <em>The Princess and the Frog </em>is a delightful, classic Disney affair that shuns the company’s usual musical theater sound in favor of a gospel-infused, soulful, jazzy soundtrack fitting for its 1920s New Orleans setting. <em>The Princess and the Frog </em>turns a fairytale standard into a period piece, following Princess Tiana’s rise from rags to riches. It’s one of Disney’s most interesting spins on the fairytales it usually draws from, and despite the bullshit that surrounded it, Tiana has had staying power alongside her Disney Princess contemporaries.</p></div><div><p><em>Strange World</em> is one of Disney’s most criminally underrated movies, full stop. The pulpy adventure film incorporates the Disney-standard generational trauma narrative to great effect as it follows three generations of the Clade family. Each has an idea of who their family is meant to be, and as the grandfather, father, and son of the family each reckon with their own beliefs, <em>Strange World </em>also delivers some of the most visually stunning animation Disney has ever put into (not enough) theaters. <em>Strange World </em>takes inspiration from adventure films like <em>Indiana Jones</em>, while also weaving in environmentalist themes propped up by a gorgeous alien universe. The titular world is made up of stunning, otherworldly vistas, lively characters both human and otherwise, and fascinating creatures that are, well, strange. And while its world is full of weirdness, its conflicts remain pretty human. The Clade family struggles to understand each other, and it takes reaching dangerous, unexplored places to consider the obvious. Tragically, Disney undermarketed the film, making it one of the biggest box office bombs in history. If you’ve got a Disney+ account, the movie is streaming, and it fucking rules. God, it deserved better.</p></div><div><p><em>Strange World</em> is one of Disney’s most criminally underrated movies, full stop.

God, it deserved better.</p></div><div><p>I fucking love <em>Encanto</em>. I do not like half of its soundtrack. Lin-Manuel Miranda and I have never quite gelled, and that doesn’t change when his music is attached to an otherwise excellent film. “We Don’t Talk About Bruno” is one of my karaoke go-tos, but otherwise I find most of <em>Encanto</em>’s music either plagued by Miranda’s usual grating sing-talky style or just dreadfully dull compared to that of most Disney movies. With that giant boulder pushed out of the way, <em>Encanto </em>is probably the best exploration of the generational trauma Disney has become synonymous with. It follows the Madrigal family, who have been gifted superhuman powers with which to aid their community. Those powers also come with the great weight of expectation from heroine Mirabel’s grandmother, who has been the matriarchal backbone of the family since she escaped a war-torn Colombia with her children. <em>Encanto </em>portrays a family fractured by expectations with a great deal of empathy for each generation. It’s cathartic to see younger generations finally find the courage to advocate for themselves after years of being held to an unreachable standard, and <em>Encanto </em>shows that, within reason, even the most fractured connections can be repaired.</p></div><div><p><em>Zootopia </em>is a complex onion of a movie to unpack because it has its heart in the right place but its mixed messages have made it harder to go back to in the years since it premiered in 2016. On the surface, <em>Zootopia </em>is a film about prejudice. Its titular metropolis is meant to be a paradise where anthropomorphic predators and prey live together in harmony. Rookie cop Judy Hopps moves to the city and discovers that idealized vision is not as it seems, and is forced to reckon with her own privilege after seeing how the social hierarchy affects predators like con-man fox Nick Wilde. The core allegorical premise is strong, and leads to some of the most emotionally affecting moments in recent Disney memory, it’s the pro-cop framing that feels harder to swallow eight years later. Sure, the movie examines the “bad apples” in the system, but feels largely uncritical of the institution it idolizes. It’s a Disney movie, so it’s not going to be particularly radical in its thinking. Its discussions of prejudice and privilege are apt and it does a good job of presenting those in a way that the average child (or adult, let’s be frank) might take something away from, but I’m interested to see if next year’s <em>Zootopia 2 </em>interrogates some of its core premises, though I’m not holding my breath. All that said, <em>Zootopia </em>has some of Disney’s sharpest writing, funniest comedic setpieces, and best performances from Ginnifer Goodwin and Jason Bateman as its two leads. Nick remains one of my favorite Disney characters. I’m a mark first and a hater second. I can’t wait to see these two in theaters again next year.</p></div><div><p>It’s been 10 years since <em>Big Hero 6</em>, and I’m surprised that it’s still the only Marvel property to get an official Disney animated adaptation since the company acquired the comic book maker back in 2009. <em>Big Hero 6 </em>is a loose adaptation of one of Marvel’s more obscure properties, and what sticks out to me all these years later is its exploration of grief, which it notably examines through the experience of a young boy. <em>Big Hero 6 </em>is a superhero origin story for protagonist Hiro Hamada, but more than that, it’s an extended, action-packed therapy session as he learns to let go of his anger and to embody the best parts of those he’s lost. This is all facilitated by Baymax, one of Disney’s most instantly likable characters in recent memory. The puffy, robotic doctor is a source of some of the film’s best gags, but is also the movie’s beating heart, embodying the transformative themes of <em>Big Hero 6</em> with each scene he’s in. I’d say the movie left me wanting more, but since it led to an animated sequel series and a Disney+ spin-off, we haven’t exactly been lacking for stuff set in the film’s universe, even if Disney hasn’t pushed for a proper sequel yet like it has with numerous other recent hits.</p></div><div><p>The final three on our list are widely considered to be the modern classics of Disney’s revival era, and I could easily see any of them in the top spot on any given day. But we can’t give them a three-way tie for first place (I mean, I don’t <em>think</em> we can), so I’ve gotta give <em>Moana </em>the third-place spot. Moana’s journey from a begrudging leader to a bold, trailblazing one takes her across oceans she’s only ever dreamed of, having been kept sequestered on her home island by her parents her whole life. But dreaming of something is one thing; reckoning with the reality of what you feel you’re capable of is much harder. <em>Moana </em>is a story of self-doubt and resilience, and knowing that the two feelings intermingle. Accomplishing anything means always finding your way back to the latter.</p><p>Thankfully, <em>Moana </em>leans less into Lin-Manuel Miranda’s more annoying bag of musical tricks than <em>Encanto </em>did, and Auliʻi Cravalho’s soaring vocals deliver empowering anthems that elevate the film’s most emotional beats. I’m curious to see if <em>Moana 2 </em>can live up to its predecessor with new songwriters at the helm.</p></div><div><p>2010’s <em>Tangled </em>was the blueprint for modern Disney before it reached near caricature status with <em>Wish</em>. The studio’s take on Rapunzel’s story is full of youthful joy, sharp wit, delightful earworms, and top-of-the-class animation. As a first attempt to bring the Disney Princess formula into 3D animation, Disney got it in one. Mandy Moore and Zachary Levi (damn, talk about a drop-off) have great chemistry as Rapunzel and rogueish criminal Eugene, and Broadway veteran Donna Murphy is brilliantly cast as Rapunzel’s scheming mother. Disney’s depiction of Rapunzel as a sheltered but exuberant young woman looking for a life beyond the monotonous one she’s suffered her whole life inspired multiple Disney heroines in the decade that followed. Even after all those imitators, however, Rapunzel still feels like one of the most genuine depictions of the archetype. Her story ends in the tower where it began, but she and Eugene return to the prison changed, both willing to sacrifice themselves for the other. Those selfless expressions are what ultimately free them from their old lives and allow them to find something new together.</p></div><div><p>If <em>Tangled </em>was Disney establishing that it could translate its previous successes into 3D, <em>Frozen </em>was a subversion of what everyone believed a Princess movie to be. The 2013 adaptation of “The Snow Queen” is built upon pulling the rug out from under you. For most of its run, it’s an endlessly charming story about two sisters who have been driven apart by fear, to the point that when they grow up, they barely know each other. One has been taught to fear the other, and the other has been made to fear herself. It puts them at a standstill, desiring closeness but unable to facilitate it. But this is a Disney movie, and as far as popular culture believes, Princess Anna doesn’t need her sister, she just needs to find a man and then her life will begin. First leaning into most people’s expectations of the Disney formula, <em>Frozen </em>then stabs viewers in the back, twists the knife, and kicks them down a stairwell. It’s both a pointed commentary on the blind spots in the company’s earlier work and a declaration of the studio’s ethos moving forward. That on its own makes <em>Frozen </em>one of the best films Disney has ever put in a theater, but the pitch-perfect casting of Idina Menzel and Kristen Bell helped shape two of the most recognizable pop culture characters of the past decade. The two leads give voice to some of the best songs in Disney’s catalog, tying together what remains the best example of a modern classic Disney has to its name. <em>Frozen II</em>’s exploration of Anna and Elsa builds beautifully on top of the original’s foundation, but even if it hadn’t, the story of two sisters reuniting without fear still exemplifies the best that Disney has to offer.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>New <a href="https://wccftech.com/red-dead-redemption-pc-comparison-8k-rtx-4070/">Red Dead Redemption</a> mods released online in the past few days offer various visual improvements, new gameplay features, and better historical accuracy for guns.</p>
<p>The first one of these mods is the <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/reddeadredemption/mods/454" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Upscaled Everything mod</a>, which doesn't yet upscale every texture in the game as the name would suggest but brings significant improvements to a variety of objects, such as wanted posters, blood splats, bullet holes, the moon, and John Marston himself. The mod creator also confirmed that every other texture yet to be upscaled eventually will, but it will require some time.</p>

<p>The second of these new Red Dead Redemption mods is one that gun buffs and those looking to make the game a more historically accurate experience should consider. <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/reddeadredemption/mods/461?tab=description">The Guns of the Old West Historical Overhaul mod</a> renames in-game weapons to reflect their real-life counterparts.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/06-1.webp"></a></figure>

<p>The third and final new Red Dead Redemption is the only one that introduces a new gameplay feature - <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/reddeadredemption/mods/451?tab=description">a first-person view mode</a> for increased immersion. As the game was never intended to be played in first person, there are some clipping issues, such as when riding a horse, but outside these issues, the game should be fully playable with a modded camera view. The modder also recommends using the<a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/reddeadredemption/mods/26" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> ClipTweaks - FPS-DOF-FOV mod</a> for a higher field of view if needed.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/07-1.webp"></a></figure>

<p>Red Dead Redemption is finally available on PC, 14 years after its original release on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. The game is also available on PlayStation consoles and Nintendo Switch and is fully playable on Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S via backward compatibility.</p>

            <p>
A <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/sniper-elite">Sniper Elite</a> battle royale spin-off has reportedly been cancelled, after Chinese gaming giant <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/tencent">Tencent</a> pulled funding.
</p>
<p>
That's according to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/exclusive-sniper-elites-battle-royale-game-has-been-canceled-as-tencent-pulls-funding/">Insider Gaming</a>, which states that Project Archipelago: Sniper Battle Royale was recently scrapped following public playtests over the summer. 
</p>
<p>
That report claims Tencent got cold feet on the project after seeing the high-profile <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/concord-pulled-from-sale-as-sony-admits-our-initial-launch-didnt-land">flop of PlayStation's recent live-service bid Concord</a>.

<p>
Sniper Elite developer Rebellion declined to comment on the report. Eurogamer has contacted it and Tencent for more.
</p>
<p>
British developer Rebellion announced "pre-alpha access" to Project Archipelago via a three-day playtest back in mid-August this year, though has been quiet on the game since. 
</p>
<p>
A trailer for the project showed squads of snipers picking off enemies from afar, in rusted, near-future environments that featured a mix of weathered contemporary buildings but also sci-fi-looking airships.
</p>
<p>
It's understood that there have been no job losses as a result of the cancellation, with developers moved over to the next main Sniper Elite game, Sniper Elite: Resistance, which is due to launch on 28th January 2025.
</p>
<p>"Currently, we are still in the process of learning," <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-reflects-on-concords-failed-launch-and-removal-after-two-weeks">Sony boss Hiroki Totoki said this month of Concord's launch and sudden removal from sale</a>. "And basically, with regards to new IP, of course, you don't know the result until you actually try it."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Silent Hill 2 continues to be not where it should be on a system like the PlayStation 5 Pro, and the improvements introduced in the latest patch released last week are not enough to significantly improve the game on the mid-generation console.</p>
<p>The tech experts at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@DigitalFoundry" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Digital Foundry</a> recently took a good look at how the game's aforementioned <a href="https://wccftech.com/silent-hill-2-patch-1-06-playstation-5-pro/">1.06 patch</a> improves the game on PlayStation 5 Pro over the previous update, which introduced PSSR support that led to more issues than benefits in terms of visual quality. For the new patch, in Performance Mode, developer Bloober Team actually went back to TSR for Performance Mode, and the benefits are evident, as global illumination and reflections are more stable and less noisy, and there's no more massive disocclusion when moving the camera as in the previous version of the game. However, in general, image quality is not so different from the base model, and the slightly better performance may be due to the different cost of TSR over PSSR and not due to any actual improvement.</p>
<p>One thing that is very surprising in the latest version of Silent Hill 2 on PlayStation 5 Pro is that the game looks better in Performance Mode than in Quality Mode, as the latter still uses PSSR, which isn't a very good fit at the time for the types of visuals the game pushes. Performance is a little more stable than on the base model, but in terms of image quality, it still leaves a lot to be desired, requiring more work to actually get to the point where it should be on a system like the PS5 Pro.</p>
<p><iframe title="Silent Hill 2 PS5 Pro Patched: Are The Image Quality Problems Fixed? It's Complicated..." width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/giugvMWCclY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Technical issues aside, Silent Hill 2 is a more than worthy game to get not only for fans of the series but for any survival horror fan, as Bloober Team did an excellent job remaking what is widely considered one of the best entries in the Konami series. You can learn more about the game in Chris's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/silent-hill-2-restless-dreams-town/">review.</a></p>

            <p>As anyone who’s ever glanced at some of the better entries at <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TwoSentenceHorror">r/twosentencehorror</a> will tell you, the genre thrives on restrictions. Here's a creepy good 'un: "'Please, God, don't let it look in the closet,’ I silently prayed. 'Please, God, don't let it look in the closet,' it parroted back from the next room." You can't do that with baby shoes, you anonymous hack!</p>
<p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/silent-hill-2-remake">Silent Hill 2 remake</a>’s senior narrative designer Barbara Kciuk reckons this principle extends to much bigger productions. "It is a bit niche, but actually, the interesting part about <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-horror-games">horror</a> is that it is one of the best ratios when it comes to the cost of production and the earnings," she recently <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/silent-hill-2-remake-bloober-team-interview-struggles-backlash-positive-reviews/">told TheGamer’s Rhiannon Bevan</a>.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"If you take Paranormal Activity, it cost pennies and it made millions," Kciuk continued. TheGamer follow up in their article with The <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/blair-witch">Blair Witch</a> Project, Get Out, and Terrifier 3 as examples of low budget horror films that made a lot more than they cost. Get Out, for example, was the highest grossing debut based on an original screenplay in history as of 2017, raking in over $250 million worldwide on a budget $4.5 million.</p>
<p>"This is one of the genres in both film and games where you actually can take very little resources, and the game or the movie looking cheap might actually be an advantage," Kciuk went on, citing the success of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/buckshot-roulette">Buckshot Roulette</a>. "It's a very small game, and it was done in like a month or two, and it earned millions of dollars. Horror tends to have those breakout hits from very small teams, or even solo developers."</p>
<p>I imagine that Kciuk doesn’t actually find spreadsheeting to be “the interesting part” about making horror. More, as she alludes to, the freedom to make some very effective work with limited resources. The proliferation of PSX-style horror speaks to her assertion that "the game or the movie looking cheap might actually be an advantage". I’m reminded, fittingly, of how the original <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/silent-hill-2">Silent Hill 2</a> turned short draw distances into an aesthetic with that game’s iconic fog. There’s some great examples of horror cinema turning restrictions into innovation, too, like Sam Raimi’s shaky cam and travelling shots in The Evil Dead 2.</p><p>Still, this is also might be somewhat of a self-fulfilling prophecy based on how few truly big-budget horror games actually gets made. Outside of Capcom’s <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/resident-evil">Resident Evil</a> series, and the occasional outlier <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/alien-isolation-sales-figures-2-1-million">like Alien Isolation</a>, the fact that horror appears cost-effective might just be the result of small budget horror making up most of what’s available. There are also big games that suggest the opposite, like the recent <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/alan-wake-2">Alan Wake 2</a> - one of my personal favourites from recent years that’s <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/alan-wake-2-still-hasnt-quite-made-its-money-back-according-to-remedys-latest-financials">still struggling to recoup development costs</a>.</p>

<p>New data reveals that Game of the Year nominee Balatro has generated approximately $4.4 million on its mobile version.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.pocketgamer.biz/royal-kingdom-records-450k-in-first-four-days-to-beat-royal-matchs-debut/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PocketPair</a>, which obtained the data via <a href="https://appmagic.rocks/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">AppMagic</a>, revealed the new data. According to the data, Balatro generated $1 million in its first week, and following a spending surge last week, that number quickly rose to $4.4 million.</p>



<p>It is unclear why the surge in purchases increased, but the game was nominated for several awards last week, which almost certainly attributed to its rise in popularity. The game received several awards at different events, including five at <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-game-awards-2024-all-nominees-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Geoff Keighley’s Game Awards 2024</a>, including Game of the Year and Best Mobile Game.</p>



<p>Balatro was first released on February 20, 2024, and saw huge success on launch, generating $1 million in its first eight hours of release. It sold 250,000 units in its first three days and 500,000 copies in its first ten days. In August 2024, it was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/balatro-hits-2-million-units-sold-major-gameplay-update-coming-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced that the game had sold two million copies</a>. The game received universal acclaim according to review aggregator Metacritic.</p>



<p>In August 2024, Balatro announced its first major crossover with some of the most popular games, including The Witcher 3, Among Us, Vampire Surivors, and Dave the Diver. </p>

            <p>
Mac Walters, the veteran writer and producer who worked on <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mass-effect">Mass Effect</a> for almost two decades, has announced a "pause" in operations at his new AAA game studio, Worlds Untold. 
</p>
<p>
Its team had been developing a near-future action adventure game set "in a breathtaking world filled with mystery and exploration", backed by investment cash from Chinese game giant NetEase.
</p>
<p>
Last night, however, Walters announced that the studio was now seeking "a new partner to help bring our vision to life", with staff members now looking for work elsewhere in the meantime. 
</p>
<p>
"This is a heartbreaking moment for everyone involved, but I'm deeply grateful for the support of our partners, friends and family, and for the time we've had together at Worlds Untold," Walters wrote in a post on Worlds Untold's <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/worlds-untold_its-hard-to-find-the-right-words-for-this-activity-7267282640670482433-OJta/">LinkedIn</a> page.
</p>
<p>
"While we're pausing for now, this isn't goodbye - there's more to come, and we look forward to sharing the next chapter with you when the time is right."
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mass-effect-veteran-mac-walters-leaves-bioware-after-19-years">Walters confirmed his departure from BioWare in January 2023</a>, after 19 years working on <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/jade-empire">Jade Empire</a> and then Mass Effect as a lead writer for the franchise.
</p>
<p>
Worlds Untold also hosts Dragon Age alum Elizabeth Lehtonen as the studio's head of production, and concept artist Ramil Sunga as its head of art.
</p>
<p>
"As someone who's been at the heart of building out new IPs in the past, I recognise the challenges, but also the opportunities with creating worlds from the ground up," Walters <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/former-mass-effect-lead-writer-says-new-narrative-focused-studio-will-avoid-painting-ourselves-in-a-corner">told Eurogamer last year</a>. 
</p>
<p>
In a statement at the time, NetEase said it hoped Worlds Untold would build franchises "with depth and possibility that can't be contained in a single game, or even a single medium".
</p>
<p>
Walters has discussed his tenure working on Mass Effect at length with Eurogamer on several occasions - in an <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/making-mass-effect-from-the-birth-of-a-trilogy-to-andromeda-and-beyond">in-depth interview with our Bertie on dreaming up plans for an entire trilogy of games</a>, and with myself on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/plotting-a-course-how-mass-effect-3-brought-the-trilogy-to-a-close">how BioWare wrestled its trilogy of storylines and characters to a close</a>.

            <p>Balatro, the indie roguelike inspired by poker, has generated almost $4.4m on mobile alone since its release in September.</p>
<p>That's according to data from AppMagic (thanks <a href="https://www.pocketgamer.biz/balatro-nears-44m-on-mobile-amid-a-sudden-spending-surge/">PocketGamer.biz</a>), which reveals the mobile game made a million dollars in its first week across the App Store and Google Play.</p>
<p>Balatro was first released in February on PC and console, but its popularity has surged following its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/balatro-out-on-mobile-later-this-month">release on mobile platforms</a>.</p>

<p>What's particularly interesting is its release as a premium game for an upfront £9.99, unlike so many free-to-play (with microtransactions) games on mobile.</p>
<p>Balatro is also part of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/topics/apple-arcade">Apple Arcade</a>, meaning even more players have played the game through Apple's subscription, though it's unclear how much money its inclusion here has generated.</p>
<p>On launch day, Balatro made $162k and then peaked at $200k a week after launch on 29th September, resulting in that million dollar first week.</p>
<p>Since then sales have declined but its inclusion as a Game of the Year nominee (among others) at <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/astro-bot-final-fantasy-7-rebirth-lead-this-years-the-game-award-nominations">this year's The Game Awards</a> has caused a resurgence in sales in the last couple of weeks. This resulted in the game's second highest earning week to date, generating $727k.</p>
<p>Developer Localthunk confirmed on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/balatro/comments/1fkp6m0/balatro_mobile_and_iap/">reddit</a> ahead of Balatro's mobile release it would not have microtransactions or "predatory monetisation".</p>
<p>The developer also spoke out, back in March, about the<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/balatro-creator-speaks-out-on-gambling-rating-drama"> game's rating drama</a> after it was pulled from sale in some countries due to a "mistaken belief that the game 'contains prominent gambling imagery and materials that instructs about gambling'". Said Localthunk: "I still believe that the rating is unwarranted, but there is some grey area for interpretation from PEGI and at this point it is what it is."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>The free-to-play third-person shooter game Star Wars: Hunters will debut soon <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2842320/STAR_WARS_Hunters/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on Steam Early Access</a>, as announced yesterday by publisher Zynga (which was <a href="https://wccftech.com/take-two-interactive-completes-merger-with-farmville-publisher-zynga/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">acquired</a> a couple of years ago by Take-Two). Star Wars: Hunters debuted last June on iOS, Android, and Nintendo Switch.</p>
<p>Developed by British studio NaturalMotion, the game focuses on fast-paced 4v4 battles featuring a varied roster of characters to choose from: Ewok Grenadier Pilbush, Zabrak Archer Nox, Imperial Heavy Gunner Sentinel, Wookiee Juggernaught Grozz, Dark Side Assassin Rieve, Rodian Sawbones Skora, Mandalorian Vanguard Aran Tal, Twin Shield Droid K-AOS, Jedi Droid J-3DI, Jawa Scavenger Utooni, Unrelenting Bounty Hunter Imara Vex, Miraluka Sharpshooter Diago, Rebel War Hero Zaina, Mon Calamari Prodigy Sprocket, Droideka Speedster Slingshot, and Trandoshan Trapper Charr. Each character comes with their own weapons and abilities.</p>
<p>Star Wars: Hunters currently features four modes: Squad Brawl, Dynamic Control, Power Control, and Trophy Chase. It was also supposed to <a href="https://wccftech.com/huttball-from-swtor-will-be-available-in-star-wars-hunters-too/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">include</a> Star Wars: The Old Republic's unique Huttball mode, but it seems it was removed before the launch.</p>
<p>While the official PC launch is scheduled for January 27, interested players can sign up right now on the Steam page for the upcoming playtests, which will take place between December 13 and 16 and again between January 10 and 13. The best news, though, is that Star Wars: Hunters will feature full cross-play and cross-progression between all the available platforms. As such, you will be able to carry over your existing progress, provided you connect your Zinga ID account.</p>
<p><iframe title="Star Wars: Hunters™ | PC Announcement Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qubow1v9zFk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The main perk of the PC version will be enhanced graphics compared to the mobile platforms. Even so, the system requirements are very low, as you can see below.</p>
<p><strong><em>Minimum:</em></strong><br>
<em>OS: Windows 10 64-Bit</em><br>
<em>Processor: Intel Core i3-4130 or AMD FX-8320</em><br>
<em>Memory: 4 GB</em><br>
<em>Graphics: Nvidia GeForce GT 730 or AMD Radeon R7 240</em><br>
<em>DirectX: Version 11</em><br>
<em>Storage: 20 GB</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Recommended</strong>:</em><br>
<em>OS: Windows 10 64-Bit</em><br>
<em>Processor: Intel Core i5 4570 or AMD Ryzen 3 1200</em><br>
<em>Memory: 8 GB</em><br>
<em>Graphics: Nvidia GeForce GTX 660 or AMD Radeon R9 270</em><br>
<em>DirectX: Version 11</em><br>
<em>Storage: 20 GB</em></p>
<p><strong><em>Recommended 4K:</em></strong><br>
<em>OS: Windows 10 64-Bit</em><br>
<em>Processor: Intel Core i5 7500 or AMD Ryzen 5 1400</em><br>
<em>Memory: 8 GB</em><br>
<em>Graphics: Nvidia GeForce GTX 1060 6GB or AMD Radeon R9 390X</em><br>
<em>DirectX: Version 11</em><br>
<em>Storage: 20 GB</em></p>
<p>The current plan is to launch Star Wars: Hunters out of early access at some point in the middle of 2025.</p>

<p>ToeJam &amp; Earl in Panic on Funkotron, released in 1993, followed the first ToeJam &amp; Earl game from 1991, continuing the adventures of its whacky alien protagonists. However, it's a straightforward side-scrolling platformer where the previous game was inspired by Rogue.</p>
<p>Vectorman, meanwhile, was released in 1995 and was notable for its pre-rendered 3D models, rivalling those of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/donkey-kong-country">Donkey Kong Country</a> on the SNES.</p>
<p>Wolf of the Battlefield: Mercs, meanwhile, is an earlier game from the platform: a top-down shooter adapted by Sega from the Capcom arcade game.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/11/27/shuhei-yoshida-is-leaving-playstation-after-31-years/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Shuhei Yoshida has announced that he is leaving PlayStation in January 2025, bringing an end to a 31 year stint at the company that has gone hand-in-hand with the 30 years of PlayStation itself.</p>
<p>Making the announcement in <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/11/26/all-good-things-a-look-back-at-shuhei-yoshidas-31-years-with-playstation/">an interview on the PS Blog</a> and PlayStation Podcast, Yoshida-san said:</p>


<p>“I’ve been with PlayStation from the beginning, and this is my 31st year with PlayStation. And when I hit 30 years, I was thinking, hmm, it may be about time for me to move on. You know, the company’s been doing great. I love PS5, I love the games that are coming out on this platform. And we have new generations of management who I respect and admire. And I’m so excited for the future of PlayStation.</p>
<p>“So you know, PlayStation is in really good hands. I thought, okay, this is my time.”</p>
<p>One of the first members of the PlayStation project at Sony in February 1993, Yoshida-san is best known for his stint as&nbsp;President of PlayStation Studios from 2008 to 2019 (then known as SIE Worldwide Studios). In that time he was the steward to the PlayStation 3’s continued revival through the second half of the generation, helped to being indie gaming to PlayStation in a major way through the PlayStation Store, and was one of PlayStation’s main figureheads around the time of the PlayStation 4 launch, affectionately known as Shu throughout the PlayStation fanbase.</p>

<p>He even featured in one of the single defining moments of the run up to the PS4 and Xbox One launch, featuring in a video alongside Adam Boyes as the company dunked on Microsoft’s unpopular planned changes to physical game ownership and digital rights at that time.</p>
<p><iframe title="Official PlayStation Used Game Instructional Video" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kWSIFh8ICaA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Since stepping down from head of PlayStation Studios in 2019, Yoshida-san has had the role of Head of Indies Initiative at PlayStation. This has largely taken him out of the spotlight, though indie games have been on of his biggest passions over the last 15 years.</p>
<p>“One time stood out for me in my memory as something really, really special was when Journey got the Game of the Year Award,” he explained. “Journey was distributed through PlayStation Network. It was a digital-only, small game. You can finish playing the game within like three hours.</p>
<p>“But that game…[won] Game of the Year against all these AAA titles, I think for the first time in the industry….the creator Jenova Chen did a talk at the summit, and he talked about a letter he received from a girl who lost her father and she thought about her father and she was able to move on in her life.</p>
<p>“The whole audience stood up and the whole room was filled with happiness and an amazing feeling that this small game could have such a big impact on people’s lives.”</p>
<p>We wish him all the best with whatever he has planned next.</p>

            <p>The next round of cards joining <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/pokemon-trading-card-game-pocket">Pokémon TCG Pocket</a> have leaked ahead of December's events.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-tcg-pockets-next-events-revealed-in-datamine">datamines revealed multiple cards and events arriving in December</a> with gen one starter Bulbasaur and its evolutions as the focus.</p>
<p>Now, thanks to a new update of the app, promo cards for the next Wonder Pick and Solo Battle events have leaked. And yes, Bulbasaur is included.</p>

<p>As shared on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PTCGP/comments/1h01lva/new_app_update_confirms_new_promo_cards_for/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">reddit</a>, the following Pokémon will feature and all have new card artwork: Jigglypuff, Onix, Greninja, Haunter, Bulbasaur, and Magnemite.</p>
<p>The latter two are particularly important as they reportedly will be the focus of the forthcoming Wonder Pick event. That Onix artwork looks a little interesting though.</p>
<p>These cards will all feature in a Venusaur PvE event set to begin on 29th November and run until 13th December. Much like the Lapras Ex event, players will battle against AI in solo battles for the rewards.</p>
<p>Pokémon TCG Pocket has already proven incredibly popular since its launch last month - in its first three weeks it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-tcg-pocket-has-already-surpassed-120m-since-release">surpassed $120m in total earnings</a>.</p>
<p>Don't forget to also <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/psa-dont-forget-to-spend-your-pokemon-tcg-pocket-pack-points">spend your pack points</a>: these are earned by opening booster packs and can be spent on specific cards, but they have an unknown expiry date.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>In the span of a few hours, two promising projects from former Mass Effect developers were abruptly halted. Both were sci-fi titles that fans hoped could be reminiscent of BioWare's acclaimed RPG saga.</p>
<p>The first one, as <a href="https://wccftech.com/mass-effect-director-shuts-down-his-new-studio-due-to-lack-of-funding/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported</a> two days ago, was Casey Hudson's Humanoid Origin studio, which had to be shut down due to a sudden lack of funding. A few hours ago, Mac Walters announced similar news (though not as dire) for his Worlds Untold studio <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/worlds-untold_its-hard-to-find-the-right-words-for-this-activity-7267282640670482433-OJta/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">via LinkedIn</a>.</p>
<p>As you might recall, Mac Walters, a writer on Mass Effect 3 and game director on Andromeda and the Legendary Edition compilation, <a href="https://wccftech.com/worlds-untold-qa-ex-mass-effect-writer-gets-netease-funding-to-make-a-sci-fi-action-adventure-game/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">founded</a> Worlds Untold last year with funding from NetEase. That's the problem: they have split with NetEase and are now seeking another partner. In the meantime, work on the project had to be stopped.</p>
<p><em>It’s hard to find the right words for this, but I wanted to share that we’ve made the very difficult decision to pause operations at Worlds Untold while we search for a new partner to help bring our vision to life. This was not a decision we made lightly—it’s been a deeply personal journey, and we’re all so proud of everything this team has built together. </em><em>In the meantime, our incredible team members will be exploring new opportunities.</em></p>
<p><em>This is a heartbreaking moment for everyone involved, but I’m deeply grateful for the support of our partners, friends and family, and for the time we’ve had together at Worlds Untold. While we’re pausing for now, this isn’t goodbye—there’s more to come, and we look forward to sharing the next chapter with you when the time is right.</em></p>
<p>We interviewed former Mass Effect writer and director Mac Walters last year as part of the news announcement, and we learned that the project would be more of an action/adventure title rather than an RPG, more story-driven and linear.</p>
<p><em>I've done RPGs and I love them, but I wanted to do something that led with story. It's an action RPG but with a lot of story and as much as we were always able to blend that into the RPG choose-your-own-adventure style, I really like the idea of telling something that's perhaps a little bit more linear. It looks at choice and consequence and things like that but in a different light.</em></p>
<p><em>I was also looking at some of the games that I had enjoyed recently, whether it was The Last of Us, Uncharted, or Tomb Raider that I get kind of get swept away in. I really wanted to focus on building a game that allowed me to tell a great adventure story.</em></p>
<p>We wish Walters and all the Worlds Untold team members involved the very best.</p>

            <p>I just played the neon bathroom graffiti on magic mushrooms stylings of<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-puzzle-games"> puzzle</a> game <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/children-of-the-sun">Children Of The Sun</a> for the first time last night, and it is very much my thing. It’s glowy! It’s violent! It’s thinky! You can <em>be</em> a <em>bullet, </em>and <em>then</em> you can be <em>another bullet</em>! Mental! (It’s technically the same bullet, but still!)</p>
<p>The basic idea is you take out stages of dudes, but you lose if you ever shoot without killing something. You move to where your bullet lands, so you have to plan routes through all the enemies, making sure one target is in view of the next. Also, you can steer the bullets if you want. Sometimes you can snipe a bird and feel the soaring freedom of a top down-view. Sometimes you snipe a fish and feel like a bastard. It’s great.</p>
<p>It’s also currently 40% off <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1309950/Children_of_the_Sun/">on Steam</a>, alongside a new horde mode update. Trailer below, and details below-erer.</p>

<p>“Take on entire platoons of THE CULT’s brainwashed minions, but watch out for a new enemy that can fire back,” reads <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1309950/view/4481739601737681384">the update</a>. “The sniper cultist has a bullet with your name on it, and will put a premature end to your quest for vengeance if you don’t find a way to deal with them”. I am literally just learning about this now. I’m only about eight levels in. Enemies that can fire back sound silly, in a good way.</p><p>“If you’re wondering how THE GIRL can take on an entire horde of cultists with only one bullet, well, now she can reload: by shooting herself,” it continues.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-has-sold-over-30-million-units-says-cdpr/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Yesterday, during their financial report for Q3 2024, CD Projekt RED announced that Cyberpunk 2077 has now surpassed 30 million units sold, while its expansion, Phantom Liberty, has sold 8 million in around a year.</p>
<p>Michał Nowakowski, Joint CEO of CDPR, said in a statement:</p>
<p><em>In less than four years since release, we’ve already sold 30 million copies of Cyberpunk 2077, and as for Phantom Liberty – in just over a year, it has sold over 8 million copies. These are impressive figures. I’m very happy to see a large, dedicated community coalesce around our Cyberpunk games. In the coming year, the base game, along with its expansion, will be released to a new group of users: owners of Mac devices powered by Apple Silicon chips.</em></p>
<p>Despite the controversial launch that featured many bugs and issues, especially on consoles, Cyberpunk 2077 was one of the most anticipated games of all time, following up on what was arguably the best game of the previous generation - The Witcher III: Wild Hunt. As such, even with all those caveats, it was the <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-is-the-biggest-digital-launch-ever-refunds-didnt-substantially-affect-aggregate-sales-says-superdata/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">biggest digital launch ever</a>, with an estimated 10.2 million units by January 2021. Sales probably slowed down for a while after that due to word of mouth and the fact that Sony outright removed the game from its PlayStation Store for several months.</p>
<p>However, CD Projekt RED's constant updates completely turned around the reception, culminating in the release of Update 2.0 and the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/cyberpunk-2077-phantom-liberty-shiny-firmware-update/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">excellent Phantom Liberty expansion</a>. All this work paid off, allowing what was already a rough diamond to properly shine. The sales are only the obvious consequence.</p>
<p>It wasn't just Cyberpunk 2077 that performed well for the Polish studio, as The Witcher 3 continues to sell even nine years after its launch. Overall, total revenue amounted to $55.7 million, while the company registered a consolidated net profit of $19 million.</p>
<p>The other big news of the day was, as already <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-4-is-officially-in-full-scale-production-game-director-is-confident-in-a-remarkable-experience/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported</a>, the announcement that The Witcher 4 (codenamed Project Polaris) is officially in full-scale production. On this, Nowakowski said:</p>
<p><em>I'm proud to confirm that several weeks ago the Polaris team wrapped up preproduction and moved on to full-scale production – the most intensive phase of development. We are very pleased with our progress on this project, and I wish to thank the team for its dedication.</em></p>
<p>As a reminder, Cyberpunk 2077 sequel Project Orion <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-sequel-project-orion-gets-high-profile-hires/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has its own North American-based team</a>, so work on that game continues separately. However, it's clear that most of CDPR's attention will be on the upcoming The Witcher game for the next few years.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/kai-cenat-beats-twitch-sub-record-%E2%80%93-but-he-had-to-hang-someone-along-the-way.1046229/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/kai-cenat-twitch-sub-record-hanging/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Kai Cenat has beaten his subscriber world record, racking up more than 580,000 concurrent Twitch subscribers during his Mafiathon 2 superstream. He has easily stormed past all previously set records, and since November 2, his channel has been live 24 hours a day. There’s no sign of the subathon slowing down.</p>



<p>Earlier today, the superstar streamer found himself in hot water following a bit on his broadcast that saw him and his friends ‘hang’ someone, prompting Kai to be concerned about getting banned from Twitch for what was later revealed to be a planned prank.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-did-kai-hang-someone">Did Kai Hang Someone?</h2>



<p>On social media, clips of the event are being circulated like wildfire, showing a topless man hanging from a high bar on Kai Cenat’s stream. A rope is pulled and the man, whose hands are bound, hangs for a few seconds, kicking his legs, until he’s brought down from the noose.</p>



<p>He’s then tended to by a medical team.</p>



<p>At first blush, Kai and his team seemed to be shocked and perplexed about the event. They’d strolled out into Kai’s garden not knowing what to expect, then they found a man willing to be hoisted <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2311951387?t=4h29m49s" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">up in a noose live on stream</a> – for clout and content, of course.</p>



<p>As a preface, it was revealed that the man being hung was Max Major, a YouTube ‘magician’ with a professional penchant for tricks like this. Later on, Kai shared a video, in which Major explained:</p>



<blockquote>
<p><em>What you don’t know is that was all according to my plan. See, at the start of my performance, I said that tonight was all about choices. But not just the choices that you made tonight, but the choices that you made since the day that we met. </em></p>



<p><em>Since the first time we met, you pushed me, you challenged me, and you wanted to see me fail. And I thought tonight, I’ll give you exactly what you asked for.</em></p>
</blockquote>



<p>By that point, Kai had already beaten his Twitch subscriber record, but the stunt was able to push him even further and put him in a high-ranking position on various social media platforms as a trending topic.</p>

That said, Advent Children's highly detailed CGI quality was lauded upon release, and even today, it stands as a testament to Square Enix's powerful tech--especially this 4K Blu-ray edition.</p>                      </div>                                                                     <div>             <h2>                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Final-Fantasy-Spirits-Within-Blu-ray/dp/B09G3FQX3B?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Final-Fantasy-Spirits-Within-Blu-ray\/dp\/B09G3FQX3B?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/Final-Fantasy-Spirits-Within-Blu-ray/dp/B09G3FQX3B?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20">Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within (4K Blu-ray)</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Final-Fantasy-Spirits-Within-Blu-ray/dp/B09G3FQX3B?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Final-Fantasy-Spirits-Within-Blu-ray\/dp\/B09G3FQX3B?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/Final-Fantasy-Spirits-Within-Blu-ray/dp/B09G3FQX3B?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20">$11.89 (was $31)</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <div><p>While Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within has a notorious reputation as a failure that cost Square Enix (at the time Squaresoft) millions of dollars and eventually led to Final Fantasy creator Hironobu Sakaguchi leaving the company, it's still worth checking out for die-hard Final Fantasy fans--especially when the 4K edition is on sale for this low--click the coupon box on the listing to get the full discount.</p><p>Final Fantasy: The Spirits Within looks and sounds unlike most other Final Fantasy properties, especially of the era, taking place on Earth in the distant future, and featuring a hard sci-fi plot with only the most tenuous ties to the rest of the franchise. Nevertheless, it deals with similar ideas as Sakaguchi's other work--namely the exploration of Gaia theory and ideas like life forces connecting living things--and it features surprisingly gorgeous CGI for the time.</p></div>                      </div>                                                                     <div>             <h2>                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Kingsglaive-Final-Fantasy-Blu-ray-Digital/dp/B08QRVLTCH?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Kingsglaive-Final-Fantasy-Blu-ray-Digital\/dp\/B08QRVLTCH?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/Kingsglaive-Final-Fantasy-Blu-ray-Digital/dp/B08QRVLTCH?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20">Kingsglaive: Final Fantasy XV (4K Blu-ray)</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Kingsglaive-Final-Fantasy-Blu-ray-Digital/dp/B08QRVLTCH?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Kingsglaive-Final-Fantasy-Blu-ray-Digital\/dp\/B08QRVLTCH?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/Kingsglaive-Final-Fantasy-Blu-ray-Digital/dp/B08QRVLTCH?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20">$13 (was $16)</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <p>Kingsglaive: Final Fantasy XV fleshes out the story of Final Fantasy XV, giving fans a look at events that were not shown in-game.

While he was executive producer on early games like C<em>rash Bandicoot: Warped</em> and <em>The Legend of Dragoon</em>, he later moved into leadership role across the business group, eventually becoming president of Sony Computer Entertainment Worldwide studios. </p><p>He told the PlayStation podcast that <em>Journey</em>’s release in 2012 on PS3 as a download-only indie hit that went on to win Game of the Year was a career highlight. “But that game…[won] Game of the Year against all these AAA titles, I think for the first time in the industry….the creator Jenova Chen did a talk at the summit, and he talked about a letter he received from a girl who lost her father and she thought about her father and she was able to move on in her life,” Yoshida said. “The whole audience stood up and the whole room was filled with happiness and an amazing feeling that this small game could have such a big impact on people’s lives.”</p><p>The executive was also well know for his own development experience and design sense. In one pivotal moment during <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ra_R-K_IoUc&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ra_R-K_IoUc" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the documentary about the making of 2018's <em>God of War</em></a></span>, Yoshida’s harsh criticism of an in-development build of the game becomes a make-or-break moment for the now-acclaimed reboot. He eventually stepped down from being the head of Worldwide studios in 2019, at which point then-Guerrilla Games studio head Hermen Hulst stepped into the role amid a reshuffling of PlayStation leadership. Hulst is now co-CEO of PlayStation alongside Hideaki Nishino.</p><p>Yoshida’s announcement marks the second major departure from PlayStation in under a year, after previous Sony Interactive Entertainment CEO Jim Ryan retired last spring. It will also leave the console maker without one of its most high-profile execs and visible faces in the community, with a long track record of popularity among fans. He’s perhaps best known for his part <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWSIFh8ICaA&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWSIFh8ICaA" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">in the infamous 22-second E3 2013 clip</a></span> demonstrating how games are shared on the PS4, a stunt that kicked off Sony’s current high-end console dominance. </p><p>“I’ve been with PlayStation from the beginning, and this is my 31st year with PlayStation,” he said. “And when I hit 30 years, I was thinking, hmm, it may be about time for me to move on. You know, the company’s been doing great. I love PS5, I love the games that are coming out on this platform. And we have new generations of management who I respect and admire. And I’m so excited for the future of PlayStation. So you know, PlayStation is in really good hands. I thought, okay, this is my time.”</p><p>Yoshida’s announcement comes on the eve of PlayStation’s 30th anniversary on December 3. In addition to the release of a retro line of PS5 consoles and accessories to celebrate, fans are also wondering if Sony might be teasing additional reveals or even a mini-showcase before the year is out. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>PlayStation veteran&nbsp;Shuhei Yoshida is leaving PlayStation in January. His retirement comes after more than 30 years with Sony, spending his time with PlayStation since its beginnings in 1993.</p>



<p>Yoshida, who made the announcement on the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/11/26/all-good-things-a-look-back-at-shuhei-yoshidas-31-years-with-playstation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">official PlayStation Blog</a>, is set to leave PlayStation on January 15, 2025.</p>



<p>“I’ve been with PlayStation from the beginning, and this is my 31st year with PlayStation,” he said. “And when I hit 30 years, I was thinking, hmm, it may be about time for me to move on.</p>



<p>“You know, the company’s been doing great. I love PS5, I love the games that are coming out on this platform. And we have new generations of management who I respect and admire. And I’m so excited for the future of PlayStation.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Yoshida has spent the last while as Head of Indies Initiative for Sony. Prior to that, he was President of SIE Worldwide Studis from 2008 to 2019.</p>



<p>While he’s been a part of large moments in PlayStation history, one may stand out to fans the most. In 2013, while Sony was unveiling the PlayStation 4 (PS4) at E3 2013, Sony took a jab at Microsoft’s disastrous Xbox One reveal earlier the same day. In short tutorial video, Yoshida and former Vice President of Publisher and Developer Relations Adam Boyes showed fans how they can share used games on the PS4.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>At the time of publishing, Sony hasn’t made any official announcement regarding who will take over for Yoshida as Head of Indies Initiative.</p>



<p>When making his decision to leave, Yoshida said that he believes PlayStation “is in really good hands” moving forward.</p>



<p>“I thought, okay, this is my time,” he said.</p>
