			<p>Today, Electronic Arts has released Respawn Entertainment's Star Wars Jedi: Survivor, the second game in the studio's franchise, on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. During EA's Investor Relations day, the publisher has also confirmed that Respawn is working on the third and final chapter of the trilogy. Laura Miele, president of EA Entertainment, said to investors:</p>
<p><em>We have delivered some of the highest quality and best-selling Star Wars games of all-time, with over $5 billion in net bookings. This impressive track record includes of course the Star Wars Jedi games, where over 40 million Star Wars fans have connected with Cal Kestis and his arc of becoming a powerful Jedi. Respawn is working hard to bring the final chapter of this thrilling story to players.</em></p>
<p>Unlike Jedi Fallen Order and Jedi Survivor, the next installment will have to be spearheaded by someone other than Stig Asmussen. The industry veteran, who is also credited for being the director of God of War III, <a href="https://wccftech.com/star-wars-jedi-director-stig-asmussen-leaves-respawn/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">left</a> Respawn a year ago. In March 2024, he <a href="https://wccftech.com/aaa-gaming-veterans-found-two-new-studios-called-giant-skull-and-emptyvessel/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">founded</a> Giant Skull, a new triple-A studio working on an action/adventure game powered by Unreal Engine 5.</p>
<p>Star Wars Jedi: Survivor got an 8.3/10 score <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/star-wars-jedi-survivor-cannot-change-the-past/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on Wccftech</a>:</p>
<p><em>While Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order was a surprise journey when it was first released, the time spent apart hasn’t made Cal Kestis’ adventures any less enjoyable. A similar framework in unfamiliar territories helps to establish Star Wars: Jedi: Survivor as a quality sequel to the original release. Jedi: Survivor still plays it safe in comparison to the prior game. It may be difficult to give it full marks for its individuality, but compared to the predecessor focused on Cal’s time as a Jedi Padawan, each title can stand up on its own merits, and Jedi: Survivor polishes up much of the experience as it propels the narrative ever forward on Cal Kestis’ journey to Tanalorr.</em></p>

<p>The game had many performance issues at launch, but Respawn kept working on it. The latest patch, <a href="https://wccftech.com/star-wars-jedi-survivor-patch-9-performance-improvements-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">released</a> a few days ago, <a href="https://wccftech.com/star-wars-jedi-survivor-update-9-didnt-resolve-stuttering-issues/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fixed </a>most (but not all) of the shortcomings.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://kotaku.com/life-is-strange-sale-xbox-remaster-true-colors-new-game-1851650596<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The <em>Life is Strange </em>series is a pretty odd one. At the time of the first game’s release, I wasn’t really aware that there was much interest in the goings-on of a bunch of teenagers in the Pacific Northwest. Boy, was I wrong, because nowadays <em>Life Is Strange </em>is a core franchise for Square Enix, comprising a number of sequels, spinoffs, and even comics that are, among other things, frequently diverse and transgressive in their subject matter. I appreciate the <em>Life Is Strange </em>series a lot, even if I sometimes feel like I’ve aged out of their young-adult trappings. Now—with a new game on the horizon and plenty of older games on sale—is the best time to catch up on the series before the latest installment in a little over a month.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196013" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Top 10 Most-Played Games On Steam Deck: October 2023 Edition" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="316" data-playlist="196013,195301,196345" data-current="196013"><div><p>The Top 10 Most-Played Games On Steam Deck: October 2023 Edition</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196013/196013_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196013/196013_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196013/196013_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196013/196013_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21533.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>The upcoming game, titled <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/life-is-strange-double-exposure-max-endings-chloe-1851538397&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/life-is-strange-double-exposure-max-endings-chloe-1851538397"><em>Life Is Strange: Double Exposure</em></a></span>, is pretty significant since it breaks from the series’ loosely established anthology framework. Characters have carried over between installments, and the games will often nudge (or sometimes shove) you into the direction of an easter egg or reference, but for the most part, every game has featured its own story and cast. <em>Double Exposure </em>defies that unspoken sentiment by once again featuring the first game’s protagonist, Max Caulfield. This time, Max is a young adult in her 20s, years after the events of the first <em>Life Is Strange</em>, but she is once again tasked with solving a murder. This time around, instead of rewinding time, Max now has the ability to shift into other timelines and realities, and tries to use this to save her friend, Safi, from ever being killed in the first place.<br></p><p>Given the fact that <em>Double Exposure </em>will be picking back up with Max, you probably owe it to yourself to see where her journey begins. <strong>The </strong><em><strong>Life Is Strange Remastered Collection </strong></em><strong>is currently going for $16 on Xbox and features remasters of both the original game and its spinoff prequel, </strong><em><strong>Before The Storm</strong></em><strong>. </strong>The main title plays from Max’s perspective, who returns to her hometown of Arcadia Bay in high school after some time away and reconnects with her childhood best friend, Chloe Price, who becomes the protagonist of the prequel. Along the way, they painfully stumble through stereotypical hurdles of teenagedom, including bullying, suicide, family tragedies, sexuality, and more. <em>Life Is Strange </em>is often hurt by its clunky attempts at trying to capture the language and thinking of teenagers of the era, but it gets by on its earnestness, sentimentality, and themes of nostalgia vs. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/you-really-should-be-playing-life-is-strange-1694516049&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/you-really-should-be-playing-life-is-strange-1694516049">living in the moment</a></span>.<br></p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/you-should-play-life-is-strange-2-1840213387&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/you-should-play-life-is-strange-2-1840213387"><em>Life Is Strange 2</em> is thought of as the dark horse of the pack</a></span>, so it should come as no surprise that it’s my favorite. Following Sean and Daniel, a pair of Latino brothers, it charts their journey across the American west coast as they flee from the law after a supernatural incident prompts a cop to shoot and kill their father. It’s a much rawer game than the first, having released a few years into Donald Trump’s presidency, and due to these factors, it unflinchingly deals with topics like <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/the-antagonist-in-life-is-strange-2-is-racism-1829555112&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/the-antagonist-in-life-is-strange-2-is-racism-1829555112">racism</a></span> and violence towards minorities. Sean, the older of the two brothers and the game’s protagonist, is <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/life-is-strange-2s-fourth-episode-puts-its-hero-through-1837516345&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/life-is-strange-2s-fourth-episode-puts-its-hero-through-1837516345">repeatedly battered</a></span> over the course of the game in a way that neither of the other game’s protagonists are, and by the end, this felt like a very pointed commentary on how the United States treats people who can’t possibly be white-passing.</p><p><em>Life Is Strange 2 </em>is also interesting because the playable character isn’t the one who has powers. Instead it’s Daniel, Sean’s younger brother, who manifests telekinetic powers, and as his only remaining role model, Sean’s moral choices don’t just affect him, but Daniel’s upbringing too. You can raise him to be a righteous person or someone willing to bend the rules with his newfound powers to get his way. David’s AI makes choices at points in the story that weigh the lessons Sean has passed off to him, which threatens to complicate their relationship further. It is one of the most distinctive social systems I’ve seen implemented into a game, occasionally shocking me with some of the results, and is a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/life-is-strange-2-is-a-heartbreakingly-accurate-brother-1840071123&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/life-is-strange-2-is-a-heartbreakingly-accurate-brother-1840071123">fascinating lens through which players can view a relationship</a></span> between brothers who belong to an entirely different culture than the assumed hegemony. </p><p><em>Life Is Strange 2 </em>doesn’t stick its landing, in my opinion, but its brazenness and ambition go a long way, and I’ve yet to see a game come even close to it in the intervening years. <strong>You can get the entirety of </strong><em><strong>Life Is Strange 2 </strong></em><strong> for just $6.39 on Xbox, and given that it’s currently Hispanic Heritage Month, consider it your responsibility to pick this game up.</strong><br></p><p>Finally, we have <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/life-is-strange-true-colors-the-kotaku-review-1847634961&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/life-is-strange-true-colors-the-kotaku-review-1847634961"><em>Life Is Strange: True Colors</em></a></span>. The latest installment in the series, <em>True Colors </em>follows <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/life-is-strange-true-colors-has-my-favorite-video-game-1848245259&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/life-is-strange-true-colors-has-my-favorite-video-game-1848245259">Alex Chen</a></span>, who moves to the idyllic and picturesque town of Haven Springs in Colorado to be reunited with her older brother Gabe. Here she tries to start a new life after bouncing around a lot as a teenager and never having any real stability. She befriends the locals and begins to fall in love with them and the town when her brother unceremoniously passes away. The rest of the game—which, in a break from form, was released altogether rather than episodically—has Alex and her friends investigate the town and the corporation whose tendrils can be felt everywhere, in an effort to divine who allowed Gabe to die. Alex has an upper hand in this case though, because she is an empath (no, a real one) capable of seeing the emotions of people around her and peeking into their minds. </p><p><em>True Colors </em>is robust and sound, but it’s also familiar and occasionally incurious, unlike the first two games. It is not without some gut punches, and one of its sequences contains some of the very best and most emotionally substantive work in the whole series, but more often than not, it just felt like a step back. For example, it felt way too in love with the idea of a place like Haven Springs, which seemed to blind the team from interrogating its politics more. The town isn’t perfect, but <em>True Colors</em> seems to think it’s pretty close, which is far removed from the lens that is held up to both Arcadia Bay in the original game, and the wider U.S in its sequel. It’s a little too cloying for my taste, but if comfort is a thing you come to games and this series for, <em>True Colors </em>has got you.<br></p><p><strong>For $18, you can vacation in Colorado with Alex Chen and her friends in <em>Life Is Strange: True Colors</em>. Alternatively, you can pay $21 to get the deluxe edition, which has a prequel episode following Steph, one of <em>True Colors’ </em>romanceable characters, or get the ultimate edition for $32, containing the aforementioned content <em>and </em>the <em>Life Is Strange Remastered Collection</em>.</strong></p><p>Fortunately, all of these games are pretty lean. Each episode of the first two games is less than or equal to a handful of hours on average, so you could easily spend a weekend on each one. Even <em>True Colors</em> is still structured episodically and can be completed in roughly the same amount of time, meaning that they’ll hardly overstay their welcome. Pick ‘em up now and dig into some particularly emotional stories ahead of <em>Double Exposure</em>’s release at the end of October.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Project T, the 1-4 player PvE co-op shooter from Midwinter Entertainment and Behaviour Interactive, has been cancelled. The <a href="https://x.com/Behaviour/status/1836103012575781262" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">announcement came via social media</a> on Tuesday from the studio.</p>



<p>According to Behaviour Interactive, results of a risk assessment after recent playtests “yielded unsatisfactory overall results”. This led to the decision to end development of the game immediately.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>“When we conceptualized this project, we wanted to have players involved in it as early as possible, which led to the creation of this Insider Program,” the studio said. </p>



<p>“This approach has allowed us to get very early validation on Project T’s core design and gameplay, which is something that often comes much further into the production of a game. Following the playtest in July, we ran a thorough internal risk assessment from a product and commercial perspective. While a number of you expressed appreciation for what you played, unfortunately, the outcome of this deep analysis yielded unsatisfactory overall results.”</p>



<p>They closed the statement by saying the decision was made with a heavy heart while thanking players for their support.</p>



<p>As far as what’s next for the studio and the developers working on the game, that is unknown. Nothing else regarding other projects within the company were mentioned with the announcement.</p>



<p>The last time players got a look at Project T <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/heres-a-first-look-at-dead-by-daylight-universe-game-project-t/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was back in May.</a> Since then, the news had been quite until the announcement of its cancellation.</p>



<p>What do you think of Project T being cancelled? Let us know in the comments below, and join the discussion in the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">official Insider Gaming Forums</a>.</p>

<p>The next new Battlefield Game isn’t just going to be an EA game made by DICE. Instead, there will be four different studios working on the next game.</p>



<p>EA held its Investor Day 2024 conference on Tuesday, and gave a bit more information on who will be developing the game, and in what fashion.</p>



<h6 id="h-read-more-skate-heads-to-early-access-in-2025">READ MORE: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/skate-heads-to-early-access-in-2025/">Skate Heads To Early Access In 2025</a></h6>



<p>According to the company, DICE will focus on the game’s multiplayer online. Motive, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/motive-studios-battlefield/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">which was announced to be moving</a> to Battlefield earlier this year, will work on the game’s single player offering. Criterion Games, which worked on Battlefield V and 2024 as well as the Need For Speed franchise, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/criterion-battlefield-ea-help/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">is working on both</a> single player and multiplayer. Lastly, Ripple Effect is working on a “new experience” that will be announced in the future.</p>



<p>Recently, EA <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-modern-era/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmed</a> an <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-2025-battle-royale/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">earlier Insider Gaming exclusive</a> regarding features for the next Battlefield game. The game will feature a return to 64-player maps, a classed-based system, and will release sometime in 2025. Insider Gaming has also learned that the next Battlefield game will have a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-2025-battle-royale/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">free-to-play Battle Royale mode</a>. It’s unclear if that’s the “new experience” Ripple Effect is working on.</p>



<p>More information on the game will be unveiled at a later date, including a first look at gameplay, modes, a release date, and more.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Frostpunk 2 Is So Much Bigger Than A Sequel]]></title>
            <link>https://aftermath.site/frostpunk-2-impressions</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/frostpunk-2-is-so-much-bigger-than-a-sequel.983649/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/frostpunk-2-impressions<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I’m just starting Chapter 3 of <em>Frostpunk 2</em>’s story mode, but I already want to start the whole game over. It’s the curse of city-builders, or at least when I play them: learning more as you go and realizing how much better things could be if only you’d done something different further back, realizing the ways you’ve hamstrung your little civilization by building on shoddy foundations. But I’m too attached to my version of New London–all its demanding people, and its struggling satellite towns, and the direction my whole society is moving in– to turn back now.</p><p><em>Frostpunk 2</em> comes out Friday for PC, and<a href="https://x.com/stephentotilo/status/1835831410138996963" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> later</a> for consoles, but people who preordered can play it today. It’s a sequel to 11 bit studio’s 2018 <a href="https://kotaku.com/you-should-be-playing-the-brutal-city-builder-frostpunk-1825656934" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wintery, steampunk city-builder</a>, where you created a circular city around a vital, heat-giving generator, and then dealt with all your tiny citizens being pissed off at everything you did afterwards. The sequel does away with the circle and the clustered city, leaning into a hex-based sprawl that extends into the iced-over wastelands outside your city too.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Frostpunk 2 | Official Gameplay Trailer" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PWlLOpqIYjA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>While I miss the spatial constraints of the first game, I appreciate what <em>Frostpunk 2</em> is doing with its new shape. It feels like it wants to be a <em>bigger </em>game in every way, asking you to think about civilization as a whole. In terms of city planning, you first have to “frostbreak” a required number of hexes before you can build on them, and then instead of constructing buildings you construct entire districts. These districts have specific functions: extracting necessary items like materials, food, coal, or oil; industrial areas that can produce goods, needed to keep people happy and crime down, or prefabs, which are required for building; housing for your rapidly growing population; or logistics areas that create scouts to explore the snowy frostlands beyond. I found frostbreaking a little annoying, feeling like an extra step and cost, but it embodies the vibe of <em>effort</em> that defines the game. The snow isn’t just for aesthetics here; <em>of course</em> you’d have to break the ice before you could build.</p><p>This grander physical scale also means a more zoomed-out, complicated experience. Time moves in weeks instead of days, and districts require huge amounts of workers to function, requiring massive populations that come with the downside of requiring more resources. Things feel less intimate than in the first game, and while individual citizens still pop up with stories to tell and requests to make, I found myself thinking about them more as numbers, like any other resource. Instead of managing a little city, you’re managing an entire civilization, and the unique people within it started to fade into the back of my brain in favor of focusing on my need for more space and more resources.</p><figure><figcaption>An overlay of the different districts. (11 bit studios)</figcaption></figure><p>Your local resources will eventually run out, requiring expanding into the outlying areas, setting up new mini-civilizations and connecting them to your main city via trails or higher-capacity skyways. In the story mode’s prologue, you have to get a generator in an old train up and running; later in the story, you return to create a colony that can extract oil to send back to your main city of New London. I did<em> terribly</em> by these isolated, necessary colonists, putting them on extra shifts pumping oil and then shipping all of it away to heat my main city and provide resources for other outposts or settlements. (There are three different names for the outlying areas you can set up; suffice it to say they have different levels of management required, and are differently affected by weather events.) When workers died during emergency shifts, I just sent more workers, creating housing and food shortages. At one point, a group of nomads demanded the colony stockpile oil for them, but I just kept sending that oil away because the city needed it more, leading to a slaughter that at least solved my resource shortages. When a whiteout weather event set in, interrupting the flow of resources and creating a crisis in New London, I basically abandoned the little oil colony completely to focus on the city. I returned to just a handful of survivors, and am now faced with getting the whole thing back up and running on top of my guilt.</p><p>In one way, I really like this mechanic: juggling so many moving pieces and competing needs, zooming in and out to make sure my whole system is working. In another way, it felt a little busy at times. I had to fiddle with a lot of moving resources around to supply or upgrade areas: my oil colony had its own economy, but to get needed oil to my food-producing settlement, I had to send it from the colony to the city first, and this is just one minor example of all the resource moving and balancing and stockpiling the game requires. It all feels engagingly hands-on, but also a little bit complicated for the sake of being complicated. Whether this is a good or bad thing is down to your personal tastes, but I admire that the sequel is more than just a rehash. It stays true to the original’s focus on balancing competing demands, but expands that out into every aspect of the game in a way that gives you both more demands to balance and more control over how you do so.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>There is, of course, still a focus on people, one of the notable qualities of the first game. Here, there’s a whole council to wrangle with, full of communities and factions with their own worldviews, goals, and opinions on your leadership. You’ll need to get enough of them on your side to pass the laws you want to pass and shape your city to your whims. Early on, my delinquent youth were causing crime; my options were to institute mandatory schooling, supported by the forward-thinking Evolvers faction, or mandatory apprenticeships, supported by the traditionalist Faithkeeper faction. Each of these groups had their minds made up, which left my two communities, the New Londoners and Frostlanders, somewhere in the middle. (As with the outlying areas above, there are different kinds of groups of people: factions arise from communities and have more opinions, and will hold rallies or take aggressive actions on their own.) To sway those undecided delegates to my choice, I could promise them things: offering to build the Frostlanders a survivalist headquarters (makes them happy; decreases my exploration time), or pass a law about machine-centric work shifts that would please the New Londoners (making districts require less workers; increasing squalor and thus wear on my districts). Or, I could avoid negotiating altogether by just holding the vote and seeing how things panned out.</p><figure><figcaption>The council chambers (11 bit studios)</figcaption></figure><p>The council feature’s bigger, more complicated take on the first game’s moral choices is a lot of fun, asking you to balance your goals with the demands of different groups of people and do a certain bit of manipulating to get what you want. You can fail your promises, accidentally or on purpose, turning groups against you and sowing distrust, too much of which will end your game. You can also micromanage these relationships a great deal, giving or taking money from groups, letting them choose what laws you vote on, or letting them take special actions. Factions and communities give your civilization a grand, messy personality that I felt like part of more than its commander; when I started, I wanted to side with the Faithkeepers, but the city kept going in the direction of the Evolvers because they kept bringing me useful demands and innovations. Where I sometimes didn’t love how many new pieces the expanded city-building has, I was delighted by all of the politicking and voting and micromanaging of the human side of things, down to the lovely council chambers graphic and all its mumbling, cheering members.&nbsp;</p><p>You’ll notice all the little distinctions and explanations I bracketed out above, like the differences between factions and communities, or outposts, settlements, and colonies. <em>Frostpunk 2</em>’s bigger scale introduces what I found to be sometimes too much complexity, especially in my first time through the game. There’s a hefty text tutorial that, while helpful as a constant reference, didn’t always feel like it was introduced to me at the right time. I should be very clear that some of this is surely down to my own lifelong struggle to be patient during tutorials, and that the onboarding might have changed by the game’s final release. You’ll also benefit from guides and videos; in a couple instances where I watched people’s playthroughs of the game’s open beta, things were much easier for me to understand when I saw them in action. Some of my confusion might also be down to the game’s new perspective: a bigger city and more things to manage makes it easier to lose track of certain specifics, and while the game does a good job of using icons to show you where something’s gone wrong, it can take a bit of poking in tooltips and submenus to understand exactly why, and sometimes tweaks to your whole system to fix. Combined with a whole new lexicon and every building action’s various resource requirements (I haven’t even touched on the money-like heatstamps and how you get them, or the findable cores required for certain upgrades, or the research tree), <em>Frostpunk 2</em> has <em>a lot</em> going on. Sometimes this felt like it made my experience better, but other times it felt like it just made my experience <em>more</em>.</p><figure><figcaption>A tooltip showing the resources of a certain kind of hub, which gives a glimpse of the things you'll juggle in the game. (11 bit studios)</figcaption></figure><p>While the story mode’s fail states don’t make it a great learning environment in some ways, it does help you figure out how to deal with and prioritize the things you’ll face in its open game mode. Moments of feeling frustrated or overwhelmed were balanced by learning more about why the game’s many pieces mattered as I clumsily banged them together and saw what the outcomes were. The more I played, the more I could see the possibilities behind the things that confused or overwhelmed me on their first introduction. Like many city-builders, and like the first game, it feels like one where you’ll want to embrace failure as a learning experience, and where mastering what it’s doing will give you a ton of control to experiment and roleplay. I’m excited to improve at it, and to learn from and be inspired by what other players do. I am bravely resisting the urge to nuke my starter city because I’m not the player–or city leader–I was when I started; this sense of growing control feels like I’m improving as a leader alongside my civilization’s improvements.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Frostpunk 2</em> isn’t just more <em>Frostpunk</em>, something I would have been happy with. It’s bigger and more complicated and more demanding and more personalizable in every aspect, all while staying true to the heart and ethos of the first game. That’s no small feat, and it’s exciting to see in a sequel. It's a game that knows what it wants to talk about and what it wants you to play with. Even when I felt like I had way too much to do, the way any beleaguered city leader might, I was excited to come back for more.&nbsp;</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

This looks good.” That isn’t an understatement, as the art behind this delightful, multi-dimensional <em>Zelda</em>-like sure is gorgeous and nostalgic. Developer All Possible Futures clearly put a lot of time and effort into creating a stunning aesthetic for their game, which releases on September 17 and has players jumping between 2D and 3D environments as a—you guessed it—plucky squire.<br></p><p><strong>Pre-order <em>The Plucky Squire:</em></strong><em> </em><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://humblebundleinc.sjv.io/c/379647/2059850/25796?subId1=KT-&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.humblebundle.com%2Fstore%2Fthe-plucky-squire%3Fhmb_source%3Dsearch_bar&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://humblebundleinc.sjv.io/c/379647/2059850/25796?subId1=KT-&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.humblebundle.com%2Fstore%2Fthe-plucky-squire%3Fhmb_source%3Dsearch_bar" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Humble Bundle</a></span> </p><p>The 2D environments are the most dazzling to behold, as they embrace the storybook world in which most of the game’s characters live. This half of the game’s visual style is defined by an impeccable use of color and simple yet evocative bold lines enveloping every item on the page.<br></p><p>That isn’t to say the 3D world in which protagonist Jot gets jettisoned into early on in <em>The Plucky Squire </em>isn’t equally as impressive, it’s just not what you expect when you start up the game. Yet once you and Jot both get into the world outside of the storybook, the effortless translation of 2D designs to 3D speaks to just how well crafted every piece of this delightful adventure is.<br></p><p>In the final version of <em>The Plucky Squire</em>, all of this varied artistic splendor seems natural, effortless even.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/logitech-g%E2%80%99s-new-pro-series-accessories-will-excite-esports-players.983631/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/logitech-esports-pro-series-accessories/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Logitech has just revealed the next generation of Pro Series mice and keyboards during Logi Play 2024, a tech showcase highlighting the future of Logitech G. Marketed towards ‘elite esports athletes’, the new Pro Series accessories are set to turn heads after being designed hand-in-hand with professional gamers and esports experts alike.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-competitive-lineup">Competitive Lineup</h2>



<p>Logitech has revealed three core components to the Pro Series range at Logi Play 2024:</p>



<ul>
<li>Pro 2 Lightspeed Wireless Mouse (RRP $129.99)</li>



<li>Pro X Superlight 2 DEX (RRP $159.99)</li>



<li>Pro X TKL Rapid Keyboard (RRP $169.99)</li>
</ul>



<p>The Pro X Superlight 2 DEX is a brand-new, asymmetrical mouse that boasts a right-handed design. It has been assembled with help from Counter-Strike and Valorant pro players, and with it being light, wireless, and responsive, it’s a solid choice for esports gamers. </p>



<p>G2 Esports’ NiKo spoke about this new mouse:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>The PRO X SUPERLIGHT 2 DEX feels like an extension of my hand, and that kind of comfort is crucial in high-stakes matches. DEX delivers on the quality, precision, and speed that I told Logitech I need to win.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Elsewhere, the Logitech Pro 2 Lightspeed Wireless mouse offers an ambidextrous build that takes the original model to the next level. This new build was praised by FlyQuest RED’s ‘evv’:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>If you are a fan of ambidextrous mice, the G PRO 2 LIGHTSPEED is definitely the one I recommend! It’s such a fast and<br>responsive mouse, and its shape is effortless to hold, which makes adjusting to your targets more precise and simple.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The gem of the bundle has to be the Pro X TKL Rapid keyboard, though. This is Logitech’s entry into the magnetic analogue market, and it features adjustable actuation and rapid trigger functionality as standard. That means players can tweak the keys to their liking – without software. That’s a <strong>huge </strong>win for esports players.</p>



<p>In a statement, G2 Esports’ m0NESY, one of the best Counter-Strike players in the world, said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I’ve tested many analogue keyboards out there, but what sets the PRO X TKL RAPID apart is how Logitech truly listened to my input. They took the time to understand what I needed in a keyboard and made sure those features were reflected in the final product.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In terms of release dates, both the Pro 2 Lightspeed and the Pro X Superlight 2 DEX are available now, while the Pro X TKL Rapid keyboard will be released in December. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-mandating-3-days-in-office-for-all-employees/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Ubisoft has announced to all of its employees a new in-office mandate requiring staff be in office at least three days a week. The announcement came via a company-wide email from from chief studios and portfolio officer  Marie-Sophie de Waubert.</p>



<p>Per <a href="https://venturebeat.com/games/ubisoft-will-return-to-3-days-a-week-in-office/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">VentureBeat</a>, who received a copy of the email, the company is requiring the three days in office in order to “enhance creativity and teamwork.”</p>



<p>Ubisoft says that a third of the global staff already work three days in office. This policy now makes it a company-wide mandate. Of course, there will be some exceptions depending on where the employees live as well as whether people will be forced to move closer to an office during a time when housing prices continue to be higher than at any point in history.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-ubisoft-said-to-employees">What Ubisoft Said To Employees</h2>



<p>“We are a creative company, and creativity is boosted by in-person interactions, informal conversations, and collaborating around the same table,” de Waubert said in her email to Ubisoft’s employees. “Being together in person also helps&nbsp;solve problems and make decisions more effectively.&nbsp;Increasing in-person time is key to learn from each other in an industry that’s constantly evolving. And this is even more important for newcomers who need to master our tools and understand our ways of doing things.”</p>



<p>Though there is a return to three days in office, Ubisoft says that it will not be going back to a full five-day week. VentureBeat does mention that companies like Amazon, Dell, AT&amp;T, and others have all forced employees back into the office in recent months.</p>



<p>There is no set date for when the mandate will go into effect.</p>

<p>EA has confirmed that The Sims 5 isn’t coming after all. In a post on their official website alongside an interview with Variety, it was confirmed that EA will instead focus on The Sims 4 moving forward rather than release a brand new game.</p>



<p>“The Sims&nbsp;will move beyond linear, sequential&nbsp;Sims&nbsp;releases and offer more options for players than ever before,” the company said <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/the-sims/news/the-future-of-the-sims" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">via their website</a>.</p>



<p>To clarify on the decision, EA vice president and The Sims general manager Kate Gorman <a href="https://variety.com/2024/gaming/news/the-sims-5-update-multiplayer-creator-content-ea-interview-1236142010/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">said to Variety</a>, “The way to think about it is, historically, ‘The Sims’ franchise started with ‘Sims 1’ and then ‘Sims 2,’ ‘3’ and ‘4.’ And they were seen as replacements for the previous products.</p>



<p>“What we’re really working with our community on is this a new era of ‘The Sims.’ We are not going to be working on replacements of previous projects; we’re only going to be adding to our universe.”</p>



<h2 id="h-the-future-of-the-sims-from-ea">The Future Of The Sims From EA</h2>



<p>Moving forward, EA will treat The Sims as a universal franchise across multiple platforms in the form of different product, including games and movies.</p>



<p>When asked for further clarification on the state of the franchise, Gorman added: “What this means is that we will continue to bring HD simulation experience and what people would want from a ‘5’ — but it doesn’t mean that we’re going to start you over, reset all your progress, and really feel like you’re going to lose all of that amazing play you put into ‘4′.”</p>



<p>Future updates on the game will continue to come “regularly every two months until further notice”. The next known update is coming this week to The Sims 4 that will include fixes and a base game update. Full patch notes on it will be available when the release drop. </p>



<p>There will also be more expansions to the game for players that add to the game.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Frostpunk 2 Review]]></title>
            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/frostpunk-2-review</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/frostpunk-2-review.983562/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/frostpunk-2-review<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Most sequels to successful games are safe, conservative iterations on the ideas of the original, but not here: Frostpunk 2 is a bold follow-up that takes an almost entirely different approach to its city-building strategy. It’s set in the same bleak, iced-over world where people struggle to survive, but it’s refreshing that we’re not retreading the same frozen ground. Everything from how you place buildings to how you manage resources and heat your city is a new spin, and its political system is a creative way to interact with the people of New London that does a great job of conveying a sense of <em>quid-pro-quo</em> negotiation in a representative democracy. The zoomed-out perspective does mean that we lose a lot of the feeling of intimacy that made the first game truly stand out, but there’s no shortage of morally questionable decisions to make as you’re building your society. </p><p>A frosty atmosphere is strong, thanks to bone-chilling weather effects and dramatic music that swells as tension in your city increases. Coming from a replay of the first Frostpunk, I was initially missing the ability to see people walking in the streets. That said, they do pop up with comments on your actions and an announcer on the loudspeaker gives occasionally amusing remarks on current events, so it doesn’t feel like a ghost town. The map itself is obviously fairly uniform because it’s covered in white snow and ice, but there are features like mountains and cliffs to give each area its own look, and as you build it becomes much more colorful thanks to intricate districts and the automatically created power lines which pulse red when tension runs high.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Frostpunk 2 Review Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>The five-chapter Story mode serves as something of a tutorial for the sandbox Utopia Builder mode, though aside from a few short cutscenes there isn’t a whole lot of plot driving it. There’s little here beyond a direct bridge between the events of the first game and this one as you take over the city of New London, with the vast majority of story coming in brief, affecting vignettes about life in the frozen wastes. There’s a lot to cover as you learn to place and expand multi-tile districts for housing, food production, resource/fuel extraction, industry, and logistics, each with its own set of upgrade buildings, plus single-tile hub buildings with adjacency bonuses. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>It’s an interesting city-building puzzle with a couple of questionable quirks.</p></div><p>It’s an interesting city-building puzzle with a couple of questionable quirks: The frostbreaking system, which requires you to first clear out batches of tiles before you can build on them, makes sense in the fiction but feels like busywork that just slows down how quickly you can act on a plan. It’s also frustrating that you can’t reposition any single tile without demolishing the entire district and starting over, but at least you get all of your resources back so all it costs you is time.</p><p>When you zoom out to the vast and even more barren Frostlands map, the main features are the very Game of Thrones-inspired clockwork icons for your colony and outposts. Your scouts discover these as you send them on dispatch missions to explore and bring home many of the resources and population you’ll need to keep your colony going. It’s much more built out than the original’s version of the Frostlands, in that you must connect the resources you find there with roads to bring back a steady stream of them, then found and upgrade more outposts and even full satellite colonies to keep New London going. It’s very much a side activity, but the rewards there are so crucial to building your population that I was motivated to check it frequently and keep the resources coming. </p><p>The main thing that bothered me here is that you can’t see your factions at the bottom of the screen when you’re not in your main city, so if things start going wrong as you’re off building your resource operation it can get out of hand before you notice. I’d also have loved to be able to zoom out further, since the Frostland maps can get huge and scanning for where my scouts just finished a mission takes too long.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>You can’t just produce enough to keep the lights on – you need to overproduce as hard as you can.</p></div><p>The challenge of feeding your colonies’ central generator’s need for fuel and keeping the city supplied with heat, food, and materials is fairly conventional and straightforward for supply chain games, though in a few major ways it does become more complicated at times. For one thing, massive Whiteout storms hit every so often and shut down the entire Frostlands map, disrupting supply chains and leaving you to subsist on your stockpiles for months at a time. That means you can’t just produce enough to keep the lights on – you need to overproduce as hard as you can to avoid having your people freeze to death by the hundreds.</p><p>Speaking of freezing, I did hit a couple of bugs with the interface, such as where I had to click on certain dialogue choices a bunch of times before they’d register. Sometimes the buttons on the UI would overlap and clicking it would register on the button underneath instead of the one that was more visible on top. It’s also a little annoying that it locks up for several seconds during an autosave, but there was nothing severe. It's worth noting though, that – as with most games of this type – the higher your population goes, the more performance is prone to decline.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The centerpieces of Frostpunk 2 are its faction and government systems.</p></div><p>Arguably the centerpieces of Frostpunk 2, though, are its faction and government systems. This is where you must strike a balance between opposing groups of citizens by keeping promises around how they’d like to see you run the place. You don’t lose by having your colony wiped out (it would be quite a challenge to get the population down to zero) – instead, you have to worry about your people losing trust in you or the tension level rising to the point where they boot you out of office. It’s all too easy for a shortage of any of the resources to send you into a downward spiral where everybody’s mad at everybody else and society collapses. </p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><p><h3>Dan's Favorite Building Games</h3></p></div><p>My first time through I made the rookie mistake of assuming I could blow off one faction entirely if I kept the others happy, and at first it seemed to work. You can research whatever technologies you like with the push of a button (and a small fee) but passing laws – often needed to actually enact what you’ve unlocked through research – can only be done through the Council, which is made of 100 representatives of your city’s factions. Frostpunk 2 has a fun way of displaying the votes, where members’ seats light up as they cast theirs, and any vote you don’t lock down in advance is a roll of the dice. Bribing – or rather persuading – a faction to vote your way is a matter of making promises to do something on their behalf. Most of the time they want you to research a specific tech or pass a law that aligns with that faction’s worldview, but sometimes they’ll take cold, hard cash (ironically called heatstamps). Even so, factions won’t negotiate at all if a proposal is against their worldview, so some votes are still nailbiters.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>My first time through I made the rookie mistake of assuming I could blow off one faction entirely.</p></div><p>I had a lot of fun with the fact that, if you play your cards right, you can often be rewarded for doing what you’re planning on doing anyway. The interface helpfully tells you which version of each research item (most have different options that might, for instance, cost less to build and boost production but pollute more or create tension) is supported by which faction. Armed with that information, you can go to them and see if they’ll ask you for it, and if they do you’ll build extra trust when you research it. Similarly, it’s always hilarious to promise a bothersome faction they get to choose the next law that’ll be voted on in order to get their relationship bar out of the red, only to then whip votes against it and see them get nothing out of it.</p><p>So I could usually pass any law I wanted with a supermajority of support, ignoring the extremists who were upset when I pushed through policies like Free Essentials to feed the people or Accept All Outsiders to boost my population, whether they could work or not (hitting population numbers is one of the main goals). However, there’s a catch: until you unlock some of the heavier-handed and authoritarian policies, that approach leaves you vulnerable to protests that shut down production in your districts, injure bystanders and destroy equipment, and of course raise tension through the roof. That means you’ll have to come back to the table and negotiate, which can be difficult to do while riots are slowing everything to a crawl. You do get more tools to deal with dissenters as you go, up to and including rounding them up and leaving them to freeze to death in outdoor prisons (I eventually won the story campaign by finally deporting the troublemaking faction to their own colony) but many of those cause tension to rise and trust to fall when used. There’s no easy answer, which makes it a compelling problem to solve. </p><p>My first run of the Story mode took about 15 hours, including a restart when I figured out exactly how bad my initial decisions had been. I’ve since put in another 20 in the Utopia Builder sandbox mode with objectives like founding multiple colonies with 10,000 residents or building tall with 50,000 in your home base, and there’s a promising amount of replay potential in Frostpunk 2. Not only are there six major factions (and their radicalized offshoots) to mix and match – and seven different Frostlands maps to play on – but there are different paths you can take by leaning into different philosophies that unlock different radical ideas. Doing a run on a higher difficulty than Officer – the one recommended for Frostpunk veterans – would certainly require spending more time getting to know the factions’ preferences than I did on my first successful run to avoid angering them unnecessarily. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>There’s a promising amount of replay potential in Frostpunk 2.</p></div><p>I can’t help but feel that we’ve lost something important, though, in expanding from the small-scale perspective of the first game to a multi-colony big picture – one where you can only see your people when you hit a button to do a close-up to observe a handful of them milling around. For instance, seeing a message pop up that 93 children died in a mine collapse doesn’t really hit the same when it soon vanishes without obvious repercussions. It was a lot easier for me to think of those kids as just stats on a spreadsheet when they never even had names that I can view in the graveyard, like I could in Frostpunk. Frostpunk 2 is just too big for that.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>The Best PC Games</h3></div></output><p>“Back up a second,” you might say. “What were 93 children doing in a mine in the first place?” Well I’m glad you asked. In one of my smarter decisions as Steward of New London – one that was enabled by my choice to go with an apprenticeship system instead of mandatory schooling for children because it increased my workforce – I opted to send them in to gather coal that was inaccessible to full-grown adults. The other option was to blast the way clear, but that would’ve given me less coal. No one could’ve foreseen anything going wrong with that plan!</p><p>Forstpunk 2 is always throwing decisions like that at you and then serving up consequences, often making me feel a little dirty for picking the one that gave me the boost the spreadsheet said I needed despite the human cost. So while it might not land the punches as effectively, it certainly takes a lot of swings, and those add up.
