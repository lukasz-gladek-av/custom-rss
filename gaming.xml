            <link>https://kotaku.com/budget-friendly-mac-mini-alternative-this-windows-11-pro-mini-pc-selling-for-peanuts-at-amazon-2000640954</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/budget-friendly-mac-mini-alternative-this-windows-11-pro-mini-pc-selling-for-peanuts-at-amazon.1342801/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Apple’s Mac Mini is a small powerhouse of performance but it starts at $599 for the base model, which makes it inaccessible to budget-conscious buyers who only need a dependable desktop computer. If your needs are centered around web browsing, document work, streaming and basic productivity tasks, you really don’t need premium engineering from Apple.</p>
<p>A strong value alternative is the <em>Acemagic Mini PC 11 Pro</em> (16GB DDR4 256GB SSD, Intel N95) which comes in at about one-third of the cost,<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5318/"> falling from $239 down to $189 on Amazon, with another 10% off coupon that drops your out-the-door price even further</a>. This Windows 11 Pro machine won’t match the Mac Mini’s raw performance but it provides enough power for everyday computing.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5318/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Compact Design That Disappears into Your Setup</h2>
<p>It measures <strong>just 3.9 inches square and 1.3 inches tall</strong>&nbsp;so it’s smaller than most hardcover books and easy to tuck behind monitors, on cramped desks, or in entertainment centers. An included VESA mounting bracket lets you attach this mini PC to the back of your monitor, essentially turning any display into an all-in-one computer setup that will save desk space and eliminate cable clutter. Also, a 2,300 RPM high-speed silent axial fan<strong> keeps the processor cool without generating the annoying whirring noise</strong> that makes cheaper compact PCs sound like miniature jet engines during intensive tasks.</p>



<p>The processor under the hood is an<strong> Intel Alder Lake N95 and clocks up to 3.4GHz on its four cores and four threads</strong> for 45% better performance compared to the N100 and N150 chips found in other budget mini PCs. It’s a quad-core setup that easily handles multiple opened browser tabs, Office applications, and video streaming without the stuttering and lag that makes you want to throw budget computers out the window.</p>
<p>Memory and storage strike a great balance for general computing needs: The 16GB of DDR4 RAM keeps multiple applications running smoothly without slow downs when rapidly switching between programs, checking email, streaming music, and working on documents all at once. The <strong>256GB SSD loads Windows and applications in mere seconds</strong> rather than the painful minutes you’d be stuck with on traditional hard drives and can be easily upgraded to a larger M.2 NVMe or SATA SSD up to 2TB if you need space for photos, videos, or games.</p>



<p><strong>Support for two 4K displays via HDMI 2.0 and DisplayPort 1.4</strong> lets you connect two monitors for expanded workspace to transform your productivity by letting you view reference materials on one screen while you work on the other. The integrated UHD Graphics runs at up to 1.2GHz to handle everyday visuals and 4K video playback with ease.</p>
<p>Connectivity options include everything from modern to legacy: <strong>two USB 3.2 Gen2 ports</strong> for fast data transfer, <strong>two USB 2.0 ports</strong> that can be used for keyboards and mice, and even a<strong> Gigabit Ethernet port</strong> that can reach speeds of as much as 1000Mbps for stable wired internet connectivity. The 3.5mm audio jack supports virtually any set of headphones or external speakers, and the power button is placed in an easily accessible location, not hidden where one has to fumble around blindly.</p>
<p>In the package<strong>, you’ll get Windows 11 Pro</strong>&nbsp;which includes business features like BitLocker encryption, Remote Desktop, and domain joining, among many others, that the home versions don’t have. The hardware is supported with a one-year limited warranty against defects in design and workmanship and support from the Acemagic team if you hit a problem.</p>
<p>For less than $190, thanks to the coupon, this is a workable Windows desktop that will handle everyday computing tasks without breaking the bank.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ea-says-it-will-retain-creative-control-following-saudi-sale-but-like-come-on.1342798/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Today, as part of <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/712515/000114036125039888/ef20057994_defa14a.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">an updated FAQ</a> aimed at workers (<a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/ea-creative-control-sale-saudi-arabia-silverlake-affinity-partners" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">spotted by Game File</a>), EA said that its <a href="https://aftermath.site/the-ea-sale-is-bad-news-for-everyone" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">impending $55 billion sale</a> to a consortium that includes Saudi Arabia’s Public Investment Fund will not come at the cost of creative control. If you take EA at its word, I have a bridge to sell you.&nbsp;</p><p>The FAQ includes a number of tersely worded sentiments intended to reassure.&nbsp;</p><p>"We will continue to be guided by our cultural values of creativity, pioneering, passion, determination, learning, and teamwork," it says to counter concerns around a change in culture. "EA will maintain creative control and our track record of creative freedom and player-first values will remain intact."&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Another eyebrow raiser: no layoffs following a major acquisition. From a company that already <a href="https://aftermath.site/electronic-arts-respawn-titanfall-layoffs-andrew-wilson-pay" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">laid off hundreds of employees</a> <a href="https://aftermath.site/ea-black-panther-canceled-layoffs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">across multiple rounds</a> earlier this year in the name of “<a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/ea-says-business-primed-for-accelerated-growth-following-layoffs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">accelerated growth</a>.” Following a buyout that will <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/-gaming-is-the-new-oil-how-the-ea-buyout-diverges-from-the-traditional-playbook-" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">saddle the company with $20 billion in debt</a>. Sure!</p><p>"There will be no immediate changes to your job, team, or daily work, as a result of this transaction," reads the response to a question about layoffs. "Our focus is on driving innovation, and expanding our global reach, all of which require world class teams, who are excited to shape the future of entertainment."</p><p>The driving message underlying the FAQ is more of the same – literally, with EA saying that management, HQ, AI usage, and other staples will remain exactly as they are now.&nbsp;</p><p>That would be great if big companies had given us any reason to believe them in circumstances like this, ever. Bungie leadership told employees that Sony’s purchase of the studio <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/video-games/2022/02/01/bungie-sony-buyout-destiny-2-developers/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wouldn’t result in layoffs or restructuring</a> back in 2022. Look at Bungie now: It’s <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/destiny-developer-bungie-cuts-220-staff-some-of-the-most-difficult-changes-weve-ever-had-to-make-as-a-studio" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a husk of itself</a>, dragging new <em>Destiny </em>expansions across the finish line while betting big on <em>Marathon</em>, a game whose lunch may have just been preemptively devoured by <em>Arc Raiders</em>.&nbsp;</p><p>Or consider everything Microsoft said in its attempts to avert the regulatory Eye Of Sauron while its purchase of Activision Blizzard was still pending. The deal will be <a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2022/06/02/employee-organizing-engagement-labor-economy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">super worker-friendly</a>? <a href="https://aftermath.site/xbox-layoffs-july" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Uhhh</a>. Game Pass prices <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/microsoft-wins-against-ftc-injunction-against-activision-blizzard-buyout-is-denied/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">won’t skyrocket</a>? <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/gaming-industry/as-microsoft-lays-off-thousands-and-jacks-up-game-pass-prices-former-ftc-chair-says-i-told-you-so-the-activision-blizzard-buyout-is-harming-both-gamers-and-developers/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hmmm</a>.</p><p>The latter comparison is especially apt when taken alongside the growing chorus of voices calling for greater regulatory scrutiny of the EA deal. In the immediate aftermath (dot site) of the sale’s announcement, US senators Elizabeth Warren and Richard Blumenthal <a href="https://www.hsgac.senate.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025-10-14-Letter-from-Blumenthal-and-Warren-to-Secretary-Bessent-re-Electronic-Arts.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sent</a> <a href="https://www.hsgac.senate.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025-10-14-Letter-from-Blumenthal-and-Warren-to-Electronic-Arts-CEO-Andrew-Wilson.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">letters</a> to US Treasury Secretary and Committee Of Foreign Investment chair Scott Bessent and Electronic Arts CEO Andrew Wilson warning of risks that include "surveillance of Americans, covert Saudi propaganda, and selective retaliation and censorship of persons disfavored by the Saudi government."&nbsp;</p><p>Workers at EA, in collaboration with <a href="https://aftermath.site/uvw-cwa-video-game-union-microsoft-trump-musk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CWA’s direct-join video game union</a>, have also voiced extreme suspicion of the deal, saying in a statement last month that they and theirs stand to be “jeopardized as a result of this deal” despite the fact that they were “not represented at all when this buyout was negotiated or discussed.”</p><p>“We are calling on regulators and elected officials to scrutinize this deal and ensure that any path forward protects jobs, preserves creative freedom, and keeps decision-making accountable to the workers who make EA successful,” the EA workers wrote.</p><p>Most recently, CWA president Claude Cummings Jr sent formal letters to the Federal Trade Commission and the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States calling for a comprehensive review of the deal.</p><p>“This deal is not about innovation or growth for the U.S. economy – it’s about handing control to a small group of powerful investors and putting thousands of jobs and sensitive consumer data at risk,” said Cummings Jr in a statement of his own. “I’m calling on CFIUS Chair Scott Bessent and FTC Chairman Andrew N. Ferguson to scrutinize this deal carefully and to ensure that this deal protects American workers, consumers, and the future of the video game industry.”</p><p>Of course, Trump’s FTC is different from Biden’s FTC, which, under now-former-commissioner Lina Khan, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-12-18/biden-antitrust-enforcers-set-new-record-for-merger-challenges?embedded-checkout=true" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">blocked a record number of mergers</a> in an attempt to stem the tide of monopoly power in the US. On top of that, it is impossible to ignore the fact that another member of the consortium purchasing EA is Affinity Partners, an investment firm formed by Jared Kushner, Trump’s son-in-law. Trump has also done ample business in Saudi Arabia <a href="https://archive.is/6QLOj" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">since he won the 2024 presidential election</a>. Now, with Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/saudi-crown-prince-bin-salman-will-visit-trump-november-18-white-house-official-2025-11-03/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">set to visit the White House later this month</a> – seemingly to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/01/world/middleeast/mohammed-bin-salman-us-visit.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">discuss a nuclear deal and a defense pact</a> – the odds seemed stacked against those who’d rather not see the EA sale sail right on through.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Elsewhere in games, the International Olympic Committee recently backed out of a deal with the Saudi government to host and operate the Esports Olympic Games. According to <a href="https://esportsadvocate.net/2025/10/esports-breakup-why-the-ioc-backed-out-of-saudi-esports-deal/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a report from The Esports Advocate</a>, the two sides failed see eye-to-eye on the creation of an overseeing federation after the Saudi government concluded that existing options were insufficient. What the Saudi government proposed instead would've been under its control in perpetuity, an arrangement the IOC found untenable. </p><p>The report concludes with the following note:</p><p>"Further, the Saudi contingent pushed back on being forced to put women in leadership positions and adhering to rules on who (what nations) it could or could not allow to participate."</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/europa-universalis-v-review-impressions-paradox-pc-eu5"><h3>How Am I Supposed To Review Europa Universalis V</h3></a><p>There is simply too much video game here, and it's always in motion</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/aftermath-hours-podcast-halo-white-house-trump-vance"><h3>And Also, Who Even Cares About Halo And Lord Of The Rings These Days</h3></a><p>"All of these things do have a feeling of dragging and resuscitating a corpse"</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/final-fantasy-tactics-grind-jp-mandalia-plains"><h3>I Will Grind In Final Fantasy Tactics Every Single Time And You Cannot Stop Me</h3></a><p>Final Fantasy Tactics without grinding Mandalia Plains is like a day without sunshine.</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/us-government-halo-jd-vance-hasan-piker-dog"><h3>We Have Never Been More 12 Years Old</h3></a><p>In the same week government agencies coopted Halo, now we've also got JD Vance weighing on in CollarGate</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div><br/><br/>https://aftermath.site/ea-saudi-arabia-creative-control-jared-kushner-donald-trump]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/hp-17-inch-laptop-with-ryzen-5-nearly-free-71-off-amazon-clearing-stock-for-early-black-friday.1342786/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Most people can’t justify spending over $3,000 on a laptop, even if they desperately need a bigger screen for spreadsheets, video calls and multitasking across multiple windows. These premium business machines usually stay out of reach, reserved for corporate budgets and lucky pros with generous tech allowances.</p>
<p>Amazon just <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5317/">changed the game by slashing this HP 17-inch powerhouse from $3,599 down to $1,029</a>, delivering a 71% discount that feels like Christmas arrived months early. This deal moves a laptop packed with <strong>64GB of RAM and a 2TB SSD</strong> into territory where most people can actually afford it without maxing out credit cards.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5317/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>A Desktop Replacement That Fits Your Budget</h2>
<p>The <strong>AMD Ryzen 5 7430U processor</strong> in this machine cranks up to 4.3GHz across six cores, giving you enough processing muscle to handle demanding spreadsheets, multiple browser tabs, and video streaming all at the same time. Those six cores split workloads intelligently, dedicating processing power where you need it most while managing background tasks efficiently. <strong>Integrated Radeon Graphics</strong> handle everything from PowerPoint presentations to casual gaming and video editing without the need for a dedicated graphics card, which would ramp up the price further.</p>



<p>The <strong>17.3-inch HD+ touchscreen boasts 1600×900 resolution</strong> for significantly more workspace than you’d get from the standard 15-inch laptops that make you constantly switch between windows. This additional screen real estate revolutionizes the way you’re working with documents and spreadsheets, letting you see two pages side by side or keep reference materials visible while you draft emails.</p>
<p>An anti-glare coating reduces eye strain while working long hours under office lights or near windows, and touch functionality lets you navigate with natural gestures like pinching to zoom and swiping between apps. You can tap your way through presentations during meetings or scroll through research papers with your finger, and interactions will feel more intuitive than reaching for a trackpad all the time.</p>



<p>The webcam of the HP True Vision 720p camera has a physical privacy shutter that slides shut when one wants guaranteed off-camera status without paranoia about whether video software actually went off. <strong>AI Noise Reduction filters background chatter in coffee shops</strong>, keyboard typing sounds, and ambient noise that normally ruins video calls to make your voice clear and professional.</p>
<p>HP Fast Charge technology pushes the <strong>battery to 50% capacity in about 45 minutes</strong>, which means a quick charging session between classes or meetings gives you hours of untethered productivity. Under optimum conditions, the battery delivers upwards of nine hours of video playback to cover a full workday of up to long study sessions without hunting for outlets. A <strong>dedicated Copilot key launches Microsoft’s AI assistant</strong> instantaneously for drafting emails, summarizing documents, and generating quick answers to research questions. <strong>Windows 11 Pro</strong> adds in some enterprise features not found in the home edition, such as BitLocker encryption and Remote Desktop, and advanced security tools to safeguard sensitive work files.</p>
<p>For $1,029, you’re getting specifications that would normally see you paying upwards of triple the asking price.</p>

              <p>Keeping your devices charged on the go shouldn’t be a hassle. If you’re done stuffing your bag with a bunch of chargers or constantly hunting for an outlet when you’re out and about, it’s probably time to get a solid power bank; one that won’t quit on you halfway through the day. Thankfully, we just spotted a solid option going for less on Amazon.</p>
<p>The 24,000mAh, 3-port Anker <em>737</em> power bank<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4200/"> is down to $74 currently, down from $110</a>. That’s 32% off a high-capacity option but the discount might end soon.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4200/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Ultra-Fast Charging for All Your Essentials</h2>
<p>The Anker 737 comes with a 24,000mAh capacity, which is enough to charge an iPhone 16 Pro over four times, or give a 13-inch iPad Pro (2024 model) more than a full recharge. The 140W max fast charging delivers serious speed. You can charge a 16-inch MacBook Pro or M3 MacBook Air to 50% in just 33 minutes. The iPhone 16 Pro and Samsung Galaxy S23 take only 26 minutes to hit the same mark. This is possible through Power Delivery 3.1, but you’ll want to pair it with a 5A USB-C cable and a 140W adapter to hit full speed.</p>
<p>You’re getting three ports to charge multiple devices at once. These include two USB-C and one USB-A port. There’s also a smart digital display on the front that keeps you in the loop about output and input power and estimated recharge time.</p>



<p>The power bank itself recharges quickly, too. When you’re using a compatible 140W charger, you can go from empty to full in just under an hour. In comparison, most portable chargers in this capacity class take around 7 hours to do the same.</p>
<p>Compatibility is just as impressive. It plays nicely with the latest iPhones, Samsung Galaxy phones, Google Pixel series, MacBooks, iPads, several Windows laptops, plus your accessories like smartwatches and earbuds. It’s also quite lightweight to carry around, so you can take it with you on the go without bulking things up.</p>
<p>In short, if you’ve been looking for a compact charging solution that can power all your essentials up in no time, this power bank/portable charger is a great option to consider. Now is a good time to grab it for less with this Amazon deal.</p>

                <p>In 2015, Obsidian Entertainment launched Pillars of Eternity, a party-based real-time tactical RPG. Now Obsidian is making one of the most significant changes to the game in the last 10 years by introducing a turn-based mode. And Pillars of Eternity players will be able to get their hands on it this week.</p><p>On the <a href="https://eternity.obsidian.net/eternity/news/eternity/public-beta-for-turn-based-mode" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">game's official site</a>, Obsidian announced that the public beta for Pillars of Eternity's turn-based mode will go live on November 5. The real-time combat was inspired by the system used by the game's sequel, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/pillars-of-eternity-ii-deadfire/" data-ref-id="5000-475262">Pillars of Eternity 2: Deadfire</a>. The studio also released an announcement trailer for the new mode to demonstrate it in action.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Mj6HObhD_8" data-width="100%" data-height="100%" data-video-start="189">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/_Mj6HObhD_8?start=189" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>According to Obsidian, the following real-time improvements were made after taking fan feedback from Deadfire.</p><ul><li><strong>Unbound Turns</strong>: All turns are now influenced by a character’s overall speed, improving the value of Real-Time with Pause attributes and mechanics.</li><li><strong>Smarter Free Actions</strong>: Actions like swapping weapons, drinking potions, or enabling modals are now free actions. Each free action is limited to one per turn per type for balance.</li><li><strong>Faster Pacing</strong>: Combat lethality has been significantly increased for both enemies and players to keep battles tense and impactful.</li><li><strong>Mode Flexibility</strong>: You can choose Turn-Based Mode alongside difficulty when starting a new game — or swap freely between Real-Time with Pause and Turn-Based Mode in the game options. We’re also investigating a direct HUD toggle for even more convenience.</li></ul><p>As noted above, players can choose whether or not to embrace turn-based combat, or switch between real-time and turn-based at their desire. The beta test doesn't currently have an end date, but Obsidian notes that it will release future updates in support of this before adding turn-based mode to the game as a permanent feature.</p><p>Josh Sawyer--who directed both Pillars of Eternity games--has suggested that if Pillars of Eternity 3 ever goes forward, it will <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pillars-of-eternity-3-would-be-baldurs-gate-3-style-3d-if-it-ever-happens/1100-6532470/" data-ref-id="1100-6532470">embrace the influence of Baldur's Gate 3</a> and switch from an isometric perspective to a 3D-style game.</p><p>Earlier this year, Obsidian released <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/avowed-review-too-close-to-the-sun/1900-6418335/" data-ref-id="1900-6418335">Avowed</a>, an action-RPG that takes place in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/avowed-series-lore-of-eora-is-here-to-remind-you-its-part-of-the-pillars-of-eternity-franchise/1100-6528947/" data-ref-id="1100-6528947">the same universe as the Pillars of Eternity games</a>.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/ipads-meet-real-competition-amazons-fire-max-11-now-selling-for-pennies-2000640865</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ipads-meet-real-competition-amazon%E2%80%99s-fire-max-11-now-selling-for-pennies.1342759/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Tablets are great for some on-the-go entertainment and light productivity. You can stream your favorite shows, stay connected with friends, and even meet a few deadlines without carrying your laptop or squinting at a small phone screen.</p>
<p>If you’ve been on the lookout for a reliable option with a bright screen, sleek design, and useful features, we recommend checking the Amazon Fire Max 11 tablet out, especially now that it’s going at a discount on Amazon. The retailer is <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4376/">currently offering it for $189, which is a 32% discount on the retail price of $279</a>. This version <strong>does not include lockscreen ads</strong> so you can enjoy a distraction-free, clean experience.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4376/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Bright Visuals, Ultra-Sleek Design</h2>
<p>The tablet flaunts a thin, sleek frame with a massive 11-inch screen. The display gets you a 2000 x 1200 resolution with over 2.4 million pixels, so you can expect bright, clear visuals that make every detail on the screen pop. Colors appear lifelike, with bright highlights and shadows coming through clearly. The tablet is 3 times as durable as the 10th-gen iPad, so while it’s thin, it’s also sturdy enough for everyday use.</p>
<p>Amazon Fire Max 11 runs on a fast octa-core processor and features a modest 4GB of RAM, which keeps things moving smoothly. It’s not massive, but it still does a decent job of handling regular tasks like browsing, streaming, and light work without slowing down. Storage-wise, you’re covered with a 128GB capacity. It’s more than enough to house a ton of media content and programs, but you also have the option to expand it up to 1TB with a microSD card.</p>
<p>Battery life stretches up to 14 hours, meaning you can go at least a couple of days without worrying about plugging it in. There’s also an 8 MP camera for clearer video calls with friends and family.</p>
<p>You’re even getting 3 months of Microsoft 365 Personal thrown in for free with your purchase, which gets you access to several productivity apps. If you’re planning to use the tablet for work or creative tasks, you can also consider adding Amazon’s keyboard case and Made for Amazon stylus pen for a complete setup. Just note that the discount might expire soon. It’s best to get your orders in sooner rather than later.</p>

A demo is currently available. <span id="more-1004403"></span></p><p>Here are the latest details:</p><blockquote><p><strong>Why We Chose to Release in Early Access</strong></p><p>While many players enjoyed the demo, it also helped us identify a number of areas for improvement, such as overall usability and control feel.</p><p>After carefully evaluating the situation, we concluded that launching the game in Early Access—where we can continue to refine it step by step based on player feedback—would be the best approach.</p><p>The main feedback we received included:</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <ul><li>Requests to improve combat responsiveness and pacing.</li><li>Comments on tutorial and user interface clarity.</li><li>Requests for controller support.</li><li>Suggestions for expanding <a title="Genres > RPG [17,758 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/rpg">role-playing</a> options and rebalancing.</li></ul><p><strong>Development Roadmap</strong></p><p>Development will proceed in two phases: work leading up to the Early Access release, and updates following its launch.</p><ul><li><strong>Work Planned Before Early Access Release</strong><ul><li><strong>Combat Controls and Pacing Improvements</strong> – We’re refining combat feel and enemy AI behavior to make battles smoother and more strategic, reducing sources of frustration.</li><li><strong>User Interface Improvements Centered on Dialogue Flow</strong> – We’ve revisited the tutorial and eliminated elements that interrupted play, creating a smoother and more intuitive experience.</li><li><strong>Game Balance Adjustments</strong> – We’re reworking mechanics that made the early game disproportionately easy and fine-tuning overall balance.</li><li><strong>New Feature Additions</strong> – We’re adding several systems that were not available in the demo, including:<ul><li>Access to Sandbox Mode from the beginning of the game</li><li>A new “Found a Nation” path for independent factions</li><li>Romance interactions with NPCs</li></ul></li></ul></li><li><strong>Work Planned After Early Access Release</strong><ul><li><strong>Major User Interface Overhaul</strong> – The current interface is designed primarily for mouse input.

As the protagonist, you leave your foster parent’s home one day and embark on a journey as an unknown wanderer. In a world where the motives of numerous NPCs intertwine, and cooperation and betrayal collide, you become a part of this world and can live freely as you choose.</p><p><strong>Stop the Collapse of the World</strong></p><p>Your mission is singular: to stop the collapse of the world.

However, instead of utilizing its own steering sensors for inputs, it uses the Joy-Con 2's built-in gyro sensors and rumble function. The wheel features two slots that both Joy-Con 2 fit into, so you can access the Switch 2's standard button layout while enjoying a more realistic way to play racing games with motion steering. The wheel attaches to desks or tables with suction cups under the base, and since it simply uses the Joy-Con 2, you don't need to plug it into your Switch 2 or provide it with any power. Note that this accessory is not compatible with the original Nintendo Switch, as the Joy-Con has a different shape and size.</p>                      </div><p>This new steering wheel accessory isn't the only Switch 2 controller peripheral designed for racing games and gyro controls, but it's certainly the most robust and immersive of its kind released so far. That said, the other options are worth checking out, too, since they're smaller and even <em>more </em>affordable than Numbskull's new device.

Unlike Numbskull's full-size wheel, these Joy-Con 2 drips don't attach to a base; instead, you slot in a single Joy-Con 2, hold it out in front of you, and twist it to simulate steering. It's less realistic, but they're a good option for younger and more casual fans who want a comfortable way to play racing games with gyro controls, especially if you plan on sharing the Joy-Con 2 controllers with another player.</p><h2>Switch 2 Racing Wheel Accessories</h2><ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Nintendo-Switch-Controller-Compatible-Accessories-2/dp/B0FFCGW32L?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Fosmon Switch 2 Ergonomic Grip</a> -- $10.81</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/HEYSTOP-Controller-Compatible-Accessories-Ergonomic/dp/B0F2FR71DW?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Heystop 4-Pack of Joy-Con 2 Grips</a> -- $20</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FH6QN5JS?tag=gamespot-preorders-20&amp;tag=gamespot-buybutton-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Numskull Joy-Con Steering Wheel for Switch 2</a> -- $30 | Releases November 22</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Test-17-Nintendo-Switch/dp/B09Z1FRRJP?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Nintendo Joy-Con 2 Wheel (Set of 2)</a> -- $24.88</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Switch-Steering-Racing-Compatible-Nintendo-2/dp/B0F9WCMQGT?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">TNP Switch 2 Racing Wheel</a> -- $12</li></ul><hr><p>As mentioned above, these racing wheel accessories are compatible with racing games like Mario Kart World, adding a layer of immersion you wouldn't get by playing with the Joy Con 2 or other gamepad by itself.

            <link>https://kotaku.com/apple-has-dropped-its-11-inch-ipad-a-new-record-low-practically-giving-it-away-2000640860</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/apple-has-dropped-its-11-inch-ipad-a-new-record-low-practically-giving-it-away-%E2%9A%A1%EF%B8%8F.1342750/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Black Friday and Cyber Monday are still a few weeks out, but some of the year’s best tech deals are already rolling in. That makes now a great time to grab Apple gear, especially since the brand rarely offers direct discounts. And if you’ve had your eye on a new iPad, now might be the time to act.</p>
<p>Currently, the 11-inch WiFi Apple iPad with the superfast <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4533/">A16 chip ans 128GB storage is sitting at $299 on Amazon, which is 14% off its regular $349 price</a>. Even better, all color options are discounted, so whether you’re looking for a basic silver or want something with a pop of color, you’ve got options. The only catch? There’s no telling how long the discount or the stock will last, so we recommend acting fast if you want to lock it in.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4533/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Stunning Visuals, Impressive Performance</h2>
<p>You’re getting an 11-inch Liquid Retina display that supports a 2360 x 1640 resolution for stunning visuals. True Tone automatically adjusts the display according to the color temperature of your room, so you won’t have to manually tweak brightness or other settings to stay comfortable.</p>
<p>The device runs on iPadOS and is powered by Apple’s A16 chip that ensures speedy, snappy performance, even when you’re hopping between multiple apps at once. This version comes with 128GB of storage, which is more than enough to house all your important data in one place. 128GB is the sweet spot for most users, but if it feels limited, you can upgrade to models with up to 512GB of storage. Though, of course, those come with a higher price tag.</p>



<p>There’s a 12MP front camera for clear video calls, plus a 12MP rear camera to snap photos. The front camera features Center Stage, so you stay the center of attention on calls, not your couch in the background. Connectivity is made easy with Wi-Fi 6 built in, and the all-day battery life helps you get through your busiest days without stressing about running out of charge.</p>
<p>If you’re looking for a full work or creative setup on the go, you can always add Apple’s Magic Keyboard Folio and USB-C Apple Pencil, both of which are sold separately. For $299, you’re getting solid value packed in a slim, sleek build. If an iPad has been on your wishlist, this might be your best chance to grab it before the holiday rush hits.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dispatch-sells-over-a-million-copies-in-10-days.1342729/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The superhero narrative game Dispatch has already sold over a million copies in just ten days. Bolstered by a big cast and impressive production team, the game is already one of 2025’s biggest games.</p>



<p>Released in late October with episodes 1 and 2, Dispatch follows a former superhero working a desk job and dispatching former villains to do good in Los Angeles. AdHoc Studios, composed of former Telltale Games members, keeps the spirit of its pedigree alive with a Choose-Your-Own-Adventure-type dialogue choices and consequences. The game became <a href="https://x.com/theAdHocStudio/status/1981416301709934652" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the best-selling title</a> on Steam last week, though it was unknown just how much it sold. Now, we have an official number and it’s quite impressive.</p>



<h2 id="h-dispatch-hits-impressive-sales-record-in-only-10-days">Dispatch Hits Impressive Sales Record in Only 10 Days</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>In <a href="https://x.com/theAdHocStudio/status/1985470807804453077" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a tweet from AdHoc Studios</a>, the team reveals that Dispatch has sold one million copies in ten days. With only four episodes out, the game technically isn’t fully out yet. Therefore, it’s a pretty impressive feat to sell as much, especially since the studio is new. </p>



<p>It isn’t too surprising to see Dispatch get as popular as it is. With a cast led by Breaking Bad’s Aaron Paul and Telltale’s narrative sense, it struck a lot of notes for fans. Plus, even with four episodes, it’s already a hit with critics and fans. We at Insider Gaming reviewed the title’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dispatch-episodes-1-2-spoiler-free-review/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">first two episodes</a> and loved our time with it. With how things have been shaping up for Dispatch, we could see a surprise newcomer to the Game of the Year discussions right at the tail end of 2025.</p>



<p>What do you think of Dispatch’s sales so far? Have you played it yet? If so, what do you think? Where does it rank for you for 2025?

  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
Unfortunately, we are here yet again with another games studio that will seemingly be closing its doors for good. A couple of years ago, Greg Street, known for his work on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/world-of-warcraft">World of Warcraft</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/league-of-legends">League of Legends</a>, set up Fantastic Pixel Castle. There, it was announced at the time, he would lead development on an <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-mmos-mmorpgs">MMO</a> codenamed <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/ghost">Ghost</a>, with NetEase serving as publisher. Except in a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7391147465636397057/">LinkedIn post</a> earlier today, Street shared that Fantastic Pixel Castle will be shutting down.
</p>
<p>
"Fantastic Pixel Castle will close its doors on Nov 17," Street wrote. "While there is still a chance we can secure funding after that date, it will depend on how much of the team remains. While we'd love to make our game, our first priority is to help our developers find employment, whether that's at indie studio Fantastic Pixel Castle 2.0, or at many of the other fine (and hopefully stable) game and tech companies out there."
</p>
<p>
This latest closure, assuming that no one swoops in to save the day with presumably a few million dollars, is just the latest cut in a line of them from NetEase. The publishing giant <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/netease-reward-us-based-developers-of-live-service-hit-marvel-rivals-by-sacrificing-their-jobs-to-efficiency">kicked off the year</a> by laying off a number of US-based devs working on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/marvel-rivals">Marvel Rivals</a>, and in August they also shuttered T-Minus Zero Entertainment, a studio also founded two years ago by former BioWare developer and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/star-wars-the-old-republic">Star Wars: The Old Republic</a> executive producer Rich Vogel, not to mention a <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/jar-of-sparks-halts-production-on-debut-game-as-it-looks-for-new-publisher">number of other studios</a> facing <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/just-cause-creators-new-studio-suffers-layoffs-before-launching-first-game">cuts</a> or <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/former-mass-effect-writers-studio-worlds-untold-are-pausing-operations-in-what-staff-call-a-studio-closure">closures</a>.
</p>
<p>
Not much was known about Ghost, and without a savior it might stay that way. It's not the only unreleased MMO to be cancelled within the last week either, as <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/amazon-have-reportedly-cancelled-their-lord-of-the-rings-mmo-again">Amazon recently did so with their Lord of the Rings MMO</a>. Fingers crossed for all the devs at Fantastic Pixel Castle.

            <link>https://kotaku.com/new-fan-made-courage-the-cowardly-dog-game-perfect-creepy-dreams-ps4-2000640924</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/new-fan-made-courage-the-cowardly-dog-game-looks-perfect-and-creepy.1342717/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Despite being a beloved, award-winning, and popular cartoon,<em> Courage the Cowardly Dog</em> never got an official video game adaptation. And since the show has been out of production for over 23 years now, it’s unlikely to ever get one at this point. But don’t worry, one fan is working hard on making the <em>Courage</em> game you’ve always wanted, and it’s close to launching. You’ll just need a copy of <em>Dreams</em> to play it.</p> <p>Here’s the latest trailer for <a spellcheck="false" href="https://www.youtube.com/@elgatodeltejado">El Gato Del Tejado’s</a> upcoming <em>Courage the Cowardly Dog</em> game, which reveals that the full game will finally be available on November 28, following a previously released demo and <a href="https://youtu.be/0CyY0HVccjY">nearly two years of development</a>. I think the trailer perfectly captures the creepy and surreal vibes of the original Cartoon Network show, complete with Courage screaming and monsters trying to kill him and his owners.</p>

  <p>The weird part about El Gato Del Tejado’s upcoming fan game is that it’s not being developed in Unreal or Unity, as you might expect. Instead, the creator (who is also <a href="https://youtu.be/2HiRJrvvp58">remastering <em>The</em> <em>Simpsons Hit &amp; Run</em></a> and working on other cool projects) has chosen to use <em>Dreams</em> to build this creepy <em>Courage</em> game.</p>

 <p>Remember <em>Dreams</em>? It was the next creative game from <em>LittleBigPlanet</em> studio Media Molecule and offered players a full suite of tools to create and share their own games. Sadly, <a href="https://kotaku.com/the-ps4s-spectacular-dreams-game-is-hurting-from-a-lack-1845925922">the game’s community dried up</a> after it became clear that <em>Dreams</em> would never be supported on PC or <a href="https://kotaku.com/dreams-ps4-ps5-media-molecule-last-update-date-1850323245">get the long-term care it needed</a>. But that hasn’t stopped El Gato from devoting the last few years to becoming a truly skilled <em>Dreams</em> developer. And the <em>Courage</em> game really shows this off. I think if you showed that trailer above to most people, they’d not guess it was made in <em>Dreams</em>.</p> <p>Regardless of how it was made, I’ll be checking it out later this month when it launches on PS4/PS5 via <em>Dreams</em>. I just need to uh…download <em>Dreams</em> again.</p>

            <link>https://aftermath.site/europa-universalis-v-review-impressions-paradox-pc-eu5</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/how-am-i-supposed-to-review-europa-universalis-v.1342711/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>As one of the nerdiest Paradox grand strategy series around--and that's saying something--you would think that giving someone nearly an entire month to review the latest <em>Europa Universalis</em> game would be more than enough time to get a handle on it. And yet!</p><p>Despite Paradox giving reviewers a remarkably generous lead-in--only a select few Japanese series like <em>Yakuza </em>or <em>Persona</em> have given as long in recent memory--as the <em>Europa Universalis V</em> embargo crept ever-closer last week I found myself staring at my disjointed notes and a blank page thinking "man, there is just no way I can review this".</p><p>Not because I can't review grand strategy games themselves--<a href="https://kotaku.com/victoria-3-review-paradox-pc-kotaku-impressions-verdict-1849669988" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">I love doing that!</a>--but because whether intentionally or not, Paradox's first-party efforts have over the last few years become increasingly malleable things, changing their core features and sometimes entire vibes every time an expansion, update or even patch rolls around.</p><p><em>Victoria 3</em>, for example, has had a rollercoaster ride of tweaks and balances since launch. And <em>Crusader Kings III</em>, which somehow released over five years ago now, has in that timeframe become almost something else entirely, landing as a prettier<em> Crusader Kings II </em>before turning into everything from a singleplayer RPG to, in its latest expansion, a game that spans as far as China and Japan.</p><p>Both of which are fine, maybe even great in <em>CK3's</em> case, but all that meddling makes the idea of some kind of review at <em>Europa Universalis V's</em> exact time of launch feel almost irrelevant. What the hell is the point of me giving a long list of thoughts about this game now, in October 2025, when by March 2027 it could be an entirely different experience? Especially when, unlike its more focused stablemates, <em>EU5 </em>is ambitious enough to let you play a single game that begins in the 1300s and ends just before the American Civil War, which means we are messing with a <em>lot </em>of variables here.</p><p>Even just during the time I've had a pre-release copy of <em>EU5</em>,<em> </em>the goalposts have moved a number of times, with seemingly harmless bugs (like an overpowered Papacy) repeatedly patched out because they were messing up people’s campaigns. And as much as there is already in the game, you can still see the outline of where there's going to be (over the course of years of expansions) so much more, whether it be fleshing out the storylines of minor nations to making more far-flung tribes and nations playable.</p><p>Also standing in my way of being able to give some kind of proper "review" of <em>EU5 </em>is the fact that, even with weeks to play it, I still feel like I've barely scratched the surface of its systems and possibilities. Some of the updates made to my pre-release copy broke older saves, so I've only had time to play as three nations (Holland, England and Scotland), and there's so much to this game that it might be months before I've fully come to grips with stuff like its economic management.</p><p>In many ways these games have become their own kind of MMO or Forever Shooter. Many outlets won't score games like that anymore, or will update their thoughts several times as they go. <a href="https://kotaku.com/crusader-kings-ii-the-kotaku-re-review-1783955128" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Some of my favourite pieces of critical work over the past decade</a> haven't been reviews of Paradox games but re-reviews of them,<a href="https://kotaku.com/hearts-of-iron-iv-the-kotaku-re-review-1847022998" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> checking in years after release to see how they've evolved and bedded in</a>. To me that feels like the best time to not just experience a Paradox game but to talk about one.</p><figure><figcaption>Go on, pick one</figcaption></figure><p>What I <em>can </em>say now, after spending over 100 hours with a game I nevertheless feel I can’t “review,” is that what's there is pretty good! I think. I'm primarily a <em>Crusader Kings</em> and <em>Hearts of Iron</em> guy. I'm not and have never really been an <em>EU </em>guy and that, combined with a weird bug on my last PC that never let me get past the title screen on <em>EU4</em>, means I haven't touched the series since at least 2019, so going into this new entry I couldn't remember <em>shit</em>. I had no idea what was new or just improved, and it took me days just to learn (or re-learn) how to play the game, even with some fairly substantial tutorials attached.</p><p>One thing I did instantly appreciate though was a substantial, <em>Football Manager</em>-like series of automation tools. Anywhere you see a gear icon--and that's on practically every menu screen in every aspect of the game--you can click it and the AI will take over that part of your nation's affairs for you. While maybe not necessary for series fiends, or anyone running one of the game's 117,000 tiny German principalities, I found it invaluable when playing as a larger nation (like England) because I simply couldn't be bothered tinkering with every little building and trade deal when I had more important things to do, like exploring distant lands, insulting the Papacy and beating up on France.</p><p>The amount of stuff I managed to outsource to the AI was impressive in that it liberated my attention span, and also let me see just how much of the game I still had to learn, which returns to my point above; even with weeks to play <em>EU5 </em>I'm still discovering fundamental things every time I make an errant mouse click or stumble on a hovering tooltip I hadn't noticed before. I didn't know I had to manually upgrade a town to a city until last week. I only found out you could build bridges from a fellow 3MA panellist in a Discord chat. There's simply too much game here for me to even discover, let alone pass comprehensive judgement on, at this stage of its life.</p><p>Even with the AI running vast parts of my empire, constant pop-up events still kept me busy, and there's a surprising variety of them, each tailored not just to the age but the people and place as well. Playing as Scotland, I got a number of very Scottish decisions to make, and helpfully the game even has an icon telling you which one is the historical choice if you want to go down that route. Fighting a war is pretty standard Paradox stuff, as is diplomacy, and while slightly cumbersome (in that you can't simply explore a whole ocean, you can only unlock small sections of it at a time) the game's exploration section also works pretty easily.</p><p>This superficial side of the game, a feast of just the icing, no cake, was a blast. With no personal interest in the fine details this game offers--the numbers run so deep you can burrow down and see each item being traded in every port, and the specific population breakdown of every town and region in your nation--I loved just focusing on the big picture, and really did feel like I was some kind of demigod managing every aspect of my people's lives for 500 years.</p><p>Playing as Scotland I got caught in a messy land war in Ireland. I speedran my break from a corrupt and decadent Catholic Church. I agreed to divide the new world (where I'd founded Scottish colonies everywhere from Greenland to Georgia) with the Pope. I survived the black death, explored the seas and was constantly having to mediate between the vested interests of my nobles, workers and priests. All without ever once dipping into the game's production and trading systems, which lurk beneath the surface of <em>Europa Universalis</em> like the bulk of an iceberg.</p><p>Oh, I also had a family to marry off, a complicated alliance with France to maintain, kids to educate, a cabinet to oversee, parliaments to organise and massage votes through, 500 years of scientific research to read over, uprisings to quell, roads to build, navies to maintain. Even on this icing-only diet, there's a LOT TO DO.</p><figure><figcaption>There are hundreds of Kingdoms and nations you can play as, so getting customised events like this one is very fun</figcaption></figure><p>I'm not just listing all of that here for the quantity's sake; it all feels consequential. I could always see the reactions to my decisions: shifting prices affect people's welfare and happiness, leading to revolts or migrations or both, and spending money on education got me a more literate population and loads of visible benefits as a result. I have no idea how robust any of this is on a long-term basis--to reiterate once more, I did not come close to surveying this game in its entirety--but it certainly looked and felt real, empowering even.</p><p>With its lack of a fully-fledged character system and a (relatively) simple approach to fighting wars, it may lack the personal touch of <em>Crusader Kings </em>or the brutal satisfaction of <em>Hearts of Iron</em>, but <em>EU5 </em>is still Paradox at their best: giving the player a place and time in human history and letting them not just live through it, but dictate its terms.</p><p>I played this game a lot over the last month, and what I played, even with its limitations, I loved. I can see myself playing a lot more in the years to come, maybe even enough to fully understand how to play whole sections of it and be able to report back with a better idea of what this game eventually becomes, not what it is at launch.&nbsp;</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/ea-saudi-arabia-creative-control-jared-kushner-donald-trump"><h3>EA Says It Will Retain Creative Control Following Saudi Sale, But, Like, Come On</h3></a><p>Big companies have shown time and time again that they'll say whatever is necessary to get mergers approved</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/aftermath-hours-podcast-halo-white-house-trump-vance"><h3>And Also, Who Even Cares About Halo And Lord Of The Rings These Days</h3></a><p>"All of these things do have a feeling of dragging and resuscitating a corpse"</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/final-fantasy-tactics-grind-jp-mandalia-plains"><h3>I Will Grind In Final Fantasy Tactics Every Single Time And You Cannot Stop Me</h3></a><p>Final Fantasy Tactics without grinding Mandalia Plains is like a day without sunshine.</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/us-government-halo-jd-vance-hasan-piker-dog"><h3>We Have Never Been More 12 Years Old</h3></a><p>In the same week government agencies coopted Halo, now we've also got JD Vance weighing on in CollarGate</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div><br/><br/>https://aftermath.site/europa-universalis-v-review-impressions-paradox-pc-eu5]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Sidekicks seemed like a slam dunk for <em>Fortnite</em>. Add customizable pets that follow you around during matches and impress your friends. What could go wrong? Well, given the way they’ve been implemented in the <a href="https://kotaku.com/fortnite-simpsons-mini-season-review-changes-new-map-short-2000640868">current <em>Simpsons</em> season</a>, a lot, apparently. One dramatic rallying cry within the community is calling for players to boycott the newest microtransaction opportunity over accusations of “greed.”</p> <p>There are three main issues. The first is that Sidekicks—a banana dog named Peels <a href="https://www.fortnite.com/news/introducing-fortnite-sidekicks?lang=en-US">went live in the battle pass on November 1</a>—can only be customized once. After selecting things like size, color, and so on, you can’t go back to change them, forcing you to buy a second Sidekick if you want them to look different. Second, opponents can’t see Sidekicks, only your squadmates. And third, upcoming Sidekicks will be very expensive, at least according to <a href="https://x.com/FortnitePV2/status/1984100625651790002">alleged leaks</a>. Some suggest prices as high as 2,800 V-Bucks a piece. Not great!</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Hey <a href="https://twitter.com/Fortnite?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@Fortnite</a> please make the pricing more reasonable and let us edit our pets to whatever we want and for FREE once we own it.</p> <p>“You can purchase the same Sidekick multiple times to give them different Appearances” <a href="https://t.co/0B1CtTtDwS">pic.twitter.com/0B1CtTtDwS</a></p> <p>— Fortnite Leaks | Pluto V2 (@FortnitePV2) <a href="https://twitter.com/FortnitePV2/status/1984100625651790002?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 31, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>“Why do I care so much about this?” wrote Mabdog420 <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/1omtr3l/please_do_not_buy_sidekicks/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">on the<em> Fortnite</em> subreddit</a>. “Why not just not buy the sidekicks and shut up about it? Because if we let this go unchecked it will ONLY GET WORSE. Epic always tries to implement predatory pricing or practices like reducing xp gains, and every time we’ve had to fight back to stop it.”</p>

 <p>Some players in the comments reported being sent a user survey ahead of Sidekicks officially joining the<em> Fortnite</em> shop on November 7. “How do you feel about having to purchase an additional copy of the same sidekick if you want to customize your sidekick with different features?” it asks. Many are putting “Strongly Dislike” and wondering who on god’s green earth would put anything else.</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Fortnite is currently sending out surveys to players, asking them about sidekicks and their controversial features 👀</p> <p>They want to know what players think about "basic features" being permanently locked and the option to re-purchase them <a href="https://t.co/oJUEODR32C">pic.twitter.com/oJUEODR32C</a></p> <p>— Shiina (@ShiinaBR) <a href="https://twitter.com/ShiinaBR/status/1985016913072927059?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 2, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>Others have little faith that the broader <em>Fortnite</em> community will be able to resist, citing the <a href="https://x.com/FortniteGame/status/1852515768732139725">addition of cosmetic shoes a year ago</a> that other players can barely see but that enough people are seemingly spending real money to buy anyway. “I still find the shoes a bigger scam than this,” one player wrote. The ongoing trend is making some fans lose hope.</p> <p>“Like someone who started pretty early in the game it makes me so sad to see what this has become,” another player wrote. “It’s like Once-ler in the Lorax but a game, to where we have to fight a metaphorical war just to get fair treatment. then having to settle with the plain oatmeal that they give us that’s just slightly tastier then all the other brands on the market so that’s why we stay. It’s just so tiring and such a depressing way for a gaming company to be seen and be ran.”</p>

</div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
Friendslop games may come and go, but the (for all intents and purposes) progenitor of them all, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/lethal-company">Lethal Company</a> is still the one I think of most. It's scary, it's funny, it's otherworldly, literally, there's so much mystery to it that you just want to spend time in its world. But while it will likely go down as solo dev Zeekerss' most notable work, he did just release a brand new horror game 10 years in the making. And in a recent interview, he spoke of how he got his start in horror, and the roots that make up his latest work.
</p>
<p>
Speaking to <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/horror/i-dont-know-why-but-it-feels-like-fear-has-been-my-primary-emotion-ever-since-i-was-a-kid-lethal-company-creator-says-horror-games-still-feel-like-home-as-his-10-year-project-finally-ends/">GamesRadar</a>, Zeekerss noted that he "didn't start by making horror games, but I found my home in this genre. I don't know why, but it feels like fear has been my primary emotion ever since I was a kid. But it's a deeper thing; the emotional spectrum of fear and courage, hope and despair, is my way of interpreting the world. As an artist, it's my first language. I can branch out to other genres, but they'll always find their context in that."
</p>
<p>
You can really feel that even within Lethal Company. It's a horror game, sure, but through play it becomes a comedy, a drama, a tragedy, it's capable of a lot more than just scares. When it comes to his latest game, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/welcome-to-the-dark-place">Welcome To The Dark Place</a>, Zeekerss speaks of a pretty broad influence too, citing games like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/kentucky-route-zero">Kentucky Route Zero</a> and its magical realism. "That game does this thing where it dives into dizzying, text-based 'rabbit holes' in which you tell yourself the story," he said.
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/stories-untold">Stories Untold</a> from No Code (now Screen Burn, currently working on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/silent-hill-townfall">Silent Hill: Townfall</a>) served as inspiration too, but the big one is the classic text-based adventure game Zork. "When I was a kid, maybe 10 years old, somebody loaded up Zork on the family computer and let me loose. I remember feeling like it was the most realistic and mysterious game I had ever played," Zeekerss explained.
</p><p>
I'm sure a burning question you might have is "how the hell did a text-based game take 10 years to make?" Well, the answer is good old fashioned scope creep. With text being infinitely easier to implement than 3D models or environments, as Zeekerss puts it, "As soon as I think of something, it can be playable." But because of that, it kind of got out of control, something he described as, at times, "maddening."
</p>
<p>
In the years since starting it, games like Lethal Company and his other works like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/it-steals">It Steals</a> and Dead Seater obviously got in the way too. But Zeekerss continues to be an interesting developer because of the fact he doesn't pin himself down to one type of game, even if horror is something he'll always come back to.
</p>
<p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/games/mlb-slugfest-2003">Remember<em> MLB Slugfest 2003</em></a>? If you do remember this over-the-top PS2-era baseball game, it’s likely because of its often funny color commentators, Tim and Jimmy, who offered up bizarre or crude jokes and stories between hits. And it turns out that some of the duo’s lines went a bit too far for the MLB 20 years ago.</p> <p>Published by Midway Sports in 2002 for PS2, Xbox, and GameCube, <a href="https://youtu.be/Ngx93LcdCyI"><em>MLB Slugfest 2003</em></a> was an arcade-y baseball game heavily inspired by <a href="https://kotaku.com/come-to-think-of-it-the-original-nfl-blitz-did-have-a-5911734">Midway’s popular <em>NFL Blitz</em> series</a>. Like <em>Blitz</em>, <em>Slugfest 2003</em> added a lot of chaos, violence, and humor into the classic sport in a way that I can’t imagine Major League Baseball would be okay with in 2025. But even back in the early 2000s, the MLB wasn’t on board for <em>all</em> of Midway’s naughty jokes and dark commentary bits. Now, thanks to the excellent <a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-retro-classic-virtual-console-piracy-vghf-hist-1848558311">Video Game History Foundation</a>, we can hear which jokes crossed the line with MLB execs.</p>

 <p>On November 3, the VGHF posted a video on social media sharing some of the group’s favorite cut commentary jokes from<em> MLB Slugfest 2003</em>. The VGHF, a nonprofit dedicated to preserving and sharing video game history, says these cut lines, as well as some documents related to<em> MLB Slugfest’</em>s unused jokes, were discovered in the group’s archives on a CD.</p>   <p>Over on the VGHF’s archives, <a href="https://archive.gamehistory.org/item/c664b6e7-5b8c-409d-b92a-f45a4aebe9e8">you can find a document seemingly sent over to Midway</a>, presumably from the MLB, listing <a href="https://us.preservica.com/Render/render/external?entityRef=c664b6e7-5b8c-409d-b92a-f45a4aebe9e8&amp;token=17e03a1a-f2fc-42e4-a85e-9a8af97d201a">all the jokes</a> that were “disapproved” for use in the finished game. Some of these jokes are bad, and I totally support the MLB for asking for them to be cut. But some of the cut jokes don’t seem too bad. For example, this line:</p>

 <blockquote><p>“Baseball’s the greatest sport in the world, but one thing I liked growing up was taking a pop bottle and breaking it with a rock.”</p></blockquote> <p>That’s just funny. But perhaps my favorite cut line that is, admittedly a bit dark, is this one:</p> <blockquote><p>“Jimmy: Tim, have you ever wondered if this booth could just collapse and kill the both of us?”</p> <p>“Tim: Jimmy, it’s all I think about.”</p></blockquote> <p>Anyway, you can check out all the cut lines and more from <em>MLB Slugfest 2003</em> over on the VGHF’s fantastic publicly accessible digital library and archive, <a href="https://kotaku.com/vghf-old-retro-game-magazines-read-online-free-library-1851751951">which also contains over 1,500 video game magazines</a> that can be accessed for free. <a href="https://gamehistory.org/donate/">Though I recommend kicking over a few bucks to VGHF if you can, as the group is doing the work that publishers won’t</a> and that’s worth supporting.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/sims-4-ea-saudi-arabia-acquisition-gay-relationships-2000640899</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Fans of several of EA’s franchises are worried about what might happen to their favorite games and series now that the publisher and all its subsidiaries are </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/ea-sale-saudi-arabia-madden-pif-jared-kushner-2000629829"><span>being acquired</span></a><span> by some of the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/electronic-arts-acquisition-saudi-arabia-jared-kushner-2000629849"><span>worst people and forces you could possibly imagine</span></a><span>. The Saudi Arabian government and Donald Trump’s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, are buying out the company behind games like </span><i><span>The Sims</span></i><span>, BioWare’s catalog, and </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/apex-legends-lgbtqia-characters-tournament-saudi-arabia-1851411189"><i><span>Apex Legends</span></i></a><span>, all of which are known and celebrated for their queer characters and storylines. Fans are so worried about what might happen to these games and their inclusive design moving forward that </span><i><span>Sims </span></i><span>content creators have </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/sims-4-youtubers-pokemon-legends-z-a-sales-2000638834"><span>opted out of the series’ creator program</span></a><span> over the acquisition. With so much uncertainty lingering over the company right now, fans can’t help but wonder what franchises like </span><i><span>The Sims </span></i><span>might look like after all the papers are signed. One of the original leads on the game says that if </span><i><span>The Sims </span></i><span>were to abandon the queer community, it would lose the heart and soul of what has made the life sim series so popular since its debut in 2000.</span></p> <p><span>In an interview with </span><a href="https://frvr.com/blog/news/the-sims-designer-says-that-the-series-diversity-is-critical-especially-at-times-like-now/"><i><span>FRVR</span></i></a><span>, original </span><i><span>Sims </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Sims 2</span></i><span> artist and director Charles London explained that representing same-sex relationships is “incredibly important” to the spirit of the franchise.</span></p> <p><span>“It’s everything,” London told </span><i><span>FRVR</span></i><span>, “and I think it’s existential for the business, right? It is certainly for society. I think it’s incredibly important for there to be a mainstream, beloved brand that says ‘love is love and people are people’ and all the things that I certainly personally believe in, but also I believe it is existential to that business because it is what allows it to be universally appealing, right? Young, old, male, female, gay, straight, other, right? American, Iranian, whatever.</span></p> <p><span>“Its appeal and its recognition of the fundamental truths of our humanity is what creates the empathetic and emotional connection to that game that makes it so powerful,” he continued. “It’s not that there’s so many pants you can dress them in. Don’t get me wrong, that’s an important part of the business, right? That’s also existential… but it’s very connected to evergreen toys like Barbie.”</span></p> <p><span>Elsewhere in the interview, London says that the choice to put same-sex relationships in those early games wasn’t even meant to be the act of a “band of fearless social revolutionaries,” but was merely seen as a reflection of the human experience the team sought to emulate in </span><i><span>The Sims</span></i><span>, without which the game would have been telling a “lie.”</span></p> <p><span>“I think it goes beyond the sexual,” London said. “The answer I gave actually is applicable to, I think, as many of the decisions we could have possibly made in </span><i><span>The Sims</span></i><span> where we are agnostic and where we leave room for player choice. </span><i><span>The Sims</span></i><span> must remain [agnostic] for it to be successful, it must remain a faithful canvas on which the player is free to project the story that, to them, is important and emotionally impactful.</span></p> <p><span>“And that includes not just sexuality, it includes body image, it includes race, and it includes the choice of clothing. It includes the choice of architecture, the choice of job, structure, all the magnificent diversity of actual human life, and this is something that the team, I think, deeply understands.”</span></p> <p><span>At the moment, EA asserts that its “values and [its] commitment to players and fans around the world remain unchanged,” but given the pending new ownership, fans are skeptical. The Saudi Arabian government has made several attempts to latch onto the video game industry in an attempt at </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/evo-saudi-arabia-street-fighter-6-sony-esports-2000622367"><span>“sportswashing” the dire state of its human rights laws</span></a><span>, which include the criminalization of same-sex acts, marriage, and cross-dressing. If someone in a position of power at EA says that developers are no longer allowed to implement queer characters and storylines, there’s no guarantee that </span><i><span>Mass Effect 5 </span></i><span>or a future </span><i><span>Sims </span></i><span>project will include them in the future. Hopefully, someone at EA hears what London is saying and fights back against any such regulation. It would be a real fucking shame if these series with storied queer history weren’t allowed to maintain it in the future.</span></p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/after-confusing-driver-release-amd-says-old-gpus-are-still-actively-supported.1342678/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
          
          
<p>The release notes for the 25.10.2 Adrenalin release also dropped Windows 10 from the list of “compatible operating systems,” listing only Windows 11 21H2 and later. But AMD <a href="https://www.windowslatest.com/2025/10/31/amd-confirms-its-not-ending-windows-10-support-says-windows-11-installer-will-work-on-windows-10/">confirmed</a> to Windows Latest that the driver packages would still support Windows 10 for the foreseeable future. The company said that the OS is not listed in the release notes because Microsoft has technically ended support for Windows 10, but home users running Windows 10 on their PCs can <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/10/windows-10-support-ends-today-but-its-just-the-first-of-many-deaths/">get an extra year of security patches</a> relatively easily. Microsoft will continue to provide support for the OS in businesses, schools, and other large organizations <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/04/post-2025-windows-10-updates-for-businesses-start-at-61-per-pc-go-up-from-there/">until at least 2028</a>.</p>
<h2>Why all the fuss?</h2>
<p>It would look bad if AMD dropped or reduced support for those Radeon 5000- and 6000-series GPUs, given that Nvidia continues to support GeForce RTX 20- and 30-series graphics cards launched in the same 2019 to 2022 time window. But the end of support could have been even worse for gaming handhelds and lower-end PCs with integrated graphics.</p>
<p>The RDNA 2 architecture, in particular, has enjoyed a long and ongoing life as an integrated GPU, including for systems that are explicitly marketed and sold as gaming PCs. And because so many of AMD and Intel’s lower-end chips are just <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2025/10/amd-shores-up-its-budget-laptop-cpus-by-renaming-more-years-old-silicon/">rebranded versions of older silicon</a>, AMD continues to launch “new” products with RDNA 2 GPUs. The RDNA 2 architecture is the one Valve has used in the Steam Deck since 2022, for example, but Microsoft and Asus’ <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/10/rog-xbox-ally-x-the-ars-technica-review/">just-launched</a> ROG Xbox Ally series <a href="https://www.amd.com/en/products/processors/handhelds/ryzen-z-series/z2-series/z2-a.html">also includes an RDNA 2 GPU</a> in the entry-level model.</p>
<p>The last time AMD formally scaled back its GPU driver support was <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/11/amd-pulls-back-on-drivers-for-aging-but-popular-graphics-cards-and-igpus/">in 2023</a>, when it moved drivers for its Polaris and Vega GPU architectures into a separate package that would only get occasional “critical updates.” At the time, AMD had launched its last dedicated Vega-based GPU just four years before, and many lower-end desktop and laptop processors still shipped with Vega-based integrated GPUs.</p>
<p>For the Steam Deck and other SteamOS and Linux systems, at least, it seems that things aren’t really changing, no matter what happens with the Windows drivers. Phoronix <a href="https://www.phoronix.com/news/AMD-Windows-RX-5000-6000-Game">points out</a> that the Linux driver package for AMD’s GPUs has always been maintained separately from the Windows drivers and that GPU architectures considerably older than RDNA 1 continue to get official support and occasional improvements.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>There are fantasy games about knights fighting dragons or a mayor building a town, but there is an even more honorable profession that is often overlooked: the tavern keeper. In this&nbsp;<em>Tavern Keeper</em>&nbsp;preview, I'll explore a new tavern management simulator that is a lot more challenging than it looks at first glance.</p>

<p><a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="074ae8fb-5c20-4715-96ad-96d3239ede91" href="https://techraptor.net/games/tavern-keeper" rel="nofollow"><em>Tavern Keeper</em></a>&nbsp;is the long-awaited sophomore title from&nbsp;<em>Game Dev Tycoon</em>&nbsp;developer&nbsp;Greenheart Games. We've <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/greenheart-games-announces-tavern-keeper" rel="nofollow">waited nearly ten years</a>&nbsp;for it to arrive, and now it's finally here. I was excited to see how&nbsp;<em>Tavern Keeper</em>&nbsp;turned out after all this time, and I can confidently say this: it was definitely worth the wait.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/tavern-keeper-preview-starting-the-tavern-keeper-preview-in-riverbottom-with-the-first-tavern.jpg?itok=b-bFtwjw 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/tavern-keeper-preview-starting-the-tavern-keeper-preview-in-riverbottom-with-the-first-tavern.jpg?itok=4F3eKmxX 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>You don't have much room (or much money) in your first tavern, but it's enough to get started.</figcaption></figure><h2>Surviving the Swamp</h2>

<p>Your adventure as a tavern keeper begins in the murky swamps of Riverbottom. This isn't a metaphor, really; your first tavern is literally smack dab in the middle of a swamp. You've decided to try to turn things around and build a working business in the ruins of an abandoned tavern.</p>

<p>The <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="1a361ff1-c666-4fd4-820d-bcc100274c63" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/guides/tavern-keeper-guide-beginner-tips-and-tricks" rel="nofollow">first few days</a> are pretty dodgy; you have enough money to build <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="7505bb65-ecba-4be8-871f-b3baed27fc8b" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/guides/tavern-keeper-building-guide-how-to-build-tavern" rel="nofollow">the bare necessities of a tavern</a> and hire a single <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="6dca68a7-2bd6-4c3a-b296-bb14d4fbde37" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/guides/tavern-keeper-employees" rel="nofollow">employee</a>. If you manage your money well, you'll make a small but steady profit each day. That money, in turn, can be reinvested into expanding your tavern, buying new stock and equipment, and hiring more employees.</p>

<p>There's more to&nbsp;<em>Tavern Keeper</em>&nbsp;than just managing your money, though. Just like real-world eateries, your tavern has a star rating. A higher star rating will unlock new rooms (such as the Kitchen) and new furniture items, allowing you to provide more services to your customers.</p>

<p>You'll need this new gear, too — a higher star rating also brings more customers and higher tiers of customers. More customers means you'll have to build more tables, hire more employees, and increase the variety and amount of <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="dcfa5593-cf14-4808-ae43-cdd162559c0b" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/guides/tavern-keeper-cooking-and-drinks" rel="nofollow">food and drink</a> you have available.</p>

<p>Stars serve as the objectives in freeplay, but the scenarios will have different objectives altogether, along with some special mechanics. Successfully complete all of the objectives, and you'll be able to move on to managing a much larger tavern in another region.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/tavern-keeper-preview-the-beginning-of-the-halfington-map-in-tavern-keeper.jpg?itok=oIVpcHT- 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/tavern-keeper-preview-the-beginning-of-the-halfington-map-in-tavern-keeper.jpg?itok=xWvwg5r3 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>A mysterious fire destroyed the tavern in Halfington, and it's up to you to rise from the ashes.</figcaption></figure><h2>Onward to Stranger Lands</h2>

<p>Riverbottom effectively serves as the tutorial for&nbsp;<em>Tavern Keeper</em>. Even if you opt out of the guided tutorial, you're only scratching the surface of what you can do in&nbsp;<em>Tavern Keeper</em>. Your next stop is <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="462d4cbc-647d-4d03-9d79-9c56dd1ccbd3" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/guides/tavern-keeper-harvest-festival-walkthrough" rel="nofollow">Halfington</a>, the homeland of the halflings — and your new tavern which had mysteriously burned down before your arrival.</p>

<p>Halflington gives you much more space to work with, but it also comes with some restrictions: unmovable indoor walls shape and restrict the internal structure of your tavern. This somewhat limits your building layout, but you can work around it (and even use the internal walls to your advantage) if you're creative.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>The optional challenges add some welcome replayability to the second and third scenarios.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The second scenario also introduces new optical objectives called "challenges." Based on my experience with Halfington and <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="6c56b2aa-2705-4868-92d2-af5ad31bb949" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/guides/tavern-keeper-orcish-ambitions-walkthrough" rel="nofollow">the third scenario in Gugamush</a>, these challenges require you to use a specialized scenario if you want to complete them.</p>

<p><a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="337e3a62-d7b4-4915-89a5-62492adc8779" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/guides/tavern-keeper-best-in-show-challenge" rel="nofollow">Halfington's "Best in Show" challenge</a>, for example, requires you to win a best guild competition by earning votes from groups of customers. Groups can arrive at any time of day, so your best strategy is to have your tavern open 24 hours a day. That means you'll need double the staff of a normal tavern.</p>

<p>As for <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="c92d8b66-c380-48a1-9e40-aed856226284" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/guides/tavern-keeper-accountant-challenge" rel="nofollow">Gugamush's "Accountant" challenge</a>, you must not take any loans whatsoever. This is complicated by the fact that your first employee asks you to give him back pay for the time he spent working in the tavern while it was abandoned. Both of these challenges add some welcome replayability to the second and third scenarios.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/tavern-keeper-preview-the-unremovable-walls-in-halfington-in-tavern-keeper.jpg?itok=X0TNelRc 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/tavern-keeper-preview-the-unremovable-walls-in-halfington-in-tavern-keeper.jpg?itok=or5cNTQg 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Some of the internal walls in Halflington can't be removed; on the other side, they serve as excellent mounting points for lights and decorations.</figcaption></figure><h2>Cramped Corridors</h2>

<p>There's more to running a tavern than simply hiring employees and keeping the storeroom filled with booze, mind — you have to actually build the tavern. This is an area where&nbsp;<em>Tavern Keeper</em>&nbsp;diverges from some other games in this vague genre of business simulation: each scenario has a fixed tavern layout.</p>

<p>As I said earlier, the Halfington scenario has these positively annoying supporting walls running through parts of the tavern. The Gugamush scenario has its own strange quirk; the center of your tavern counts as an outdoor area. Gugamush's central courtyard breaks up the floor plan of your tavern, but it does give you a handy spot for an outhouse.</p>

<p>This is one of my bigger pain points with&nbsp;<em>Tavern Keeper</em>. I enjoy having room to lay things out with few obstructions, but it can be challenging to get everything set up just right, and you'll often have to make compromises with your tavern design.</p>

<p>The difficulties of laying out your tavern are exacerbated by the need to provide light and control temperatures. All light sources shoot out embers in a particular radius, and having furniture too close to these lighting sources massively increases your risk of a fire. The same applies to stoves and hearths which are needed to warm up colder maps.</p>

<p>In effect, actually building out your tavern is a balancing act between furniture placement, lighting, and heat (or cooling). You also have to consider pathfinding; you don't want to have too large a distance between your bar, kitchen, and storeroom; customers actually have a patience meter, and it's bad if they aren't served quickly.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/tavern-keeper-preview-ordering-drinks-from-barons-brewery-in-tavern-keeper.jpg?itok=7ydafBnD 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/tavern-keeper-preview-ordering-drinks-from-barons-brewery-in-tavern-keeper.jpg?itok=xTgfVMcb 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Some food and drink deliveries can take half a day (or more!) to actually arrive at your tavern.</figcaption></figure><h2>Supplying Demanding Customers</h2>

<p>Lest we forget, there's a little more to running a tavern than building the place and hiring employees; you'll also need food and drink to serve them. Keeping a steady supply of goods in your storeroom is a little more challenging than you might think at first glance.</p>

<p>Anything you'd want to serve to your customers has to be delivered from breweries and markets. The brewery in Halfington, for example, takes around 14 hours to deliver an order (unless you choose fast shipping, which costs more); there are similar time constraints for food markets, and these delivery times increase if the market is far away.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em>Tavern Keeper</em>&nbsp;has a lot of helpful tooltips and built-in guides, but it still falls short on explaining some mechanics here and there.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>What this means in practical terms is that you'll usually have to order your food and drink a few hours before opening or the night before. Extreme cases such as the market in Gugamush or distant markets in other regions might have delivery times of 24 hours or longer.</p>

<p>Finally — and perhaps most importantly — customers of different races have different tastes. Orcs prefer one type of food and drink, and halfings prefer something else altogether. Having something is better than nothing in a pinch, but supplying customers with their favored food and drink does wonders for your tavern's ratings.</p>

<p>I love this mechanic — there are many games in this subgenre that don't put this much thought into the food and drink you're serving. What I didn't like, however, was that it wasn't explained as well as it could have been.&nbsp;<em>Tavern Keeper</em>&nbsp;has a lot of helpful tooltips and built-in guides, but it still falls short on explaining some mechanics here and there.</p>

<p>I spent the better part of 120 hours exploring&nbsp;<em>Tavern Keeper</em>. While it has its rough edges here and there, I had a lot of fun trying to work out the best way to complete the objectives and playing with a tavern in free play.</p>

<p><em>Tavern Keeper</em> has a solid amount of content for an Early Access launch with 1 tutorial scenario and 2 full scenarios with optional objectives; you can also freeplay the maps with variant layouts or customized rulesets if you so choose. If you enjoy this genre, you'll easily have 40+ hours of content to play at the Early Access launch.</p>

<p>As with all Early Access games, though, the value proposition of&nbsp;<em>Tavern Keeper</em>&nbsp;depends on how quickly they can get content updates out the door.&nbsp;<em>Tavern Keeper</em>&nbsp;has a rock-solid foundation and great game mechanics, so here's hoping we won't have to wait too long to play some more.</p>

                <p>Fantastic Pixel Castle, the NetEase-owned MMO studio founded by former <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/world-of-warcraft/" data-ref-id="5000-3919">World of Warcraft</a> lead system designer Greg Street, will shut down November 17.</p><p dir="ltr">Street announced the studio's closure date in a post on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/greg-street-b356447_fantastic-pixel-castle-will-close-its-doors-activity-7391147465636397057-0xA6/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">LinkedIn</a>. In weeks prior, Street stated NetEase had pulled funding from the studio but had allowed it time to seek out a new publisher or raise funding for their fledgling MMORPG, project Ghost.</p><p dir="ltr">Those efforts have not panned out. Street said "there is still a chance" the studio could secure needed funding and live on, but that it will also depend on how much of the current team will choose to remain should that happen.</p><p dir="ltr">"While we'd love to make our game, our first priority is to help our developers find employment, whether that's at indie studio Fantastic Pixel Castle 2.0, or at many of the other fine (and hopefully stable) game and tech companies out there," Street said.</p><p dir="ltr">Fantastic Pixel Castle had recently hosted a number of content creators to stream a first public look at project Ghost gameplay. The game was still in its early stages, with Fantastic Pixel Castle having been fairly transparent about its development process.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C-lfbPENg3I" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C-lfbPENg3I" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">The studio believed recent MMOs have put too much of a focus on solo adventuring and sought to emphasize playing with friends and building an online community, according to the studio's <a href="https://fantasticpixelcastle.com/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">website</a>. As for how Ghost would have played, it was a class-based MMORPG that was divided into two different experiences called Red and Blue Shards. Blue Shard areas would have played more like a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-survival-horror-games/2900-7150/" data-ref-id="2900-7150">survival game</a>, where friends could party up to gather resources, build bases, and adventure together. Red Shards featured more classic MMORPG experiences, where large groups of players could team together to fight world bosses or impact the game's world in permanent ways.</p><p dir="ltr">Before forming Fantastic Pixel Castle, Street served at Blizzard as a lead systems designer on WoW for nearly six years, later joining Riot Games. There he held a number of different roles, the last of which was overseeing Riot's first MMO. He left Riot in 2023, and about a year later Riot announced it was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/riot-hits-reset-on-league-of-legends-mmo-with-no-news-for-years-to-come/1100-6522053/" data-ref-id="1100-6522053">hitting reset on its League of Legends MMO</a>, going back to the drawing board after several years of development.</p><p dir="ltr">Fantastic Pixel Castle's closure is just the latest in a long line of layoffs and studio shutterings in 2025, including <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/all-the-xbox-games-cancelled-and-studios-closed-in-microsofts-latest-mass-layoffs/2900-6726/" data-ref-id="2900-6726">major layoffs at Xbox</a>. Early this year, NetEase made headlines when it <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marvel-rivals-devs-laid-off-despite-the-games-huge-success/1100-6529559/" data-ref-id="1100-6529559">laid off Marvel Rivals US-based development team</a> despite the game's huge success. A <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marvel-rivals-layoffs-at-us-team-influenced-in-part-by-geopolitical-risks-analyst-says/1100-6529611/" data-ref-id="1100-6529611">report</a> at the time indicated the Chinese-gaming giant was looking to scale back its overseas game business due to "geopolitical risks" and a "recalibration of its global strategy."</p>
