            <p>
Video games don't have mysteries any more. There are too many people and too much internet to allow for such a thing, anything without an answer can, must, and will be solved by someone, often in a timeframe faster than developers expect. So I appreciate when developers refuse to divulge details, or indulge individuals in their desire to know exactly how much they have on their checklist, one such developer being Tonda Ros of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-blue-prince">Blue Prince</a> developer Dogubomb.
</p>
<p>
In response to a question from <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/puzzle/i-will-probably-never-fully-acknowledge-whether-or-not-everything-has-been-solved-says-blue-prince-creator-there-are-certainly-mysteries-still-in-the-game/">PC Gamer</a> regarding whether there are any mysteries left to be found in the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-puzzle-games">puzzle</a> game, Ros said that there certainly are, and that "there will probably always be some mysteries in the game. And in order to preserve that mystery, I will probably never fully acknowledge whether or not everything has been solved." Music to my ears!
</p>
<p>
Ros goes further, saying, "I know that for some games, they'll have, like, a canary in the coal mine, right? I think it's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/animal-well">Animal Well</a> that has a website that's like, 'Has everything been found yet?' That kind of serves as a canary." As it turns out, such a website does exist, it's <a href="http://haseverythinginanimalwellbeenfoundyet.com/">haseverythinginanimalwellbeenfoundyet.com</a>, and I'll let you click to find out what the answer is.
</p>
<p>
For Ros, that question of whether everything has been found in Blue Prince is one he thinks people will always ask. "The only thing I will say is that there are still mysteries," he said. "Not to say that they're necessarily things that can be solved in definitive ways, but they are things that you can piece together answers to, oftentimes intuitively."
</p><p>
I truly hope this is something we see more of from developers going forwards. There is such a massive inclination towards complete and utter player satisfaction, but to me there is nothing more satisfying than to be left wanting more, a reason to keep coming back, even if the gaps between return trips end up being days, weeks, months or years at a time. Lay unto me your mysterious developers! I may not solve them, but I will think about them.
</p>
<p>
And while you're here, I'd like to remind you that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-team-behind-blue-prince-puts-out-a-call-to-get-one-of-the-puzzle-games-devs-a-life-saving-kidney">one of the lead playtesters on Blue Prince is in desperate need of a kidney</a>, something you genuinely might be able to help with.

            <p>Escape from Tarkov is sitting on a Mostly Negative rating today after yesterday's eagerly-awaited Steam debuted to stability and performance issues that prevent players even logging in, let alone play.</p>
<p>Acknowledging that players are experiencing "problems connecting to the servers and authorising in the game launcher", developer Battlestate said its "technical team is actively working to stabilise the game servers and authorisation services" and apologised for any inconvenience caused.</p>

<p>It hasn't stopped thousands of unhappy people leaving negative reviews, though, with just 34% of the 7200+ reviews left since yesterday's launch reporting a positive experience. Some claim that they <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561199734556695/recommended/3932890/">can't even create an account"</a> due to connection issues and ongoing server/website maintenance.</p><p>"Escape from Tarkov is not a game.

"Booting it up is like willingly inserting your face into a malfunctioning wood chipper. Nothing makes sense. Hit registration behaves completely random. The sound doesn't work, everyone moves absolutely silently. Bosses and Scavs walk through doors like they don't exist. Players are plunged into despair the moment another server error occurs.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>After a lot of negative feedback and tumbling player counts, Bungie have acknowledged that they made some poor decisions with Destiny 2. Here is their statement from this week’s TWAB.</p>
<p><em>“With Edge of Fate, we presented a different vision for the future of Destiny 2’s core game. One intended to refocus our releases and player call-to-action on a familiar but deeper pursuit of Power and ascending to higher Tiers of gear across a wider range of activities supporting customizable challenge and commensurate rewards. &nbsp;</em></p>


<p><em>Very quickly, the feedback made it clear that this was the wrong path for Destiny.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>Even if our execution had been perfect, and we see plainly that it was not, it is clear that grinding Power will never be a substitute for earning a trophy. Climbing through throwaway tiers en-route to the gear you want to build around isn’t aspirational. And the Portal itself surrenders too much of Destiny’s feeling of place and exploration. These lessons, and many others besides them, have been taken to heart by our team over the last three months.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><em>From 9.0.0 on through 9.1.5, our focus across the entire team has been response to player feedback, starting with the fastest changes and working through the more challenging ones. Our focus was on faster, better Rewards, more player agency in activity choice, and removing barriers to playing with friends.</em></p>

<p><em>Since Destiny launched over ten years ago, it has always been a living, reactive world. Through our successes and failures, we are grateful for the opportunities to explore different paths, learn from them, and with that clarity, build an inspiring new vision with, and for, our players. As we work on our plans and communications to address your feedback, thank you for being on this journey with us as we reshape our strategy for the long-term future of the Destiny franchise. “</em></p>
<p>The Portal and the associated power grind had come under heavy criticism as it required players to play the same few activities over and over again just to raise their power levels up before they could start getting decent weapon drops. This meant playing other activities, such as Dares of Eternity was completely pointless, and if you did, the matchmaking was unlikely to find any other players.</p>
<p>Updates 9.5.0 (December 2) and 9.5.0.1 (December 9) will begin to make changes to how the game works.</p>
<ul>
<li>Wider access to Power progression, especially in Expansion content.
<ul>
<li>Players will be able to reach the Power cap directly through Renegades activities if they wish.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Seasonal Power and Featured Gear carrying across Seasons.
<ul>
<li>All Exotic weapons and armor are now featured.</li>
<li>Additionally, we’re moving Power catch-up from a chest needing manual pickup to organic drops: sign in, play Renegades, catapult to 300 Power, and play with your friends.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Vault capacity and upgrades to ease collection pressure.
<ul>
<li>We have increased Vault capacity by an additional 300 slots to 1000, and we’re working on more.</li>
<li>In addition, the Vault now has a revamped filtering system to help find what you’re looking for faster.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Renegades looks fun so I will be re-joining the Guardians when it launches, will you?</p>

			<p>Escape from Tarkov is finally live on Steam with its long-anticipated 1.0 release. To celebrate the occasion, <a href="https://wccftech.com/escape-from-tarkov-1-0-launch-qa-we-have-big-plans/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">we brought you an exclusive interview with Nikita Buyanov</a>, Game Director of Battlestate Games, discussing the long journey toward the full launch, the content available in this new version, some of what will be coming in the future, and a few thoughts on the genre as a whole.</p>



<p>Additionally, we also inquired about controller support for the PC version and about a potential launch on console platforms. Here's what Buyanov told us:</p>



<p><em>Yes, we are considering the possibility of porting the game to consoles. I think when we start working on it, we will implement full controller support. It's a very serious and interesting game design challenge – to create comfortable controls while accounting for all of Tarkov's unique mechanics.</em></p>



<p>It does sound like this is still further away, since the studio hasn't even begun working on it yet. It may be quite a while, considering how long it took Battlestate Games to release Escape from Tarkov. Still, it's good news for all those who'd love to play it on consoles, or at least to play it on PC, but with the comfort of a gamepad.</p>

<p>Exclusive in-game rewards will be given to beta test participants and players who placed a pre-order. These rewards are permanent and will not be deleted during profile resets. The items are credited automatically.</p>



<p>The game's launch also coincides with a new Twitch Drops campaign. From now through December 6 at 11:30 GMT/06:30 EST, viewers of streams in the Escape from Tarkov category will receive unboxable containers containing items of varying rarity levels, along with other rewards, at specific intervals.

            <p>
I do have to admit that bringing up <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/concord">Concord</a> feels like digging up a dead dog that perished in a horrendous, preventable accident, but it feels important given how quickly it died and what the means for how we engage with it. You see, it seems that this week the largely panned hero <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">shooter</a> was revived through community-run custom servers. Except it seems like this may be over before it truly begins.
</p>
<p>
As reported by <a href="https://thegamepost.com/sony-concord-playable-again-custom-servers/">The Game Post</a>, developers that go by the names Red, open_wizard, and gwog opened up a Discord server where you could try out Concord through said custom servers. This is apparently possible through the trio recreating the game's backend API and thusly reverse engineering it. Some videos were even posted to YouTube showing off these custom servers in action, which is where things have started to go legally iffy.
</p>
<p>
Both videos, as again reported by <a href="https://thegamepost.com/sony-cracks-down-concord-custom-servers-dmca-takedowns/">The Game Post</a>, were taken down through a copyright claim filed by MarkScan Enforcement, most likely on Sony's behalf. I say most likely, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/nightmare-kart-is-getting-a-free-dlc-but-sonys-plague-ridden-rats-have-come-for-bloodborne-psx">as MarkScan did the exact same thing to Bloodborne PSX</a> on behalf of Sony earlier this year. It's not surprising the same thing has been done to Concord here, especially as the custom servers won't have much legal ground to stand on.
</p>
<p>
It should be noted that these takedowns are for the videos themselves. So far nothing seems to have been done about the custom servers themselves, but in a statement in the Discord for the project, developer Red said "Due to worrying legal action we’ve decided to pause invites for the time being." At the time of writing, any links to the Discord server no longer work.
</p><p>
This all feels pertinent to the ongoing situation with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/stop-killing-games-uk-petition-has-been-debated-in-parliament-the-law-works-but-companies-may-need-to-communicate-better">Stop Killing Games</a>, a campaign that seeks to "challenge the legality of publishers destroying video games they have sold to customers." Personally, I don't love the consumerist angle to the campaign, but there is something to be said of the need to protect online-only games from certain doom. 
</p>
<p>
Games like Concord are toys, you smash action figures together in them for ridiculous results, yet you can only do it in the way you've been told to. That stinks! I often think of the success of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/team-fortress-2">Team Fortress 2</a> in particular, and the playful space Valve created with it that allowed for many a machinima. That feels like more important a reason to preserve online games, to allow for a freer sense of play once the corporate overlords have stopped making money from their toy business. Let's see how things play out for new, slightly less legal Concord.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>New <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/first-the-legend-of-zelda-movie-footage-has-reportedly-leaked/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">leaked set footage</a> of The Legend of Zelda movie may show who is playing an iconic character in the franchise. Furthermore, it’s done by one of TV’s biggest stars from Severance.</p>







<p>With <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/super-mario-bros-movie-record-breaking/">The Super Mario Bros</a>. Movie in 2023 and the upcoming Super Mario Galaxy film, Nintendo is on quite a roll with films. Its blockbuster sales at the Box Office proved that bringing its IPs to theaters can work if done well. The company’s next project is a highly ambitious live-action adaptation of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-legend-of-zelda-is-finally-getting-a-movie/">The Legend of Zelda</a>. Directed by The Maze Runner’s Wes Ball, the film is set to release on May 7th, 2027. The film has cast <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/link-and-zelda-actors-confirmed-nintendo-legend-of-zelda/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Link and Zelda</a>, but the rest of the cast has yet to be revealed. With filming underway, the process has been done and, with a new video leak, we may know who’s playing one of Zelda’s biggest supporters.</p>



<h2 id="h-severance-star-may-be-playing-impa-in-the-legend-of-zelda-leak-hints">Severance Star May Be Playing Impa in The Legend of Zelda, Leak Hints&nbsp;</h2>

</div></figure>



<p>In <a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DRCALkNk0Nl/?igsh=MW40OGJvOXRqamx0Zw%3D%3D" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the leaked video on Instagram</a>, a figure can be seen lecturing Zelda and granting her a sword. As we only know Link and Zelda’s actors, seeing a new person on set does indicate more has been added. With them lecturing Zelda, one could assume the character is Impa, Zelda’s Sheikan guardian. Given that some versions of the character can range in age, it seems the film could be taking notes from the younger version shown in Ocarina of Time and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment-release-date-direct/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hyrule Warriors</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Still, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/zelda/comments/1oxjpdt/movie_there_is_leaked_footage_of_the_zelda_movie/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">fans on Reddit were quick</a> to point out that the actress in the Legend of Zelda movie video leak looked strikingly familiar to Severance’s Dichen Lachman, who played counselor Ms. Casey in the popular Apple TV+ series. The actress has grown into a household name with Severance, as well as big roles in Neighbors, Jurassic World Dominion, and in the upcoming second season of Netflix’ The Last Airbender.&nbsp;Interestingly enough, the actress did star in Wes Ball’s last film, Kingdom of the Planet of the Apes.&nbsp;Regardless, no official confirmation has been made on the casting, so take it and the leak with a grain of salt. However, if the fans’ reactions are proof enough, the actress would be perfect as Impa.</p>







<p>What do you think of The Legend of Zelda movie leak? Think Dichen Lachman is Impa? Another character? What do you make of the leaks? Let us know in the comments and on&nbsp;<a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the official Insider Gaming Discord</a>!</p>

            <p>Our first look at the cast of the live-action Legend of Zelda movie has leaked online.</p>
<p>Captured in New Zealand, the video appears to show the cast in action, and while we can't hear anything meaningful, we do get a glimpse at Bo Bragason as the titular Zelda.</p>
<p>A separate snippet, presumably taken at or near the same time, also showsm Benjamin Evan Ainsworth as Link, too, complete in his signature green outfit. You can check it out below:</p>

<p>Last week things moved forward with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/as-the-project-begins-production-it-looks-like-the-legend-of-zelda-film-is-following-in-lord-of-the-rings-esteemed-footsteps">the live-action Legend of Zelda film, which has now commenced production</a>. It follows in the footsteps of esteemed movies and shows like Peter Jackson's Lord of the Rings series by filming in Wellington, New Zealand.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, it was announced that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-reveals-its-link-and-zelda-for-forthcoming-the-legend-of-zelda-film">Link and Princess Zelda will be played by Benjamin Evan Ainsworth and Bo Bragason</a>, respectively, in the upcoming adaptation, which is currently set for release in 2027.</p>
<p>ICYMI, Nintendo and Lego recently teased a new set based on The Legend of Zelda, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/looks-like-legos-next-the-legend-of-zelda-set-will-be-based-on-ocarina-of-time">which looks to be based on Ocarina of Time</a>.</p>

            <p>
The leads behind the, potentially surprisingly, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/why-is-superhero-comedy-dispatch-a-million-selling-success-story-it-could-be-that-weekly-release-schedule">hit superhero game</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dispatch">Dispatch</a>, AdHoc Studio, have been all over the place. Telltale Games, Ubisoft, Night School Studio, some pretty notable names, but today we're honing in on their time at Ubisoft in particular. That's because a recent report that dives into the long story that led AdHoc to making Dispatch revealed that before doing so, they were working on a completely new <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/splinter-cell">Splinter Cell</a> game at Ubisoft.
</p>
<p>
Nick Herman, one of the co-founders of AdHoc, shared said detail with <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-11-14/the-turbulent-seven-year-saga-behind-hit-game-dispatch?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc2MzE0MzM2NiwiZXhwIjoxNzYzNzQ4MTY2LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJUNVFBMDdHUEZIUlYwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.fNOncm0D1BfbWI9RAgwCB6j8SI8mW9RhRD76EEz1TYo&amp;leadSource=uverify%20wall">Bloomberg</a>, saying that he was "so excited to be a part of this and help revitalize it, because it’s been dormant for a while. And we thought we could tell a great story and do something the fans would love." Obviously this game never materialised, and according to Herman it was partially due to the whims of executives at the time.
</p>
<p>
This was back in 2017, a time when Ubisoft was gaining interest in live service games, and so this new Splinter Cell game just didn't fit into that vision. "We tried," Herman said. "Let’s make a narrative GAAS game. We were trying to make that make sense, and a lot of cool prototypes were made." Nothing they did try worked, apparently, but eventually it somehow morphed into <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/tom-clancys-xdefiant">xDefiant</a>, though this was post the AdHoc team forming.
</p>
<p>
If you need a reminder, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ubisoft-shut-down-multiplayer-shooter-xdefiant-and-lay-off-hundreds-who-worked-on-it">xDefiant was shut down only a year after it was released</a>, resulting in mass layoffs. It also started life as a Tom Clancy game, so you can see the Splinter Cell connection at least.
</p>
<p>
It's probably worth noting that xDefiant producer Mark Rubin commented on his personal Dwitter account regarding this report from Bloomberg, <a href="https://x.com/PixelsofMark/status/1989545807247487122">claiming it wasn't true</a>, and that the shooter had never started life as a Splinter Cell game. However, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jasonschreier.bsky.social/post/3m5oad3lxlc25">as pointed by the author of said Bloomberg report Jason Schreier</a>, Rubin joined Ubisoft in 2019, two years after the Dispatch team was working on Splinter Cell. So, yes, the folks that made Dispatch were working on a Splinter Cell game once upon a time, as long as nobody is lying to us, and if they are, please don't shoot me (the fabled messenger).

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Concord has gone down in infamy as an all-time Sony and PlayStation blunder. It’s also understandable that the company wants to sweep the game’s existence under the rug, which is why Sony has presumably and swiftly issued DMCAs notices to gameplay videos of a fan-inspired Concord reboot, causing access to the game to be halted.</p>



<p>We don’t think much needs to be said about Concord at this point. The live-service shooter apparently <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/concord-cost-over-400-million-to-develop-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cost over $400 million to develop</a>, the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/breaking-concord-developer-firewalk-studios-shut-down-by-sony/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">team behind it was quickly shut down by Sony</a>, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/breaking-playstation-shutting-down-concord/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PlayStation took Concord offline within days of launch</a>.</p>



<p>Now, a community effort to resurrect the game has been met with strong action.</p>







<h2 id="h-sony-issues-dmcas-to-concord-pc-revival">Sony Issues DMCAs To Concord PC Revival</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Burn it down. Credit to Sony</figcaption></figure>



<p>We reported on November 14 that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/concord-pc-fan-made-multiplayer-playstation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Concord got a playable fan-made revival on PC</a>. Users cleverly managed to get custom Concord servers up and running—requiring special access to let you play.</p>



<p>What seemed like innocent fun has quickly turned into the gaze of Sony being cast upon them.</p>



<p>A dev post in the Concord Delta Discord updated everyone on a serious development:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“Due to worrying legal action we’ve decided to pause invites for the time being.”</p>
</blockquote>







<p>It transpires that gameplay videos of the Concord project had made their way to YouTube. DMCA action was immediately imposed by MarkScan—a name that works a lot on Sony’s behalf. If you add the facts up, it’s fairly obvious to see what’s happened.</p>



<p>As a result, the Concord PC project and servers are on hold, and unless something drastic changes, it probably means Sony is once again responsible for the death of Concord.</p>



<p>Is it better that we all move on from Concord at this point? Or is it a shame to see a handful of people who cared about the short-lived shooter have their hard work up in flmaes? The <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1433093283558719611/1433112738133180426" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Discord Server</a> is the perfect place to share your thoughts.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/possessor-s-is-a-fast-paced-action-game-that-gets-off-to-a-slow-start.1354693/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>I remember being blown away by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eFd32M4-muA">the 2024 reveal trailer</a> for <em>Possessor(s)</em>, the new game from <em>Hyper Light Drifter</em> developer Heart Machine. The trailer features a striking art design, where an animated 2D character explores and fights in side-scrolling environments with gorgeous 3D backgrounds, and it’s all set to moody, powerful music. The final game, which came out this month, wasn’t quite as awe-inspiring as that initial trailer made it seem, and I almost quit it — but I’m really glad I saw it to the end.</p><p>In <em>Possessor(s)</em>, you play as Luca, a girl who is possessed by Rehm, a demon from another realm. After a catastrophe strikes, Rehm saves Luca’s life by creating legs for her — but from then on, Luca serves as a host for Rhem, meaning they can talk to each other all the time and occasionally see into each other’s memories. The two have a contentious relationship. They bicker <em>constantly</em>, which sometimes made them difficult for me to care about. But over the course of the game, their relationship evolves as they come to understand more about each other and the worlds they came from.</p><div><p><figcaption><em>Luca (left) and Rhem (right).</em></figcaption></p></div><p>Heart Machine describes <em>Possessor(s)</em> as a “fast-paced action side scroller,” but this is a <em>Metroid</em>- or <em>Castlevania</em>-style game through and through. You’ll explore an interconnected world with distinct zones, spend a lot of time looking at the map to try and find the next path to explore, and collect helpful traversal upgrades like a wall run to help you access new areas. Very early on, you’ll pick up a whip, and it serves double duty as an exploration tool to cross large gaps and a key weapon in battle.</p><p>Fights are <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/platformer/smash-bros-meets-metroidvania-in-possessor-s-heart-machines-new-side-scrolling-opus/">inspired by</a> platform fighters like <em>Super Smash Bros.</em>, meaning they’re fast-paced and crunchy, and you’ll take on enemies with weapons inspired by regular things you might have around your house. My usual strategy consisted of whaling on enemies up close with a large baseball bat, shocking them with an electric blast from a cellphone to create space, and flinging demonic silverware across rooms to hit faraway targets. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/667900/doom-the-dark-ages-clair-obscur-expedition-33-parry-season">Parrying</a> is a key part of fights, too.</p><p>Early on, though, <em>Possessor(s)</em> was <em>very</em> tough. Regular enemies hit hard, and if you lose focus for just a second or get caught in an unlucky combo, you can die without any time to react. Dying sends you back to the <em>Possessor(s)</em> equivalent of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bonfire_(Dark_Souls)"><em>Dark Souls</em> bonfires</a>, but the return trips to where you died can be long, arduous, and filled with danger. (The game also uses a <em>Souls</em>-like flask system, swapping flasks for painkillers to let you recover health.)</p><p>Usually, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22150718/demons-souls-remake-ps5-playstation-5-sony-game-of-the-year-2020">I like that kind of challenge</a>, but something about <em>Possessor(s)</em>’s level and enemy design often made the early game feel more frustrating than fun for me. I also got <em>very</em> lost after the first few hours, exploring way more of the map than I needed to because I couldn’t figure out how to get past some mysterious walls with glowy cracks on them. I contemplated putting down the game for good.</p><p>However, after finally learning how to open those walls (use the whip!), getting a few health and painkiller upgrades, and seeing more nuance to Luca and Rhem’s relationship, I started to enjoy the game much more. I finally settled into the satisfying <em>Metroid</em> loop of exploring a new area, finding a new upgrade, using that to get to the next boss, getting the next MacGuffin, and then doing it all over again in the next zone.</p><p><em>Possessor(s)</em> didn’t possess me in the way that I expected it might. Based on my initial impressions, the game seemed cooked in a lab to appeal to my exact tastes. I just needed to have some patience. The game culminated in a final level that really put my skills to the test and a striking battlefield for the final boss. As I watched the credits roll, I realized it had all finally evoked some of those feelings I had watching the game’s first trailer.</p><p><sup>Possessor(s)</sup><em><sup> is out now on PC and PS5.</sup></em></p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTIz"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Jay Peters</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games/821117/possessors-review-pc-ps5]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-7-season-1-release-maps-zombies/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/black-ops-7-season-1%E2%80%94release-period-all-new-maps-zombies-content-more.1354684/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 Season 1 begins another 12-month content crusade. New maps, guns, game modes, Operators, events, and all the usual hullabaloo that comes with a new CoD season. We have the latest Black Ops 7 Season 1 release information, as well as the known S1 content.</p>



<p>You could argue that this hasn’t been the most hyped CoD in history—<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-7-day-one-steam-numbers-compare-badly-to-battlefield-6-and-arc-raiders/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Steam player numbers</a> would agree. Nevertheless, thousands of players have dived into Black Ops 7, meaning that Season 1 will have its fair share of recruits. If you want to know when <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-season-one-roadmap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">BLOPS 7 Season 1</a> starts, read on for the crucial pointers.</p>







<p>Also, if you haven’t picked up the game yet, or you intend to, we have the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/visit/black-ops-7-loaded-xbox-pc/">cheapest way to buy Black Ops 7</a>.</p>



<h2 id="h-expected-call-of-duty-black-ops-7-season-1-release-date">Expected Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 Season 1 Release Date</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Run for it. Credit to Activision</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>We expect Black Ops 7 Season 1 to kick off on December 4, because it coincides with the end of Black Ops 6 Season 6—Signaling the transition from Black Ops 6’s seasonal content ending and Black Ops 7’s beginning.</strong></p>



<p>If you’ve been in the live-service loop before, you know the drill. Once a previous season ends, the next one begins. BLOPS 7 has a brief period between launch and Season 1 called the ‘preseason’.</p>







<p>We know for sure that the legendary <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nuketown-black-ops-7/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nuketown map</a> is a big addition in the preseason period. Once we cross this barrier, it’s time to move on to Season 1. Treyarch is likely to confirm the Season 1 start date in the coming days, but don’t be surprised to see December 4 as the official start date!</p>



<h2 id="h-expected-call-of-duty-black-ops-7-season-1-start-time">Expected Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 Season 1 Start Time</h2>



<p><strong>Again, based on existing data, Black Ops 7 Season 1 onlookers can expect the new season to begin around 9 AM PT.</strong></p>



<p>This is a simple case of deduction using the end of the Black Ops 6 Season 6 Battle Pass. It’s what happens with all Call of Duty seasons, and we expect Season 1 to be no different.</p>



<p>If this isn’t the case, we’ll update this hub and let you know of any confirmed times, delays, or changes.</p>



<h2 id="h-all-black-ops-7-season-1-multiplayer-amp-zombies-content">All Black Ops 7 Season 1 Multiplayer &amp; Zombies Content</h2>



<figure><figcaption>A lot to take in. Credit to Activision</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Season 1 introduces a whopping 7 multiplayer maps, 7 weapons, remastered content, new multiplayer modes, new LTMs, Holiday season content, and 3 new Zombies maps.</strong></p>



<p>Where do we begin? Let’s start with the Zombies content to mix it up.</p>



<h3 id="h-new-black-ops-7-season-1-zombies-content">New Black Ops 7 Season 1 Zombies Content</h3>



<p>The Season 1 roadmap has confirmed that <strong>Astra Malorum</strong> is a new round-based Zombies map—to add to Ashes of the Damned—and there will also be two additional Survival maps.</p>



<p>We’ve covered all of this and more in our complete <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-black-ops-7-zombies-maps-survival-dead-ops/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Ops 7 Zombies hub</a>.</p>



<p>Zombies fans will be satiated with flesh and fun for the foreseeable future, at least. Knowing Treyarch, there is probably the odd surprise here and there you’ll need to uncover!</p>



<h3 id="h-new-black-ops-7-season-1-multiplayer-content">New Black Ops 7 Season 1 Multiplayer Content</h3>



<p>The main course for most is the multiplayer content. A lot of maps are currently locked in for Season 1, adding to the 18 multiplayer maps that launched with the base game.</p>



<p>Here’s every confirmed map for Season 1 already:</p>



<ul>
<li>Fate</li>



<li>Meltdown</li>



<li>Nuketown (Technically a preseason map)</li>



<li>Odysseus</li>



<li>Standoff (Remaster)</li>



<li>Utopia</li>



<li>Yakei</li>
</ul>



<p>Additionally, 7 “new &amp; fan-favorite weapons” are coming—including the <strong>Maddox</strong> from Black Ops 4—and we don’t quite know what the new game modes and extras entail.</p>



<p>Treyarch will reveal all when the time is right. Stay tuned for more updates on Season 1.</p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Season 01 of <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/BlackOps7?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#BlackOps7</a> will be the biggest post-launch content drop in our history, and we're just getting started. Get your first look in our new Dev Talk:</p><p>✅ 7 signature 6v6 maps<br>✅ 7 new &amp; fan-favorite weapons (Maddox! 😍)<br>✅ 3 Zombies maps<br>✅ S01 remasters confirmed<br>✅ MP… <a href="https://t.co/VoKWLqycLW">pic.twitter.com/VoKWLqycLW</a></p></div>— Treyarch (@Treyarch) <a href="https://twitter.com/Treyarch/status/1981421047376465996?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 23, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>



<p>There’s no doubt that Treyarch is starting strong with Season 1. It’s being touted as the biggest season ever, and you can see why. There’s much more to come, and it’s the first of several BLOPS 7 seasons throughout the year.

This is very much still the case with this fresh release on Switch from Feral Interactive, but now that original developer IO Interactive has righted the ship with the excellent <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hitman-world-of-assassination-signature-edition">World of Assassination</a> trilogy, it’s much easier to look back on Absolution and better appreciate it for what it is – kind of like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/resident_evil_6">Resident Evil 6</a>.</p>
<p>Does that mean it’s perfect? No, far from it. But it’s a fascinating detour for Agent 47 that still provides ample fun while laying foundations for later titles, including the upcoming <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/007-first-light">007 First Light</a>.</p>
<p>Like previous entries, Absolution requires you to locate your targets and dispatch them with as little fuss as possible (while constantly evading the <a href="https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/po-po">po-po</a>). Nailing a high stealth rating is what it’s all about, but if you prefer to go in guns blazing, that’s an option. Otherwise, sneaky little ‘accidents’ are often the best course of action, and you can activate Instinct Mode to highlight enemies, items, and traps to help formulate a plan.</p>
<p>Disguises let you access areas that might otherwise be off-limits, but many of the guards can see through your outfits (not literally, cheeky) and discover your true identity. Instinct Mode comes into play here too, so by holding down ‘R’ while in an enemy's line of sight, you can make yourself inconspicuous enough to slip by.</p>
<p>Unlike World of Assassination, Instinct Mode is finite. Relying on it too much will deplete your supplies. Taking out guards and completing challenges will replenish it, but I advise using it sparingly and instead rely on your own senses to scope out opportunities; it’s much more fun that way.</p>
<p>Levels are overall smaller and more compact than what you might be used to. IO Interactive focuses a lot more on telling a coherent story, and it shows in the structure. In other Hitman titles, you’d spend a lot of time walking out in the open and blending into your surroundings, but in Absolution, sneaking around and hiding behind cover is generally more advisable thanks to the close-quarters environments.</p>
<p>This frustrated a lot of folks back in 2012, and the game was widely criticised for its overall linearity when compared to earlier entries. This hasn’t changed, but there’s still a decent amount of options available when deciding how to approach your targets. Know what you’re getting yourself into and you’ll have a good time.</p>
<p>Performance is exactly what I imagined it would be. You’re looking at 30fps with a few minor hitches here and there, particularly in dense crowds. Textures and assets have also been scaled back considerably, but it’s still a handsome game regardless, and the accompanying music is consistently great.</p>
<p>Feral has promised a free Switch 2 upgrade in 2026 along with an extra Contracts Mode, so if you’re happy to wait until then, then by all means do so. But Hitman: Absolution on Switch is solid, flaws and all.</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/hitman-absolution]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/lenovos-15-inch-512gb-laptop-is-nearly-free-amazon-cuts-prices-by-78-and-wants-it-all-gone-2000644589</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/lenovo%E2%80%99s-15-inch-512gb-laptop-is-nearly-free-amazon-cuts-prices-by-78-and-wants-it-all-gone.1354666/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Picking a new laptop isn’t easy these days. With endless options flooding the market, most of us tend to stick to reliable brands and Lenovo remains one of the few that never disappoints. Right now, one of its most complete models, the Lenovo <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5601/">IdeaPad Slim 3 with a 15.3‑inch FHD+ display, Intel Core i5 processor, 16GB DDR5 RAM and 512GB PCIe SSD, is down to an all‑time low of $549 from $2,499</a>, now 78% off.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5601/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Power, Speed, and Everyday Practicality</h2>
<p>The Lenovo IdeaPad Slim 3 is built for the kind of multitasking modern life demands. The <strong>13th‑gen Intel Core i5‑13420H chip delivers eight cores</strong> (four Performance + four Efficiency cores) and twelve threads which means you can run multiple professional apps, stream media, and browse with dozens of tabs open – all without slowdown. Its turbo frequency reaches 4.6 GHz, giving the extra power burst needed for quick data crunchingor content creation sessions.</p>
<p>Storage also gets a serious boost thanks to the 512 GB PCIe SSD: That’s enough space for a full library of files, photos and software, while keeping boot and loading times near‑instant. It’s the kind of performance jump that makes going back to a traditional hard drive nearly impossible. You only need to lift the lid and the system wakes instantly, ready for work or play.</p>



<p>Then there’s the display: a <strong>15.3‑inch WUXGA panel (1920 × 1200) with a 16:10 aspect ratio for extra vertical room</strong>. It’s crisp, bright at 300 nits, and features an anti‑glare coating that keeps reflections minimal even under strong lighting. The narrow bezels make the entire setup look modern, while the 45 percent NTSC color coverage produces consistent tones for everyday use. Whether you’re streaming shows or reviewing presentations, the wide‑angle IPS screen ensures what you see is both vibrant and fatigue‑free.</p>
<p>The IdeaPad Slim 3 features Wi‑Fi 6 for faster and more reliable wireless performance and Bluetooth 5.2 for low‑latency peripheral pairing. Its generous port selection makes life easier: two USB‑A ports, one USB‑C with Power Delivery and DisplayPort support, an HDMI output, a 3.5 mm audio jack, an SD card reader, and of course the power connector. That means no annoying dongle juggling when you want to plug in a mouse, transfer photos or connect to an external monitor.</p>



<p>This 15‑inch Lenovo is slimmer than the previous generation by around 10%. At roughly 4 pounds, it strikes the right balance between portability and sturdiness. The hinge feels solid but light enough to open with one hand, and the full‑size keyboard with number pad makes typing comfortable even during long sessions of data entry or writing. Lenovo always manages to hit that sweet spot between form and function and this one’s a perfect example.</p>
<p>Daily usability shines through small, thoughtful touches like efficient cooling that keeps fan noise low and the Copilot key on the keyboard, giving instant access to Microsoft’s AI assistant. That’s a rare feature for a laptop in this price category, and it aligns perfectly with the growing shift toward AI‑enhanced productivity.</p>
<p>Whether you’re browsing the web, managing spreadsheets or taking Zoom calls, the IdeaPad Slim 3 stays responsive and cool through it all. Its battery performance comfortably lasts through a full workday with light productivity mixed with streaming. Pair that with <strong>fast charging and you’re back to 50% in roughly 30 minutes</strong> using any modern USB‑C charger.</p>
<p>If you’ve been looking for a reliable daily driver, the IdeaPad Slim 3 is about as balanced as it gets. Amazon discounts come and go but this one feels special.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/this-pair-of-magnetic-wireless-chargers-costs-peanuts-now-cheaper-than-an-apple-charging-cable-2000644584</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/this-pair-of-magnetic-wireless-chargers-costs-peanuts-now-cheaper-than-an-apple-charging-cable.1354663/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Owning a MagSafe compatible charger is one of those small luxuries that makes daily life feel smooth: no cables, no fumbling, just drop your phone and watch it charge. The only catch? Normally, buying a single official one costs almost as much as a wired charger and cable combined. But this early Black Friday deal flips that logic upside down. Right now on Amazon, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5600/">the Anker Zolo magnetic wireless charger 2-pack is selling for just $25, down from $39</a>. That’s <strong>cheaper than what Apple charges for a single USB-C cable</strong>, and you’re getting two fast wireless pads that work brilliantly with the latest iPhones and AirPods.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5600/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Fast, Cool Convenient Charging for Daily Use</h2>
<p>Magnetic chargers have become a staple among iPhone owners due to the ease they deliver. Instead of searching behind the nightstand for your cable, you just snap your phone onto the charging pad, and it locks in place every time. The Anker Zolo pads use <strong>Qi2 certified technology to deliver up to 15 watts of fast charging</strong> which is sufficient to bring an iPhone 17 Pro Max up to 20 percent in just 19 minutes when combined with a 20W or higher wall adapter.</p>



<p>What makes this a great everyday charger is the smart protection system inside. Anker’s ActiveShield 2.0 monitors<strong> temperature levels more than 8 million times a day</strong>, and automatically adjusts power flow to prevent overheating. That means your phone or earbuds stay cool even during overnight charging, while the battery’s long‑term health remains protected. It’s the kind of detail most people never think about, but it’s crucial if you charge your phone daily and want it to still perform like new next year.</p>



<p>Each pad comes with a <strong>5‑foot cable</strong>&nbsp;which is much longer than most standard chargers-giving you more freedom to move your phone while it’s powering up. You can easily FaceTime, scroll, or stream with the cable stretched comfortably across your couch or desktop, sans that tight, awkward pull that short cords create. If you’ve ever tried texting while your phone’s plugged into a short 3‑foot charger, you know the difference those extra inches make.</p>
<p>The compact form factor makes these chargers great for travel, too. They fit easily into a laptop sleeve or small pouch and come with a handy cable tie that keeps everything neat. Toss one in your backpack for the office and leave the other on your nightstand-no need to keep reconnecting cables or worrying about frayed connectors. The simplicity of dropping your phone on the pad and walking away quickly becomes addictive.</p>



<p>While each Anker Zolo pad works well enough on its own as a charger, and gets two in one set makes it feel like an instant home upgrade. Keep one beside your bed and one on your desk, or place them side by side for family use so that there’s always one handy. Even if you never give much thought to chargers, this deal is of the sort you’ll be appreciative of daily: a little convenience that makes life with technology smoother in subtle ways.</p>
<p>What’s also impressive at this price is how Anker didn’t strip away support or design to make it cheaper. The build feels premium, the surface has enough grip to keep devices in place, and the magnets snap precisely where they should. <strong>Coming in at under $13 per pad</strong>, the value here borders on absurd when compared to single‑charger prices from other brands.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Where Winds Meet has finally launched worldwide after a long period of only being available in China, and if you’re keen to restart your journey at any point, we’ve got the details on whether you can delete your character.</p>



<p>Where Winds Meet launched globally on November 14, 2025, after months of being exclusively available within China, and there’s a staggering amount of content to dig through in the Wuxia open-world adventure.</p>



<p>Regular RPG players will be well accustomed to starting over with a new character, which often requires choosing to delete your progress, and there are some limitations in Where Winds Meet, as we’ve explained here.</p>







<h2 id="h-can-you-delete-your-character-in-where-winds-meet">Can You Delete Your Character in Where Winds Meet?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Limited options. Screenshot by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>There is no option to delete your character in Where Winds Meet, unfortunately, so the process to start again is more lengthy.</strong></p>



<p>While you can customize your character freely at any time from the pause menu, though some customizations, like <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/where-winds-meet-change-hair-color/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">changing hair color</a>, require specific items, you can’t choose to wipe clean and start again with a click of the button.</p>



<p>Instead, the only way to start over is to create a new account in the game, and the only way to delete a character, as a result, is by deleting your account.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-delete-your-account-in-where-winds-meet">How to Delete Your Account in Where Winds Meet</h2>



<p><strong>If you want to delete your account, and therefore your character, in Where Winds Meet, the process is fairly straightforward.</strong></p>



<p>However, it does require creating a new account in the game if you want to start your journey again, and you will lose everything you have earned. </p>







<p>Due to this, some in-game rewards may not be able to be claimed again, if they have already been revealed on your account. While you may be able to redeem them again with a new account, you may be stuck if the redemption is tied to your email address—unless you use an alternative.</p>



<p>Here’s the step-by-step process of how to delete your account in where Winds Meet.</p>



<ol>
<li>Open the game through the launcher.</li>



<li>In the log-in screen, select the profile icon on the left-hand side to open log-in credentials.</li>



<li>Click on the ‘Account Deletion’ option.</li>



<li>On the webpage that pops up, click the checkbox to agree to the conditions stated, and click ‘Next.’</li>



<li>Click ‘Confirm’ on the pop-up that appears.</li>



<li>Fill in the steps to verify account ownership, and add your contact email.</li>



<li>Click ‘Yes’ on the next pop-up.</li>



<li>On the final page, check the box for the agreement, and hit ‘Submit’ to delete your account.</li>
</ol>

            <p>Bungie has settled a copyright lawsuit with writer Matthew Martineau after he alleged the studio had used elements of his work in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/destiny-2">Destiny 2</a>, including its Red War plot and the Curse of Osiris expansion.</p>
<p>As spotted by <a href="https://thegamepost.com/destiny-2-red-war-lawsuit-ends-bungie-full-settlement-author/">The Game Post</a>, the case has now been settled, although the terms of that settlement - including any conditions or compensation - have not been made public.</p>
<p>Bungie <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/destiny-2s-unpopular-removal-of-older-game-content-now-hampering-bungies-ability-to-defend-plagiarism-lawsuit">unsuccessfully tried to dismiss the lawsuit - which alleged it plagiarised elements of Destiny 2's original campaign from a story Martineau posted online</a> - back in May, but a US federal judge ruled that the lawsuit should continue as Bungie had been unable to provide satisfactory evidence to have the case tossed out. That evidence could have been a working copy of Destiny 2 featuring the game's original story campaign, but this - alongside many other, older parts of the game - are no longer playable, having been excised and relegated to Bungie's controversial content "vault".</p>
<p>"A settlement conference was conducted on this date before the undersigned Magistrate Judge," the filing reads. "Negotiations were successful and resulted in the settlement of all claims. The Court thanks counsel and the parties for their efforts in bringing this matter to an amicable resolution."</p>
<p>Parties have sixty days to contest the decision and proceed to court, but as it stands, "all parties have firmly agreed upon a compromise".</p>
<p>It follows a difficult year for the embattled studio, which has been accused of plagiarism across both its Marathon and Destiny 2 brands, and was forced earlier this year to admit that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungie-admits-marathon-includes-artwork-used-without-permission">an external artist's work had been used within upcoming game Marathon without consent</a>. This wasn't the first time Bungie has faced claims of using artists' work without permission, with multiple instances coming to light regarding designs for Destiny 2.</p><p>It's also facing a $200m "wrongful dismissal" lawsuit from Destiny 2 and Marathon reboot director Christopher Barrett. Earlier this year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-responds-to-marathon-reboot-directors-200m-wrongful-dismissal-lawsuit-alleges-disturbing-communications-with-female-employees">Sony responded by detailing Barrett's alleged 'disturbing communications' with female subordinates</a> - including "sexually charged games of 'Truth or Dare'".</p>
<p>Earlier this week we learned <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/destiny-2-hasnt-reached-sonys-expectations-following-36bn-bungie-acquisition-admits-cfo">Destiny 2 had not reached expectations</a> following <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-buying-bungie-for-usd3-6bn">Sony's $3.6bn acquisition</a> of Bungie. In its latest earnings report, Sony recorded a loss in profit in its games segment due to "impairment losses against a portion of Bungie, Inc.'s intangible and other assets in connection with Destiny 2."</p>

              <p>If you’ve ever been stuck<strong> on a long flight watching a movie with those cheap wired earbuds the airline hands out</strong>, you’ll understand why small Bluetooth transmitters exist. The <em>Ugreen</em> airplane Bluetooth 6.0 transmitter solves one of the most annoying travel problems: letting you use your own wireless headphones with the in‑flight entertainment system. Right now, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5599/">it’s down to an all‑time low price of $18, down from its usual $27 on Amazon</a>. It’s the kind of tiny gadget that instantly makes travel more comfortable and feels like a small luxury upgrade.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5599/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>A Game‑Changer for Travel</h2>
<p>What’s so clever about this little adapter is that it turns <strong>almost any traditional audio source into a wireless one</strong>. Plug it into the headphone jack on the plane seat, the TV in your hotel room or even an old car stereo, and you can connect your Bluetooth earbuds or headset in seconds. No tangled wires, no adapters dangling from your seat — just your own choice of headphones and clear sound.</p>



<p>The connection quality is surprisingly solid for something this small. <strong>Due to Bluetooth 6.0, pairing happens almost instantly</strong> and the range extends up to 10 meters — that’s enough to move freely in a living room or even stroll across a hotel suite without losing the signal. The newer Bluetooth spec also cuts down the annoying audio delay that used to make videos and games slightly out of sync.</p>



<p>What’s more, the Ugreen unit <strong>holds up to 18 hours of use in receiver mode and 16 hours in transmission mode</strong>&nbsp;which will easily cover a full day of travel, including layovers and entertainment before landing. You can charge it during use if needed, but in practice, most users say it goes days between charges. For frequent flyers, that’s the difference between a gadget you need to babysit and one you can forget about until the next trip.</p>



<p>But what really makes this adapter flexible is its two‑in‑one design: In TX or transmit mode, it streams audio from non-Bluetooth devices such as airline seats, TVs, or older gaming consoles, directly to wireless headphones. In RX or receive mode, meanwhile, the device does the opposite, turning wired speakers or car stereos into Bluetooth receivers. You can stream music from your phone to your old home speakers or plug it into a car AUX port for instant wireless audio playback.</p>
<p>Even better, the Ugreen transmitter is able to <strong>pair with two pairs of headphones simultaneously</strong>. So if you’re traveling with a friend or partner, both of you can watch the same movie from the plane’s screen without bothering to split a pair of wired earbuds. It’s a simple feature, but one that genuinely makes those long flights more enjoyable. The built‑in microphone is another nice touch – if you’re using it in receiver mode with your phone, you can answer calls hands‑free without disconnecting.</p>
<p>At this price, it’s hard to think of another gadget that adds this much comfort to travel and everyday listening. The build quality is solid, the functionality is well thought out, and it covers so many small annoyances that accumulate over time. It’s the kind of item that costs very little yet quietly changes how you travel and listen. And considering this $18 deal is the lowest it’s ever gone on Amazon, it might be one of those rare impulse buys that pays off immediately.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/when-is-nuketown-coming-to-black-ops-7-release-date-explained.1354639/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 has one of the biggest launch offerings of maps in history. Despite this, players are still desperate for Nuketown to arrive to make Camo challenges easier and create anarchy, and we have its Black Ops 7 release date.</p>



<p>Nuketown is arguably the most famous CoD map, other than maybe Rust. Its iconic nuclear testing ground setup immediately became a fan-favorite, and its popularity only grew with easter eggs. There’s the mannequin easter egg, and the fact that you can drive an RC-XD from one end of the map to the other OUTSIDE the confines of the map!</p>







<p>There are other reasons why Nuketown is so beloved. If you’re desperate to see the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-7-day-one-steam-numbers-compare-badly-to-battlefield-6-and-arc-raiders/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Ops 7</a> mockup, we’ve got Nuketown’s release date and what to expect.</p>



<h2 id="h-nuketown-map-release-date-in-black-ops-7">Nuketown Map Release Date In Black Ops 7</h2>



<figure><figcaption>It won’t look like this, but still. Credit to Activision</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Nuketown arrives in Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 on November 20, coming as part of the preseason content.</strong></p>



<p>Shipment and Nuketown usually drop in Season 1 of a new CoD title. However, Treyarch knows what players like, and they like a nasty shootout on Nuketown. It’s great for weapon boosting because of its size, it’s a kill-haven because of the Scorestreaks potential, and it’s also the perfect map to expedite the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-7-multiplayer-camo-challenges/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">multiplayer camo</a> grind process.</p>







<p>A Call of Duty <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2025/11/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-multiplayer-maps-modes-launch" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">blog</a> discussed the game’s launch maps. It has a lot of them, as we’ve said, but it made it clear to comment on Nuketown:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“Prior to Season 01, where&nbsp;Black Ops 7&nbsp;will be delivering the largest number of new and returning 6v6 maps in&nbsp;Call of Duty history, expect 16 signature 6v6 Multiplayer maps to be available at launch, along with two larger-scale Skirmish Maps, <strong>and the arrival of Nuketown 2025 in the Preseason on November 20, just after launch.</strong>“</p>
</blockquote>



<p>You’ve only got a few days to wait for Nuketown. Then we can unpack any new and returning easter eggs on the map. If you’ve still not got it yet, here’s where you can <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/visit/black-ops-7-loaded-xbox-pc/">buy Black Ops 7 for very cheap</a>.</p>



<h2 id="h-why-didn-t-nuketown-launch-with-black-ops-7">Why Didn’t Nuketown Launch With Black Ops 7?</h2>



<p><strong>The reason Nuketown didn’t launch with Black Ops 7 is presumably so that players would try out and experience the rest of the game’s maps first.</strong></p>



<p>If you don’t know, the camo grind is a <em>big </em>deal for many players. It’s the lifeblood of a year-long Call of Duty journey. Plus, for Black Ops 7—and Warzone—purposes, leveling up guns is important.</p>



<p>An easier way to do this is with smaller maps, featuring more kill opportunities, more points scored, and more XP. Players tend to gravitate to Nuketown and Shipment each year to get this done, and will focus on newer, smaller maps: Look at Stakeout in Black Ops 6 as a prime example.</p>



<p>We’d wager Treyarch wanted some love and attention for the new maps in Black Ops 7 before a majority of the player base makes themselves comfortable in Nuketown for the next few weeks!</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/arena-breakout-infinite-team-mock-escape-from-tarkov/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/arena-breakout-team-mocks-escape-from-tarkov-in-deleted-social-post.1354636/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>In a recent post on social media, the team behind Arena Breakout: Infinite, once accused of plagiarising Escape from Tarkov, has mocked Battlestate Games’ 1.0 launch of the spearhead extraction shooter. The post poked fun at Escape from Tarkov’s ongoing server issues, but shortly after being published, it was removed by MoreFun’s social media team.</p>



<p>The comments under the post were scathing, with many slamming Arena Breakout: Infinite’s lacklustre platform, dwindling player base, and lack of any real impact on the genre.</p>







<h2 id="h-abi-takes-on-bsg-in-x-post">ABI Takes on BSG in X Post</h2>



<p>Arena Breakout: Infinite launched on Steam two months ago, ‘beating Tarkov to the punch’ and pulling in new players, with the game peaking at around 66,000 players on the platform. In the minutes since Escape from Tarkov debuted on Steam, a peak of 21,000 players was secured <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/escape-from-tarkov-1-0-launch-servers-cooked/">amidst launch issues</a> preventing many from accessing the game.</p>



<p>In a now-deleted post on social media, Arena Breakout: Infinite mocked Escape from Tarkov’s server concerns:</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>Within minutes, the post had been removed, likely under the weight of all the comments ripping into MoreFun Studios and Arena Breakout: Infinite. One user wrote, ‘I like your game, but this constant slamming of Tarkov on Twitter is shameful and puts your game in a bad light.’ Another wrote, ‘ABI community is so focused on being better than Tarkov, it’s a total joke.’</p>



<p>Another fetched receipts from Twitch, calling up some viewership figures: ‘Look at the Twitch figures – 300k people still prefer to sit watching a menu vs. 3,000 playing ABI.’</p>







<p>Arena Breakout: Infinite came under fire in 2024 when <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tarkov-dev-arena-plagiarism/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battlestate Games accused MoreFun Studios</a> of ripping off assets and plagiarising Escape from Tarkov. I caught up with MoreFun Studios at Gamescom to grill them on that very topic.</p>



<p>Escape from Tarkov’s 1.0 launch is a phenomenal milestone for the Russian developer. It marks the end of ten years of painstaking development that has reshaped the face of the extraction shooter genre over and over again.</p>



<p>Do you think Arena Breakout: Infinite’s team was right to make a joke at Battlestate Games’ expense? Let me know your thoughts on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

            <p>Capcom's Pragamata has popped up on the South Korean classification board's website.</p>
<p>As spotted by <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/gematsu.com/post/3m5l5wetmus2z">Gematsu</a>, the "action adventure" game - which doesn't currently have a release date - has been rated as suited for players aged 12 and up due to its "mild violence".</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/samsung-quietly-unloads-its-t9-4tb-ssds-on-amazon-now-selling-at-a-new-all-time-low-2000644574</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/samsung-quietly-unloads-its-t9-4tb-ssds-on-amazon-now-selling-at-a-new-all-time-low.1354609/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The ultimate luxury for anyone juggling big files&nbsp;: <strong>SSDs are faster, quieter, and far more reliable than the old-school hard drives</strong> we all grew up with. Of course, that performance usually comes with a pretty steep price. But not today: Samsung <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4947/">just dropped its sleek T9 Portable SSD 4TB to a new all‑time low of $287, down from $399 on Amazon</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4947/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Speed and Stability</h2>
<p>And that’s exactly what tech enthusiasts like most about SSDs: the speed. The T9 doesn’t just deliver: it dominates <strong>with sequential read and write speeds of up to 2,000 MB/s</strong>. That means heavy 4K videos, raw photos, or huge design projects pop up in seconds instead of minutes. For creators, gamers, and students managing several devices, it’s a serious timesaver without the dreaded transfer delays. Better yet, those speeds stay constant during long tasks-no throttling midway through some big job.</p>



<p>Inside, Samsung marries its <strong>trusted V‑NAND flash memory with a USB 3.2 Gen 2×2 interface</strong> to ensure top performance on modern hardware setups. And unlike older drives that overheat under pressure, <strong>the T9 stays really cool</strong> thanks to its Dynamic Thermal Guard. It automatically regulates temperature to prevent overheating, keeping everything stable even during hours of high‑intensity use.</p>



<p>Durability is another area where Samsung didn’t cut corners: The <strong>T9 has a rugged, textured casing</strong> that helps withstand drops and scratches, making it safe to toss into a laptop bag or camera kit. It’s built for travel, jammed workdays, and unpredictable coffee-shop setups. The design is practical yet premium, with rounded corners and a matte black finish that feels as polished as the tech inside.</p>
<p>Compatibility, meanwhile, couldn’t be easier. The <strong>T9 connects easily to Windows PCs, Macs, game consoles</strong> and even newer smartphones like the iPhone 17 Pro, which now supports direct 4K ProRes video capture directly to the drive. For content creators shooting high‑resolution footage, that alone can justify the purchase. That means no more running out of internal storage mid‑recording and no more waiting for files to move before editing begins.</p>
<p>Making long‑term ownership even smoother is the inclusion of Samsung’s <em>Magician Software</em> suite: It automatically handles firmware updates, security management, and health monitoring in the background, so that performance stays optimal without requiring manual tinkering. Encryption options keep sensitive documents protected if the drive is lost or stolen, while regular checks help to prevent data degradation over time.</p>



<p>And it’s even more exciting because<strong> Samsung is the number-one flash memory brand in the world</strong>. But still, the main reason this model gets attention right now is the price dro: Seeing a 4TB drive of this quality dip below the $300 mark is borderline unheard of. It essentially makes high‑speed, professional grade storage accessible to regular consumers.</p>
