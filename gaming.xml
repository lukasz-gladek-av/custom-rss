            <p>John Romero's autobiography Doom Guy: Life in First Person is being adapted for screen in two different forms.</p>
<p>As reported by <a href="https://deadline.com/2024/05/doom-guy-life-in-first-person-documentary-drama-john-romero-quake-wolfenstein-1235944457/">Deadline</a>, the story of the id Software co-founder is being made into a documentary by Canadian filmmaker Rob McCallum.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, a dramatised adaptation of the Doom creator's book is also in the pipeline. Both of these projects are going to be executive produced by Naomi Harvey of Golden Possum Productions.</p>

<p>"Talking with both Rob and Naomi, I knew they were the perfect team to bring Doom Guy to life," Romero said following the news. "Our backgrounds and aspirations have uncanny similarities, and I trust them to tell the story."</p>
<p>McCallum called Romero's journey "the missing antidote for all of us misfit toys looking for hope and kindred spirits in the darkness of the world", while Harvey added the video game icon's story is "one of triumph over trauma, filled with compassion and inspiration".</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/doom-creator-john-romero-is-releasing-a-memoir">Doom Guy: Life in First Person covers Romero's video game career</a>, as well as his childhood and family life. This includes recounts of his alcoholic father, racist grandfather who didn't approve of his parents' mixed-race coupling, and grandmother who ran a brothel in Mexico.</p>
<p>As well as Doom, Romero is also known for Quake and Wolfenstein. These games all pioneered the first person shooter genre, and at GDC last year, Romero was the recipient of a <a href="https://gdconf.com/news/legendary-game-designers-john-romero-and-mabel-addis-honored-gdca-2023">Lifetime Achievement Award</a> for his work.</p>

            <p>There is a time for perfect clarity in a shooter, for clean walls and clear-cut character silhouettes. But this is not it. Retro first-person gunwaltzer <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/selaco">Selaco</a> is a messy machine gun dash through an office exploding with glass, concrete, splinters, and sparks. The glock-toting wreckage 'em up first hit our radar when it was announced as a modern combination of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fear">F.E.A.R.</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/doom">Doom</a>, promising both the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/why-fears-ai-is-still-the-best-in-first-person-shooters">fiendish AI enemies</a> of the former and the satisfying blasting of the latter. Well, it's out today. Bursting forth into the corporate lobby of early access with uzis akimbo, peppering the walls with angry bullets. Good, I say.</p>

<p>You play the security captain of Selaco, a vast facility housing the last refugees from a fallen Earth. You're being invaded; time to shoot. The early access version includes the "entirety of the Base Campaign and covers the majority of the game" we're told in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1592280/view/4191240933893510804">a recent news update on Steam</a>. There are 11 weapons, plus a "Kit System" that lets you mix and match firearm attributes to create, let's say, a frightening nailgun with a shotgun's hefty spread. The big boasting point, however, is some clever F.E.A.R. style enemies, who shout out to each other, remark on your actions, and generally react to your behaviour in a challenging, pressurizing way. "The enemies will communicate, provide cover fire, flank, rush, defend and much more," say developers Altered Orbit Studios. A wonderful promise I hope it can keep.</p>
<p>The shooter has been designed using GZDoom, a source port of great-great-grandaddy shooter Doom, which is still enjoying the attention of modders and mappers to this day. But Altered Orbit have gone much farther than mere tinkering, pushing GZDoom to lunatic extremes. As a casual dabbler in Quake mapping I can only look at the disintegrating props and smoking rubble of Selaco with a kind of terrified awe. It is, in more ways than one, a hardcore FPS. For one thing, it's releasing with a bonus difficulty mode "designed to make Selaco nearly impossible." Gauntlet thrown, folks. </p>
<p>"There are still many ideas we want to explore, systems we want to flesh out, and game modes we want to add to make it even more replayable," say the devs, talking about the decision to launch into early access. "With our roots being in video game modding, we feel perfectly comfortable releasing something big and making it bigger over time at our own pace."</p>
<p>Heck. It's been a decent few months for boomer shooters. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/phantom-fury-review">Phantom Fury</a> was another setpiece <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">FPS</a> inspired by Half-Life era blastin', and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mullet-mad-jack">Mullet Mad Jack</a> was and ultra-stylish corridor crash, according to Ed's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/mullet-mad-jack-review">review</a>. We might be reaching a point of retroshoot saturation but, if I'm honest, one more homage to F.E.A.R. will not go amiss. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/trepang-2">Trepang2</a> came out last year with the same love for the much-lauded 2005 psychological bulletdrama, and we quite liked that too. "Oh, I do enjoy shooting these faces!" wrote Alice O (RPS in peace) in her <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/trepang2-review-its-an-indie-fear">review</a>. For fans of this type of game it truly has been good eatin'. You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1592280/Selaco/">pick up Selaco on Steam for Â£21/$25</a>.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/fortnite-crew-pack-and-skin-for-june-2024.886410/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/fortnite-guide/23941614/fortnite-crew-pack-skin<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="tKh0sI"><strong>Fortnite Crew </strong>is a monthly subscription service for <a href="https://www.polygon.com/game/fortnite-battle-royale/40155"><em>Fortnite</em></a><em>.</em></p>
<p id="xUFOCQ">Members who subscribe to Fortnite Crew receive access to the current Battle Pass, a top up of V-Bucks to their account, and perhaps most importantly, exclusive cosmetics through the Fortnite Crew Pack.</p>
<p id="i7pF7R">As an additional incentive to keep subscribing, you also receive bonus Legacy Styles for certain skins for each additional month you remain a subscriber.</p>
<hr id="T6SQrd">

<p id="2EI5pO">The Fortnite Crew Pack for June 2024 is the <strong>Jing </strong>skin. You can take a closer look at the skin and related accessories, its Legacy Styles and Lego Fortnite style in the following posts by <a href="https://x.com/BuonannoJayden/status/1794778253057749261">BuonannoJayden</a> and <a href="https://x.com/iFireMonkey/status/1793921291465933029">iFireMonkey</a> on X:</p>


<p id="XUkjYt">As shown, the skin has a number of Legacy Styles to unlock<strong> </strong>the longer you keep your Fortnite Crew subscription â with a total of six styles (across five additional months) to unlock.</p>
<p id="tXlub6">You have until the last day of the month to claim the skin â you can see the following section for the exact time for when each Fortnite Crew Pack changes â from which point itâs then unavailable to new subscribers.</p>
<p id="qoNtzk">At least, for now; Epic has said âprevious Crew Packsâ items may be made available again to Crew members at a later date,â but practically, if you have your heart on a certain pack, be sure to subscribe and claim while you can.</p>
<hr id="3GRlxJ">
<h2 id="CwZaqI"><strong>Fortnite Crew release date and time: When does each new Fortnite Crew Pack release?</strong></h2>
<p id="LA1U1p">Each new Fortnite Crew Pack is available on <strong>the last day of each month</strong> for the proceeding month at the following times:</p>
<ul>
<li id="VnqGJb">
<strong>4 p.m. PST</strong> for the west coast of North America</li>
<li id="7sUMlu">
<strong>7 p.m. EST</strong> for the east coast of North America</li>
<li id="566NvI">
<strong>12 a.m. GMT</strong> for the U.K. (the following day)</li>
<li id="BgKx8B">
<strong>1 a.m. CEST</strong> for western Europe/Paris (the following day)</li>
<li id="Auh8Gp">
<strong>8 a.m. JST</strong> in Japan/Tokyo (the following day)</li>
</ul>
<p id="EF9ald">For example, Nov. 2023âs pack (featuring the Drakon Steel Hybrid skin) was released on Oct. 31 at the above times in the Americas, and on Nov. 1 elsewhere.</p>
<p id="24qiFH">This means if youâre thinking of subscribing for the first time, itâs worth starting just before the above date and time to ensure you get the current Fortnite Crew Pack before it changes over.</p>
<hr id="ZH2QPm">
<h2 id="Q3DBdh"><strong>What is Fortnite Crew?</strong></h2>
<p id="68kFSW">Fortnite Crew is a subscription where, for $11.99 each month, youâll receive the following:</p>
<ul>
<li id="QXSOh3">Access to the current seasonâs Battle Pass</li>
<li id="HklqeR">1,000 V-Bucks</li>
<li id="UY8jST">The latest Fortnite Crew Pack (with an exclusive skin and âat least oneâ matching cosmetic accessory)</li>
<li id="qUimnI">The next Legacy Style for any unlocked Fortnite Crew skins</li>
<li id="vL32wk">Rocket Pass Premium for <em>Rocket League</em>
</li>
</ul>
<p id="eJzIuu">As with all V-Bucks purchases, your currency could be locked to the platform you chose to start subscribing, so choose carefully. (At the time of writing, Nintendo Switch is the only platform where your wallet wonât be shared across other platforms.)</p>
<hr id="XMBe74">
<h2 id="TfDKCs"><strong>What happens if I cancel Fortnite Crew?</strong></h2>
<p id="zo9tF3">If you cancel Fortnite Crew, youâll keep all unlocked Fortnite Crew Pack cosmetics â including Legacy Styles â as well as any awarded V-Bucks and Battle Passes earned during that period.</p>

During recording sessions, Griffith was told to do multiple takes for lines, one that would go into the game that was eventually released, and another that could go into a hypothetical M-rated <em>Shadow the Hedgehog</em>.

It was just every sentence, I would be yelling âSonic, give me that f***ing Chaos Emerald!â or something like that. I had no idea what was going on but I just went with it, and I had fun.

<p>Following the move to go independent following Microsoftâs acquisition of Activision Blizzard, Toys for Bob has announced that it has reached an agreement with Xbox to publish its next game.</p>



<p>Taking to Twitter, Toys for Bob announced, âWeâre excited to announce that weâll be partnering with @Xbox to publish our next new game. Weâre still very early in development, so you might not hear from us for a bit â but know that weâre working hard on an experience weâre so sooo inspired about! Canât wait to share more.â</p>



<p>The tweet was followed by a purple heart emoji, which could be a subtle nod to Spyro the Dragon, rumored to be the next game the developers are working on.</p>



<p>In March 2024, it was rumored that Toys for Bob reached an agreement that will see the newly independent studio make its first game for Xbox. Matt Booty made the announcement, however, he did not share what the studioâs next game will be.</p>



<p>As Toys for Bob announces, its next game is still early in development, so itâs likely far from being revealed or released.</p>



<p>What do you think Toys for Bob will be developing for Xbox? Let us know in the comments below.</p>

Quality is a top priority for us, and we know you feel the same way. For this reason, we've made the decision to shift the release of the game to 2025."</p><p>While this comes as sad news to those looking forward to the third game in the spooky stealth and adventure franchise, the announcement revealed more information on it is coming later in summer 2024. "In the meantime, we'd like to thank you for your patience and ongoing support," it said.</p><p>Little Nightmares 3 has been quiet ever since <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/little-nightmares-3-announced-coming-in-2024">its announcement at Gamescom in August 2023</a>, which came with an eerie reveal trailer which showed two new characters: Low and Alone. It also confirmed the game could be played solo with an AI companion or with a friend through two player co-op. It's currently announced for PlayStation 4 and 5, Xbox One and Series X and S, Nintendo Switch, and PC.</p><p><em>Ryan Dinsdale is an IGN freelance reporter.

Players speculate the destruction of Meridia and its Terminid supercolony will lead into the release of a third faction, potentially the long-extinct Illuminate.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>MAJOR ORDER: OPERATION "ENDURING PEACE"</p><p>The time has come.

This led some to call the Major Order a âbroken messâ, and nigh-on impossible to complete on the harder difficulties.</p><p>In a post on the Helldivers <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1102970375731691612/1102974129734434919/1246073418995208203" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Discord</a>, community manager Baskinator confirmed a hotfix is inbound to tackle the problem: âThank you to everyone that made us aware of the spawning bug in the current Major Order,â Baskinator said. âA hotfix is currently being worked on for that issue and will be deployed as soon as possible. We'll let you know as soon as it's available.â</p><p>The hope is this hotfix will hit Helldivers 2 sooner rather than later, given the Major Order itself has an expiry date of early next week. Some are now calling for Arrowhead to extend the Major Order to encourage more players to jump in after the bug is squashed.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div><h3>Helldivers 2 Polar Patriots Premium Warbond Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>This week, Arrowhead revealed it is in the process of setting the studio up so it can âmake more and better stuffâ in the long-term. In <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1d2pozq/hello_fellow_helldivers_greetings_from_the_newly/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>an introductory post on reddit</u></a>, CEO Shams Jorjani, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-boss-of-helldivers-2-dev-arrowhead-is-now-its-chief-creative-officer-i-care-more-about-weapon-balance-than-qbrs"><u>who recently replaced previous Arrowhead CEO and current Chief Creative Officer Johan Pilestedt</u></a>, said the studio has had to adjust to the enormous success and higher profile Helldivers 2 has brought to the company.</p><p>PlayStation 5 and PC co-op shooter Helldivers 2 is the fastest-selling PlayStation game of all time, having shifted an incredible 12 million copies in just 12 weeks since going on sale earlier this year. Amid the huge revenue Helldivers 2 has generated, Arrowhead itself has suffered a number of crises, including launch server problems and, most recently, a battle with Sony itself over the console makerâs controversial attempt to force Steam players to account link to PlayStation Network.</p><p>Arrowhead plans to add to Helldivers 2 in meaningful ways to keep players interested in its live service, but some have called on the developer to take more time with balance patches and Premium Warbond releases after recent efforts fell flat, and <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/helldivers-2-dev-says-it-will-take-more-time-with-patches-to-maintain-the-quality-standard-we-want-and-you-deserve"><u>Arrowhead has indicated thatâs what it intends to do</u></a>.</p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

<p data-characters="211" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Iâd like you to try to remember the simplest and most repetitive game youâve ever played. Okay, now get ready to relegate that game to second place, because that dubious honor now belongs to <em>Banana</em>. </p> <p data-characters="254" data-current-count="254" data-injectable="false">Iâm talking about a game where you simply click on the still image of a banana as many times as you can. No, Iâm not talking about a game such as <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/cookie-clicker-tips-and-strategy-guide/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cookie Clicker</a></em> where repeatedly clicking on a cookie will bring you new results for <strong>days</strong> on end.</p> <p data-characters="479" data-current-count="733" data-injectable="true"><em>Banana</em> is a different thing, because as far as in-game events go, nothing happens beyond seeing the counter that tells you how many times youâve clicked on the banana â or on the screen, really â go up a number. So, why did the good folks at <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/banana-a-game-where-you-rapidly-click-on-a-jpeg-of-a-banana-and-nothing-else-has-an-all-time-peak-of-31124-players-on-steamheres-why/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PC Gamer</a> find more than 30,000 people clicking on that banana at the same time? Yes, <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2923300/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">SteamDB</a> shows that a little bit over twenty hours ago, more people were clicking on the banana than they were playing <em>Diablo 4 </em>and <em>Fallout 76.</em></p>
 <p data-characters="425" data-current-count="425" data-injectable="true">It turns out that itâs not because of the game itself â for most people, at least, I hope. The thing about <em>Banana</em> is that itâs an Egglike, the term that journalist Harvey Randall used to define the genre before anyone had the courage to, so thatâs what itâll be for now on. <em><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2784840/Egg/">Egg</a></em> is a game about, well, clicking an egg. Thing is, in both games, clicking will get clickers some sort of actual rewards. </p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot via Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="381" data-current-count="681" data-injectable="true">It works somewhat similarly to Steamâs collectible game cards. Thing is, whereas youâll earn a limited amount of cards just by having a regular game open on the background, <em>Banana</em>âs bananas can be amassed by playing the game for one minute, then for spamming clicks for every three hours, and thereâll be a chance to earn a rare banana once every 18 hours. </p>
 <p data-characters="545" data-current-count="545" data-injectable="true">All in all, this is a bizarre way to pass your time and to try to earn some money â some of these bananas are getting sold for dozens of bucks. Still, there are a few interesting surprises here. One, <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/banana-a-game-where-you-rapidly-click-on-a-jpeg-of-a-banana-and-nothing-else-has-an-all-time-peak-of-31124-players-on-steamheres-why/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PC Gamer</a> states that <em>Banana</em> has a surprisingly wholesome community, meaning that people are probably aware of the bonkers-ness of it all, and are in it also for the laughter. Second, just how refreshing is it to learn of a wacky game revolving around pictures, that has nothing to do with damn NFTs or any sort of dumb Blockchain-driven stuff?</p>
 <p data-characters="87" data-current-count="87" data-injectable="false">You can now try to earn hundreds or perhaps even thousands of cents on <em>Banana</em> on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2923300/Banana/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Steam</a>.</p>

<p data-characters="258" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Can anyone even remember what vanilla <em>Skyrim</em> looks like? I think weâve all collectively decided that what Bethesda released all those years ago is a far cry from what many of us experience today, thanks to the near-endless array of mods we can install.</p> <p data-characters="235" data-current-count="235" data-injectable="false">No one in the modding community seems more dedicated to improving <em>The Elder Scrolls 5</em> than <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/118229" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">JaySerpa</a>. Ever keen to inject a bit more immersion, this time theyâre bringing us an expansion of one of the more interesting side quests.</p> <figure data-current-count="535" data-injectable="true"><p> <iframe title="Destroy The Dark Brotherhood - Quest Expansion" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/a8gNJ0Ctbf0?feature=oembed&amp;enablejsapi=1&amp;origin=https://www.destructoid.com" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure>
 <p data-characters="354" data-current-count="354" data-injectable="false">In the base game, âDestroy the Dark Brotherhoodâ does exactly what it says on the tin, in that it tasks you with killing the merry band of murderers that dwell within the assassinsâ Sanctuary. In this updated version from JaySerpa, however, a few additional things have been added, presumably to give the standard mission a bit of <em>umph</em>.</p> <h2 id="h-improves-the-lackluster-original" data-injectable="false">Improves the âlacklusterâ original</h2> <p data-characters="38" data-current-count="392" data-injectable="false">As the description on Nexus Mods says:</p> <blockquote data-current-count="677" data-injectable="true"> <p>This mod introduces new lore-friendly ways to get kidnapped by Astrid (allowing you to Destroy the Dark Brotherhood even after sparing Grelod) while also expanding the actual quest to destroy the DB with new dialogue, choices, more memorable fights and a more cohesive quest. Enjoy!</p> </blockquote>
 <p data-characters="419" data-current-count="419" data-injectable="true">It essentially implements two things by giving you an alternative way to meet the Brotherhood without having to kill Grelod the Kind, while also making âDestroyâ¦â itself a bit longer. It does this by not giving you the password to the Sanctuary immediately, meaning you have to seek it out. The mod also comes with new voices, which have either been spliced from vanilla dialogue or has been recorded.</p>
 <p data-characters="311" data-current-count="311" data-injectable="false">Basically, itâs one more reason why people keep playing <em>Skyrim</em>. So long as there are mods out there that expand or improve upon the 2011 release, weâre going to keep seeing <em>TES5</em> in the gaming limelight. <em>The Elder Scrolls 6</em> is seriously going to have to do a lot of work to match this kind of legacy.</p>

            <p>Supermassive Games has delayed the release of Little Nightmares 3, saying it needs "a little extra time to prepare".</p>
<p>In a statement posted to X, the social media platform formerly known as Twitter, the Dark Pictures developer said that "as much as [it] can't wait for you to return to the Nowhere", "quality is a top priority" and that's why it's decided to "shift the release of the game to 2025".</p>

<p>"Ever since the announcement of Little Nightmares 3 at Gamescom last year, we've been thrilled to see our community buzzing with excitement and anticipation," the team said.</p>
<p>"As much as we can't wait for you to return to the Nowhere, we also want to make sure we give the game the care and love it deserves. Quality is a top priority for us, and we know you feel the same way.</p> <div>

<p>"For this reason, we've made the decision to shift the release of the game to 2025."</p>
<p>The statement closes with the promise that more information will come "later this summer", and thanked fans for their patience and "ongoing support".</p>
<p>Announced <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/little-nightmares-3-in-development-from-dark-pictures-studio-supermassive">back in August</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/little-nightmares-3-in-development-from-dark-pictures-studio-supermassive">Little Nightmares 3 marks the first time a mainline entry in the series won't be handled by original developer Tarsier Studios</a>. Supermassive Games - the team behind The Dark Pictures Anthology and Until Dawn - is at the helm, taking players on an adventure following two new protagonists. Sadly, though, despite the two protagonists can be played via online co-op, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/little-nightmares-3-doesnt-have-couch-co-op-to-preserve-atmosphere-and-immersion">couch co-op will not be an option</a>.</p>
<p>"Co-op was the most requested feature from our fans, so it was really important for us to give them that," Bandai Namco producer Coralie Feniello said when the game was announced. "I do think that it will add a layer to the game as well, by letting you experience it with a friend.</p>
<p>"But at the same time, we really want the player to experience it as they want. So that's why we kept single player, so if you don't play online co-op you would be able to play with AI with you."</p>

But on the eve of its arrival next week, having Kennedy and Headland alike publicly decrying bigoted abuse is a positive step in the right direction: and a sign that Lucasfilm, at least this time, knows what itâs going to get into should the series find itself in the sights of the unyielding nature of the right-wing culture war.</p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://disneyplus.bn5x.net/c/379647/564546/9358?subId1=GO-&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.disneyplus.com%2Fseries%2Fthe-acolyte%2F39RAA0bOYXQ0%3Fgad_source%3D1%26gclid%3DCjwKCAjwx-CyBhAqEiwAeOcTdbKPFFErdwiiZ7l1vHfkJUVzzPnassrYEhlUZHHL08W4bFRaq6qg9hoCqTMQAvD_BwE%26gclsrc%3Daw.ds&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://disneyplus.bn5x.net/c/379647/564546/9358?subId1=GO-&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.disneyplus.com%2Fseries%2Fthe-acolyte%2F39RAA0bOYXQ0%3Fgad_source%3D1%26gclid%3DCjwKCAjwx-CyBhAqEiwAeOcTdbKPFFErdwiiZ7l1vHfkJUVzzPnassrYEhlUZHHL08W4bFRaq6qg9hoCqTMQAvD_BwE%26gclsrc%3Daw.ds" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Star Wars: The Acolyte</em></a></span> begins streaming June 4 on Disney+.</p><p>(This post originally appeared <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://gizmodo.com/star-wars-leslye-headland-kathleen-kennedy-racism-1851508961&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://gizmodo.com/star-wars-leslye-headland-kathleen-kennedy-racism-1851508961">on <em>Gizmodo</em>.</a></span>)</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>With the recent announcement that God of War Ragnarok is finally coming to PC, everyone with an interest is preparing their systems. To do so, itâs important to first learn the God of War Ragnarok PC system requirements, so here you go!</p>



<h2 id="h-the-god-of-war-ragnarok-system-requirements-on-pc">The God of War Ragnarok System Requirements on PC</h2>



<p>I donât know about you but I prefer knowing whether my system can run an upcoming game beforehand. Itâs not like Iâm going out to buy a new part to run a single game, but it can help temper expectations. Here are the minimum and recommended system requirements for God of War Ragnarok on PC:</p>



<h3 id="h-minimum-system-requirements">Minimum System Requirements</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>OS</strong>: Windows 10 or Later</li>



<li><strong>GPU</strong>: Nvidia GeForce GTX 1650 / AMD Radeon RX 5500XT</li>



<li><strong>CPU</strong>: Intel Core i3 8100 / AMD Ryzen 3 1300X</li>



<li><strong>RAM</strong>: 16GB</li>



<li><strong>Storage</strong>: 90GB SSD</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-recommended-system-requirements">Recommended System Requirements</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>OS</strong>: Windows 10 or Later</li>



<li><strong>GPU</strong>: Nvidia GeForce RTX 3070 / AMD Radeon RX 6800</li>



<li><strong>CPU</strong>: Intel Core i7 9700 / AMD Ryzen 7 3700X</li>



<li><strong>RAM</strong>:16GB</li>



<li><strong>Storage</strong>:90GB SSD</li>
</ul>







<h2 id="h-how-long-to-beat-god-of-war-ragnarok-on-pc">How Long to Beat God of War Ragnarok on PC?</h2>



<p>Assuming your system can run God of War Ragnarok once it launches on PC, letâs take a look at how much time youâll squeeze out of the action adventure. On average, players spend approximately 27 hours completing the main story, up to 55 hours completing every bit of content in the main game, and another 10 or so hours completing Valhalla.</p>



<p>That said, Valhalla is a premier roguelite game mode that adds countless challenges and new gameplay mechanics to the fray. You can easily spend far more than ten hours playing through the available content!</p>

                <p>Strauss Zelnick, the CEO of Rockstar Games parent company Take-Two, has weighed in with his thoughts on how new technology like generative AI could impact the video game industry. Speaking at the <a href="https://wsw.com/webcast/cowen162/ttwo/2064582" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">TD Cowen Technology, Media, and Telecom Conference</a>, Zelnick said generative AI will absolutely shake up how games are made, but it will not reduce employment levels.</p><p>"Generative AI will allow us to do a bunch of things more efficiently, so we'll turn out attention to other things. Those other things will probably still be costly and time-consuming," he said. "I don't think for a minute that generative AI is going to reduce employment. That's crazy. That's actually crazy. It's not going to make people irrelevant. It's going to change the nature of certain forms of employment. And that's a good thing."</p>

<p>As an example, Zelnick said in the 1870s, around 65-70% of the US population made their living in the agriculture business. Today, that number is around 1-2%. People aren't working those jobs as much these days because people don't generally enjoying getting their hands dirty (and increasingly farmers don't either, Zelnick said, pointing to advancements in automation in the farming business).</p><p>"When was the last time you ran into someone who said, 'It's horrible. I can't get a job as a farmer. I'm trying. I'm unemployed. There are no farming jobs for me,'" he said.</p><p>Beyond the video game industry, Zelnick foresees "certain people" losing jobs to AI, like those who work in call centers for "routine" things like helping someone buy a sofa online. A pop-up box that shows up on a furniture website helping you make a purchase is already AI in action, and the human who had that job previously may now be working somewhere else and potentially earning more, Zelnick said.</p><p>"These are competent people who are highly educated. Better jobs came along that probably pay them more. I'm in a WhatsApp chat with a bunch of Silicon Valley CEOs and the conventional wisdom out there is that AI is going to make us all unemployed. It is just the stupidest thing I've ever heard. The history of productivity tools is that it increases employment. It increases value. It increases yield. It enhances growth. All of these things will happen," he said.</p><p>Shifting back to video games specifically, Zelnick said Take-Two has been in the AI business since its very first days in the form of computer programming. Take-Two has already benefitted from numerous game development tools that have led to many yield efficiencies, he said, and costs have gone up, too.</p><p>"Those efficiencies were created, and allowed us to turn our attention to more complex activities that continue to engage and delight consumers," he said.</p><p>Zelnick has been one of the more outspoken video game executives on the subject of AI. Before this, he said AI has a lot of potential for video games, but it <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/a-true-gta-competitor-wont-be-made-with-ai-take-two-boss-says/1100-6511244/" data-ref-id="1100-6511244">won't allow developers to create a GTA competitor with ease.</a></p><p>"It's not going to allow someone to say, 'Please develop the competitor to Grand Theft Auto that's better than Grand Theft Auto', and then they just send it out and ship it digitally and that will be that. People will try, but that won't happen," Zelnick said.</p><p>Take-Two recently announced a dramatic cost-cutting program that led to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-parent-company-explains-why-it-just-canceled-games/1100-6523539/" data-ref-id="1100-6523539">hundreds of layoffs and numerous game cancellations.</a> Microsoft, too, is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xboxs-phil-spencer-reflects-on-recent-mass-layoffs/1100-6522156/" data-ref-id="1100-6522156">heavily invested in AI and also had significant layoffs recently.</a> Electronic Arts, meanwhile, is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-laying-off-around-670-people-sunsetting-unspecified-games/1100-6521460/" data-ref-id="1100-6521460">very enthusiastic about AI and slashed hundreds of jobs.</a></p>

        <p>Take-Two said it has "refocused our pipeline within Private Division" but has "nothing further to note"</p>

    </div><div>



            <p>Polish developer Bloober Team has reportedly lost a publishing deal with Take-Two's indie-focused label Private Division after the latter pulled out of the agreement.</p>
<p>Bloober Team posted a <a href="https://www.bankier.pl/wiadomosc/BLOOBER-TEAM-S-A-Informacja-na-temat-zakonczenia-wspolpracy-z-wydawca-Take-Two-Interactive-Software-Inc-dotyczacej-produkcji-tytulu-Projekt-C-8756391.html#pvy7zfso61">Polish-only financial notice</a>, which appears to indicate it receive notice of the deal's end from Take-Two yesterday.</p>
<p>The two companies were working together on an unannounced survival horror game referred to as Project C, news of which <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bloober-team-is-working-with-take-two-to-develop-a-brand-game-based-on-a-new-ip">emerged last month</a>.</p>
<p>The release was spotted by Twitter user and games analyst <a href="https://x.com/MauroNL3/status/1796102364463501426">MauroNL</a>, who said terms of the termination are being negotiated and Bloober Team may seek another publisher.</p>
<p>When asked for confirmation, a Take-Two spokesperson responded with the following statement.</p>
<p>"As we announced earlier this month and in conjunction with our quarterly results, our entire organization contributed to our cost reduction efforts, including Private Division. We refocused our pipeline within Private Division and are still planning to support an array of titles, including Moon Studioâs No Rest for the Wicked, which launched on early access for PC on April 18th; WÄtÄ Workshop Game Studioâs Tales of the Shire: A The Lord of the Rings Game, which is planned to launch in the second half of 2024; and our title in partnership with Gamefreak.</p>
<p>"We have nothing further to note."</p>
<p>Private Division has been going through a number of changes since Take-Two announced it was <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/take-two-laying-off-5-of-staff">laying off 5% of all staff</a> as part of its third cost-reduction program in just over a year.</p>
<p>The publisher <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/take-two-reportedly-shuts-down-roll7-and-intercept-games-private-division-suffers-mass-layoffs">reportedly closed both Rollerdrome developer Roll7 and Kerbal Space Program 2 studio Intercept Games</a>. While Take-Two says it <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/zelnick-on-roll7-and-intercept-games-we-didnt-shutter-those-studios">has not technically closed any studios</a>, various members of the Intercept team have confirmed <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/intercept-games-facing-layoffs-by-end-of-june">there will be layoffs at the developer next month</a>.</p>

<p data-characters="225" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Blizzard has announced its beta for the next <em>World of Warcraft</em> expansion, <em>The War Within</em>, is just around the corner.

Additionally, anyone who pre-orders the Epic edition of <em>The War Within</em> will also have immediate Beta access.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/diablo-4-is-celebrating-its-first-anniversary-with-free-shop-items-and-a-lotta-loot-goblins/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=diablo-4-is-celebrating-its-first-anniversary-with-free-shop-items-and-a-lotta-loot-goblins<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="387" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Itâs hard to believe <em>Diablo 4</em> is coming up on its one-year anniversary, but much easier to believe that its ill-fated predecessor, <em>Diablo Immortal, </em>is almost two. Regardless, <em>D4 </em>players are being treated to some free shop cosmetics, loot goblins galore, and the return of the hearty Motherâs Blessing experience buff, detailed over in a <a href="https://news.blizzard.com/en-us/diablo4/24096024/celebrate-the-diablo-anniversary-with-march-of-the-goblins" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">blog post</a> on Blizzardâs website.</p> <h2 id="h-march-of-the-goblins-and-free-shop-items" data-injectable="false">March of the Goblins and free shop items</h2> <p data-characters="349" data-current-count="349" data-injectable="false">The first âpartâ of the event runs from June 6 to 13 and harkens the March of the Goblins, as well as a chance to choose some free new cosmetics found in the gameâs shop. The influx of Treasure Goblins means more greed shrines, Treasure Goblins that appear in pairs (or large packs), and bigger loot drops when theyâre killed</p> <p data-characters="548" data-current-count="897" data-injectable="true">The blog post seems to allude to the fact that the free shop items will be selectable, one at a time, over the period of June 6 to 12, with all of them available to claim until June 20. I assume this means youâll be able to select as many items as days have passed since the 6th until youâre able to grab them all. They appear to be a modest selection of items pulled from bundles purchasable in the shop, but forgive me if my knowledge of in-game purchases is a bit lacking. You can check out a preview of the items in the image below:</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"></figure> <h2 data-injectable="false">Motherâs Blessing: Anniversary Edition</h2> <p data-characters="467" data-current-count="767" data-injectable="false">The fan-favorite buff that grants a 25% boost to experience and 50% boost to earned gold is making a return for a whopping 10 days during the celebration. No exact start date appears to be set, but itâll probably kick off around the end of the first part of the anniversary event. Gold costs have been a major sticking point this season with the introduction of Masterworking, so a boost is going to more than welcome to those looking to min-max their loadouts.</p>

            <link>https://aftermath.site/schim-demo-steam</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/shadow-platforming-game-schim-is-as-fun-as-i-hoped.886308/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/schim-demo-steam<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Iâve been excited for shadow-jumping platform game <em>SCHiM</em> since I first heard about itâ¦Iâll be honest, I canât even remember, 2022? It comes out in July, but thereâs a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1519710/SCHiM/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">demo on Steam</a> now, and itâs pretty great.</p><p>If you put aside the essential weirdness of the concept, <em>SCHiM</em> is simple: you play a little critter thatâs attached to the shadow of a specific person. You get separated from that person and have to wander the world in search of them. Youâre a little shadow dude, so you can only move in other shadows: hopping between them, hitching rides in the shadows of cars and pedestrians, and occasionally interacting with your environment to create new shadows to navigate.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="SCHiM â Release Date Trailer â Nintendo Switch" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zG1VYCUB2Qk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>The gameâs world is rendered in outline and broad colors, making it feel both basic and foreign, and this is a choice that really made me feel like the shadows were their own world adjacent to the human one, where an empty bike rack or two people talking was a secret place just for me. While other games have you platforming along objects, <em>SCHiM</em>âs focus on where objects <em>arenât</em> is such a fun, weird way to think about space. The length of a lamppost becomes a skinny river to swim in, or a busy roadway becomes an inverted game of <em>Frogger</em>. Thereâs this wonderful sense of exploring the neglected corners of the everyday world thatâs just delightful, a feeling added to by the gameâs chill music and the charming splash sound effect as you move between shadows. </p><p>The platforming in the demo wasnât terribly challenging, though that could change through the full game. Some levels are straightforward, working your way down the street by leaping between a row of shadows. Other levels introduce new challenges: studying the routes of joggers to get across a sunny bridge, or timing your leaps between moving cars. You can survive for a couple hops out of the shadows before youâre teleported back to where you came from, so it feels low-stakes to try things out, though I was occasionally swept up in the shadows of a moving car or cyclist and carried pretty far away from my goal. But even this feels fun, a playful way to throw yourself at the mercy of the world and see where it takes you.&nbsp;</p><p>I am so into this game. It feels like <em>play</em> in the way games can sometimes lose sight of in pursuit of technical polish or ever-increasing skill challenges, like how playing âthe floor is lavaâ felt as a kid. The full game comes out July 18 on <a href="https://schimgame.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Steam, Switch, and PlayStation</a>, and Iâm so excited to see more of it.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/this-week-in-gaming-business-sonys-future</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/this-week-in-gaming-business-sonys-future-and-more.886299/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/this-week-in-gaming-business-sonys-future<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>It's time to take a look at another week in the world of gaming business, and this week saw PlayStation's new CEO Hermen Hulst sharing some words about the company's future, as well as a studio entering hibernation and more.</p>

<p>Here's our roundup of what's been happening on the business side of the gaming industry this week!</p>

<h2>PlayStation's new CEOs sets out the company's approach</h2>

<p>This week saw new PlayStation CEOs Hermen Hulst and Hideaki Nishino talking all things PlayStation during the Sony Game and Network Services Business Segment presentation (which is, perhaps, not quite as sexy as <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/every-playstation-state-of-play-sgf-2024-announcement">yesterday's State of Play</a>).</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/helldivers-2-playstation-gaming-business.jpg?itok=5_9JEf83 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/helldivers-2-playstation-gaming-business.jpg?itok=sqvW4kiX 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Expect to see more PlayStation live-service games appearing on PC day-and-date.</figcaption></figure><p>During that presentation, Hulst and Nishino said that live-service PlayStation games will be released on PC simultaneously (like with&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2</em>), but that "tentpole" single-player narrative games will still be on PlayStation first.</p>

<p>That meeting also revealed that the PS5 is Sony's most profitable PlayStation console to date, and other exciting PlayStation tidbits as well. You can check out the <a href="https://www.sony.com/en/SonyInfo/IR/library/presen/business_segment_meeting/pdf/2024/GNS_E.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank">supplementary material from the presentation here</a> for more nerdy stats.</p>

<h2><em>Wildermyth&nbsp;</em>developer Worldwalker Games goes into "hibernation"</h2>

<p>The developer of tactical RPG&nbsp;<em>Wildermyth&nbsp;</em>announced this week that with its work on the project complete, it will be going into "hibernation" for the foreseeable future.</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://x.com/wildermyth/status/1795872859232813087" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a post on X (formerly Twitter)</a>, Worldwalker Games isn't being shut down by external forces, and moving on after the completion of work on&nbsp;<em>Wildermyth&nbsp;</em>was "the plan" all along.</p>

<p>Support for the game will continue in the form of crucial updates and bug fixes, but it won't be getting any more content.</p>

<h2>Kerbal Space Program 2 developer Intercept Games is facing layoffs</h2>

<p>Earlier this month, reports emerged that&nbsp;<em>Kerbal Space Program 2&nbsp;</em>developer Intercept Games would be <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/intercept-games-shut-down-kerbal-space-program-2">closed down</a> by its parent company Take-Two Interactive, although said company <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/take-two-denies-roll7-intercept-closure">denied those rumors</a>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/kerbal-space-program-2-gaming-business.jpg?itok=Pn3UIpIY 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/kerbal-space-program-2-gaming-business.jpg?itok=99UeUONp 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Kerbal Space Program 2&nbsp;</em>studio Intercept Games isn't having a great time of things right now.</figcaption></figure><p>This week, however, several Intercept staff members (<a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/intercept-games-facing-layoffs-by-end-of-june" rel="noopener" target="_blank">thanks, GamesIndustry.biz</a>) shared that they would be looking for work soon, with senior design manager Quinn Duffy claiming the whole team at Intercept would be made redundant later in June.</p>

<p>If this is true, then technically speaking, Take-Two head Strauss Zelnick wasn't lying when he said Intercept hadn't been shut down earlier this month, although if he knew the studio would soon be shuttered, it's not a great look.</p>

<h2>ZeniMax is now included in Microsoft's labor neutrality agreement with the CWA</h2>

<p>In some more positive news, the CWA (Communications Workers of America) union announced this week that employees of Bethesda's parent company ZeniMax are now included in Microsoft's labor neutrality agreement with the union.</p>

<p>The agreement was <a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2022/06/13/cwa-and-microsoft-announce-labor-neutrality-agreement/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">originally announced back in 2022</a>, but it <a href="https://x.com/CODE_CWA/status/1796247670517862861" rel="noopener" target="_blank">now includes ZeniMax workers</a>, which gives said staffers the chance to engage with the collective bargaining process alongside their Microsoft colleagues.</p>

<h2>CD Projekt releases its financials for the quarter</h2>

<p>This week also saw the release of <a href="https://www.cdprojekt.com/en/wp-content/uploads-en/2024/05/cd-projekt-group-presentation-q1-2024-4.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank">first-quarter financial information</a> for&nbsp;<em>Witcher 3&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Cyberpunk 2077&nbsp;</em>studio CD Projekt, and sales this quarter were up by 30% when compared to the same period a year ago.</p>

<p>This increase was driven in part by a 94% increase in sales for&nbsp;<em>Cyberpunk 2077&nbsp;</em>and its&nbsp;<em>Phantom Liberty&nbsp;</em>expansion, although sales for games in&nbsp;<em>The Witcher&nbsp;</em>series fell by 41% compared to last year.</p>

<p>We also learned that the next major&nbsp;<em>Witcher&nbsp;</em>game has over 400 staffers working on it, and that no developers at CD Projekt Red are currently working on&nbsp;<em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>, suggesting that the studio is finally done with the game.</p>

<hr><p>That's it for our roundup of this week in gaming business! Join us again next week to find out what's been going on in the industry.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/tabletop/interviews/felicia-day-talks-making-3d-printing-more-inviting-space-with-feliciaday3d</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/felicia-day-talks-making-3d-printing-a-more-inviting-space-with-feliciaday3d.886296/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/interviews/felicia-day-talks-making-3d-printing-more-inviting-space-with-feliciaday3d<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>In the tabletop space, it's hard to think of a revolution for gamers at home larger than 3D Printers becoming so accessible. Whether you are printing terrain, miniatures, organizers for pieces, or wanting to take your games to the real world and printing off cosplay pieces, having a device that can create these gives you options. Options are exactly what Felicia Day is looking to add with her newly launched <a href="https://thangs.com/designer/feliciaday3d">FeliciaDay3D model subscription</a>.</p>

<p>Last week we got to sit down with <a href="https://felicia.day/">Felicia Day</a> - a name many should know from web series <em>The Guild</em>, Geek &amp; Sundry, the originator of <em>Critical Role</em>, and various roles across movies and TV - and talk about her entry into the 3D printing space, how she works and consults with 3D artists, and how working on these projects has rekindled her love with projects that she thought she was burnt out on.</p>

<h2>What is FeliciaDay3D?</h2>

<p>In Day's own words, "FeliciaDay3D is a site you can go to at <a href="https://thangs.com/?sort=trending">thangs.com</a>, you can get a subscription to download 3D models or you can buy things individually. What I do is I design models with really cool designers an we offer those exclusively as well as curating different designers from the web.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"I really have gotten into 3D Printing and fell in love with it. The tinkering aspect and the engineering of it, but also the artistry."</p>
</blockquote>



<h2>Starting In 3D Printing</h2>

<p>In <a href="https://thangs.com/designer/FeliciaDay3D/post/Welcome%20to%20FD3D%21-2713">Felicia Day's original post</a>, I was interested in how she had stated "[she] didn't have a 3D printer at the time, not because [she] didn't want one, but because [she] was intimidated."</p>

<p>Day explained that she had been researching getting a 3D printer, but found examples of places like Reddit where people might ask simple questions like, "How do you get the file into your printer?" and the answers she saw were extremely antagonistic.</p>

<p>"'What are you doing with that stupid comment? There's so many resources on the web,' and I'm like, 'Oh, this is why it's hard to get into this.' You need a doorway opened to you and because I didn't have those training wheels [...] it was really tough," she said.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/feliciaday3d-minis-from-twitter_0.jpg?itok=dlzdW5NK 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/feliciaday3d-minis-from-twitter_0.jpg?itok=29NXOtZd 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Codex and Vork as created by <a href="https://thangs.com/designer/Moonlight%20Minis">Moonlight Minis</a></figcaption></figure><p>Day ran through all of the prep work she put into learning to use her 3D printer, including watching hours of YouTube content on how to set it up, or that I need desiccant in my AMS.</p>

<p>"I feel like I'm a smart person but it's not obvious, there's so many little steps that aren't in the manual," she said. "I'm not about to become a YouTube person to train people on how to do this [...] but I will say the inspiration to get me into the space wasn't there, so I would love to be that person."</p>

<p>Discussing further the differences between her Bamboo X1 Carbon which uses filament and the Anycubic Photon that I have, I couldn't agree with Day more on how complicated the process could be and that my purchase was driven because of the minimal assembly requirement.</p>

<h2>The Creators Behind the Project</h2>

<p>Day was immediately able to show off one of the pieces from FeliciaDay3D, a necklace piece she was wearing that she created with <a href="https://thangs.com/designer/kaizen3dprints">Kaizen 3D</a> prints. While the version Day was wearing was black, she was also able to show off the Mother's Day version that is printed in different blues and greens.</p>

<p>"That's the great thing about 3D printing," she said. "You can take the recipe and you can tweak it to be however you want."</p>

<p>An aspect of FeliciaDay3D that I did have to compliment was that each product image clearly stated the designer's name and the descriptions also all link to the creator's Thangs profile page. Day even pointed out to me that on the bases of the creations, there were the creator's initials so even after printing that credit can be found.</p>



<p>"I'm not into modeling and am collaborating doing mood boards or inspiration boards and then we go back and forth," Day described.</p>

<p>Talking about how Day connected with each of these creators, the full credit went to Thangs. "[They] approached me to do this project and I had been very wary to do big collaborative projects with people ever since Geek &amp; Sundry, I was really burnt out mentally and physically," she said. "It's been five years since I left it and I've been doing my own stuff. [...] Because it's an area I really wanted to get into, because my daughter is really into it.</p>

<p>"Paul from Thangs approached me [...] and was like, 'Hey, you seem to have a huge passion for this, [...] here's a printer, let's get started and we will facilitate the relationship that you have with these designers.'"</p>

<p>Day walked me through the process from the beginning where certain creators were pitched to her, and she found different art and minis that she liked the look of. Today, she spends daily time looking at creators' work, trying to find a way that FeliciaDay3D can benefit while also providing full credit to the creators to create a "circulatory system where we all rise to the top."</p>

<p>Day spoke about how approaching 3D printing with these designers has also helped to reinvigorate a passion that she thought she had lost.</p>

<p>"Quite frankly, I was totally burnt out on my show <em>The Guild</em>, it's been like eight years since I worked on it," she said. "The fact that I worked with Christine (Moonlight Minis) to recreate these guys and write description I realized I'm not as burnt out on them as I thought."</p>

<h2>Who is FeliciaDay3D for?</h2>

<p>To focus in on what type of person should be keeping an eye out on her page, Day simply explained that "there are three different demographics of things we're doing because they're my personal interests: Cosplay &amp; Jewelry, Minis, and Toys to make with your kids."</p>

<p>For Day it was important that the designs created for FeliciaDay3D were accessible to people new to the space.</p>

<p>"I have a passion for taking something that's a little bit inaccessible and making it more public for people to get into," she said. "We do have prints that are 30 minutes and they're out, one color and you're done. But then you can do the necklace, which is printed onto fabric, or print minis on your resin printer."</p>

<h2>Subscription Benefits and Future Releases</h2>

<p>For subscribers to FeliciaDay3D, you'll be able to get access to new creations every month. Each month Day plans to add two minis, more jewelry, and toys. There is also a subscription tier that allows for the reselling of printed minis from FeliciaDay3D.</p>

<p>For next month, Day was able to reveal to me that there would be two more members of<em> The Guild</em> who would be added to the page, as well as astrology pendants for Gemini, Leo, and Virgo. Next month would also have a charity initiative added to coincide with Day's birthday. For all purchases of the charity print, a substantial portion would be donated to charity.&nbsp;</p>

<p>After completing adding minis for <em>The Guild</em> and the Axis of Anarchy, Day teased that she has another project she's interested in for minis. Day thought to herself, "Wouldn't it be cool to see a mini like that," and now there are plans to not just create those minis but even write a module around it.</p>



<h2>3D Printing Is Still A New Space</h2>

<p>Day is hoping, as her platform grows, that she can reach out to designers who might not be in the 3D space for collaborations. "I'd love to work with jewelry designers or RPG and Tabletop who work in other mediums. Maybe it's the step that they need to get into the space.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"This is about collaboration, exploration, and creativity. Wherever we can make cool things with technology, I want to be there."&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Speaking more to her personal history being on the forefront of technology, Day explained, "<em>The Guild</em> took off because we were one of the first shows on YouTube, the iPhone came out the year later and blew up social media. Being early in tech is something I have a passion for because it's the most creatively fertile time.</p>

<p>"Now I think 3D Printers are accessible enough that that can be a tool for people, and I am excited to be along for the ride," she said.</p>

<p>While only able to offer things that she is the IP holder of, Day also had some interesting observations about licensed product from franchises like <em>Pokemon </em>or <em>Harry Potter</em> that are so present on 3D model websites.</p>

<p>"I think as the fan projects get out there, it's going to become more high profile and push the companies to satisfy the need of the people," she said. "Maybe they'll discover new aspects of their own IP because of fans. I love it when grass roots push bigger companies to change.</p>

<p>"Of course, probably in 5-10 years the big companies will say, 'We're going to take over,' but the stronger the individual creators are now, the more power they'll have when that inevitably happens."</p>



<h2>Empowering Her Daughter and Other Women Interested in 3D Printing</h2>

<p>One thing that Day wanted to make sure fans of hers understand from this project is that "it's really not as hard as it looks."</p>

<p>"The reputation is a lot more engineering based [...] but once the technology becomes more accessible to a plug-and-play kind of mind, then people are going to come in and approach it from a different way," she said.</p>

<p>"One of the first things I printed, I got a jam, I was printing two filaments that shouldn't have gone together," Day said. "I did get a warning, but I was like 'meh' and it got a clog. I was like, 'Felicia, calm down this is mechanical, people do this all the time,' and I took everything apart.</p>

<p>"Some people are like 'eye roll, you used a wrench' but yeah this is a big deal for me. The fact that I was able to get that thing unstuck without asking for any help was so liberating, and I felt powerful and then I made something with it."</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"The fact that I was able to get that thing unstuck without asking for any help was so liberating and I felt powerful."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Day revealed that the first thing she printed was the Pokemon<em> </em>Wooper for her daughter; the second attempt was successful and she was "Mom of the Year."</p>

<p>Day joked that replacing everything in her house with a 3D print is not her life passion, but she does want to create pretty things. "Getting others, especially women and girls, into a place that's very male-dominated" is also important for Day.</p>

<p>She did remark that there was no specific intent behind it, but that's "just who I am." Her aim is to be the person at the door to let others in and show that it can be very fun.</p>

<p>"The earlier you get a kid into it the better, so we can have more girls like my little girl coming home and saying, 'I love making things Mama, I want to build things, I want to design my own things.' That's going to lead to all kinds of benefits down the line," she said.</p>

<p>"There's a lot of layers going on, and at the end of the day, I just want to make a spider wearing a party hat."</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/the-wayward-realms-kickstarter-qa-there-are-plenty-of-ways-to-advance-procedural-generation/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>It was early August 2021 when former Elder Scrolls Arena and Elder Scrolls Daggerfall developers Ted Peterson and Julian LeFay <a href="https://wccftech.com/open-world-fantasy-rpg-the-wayward-realms-briefly-showcased-made-by-ex-elder-scrolls-developers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> they had partnered to create The Wayward Realms at their new studio, OnceLost Games.</p>
<p>Nearly three years later, the developers have just <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/oncelostgames/the-wayward-realms" target="_blank" rel="noopener">opened a Kickstarter campaign</a> to raise funds for their 'Grand RPG', which aims to hearken back to the old-school of games like Daggerfall, which featured massive open worlds and a strong emphasis on choices and consequences.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, the campaign has already earned nearly half the minimum funding goal of $500K. With 29 days left, The Wayward Realms will likely be funded, and there may even be space for some stretch goals, which are currently set for $800K, $1 million, $1.5 million, and $2 million, with the last one including multiplayer support.</p>
<p>Ahead of the Kickstarter campaign, we sent a few questions to OnceLost Games to discuss their approach to the project and the main features you can expect to see when it lands in early access next year.</p>
<p><iframe title="Life of An Adventurer - A Gameplay Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/r3XXGVCEhNI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>

<p><strong>As far as I can see, Julian hasn't worked in the industry for a long time. Why did he choose to come back now?</strong></p>
<p>After Julian did an interview about The Elder Scrolls with Indigo Gaming, Ted Peterson reached out to Indigo and did an interview as well. Through him, Julian and Ted got back in touch with each other and began talking about what they would have done had they continued working more hands on with the series. Eventually, they decided to give it a try, and thus, OnceLost Games was born.</p>
<p><strong>OnceLost Games was founded in 2019. Were you affected by the COVID pandemic, leading to a delay in the development process?</strong></p>
<p>The biggest effects were on team members' personal lives which did lead to a rough start for the company. It was early on enough that there wasnât any delay, per se, but things did take a little longer to get going.</p>
<p><strong>What's the project's status, and how many developers do you have currently?</strong></p>
<p>We are currently a team of around 40 members. We are still in early production with the aim of the Kickstarter campaign allowing us to work full time for a year to get an early access version of the game out to supporters.</p>
<p><strong>You're now looking to create an early access build of The Wayward Realms with the funds from the Kickstarter. How long do you expect it to take before this build can go live in early access following the end of the campaign?</strong></p>
<p>Our aim is for an early access release sometime in 2025, but it is hard to nail down a more specific date at this time as some of that will be affected by how much we manage to raise.</p>
<p><strong>Moreover, do you have an estimate for how long the game will stay in early access before the full launch?</strong></p>
<p>That will depend on how easily we are able to find additional funding after the early access launch.</p>
<p><strong>The Wayward Realms is being billed as a spiritual successor to The Elder Scrolls II: Daggerfall. That game's biggest achievement was arguably its procedural generation, which, in some ways, may still be unmatched by modern games. Why do you think that is the case, and how will you advance it with this new game?</strong></p>
<p>Daggerfallâs open world is often cited as wide as an ocean but deep as a puddle, which is something that can certainly happen when procedural generation is implemented in a simple form. This probably scares off most developers who would rather have a smaller, more detailed world for their players to engage with. However, we feel that there are plenty of ways to advance the procedural generation and integrate more memorable interactions and encounters within it.<br>
We are also taking advantage of procedural generation in order to be able to change things within the world, such as a town being burned down to the ground as a result of the political struggle.</p>
<p><strong>Are you using Unreal Engine 5.3's Procedural Content Generation feature? In general, how can a cutting-edge game-making tool like UE5 empower your work?</strong></p>
<p>We have not upgraded to 5.3 yet, but we do plan to. In the end we will take advantage of some of that systems features, but will primarily be sticking with our own, as we are needing the proc gen to work at runtime and we are also creating a curvature to the world, so that as you sail or climb a high location, then you can see distant landmarks come into view properly.</p>
<p><strong>Can you talk about the virtual Game Master?</strong></p>
<p>The VGM is meant to work like a real life tabletop game master would, tailoring the game around the player, who/what they are playing as, and what they enjoy doing. For instance, a player who collects books may be offered more quests with books as a reward to entice them. Meanwhile, a melee-focused player may be offered more challenges based on their melee skills. The idea is to track what the player is doing and avoid offering more of what the player is not doing.</p>
<p>The VGM is also in charge of creating new quests for players, taking into account recent events, NPCs that the player has interacted with, and what factions the player is allied with and against in order to fill in the variables in potential quests. This helps make the game more relevant to the player in each playthrough.</p>
<p><strong>You've stated that, in a way, there is no main quest in your game. Given that, is it fair to say the game has no specific end, and events will continue to unfold without limit?</strong></p>
<p>There is no main quest, but we do have major World Events that occur throughout a playthrough. They act as sort of an overarching narrative. There are also questlines for each of the major factions. With both of these there will be a sort of finality to a narrative for players, but they can continue to play one beyond them, and the VGMs will continue to create new adventures for the player to experience.</p>
<p><strong>Will the game feature Radiant AI-like proc-gen quests, and if so, how do you plan to make them more interesting?</strong></p>
<p>There will be a lot of procedurally generated quests. Part of the goal for the VGM is to make sure they are interesting to the player by including recent events and NPC &amp; Faction interactions in order to keep them relevant. We are also building quests in a 5 act structure, thus making sure that they have a proper narrative beat and can be more interesting.</p>
<p><strong>Speaking of AI, what do you think about generative AI NPCs? Could they make RPGs more interesting, especially for side content?</strong></p>
<p>It is something we are exploring, but in order to ensure that they would fit the world, they would have to have some strict limitations.</p>
<p><strong>Can you describe how spellcrafting will work in The Wayward Realms?</strong></p>
<p>We are not ready to go into depth about it, but part of the gameplay loop of being a mage is seeking out new words to use in spell creation. Different combinations will allow for various effects and more rare words will lead to more powerful spells.</p>
<p><strong>Since the game is set in an archipelago and ships have been confirmed, will there be ship combat? What about any content under the sea (e.g., explorable ruins)?</strong></p>
<p>Ship combat is something we are still discussing. There is no gunpowder in our world, so cannons would not fit. We do also want undersea exploration, but that is something we have yet to touch on with our procedural systems. Both to be determined.</p>
<p><strong>You mentioned traditional 'click-to-attack combat'. Is that a reference to MMO-style 'tab targeting'?</strong></p>
<p>No, we mean the difference between todayâs combat, where clicking the mouse button results in an attack, and Daggerfall-style combat, where the mouse is dragged in order to produce a swing.</p>
<p><strong>When describing 'directional combat', you referred to mouse and keyboard. Are you also going to support gamepads? Will this mode support manual aiming of bows and spells and other action elements like dodging, blocking, et cetera?</strong></p>
<p>We do already support gamepads even in this early stage. Bows and spells are aimed manually in both instances. Dodging and kicking are bound to specific keys. Blocking can be affected by the direction inputs.</p>
<p><strong>For those who aren't fond of combat, is it possible to be a crafter-type character who sends companions and allies to do their dirty work?</strong></p>
<p>There will be non-combat options, such as dialogue options. Companions are something we would like, but we are not sure if we will get in on time yet.</p>
<p><strong>In a previous interview from 2021, you said there might be a lot of reading in the game due to budget constraints. Has that changed at all (e.g., will there be more voice acting than anticipated)?</strong></p>
<p>No, we donât really plan for voice acting besides some greetings, grunts, background noise, and battle cries. The procedural nature of some quests, as well as how much dialogue we have planned, makes having full voice acting virtually impossible. We might have text-to-speech available as more of an accessibility option.</p>
<p><strong>Similarly, you mentioned romances and the like would not be a focus. Is that still the case?</strong></p>
<p>It is something we are exploring, but nothing is set in stone yet.</p>
<p><strong>I know you've said the main goal of The Wayward Realms is to restore the design philosophies of classic RPGs. However, I wanted to ask if there's anything you'd like to borrow from the best examples of most recent RPGs, like Baldur's Gate 3. What do you think about Larian's game and its overwhelming success?</strong></p>
<p>We have many huge fans of the game and Larian themselves on the team. Ultimately, BG3 is a different type of game than what we are making, but some inspiration has undoubtedly seeped in here or there.</p>
<p><strong>Will there be any mini-games in The Wayward Realms?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, we do plan some different types of tavern games, such as card or board games, as well as some tourney type games like jousting or dueling, and of course the ever-requested fishing mini game will make an appearance.</p>
<p><strong>What do you think about Bethesda's latest game, Starfield? Some players thought the usual sense of exploration found in a Bethesda game was kinda lost in it. Was it simply inevitable due to it being set in space (and, as such, locations had to be spread across many planets)?</strong></p>
<p>The game was enjoyable but took a different approach to procedural generation from ours. We feel it would have benefited from having some Daggerfall-esque âdungeonâ generation instead of reusing premade dungeons.</p>
<p><strong>Bethesda is now working on The Elder Scrolls VI, and there's a chance the full version of The Wayward Realms may be released in its vicinity. How would you feel about that?</strong></p>
<p>We are not really sure what the release dates for either game will ultimately be, but we donât mind if we release alongside. There really is a big difference in the two gamesâ design philosophies and we think there is room for both. Some players will gravitate more towards one than the other, and we think that having the option is great.</p>
<p><strong>Do you plan to bring The Wayward Realms to consoles eventually?</strong></p>
<p>We would certainly love to, but right now, we are solely focused on getting this out on PC.</p>
<p><strong>The Steam page currently lists very low minimum requirements, especially for the GPU. Are those meant to be placeholders, or are they accurate for the time being?</strong></p>
<p>They are simply placeholders, as Steam requires something to be filled in. We will release more accurate specs as we near launch.</p>
<p><strong>Will The Wayward Realms eventually be available on all major PC stores (Steam, GOG, and Epic Games Store)?</strong></p>
<p>We do plan on it, yes.</p>
<p><strong>What do you think about the industry's current state, with countless games vying for users' attention, mass layoffs, and rising development budgets?</strong></p>
<p>It is sad to see studios being shuttered and games being canceled. Hopefully things can pick back up relatively quickly. It does open up more room for indies, so that can be taken as a plus.</p>
<p><strong>Thank you for your time.</strong></p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/selaco-sets-new-standard-for-fps-genre</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/selaco-sets-a-new-standard-for-the-fps-genre.886290/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/selaco-sets-new-standard-for-fps-genre<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/features/every-game-techraptor-scored-10-10">10/10 score</a> from <em>TechRaptor</em> is a rare honor reserved for only the best of the best, and we take great care to scrutinize every aspect of a game deserving of this score. Believe me when I say, then, that I would fight tooth and nail for <em>Selaco</em> to receive such a distinction, were it not <em>just </em>releasing in Early Access.</p>

<p>As it stands, <em>Selaco</em> is one of the most original and innovative retro-inspired shooters to hit the market in quite some time, with a cornucopia of highly polished mechanics and fresh ideas. It even has a full episode available to play on Early Access now, and that already feels like a full product in and of itself. <em>Selaco</em> is setting the bar for shooters ludicrously high.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/selaco-guns-1.jpg?itok=xwREw6M7 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/selaco-guns-1.jpg?itok=AnaZa1j- 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Ol' reliable, this gun. Keep it loaded.</figcaption></figure><h2><em>Selaco</em>'s Introduction is Thrilling and Engrossing</h2>

<p><em>Selaco </em>takes notes from some of my favorite shooters -- there are hints of <em><a href="https://techraptor.net/series/halo">Halo</a>,</em> a hearty helping of <em>F.E.A.R.</em>, some <a href="https://techraptor.net/series/doom"><em>Doom </em></a>DNA of course (it runs on GZDoom, for goodness' sake), and several others. Even so, it's a first-person shooter that feels like its own thing rather than imitating its inspirations. As a result, it's undeniably the most fun I've had with an FPS campaign in years.</p>

<p>The action ramps up right from the start as <em>Selaco</em>'s main character, Dawn, wakes up in her hospital bed, and all has gone to hell in a handbasket. Your first moments as Dawn are a desperate rush to find a weapon as an unknown force attacks anyone unfortunate enough to find themselves in its way.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/selaco-weapon-sprites.jpg?itok=rGVq1iO8 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/selaco-weapon-sprites.jpg?itok=pqOwNGZu 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Weapon models look excellent. I wouldn't want to be at the end of this shotgun.</figcaption></figure><p>This took me back to Master Chief's mad dash to Captain Keyes in <em>Halo: Combat Evolved</em>, a moment seared into my brain. Eventually, you find your weapon and it's all gas, no breaks from start to finish. The moment you grab that rifle, a team of soldiers clad in tactical armor start breaching the door and rush in.</p>

<p>As you fight your way out of this situation, you'll gather up armor that gives Dawn a slide and dash, and come across many other weapons, too. The gunplay, and by extension, the enemies you fight, is where <em>Selaco</em> sets itself apart. Every single weapon, from your ridiculously powerful pistol to a gun that blasts nails at high speeds is a powerhouse that looks and feels incredible to use.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/selaco-firefight-2.jpg?itok=Y2I4894P 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/selaco-firefight-2.jpg?itok=ZXqyPzLG 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>When in doubt, spray bullets in their face.</figcaption></figure><h2><em>Selaco's </em>AI is Smart and Lethal</h2>

<p>With the mobility added by your suit, combat is fast and deadly. Enemies are lethal and a miscalculation will quite literally mean your death. This isn't the type of FPS where you're taking on dozens of enemies in the same room; rather, <em>Selaco</em> uses highly intelligent, efficient killing squads as the primary enemy.</p>

<p>As such, the AI in <em>Selaco</em> is one of the most advanced I've come across in a shooter. This is where you can see the <em>F.E.A.R. </em>inspiration, with enemies calling out tactics to their comrades and reacting to the player's actions. Some squads are more aggressive than others, while others will be more hesitant to engage if you push. Hide in a corner, though, and you bet they'll be on you in no time.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/selaco-sniper.jpg?itok=zn1Z7_li 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/selaco-sniper.jpg?itok=dP_UYuRx 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The enemy is tactically taking cover, but we'll see if he can stand a sniper bullet.</figcaption></figure><p>There are few games that capture the intensity of a gunfight, but <em>Selaco</em> does that. Not that I've ever <em>been</em> in a firefight myself, but the gunplay and AI go a long way to make things feel immersive. Things get <em>very</em> chaotic in these gunfights, as there is clutter everywhere. Just about every object can be shot and explodes in a violent fashion, and the smoke and debris from the chaos can limit your field of vision.</p>

<p>In a stroke of brilliance, <em>Selaco</em> gradually ups the ante of these firefights by its inclusion of "Invasion Tiers." As you progress throughout the campaign, enemies are upgraded with more abilities and armaments. Therefore, even though you might see similar enemies throughout, there's almost always going to be something new to contend with. As a result, <em>Selaco</em> feels fresh from start to finish.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/selaco-map.jpg?itok=Te2cpTca 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/selaco-map.jpg?itok=MOizc6pS 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The maps in Selaco are especially helpful and mark crucial points.</figcaption></figure><h2>Collectibles and Other Fun Tasks in <em>Selaco</em></h2>

<p>Levels are intricate and meticulously detailed in <em>Selaco</em>. From the starting hospital to the abandoned, sci-fi streets of&nbsp;the eponymous Selaco, you'll explore numerous environments that I couldn't help but stop and gawk at. There are so many hidden secrets and collectibles in these vast complexes. Despite the ambitious scope of such levels, I never felt lost, which is a testament to <em>Selaco</em>'s level design.</p>

<p>After firefights, I'd run around and explore these environments. <em>Selaco</em> certainly embraces those with an intrepid spirit. You'll be surprised by what you find; weapon upgrades, caches of ammo, various currencies, and more. Weapon upgrades often come in the form of a new alt-fire for your guns, so there's more variation to your roster of 8 or so weapons.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/selaco-challenges.jpg?itok=QqxLPcgh 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/selaco-challenges.jpg?itok=yOoHoDW2 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>You'll find that you are rewarded for your efforts.</figcaption></figure><p>Other than that, it's great to explore since you can upgrade weapons further at safe houses scattered throughout <em>Selaco</em>'s campaign. Weapon parts are hidden throughout, and this is the primary currency you'll use to fund your customization. Increasing the damage of your weapons or altering the accuracy, recoil, and behavior of weapons is essential when faced with an ever-evolving enemy.</p>

<p>While I normally don't care all that much about searching for secrets, <em>Selaco</em> makes the hunt especially fun and rewarding. Often, this game rewards your ingenuity. Stacking chairs to get to a high ledge or crawling through a series of vents does not go unrewarded.</p>

<p>Besides that, players progress the more they play, plain and simple: <em>Selaco</em> has a series of milestones that reward the player with weapon parts. Often, these milestones ask you to kill a certain number of enemies or break a specific amount of walls. It's another way for players to get a sense of progression and gratification as they shoot their way to victory.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/selaco-upgrades.jpg?itok=46Aaa2Ea 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/selaco-upgrades.jpg?itok=lTHsnbsr 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Upgrade weapons to your liking, provided you have the dosh.</figcaption></figure><h2><em>Selaco</em>'s Running on <em>that</em> Engine?</h2>

<p>Believe me when I say <em>Selaco</em> is a technical marvel. No, I'm not a game dev, but consider this:<em> </em>this game<em> </em>is running on a modified <em>Doom </em>engine, known as <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/supplice-works-some-gzdoom-magic">GZDoom</a>. GZDoom games usually come with a noticeably retro look, but <em>Selaco</em> has a fine balance of retro and modern elements. This creates a wholly original style, so there's nothing that is quite like <em>Selaco </em>on the market, visually speaking.</p>

<p>Altered Orbit must have done some dark magic to make <em>Selaco</em> look and play the way it does. Running on GZDoom, you'd think it would play a bit like <em>Doom </em>or boomer shooters, right? That's simply not the case, here. I cannot begin to imagine the amount of work it took to accomplish such a feat, but I can at least appreciate the developer's ingenuity.</p>

The arcade machines have actual games on them, and hell, I played pool at a bar in between firefights. There are random bits of food that can heal you, and office supplies you can chuck at enemies if you'd like, too. The bathrooms? Well, they're fully functional, toilet, sink, soap dispenser, and all.</p>

<p>The result of these efforts is a treat for both the eyes and ears. In fact, the soundtrack is simply superb. It has this slick, electronic vibe that fits oh so well with the science-fiction aesthetic. I would get so hyped up when a squad of enemies was coming my way, and you have this fantastic, adrenaline-pumping soundtrack complementing the intensity of the combat.</p>

<p>There's a lot more I could say about <em>Selaco</em>, and all of it is positive. Again, you might be reading this and forget that this is an Early Access game -- it's not technically Version 1.0. With Episode 2 marking the completion of Early Access and a third episode following that, I cannot wait to see what else <em>Selaco</em> has in store.</p>

<p>If you'd rather wait 'til its out of Early Access, you're doing yourself a disservice. Go and play <em>Selaco</em> now. You won't regret it.</p>

<hr><p><em><strong>Selaco </strong>was previewed on PC via Steam Early Access with a code provided by the developer over roughly 15 hours of gameplay - all screenshots were taken during the preview process.</em></p>

<h2 id="24DuNp"><strong>Barely Even Friends by Mae Bennett</strong></h2>
<h3 id="UWG237"><strong>June 4</strong></h3>
<p id="Ow8RYM">If youâre in the mood to read a steamy, contemporary retelling of <em>Beauty and the Beast</em>, look no further than Mae Bennettâs debut romance novel, <em>Barely Even Friends</em>. </p>
<p id="rWhtk7">A contractor by trade and expert in all things to do with home renovation, Bellamy Price is determined to get a leg up and prove herself in a typically male-dominated field. Luckily, the perfect opportunity presents itself when sheâs offered a job working on the palatial and mysterious Killington Estate. Expecting the house to be empty upon her arrival, Bellamy is shocked to discover itâs occupied by none other than Oliver Killington, recluse and heir to the vast Killington empire, who happens to have a very convenient <em>thing</em> for suspenders. Though frustratingly obstinate at first, it quickly becomes clear that thereâs more to Oliver than meets the eye, and a common enemy quickly brings him and Bellamy closer together than either are expecting. </p>

<h3 id="7NNJ0y"><strong>June 4</strong></h3>
<p id="kzTxMJ">From the author of <em>Elder Race</em> and <em>Children of Time</em> comes a new, surprisingly funny and deeply philosophical sci-fi novel about a murderous robot valet by the name of Charles thatâs perfect for fans of <em>I, Robot</em> and <em>Jeeves</em>. </p>
<p id="cy5fYC">When Charles, a robot valet meticulously designed to be at the right hand of any modern human, gets the idea to murder their master â and subsequently does â theyâre forced to go on the run, something they never thought theyâd be able to do. Charles quickly discovers that the world is much larger than the home they worked in, and that theyâre not the only robot discovering their independence. </p>

<h2 id="aOtkCx"><strong>The Stardust Grail by Yume Kitasei</strong></h2>
<h3 id="qchmQW"><strong>June 11</strong></h3>
<p id="a6DwIO">Itâs hard not to be incredibly excited about <em>The Stardust Grail</em>, a book thatâs pitched as an anti-colonial space heist with a protagonist who returns stolen artifacts to the alien civilizations they belong to rather than keeping them for herself or putting them behind glass in a museum. </p>
<p id="nMsqNO">Set ten years after a job goes horribly wrong, Maya Hoshimoto â once considered to be the galaxyâs best art thief â is approached by an old friend with an offer she canât refuse: track down an powerful alien artifact. The catch? The artifact in question might not actually exist, and if it does, its discovery could lead to the end of human civilization as we know it. </p>

<h2 id="64lW0p"><strong>The Art Of Catching Feelings by Alicia Thompson</strong></h2>
<h3 id="K0zoYu"><strong>June 18</strong></h3>
<p id="xsrtMA">What better time to read a romance novel about baseball than during the height of summer? </p>
<p id="EeGVS8">In Alicia Thompsonâs novel, <em>The Art of Catching Feelings</em>, a professional baseball player and his number one heckler navigate a delightful enemies-to-lovers romance. When Daphne Brink takes her taunting a little too far, driving Chris Kepler to literal tears during the middle of a game, she reaches out over social media to apologize. When Chris messages her back, it quickly becomes clear that he doesnât know who Daphne is, and their relationship begins to grow into more than a few sweet DMs. But as the season progresses and their feelings for one another become undeniable, Daphne realizes she might not be able to keep her true identity from Chris forever. </p>

<h2 id="U7qJSw"><strong>The Daughtersâ War by Christopher Buehlman</strong></h2>
<h3 id="1hGfWI"><strong>June 25</strong></h3>
<p id="rJTNm7">I have been counting down the days until the release of <em>The Daughtersâ War</em> since I first caught wind that Christopher Buehlman would be writing a prequel to his fantastic fantasy novel, <em>The Blacktongue Thief</em>. Rather than return to the lush world that heâs crafted with a sequel (weâll see Kinch again eventually), Buehlman is taking readers back in time with a tale about Galva as she rides into battle against goblins on the back of her war-corvid. </p>

<h2 id="hXH8hp"><strong>The God of the Woods by Liz Moore</strong></h2>
<h3 id="iMjSB0"><strong>July 2</strong></h3>
<p id="O7n6Mz">Set in the Adirondack Mountains during the late summer of 1975, <em>The God of the Woods</em> tells the story of 13-year-old Barbara Van Laar, who vanishes from her bunk overnight while at summer camp. Barbara isnât just any camper though, and this isnât the first time a Van Laar has gone missing. Sixteen years ago, Barbaraâs older brother also vanished too, never to be seen again. </p>
<p id="qbRJH3">This is a gorgeously written and tragic tale with a non-linear plot that jumps through time from the 1950s to the 1970s as Moore transports her readers, weaving a rich and complicated tapestry. </p>

<h2 id="UrNiXi"><strong>The Undermining of Twyla and Frank by Megan Bannen</strong></h2>
<h3 id="8ulDoU"><strong>July 2</strong></h3>
<p id="RGhs2f">Hot off the heels of her first heartwarming romance novel, <em>The Undertaking of Hart and Mercy</em>, Megan Bannen returns to the magical world of Tanria with its friends-to-lovers sequel, <em>The Undermining of Twyla and Frank</em>. </p>
<p id="UBUDZ8">Itâs fair to say the entire town of Eternity was shocked when Twyla Banneker, middle-aged and a widow, joined her best friend, Frank Ellis, to be a Tanrian marshal. But, eight years later, Twyla is still at it (and very good at her job, to boot). Her life takes a sudden and exciting turn when she and Frank discover the dead body of one of their fellow marshals covered in â of all things â glitter. As Twyla and Frank are drawn further into the mystery afoot, it becomes increasingly clear that the two are much more than just work partners. </p>

<h2 id="ZFWEaA"><strong>Pink Slime by Fernanda TrÃ­as </strong></h2>
<h3 id="Rw0gnS"><strong>July 2</strong></h3>
<p id="wc8pZs">Set in a not-to-distant future in which the world has been utterly devastated by a plague, <em>Pink Slime</em> by Fernanda TrÃ­as is a deeply distressing but compulsively readable work of climate fiction. </p>
<p id="mtFf0t">When a mysterious algae bloom poisons the air blowing inland from the ocean, a nameless corporation develops a vile pink food substance â think Pepto Bismol crossed with Soylent Green â for everyone to eat. As the end of the world grows ever closer and society continues to collapse, one woman in particular â the narrator of this story â refuses to leave the family and friends she loves behind, clinging to the life she once knew. </p>

<h2 id="xz8lK8"><strong>Toward Eternity by Anton Hur </strong></h2>
<h3 id="KBFiF9"><strong>July 9</strong></h3>
<p id="oxNyYQ">Already a force to be reckoned with in the world of literary translation, Anton Hurâs upcoming novel, <em>Toward Eternity</em>, is a brilliant and thought provoking examination of what it means to be human. </p>
<p id="3TelnI">Told in the form of journal entries that connect characters across centuries, <em>Toward Eternity</em> is set in a world where cancerous cells can be replaced by nanites â robotic cells â effectively eradicating the disease. Itâs nothing short of a miracle. At the same time, a literary researcher and the doctor who holds the patent to nano-technology join forces to place an AI program into a physical, robotic form, effectively giving it bodily autonomy and bringing mortality and humanity into question in the process. </p>

<h2 id="pEnvd1"><strong>Navola by Paolo Bacigalupi </strong></h2>
<h3 id="OgRwEa"><strong>July 9</strong></h3>
<p id="Wj0QCj">Fans of <em>Windup Girl</em>, <em>The Water Knife</em>, and <em>Shipbreaker</em>, rejoice! An exciting new science fiction title from Paolo Bacigalupi is hitting shelves in July. </p>
<p id="CfrL2V">Set in an Italian Renaissance-inspired world, <em>Navolo</em> is a mashup of literary scifi/fantasy and historical fiction that tells the story of Davico di Regulai, a young lord set to take over his familyâs vast empire. The di Regulai family are wealthy beyond belief and have influenced the rise and fall of politicians and great cities alike, but not everything in the city of Navola is as it seems. When Davico discovers the existence of a fossilized dragon eye â a symbol of raw power that is pictured on <em>Navolaâs</em> excellent cover â he finds that there are few he can trust, including members of his own family. </p>

<h2 id="vJqxLe"><strong>The Sky On Fire by Jenn Lyons</strong></h2>
<h3 id="IbLMVW"><strong>July 9</strong></h3>
<p id="O42yxv">Billed as <em>Dragonriders of Pern</em> but for modern readers, <em>The Sky on Fire</em> promises to be exactly what fans of <em>Temeraire</em>, <em>Fourth Wing</em>, and even Patricia C. Wredeâs beloved <em>Dealing With Dragons</em> are craving. </p>
<p id="8eNOOE">After being saved from a local warlord by a group of unlikely adventuring misfits â picture an average D&amp;D party â Anahrod realizes that her new companions are determined to reach the cloud cities and the immense dragonâs hoard located there.  The only problem with this plan is that the hoard belongs to Neveranimas, and Neveranimas wants nothing more than to see Anahrod dead. </p>

<h2 id="0SPWeH"><strong>Nicked by M.T. Anderson </strong></h2>
<h3 id="dhPNLg"><strong>July 23</strong></h3>
<p id="1D18sR">If thereâs one thing about M.T. Anderson, itâs that heâs going to write a book with a plot thatâs as delightful and captivating as it is downright strange. His adult debut <em>Nicked</em> is no exception. </p>
<p id="EQinH9">In the year 1801, the Italian port city of Bari is wracked by a plague, and a monk by the name of Brother Nicephorus is visited by Saint Nicholas in his dreams. His superiors donât believe him, but Tyun, a treasure hunter, does and the two soon hit the road to collect Saint Nicholasâs bones and the mysterious liquid they rest in, which is rumored to heal the sick. What follows is a heist that is complex and action packed enough to make even the likes of Steven Soderbergh jealous. </p>

<h2 id="xik4N6"><strong>Long Live Evil by Sarah Rees Brennan </strong></h2>
<h3 id="rUxOpc"><strong>July 30</strong></h3>
<p id="3zzVje">Sarah Rees Brennanâs adult debut,<em> Long Live Evil</em>, proves that sometimes it feels good to be a little bad. </p>
<p id="QfzaNW">Rae is dying, no ifs, ands, or buts about it. As her world comes crumbling down around her, she makes a last ditch magical bargain that transports her to the court of her favorite fictional character, the Once and Forever Emperor. The catch? Rae isnât the hero of this story. Quite the opposite, in fact. As the emperor becomes increasingly violent, Rae assembles an unlikely team of villainous allies who deserve a much better ending than the one originally written for them. </p>

<h2 id="Injzmw"><strong>The Mercy of Gods by James S.A. Corey</strong></h2>
<h2 id="6NLxzX"><strong>August 6</strong></h2>
<p id="WOfdXd">James S.A. Corey, the dynamic duo behind the phenomenal series, <em>The Expanse</em>, is back once again for a brand new, utterly epic sci-fi adventure. </p>
<p id="P6jV76">For generations, the Carryx â a combination of an empire and a hive â have waged wars and enslaved alien species across the galaxy. They are a force to be reckoned with to say the least, but when they finally meet their match, it becomes clear that the best and brightest humans living on the planet Anjiin are the only ones who can save them. The result is a gripping tale of survival, rebellion, and hope. </p>

<h2 id="g94KaF"><strong>Loving, Ohio by Matthew Erman and illustrated by Sam Beck </strong></h2>
<h3 id="63vUFW"><strong>August 6</strong></h3>
<p id="4CM11b">Itâs safe to say that <em>Loving, Ohio</em> â written by Matthew Erman and gorgeously illustrated by Sam Beck â is my favorite horror graphic novel that Iâve read since Emily Carrollâs In <em>The Woods</em>. Itâs a perfectly balanced mix of punk rock, small town coming-of-age, and bone chilling, nightmare fueling dread. </p>
<p id="vLHj98">After the shocking suicide of their friend, four teens are grief stricken, unmoored, and counting down the days until high school comes to an end. Thereâs not much for them in Loving anyways, besides the mysterious new age cult known as the Chorus that has taken root there. When tragedy strikes again, the group canât help but wonder if the Chorus is somehow behind it, and one in particular, Sloane, is hell-bent on finding out the truth, no matter the coast. </p>

<h2 id="EISzbQ"><strong>A Sorceress Comes to Call by T Kingfisher </strong></h2>
<h3 id="EXHHG9"><strong>August 6</strong></h3>
<p id="dClvc1">T. Kingfisher has outdone herself once again, proving to sci-fi and fantasy readers alike why sheâs one of the best in the biz. A retelling inspired by the Brothers Grimm fairytale <em>Goose Girl</em>, <em>A Sorceress Comes to Call</em> is a bewitching and wildly entertaining adventure. </p>
<p id="HPjKKL">Cordelia has not had an easy life. Raised by a domineering, emotionally manipulative and downright abusive mother in a house without any doors, and with only a beautiful white horse for a friend, Cordelia craves a freedom sheâs certain sheâll never have. When a death in town forces the two women to go on the run in the middle of the night, they find themselves seeking shelter with a wealthy man, his unwed sister, Hester, and a squire. When Hester recognizes the pain and torment that Cordelia has suffered, and that Cordeliaâs mother isnât the woman she pretends to be, she becomes determined to save everyone she cares for before itâs too late. </p>

<h2 id="CvQpeQ"><strong>Full Speed to a Crash Landing by Beth Revis </strong></h2>
<h3 id="0noMnU"><strong>August 6</strong></h3>
<p id="a4DHlE">Having dabbled in the literary side of Star Wars for some time, Beth Revis is no stranger to science fiction, outer space, impossible heists, or romantic tension. Her new novella, <em>Full Speed to a Crash Landing</em> (the first in a trilogy) has all that going for it and more. </p>
<p id="rK7gzg">When readers first meet Ada Lamarr, sheâs running out of time. And oxygen. But help soon arrives in the form of a government sanctioned salvage crew. Theyâre less than thrilled to have her on board as they head to their destination, a secret mission helmed by the delightfully handsome Agent Rian White, but Ada promises to stay out of their hair and out of their business. This, of course, is a lie. But as Ada and Rian spend more time together and their attraction to one another continues to grow, it becomes increasingly unclear who is playing who. </p>

<p id="KcgSbo">If youâre in the mood to read a dynamic and brutal horror novel that will have you on the edge of your seat from cover-to-cover, look no further than <em>A Mask of Flies</em> by Matthew Lyons. </p>
<p id="9W6Iwl">After a bank heist goes horribly awry, Anne Heller is forced to hole up in her familyâs old cabin with Jessup, her badly wounded partner-in-crime, and Dutch, the police officer theyâve taken hostage. Jessup, unfortunately, doesnât make it. Anne and Dutch decide to bury his body, only for something that is-but-isnât Jessup to rise from his grave and try to get back into the cabin. </p>

<h2 id="yGqiu3"><strong>Lady Macbeth by Ava Reid </strong></h2>
<h3 id="xREXYM"><strong>August 13</strong></h3>
<p id="3v9xl7">When it comes to complicated, multi-faceted female characters, Ava Reid reigns supreme, and her upcoming novel, <em>Lady Macbeth</em>, reimagines the story of one of Shakespeareâs most ruthless, unforgiving, power-hungry women. </p>
<p id="P4Ym6T">The Lady knows what her fate holds in store for her. She knows that she is destined to marry a brutish Scot and to drive men to madness. The Lady also knows that sometimes it takes a little witchcraft to get by. What she doesnât know is that her husband has secrets of his own, including his own ties to the occult. </p>

<h2 id="YVL0mD"><strong>Blackheart Man by Nalo Hopkinson</strong></h2>
<h3 id="iEvBBT"><strong>August 20</strong></h3>
<p id="laJorf">Inspired by Caribbean culture, folklore, and history that deftly blurs the lines between reality and fiction, <em>Blackheart Man</em> by Nalo Hopkinson is a gripping tale of a magical island and the man who will do whatever he can to protect it.</p>
<p id="3kI6Il">Veycosi, a scholar on the island of Cynchin, wants nothing more in the world than the chance to get his hands on the Alamat Book of Light, a tome that contains  knowledge that would ensure his place on his islandâs Colloquium. His plans go abruptly sideways when fifteen galleons from a neighboring land arrive, forcing the island and its inhabitants into a trade agreement that proves to be much more dangerous than anticipated.</p>

<h2 id="TCvaXN"><strong>Voyage of the Damned by Frances White </strong></h2>
<h3 id="BFB7dH"><strong>August 20</strong></h3>
<p id="a8jeH0">Now being published in North America for the first time, <em>Voyage of the Damned</em> by Frances White has a little bit of everything. Part <em>And Then There Were None</em>, part fantasy novel, queer as hell, and surprisingly, delightfully romantic, itâs sure to scratch the <em>Pirates of the Caribbean </em>and <em>Our Flag Means Death</em> itch for a lot of readers. </p>
<p id="E4aU1O">The land of Concordia has maintained peace throughout its many provinces for thousands of years. Itâs an incredible feat, and to celebrate, the emperor is sending the twelve heirs of the provinces of Concordia, including Ganymedes Piscero (a notorious screw up and general disappointment to his family) on a twelve-day trip. When one of the other heirs turns up dead, Gamymedes knows his only choice is to find out who killed them before he ends up dead as well. </p>

<h2 id="SLV3Sm"><strong>Confounding Oaths by Alexis Hall </strong></h2>
<h3 id="vAgEW3"><strong>August 27</strong></h3>
<p id="YrVWkU">Alexis Hall, author of <em>Boyfriend Material</em>, has done it again! <em>Confounding Oaths</em> is a heartwarming regency romance that will be the perfect book to read while sitting on a beach or by the pool in the late August sun. </p>
<p id="n0zsi7">The year is 1815 and John Caesar is determined to host an incredible coming-out for his younger sister, Mary. Despite his best efforts, John is thwarted in just about every way imaginable; ragtag soldiers, a military cult, and a fairy godmother with ill intention all stand in his way. When Mary is cursed by fairy folk, John is forced to enlist the dashing, handsome, and unfortunately working class Captain James to rescue her. </p>

Hell, itâs almost physically impossible to type âWorldle.â Try it, your fingers will tie themselves in a knot.

<p>During its PlayStation State of Play on May 30, Sony confirmed that God of War Ragnarok and Until Dawn will <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/god-of-war-ragnarok-is-coming-to-pc-in-september/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">launch on PC later</a> this year. While thatâs good news for those waiting to check out the games for the first time, Sony <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2172010/Until_Dawn/">has confirmed that</a> both <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2322010/God_of_War_Ragnark/">games require</a> a PSN account to play.</p>



<p>With the requirement of a PSN account, Sony cuts out several regions that have access to Steam for their PC gaming but canât create a PSN account. </p>



<p>The topic of needing a PSN account to play games on Steam has been a hot debate for some time but picked up steam (no pun intended) when Sony tried to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/helldivers-2-now-requires-a-psn-account-to-play-on-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">enforce the requirement</a> on Helldivers 2 players months after the gameâs release. That decision, which was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/helldivers-2-account-linking/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ultimately reversed</a>, wouldâve taken the game away from dozens of regions and, likely, thousands of players.</p>



<p>While itâs not unheard of for companies like Sony and Xbox to require accounts from their ecosystem to play their games on PC, it draws confusion from players. Thatâs especially true when games are single-player-only titles such as Until Dawn and God of War Ragnarok.</p>







<p>For comparison, Ghost of Tsushima: Directorâs Cut, which launched on PC on May 16, doesnât require a PSN account to play the single-player mode. Itâs only needed if you want to play the gameâs Legends multiplayer mode.</p>



<hr>



<p>What do you think of needing a PSN account to play God of War Ragnarok and Until Dawn on PC? What about the idea of needing console accounts, in general, to play certain games on PC?</p>

                <p>Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick has commented on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/grand-theft-auto-6-everything-we-know/1100-6503729/" data-ref-id="1100-6503729">GTA 6</a> developer Rockstar Games' decision to not announce the game for PC. Currently, GTA 6 is scheduled to launch for PS5 and Xbox Series X|S in Fall 2025, and Zelnick was asked during a recent conference if an announcement regarding a PC launch would be made in the future.</p><p>"Well, the lack of an announcement is not something that could be set in stone as near as I could tell, because the only thing that happens after the lack of an announcement is an announcement, I suppose, or a continuing lack of an announcement, I guess that could happen too. It doesnât seem to me that either would be set in stone," Zelnick said at the TD Cowen conference this week (via <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/take-two-discusses-decision-not-to-announce-grand-theft-auto-6-for-pc/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">VGC</a>). "But Rockstar has an approach to platforms which we've seen before, and they will make more announcements in due time."</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Grand Theft Auto 6 (GTA VI) Trailer Breakdown</p>
      </div>
<p>Historically, Rockstar has launched several of its games on console first before eventually bringing them to PC. There have been some exceptions to the rule--like Red Dead Redemption--but games like GTA 4, GTA 5, and Red Dead Redemption 2 all eventually made their way onto PC over time. Zelnick also recently spoke about the possibility of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/with-gta-6-release-coming-up-take-two-boss-talks-about-setting-game-prices/1100-6523568/" data-ref-id="1100-6523568">Take-Two charging more than $70 for GTA 6</a> when it launches, commenting that Take-Two is aiming to overdeliver on the value of the game.</p><p>Zelnick added that Take-Two is still confident of a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-boss-highly-confident-in-fall-2025-release-window/1100-6523562/" data-ref-id="1100-6523562">Fall 2025 launch for GTA 6</a>, but he added that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-release-date-probably-doesnt-matter-anticipation-reaches-fever-pitch-take-two/1100-6523548/" data-ref-id="1100-6523548">GTA VI will likely be a success</a> whenever it releases due to the massive fan hype already behind it.</p><p>As for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/former-rockstar-dev-explains-why-gta-6-pc-port-isnt-coming-at-launch/1100-6519893/">why GTA 6 won't be available on PC at launch</a>, a former Rockstar developer said it simply comes down to a matter of priority at the studio. However, history suggests that Rockstar may eventually bring GTA 6 to PC, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-platforms-dont-include-pc-so-far-but-history-suggests-launch-coming-later/1100-6519704/">although it could be a long wait</a> for people hoping to play the game on that platform specifically.</p>

For the uninitiated. Marvel Rivals is a superhero (specifically Marvel superhero) team-based PVP shooter inspired by games like Overwatch. The footage, seen below, reveals Venom and Adam Warlock are coming to the game. The footage also shows a new location â the Tokyo 2099: Spider-Islands map.</p>

<p>Alongside the new gameplay details, the game is now also confirmed to be coming to PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S alongside the previously confirmed PC platform. Developer NetEase is also planning a closed beta for the game in July. PlayStation beta testers will have exclusive access to Spider-Man's Scarlet Spider cosmetic skin.</p>

<p>As first spotted by Twitter/X user <a href="https://x.com/Tyler_McV/status/1796528675745042495" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">@Tyler_McV</a>, Valve Corporation has now filed to trademark Deadlock <a href="https://tsdr.uspto.gov/#caseNumber=98576335&amp;caseSearchType=US_APPLICATION&amp;caseType=DEFAULT&amp;searchType=statusSearch" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">via USPTO</a>.</p>



<p>According to the USPTO status page, Valve only just filed for the Deadlock trademark on May 30, 2024. It is now live and pending, awaiting examination, which finally marks another step forward for the game.</p>



<p>It may give curious fans a better idea of the potential release window. Insider Gaming has supported a possible release for Deadlock is 2025. </p>



<p>All of the leaked footage online may also hint at the current state of Deadlockâs development. There has been a surprising volume of growing leaks, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/deadlock-leaks-valve-not-addressed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">including over 100</a> in recent weeks. </p>



<p>Insider Gaming also reported <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/new-details-on-valves-new-game-deadlock/">on new rumors</a> and provided exclusive details on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/exclusive-all-characters-in-valves-deadlock/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">all of the characters</a> coming to Deadlock. The characters will include magicians, robots, creatures, humans, and more. </p>



<p>Leaks suggest that Deadlock will be a hero-based, third-person shooter featuring 6v6 matches. There have also been comparisons to DOTAâs gameplay loop. Fortunately, further news may be coming soon, following the trademark.</p>



<p>It would make sense for Valve to reveal more after so much of the game has recently leaked online. Just last week, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/more-deadlock-gameplay-appears-online/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">brand-new gameplay videos</a> surfaced, revealing quite a lot. Deadlock appears to be in its Alpha testing stage. It was previously known as Neon Prime.</p>



<p>At this time, Valve has not officially announced anything about Deadlock or its trademark.</p>

<p>As one of the most important games ever released, Grand Theft Auto San Andreas had a soundtrack fit for the title of the greatest game of all time. Such a title is reserved for a few games in the history of all consoles; itâs also objective and can cause a flurry of emotional opinions at the mere suggestion that another game should deserve this moniker over your favorite title.</p>



<p>In any event, even if youâre not a fan of Grand Theft Auto games, you canât deny the huge cultural impact that each game has had from GTA 3 onwards. Part of this immense appeal has been because of the number of iconic songs that have appeared in the games over the years.</p>



<p>Back in 2004, San Andreas was by far the most ambitious that Rockstar had ever undertaken. It boasted three islands, including Las Venturas, where you could play a whole casino floor of games, which was a huge leap from Vice City. In San Andreas, you can play at a number of roulette tables across several different casinos on the Venturas Strip. Rockstar expanded this idea to incorporate the style of <a href="https://www.slots.lv/casino/table-games/roulette" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">roulette</a> games you see online today, with their GTA V model their most successful and ambitious yet.</p>



<p>A lot of the casino music in San Andreas is synonymous with the game. While James Brown was a tough omission from todayâs list, the saxophone from his iconic track is something many of us attach to those roulette games on those old, nostalgic casino floors of San Andreas.</p>



<p>San Andreas was seen as a monster of an upgrade from Vice City, which was a phenomenal game in itself. A big part of this was the extensive catalog of radio stations and songs â more than double that of its predecessor, Vice City. You could easily make a top 15 or 20 GTA song, but weâve been tasked with the unenviable task of boiling it down to the top five.</p>



<h2 id="h-5-ice-cube-it-was-a-good-day">5 â Ice Cube â It Was A Good Day</h2>



<p>Cruising around Los Santos in the low-rider golden days. Few songs could match the summer vibe of Los Santos like Ice Cubeâs classic song. It was a staple of Radio Los Santos and those early Grove Street missions. The famous sample is one of the most iconic in the history of rap â and it remains a song that is synonymous with the era, rap music, and the G-funk era that defined the West Coast in the early 1990s.</p>



<h2 id="h-4-rage-against-the-machine-killing-in-the-name">4 â Rage Against The Machine â Killing In The Name</h2>



<p>As one of the biggest bands of the early 1990s and hailing from the West Coast of the US, Rage was an almost guaranteed inclusion in the San Andreas soundtrack. Their song gained traction again just a few years after the release of San Andreas when they got to <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/news/rage-against-the-machine-take-christmas-no-1-slot-1846247.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Christmas number one in the UK</a>.</p>



<p>Itâs such a huge part of the game that its omission of the <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2021/nov/17/grand-theft-auto-the-trilogy-the-definitive-edition-review-an-infuriating-disappointment" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">widely criticized re-releases</a> was noticeable and attracted negative attention on social media. It doesnât take away from the fact that Rage was such a big part of the game and introduced a new legion of fans to their music via this landmark Rockstar classic.</p>



<h2 id="h-3-dr-dre-amp-snoop-dogg-nuthin-but-a-g-thang">3 â Dr Dre &amp; Snoop Dogg â Nuthinâ But A âGâ Thang</h2>



<p>Everything we said about Ice Cube applies to Nuthinâ But A G Thang â from the immortal Dre album The Chronic â for some, this is the quintessential San Andreas track. It exemplifies driving around Los Santos and many of those early missions when we were first getting to explore what the most anticipated game ever released had in store for us.</p>



<h2 id="h-2-lynyrd-skynyrd-free-bird">2 â Lynyrd Skynyrd â Free Bird</h2>



<p>Weâre not sure about you â but if you were cruising over Mount Chiliad in a private jet, Free Bird seemed to be the song that would crop up often. Many consider Free Bird to be the greatest ever Lynyrd Skynyrd track, and itâs definitely their most recognizable. Free Bird introduced a whole new wave of fans to the iconic rock band â and itâs definitely one of the most nostalgic for those of us who still have fond memories of playing San Andreas all those years ago.</p>



<h2 id="h-1-guns-n-roses-welcome-to-the-jungle">1 â Guns N Roses â Welcome To The Jungle</h2>



<p>Weâve put Welcome To The Jungle at number one because it was a song in the first-ever TV trailer. For those of you who can still cast your minds back that far, the excitement was truly palpable. The trailer focused on all of the new advancements: the Venturas strip, private jets, bicycles, helicopters, parachutes, and a whole raft of other innovations.</p>



<p>This Guns N Roses classic is one that many of us still attached to the main protagonist, CJ â who we rank as the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gta-protagonists-ranked/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">number 2 GTA protagonist of all time</a>. While there might be more iconic individual GTA songs â Welcome To The Jungle perfectly encapsulated the game, and the era the game was set. Simpler times for many of us, Iâm sure!</p>

<p>When Grand Theft Auto (GTA) 6 was revealed in December, players immediately noticed that the game was only announced for Xbox Series X|S and PlayStation 5. The lack of a PC release at launch frustrated many who will have waited 12 years since the gameâs initial launch on PS3 and Xbox 360 in 2013 by the time GTA 6 releases. Rockstar owner Take-Two Interactive is now addressing the decision not to announce GTA 6 for PC.</p>



<p>During a talk at the <a href="https://wsw.com/webcast/cowen162/ttwo/2064582">TD Cowen conference</a> on May 30, Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick was asked about the lack of a PC announcement for the game (around the six-minute mark), and whether that was a firm decision.</p>



<p>âWell, the lack of an announcement is not something that could be set in stone as near as I could tell, because the only thing that happens after the lack of an announcement is an announcement, I suppose, or a continuing lack of an announcement, I guess that could happen too. It doesnât seem to me that either would be set in stone,â he told those on the conference call.â</p>



<p>He continued: âBut Rockstar has an approach to platforms which weâve seen before, and they will make more announcements in due time. I do believe that the right strategy for our business is to be where the consumer is, and historically what this company has done is address consumers anywhere they are, on any platform that makes sense, over time.â</p>



<p>There wasnât a follow-up on the topic as the conference call moved forward with other business questions for Zelnick. That said, his comments surely opened the door to hope that GTA 6 will be released on PC. However, how close to the initial release remains to be seen. GTA 5 didnât come to PC until nearly two years after its initial release. The studioâs most recent release, Red Dead Redemption 2, wasnât released on PC until a year after its console release.</p>



<p>GTA 6 is set to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gta-6-releasing-fall-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">release in Fall 2025</a>.</p>
