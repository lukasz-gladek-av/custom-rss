			<p>Today, Creative Assembly made the announcement that Total War: WARHAMMER III's newest DLC will be launching on December 12. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1142710/Total_War_WARHAMMER_III/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">This DLC is named Omens of Destruction</a> and will include a ton of new content for players to get stuck into. This includes faction expansions, a new Legendary Lord, and much more. Now, let's dive into the nitty gritty about what you can expect from Total War: WARHAMMER III's DLC, Omens of Destruction.</p>
<p>Omens of Destruction focuses on expanding the factions of Khorne, Greenskins, and Ogre Kingdoms by adding new lords, heroes, and units. In addition, there will be new gameplay mechanics for players to utilize and master in Immortal Empires.</p>
<p>In addition to this content, as part of Patch 6.0 of Total War: WARHAMMER III, the 100th Legendary Lord will be added to the game as free content. This Legendary Lord is Arbaal the Undefeated, the champion of Khorne. As part of the patch, players will also see a faction update arrive in the game for the Ogre Kingdoms, Khorne, and Orcs &amp; Goblins.</p>
<p><iframe title="Total War: WARHAMMER III - Omens of Destruction Announce Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/83chO9NuWAg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Moving on to the paid DLC content, there are three significant updates to the factions being added. First is Skulltaker, the Hero Slayer, Khorne's immortal champion and the best of all Bloodletters. With the addition of Skulltaker comes a Cloak of Skulls, which is a campaign feature. Skulltaker is tasked with seeking out enemy lords and defeating them. They excel in dueling and hunting. Along with Khorne's new champion, there will be new units to experiment with. This includes two legendary heroes named Skarr Bloodwrath and Skyla Anfingrimm.</p>
<p>Moving on to the Orcs &amp; Goblins, players will get to play as Gorbad Ironclaw, the Brutal Unifier. He is one of the most infamous of all Orc Warbosses. The campaign feature for Gorbad is named Da' Plan, where you have to experiment and try to utilize unique battle tactics for your armies. Compared to Skulltaker, his playstyle is rather different. He rides into battle on his Warboar named Gnarla. He is able to close the gap between him and his enemies by charging in and using his hefty axe in close combat.&nbsp; There are new units, including the legendary hero Sngla Grobspit, as well as warriors like the Savage Orc Great Shaman and Night Goblin Big Boss.</p>
<p>Finally, there is the Golgfag Maneater, the Mercenary. They are one of the most successful Ogre mercenaries of all time. In their campaign feature, you have to take on mercenary contracts where you help out your clients across the expansive Warhammer World to help settle their disputes with enemies. When Golgfag is in battle, he uses a wide variety of barbaric weaponry to secure the kills. Of course, there are also new units for the Ogres, which includes the Legendary Hero Bragg the Gutsman, as well as the Ogre Paymaster and Bruiser.</p>
<p>This is just the tip of the expansive iceberg, and there are plenty more units for you to explore and utilize on <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/total-war-warhammer-iii-glory-bear-god/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the battlefield</a> in Total War: WARHAMMER III's upcoming DLC. You don't have long to wait, as it's set to release on December 12. Make sure to check out the trailer above to see some of the content in action.</p>

<p>On Tuesday, Sony launched its 30th Anniversary website for PlayStation. The <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/playstation-history/2000-ps2-psp/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">website goes through</a> the console’s history from the original PlayStation through the current PlayStation 5 (PS5). It also gave confirmation of an updated number on the best-selling video game console of all time, the PlayStation 2 (PS2).</p>



<p>According to Sony, the PS2 has sold over 160 million units  since its launch in 2000. Prior to this update, the last known sales total for the console was 158.3 million units.</p>



<h6 id="h-help-insider-gaming-take-our-2024-reader-survey">HELP INSIDER GAMING:&nbsp;<a href="https://forms.gle/wvT7oBtvjZLVmrEv9" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Take Our 2024 Reader Survey</a></h6>



<p>The sales include original versions of the console as well us various models, including the PS2 Slim that launched in 2004.</p>



<p>At 160 million units, the PS2 widens its gap as the best-selling console ever. Behind it in the home console space is the Nintendo Switch, which as sold 146 million units. If we were to add handheld systems to the total, the PS2 sits just just six million ahead of the 154.02 million units the Nintendo DS sold in its life cycle.</p>



<p>What made the system so popular were not only the games, but the console’s ability to play DVDs as well. An all-in-one system during a time when DVDs became the norm for movie and TV show purchases made for an enticing buy for players. Obviously, the move paid off. </p>



<p>As far as the current Sony console, the PS5, Sony says that it has sold over 65 million units in its four years on the market.</p>

<p>Like a lot of children of the '80s, my early gaming nostalgia has a huge hole where the Atari 7800 might have lived. While <a href="https://www.escapistmagazine.com/retro-colored-glasses/">practically everyone I knew had an NES</a> during my childhood—and a few uncles and friends' older siblings even had an Atari 2600 gathering dust in their dens—I was only vaguely aware of the 7800, Atari's backward compatible, late '80s attempt to maintain relevance in the quickly changing console market.</p>
<p>Absent that kind of nostalgia, the Atari 7800+ comes across as a real oddity. Fiddling with the system's extremely cumbersome controllers and pixelated, arcade-port-heavy software library from a modern perspective is like peering into a fallen alternate universe, one where Nintendo wasn't able to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/10/war-stories-how-nintendo-sold-the-nes-to-a-skeptical-country/">swoop in and revive a flailing Western home video game industry</a> with the NES.</p>
<p>Even for those with fond memories of Atari 7800-filled childhoods, I'm not sure that this bare-bones package justifies its $130 price. There are many more full-featured ways to get your retro gaming fix, even for those still invested in the tail end of Atari's dead-end branch of the gaming console's evolutionary tree.</p>
<h2>7800HD</h2>
<p>Much like <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/11/review-new-atari-2600-doesnt-justify-its-plus-sign/">last year's Atari 2600+</a>, the 7800+ shell is a slightly slimmed-down version of Atari's nostalgic hardware design. This time, Atari took design inspiration from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Atari_7800_games#/media/File:Atari-7800-wControl-Pad-L.jpg">the rainbow-adorned European version of the 7800 console</a> (which released a year later), rather than <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Atari_7800_games#/media/File:Atari-7800-Console-Set.jpg">the bulkier, less colorful US release</a>.</p>

<p>The 7800+ plays any of the 58 officially licensed Atari 7800 cartridges released decades ago, as well as <a href="https://forums.atariage.com/topic/359092-atari-7800-homebrew-games-releasedcompletedwip-in-2024/">the dozens of homebrew cartridges</a> released by coders in more recent years (some of which are now being sold for $30 each by the modern Atari corporation itself; more on those later). The data on those cartridges is run via <a href="https://gstanton.github.io/ProSystem1_3/">the open source ProSystem emulator</a>, which seems more than up to the job of re-creating the relatively ancient 7800 tech without any apparent slowdown, input lag, or graphical inconsistencies. The 15 to 30 seconds of loading time when you first plug in a new cartridge is more than a bit annoying, though.</p>

          
                      
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>The HDMI output from the 7800+ is the updated console's main selling point, if anything is. The sharp, upscaled images work best on games with lots of horizontal and/or vertical lines and bright, single-colored sprites. But blowing up decades-old low-resolution graphics can also hurt the visual appeal of games designed to take advantage of the smoother edges and blended color gradients inherent to older cathode ray tube TVs.</p>
<p>Atari's new console doesn't offer the kind of scanline emulation or graphical filters that can help recreate that CRT glow in countless other emulation solutions (though a hardware switch does let you extend the standard 4:3 graphics to a sickeningly stretched-out 16:9). That means many of the sprites in games like <em>Food Fight</em> and <em>Fatal Run</em> end up looking like blocky riots of color when blown up to HD resolutions on the 7800+.</p>
<p>Beyond graphics, the 7800+ also doesn't offer any modern emulation conveniences like save states, fast-forward and rewind, slow-mo, controller customization, or high-score tracking across sessions. Authenticity seems to have taken precedence over modern conveniences here.</p>
<p>Much like the original Atari 7800, the 7800+ is also backward-compatible with older Atari 2600 cartridges and controllers (re-created through the able <a href="https://stella-emu.github.io/">Stella emulator</a>). That's a nice touch but also a little galling for anyone who already invested money in last year's Atari 2600+, which the company is <a href="https://atari.com/products/atari-2600-plus">still selling</a> for roughly the same price as&nbsp;the 7800+. Aside from the nostalgic styling of the box itself, we can't see any reason why the less-capable 2600+ still needs to exist at all at this point.</p>
<h2>A mess of a controller</h2>
<p>In the US, the original Atari 7800 came with <a href="https://nfgworld.com/atari-7800-proline-controller-review/">an oddly designed "ProLine" joystick</a> featuring two buttons on either side of the base, designed to be hit with the thumb and index finger of your off hand. For the 7800+, Atari instead went with a controller modeled after the CX78 joypad released with the European version of the console.</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>This pad represents an odd inflection point in video game history, with a hard plastic thumbstick sticking out above a standard eight-way D-pad. Years before analog thumbsticks would become a console standard, this thumbstick feels incredibly fiddly for the console's completely digital directional inputs. In a game like <em>Asteroid Deluxe</em>, for instance, I found turning to the right or left frequently led to thrusting forward with an accidental "up" push as well.</p>


<p>The CX78 pad was also the first packaged Atari controller with two face buttons, a la the familiar NES controller. Unfortunately, those buttons are spaced just far enough apart to make it extremely awkward to hit both at once using a single thumb, which is practically required in newer titles like <em>Bentley Bear’s Crystal Quest</em>. The whole thing seems designed for placing the controller in front of you and hitting the buttons with two separate fingers, which I found less than convenient.</p>
<p>The Atari 7800+ does feature two standard Atari console plugs in the front, making it compatible with pretty much all classic and revamped Atari controllers (and, oddly enough, Sega Genesis pads). Be wary, though; if a 7800 game requires two buttons, a lot of single-button Atari control options will prove insufficient.</p>
<p>The CX78+'s included wireless receivers (which plug into those controller ports) mean you don't have to run any long cables from the system to your couch while playing the Atari 7800+. But a few important controls like pause and reset are stuck on the console itself—just as they were on the original Atari 7800—meaning you'll probably want to have the system nearby anyway. It would have been nice to have additional buttons for these options on the controller itself, even if that would have diminished the authenticity of the controllers.</p>

<p>Since I've never owned an Atari 7800 cartridge, Atari sent me eight titles from <a href="https://atari.com/collections/physical-cartridges?srsltid=AfmBOorngOOExe1LBDCSw3h34Zn0aefTqRMjv9ZBhi9kTKh8p8N8u33B">its current line of retro cartridges</a> to test alongside the updated hardware. This included a mix of original titles released in the '80s and "homebrew elevation" cartridges that the company says are now "getting a well-deserved official Atari release."</p>
<p>The titles I had to test were definitely a step up from the few dozen Atari 2600 games that I've accumulated and <a href="https://www.escapistmagazine.com/retro-colored-glasses/">grown to tolerate</a> over the years. A game like <em>Asteroids Deluxe</em> on the 7800 doesn't quite match the vector graphics of the arcade original, but it comes a lot closer than the odd, colorful blobs of <em>Asteroids</em> on the 2600. The same goes for <em>Frenzy</em> on the 7800, which is a big step up from <em>Berzerk</em> on the 2600.</p>
<p>Still, I couldn't help but feel that these arcade ports are better experienced these days on one of the many <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/05/mame-for-the-masses-legends-arcade-cabinet-could-thread-that-needle/">MAME-based</a> or <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/01/flurry-of-firmware-updates-makes-analogue-pocket-an-even-better-retro-handheld/">FPGA-based emulation boxes</a> that can do justice to the original quarter munchers. And the more original titles I've sampled mostly ended up feeling like pale shadows of the NES games I knew and loved.</p>
<p>The new <em>Bentley Bear’s Crystal Quest</em> (which is included with the 7800+ package) comes across as an oversimplified knock-off of <em>Adventure Island</em>, for instance. And the rough vehicular combat of <em>Fatal Run</em> is much less engaging than the NES port of Atari's own similar but superior <em>Roadblasters</em> arcade cabinet. The one exception to this rule that I found was <em>Ninja Golf</em>, a wacky, original mix of decent golfing and engaging run-and-punch combat.</p>
<p>Of course, I'm not really the target audience here. The ideal Atari 7800+ buyer is someone who still has nostalgic memories of the Atari 7800 games they played as a child and has held onto at least a few of them (and/or bought more modern homebrew cartridges) in the intervening decades.</p>
<p>If those retro gamers want an authentic but no-frills box that will upscale those cartridges for an HDTV, the Atari 7800+ will do the job and look cute on your mantel while it does. But any number of emulation solutions will probably do the job just as well and with more features to boot.</p>

                <p>Activision continues to stock the Call of Duty in-game store with new bundles, and the latest lets you become a legally distinct version of Guardians of the Galaxy's Rocket Raccoon. Or at least that's what people are saying about the new "Cash Bandit" store bundle that went live today, November 26, for Black Ops 6 and Warzone.</p><p>The bundle comes with the "Raccoon Goon" skin for Niran, along with the "Debt Collector" weapon skin for the Sirin 9mm special weapon that was recently released. There is also a "Vault Security" GPR 91 assault rifle blueprint included with the bundle.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4405962-crashbandit.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4405962" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4405962-crashbandit.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4405962"></a><figcaption>This is not Rocket Raccoon.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4405962-crashbandit.jpg"></figure><p>The raccoon skin also includes a weapon reticle called "Cash Flow," along with a finishing move labeled "Disarmed." What's more, the bundle includes a raccoon-themed decal and weapon charm, as well as a one-hour double XP token. This DLC bundle costs 2,800 COD Points, which is about $20 USD.</p><p>This isn't the first Call of Duty store bundle that bears a resemblance to a Guardians of the Galaxy character. Activision previously released the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-brings-back-evil-groot-skin-with-this-big-change/1100-6520390/" data-ref-id="1100-6520390">Gaia skin for 2023's Modern Warfare III that looked a lot like Groot </a>from the Marvel superhero franchise.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I-3WAwZIbIY" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/I-3WAwZIbIY" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>If you don't want to become a raccoon but want to play Call of Duty as an animal, the in-game store was also recently stocked with a bundle that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-now-lets-you-become-a-muscly-shark/1100-6528027/" data-ref-id="1100-6528027">turns you into a shark with huge muscles.</a></p><p>Black Ops 6 launched at the end of October and was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/new-releases-dominate-the-20-best-selling-games-for-october-in-the-us/2900-5979/#1" data-ref-id="2900-5979">the month's best-selling game in the US</a>, and is already the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/2024s-best-selling-games-in-the-us/2900-5106/#1" data-ref-id="2900-5106">No. 3 best-selling game of 2024 so far.</a></p><p>In other Call of Duty news, it's been reported that Microsoft has <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-dutys-future-design-plans-emerge-in-leaked-information/1100-6527996/" data-ref-id="1100-6527996">created a new committee to help shape the future of the mega-franchise</a>, while the first supposed information about <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sledgehammer-games-reportedly-leading-development-on-2027s-call-of-duty/1100-6528047/" data-ref-id="1100-6528047">2027's Call of Duty game</a> has emerged.</p>

This is more than just a brand-new map for Zombies in Black Ops 6, as Citadelle des Morts represents a key development in the ongoing Zombies narrative, as it merges some of the existing Treyarch storylines that had previously been unconnected. Here's what you need to know before the map arrives on December 5.</p><p dir="ltr">The final storyline cutscene for the Terminus map throws a bunch of names at you, and if you haven't played Black Ops 4 or Vanguard Zombies, these mentions may not mean anything to you, but for longtime fans this connects all of the stories in an intriguing way.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Call Of Duty: Black Ops 6 - Citadelle des Morts Zombies Cinematic Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Some spoilers ahead:</strong> The final Terminus cinematics reveals that Edward Richtofen has been seeking Prima Materia and the Sentinel Artifacts, which are the main elements of Treyarch's Chaos storyline.</p><p dir="ltr">In 2018, Call of Duty: Black Ops 4 introduced a completely new set of Zombies characters for the Chaos storyline, which, until now, has been unconnected to the Aether storyline that involves the original Zombies cast of Edward Richtofen, Takeo Masaki, Tank Dempsey, and Nikolai Belinsk. Black Ops 4's cast of Chaos characters chased down Sentinel Artifacts, which were relics created by an Earth-mined substance known as Prima Materia.</p><p dir="ltr">In Black Ops 4, Prima Materia is revealed as a substance that brought so much power that it corrupted and destroyed whole civilizations. It's no shock that Richtofen is seeking this kind of power, but it could have a catastrophic outcome if he gains possession of a Sentinel Artifact. It's also revealed that a Sentinel Artifact might be able to harness the power needed to bring back Samantha Maxis from the Dark Aether. Samantha Maxis sacrificed herself in the final cutscene for Black Ops Cold War Zombies in order to seal the Dark Aether breach and stop the Zombies boss called the Forsaken.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4405957-19369f6ed7213-screenshoturl.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4405957" data-ratio="0.56261682242991" data-width="2140" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4405957-19369f6ed7213-screenshoturl.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4405957"></a><figcaption>The Terminus cutscene's mention of a Sentinel Artifact</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4405957-19369f6ed7213-screenshoturl.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Additionally, the Terminus cutscene also tells us that Richtofen hired a French syndicate to help him find a Sentinel Artifact. This syndicate is led by Franco Moreau, and he has employed the help of Sergei Ravenov, who has abducted a man named Gabriel Krafft to interrogate for knowledge on the artifacts.</p><p dir="ltr">This part of the cutscene drops some interesting names, yet it's also a little confusing. Chronologically, Sergei Ravenov was last seen helping members of the Terminus crew stop the Outbreak incursions in Black Ops Cold War. Gabriel Krafft, on the other hand, was a demonologist in Vanguard Zombies who studied these Sentinel Artifacts. He was shown as a very old man during the time of World War II, so it will be interesting to see how the story explains he is sill alive in 1991. <a href="https://x.com/Treyarch/status/1861441696099115196" rel="nofollow ">Treyarch even teases this</a> for the trailer reveal, referring to Krafft as "the man who should not be alive." Maybe Kraftt has resorted to using some kind of relic for himself.</p><p dir="ltr">The mystery of Kraftt's survival and the chase for a Sentinel Artifact makes Season 1 of Black Ops an exciting time to be a Zombies fan. We'll now be playing as the Terminus crew, who are headed to a castle in Europe to rescue Vanguard's Gabriel Krafft from a dangerous syndicate in order to help locate Black Ops 4's Sentinel Artifact before the powerful relic gets in the hands of Edward Richtofen. The Terminus crew not only wants to stop Richtofen, but now they're looking to use the power for themselves in order to bring Samantha Maxis back.</p><p dir="ltr">The first <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cod-black-ops-6-zombies-citadelle-des-morts-trailer-brings-back-a-familiar-face/1100-6528064/">cinematic trailer for Citadelle des Morts can be viewed here</a>, which shows the Terminus crew have now fled the prison island, and they've reconnected with Sergei Ravenov. They ask him to turn against the French syndicate, explaining to him that Krafft might know how to bring Samantha back.</p><p dir="ltr">We'll likely learn more story and map details closer to launch. In addition to Citadelle des Morts, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/cod-black-ops-6-and-warzone-season-1-roadmap-shows-mp-maps-7-new-weapons-and-castle-map-for-zombies/2900-5940/#1">the big Zombies update</a> will include Perk-a-Cola, a new field upgrade, a new ammo mod, and more Augments to unlock. The map's main story quest will also go live simultaneously with the launch.</p>

<p>Despite its initially rocky launch, developer Creative Assembly stuck with Total War: Warhammer 3 since day one, unleashing bug fixes, quality-of-life improvements, and brand-new content in the form of expansions and faction packs to expand upon the game’s core armies significantly. Well, the game’s about to grow larger. CA has announced the Omens of Destruction for Total War: Warhammer 3, featuring three new playable Legendary Lords, one each for Khorne, Ogre Kingdoms, and the Orcs.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Total War: WARHAMMER III - Omens of Destruction Announce Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/83chO9NuWAg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>The three new Legendary Lords include:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Gorbad </strong>– Orcs</li>



<li><strong>Golgfag </strong>– Ogre Kingdoms</li>



<li><strong>Skulltaker </strong>– Khorne</li>
</ul>



<p>The three new pieces of DLC will launch simultaneously on December 12. While the price tag is currently unknown, going by past Legendary Lord DLC, we suspect each pack will cost $8.99 apiece. A bundle containing all three will be available for approximately $23, with a slight discount for packaging them together.</p>



<p>Alongside the new DLC, we’ll receive update 6.0 for Total War: Warhammer 3, and the 100th Legendary Lord, Arbaal the Undefeated, a champion of Khorne, utterly free as part of the update. </p>

                <p>Australia has built a reputation as having one of the strictest video game rating systems on the planet, and it appears as though another highly anticipated game won't reach the country's shores when it's released next year.</p><p>Hunter x Hunter Nen x Impact, the fighting game based on the popular anime, has been refused classification by the Australian Classification Board (ACB), officially preventing the game from being sold in the country. The group listed no reason for the decision, but with the ACB having set a precedent with other games with similar ratings, and the reasoning behind them, it could be a few possibilities.</p><p>The main suspected reason is how drug use has a gameplay benefit, like granting speed or strength, or portraying drug use in a positive light. For example, if a character even gets health restored from narcotics, that game would likely be refused classification (RC). Disco Elysium: The Final Cut was originally banned because of this, but that decision was later overturned after the ACB agreed that player performance actually showed "negative impacts from depictions of drug use."</p><p>Other potential reasons include on-screen depictions of sexual violence and sexualized depictions of characters who appear to be under 18. South Park: The Stick of Truth was banned for the same reasons as the game involves an underaged main character getting anally probed by aliens. A censored version was released replacing those scenes with a card of a koala crying explaining what has been cut out.</p><p>Hunter x Hunter Nen x Impact is being developed by Eighting, a close collaborator with Nintendo, having contributed to Pikmin 3 Deluxe, Pikmin 4, and Nintendo Switch Sports. The game is scheduled to be released on PS5, Nintendo Switch, and PC, but unless publisher Arc System Works decides to appeal, Australian fans will sadly miss out.</p>

                <p>Section 9 Interactive, a studio composed of former Tarsier Studios devs responsible for the first two<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/little-nightmares/"> Little</a><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/little-nightmares/" data-ref-id="5000-456964"> Nightmares</a> games, has announced today it's inked a deal with Epic Games Publishing to bring its upcoming game to PC and consoles. The game doesn't have an announced name yet, but by the looks of it, some of the Little Nightmares aesthetic will carry over into this debut project from the studio.</p><p>Despite the creepy enemies and shadowy atmosphere, the studio doesn't describe the game as horror. Instead, it considers it a "sci-fi action-adventure" game built in Unreal Engine 5. Still, some of the enemies shown in the game's work-in-progress assets like the one below have a certain "In space, no one can hear you scream" vibe about them. No release window has yet been revealed.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4405888-screenshot2024-11-26094334.png" data-ref-id="1300-4405888" data-ratio="0.56070287539936" data-width="626" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4405888-screenshot2024-11-26094334.png" data-ref-id="1300-4405888"></a><figcaption>I'm not sure what to call this thing, but instinctively, I know to run from it.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4405888-screenshot2024-11-26094334.png"></figure><p>For Epic, this signing follows its most high-profile work yet in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/alan-wake-ii/" data-ref-id="5000-547391">Alan Wake 2</a>, which launched last year on PC, Xbox Series X|S, and PS5 to universal acclaim.

Echoing what Remedy had said of its partner, Section 9 said Epic Publishing has "given us incredible support and the freedom to fully explore our creative vision, which is all we can ask for in a publisher."</p><p>Other ongoing Epic Publishing deals include the long-gestating next game from Playdead, the studio behind indie darlings <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/limbo/" data-ref-id="5000-70518">Limbo</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/inside/" data-ref-id="5000-285251">Inside</a>, as well as Fumito Ueda's studio GenDesign.

Tarsier, the series' original developer, is making <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/reanimal/" data-ref-id="5000-640431">Reanimal</a>, while Supermassive has been handed the reins to create the next sequel in the series, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/little-nightmares-iii/" data-ref-id="5000-599972">Little Nightmares 3</a>.</p>

While that opened up a world of possibilities for PC players, the core game has just received an incredible visual upgrade that may even surpass the title's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/the-witcher-3-wild-hunt-next-gen-update-review-winds-howlin/1900-6416135/" data-ref-id="1900-6416135">2022 next-gen update</a>.</p><p>A modder who goes by Halk Hogan released The Witcher 3 HD Reworked Project: Next Gen Edition, which claims to raise "the game's visuals to the highest level yet and enhance it to a truly next-gen masterpiece." To back up those remarks, Halk Hogan has posted a 15-minute side-by-side comparison on YouTube that shows off the improvements.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jD1mNA4Efcw" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/jD1mNA4Efcw" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>The Witcher 3 HD Reworked Project: Next Gen Edition is now available on <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/witcher3/mods/9963" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">NexusMods</a>. According to the description, "Everything is carefully made with attention to every detail. All this is aimed at making the game more detailed, realistic, consistent and as faithful as possible reflecting the atmosphere of the dirty world of the Witcher."</p><p>As part of an earnings report earlier this week, CD Projekt Red revealed that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-witcher-4-is-now-officially-in-production-new-teaser-image-revealed/1100-6528058/" data-ref-id="1100-6528058">The Witcher 4 is officially in production</a>, and the announcement came alongside an enigmatic teaser image. That game is probably still several years away from reaching players. In the meantime, Liam Hemsworth will be taking over the role of Geralt from Henry Cavill in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-witcher-season-4-liam-hemsworth-first-look-as-geralt-revealed-by-netflix/1100-6523641/" data-ref-id="1100-6523641">The Witcher Season 4</a> on Netflix.

Customization is the main reason. The Ultimate has two remappable back triggers and a dedicated app for PC, Mac, and mobile devices that lets you tweak various features. You can remap inputs, set up three custom profiles to cycle through on the fly, and adjust the sensitivity of the sticks, dual rumble motors, and triggers. You can also create dead zones and program macros.</p><p>And unlike the Switch Pro Controller, the 8BitDo Ultimate has Hall Effect analog sticks, which mitigates the risk of stick drift.</p><p>The Ultimate is a well-designed controller that feels great to hold. I think the Switch Pro Controller has slightly better ergonomics, so I personally switch back and forth between the two controllers. If I'm playing a game with a bunch of control inputs like Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom or Echoes of Wisdom, I like the convenience of the back buttons on the Ultimate.</p><p>The 8BitDo Ultimate Bluetooth comes with a matching charging dock with a compartment housing the 2.4GHz adapter. You can use the optional adapter on PC, Mac, or Steam Deck to play wirelessly on those platforms. You can also sync the controller to iPhone or Android via Bluetooth.</p></div>                      </div>                                                                     <div>             <h2>                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Ultimate-Wireless-Controller-Charging-Joystick-PC/dp/B0CX53MFVW?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Ultimate-Wireless-Controller-Charging-Joystick-PC\/dp\/B0CX53MFVW?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/Ultimate-Wireless-Controller-Charging-Joystick-PC/dp/B0CX53MFVW?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20">8BitDo Ultimate 2.4GHz Wireless Controller for PC</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Ultimate-Wireless-Controller-Charging-Joystick-PC/dp/B0CX53MFVW?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Ultimate-Wireless-Controller-Charging-Joystick-PC\/dp\/B0CX53MFVW?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/Ultimate-Wireless-Controller-Charging-Joystick-PC/dp/B0CX53MFVW?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20">$40 (was $50)</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <div><ul><li>Works with PC, Mac, Steam Deck</li><li>Available in white, black, and purple</li><li>Hall Effect analog sticks</li><li>Two remappable back triggers</li><li>Connects wirelessly with 2.4GHz dongle</li><li>Optional USB-C wired mode</li><li>Up to 15 hours battery life</li><li>Includes matching charging dock</li></ul><p><strong>Customize with 8BitDo Ultimate Software for PC/Mac:</strong></p><ul><li>Remap inputs</li><li>Set up three custom profiles</li><li>Set up dead zones</li><li>Adjust stick sensitivity</li><li>Adjust trigger sensitivity</li><li>Adjust rumble intensity</li><li>Create dead zones</li></ul><p>8BitDo's 2.4GHz-only model, which leads the way on our list of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/best-pc-controller/1100-6496530/" data-ref-id="1100-6496530">best PC controllers</a>, is also on sale for Black Friday 2024.

<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-witcher-4">The Witcher 4</a> - AKA Project Polaris AKA "the first instalment in the new Witcher saga", as it continues to be referred to in lieu of a publicly announced name - is another step closer to release, with CD Projekt confirming its development has shifted to "full-scale production".
</p>
<p>
"I'm proud to confirm that several weeks ago the Polaris team wrapped up preproduction and moved on to full-scale production – the most intensive phase of development," joint CEO Michał Nowakowski wrote in a <a href="https://www.cdprojekt.com/en/media/news/cd-projekt-wraps-up-the-third-quarter-of-2024/">statement accompanying its Q3 2024 earnings report</a>. "We are very pleased with our progress on this project, and I wish to thank the team for its dedication."
</p>
<p>
Nowakowski's update follows a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cd-projekt-says-the-witcher-4-will-enter-full-production-soon">progress report in August</a> anticipating Project Polaris' full production phase would start "soon", and CD Projekt's confirmation that milestone has now been reached was celebrated on social media by Polaris game director Sebastian Kalemba. "With new challenges just around the corner," he <a href="https://x.com/Skalemba/status/1861446070858846571">wrote</a>, "it's the talented and hard-working people who make me believe we can together make the upcoming Witcher Saga a remarkable experience. No stopping now! Stay tuned for what's on the other side of the coin!"

<p>
It has, of course, been a little over two and half years since CD Projekt <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cd-projekt-confirms-new-the-witcher-game-in-development">revealed</a> development on the next game in The Witcher series had begun, but the project still remains a bit of an enigma. About all we know so far, beyond whatever speculation can be eked out of the single bit of tantalising promo art shared alongside Polaris' announcement, is that it "won't focus" on Geralt of Rivia. That bit of news was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/geralt-voice-actor-confirms-he-will-be-part-of-the-witcher-4">shared by Geralt actor Doug Cockle earlier this year</a>, although he did at least confirm the character would be a "part of" the new game.
</p><p>
Alongside CD Projekt's Witcher news, the studio has provided updated sales figures for some of its older titles, confirming <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a> has now surpassed 30m copies sold. That's 5m more than the company had <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cyberpunk-2077-sales-top-25m-cd-projekt-red-announces">shifted last October</a>, with the well-recieved <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/cyberpunk-2077-phantom-liberty">Phantom Liberty</a> expansion also selling a further 5m copies in the same timeframe, bringing its total sales up to 8m. "These are impressive figures," Nowakowski added. "I'm very happy to see a large, dedicated community coalesce around our Cyberpunk games."
</p>
<p>Additionally, CD Projekt has reiterated, as per a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NpeetmZuc80">teaser in September</a>, it'll be following the success of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cyberpunk-edgerunners-shows-cd-projekts-cyberpunk-is-still-worth-fighting-for">2022's acclaimed Cyberpunk: Edgerunners</a> with a brand-new <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/netflix">Netflix</a> animated series set in the Cyberpunk 2077 universe, although no further information has been revealed.
</p>
<p>
CD Projekt previously announced Cyberpunk 2077 is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cd-projekt-is-bringing-cyberpunk-2077-to-macs-early-next-year">launching for Mac next year</a>, but one thing the game <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cd-projekt-says-no-plans-for-cyberpunk-2077-upgrade-patch-on-ps5-pro">won't be getting</a> is any kind of update for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/topics/ps5-pro">PS5 Pro</a>.

<p>Despite recent downfalls, like that of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-tests-avoid-concord/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Concord</a>, the free-to-play hero shooter genre continues performing relatively well for a select few titles. It’s hard for a newcomer to make a dent, but it appears Theorycraft Games’ Supervive, launched on November 20, outperforms much of its competition. But it leaves many questions open for fans on the sidelines. For instance, who are the Supervive hunters?</p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-supervive">What is Supervive?</h2>



<p>Supervive is a free-to-play hero shooter with battle royale and MOBA elements from developer Theorycraft Games. It’s a fast-paced, PvP-oriented experience that favors frantic gameplay in which players will dash and glide while unleashing attack combos to deal damage and complete objectives. Every hero in the game, known as a Hunter, is flexible and allows various abilities and equipment to alter playstyles and change up the match.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-are-hunters-in-supervive">What Are Hunters in Supervive?</h2>



<p>Hunters in Supervive are this game’s version of heroes. They’re playable characters, each of which fall into five categories:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Fighter</strong></li>



<li><strong>Initiator</strong></li>



<li><strong>Frontliner</strong></li>



<li><strong>Protector</strong></li>



<li><strong>Controller</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>Unlike your typical hero shooter, Supervive heavily leans into its MOBA roots to combine elements of the compelling lane-based gameplay in its PvP-focused free-to-play hero shooter.</p>







<h2 id="h-who-are-all-of-the-supervive-hunters-available">Who Are All of the Supervive Hunters Available?</h2>



<p>There are a total of sixteen playable characters in Supervive currently, including:</p>



<ol>
<li><strong>Brall</strong></li>



<li><strong>Bishop</strong></li>



<li><strong>Celeste</strong></li>



<li><strong>Elluna</strong></li>



<li><strong>Felix</strong></li>



<li><strong>Ghost</strong></li>



<li><strong>Hudson</strong></li>



<li><strong>Jin</strong></li>



<li><strong>Joule</strong></li>



<li><strong>Kingpin</strong></li>



<li><strong>Myth</strong></li>



<li><strong>Oath</strong></li>



<li><strong>Shiv</strong></li>



<li><strong>Shrike</strong></li>



<li><strong>Void</strong></li>



<li><strong>Zeph</strong></li>
</ol>

<p>CD Projekt Red has confirmed that Cyberpunk 2077 is getting another new show adaptation on Netflix.</p>



<p>“I’m also very happy to announce that we’re working on another animation project set in the Cyberpunk universe, which will be released on Netflix,” CD Projekt Red Chief Financial Officer Piotr Nielubowicz said during the <a href="https://www.cdprojekt.com/en/wp-content/uploads-en/2024/11/cd-projekt-group-presentation-q3-2024.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">company’s earnings call</a> on Tuesday.</p>







<p>There was a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/netflix-releases-trailers-for-cyberpunk-devil-may-cry-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">teaser for a new project</a> from Netflix released in September. However, nothing had been officially announced by CD Projekt Red before the call on November 26. </p>



<p>No other details for the upcoming project were announced by the studio. That information is expected to come in the coming weeks and months. Cyberpunk: Edgerunners, a spin-off of the series, is currently available to watch on Netflix. That series was produced by Studio Trigger.</p>



<p>In addition to the outside projects of the series, CD Projekt Red is continuing work on the sequel to Cyberpunk 2077. Known as Project Orion, the game currently has 64 people —  just under 10% of the company — working on it. The game is expected to come after the release of the next game in The Witcher series, Project Polaris.</p>

<p>Are you on the hunt for all the legendary artifacts in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/stalker-2-review-heart-of-chornobyl/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">STALKER 2: Heart of Chornobyl</a>? The Zone is a dangerous place full of wonder and money-making opportunities, and the artifacts you’ll encounter prove to be some of the most lucrative. But they’re also liable to end your run. Here’s a look at the eight legendary artifacts worth the risk!</p>



<h2 id="h-there-are-eight-legendary-artifacts-in-stalker-2">There Are Eight Legendary Artifacts in STALKER 2</h2>



<p>There are eight legendary artifacts in STALKER 2: Heart of Chornobyl: Compass, Hypercube, Weird Ball, Weird Flower, Liquid Rock, Weird Nut, Heart of Chornobyl, and Thunderberry. We have the descriptions and effects of all these artifacts, so you have the luxury of picking and choosing what you’ll look for!</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Compass</strong>: A legendary artifact that can be found in gravitational anomalies. It is believed that whoever discovers and holds the Compass will gain the ability to navigate the Zone safely. Maximum Radiation, Maximum Physical Protection.</li>



<li><strong>Hypercube</strong>: A legendary artifact that can be found in thermal anomalies. The full potential of this artifact has not yet been discovered, but it emits ultra-long radio waves and could be used in space navigation. Maximum Thermal Protection, Maximum Radiation, and Maximum Bleeding Protection.</li>



<li><strong>Weird Ball</strong>: A child’s oddly heavy ball, this legendary “altered item” is often mentioned in hushed tones. If you equip it, it is said to reduce bullet damage in combat while standing still. Unique Effect—Reduces bullet damage when standing still.</li>



<li><strong>Weird Flower</strong>: A unique-looking flower, this legendary “altered item” is often not directly mentioned. If you sleep with this flower on your belt, its fragrance can mask your scent for a limited time. Unique Effect—Sleeping with the flower will cause its fragrance to mask your scent, though the effect diminishes over time.</li>
</ul>







<ul>
<li><strong>Liquid Rock</strong>: A legendary artifact that can be found in acid anomalies. The Liquid Rock exhibits properties that allow for migraine management. It must be carried on one’s person to ensure that it works. Maximum Radio Protection, Maximum Chemical Protection.</li>



<li><strong>Weird Nut</strong>: A nut that is eerily cold to the touch, this legendary “altered item” is rumored to promote rapid blood coagulation when on your person, though the wounds take longer to heal. Unique Effect—Promotes rapid blood coagulation when attached to your belt, but the wounds will take longer to heal.</li>



<li><strong>Heart of Chornobyl</strong>: A mythical artifact that functions as a psi-radiation amplifier. The degree of amplification depends on the source’s capabilities and characteristics. Its properties are not fully understood, but it is thought to encapsulate the original structure of the Zone’s matter. Unique Effect—Used in Kalmanov ending.</li>



<li><strong>Thunderberry</strong>: A legendary artifact found in electro anomalies. When heated gradually to 78 degrees Celsius, it produces vibrant collective hallucinations that present a utopia. Maximum Radiation, Maximum Endurance.</li>
</ul>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/top-down-roguelike-guidus-zero-launches-in-early-access<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Venture into The Scar and take on corrupted enemies in real-time grid-based combat.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Steam’s Early Access recently got a new addition: Guidus Zero, a top-down dungeon crawling roguelike developed by indie South Korean studio Izzle.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The story takes place in a world where a war raged for ages without a clear victor. After it ended, the central continent was declared a neutral zone. A massive sinkhole called The Scar opened on that continent, and from its depths comes a mysterious substance known as Black Blood that spawns corrupted beings. It’s unknown how this sinkhole came to be, where the Black Blood is coming from, or what waits in the deepest regions of The Scar. That’s where you come in.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">You’ll join a cast of characters in The Scar, traveling deeper and deeper beneath the surface while facing all manner of enemies that have been corrupted by the Black Blood. You’ll have several different controllable characters to choose from, each with their own strengths and abilities. There’s real-time action combat with a bit of a twist: You and your enemies move between tiles on a grid in which you can only navigate in the four cardinal directions.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">When an enemy is about to attack, an exclamation mark will appear above their head and the ground will be highlighted showing where their attack will land. Different enemies have different attack patterns — some strike directly in front of them, some hit a long line, and others target a larger area of the grid. You’ll face several enemies at a time, forcing you to stay on your toes and react quickly to dodge attacks. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">While moving, you can roll to make yourself invincible, but each roll consumes stamina. And since you can’t move diagonally, you’ll need to be strategic about which direction you move and how often you roll. You don’t want to end up trapped between attacks you can’t avoid.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Combat isn’t all about avoiding damage, though. You need to be able to dish it out too, but how you do that changes depending on what character you pick. Before each run, you’ll choose a character and their starting trait. In classic RPG fashion, killing enemies gains experience, which makes you level up.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As you level up, you’ll unlock choices for skill upgrades that are unique to the trait you picked at the start of the run. These will define the playstyle of that run, so even if you play the same character, runs can play differently depending on the starting trait and upgrades you pick. Your levels and progression selections are exclusive to that run, so when you die, they’ll all reset.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Not everything will reset, though. During the course of a run, you’ll come across ore veins you can break to obtain stones, which have their own stats. All the stones in your bag will add together, and reaching certain stat thresholds will give your character buffs. You can equip stones in available slots, which will preserve them even after your run ends. Any unequipped stones in your bag when your run ends will be converted into stone fragments, which can serve as currency or be reforged into new stones by an NPC blacksmith.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">During each run, you can also discover special rooms with treasure chests where you can find artifacts. They grant unique buffs and improve your abilities, and over time can build up stacks of elemental effects. If an artifact reaches five stacks, it becomes bonded with a spirit that corresponds to that element and allows you to use unique elemental attacks and effects.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Becoming bonded to Ignis, the fire spirit, gives you access to a burn debuff that deals continuous damage. Atlen, the water spirit, slows enemies and freezes those with a wet debuff. Rathorus, the lightning spirit, inflicts a shock debuff that deals additional damage. Enryl, the wind spirit, increases your movement speed and enhances multi-hits with a sprint buff. Terrania, the earth spirit, inflicts a petrify debuff that causes fragments to shoot out when you attack petrified enemies.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This all adds up to a roguelike with a classic “one more run” feeling. Stones provide permanent growth, while your choices for character, starting trait, and ability upgrades make every run different. If you’re interested in checking out Guidus Zero, it’s available now in Early Access <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3072640?utm_source=IGN&amp;utm_campaign=EarlyAccess_PR&amp;utm_medium=PR&amp;utm_content=Native_Article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">on Steam</a>. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">They’re celebrating launch by offering a 10% discount that will last until Dec. 9. Guidus Zero is also considering future releases for Xbox and Nintendo Switch, but a console release has not been officially announced.</p></section><div><h3 data-cy="object-summary-embed-title">In This Article</h3></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/dayz-dev-uses-beatles-song-to-respond-to-players-review-bombing-27-dlc-for-being-too-expensive<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Long-running zombie game <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/dayz-stand-alone">DayZ</a> is currently embroiled in a Steam review-bomb campaign after releasing $27 DLC deemed “too expensive” by disgruntled players.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">DayZ Frostline launched in October priced $26.99. The expansion adds a new snow-covered map called Sakhal that spans 83km² (not including ice sheets). There’s a winter wilderness with new challenges and opportunities for survival. “Brace yourself for a truly immersive adventure where the environment itself is as much your adversary as the infected and other survivors,” reads developer Bohemia Interactive’s description.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">DayZ players, however, have reacted negatively to Frostline’s price, with Steam user reviews saying it’s “not worth the money.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“... Sakhal does have SOME neat stuff to it, but it is absolutely NOT worth its asking price as of right now,” reads one negative review. “Maybe in time they'll add more interesting features to the map to justify its existence, but right now you can get much better maps for free and Bohemia knows it. If you really want a frozen hellhole experience, play Namalsk. But if you play DayZ on PC I'm sure you already have.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Recent reviews for Frostline now have the dreaded ‘mostly negative’ user review rating on Steam, which Bohemia boss Marek Spanel clearly takes issue with. In a <a href="https://x.com/maruksp/status/1861353665455366218" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tweet</a>, Spanel revealed that the Czech studio has received less than 10 cents for each hour of live online gaming DayZ has tracked since the game went live over a decade ago, when you factor in the average hours played and dollars spent by the game’s eight million users.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Yet DayZ Frostline is currently being review-bombed on the same platform for being too expensive: $26.99 for ‘just a map,’ and some users demand ‘gimme more for less money,’ Spanel continued.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Hmm. Please Please Me.”</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">Did you know that 8 million users for whom we have data on Steam played for an average of 188 hours and paid an average of 30 USD gross in <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Dayz?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">#Dayz</a>? That means we received less than 10 cents for an hour of live online gaming, for which we host the online infrastructure and have been… <a href="https://t.co/zOMQNvEPtq" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/zOMQNvEPtq</a></p>— Marek Spanel (@maruksp) <a href="https://twitter.com/maruksp/status/1861353665455366218?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">November 26, 2024</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">That last line is a reference to the Beatles song, Please Please Me, which includes the lyrics: “I don't want to sound complaining, But you know there's always rain in my heart (in my heart), I do all the pleasing with you, It's so hard to reason with you, Whoa, yeah, why do you make me blue?”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Responding further to X / Twitter users, Spanel said “nobody is forcing anyone to buy DayZ Frostline; the base game is still running for all users.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The official DayZ account was perhaps a little more diplomatic, <a href="https://x.com/DayZ/status/1861419562027163746" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">quote-tweeting Spanel’s original post</a> to say it’s listening to the feedback.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We also don't forget about our amazing modding community - and yes, they've got tons of free maps that'll keep you busy if you are not ready to join people on frosty Sakhal just yet!” Bohemia added.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While continuing to update DayZ, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bohemia-used-a-live-concert-to-announce-arma-4-coming-in-2027">Bohemia is also working on Arma 4</a>, which recently received a release window.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

Unfortunately the reaction so far has been largely negative, and that’s because of the apparent prevalence of cheaters who are ruining the integrity of the mode. And yes, as has become Call of Duty tradition, console players are turning off crossplay in a bid to avoid PC cheaters.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Activision said it’s made over 19,000 ranked play bans since the mode launched, and that it was continuing to ramp up its AI systems with code optimizations to accelerate enforcements. “Thanks for your patience as our team continues to fight against cheaters,” Activision added.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The tweet was met with a healthy dose of scepticism from players, including high-profile Call of Duty content creators and pros. 100 Thieves founder Nadeshot, for example, called Activision’s tweet “complete propaganda.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“... I have played the same cheaters since day one and not a single one has even a scratch on ‘em,” he <a href="https://x.com/Nadeshot/status/1861245061368787123" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tweeted</a>. “How could there possibly be 19K accounts banned when the most egregious abusers are giving us the middle finger on the leaderboard? Are we crazy? What is going on?”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Cheating is not unique to Call of Duty of course, but it has become a significant reputational issue for Activision ever since the free-to-download battle royale Warzone exploded in popularity back in 2020. The mega publisher has spent millions of dollars developing its anti-cheat technology as well as pursuing cheat makers in the courts, with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-cheat-maker-ordered-to-pay-activision-over-14-million-in-damages-and-hand-over-domain-name"><u>a number of recent high-profile successes</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In October, ahead of the launch of Black Ops 6, Activision said that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/activision-says-it-wants-to-catch-and-remove-call-of-duty-cheaters-within-1-hour-of-them-being-in-their-first-match">it aimed to kick cheaters out of the game within one hour of them being in their first match</a>. Black Ops 6 launched with an updated version of Ricochet's kernel-level driver (this also applies to Warzone), with new machine-learning behavioral systems focused on speed of detection and the analysis of gameplay to combat aim bots in place. Upgrades were set to launch alongside ranked play.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"The people behind cheats are organized, illegal groups that pick apart every piece of data within our games to look for some way to make cheating possible," Activision said at the time. "These bad guys are not just some script kiddies poking around with code they found online. They are a collective who profit from exploiting the hard work of game developers across the industry.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"But cheat developers are flawed (clearly – they have to pretend to be good at video games). Every time they cheat, they leave breadcrumbs behind. We’re always looking for those breadcrumbs to find the bad actors and get them out of the game."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN. Find him on Twitter at @wyp100.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/throne-and-liberty-is-getting-the-new-spear-weapon-very-soon/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Today, NCSoft and Amazon Games announced that a new weapon type will be released very soon, on December 5, for the MMORPG Throne and Liberty: the spear. In a dedicated video, the developers went into what makes it unique compared to other melee weapons already in the game:</p>
<p><em>The spear is a fire-attribute close-range weapon. Although it's a melee weapon, you can gain combat advantages through its long reach and pocking plays with throwing mechanics. It enables combo-based combat with fast-tempo skills and has initiating skills that allow you to leap into battle instantly. Overall, it's a hybrid weapon that can fulfill both Tank and DPS roles – what we might call a Bruiser or Fighter – designed specifically for these roles. The existing four Ranged weapons have been performing relatively well in combat by utilizing distance advantages and positional elements.</em></p>
<p><em>Therefore, we needed a weapon that could change the tide of battle. The Spear's image started from concepts like Warrior, Berserker, and Assault Captain. It has defensive characteristics, good mobility, and many utility skills. We designed it to have strategic value on the battlefield. You can look forward to Spear skills useful for dealing with multiple opponents, combat through distance control, and special Spear-specific skills.&nbsp;</em></p>

<p>Following a <a href="https://wccftech.com/throne-and-liberty-already-had-3-million-players-in-its-debut-week-says-amazon/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">successful debut outside of Korea</a> (even in the face of <a href="https://wccftech.com/ncsoft-wants-to-grow-throne-and-liberty-into-a-respected-global-ip-but-cancels-two-games-amid-restructuring/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">internal restructuring at NCSoft</a>), Throne and Liberty just received four new endgame 2-Star Dungeons last week: Carmine Rage Island, Voidwastes, Island of Terror, and Valley of Slaughter.</p>
<p>A few days ago, Amazon Games Globalization Design Manager Daniel Lafuente (whom we interviewed before the game's launch) <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Y91MABfDFc" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> that the new PvP War Games feature will be introduced to Throne and LIberty on December 5 as well.</p>
<p><em>War Games provides a custom Lobby feature for Conquest battles or Rift Stones and Boon Stones. Within the War Games menu, players can create their custom lobby, selecting what stone they want to fight over, the number of teams that will fight, and the size of each team. Then players join in, and once the lobby is full, you start the match. My favorite thing is you can do private and public matches, so we think the use cases for players is going to be that huge competitive PVP guilds can use it for practices, while less competitive guilds can do inner Guild skirmishes with their friends.</em></p>
<p>There won't be any rewards related to War Games for the time being, but that might change in the future after Amazon and NCSoft have gathered the community's feedback.</p>

            <p>
Just when you thought you'd played all the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPGs</a> - maxed every last stat, drained the XP of every last creature, tap-danced your way along every branching questline - CD Projekt have announced that <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-witcher-4">The Witcher 4</a> is in "full-scale production".
</p><!--more-->
<p>
"I'm pleased to announce that several weeks ago it moved on to full-scale production," chief financial officer Piotr Nielubowicz said of the game, currently codenamed Polaris, during the company's <a href="https://www.cdprojekt.com/en/wp-content/uploads-en/2024/11/cd-projekt-group-presentation-q3-2024.pdf">latest quarterly earnings presentation</a> to investors (thanks, <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/the-witcher-4-has-entered-full-scale-production-cd-projekt-says/">VGC</a>). "Of all our projects, this one is currently the most far along, and we're starting the most intensive phase of development."
</p>
<p>
Game director Sebastian Kalemba has also been <a href="https://x.com/Skalemba/status/1861446070858846571">talking the announcement up on social media</a>. "No stopping now!" he thrilled. "Stay tuned for what's on the other side of the coin!" The post accompanies a photograph of a coin - see this article's header - on which are engraved rays of light above a cliffside and some runes. Do you know what, I bet there's a picture of a Witcher on the other side of that coin! Perhaps a picture of a Witcher accompanying the words "Witcher 4".
</p>
<p>
The next Witcher game may not be called The Witcher 4, mind you. I attended a sci-fi writing class once in which the tutor grouchily remarked that book publishers get leery about overtly episodic fantasy stories, because "why would I buy Frostblazen Book XII when I haven't bought and read Frostblazen Books I-XI". I imagine video game publishers have similar concerns. It's been a fair old while since The Witcher 3's release - calling it Witcher 4 might scare away players who missed the last game. Perhaps they'll give it an annoying subtitle, instead, or just chicken out and call it "The Witcher", as with Lords Of The Fallen.
</p><p>
As of this March, there were <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/witcher-4-is-more-than-the-witcher-3-in-new-clothing-promise-cdpr-as-over-400-devs-work-on-polaris">over 400 CD Projekt staff</a> working on Polaris. It'll be the first in a new trilogy of Witcher games. CD Projekt's other current endeavours include a Witcher 1 Remake, developed in collaboration with Fool's Theory, Project Sirius, a Witcher spin-off with multiplayer elements from The Molasses Flood, and Project Orion, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/cd-project-devs-want-to-call-out-big-problems-like-homelessness-and-the-wealth-gap-in-cyberpunk-2077-sequel">the next Cyberpunk game</a>. 
</p>
<p>
What does "full-scale production" mean? It's a blurry category, but basically, it's the longer part of development after the more open-ended <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/cd-projekt-latest-next-cyberpunk-game-might-have-multiplayer-witcher-4-enters-production-phase">pre-production phase</a> when things like character models, environments and combat systems are actually being made and finished. I am very much squinting at the tea leaves, here, but it's probably safe to say that CD Projekt will formally announce the thing and share a few videos and images next year.
