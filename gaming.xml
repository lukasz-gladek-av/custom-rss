The beauty of Splendor lies in its simplicity: It's a great game to bust out a family gathering for players of all ages and experience levels due to its intuitive ruleset and average 30-minute playtime. Once you get a handle on the basic premise of the game, there's room for plenty of strategy to come into play.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's an economic engine game designed around the concept that players are working to build an increasingly powerful economy to buy cards that earn them points (dubbed "prestige" in the world of Splendor). In good ol' Renaissance fashion, your currency is none other than gemstones, which are represented by multi-colored tokens. The end goal is to reach 15 prestige points, which you accumulate by purchasing cards worth variable amounts of points with the gems you collect. If you're spending your gems on cards wisely, you might even become eligible for a visit from a noble, which gives you a massive point boost. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Splendor is a race to the finish line among players, but this game doesn't make it easy. Whether it's your rival reserving a card you had your eye on or someone hoarding the already-limited supply of tokens that you needed to purchase the card you've been saving up for, there's plenty of curveballs along the way that make game sessions with friends and family ripe with tension and necessitate thorough planning. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">For the price you're paying, this is a fantastic board game to snag this December, whether it be for your own collection or a fun gift that you can count on arriving before the holidays. If you'd rather pick it up in-person, <a href="https://zdcs.link/Qrp7on?object_uuid=5eb6e6ed-179d-4100-b430-2408a5e13bfd&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Target is also selling Splendor at the same price</a> for Cyber Monday.

                <p>There's a new era for NASCAR games coming in 2025, but fans may want to grab the previous titles while they still can. Motorsport Games, the company that until recently held the rights to make NASCAR racing games, has announced that all of its NASCAR titles and associated DLC will be pulled from digital storefronts on December 31.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://twitter.com/MSportgames/status/1862534587206836467" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><div dir="ltr"><p>To the NASCAR game community!</p><p>From December 31, 2024, all NASCAR game titles and their DLC content will no longer be available for purchase on all digital storefronts but will remain available to play after this time. This includes the <a href="https://twitter.com/NASCARHeat?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@NASCARHeat</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/NASCARRivals?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@NASCARRivals</a>, and… <a href="https://t.co/7RyCQXuZUo" rel="nofollow ">pic.twitter.com/7RyCQXuZUo</a></p></div>  — Motorsport Games (@MSportgames) <a href="https://twitter.com/MSportgames/status/1862534587206836467?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 29, 2024</a></blockquote>              </div><p>The silver lining from that announcement is that titles like NASCAR Heat, NASCAR Rivals, and NASCAR: Ignition will be going on sale before the games are delisted. All of the affected games and their physical disc counterparts will remain playable after January 1, 2025, they just won't be directly available for online purchases. </p><p>NASCAR branded games date back to 1991 with Bill Elliott's NASCAR Challenge, and the license has been utilized by several different gaming publishers over the decades. The current NASCAR rights holder is iRacing, which reportedly plans to release NASCAR '25 across all consoles and PC in Fall 2025. </p><p>Real-life NASCAR racers have previously shown their support for games based on their events. Perhaps most notably, Ross Chastain credited NASCAR 2005 <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nascar-driver-uses-video-game-inspired-trick-on-final-lap-and-it-actually-worked/1100-6508780/" data-ref-id="1100-6508780">for his thrilling wallride finish in 2022</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-teases-squid-game-crossover-for-early-next-year<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>
There's another Call of Duty collaboration on the way. Following crossovers from the likes of Tomb Raider, Crash Bandicoot, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles">Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles</a>, and The Boys, Activision has revealed it's teaming up with <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/netflix">Netflix</a> to shove the streaming service's hugely popular Squid Game TV series into <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/call-of-duty-2024">Black Ops 6</a> and Warzone early next year.
</p>
<p>
Squid Game, which follows a group of players attempting to survive a series of deadly children's games in order to win a BIG CASH PRIZE, took the world by storm when it first aired on Netflix back in 2021. It's been a long time coming, but the show is finally set to return for a second series on 26th December, and Netflix's promotional efforts are now in full swing.
</p>
<p>
And so enter Call of Duty. Activision unveiled its impending Squid Game crossover via a thirty second teaser trailer, in which a dashingly behatted Operator discovers a mysterious envelope emblazoned with symbols one 'X' away from a PlayStation copyright claim. It all ends with the Call of Duty logo emerging in a sequence reminiscent of Squid Game's opening titles, after which we're informed the collaboration is set to begin in January 2025.

<p>
Beyond that, specifics are limited to the point of non-existent. We do know the crossover is coming to both Black Ops 6 and Warzone early next year, but whether it'll offer anything more substantial than romper-suit-style premium cosmetics remains to be seen.

Call of Duty's Squid Game collaboration won't be the first digital take on the hit Korean television show to barrel out in conjunction with Netflix's season two promotions, however. The streaming service's own internally developed Squid Game Unleashed - a multiplayer "party royale" for iOS and Android devices - launches for subscribers on 17th December. It's just one of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/netflix-has-over-80-games-currently-in-development-and-plans-to-launch-one-each-month">more than 80 titles currently in development</a> as part of Netflix's continuing push into the world of gaming, although one of its most intriguing projects - a new AAA game led by Halo creative head Joseph Staten - has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/netflix-closes-aaa-internal-studio-led-by-halo-creative-head-joseph-staten">now been cancelled</a>.
</p>
<p>
As for Call of Duty, it seems to be having a strong 2024. Microsoft recently announced Black Ops 6 <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-sets-records-for-game-pass-subscriber-adds-on-launch-day-says-microsoft">managed to set a record</a> for most "Game Pass subscribers adds on launch day" - a record previously held by <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/starfield-main-story-walkthrough-9352">Starfield</a> following its launch last year.

Some of the best current models are 32-inch QD-OLED panels with 4K resolution, super-fast 240Hz refresh rate, and the necessary ports to take full advantage of those specs on both PC and consoles (DisplayPort 1.4 and HDMI 2.1, respectively).</p><p>Here’s the rundown on these excellent monitors from <a href="https://us-store.msi.com/Monitors/Gaming-Monitors/MAG-321UPX-QD-OLED?filter=139">MSI</a>, <a href="https://shop.asus.com/us/90lm09t0-b013b0-rog-swift-oled-pg32ucdm.html">Asus</a>, <a href="https://www.jdoqocy.com/click-8836598-14581062?sid=vergebfcm2024&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lg.com%2Fus%2Fmonitors%2Flg-32gs95uv-w-gaming-monitor">LG</a>, <a href="https://www.kqzyfj.com/click-8836598-15850788?sid=vergebfcm2024&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hp.com%2Fus-en%2Fshop%2Fpdp%2Fomen-transcend-315-inch-uhd-240hz-oled-gaming-monitor-omen-transcend-32">HP</a>, and <a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8836598/type/dlg/https://www.dell.com/en-us/shop/alienware-32-4k-qd-oled-gaming-monitor-aw3225qf/apd/210-blmq/monitors-monitor-accessories">Alienware</a> — each around the $900 range and saving you up to $450 on their normal prices. </p><div><ul><li>Dell’s <strong>Alienware AW3225QF</strong> is the sole curved option in this list, on sale for $899.99 ($300 off) at <a href="https://howl.link/o5x5d02jjy56l">Best Buy</a> and <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.anrdoezrs.net%2Fclick-8836598-12839518%3Fsid%3Dvergebfcm2024%26url%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.dell.com%252Fen-us%252Fshop%252Falienware-32-4k-qd-oled-gaming-monitor-aw3225qf%252Fapd%252F210-blmq%252Fmonitors-monitor-accessories">Dell</a>.

I’m also not partial to curved monitors, but if that’s your bag then the Alienware becomes the easy choice.</p><p>Feel free to share in the comments if you’re eyeing up any of these or own one yourself and have some thoughts.</p><div><form><div><h2>Verge Deals</h2><p> / <span>Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox weekly.</span></p></div></form></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>A new report alleges that PC hardware company NZXT's PC rental program is "shady and manipulative." The video from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pomC1CfpC0" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gamers Nexus</a> (via <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/1/24310181/nzxt-pc-rental-program-gamers-nexus-investigation" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Verge</a>) accuses NZXT of changing prices and parts between "purchase" and "rental" versions of prebuilt PCs with the same (or similar) names.</p><p>For context, NZXT's Flex program allows customers to rent prebuilt gaming PCs starting at $59 (though a renter would need to provide a monitor, keyboard, and mouse). Gamers Nexus claims that specs and prices of prebuilt PC models change depending on whether you select "buy" or "rent." The exact prices and specs can change "day to day" according to the video.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pomC1CfpC0" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/0pomC1CfpC0" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>For example, the video shows that a "Player: Three Prime" model PC contained an Nvidia GeForce RTX 4090 if a customer was set to buy it, whereas the rental version contained an RTX 4080 Super. However, the performance estimates--showing expected frame rates in certain games--did not change between the two models, despite containing significantly different hardware. These specs allegedly changed multiple times while Gamers Nexus was completing its report.</p><p>The Flex program's alleged issues don't stop there. Gamers Nexus highlights the Flex program's price point. Within nine or so months, the price of renting one of NZXT prebuilds will outstrip the cost of buying the PC (or its component parts) outright, with no rent-to-own option. Additionally, the report calls outs the program's "aggressive" terms of service, which allegedly allow NZXT to sell data created or stored on the rented PC.</p><p>NZXT has released a response on <a href="https://x.com/NZXT/status/1863388904205799769" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">X/Twitter,</a> which states, "We are aware of the recent claims made against us and are actively reviewing the situation. Rest assured, we are committed to addressing this thoroughly and will share an official statement soon. Thank you for your patience as we work to provide clarity."</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/my-friend-and-i-have-finally-finished-lorelei-and-the-laser-eyes.1050141/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/lorelei-and-the-laser-eyes-end<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I started playing puzzle game <em>Lorelei and the Laser Eyes</em> shortly after its release back in May, and almost immediately realized it would be <a href="https://aftermath.site/lorelei-laser-eyes-tips-steam-nintendo" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">much better with a buddy</a>. And it was: it was useful to have a friend to talk over puzzles with, and cool to get to introduce a non-gaming friend to a game. And then it took us six months to actually <em>finish</em> it, because we are both adults with lives.</p><p>My friend and I got together infrequently for play sessions. Sometimes our schedules just couldn’t line up; other times, we’d meet up intending to play but then get distracted catching up on our lives until it got too late. (The main lesson this experience taught us was that we need to hang out more.) When we <em>did</em> play, we had a lot of fun. We both appreciated the game’s <a href="https://aftermath.site/lorelei-laser-eyes-puzzles-logic" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">logic</a>: how we knew we usually had the tools to solve a puzzle in front of us, and how the game generally makes it clear where to look for which puzzle’s clues. In puzzles that involved navigation, it was helpful to have one person look at a photo of a map or of the clues on their phone while the other steered our character.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>(Spoilers for </strong><strong><em>Lorelei and the Laser Eyes</em></strong><strong> follow.)</strong></p><p>In a lot of ways, <em>Lorelei </em>was a great game to play with someone who doesn’t play games much, given its pared-down controls and emphasis on puzzles rather than technical gaming skills. But it was still sometimes a challenge: your character doesn’t always steer so well, and my friend especially had trouble navigating the confusing perspective of the hotel’s backyard. The bug report puzzles gave us both a bit of trouble: while I haven’t played a lot of older games, I understood what these areas were referencing, but my friend got frustrated with the clunky inverted controls.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>I think our biggest mistake was how long we went between playing, which made it easy to forget what we were doing or what task we'd left off in the middle of. This was particularly a problem this weekend, when we had nothing left but logging into the supercomputer to end the game. We had a general sense of which pieces we needed, but we'd forgotten precisely what to do with them. Eventually, we relented and looked up a guide, only to realize with despair that we would have to go back to the mazes, parts of the game we were <em>totally</em> over. We had to wrack our brains to remember where to find the maze and how to get to its center <em>again</em>, and it definitely made the end of the game feel a little draggy.&nbsp;</p><p>Speaking of guides, we didn’t use them much, but we did reference them on occasion when we were totally stumped. We had a big debate about it every time before we did it, and we tried our best not to accidentally read ahead. I’ll admit guides were helpful when the solution to a puzzle involved a lot of trekking around, though we did feel a bit disappointed in ourselves when we did it.&nbsp;</p><p>Our running joke with the game was that the reward for every puzzle was going to be <em>another</em> puzzle, and this proved true once we finally got into the supercomputer. I don’t think either of us <em>loved</em> the end, though this might also have been a consequence of how long we went between playing. A lot of the game’s plot was a bit hazy in our memories, and my friend especially was annoyed with one last bit of clunky navigation. But we felt good about finally finishing the game, even if we'd long lost the thread on who was who and why it mattered. And while I can't speak for my friend, I at least had a lot of fun looking up other players' interpretations of the story now that I'd finally seen its conclusion.</p><p>We didn’t 100% the game, which we both feel OK with. There’s an entire map we seem to be missing, even though I can’t find any indication that there’s an area we missed, and some memories we didn’t unlock. While neither of us is motivated to poke around the post-credits game given how bad we've been with our schedules, we’ll see if I can stick to my contentment with where we ended up when I’m alone with my PC.</p><p>I promised to introduce my friend to <em>Return of the Obra Dinn</em> next, another puzzle game everyone I know loved but which I kind of bounced off all by myself. I have it on my Switch, which means we can play it on my friend’s TV, which means we can sit on her couch instead of my sad PC setup where one of us had to sit on the stepstool that functions as my apartment's only other chair.&nbsp;</p><p>So yeah: <em>Lorelei and the Laser Eyes</em> was a very good game that took us way too long to beat! Games with friends are fun! I can finally talk about it with everyone, long after everyone else is done with it! Come remember a game you surely beat ages ago and talk to me about it!</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

There are lots more games that are heavily discounted on PSN right now, from blockbuster PS5 exclusives to some equally amazing but lesser-known games that might not be on your radar. </p><p>You can currently get just about every major Sony first-party blockbuster from the last few years for around $30 or less. Here’s the full list to refresh your memory:</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><em>Helldivers 2 </em>- $31 (20 percent off)</li><li><em>Spider-Man 2 </em>- $40 (43 percent off)</li><li><em>God of War Ragnarok </em>- $30 (58 percent off)</li><li><em>Horizon Forbidden West: Complete Edition </em>- $40 (34 percent off)</li><li><em>Returnal </em>- $30 (58  percent off)<br></li><li><em>Ratchet and Clank Rift Apart Deluxe Edition </em>- $40 (50 percent off)</li><li><em>Ghost of Tsushima: Director’s Cut </em>- $30 (58 percent off)</li><li><em>Death Stranding: Director’s Cut </em>- $20 (60 percent off)</li><li><em>The Last of Us Part I </em>- $30 (58 percent off)</li><li><em>The Last of Us Part II </em>- $25 (30 percent off)</li><li><em>Spider-Man Miles Morales </em>- $20 (60 percent off)</li><li><em>Demon’s Souls Deluxe Edition </em>- $50 (45 percent off)</li></ul></blockquote><p>Weirdly, a couple of the games are only on sale for the deluxe editions. Also, <em>Spider-Man Remastered</em> and<em> Sackboy: A Big Adventure</em> aren’t on sale at all. The remaster of <em>Horizon Zero Dawn</em> also just came out so it’s still full price and you can no longer get the original PS4 version that was usually on sale for just $10. From the above list, <em>Death Stranding</em> and<em> Ghost of Tsushima </em>are good pickups since both have sequels out next year. </p><p>But there are also a bunch of other games on sale on PSN right now.

<p>The next entry in the handheld PC market is coming from Lenovo, and it’s aiming to be a more affordable option for players looking to get their first device. And now, ahead of its reveal, the first look at the new Lenovo Legion Go S has appeared online.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/pc-gaming/exclusive-first-renders-of-the-budget-friendly-legion-go-s-pc-gaming-handheld-are-here-most-likely-powered-by-the-new-amd-z2-platform" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Windows Central</a> has been sent official renders for the new device that confirms past rumors of a white shell for the device. </p>



<figure></figure>



<p>As you can tell with the renders, the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-best-available-handheld-gaming-pcs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">device looks a lot like</a> the original Legion Go aside from a couple small button placement changes and touchpad removal. It also appears that, unlike the original Legion Go, there are no removable controllers.</p>



<p>According to past leaks, the Legion Go S will utilize AMD Ryzen Z2. This configuration — known as Rembrandt — features Zen3+ cores, which will likely put it less powerful than the Z1 Extreme system with Zen4 cores that the original Legion Go features. More specifically, the Ryzen Z2 series will have 8 CPU cores and could feature RDNA2 graphics.</p>



<p>It’s worth noting that none of the specs have been officially confirmed by Lenovo. Until that happens, some of the aforementioned features of the device could change. Lenovo is expected to reveal its new handheld systems at, or around, CES 2025 in January. The new next-generation of handheld PCs should also be revealed around the same time. </p>



<p>What do you think of the look and details of the Lenovo Legion Go S? Let us know down below, and join more discussions in the official&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums</a>.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">Tencent has unveiled its latest creation--an open-world survival game called Light of Motiram--and although the game's recently <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfAuAQw48oc">released trailer</a> is visually stunning, viewers can't help but notice <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1h1w4rv/tencent_announced_light_of_motiram_and_it_looks/" rel="nofollow ">the game bears a striking resemblance</a> to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/horizon-zero-dawn/">Horizon Zero Dawn</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/horizon-forbidden-west/">Horizon Forbidden West</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">Set in an ancient-yet-futuristic open world where players must craft items, maintain survival stats, and battle strange robotic beasts called Mechanimals, Light of Motiram certainly seems to be riffing on the Horizon aesthetic.

The airborne gadgets look nearly identical to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/destiny-2/">Destiny'</a>s Ghosts, and seem to have a somewhat similar function, scanning objects in the environment.

It says, "In memory of PS2 last production. Produced 160,636, 885 pcs during January 2000 - March 2013."

            <p>
As we thrust ourselves boots first into the season of giving, Amazon has announced its own bout of spirited subscriber-only generosity, bringing 18 titles to Prime Gaming in December.
</p>
<p>
December's offerings - as is customary for Prime Gaming - arrive over the course of several scheduled content drops, with <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/star-wars-bounty-hunter">Star Wars: Bounty Hunter</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/tomb-raider-underworld">Tomb Raider: Underworld</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/overcooked-2">Overcooked 2</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/call-juarez-gunslinger">Call of Juarez: Gunslinger</a>, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dredge-review-a-clever-fishing-sim-but-an-underwhelming-horror-game">fishing horror Dredge</a> all available to claim now.
</p>
<p>
Then, as December continues, Prime Gaming subscribers can get their mitts on the likes of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/quake-ii">Quake 2</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/planet-of-lana-review-pace-poise-and-something-more">beautiful side-scrolling puzzle-platformer Planet of Lana</a>.

Following the attack, Nakamura reverted to his villainous strategy, having promo videos (spoken in his native Japanese tongue) played on the big screen during Knight’s matches in an attempt to distract him. A Survivor Series match was set for LA Knight’s U.S. title. Overall, it was a decent way to reintroduce the former IWGP Heavyweight Champion into storylines.</p><p><strong>Survivor Series In-Ring Performance:</strong> Nakamura hardly missed in his match with LA Knight, while Knight seemed a bit off, not getting in as much offense as we’ve become accustomed to seeing from the rising star. The story of this somewhat one-sided match was to reestablish Nakamura as a credible opponent and remind the audience of his abilities, which both performers successfully accomplished. The finish saw an incredible back suplex from Nakamura to Knight, leading to a brutal-looking reverse DDT on the champ. This set up Knight to take a nasty running knee (Nakamura’s finisher, the Kinshasa) to the back of his head. The former Intercontinental Champion has now regained the United States Championship in dominating fashion.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="7fa90b385ef15b996cee19a1a983ec00" data-recommend-id="image://7fa90b385ef15b996cee19a1a983ec00" data-format="jpg" data-width="3936" data-height="2624" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Gunther standing victoriously" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Gunther standing victoriously" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="getty" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->WWE<!-- --> (<!-- -->Getty Images<!-- -->)</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="7fa90b385ef15b996cee19a1a983ec00" data-recommend-id="image://7fa90b385ef15b996cee19a1a983ec00" data-format="jpg" data-width="3936" data-height="2624" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Gunther standing victoriously" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p><strong>Last Month’s Ranking:</strong> No. 2</p><p><strong>Last Month’s Segments: </strong>After losing to WWE Undisputed World Champion Cody Rhodes at Crown Jewel last month, World Champion Gunther has struggled to maintain his confidence. In the build-up to Survivor Series, former World Champion Damian Priest often got the upper hand on Gunther during in-ring segments and even during a backstage altercation that Gunther initiated. The rivalry has been compelling, although it’s been challenging to convince fans that Priest would win the world title in Vancouver.</p><p><strong>Survivor Series In-Ring Performance:</strong> In something of a clash of styles, Gunther looked to neutralize Priest’s mixed martial arts moves by attacking his left arm throughout the battle, even adding additional pressure with a devastating kimura lock that had Priest writhing in pain. The outcome of the match was determined by Priest’s former best friend and stablemate in The Judgment Day, Finn Balor. Balor interfered by hitting a double foot stomp on Priest, who was on the floor outside, while the referee was distracted (surprise, surprise) by Gunther. The WWE World Champion capitalized on this, power-bombing the New York native and putting him to sleep with a sleeper hold. Another great outing from both competitors.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="c6c0c83d9f002c934c39f28e7f8e5636" data-recommend-id="image://c6c0c83d9f002c934c39f28e7f8e5636" data-format="jpg" data-width="6192" data-height="4128" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Candice LeRae entering competition" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Candice LeRae entering competition" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="getty" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->WWE<!-- --> (<!-- -->Getty Images<!-- -->)</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="c6c0c83d9f002c934c39f28e7f8e5636" data-recommend-id="image://c6c0c83d9f002c934c39f28e7f8e5636" data-format="jpg" data-width="6192" data-height="4128" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Candice LeRae entering competition" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p><strong>Last Month’s Ranking: </strong>N/A</p><p><strong>Last Month’s Segments:</strong> In recent weeks, the 39-year-old California native has enjoyed well-deserved success. After winning the WWE Women’s Speed Championship in October, Candice LeRae continues to gain momentum. In the lead-up to the Women’s WarGames match, LeRae was aligned with WWE Women’s Champion Nia Jax on SmackDown, often assisting Jax during matches. LeRae played a supporting role during the build to Survivor Series, participating in post-match brawls with the good guys.</p><p><strong>Survivor Series In-Ring Performance:</strong> LeRae, a talent who rarely gets the opportunity to fully showcase her abilities in a WWE ring, seized her moment at Survivor Series. Teaming up with current Women’s World Champion Liv Morgan, Nia Jax, current Money in the Bank briefcase holder Tiffany Stratton, and Morgan’s bodyguard Raquel Rodriguez, LeRae faced the challenge of standing out in a star-studded lineup—and she delivered spectacularly.</p><p>LeRae made an immediate impact by pushing Stratton out of harm’s way and executing an impressive double maneuver, performing a Code Breaker on Bayley while simultaneously nailing a Senton on Naomi. She utilized a chair as a launch pad for the move, making it one of the most impressive highlights of the night. LeRae epitomized the concept of making every moment in the ring count, solidifying herself as a standout performer in the chaotic Women’s WarGames match.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="d446d22b01550cff0c0e3f338cfa4303" data-recommend-id="image://d446d22b01550cff0c0e3f338cfa4303" data-format="jpg" data-width="6192" data-height="4128" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The New Bloodline ready to fight" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The New Bloodline ready to fight" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="getty" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->WWE<!-- --> (<!-- -->Getty Images<!-- -->)</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="d446d22b01550cff0c0e3f338cfa4303" data-recommend-id="image://d446d22b01550cff0c0e3f338cfa4303" data-format="jpg" data-width="6192" data-height="4128" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The New Bloodline ready to fight" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p><strong>Last Month’s Ranking: </strong>No. 8</p><p><strong>Survivor Series In-Ring Performance:</strong> The new Tribal Chief, Solo Sikoa, showcased his natural charisma and in-ring presence, solidifying himself as a credible threat to Roman Reigns. Sikoa wasted no time making an impact in the Bloodline match. Early on, he unleashed brutal violence on Jimmy and Jey Uso, slamming a steel door into their heads in a shocking display of dominance.</p><p>Taking charge of his bad-guy team (Tonga, Loa, Reed, and Fatu), Sikoa orchestrated a devastating beatdown of the good guys (Zayn, Punk, Jimmy, and Jey) in the ring. In a dramatic moment, Sikoa attempted to exile his cousin Reigns from the match by unveiling a steel chain and padlock, setting the stage for high-stakes drama. He came close to incapacitating Reigns with two Samoan Spikes, leading to a thrilling false finish. However, the Uso brothers countered with a perfectly timed double superkick.</p><p>Sikoa was pivotal in the match’s climactic moments, enduring an all-out assault by the babyfaces, ultimately falling to Reigns in a decisive conclusion. Despite the loss, Sikoa demonstrated his star potential, proving that his success hinges on the caliber of opponents and storylines he’s paired with.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="9e720de88da21e60f28ca3e320425769" data-recommend-id="image://9e720de88da21e60f28ca3e320425769" data-format="jpg" data-width="5518" data-height="3679" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Jacob Fatu in the middle of action" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Jacob Fatu in the middle of action" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="getty" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->WWE<!-- --> (<!-- -->Getty Images<!-- -->)</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="9e720de88da21e60f28ca3e320425769" data-recommend-id="image://9e720de88da21e60f28ca3e320425769" data-format="jpg" data-width="5518" data-height="3679" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Jacob Fatu in the middle of action" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p><strong>Last Month’s Ranking: </strong>N/A</p><p><strong>Last Month’s Segments:</strong> Since debuting in WWE earlier this year, the “Samoan Werewolf” Jacob Fatu has been a force to be reckoned with, striking fear in his opponents from the start. Already a former WWE Tag Team Champion, Fatu is just beginning to make his mark. </p><p>Following his standout performance at WWE Crown Jewel, Fatu would often be the last man standing after on-screen brawls with the OG Bloodline, demonstrating his dominance. His momentum continued as he secured a critical victory against WarGames opponent and older cousin Jey Uso, earning his bad-guy Bloodline team the all-important WarGames advantage.</p><p><strong>Survivor Series In-Ring Performance:</strong> It’s clear that someone in WWE management sees immense potential in Jacob Fatu. Upon entering the cage, Fatu faced an immediate double-team from the Usos. While this would have been a major setback for most WWE superstars, the Samoan powerhouse quickly turned the tide. He neutralized Jimmy Uso by hurling the multi-time tag champion into the unforgiving steel frame of the cage and shrugged off a Samoan Drop from former Intercontinental Champion Jey Uso.</p><p>Fatu displayed incredible athleticism, hitting a breathtaking handstand springboard moonsault on Jey Uso, showcasing his unique blend of power and agility. However, the match took a scary turn when Fatu appeared to botch a top-rope move intended for CM Punk, resulting in legitimate pain to his leg. Despite this setback, the resilient Bloodline member pushed through to finish the match, proving his toughness and determination.</p><p>It’s safe to say that Jacob Fatu, the younger cousin of the Usos and older cousin of Solo Sikoa, has solidified his place as a rising star in WWE. His performance at Survivor Series confirmed he is here to stay.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="0e671d482cb665d4fb1a30be6c3564d1" data-recommend-id="image://0e671d482cb665d4fb1a30be6c3564d1" data-format="jpg" data-width="8134" data-height="5425" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Boston Reed jumping off a steel cage" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Boston Reed jumping off a steel cage" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="getty" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->WWE<!-- --> (<!-- -->Getty Images<!-- -->)</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="0e671d482cb665d4fb1a30be6c3564d1" data-recommend-id="image://0e671d482cb665d4fb1a30be6c3564d1" data-format="jpg" data-width="8134" data-height="5425" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Boston Reed jumping off a steel cage" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p><strong>Last Month’s Ranking: </strong>No. 6</p><p><strong>Last Month’s Segments:</strong> With Seth Rollins currently in his rearview, Bronson Reed turned his attention to his next challenge. Reed defeated former World Champion Rollins on <em>Monday Night Raw</em>, leading to Rollins’ removal from current storylines once again. The “Big” superstar made a significant impact on the November 15th edition of <em>WWE SmackDown</em>, aligning himself with the Bloodline in preparation for a massive 5-on-5 WarGames cage match at Survivor Series. </p><p>During a beatdown of the OG Bloodline, Reed hit a monstrous “Tsunami” on Roman Reigns, which the Original Tribal Chief sold as though his ribs were cracked—an incredible compliment from WWE’s top superstar. Reed fit right in with the Bloodline and carried serious momentum going into the premium live event.</p><p><strong>Survivor Series In-Ring Performance:</strong> Not only is Reed impressive at his size, but his instincts should be lauded. During the WarGames match, he took control of an unfortunate situation when his tag partner Jacob Fatu missed a moonsault attempt by quickly hitting a Senton on Fatu’s intended target, CM Punk. Another huge spot in the match was Bronson climbing to the top of the cage, aiming to crush Reigns, who was laid out on a table. </p><p>However, Punk pulled Reigns out of the way, causing Reed to crash through the table. Despite his team losing to Sami Zayn, The Usos, CM Punk, and Roman Reigns, Bronson undoubtedly established himself as a top performer.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="25bfef0cc13e3b253348fab6473566bb" data-recommend-id="image://25bfef0cc13e3b253348fab6473566bb" data-format="jpg" data-width="6192" data-height="4128" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Iyo Sky getting ready to enter the ring" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Iyo Sky getting ready to enter the ring" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="getty" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->WWE<!-- --> (<!-- -->Getty Images<!-- -->)</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="25bfef0cc13e3b253348fab6473566bb" data-recommend-id="image://25bfef0cc13e3b253348fab6473566bb" data-format="jpg" data-width="6192" data-height="4128" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Iyo Sky getting ready to enter the ring" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p><strong>Last Month’s Ranking:</strong> N/A</p><p><strong>Last Month’s Segments:</strong> The original Damage Control (stylized as Damage CTRL) member has gained momentum lately. After recently winning a battle royal to determine who would face World Champion Liv Morgan, the “Genius of the Sky” found herself involved in the 5-on-5 WarGames match at Survivor Series. Iyo Sky’s introduction to this storyline added significant value, as she brings experience and unmatched natural athleticism.</p><p><strong>Survivor Series In-Ring Performance:</strong> Sky never disappoints in high-pressure environments. From her introduction to the match, Sky commanded attention as she executed a breathtaking moonsault from the top of the cage, with a purple garbage can covering half her body, eliciting a roar of approval from the audience. The former NXT Champion more than earned her spot on this list with her bravery and consistently impressive moveset.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="5ef7138e45fbf2adf3d66578c2890d2c" data-recommend-id="image://5ef7138e45fbf2adf3d66578c2890d2c" data-format="jpg" data-width="6192" data-height="4128" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Liv Morgan and Raquel Rodriquez entering the match" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Liv Morgan and Raquel Rodriquez entering the match" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="getty" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->WWE<!-- --> (<!-- -->Getty Images<!-- -->)</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="5ef7138e45fbf2adf3d66578c2890d2c" data-recommend-id="image://5ef7138e45fbf2adf3d66578c2890d2c" data-format="jpg" data-width="6192" data-height="4128" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Liv Morgan and Raquel Rodriquez entering the match" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p><strong>Last Month’s Ranking:</strong> No. 7</p><p><strong>Last Month’s Segments:</strong> Liv Morgan focused on maintaining her momentum following her historic win at this year’s WWE Crown Jewel event in Saudi Arabia. After weeks of tensions with Iyo Sky and WWE Tag Champions Jade Cargill and Bianca Belair, a match between them became inevitable. On a recent edition of Monday Night Raw, Iyo Sky earned the opportunity to challenge Morgan, further intensifying the rivalry with the “Genius of the Sky.”<br></p><p>The WWE Women’s World Champion, alongside her bodyguard Raquel Rodriguez, was unsuccessful in defeating Cargill and Belair for the tag titles, foreshadowing a potential rematch. Following an attack on Cargill during an episode of WWE SmackDown, former WWE Champion Bayley was added to the mix, setting the stage for the 5-on-5 Survivor Series WarGames match.</p><p><strong>Survivor Series In-Ring Performance:</strong> One thing that stands out about Morgan is her unmatched ability to sell danger. When the World Champion entered the match, she locked eyes with Rhea Ripley, who glared at her with pure hatred. This prompted Morgan to grab a bat in an effort to defend herself. She attempted to cripple Ripley with bat swings reminiscent of Juan Soto’s World Series highlights.</p><p>More creativity came when Morgan executed her Oblivion finisher on Bayley while Bayley was holding a chair. Although the move didn’t look as impressive as likely intended, it was unique enough to be appreciated. Ripley ultimately defeated Team Liv, surprisingly pinning Morgan.</p><p>Despite some sloppy moments in the match (such as Nia Jax mistiming spots, including weak chair shots on Naomi and Bayley), the finish was strong, and the crowd appeared to thoroughly enjoy it. Morgan continues to be a shining light whenever she’s on television.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="6ba9e30e2d2b337a316810ae80b3ad40" data-recommend-id="image://6ba9e30e2d2b337a316810ae80b3ad40" data-format="jpg" data-width="6192" data-height="4128" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Rhea Ripley staring at the match to come" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Rhea Ripley staring at the match to come" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="getty" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->WWE<!-- --> (<!-- -->Getty Images<!-- -->)</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="6ba9e30e2d2b337a316810ae80b3ad40" data-recommend-id="image://6ba9e30e2d2b337a316810ae80b3ad40" data-format="jpg" data-width="6192" data-height="4128" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Rhea Ripley staring at the match to come" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p><strong>Last Month’s Ranking:</strong> N.A</p><p><strong>Last Month’s Segments:</strong> After returning to WWE television following an eye injury, former Women’s World Champion Rhea Ripley’s primary objective each week was to destroy the women who kept her out of action for weeks. Ripley versus Liv Morgan inside a steel structure felt like a natural progression. Now sporting a protective face mask, the former Judgment Day member was highly motivated, telling her tag partners for WarGames that she was solely focused on Morgan. Generally speaking, this was the less intriguing of the two advertised WarGames matches. However, the subplot of “who attacked Jade” added an adequate amount of interest.</p><p><strong>Survivor Series In-Ring Performance:</strong> As soon as Ripley left the cage, all the bad guys (Nia Jax and Raquel Rodriguez) in the ring waited to confront her, showcasing her intimidation factor. Amid chants of “This is awesome” from the audience, Ripley displayed her brawling prowess by breaking a toilet seat over Rodriguez’s back.</p><p>The 28-year-old superstar also demonstrated her intelligence during the match, capitalizing on her tag partner Iyo Sky’s use of a fire extinguisher to handcuff Rodriguez. The match’s finish saw Ripley deliver a devastating Riptide finisher to Morgan off the ropes and through a table. It was a satisfying conclusion to a rough WarGames match and a strong reminder of why Ripley has remained near the top of WWE’s pecking order for years.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="7c20367f0c0bcb587c7715427e0ce744" data-recommend-id="image://7c20367f0c0bcb587c7715427e0ce744" data-format="jpg" data-width="6192" data-height="4128" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Roman Reigns leading the way" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Roman Reigns leading the way" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="getty" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->WWE<!-- --> (<!-- -->Getty Images<!-- -->)</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="7c20367f0c0bcb587c7715427e0ce744" data-recommend-id="image://7c20367f0c0bcb587c7715427e0ce744" data-format="jpg" data-width="6192" data-height="4128" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Roman Reigns leading the way" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p><strong>Last Month’s Ranking:</strong> No. 5</p><p><strong>Last Month’s Segments:</strong> The Original Tribal Chief has been trying to get his hands on his real-life cousin Solo Sikoa for months, eager to face him in a one-on-one match, though Sikoa has made it clear he’s not interested. The new Bloodline leader defeated the former World Champion at Crown Jewel in a tag team match, serving as a catalyst for the buildup to WarGames at Survivor Series.</p><p>In the weeks leading up to the event, Reigns and his cousins, Jimmy and Jey Uso, were searching for teammates for Survivor Series. After finally convincing OG Bloodline member Sami Zayn to rejoin their team, the good guys were still in need of a fifth member to complete the qualifications for the 5-on-5 match. In a shocking twist, the returning “Wise Man,” WWE Hall of Famer Paul Heyman, introduced the fifth member for the OG Bloodline team: none other than the original “Paul Heyman Guy,” CM Punk.</p><p>Reigns shares an extensive history with Punk, as the former World Champion served as a mercenary for Punk during his debut. This made for absolutely extraordinary television leading up to the 38th annual Survivor Series event.</p><p><strong>Survivor Series In-Ring Performance:</strong> Upon entering the ring, Reigns looked spectacular, scaling the WarGames cage (after Sikoa attempted to lock him out with his own chain) and hitting a diving crossbody on Tama Tonga, Tonga Loa, Jacob Fatu, Bronson Reed, and Solo Sikoa. Even while focused on his offense, Reigns ensured the story of the match remained intact. At one point, Reigns helped each of his teammates to their feet—except Punk—adding tension to their dynamic. This seemed to be a response to Punk pushing Reigns aside (similar to Candice LeRae in her match) to enter the match before him, upsetting the Original Tribal Chief.</p><p>Reigns continued to dominate, landing a low blow on Fatu and delivering a massive spear to Solo. The Head of the Table secured the win after all of his teammates (Sami Zayn, Jimmy and Jey Uso, and CM Punk) surrounded Sikoa, allowing each to land a shot on him. Punk hit the Go to Sleep on Solo, and Reigns finished the match with a bone-rattling spear, earning the elusive pinfall victory. It was an outstanding way to end Survivor Series.</p></div></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The worlds of Call of Duty and Squid Game are set to collide in an epic Black Ops 6 event for the ages. The shock of the announcement was quickly replaced by hype and thoughts the event could be a banger. Let’s see what’s in store for us all when we become contestants in Activision’s newest game.</p>



<p>I’ve learned not to be surprised by Call of Duty events anymore. This sentiment went out the window when Operation Monarch had me gunning down Godzilla and King Kong in Warzone’s Caldera. I’ve also clashed with the Colossal Titan, and seen soccer GOAT Lionel Messi battle with bullets. Now is the turn of Squid Game in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/black-ops-6-guides/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Ops 6</a>.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/squid-game-call-of-duty/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Squid Game and Call of Duty Black Ops 6 Collab</a> was announced on Dec. 2, 2024, and it could be one of the most memorable in history.</p>



<h2 id="h-black-ops-6-amp-squid-game-event-release-period">Black Ops 6 &amp; Squid Game Event Release Period</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Will you risk it all? Credit to Activision</figcaption></figure>



<p>The Black Ops 6 and Squid Game event doesn’t have a specific date yet, but we do know it’s currently penciled in to arrive in <strong>January 2025</strong>.</p>



<p>The Call of Duty x Squid Game Teaser trailer—released on the official <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@CallofDuty" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Call of Duty YouTube channel</a>—is only 29 seconds long, but it features some teasing imagery, along with the January 2025 statement.</p>

<p>Black Ops 6 and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/warzone-season-1-reloaded-patch-notes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Warzone Season 1 Reloaded</a> is expected to launch around this period, so stay tuned for lots of incoming content all at once.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-to-expect-from-black-ops-6-amp-squid-games-event">What to Expect From Black Ops 6 &amp; Squid Games Event</h2>



<p>Activision has yet to pull the curtain back on any Black Ops 6 &amp; Squid Game event details for now—which is a shame as I’m eager to know what’s coming, but it’s fun to dream.</p>



<p>If you didn’t know Squid Game is one of the most successful TV series, ever—period. It’s critically acclaimed, won countless awards, and surpassed billions in terms of viewership. </p>



<p>Based on Squid Game’s content (and previous CoD events) I would expect to see a raft of <strong>Squid Game Operator Skins</strong>—with Squid Game uniforms likely to sell like hotcakes. I also think a <strong>special limited-time mode</strong> based on the show is a given, and it’s hard not to imagine it not being either Red Light, Green Light, or some sort of multi-stage Gauntlet Mode eliminating players. </p>



<p>Finally, expect a ton of objectives and tasks related to the event, offering an array of bonuses: <strong>Double XP Tokens, Emblems, Sprays</strong>, and the usual CoD goodie bag of cosmetics.</p>



<p>Please keep checking back as we will update this page the second we learn more about the exciting Black Ops 6 event.</p>

<p>Counter-Strike has been the most popular competitive shooter for well over a decade, spawning an esports scene that features several legendary tournaments each calendar year. Even after the switch to Counter-Strike 2, the scene remains as popular as ever thanks to its plethora of tournaments, including the illustrious Majors.</p>



<p>Here are the best Counter-Strike tournaments to look forward to in 2025.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-best-counter-strike-2-tournaments-in-2025">Best Counter-Strike 2 Tournaments in 2025</h2>



<h3 id="h-iem-katowice">IEM Katowice</h3>



<p>The Intel Extreme Masters series of tournaments have been a staple of Counter-Strike esports for years. Katowice has been the setting for several excellent events for more than a decade, and 2025 will be no different. Winning Katowice also gets a team one step closer to winning the Intel Grand Slam and its separate $1 million prize.</p>



<ul>
<li>Dates: January 29, 2025 – February 9, 2025</li>



<li>Number of Teams Attending: 24</li>



<li>Prize Pool: $1,000,000 (estimated, based on previous iterations)</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-blast-rivals-spring-2025">BLAST Rivals Spring 2025</h3>



<p>BLAST has been a regular feature in the Counter-Strike tournament schedule since 2017, and earned the honor of hosting the last CS:GO Major before the switch to CS2. In 2025, <a href="https://blast.tv/cs/news/BLAST-premier-updated-format" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">BLAST is switching its tournament format</a>, with seasons that culminate in a Rivals tournament that crowns the top team in the world.</p>



<ul>
<li>Dates: April 28, 2025 – May 4, 2025</li>



<li>Number of Teams Attending: 8</li>



<li>Prize Pool: TBD</li>
</ul>

<p>The Majors are the most prestigious events in the Counter-Strike circuit, and in 2025 the Major returns to North America for the first time since 2018. BLAST will organize just its second Major ever in Austin, Texas, which will also be <a href="https://www.hltv.org/news/40062/sources-majors-to-expand-to-32-teams-from-2025" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the last Major</a> to utilize the Regional Major Rankings events to determine qualification.</p>



<ul>
<li>Dates: June 9, 2025 – June 22, 2025</li>



<li>Number of Teams Attending: 24</li>



<li>Prize Pool: $1,250,000</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-the-cs2-winter-major">The CS2 Winter Major</h3>



<p>The second of the two Majors scheduled for 2025 is still a long ways away. StarLadder will <a href="https://www.sheepesports.com/articles/sources-cs2-the-second-2025-major-will-be-organized-by-starladder-in-budapest/en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">reportedly host the Major</a> for the first time since before the COVID-19 pandemic, in Budapest, Hungary, though that information has not yet been confirmed by Valve. This will be the biggest Major yet, with the format expected to grow to include 32 teams.</p>



<ul>
<li>Dates: December 1, 2025 – December 14, 2025 (reported)</li>



<li>Number of Teams Attending: 32</li>



<li>Prize Pool: $1,250,000</li>
</ul>



<p>These are just the biggest events of the year. The beauty of the Counter-Strike ecosystem lies in how large the scene is as a whole, with hundreds of events each year ranging from top-tier international tournaments to local LANs.</p>

                <p>It's been almost 10 years since The Witcher 3: The Wild Hunt hit consoles. While the next installment in the series is still a ways away, CD Projekt can't wait to show fans what it has in store for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/the-witcher-4-release-date-trailer-news/2900-5228/" data-ref-id="2900-5228">The Witcher 4</a>, which has officially entered <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-witcher-4-is-now-officially-in-production-new-teaser-image-revealed/1100-6528058/" data-ref-id="1100-6528058">into full-scale production</a>.</p><p>Talking to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/technical-ambition-optimism-and-timeframes-what-we-learned-about-the-witcher-4-from-speaking-to-cd-projekt-red" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Eurogamer</a>, CD Projekt higher-ups--including CEO Michał Nowakowski and vice president of technology Charles Tremblay--confirmed that The Witcher 4 will be "bigger" and "better" than The Witcher 3 and Cyberpunk 2077.</p><p>"I think that we have some cool stuff going, and hopefully that will have some good showcase [of the technology]. The only thing I will say is that changing the tech for us does not change the fact that we always will be ambitious," said Trembley. "And the next game we do will not be smaller, and it will not be worse. So it will be better, bigger, greater than The Witcher 3, it will be better than Cyberpunk--because for us, it's unacceptable [to launch that way]. We don't want to go back."</p><p>Another thing the company doesn't want to go back to is how it markets the game. It wants to only begin the game's marketing campaign until it's truly ready, something it learned the hard way with Cyberpunk 2077. Nowakowski noted that they will still release teaser videos and other "crumbs" to stir reactions from fans to secure those preorders. However, it seems like the large-scale, big-budget trailers and assets will be reined in until the studio has a more solid release date in mind.</p><p>"I want to stress: it doesn’t mean we would not tease or drop some cool assets before [a full reveal]," said Nowakowski. "Because the marketing campaign, slightly earlier before the launch of the game, that's different than the actual, say, 'mass attack'. Mass attack is when you announce the date, you start collecting the pre-orders and it really is that race from that point, that moment, to the moment you launch the game."</p><p>No plot details of The Witcher 4 have been revealed, but at least CD Projekt management said that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/witcher-4-coming-2025-at-the-soonest/1100-6508062/">development on The Witcher 5 and The Witcher 6 should be smoother</a> because the foundation will already be in place. CD Projekt management also mentioned how The Witcher 5 and The Witcher 6 should take about three years each to develop, so fans can expect this newest Witcher trilogy to span into the 2030s.</p>

<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/stalker-2">Stalker 2: Heart of Chornobyl</a> is reportedly  being targeted by a Russian disinformation campaign falsely claiming the post-apocalyptic shooter scans players' computers in order to help the Ukranian government "locate citizens suitable for mobilisation".
</p>
<p>
As <a href="https://www.404media.co/stalker2-disinformation/">reported by 404 Media</a>, the claims have been made in a one-minute video - stamped with a fake Wired watermark, but in reality unconnected to the publication - that's being circulated on social media sites including Telegram and sent directly to journalists' inboxes.
</p>
<p>
The video falsely asserts "an embedded program was discovered in [Stalker 2]'s code that collects player data and transmits it to [developer <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/gsc-game-world">GSC Game World</a>]'s servers". It's claimed this data - said to include the device name, IP address, and the current location of the player - is "transmitted every second" without the user's knowledge and handed to the Ukranian government, because GSC "made a deal with the state" in order to secure funding for Stalker 2. "It's better to play using a VPN or boycott this game for your own safety", the video concludes.

<p>
404 Media says the video bears the hallmarks of an ongoing Russian disinformation campaign, previously dubbed Operation Matryoshka, intended to flood social media and journalists' inboxes with "false stories that usually paint NATO countries and Ukraine in a bad light, waste reporters' time, and make people distrust news outlets more broadly." Eurogamer has contacted GSC for comment on the video currently being circulated.
</p><p>
As to why Stalker 2 is now being targeted by a disinformation campaign, that's likely down to the game having become something a symbol of Ukranian resilience during Russian's invasion of the country (development has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stalker-2-documentary-shares-personal-stories-from-development-against-the-backdrop-of-war">continued throughout the Russian bombardment</a>, with some developers remaining in Kyiv while others have relocated to Prague), coupled with its recent high-profile - and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyl-has-sold-1-million-copies-so-far">enormously successful</a> - launch across Xbox Series X/S and PC.
</p>
<p>
Stalker 2's website was previously <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ukrainian-developer-stalker-2s-website-blocked-by-russia">blocked by the Russian government</a> after GSC posted a message calling for an end to its brutal invasion of Ukraine, and the studio has also been targeted by Russian hackers who <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stalker-2-studio-defiant-in-response-to-claimed-russian-hack">stole Stalker 2 development material</a> and threatened it with blackmail. "We are a Ukrainian company," GSC wrote at the time, "and like most Ukrainians, we have experienced many things that are much more terrifying: destroyed houses, ruined lives, and the deaths of our loved ones. Attempts to blackmail or intimidate us are completely futile".
</p>
<p>
Stalker 2 received a solid critical reception when it launched last week, despite its significant technical issues - Eurogamer called it a "compelling and often busted survival shooter that frustrates and satisfies at alternating pitch" in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyl-review">our three star review</a>. Since then, GSC has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyl-dev-acknowledges-rough-edges-says-its-monitoring-feedback">pledged to fix the game's "rough edges"</a>, starting with a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyls-first-patch-is-here-featuring-over-650-fixes">patch addressing over 650 issues</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/2/24311337/roblox-robux-app-store-fees-worth-more-party<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Roblox is now incentivizing users to buy its in-game currency, Robux, on platforms that won’t take app store fees. You can now get up to 25 percent more Robux if you purchase the currency through gift cards, on your computer, or on the web, <a href="https://devforum.roblox.com/t/users-can-enjoy-up-to-25-more-robux-on-computer-web-and-gift-cards/3275270">according to a developer forum post</a> from last week.</p><p>As for how that might look in practice, here’s some examples from the post:</p><div><blockquote><p>For example, users who purchase US $9.99 worth of Robux with a gift card, computer, or web would have originally received 800 Robux but will now receive 200 extra Robux or a total of 1000 Robux to spend on passes, in-experience items, and avatar items. Users who purchase a $10 gift card may now receive up to 1000 Robux when previously they would have received 800 Robux.</p></blockquote></div><div><figcaption><em>Roblox’s </em><a href="https://www.roblox.com/upgrades/robux"><em>Robux purchase page</em></a><em> also shows the additional Robux you’ll get by buying on your computer or the web.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Roblox</cite></p></div><p>Roblox says this isn’t a holiday promotion. “We plan to keep this new pricing in place globally beyond the holiday season,” according to an FAQ in the post. And if you redeem a gift card on a computer or on the web that purchased before the change was announced, you’ll get the higher amount of Robux, too.</p><p>The company gave a very vague answer its own FAQ about why the change only applies to Robux purchased via gift cards, computer, and web:</p><div><blockquote><p><strong>Why is the new pricing only available for gift cards and on computer and web?</strong></p><p>We’re always looking for opportunities to share more with our community, on all platforms and we’ll keep you updated on channels where the opportunity becomes available.</p></blockquote></div><p>But it seems likely that Roblox wants users to buy Robux through those channels to avoid losing money to fees taken by app stores and game console stores. And Roblox isn’t the only company to do something like this; YouTube Premium <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/28/24166546/subscribing-to-stuff-from-your-iphone-is-a-waste-of-money">costs more</a> when you subscribe via the iOS app, for example.</p><p>Today, Roblox also announced its <a href="https://corp.roblox.com/newsroom/2024/12/join-the-party-on-roblox">new Party tool</a> to help users more easily hang out and communicate on the platform. Up to six people can be in a Party, though they only support text chat to start — voice chat will arrive in “the coming months.”</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
