<p>Could an upgrade be on the way?</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure data-uuid="669da210f13f6"><a title="Pikmin 3 Deluxe" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/669da210f13f6/pikmin-3-deluxe.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Since the Switch 2 generation got underway, many Nintendo fans have been hoping for the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/pikmin">Pikmin</a> titles to receive a next-generation upgrade. Now, in an interesting development, a Switch 2 rating has surfaced on the European age rating board PEGI for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pikmin_3_deluxe">Pikmin 3 Deluxe</a>.</p>
<p>This rating was apparently filed by 'Nintendo of Europe SE' on 28th December 2025 (<a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2025/12/pikmin-3-deluxe-rated-for-switch-2-in-europe">thanks, Gematsu</a>). It's 'PEGI 3' (the same classification as the Switch game listed), contains "occasional, very mild violence in a comical or abstract context" and is suitable for all ages.</p>
<p>The same brief outline of the game is also attached to this rating, but no other significant details have been shared.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"In Pikmin 3 Deluxe, players take command of three explorers and a legion of adorable Pikmin in a fight for survival. By employing the unique abilities of these tiny Pikmin creatures, players will solve puzzles, battle dangerous predators and recover food needed to save the explorers' depleted home planet."</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pikmin_3_deluxe">Pikmin 3 Deluxe</a> made its debut in 2020 and follows the original Wii U entry from 2013. The Switch version of the game received a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/pikmin-3-deluxes-new-update-fixes-screen-flicker-issue-when-playing-on-switch-2">small update in June of this year</a>, improving the gameplay experience on Switch 2, but there has been no upgrade for the title so far. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pikmin_4">Pikmin 4</a> also received a free content update in November, adding new content and new modes.</p>
<p>Nintendo has previously released free and paid Switch 2 upgrades for existing Switch titles. This included <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/12-free-switch-2-game-upgrades-are-now-live-here-are-the-full-patch-notes">12 free Switch game updates</a> when the new hybrid system launched in June.</p>

            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/12/28/konami-want-to-release-one-silent-hill-game-every-year/</link>
            <guid>1393495</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Konami’s Motoi Okamoto, producer of the Silent Hill franchise, has said that the company hopes to release a Silent Hill game every year.</p>
<p>“Following the release of&nbsp;Silent Hill 2&nbsp;in October 2024, we were able to deliverSilent Hill f &nbsp;​​in September 2025, and the Silent Hill series is now back on track,” said Okamoto (via Google Translate). “We aim to release about one title per year, including both announced and unannounced titles. We’re not sure how far we can achieve this, but we’ll do our best as the producer of the Silent Hill series. Ideally, we’d like to keep the buzz around Silent Hill constant. We’ll do our best to provide you with new updates, so we hope you’ll wait a little longer.”</p>


<p>The announced games are <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/10/19/silent-hill-townfall-is-in-development-by-no-code/">Silent Hill Townfall,</a> which is in development at No Code, and a remake of the original Silent Hill by Bloober Team is also in the works. There’s also the new Silent Hill film that was meant to be out in 2025, but that seems rather unlikely now.&nbsp; Bloober Team announced the remake of the first Silent Hill game in June 2025 and at the time said they had been working on for three years. Quite why Konami remade <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/14/silent-hill-2-2024-review/">Silent Hill 2</a> first is a bit odd, but they must have had their reasons.</p>
<p>It seems that Konami are going to farm out the Silent Hill IP to different development teams to create games, so they may not all be in the classic Silent Hill mould.</p>

<p>Nick loved Silent Hill f and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/09/22/silent-hill-f-review/">gave it 10/10 in his review.</a> “Silent Hill f isn’t just a return to form, it’s a landmark entry in the series. Konami. NeoBards and Ryukishi07 have knocked it out of the park. For me, this isn’t just Game of the Year material, it’s an integral piece of Silent Hill history.”</p>

            <guid>1393480</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>The servers for Rainbow Six Siege X have been offline for over twenty-four hours after hackers managed to get into the hardware, gifting billions of in-game currency and unbanning players.&nbsp; The<a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/game/rainbow-six/siege/status"> official Rainbow Six Siege&nbsp; server status page</a> is rather coyly calling this an “unplanned outage”.</p>
<p>The issues began late on the 26th December when players started noticing billions of currency, known as Renown, dropping into their accounts. Ubisoft’s anti-cheat software then started suspending accounts. Others found strange messages appearing on the side of the screen, or super-rare skins in their inventory.</p>



<p>Ubisoft have shut down all servers for all platforms and have posted a couple of updates. Firstly they say that no one will be banned if they managed to spend any of the credits they received, but a rollback of accounts is in progress to remove the pirate treasure.&nbsp; They also say the ban ticker that was turned off in an old update had been reinstated, but will now be removed again, and “an official R6 ShieldGuard ban wave did occur, but it is not related to this incident.”</p>
<p>“A rollback is currently ongoing and afterwards, extensive quality control tests will be executed to ensure the integrity of accounts and effectiveness of changes,”&nbsp;posted Ubisoft on X&nbsp; “The team is focused on getting players back into the game as quickly as possible. Please know that this matter is being handled with extreme care and therefore, timing cannot be guaranteed. We will provide another update as soon as we know more.”</p>

<p>Ubisoft overhauled the decade-old tactical shooter in <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/03/13/rainbow-six-siege-x-is-going-free-to-play-and-brings-big-tech-improvements/">June of this year</a>, renaming it Rainbow Six Siege X, and added a whole host of technical improvements, as well as transitioning the game to a&nbsp;free-to-play model.</p>
<p>Rainbow Six is also one of three games<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/03/27/ubisoft-and-tencent-create-new-subsidiary-just-for-assassins-creed-rainbow-six-far-cry/"> hived off to a separate Ubisoft company,</a> along with Assassin’s Creed and Far Cry.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Ubisoft Hack is Reportedly ‘Blown Way Out of Proportion’, Say Sources]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-hack-false/</link>
            <guid>1393474</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>A recent slew of claims about a series of hacks and breaches at Ubisoft have been blown way out of proportion, according to people familiar with the events that have unfolded over the past couple of days.</p>







<p>Various rumours and claims of a Ubisoft breach began after the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/rainbow-six-siege-hack-servers-shut-down-ubisoft/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">company shut down Rainbow Six Siege servers</a> following a hacker who gifted players a combined $339,960,000,000,000 in in-game currency. According to sources familiar with the breach, Ubisoft intends to perform a rollback to undo this change.</p>



<h2 id="h-multiple-breaches-at-ubisoft">Multiple Breaches at Ubisoft</h2>



<p>However, the Rainbow Six Siege breach wasn’t the only hack that Ubisoft suffered. According to other groups of hackers (and has subsequently been circulating online), Ubisoft suffered a massive breach with some 900GB of data compromised. Allegedly, the data included source code, internal tools, and development materials of Ubisoft’s upcoming and previous games.</p>



<p>It now seems that these claims were, in fact, untrue. The group with such claims haven’t been able to provide any evidence of the alleged breach.</p>



<p>Sources within Ubisoft have told Insider Gaming that the company’s security team have been made aware of some breaches earlier this year following leaks surrounding projects such as <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-multiplayer-shooter-project-scout-rumor-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">‘Scout’</a> and the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/far-cry-7-leaks-online/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">since-cancelled Far Cry game</a> codenamed ‘Talisker’.</p>



<p>Another group that claimed to have breached user information has since backtracked, saying that it was false.</p>



<p>According to sources familiar with some of the groups who alleged such breaches, they say that the hacks were “blown way out of proportion” and some individuals “just wanted clout” from the hack that made headlines.</p>







<p>Insider Gaming has reached out to Ubisoft for comment, but has not received a response due to the holidays. Should we receive one, we will update this report.</p>

                <p>Epic has spent the past few years trying as hard as it can to will the Fortnite metaverse into being--and now, at the end of 2025, it's actually starting to look like it's getting there. Things are still very messy, but Epic's moves in that direction--which frequently seem to involve trying random things just to see what happens--may have finally borne fruit.</p><p dir="ltr">Back at the end of 2023, Fortnite attempted to usher in its metaverse in earnest by launching Fortnite Festival, Rocket Racing, and Lego Fortnite all at once. It didn't quite work, because all three were half-baked and missing key features. The only way to play Racing was in Ranked, Festival lacked instrument support and still doesn't have a practice mode, and Lego Fortnite had the feel of a generic early-access survival game wearing Lego clothing.</p><p dir="ltr">Two years later, we've got a much prettier picture, but not because Epic went all in on those modes. Instead, Epic has simply kept churning out new modes, some of which have done consistently. Likewise, Fortnite Creative has produced its first blockbuster map with any staying power. Thanks to some key legal victories, Fortnite is once again available on mobile devices in most places, which has dramatically increased the game's potential footprint. And the new cosmetic types added in the past year have proven a lot more popular than the cars and musical instruments that were introduced in Chapter 5.</p><p dir="ltr">A lot happened in Fortnite during the past year. To make it all a little easier to digest, let's go through the biggest developments one by one.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4625135-brainrottttt.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4625135" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4625135-brainrottttt.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4625135"></a><figcaption>Brainrot is taking over Fortnite.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4625135-brainrottttt.jpg"></figure><h2 dir="ltr">Rise of the Brainrots</h2><p dir="ltr">The Creative part of Fortnite got its first genuine blockbuster in 2025 with Steal the Brainrot, a licensed clone of one of Roblox's most popular modes. Steal the Brainrot was an instant success in Fortnite, and it consistently averages enough concurrent players that it can compete with Epic's battle royale modes. Now, Epic is planning to capitalize on Brainrot's success by allowing creators using the Unreal Editor for Fortnite to add <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fortnite-creative-may-be-going-pay-to-win-soon/1100-6536230/" data-ref-id="1100-6536230">V-Bucks transactions to their islands</a>, something the Roblox version of the Brainrot game has that Fortnite's currently does not.</p><p dir="ltr">Unfortunately, the success of this mode means Epic has decided to use it as a focus in its marketing for Fortnite as a whole, as well as promoting it generally by placing it in the in-game news feed. That's proven to be incredibly off-putting for folks who aren't interested in that mode--which is pretty much everyone who doesn't already play it.</p><p dir="ltr">With the Brainrots apparently here to stay, there's reason to worry that Fortnite might soon be flooded with this sort of goofy nonsense aimed entirely at children. Epic has already made it unnecessarily difficult for folks who just want to play BR to sift through all the Creative islands and other modes they don't care about in Fortnite's messy Discover tab.</p><p dir="ltr">The problem is that Fortnite does not offer any way to tailor your Discover tab at all except favoriting modes and maps that you like. You can't, for example, tell it that you're not interested in Steal the Brainrot, so there's no way to escape the noise or pretend it doesn't exist because Epic is constantly promoting it to you. It's not fun.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4625136-fortniteogwherewedroppin.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4625136" data-ratio="0.5" data-width="2048" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4625136-fortniteogwherewedroppin.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4625136"></a><figcaption>Fortnite OG, Reload, Blitz, and Delulu are all here to stay, apparently.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4625136-fortniteogwherewedroppin.jpg"></figure><h2 dir="ltr">The fracturing of battle royale</h2><p dir="ltr">Fortnite added several new battle royale spinoff modes in the past year, starting with the permanent OG mode that has been revisiting Chapter 1. In addition to more or less recreating the game as it existed seven years ago, this mode even got its own new battle pass, the OG pass, for each of its seasons.</p><p dir="ltr">Then we had Blitz Royale, which arrived during the summer with a focus on mobile players, thanks to its short matches on a small island. Epic has done tons of fine-tuning on Blitz Royale since it launched, trying all sorts of novel mechanics, like granting all players a super-powered medallion to start a match--though since the beginning of November, Blitz is more like a tiny version of standard Battle Royale, without as many gimmicks. But Blitz has changed so frequently that it's never had a real status quo--which is a great way to keep players' interest.</p><p dir="ltr">Epic followed that up with Delulu, a weekends-only mode with proximity voice chat that allows players to form impromptu teams--and then betray each other if they want to.</p><p dir="ltr">Somehow, these new modes--alongside Reload, OG, and regular Battle Royale--have all managed to maintain healthy populations at the same time. They absolutely do cannibalize each other a bit, but not so much that it affects matchmaking in any particular mode for most folks. It's tough to imagine that Epic could get away with any more new BR modes without a bump to Fortnite's overall population, but Epic clearly knows this too--that's probably why Delulu is only available on the weekends.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4625137-fortnitedaftpunkkk.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4625137" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4625137-fortnitedaftpunkkk.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4625137"></a><figcaption>Fortnite got really into releasing new music skins this year.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4625137-fortnitedaftpunkkk.jpg"></figure><h2 dir="ltr">Going all in on celebs</h2><p dir="ltr">Being a rhythm game, Fortnite Festival was never going to pull hundreds of thousands of concurrent users over the long term in the way Battle Royale does. These days, the mode has a small but dedicated playerbase, but the cosmetics associated with the mode--skins of pop stars in the item shop and the seasonal music passes--have clearly been a big success for Epic, because the company has been doing a lot more of those types of collabs in general this year.</p><p dir="ltr">Just in the past few months, Fortnite has introduced new collaborations with five musical artists (Deadmau5, Daft Punk, Doja Cat, Tyler the Creator, and Playboi Carti) that were not Festival headliners, and then Epic punctuated its newly ramped-up celeb obsession by adding <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/kim-kardashian-is-coming-to-fortnite-this-week/1100-6536858/" data-ref-id="1100-6536858">Kim Kardashian</a> in December. Considering how popular these celebrity and popstar skins have been lately--it feels like we've been battling Sabrina Carpenters nonstop in BR this year--you can probably expect even more crossovers of this type in 2026.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4625140-fortniteptets2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4625140" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4625140-fortniteptets2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4625140"></a><figcaption>Fortnite will sell you in-game pets now.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4625140-fortniteptets2.jpg"></figure><h2 dir="ltr">New virtual toys to spend money on</h2><p dir="ltr">Epic Games has been gradually introducing new types of cosmetics over the last couple of years. Back in Chapter 5, it added cars, musical instruments, and various Lego things. Kicks popped up just before the start of Chapter 6 a year ago, and in 2025, we got sidekicks--essentially pets who follow us around and get excited when we perform certain in-game actions. While the new Chapter 5 cosmetics struggled so much out of the gate that Epic had to lower some of their prices--it turned out that 4,000 V-Bucks was kind of a lot for a Fortnite car--kicks seem to have done well, and sidekicks are a definite hit.</p><p dir="ltr">Yes, there's been plenty of grumbling about both of the most recently added new cosmetic types--folks who aren't sneakerheads tend to scoff at kicks, and there was a lot of frustration that you can only customize your sidekick's appearance once before it locks permanently. But folks are buying them nonetheless. It's rare that I have a teammate who doesn't have a pet dog or cat (or chicken) following them around.</p><p dir="ltr">And speaking personally, as somebody who's been playing for years and has tons of skins, I like being able to branch out with new stuff. I really don't need more skins at this point, but having Itchy from The Simpsons follow me around and celebrate my kills is delightful.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4625141-darth-vader-fortnite-1920x1080-95ea0f1d91f3%281%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4625141" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4625141-darth-vader-fortnite-1920x1080-95ea0f1d91f3%281%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4625141"></a><figcaption>Fortnite let us have some uncanny conversations with Darth Vader in May.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4625141-darth-vader-fortnite-1920x1080-95ea0f1d91f3%281%29.jpg"></figure><h2 dir="ltr">The AI slop is coming?</h2><p dir="ltr">While Fortnite is not currently any sort of wasteland of AI nonsense, the first red flags popped up this year. Epic's most notable AI-driven creation was the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/where-to-find-ai-darth-vader-in-fortnite/1100-6531612/" data-ref-id="1100-6531612">Darth Vader NPC in Battle Royale</a> during the Star Wars mini-season in May, who could respond dynamically, in the voice of the late James Earl Jones, to things players said to him. It was definitely weird, but at least it was something that might have been impractical to try <em>without</em> AI.</p><p dir="ltr">Other apparent AI things have begun popping up here and there within Fortnite since then. Epic gave out a free jam track in October that had <a href="https://fortnite.gg/cosmetics?id=20816" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">AI-generated cover art featuring Hatsune Miku</a>--even though the track had nothing to do with Miku. There are some pieces of art in the game in Chapter 7 that have commonly been accused of being AI-generated, like a poster of a Yeti in a hammock in which <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/1pahvnv/is_this_chapter_7_art_ai_generated/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">one of his feet has five toes while the other has four</a>. And <a href="https://fortnite.gg/cosmetics?id=20956" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">an emote</a> on Lisa's music pass uses a licensed 2025 song so obscure that nobody even knows who made it--and it sounds very much like it's AI-generated. Oh, and those Brainrots? All of those are AI-generated meme designs from the <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/danidiplacido/2025/09/19/robloxs-italian-brainrot-trend-explained/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Italian Brainrot trend</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">To be honest, all of that really doesn't add up to very much. But when you take those things alongside <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ai-disclosures-make-no-sense-for-game-stores-tim-sweeney-says/1100-6536526/" data-ref-id="1100-6536526">recent comments from Epic CEO Tim Sweeney</a>--in which he said it's absurd for Steam to require disclosure if AI-generated content is used in a game's development because AI will soon be involved in all dev work--there's certainly some reason to worry that Epic might be planning to unleash the slop in its never-ending pursuit of the children who play Roblox.</p>

<p>Nintendo Switch Online is the premium subscription service available for Switch and Switch 2 users to try. Unlike PlayStation’s PS Plus and Xbox’s Game Pass, which provide access to a library of current-gen and previous-gen games, NSO gives players access to a range of classic games from previous Nintendo platforms.</p>



<p>If you combine Nintendo Switch Online with the Expansion Pack, then players can get access to a library of games from almost all classic Nintendo consoles, including NES, SNES, Game Boy, Nintendo 64, Game Boy Advance, SEGA Genesis, and Nintendo GameCube games. </p>



<p>In 2025, NSO members had access to some top-tier classic games through Nintendo Switch Online, including hits from popular franchises like Zelda, Mario, and more. Check out Insider Gaming’s top 10 picks of Nintendo Switch Online games that you need to try out in 2025:</p>



<h2 id="h-the-legend-of-zelda-ocarina-of-time">The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>If you are a Nintendo Switch Online user in 2025 and haven’t played The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time, then you are missing out. What’s more, it is the highest-rated game of all time on Metacritic. Do you need any more convincing after that? It was the first 3D Legend of Zelda game, making Hyrule more alive than ever before thanks to environmental storytelling, a good mix of exploration, puzzles, and combat, and memorable characters. </p>



<h2 id="h-super-metroid">Super Metroid</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>Super Metroid is a 1994 SNES game that was the third installment in the series. It saw Samus Aran face off against Space Pirates in her quest to recover the last Metroid. Super Metroid is a fantastic 2D side-scrolling action adventure, where you explore large areas while being able to run, jump, crouch, and fire in different directions. The game also features other types of power-ups that can enhance Samus’ arsenal or grant special abilities. </p>



<h2 id="h-the-legend-of-zelda-windwaker">The Legend of Zelda: Windwaker</h2>

<p>Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion members received the original GameCube version of The Legend of Windwaker for the Switch 2 in 2025. Wind Waker was released in 2002 and brought a significant change to the series, with the developers exploring a brand-new art style. Additionally, the game also had Link visiting clusters of islands across the Great Sea, where he used a sailboat called King of Red Lions to navigate through</p>

<figure></figure>



<p>Super Mario World is another classic hit that Nintendo Switch Online players shouldn’t miss out on in 2025. The title was released in 1991 for the SNES and quickly became a fan favorite. Though most of it was similar to the series, the game came with a new gameplay feature that would become iconic to the series. The feature in question is Yoshi, the rideable dinosaur who could walk faster, eat enemies, and spit them like projectiles. Super Mario World is also the best-selling SNES game. </p>



<h2 id="h-f-zero-gx">F-Zero GX</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>F-Zero is a classic racing game set in a futuristic world. The game is similar to previous titles in the F-Zero series; however, what makes it unique is the introduction of a story mode where players can complete 9 chapters as Captain Falcon. The game features a variety of tracks with tubes, jumps, and roller coaster-like paths. There are also a variety of machines in the game, each behaving differently. </p>



<h2 id="h-fire-emblem-the-sacred-stones">Fire Emblem: The Sacred Stones</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>Fire Emblem: The Sacred Stones is an installment that is separate from the continuity of other games. It is set in the fictional continent of Magvel, where two royal siblings fight to keep hostile sources from invading their kingdom. The title is a tactical RPG featuring turn-based combat, with players battling allied, player-controlled, and enemy units. Each unit has the ability to evolve through experience points; however, it also features a perma-death system, where if a unit dies, it can’t return for the rest of the campaign unless the player restarts the game. </p>



<h2 id="h-goldeneye-007">GoldenEye 007</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>If you have ever been a fan of the James Bond series and wish to try a classic FPS title, then you can’t go wrong with GoldenEye 007. It is based on the 1995 film, in which you play the iconic MI6 agent James Bond, facing a criminal syndicate that plans to deploy a satellite weapon. The game was originally going to be a side-scroller for the SNES, but ended up becoming a first-person shooter inspired by games like Doom, released for the Nintendo 64, and became the third-best-selling game on the platform.</p>



<h2 id="h-rayman-2-the-great-escape">Rayman 2: The Great Escape</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>Rayman 2: The Great Escape was a special installment in the series, as it marked the move from 2D to 3D. Just like others, it is a platformer released for the Nintendo 64 in 1999, where players run through linear sequences, battle robotic pirates, collect lums, and solve puzzles. The primary weapon in the game is Rayman’s fists, and as you progress, the game gives you more abilities with charged attacks, ranged attacks, and more traversal methods being added to the player’s arsenal.</p>



<h2 id="h-golden-sun">Golden Sun</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>Golden Sun is a fantasy RPG that was released for the Game Boy Advance in 2001, and it eventually received two more installments over the years. The game has you playing four characters as you embark on a quest to protect the world from a destructive force called Alchemy. The title features several interesting characters to interact with, monsters to fight, and new abilities and equipment to acquire. </p>



<h2 id="h-mario-kart-64">Mario Kart 64</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>Mario Kart 64 is a cart-racing game and the second installment in the series. It was released for the Nintendo 64 in 1996 and eventually became the second-best-selling game on the platform. The gameplay is broadly similar to other games in the series, where you choose one of 8 Mario franchise characters to race across the game’s 20 courses inspired by areas in Super Mario games. Players also get special abilities and power-ups that are unique to the Super Mario series. </p>

The Power Glove was ambitious, impressive, even important — one of the very first mainstream devices that let you control a game using your body instead of just your thumbs — but it was not good. In some ways, its not-good-ness is a key part of the story.</p><p>The Power Glove showed up in the late 1980s, at a complicated time for the gaming industry, when Nintendo was a hugely powerful force for the future of fun. But the Power Glove wasn’t really even a Nintendo product. It started as a research lark, became a toy, and only wound up with Nintendo’s name on it after a particularly fateful pitch meeting. Thanks to a remarkable marketing campaign, and the feeling that VR often gives of simply being <em>the future</em>, the Power Glove wound up a reasonable (if brief) business success. And you can draw a line from the Glove to some other hugely successful Nintendo products — and maybe even to the whole VR industry as we know it.</p><p>On <a href="https://pod.link/1840983742">this episode of <em>Version History</em></a>, our chat show about old technology, we dig into the story of the Power Glove. It is, somehow, both very brief and very long. David Pierce, <em><a href="http://www.fandom.com/">Fandom’</a></em>s Chris Grant, and <em><a href="https://www.gamefile.news/">Game File</a></em>’s Stephen Totilo explore the projects that led to the Power Glove, the many (<em>many) </em>reasons it wasn’t a very good product, and the ways in which it changed the future anyway. They also attempt to set up a decades-old Glove and play games with it, which goes… poorly.</p><p>If you want to subscribe to <em>Version History, </em>there are two ways to get every episode as soon as it drops:</p><p>And if you want to know more about the Power Glove, whether you got to try it or not, here are some links to get you started:</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6Mjc0"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>David Pierce</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/podcast/850556/nintendo-power-glove-version-history]]></content:encoded>

<figure data-uuid="67052f9093ea2"><a title="The Hundred Line 1" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/67052f9093ea2/the-hundred-line-1.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo Life / Aniplex / XSEED Games</em></figcaption></figure><p><em>Over the holiday season, we're republishing some of the best articles from Nintendo Life writers and contributors from</em> <em><a data-sk="tooltip_parent" data-stringify-link="https://www.nintendolife.com/tags/best-of-2025" href="https://www.nintendolife.com/tags/best-of-2025">2025</a></em><em>. This article was originally published in May. Enjoy!</em></p>
<hr>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Warning:</strong> This article delves into spoiler territory for The Hundred Line - Last Defense Academy. If you've yet to play the game and want to go in blind, we recommend you come back at another time...</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I’m not a fan of tactical RPGs… is what I would have told you before I played <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/hundred_line_-_last_defense_academy">The Hundred Line - Last Defense Academy</a>. Heck, I’m still not sure I would call myself a 'fan' of the genre, necessarily; one game perhaps isn’t enough to sway me <em>that</em> much. The Hundred Line, though..? Yeah, I’m a fan of The Hundred Line.</p>
<p>In fact, it's easily my Game of the Year so far, and even with the Switch 2 on the horizon, it’s going to take something truly special to usurp its throne. Mitch gave it an 'Excellent' <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch/the-hundred-line-last-defense-academy">9/10 in our review</a>, but what he didn’t cover – what he <em>couldn’t</em> cover without spoiling anything – is just how ridiculously ambitious Too Kyo Games’ visual novel / tactical RPG hybrid really is.</p>
<p>So, if you’re sensitive about spoilers and want to go into this one completely fresh, consider this your last warning. We’re going in, folks.</p>

<p>Before I waltz headfirst into what is undoubtedly The Big Twist™, I want to first look at the wonderful cast of characters. Much like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/danganronpa_decadence">Danganronpa</a> before it, the entire premise of The Hundred Line — survive and protect your school against invaders over the course of one hundred days — would have crashed and burned were it not for the likes of Takumi Sumino, Darumi Amemiya, Shouma Ginzaki, Nozomi Kirifuji, and the rest of those loveable goofballs.</p>
<p>Character work is truly where directors Kazutaka Kodaka and Kotaro Uchikoshi shine brightest. They managed to make every member of the 'Special Defense Unit' completely unique and special in their own way.</p>
<p>Take Tsubasa Kawana, for instance. Whenever she’s placed in a stressful situation, she immediately feels nauseous, and it makes for some wonderful comedic relief. I lost count of the number of times I giggled whenever the story took a dark turn, and the camera switched over to Tsubasa loudly dry heaving.</p>
<p>In addition to the comic relief, however, we also learn a lot about Tsubasa’s background, including her passion for machinery fostered by fixing cars with her grandfather as a child. We get similar deep dives into every character, to the point where we begin to understand the potential causes behind their various quirks. Even total prats like Ima Tsukumo, whose obsessive devotion to his ‘Dear Sister’ Kako proves deeply concerning, gets his own moment of redemption through both his backstory and the way the plot progresses.</p>
<p>By the time I reached the credits, I really didn’t want the game to end. I’d grown to love these characters, and a couple of significant losses actually brought a tear to my eye during the final stages; something that no game before it has accomplished. Couldn’t I just keep going? Just for a bit..?</p>
<p>Well, here’s the thing: it didn’t end.</p>
<p>When you reach the last couple of days in the basic hundred-day timeline, you learn that through powers gained via absorption of your enemies, protagonist Takumi can actually go back in time to day one and re-do the whole thing again. Only this time, you’re free to make significant changes to the story and work your way toward one of a potential hundred different endings. <em>Whoa</em> – hold my beer, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/nierautomata_the_end_of_yorha_edition">Nier Automata</a>!</p>
<figure data-uuid="c8e60d5045326"><a title="The Hundred Line 4" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/c8e60d5045326/the-hundred-line-4.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo Life / Aniplex / XSEED Games</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>I know what you’re probably thinking, and no, you don’t have to play through the <em>entire</em> game a hundred times. Effectively, the story can branch off into several different paths, each of which has a number of potential endings, and the game even gives you the ability to jump back to specific days in order to change your decisions and alter the story’s path.</p>
<p>Some endings may be exceedingly short, others a bit lengthier… some good, and some <em>very</em> bad. One might see you become the villain of the story, while another may conclude with the adorably loyal samurai Kyoshika Magadori being devoured by your zombified friends. The variety of avenues is simply absurd, and discovering each one is a joy.</p>
<p>These are just a couple of the more, shall we say, ‘insignificant’ possible endings. I won’t go into those which might actually spoil the overarching plot; even if you’re still with me at this point, I’d like you to enjoy The Hundred Line’s story on your own terms. It’s safe to say, however, that the run through those initial one hundred days could definitely be considered a ‘prologue’, even though it comfortably stands as a compelling story in its own right with a beginning, middle, and end.</p>

<p>So you can definitely stop there and have a grand ol’ time, but if you’re looking for something a bit more ambitious — something that throws the rulebook out of the window — I’d encourage you to keep going and see exactly what The Hundred Line has up its sleeve. It’s simply magnificent.</p>
<p>There are so many reasons why I love this game. I love figuring out what to do during ‘free time’ sessions in which you can either chat to your fellow students, venture out into the world in a board-game-inspired minigame of sorts, or dive straight into a few battle simulations to potentially upgrade your abilities.</p>
<p>The biggest surprise for me, however, was how much I loved the battle system itself. As I mentioned at the start, I’m normally not one for tactical RPGs, but The Hundred Line’s turn-based structure just works so well. I often get overwhelmed when it comes to deciding how to approach tactical gameplay: how do these characters function? Why can’t I move more than two spaces? Just what the heck do I <em>do</em>?</p>
<p>The Hundred Line made it easy, though, and it’s once again thanks to the remarkably unique and diverse cast. Their artistic design makes it easy to distinguish one from another, and it only took a couple of battles until I memorised their strengths and weaknesses, along with how their attacks play out on the field of battle. It got to the point where, after a handful of quiet days full of ‘free time’, the warbling alarm to signify an incoming battle filled me with excitement.</p>

<p>Most of the battles felt doable and I never felt completely helpless against the hordes of invaders, but there were still a few that I managed to botch straight away and lose within just a few minutes. In those instances, the game gives you the option to redo the battle with significant boosts to your manpower, instantly giving you 300% 'voltage' (which essentially gives you three uses of your extra-powerful special attacks) and refilling your squad's health. Is it cheating? Sure, I <em>guess</em>... But it also makes the game significantly more approachable for tactical newcomers like myself.</p>
<p>I adore the Danganronpa series. I think they’re wonderful games that remain just as compelling now as they were back when they first launched, and if it weren’t for Danganronpa, I don’t think The Hundred Line would even exist. I have to be honest with myself, though… The Hundred Line is better. It’s a masterpiece.</p>
<p>Co-director Kazutaka Kodaka has <a href="https://x.com/kazkodaka/status/1921370017678946504">recently confirmed</a> that the game is "selling well", but I still feel like not enough people are talking about it. I suspect, however, that as the years go by and more people play it through word of mouth, it’ll go down as one of the greatest visual novels of all time. There’s simply nothing else quite like it.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/sleeping-dogs-film-director-timo-tjahjanto-simu-liu/</link>
            <guid>1393381</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The upcoming live-action adaptation of Sleeping Dogs has found its director. As of now, the film is set to star Shang-Chi actor Simu Liu as Wei Shen with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sleeping-dogs-film-script-simu-liu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a script complete</a>.</p>



<p>Released in 2012, Sleeping Dogs has become quite the cult classic. Following an undercover Hong Kong police officer, players explore an open world with parkour abilities and martial arts. Despite earning positive reviews, low sales led to the series being dead in the water. </p>



<p>However, Hollywood has gotten its hands on it, now reinvigorated by MCU’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sleeping-dogs-adaptation-and-sequel-mentioned-by-simu-liu/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Shang-Chi actor Simu Liu</a>, who’ll star as protagonist Wei Shen. A script was revealed to be complete for the project earlier in the year, but it was unknown where it would lead. Now, an up-and-coming action film director is about to take on the long-awaited adaptation.</p>







<h2 id="h-timo-tjahjanto-to-direct-sleeping-dogs-starring-mcu-s-simu-liu">Timo Tjahjanto&nbsp;to Direct Sleeping Dogs, Starring MCU’s Simu Liu</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>In a post from <a href="https://x.com/SimuLiu/status/2005248803172135343" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Simu Liu</a> on Twitter, it has been confirmed that Timo Tjahjanto&nbsp;will direct Sleeping Dogs. The Indonesian director has&nbsp;done a few films but is just starting to get onto bigger projects. His latest movie, Nobody 2, was a worthy follow-up to the 2021 Bob Odenkirk action flick. He is also attached to direct the sequel to the Jason Statham-led project, The Beekeeper, and a possible Hollywood sequel to <a href="https://deadline.com/2021/02/new-lines-train-to-busan-timo-tjahjanto-1234696403/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Train to Busan</a>.</p>



<p>Interestingly enough, Timo Tjahjanto has been an advocate for Sleeping Dogs to hit the big screens for a while. In response to Simu Liu’s post on the game’s lack of movement anywhere, the director <a href="https://x.com/Timobros/status/1885391495785832519" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">explains its biggest problem</a> was a lack of understanding from executives. When asked about directing the film adaptation, he sent a smiling gif, which has aged incredibly well given today’s news.</p>



<p>The film has yet to acquire a studio or a release date. Still, with a director, writer, script, and Marvel actor at the forefront, it may not be long before one is revealed. Sleeping Dogs has been a work-in-progress in Hollywood, as previous attempts didn’t pan out. Legendary action star Donnie Yen (Rogue One, John Wick: Chapter 4), was attached to play Wei Shen, but it never came around. Hopefully, the film will see the light of day and Sleeping Dogs can get the love it deserves.</p>







<p>What do you think of the director of Sleeping Dogs? Think Timo Tjahjanto is a good pick? Seen any of his films? Do you think Sleeping Dogs will make for a good Hollywood film?

<figure data-uuid="91f8c5b23e954"><a title="A giant Bob-omb" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/91f8c5b23e954/a-giant-bob-omb.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p><em>Over the holiday season, we're republishing some of the best articles from Nintendo Life writers and contributors from</em> <em><a data-sk="tooltip_parent" data-stringify-link="https://www.nintendolife.com/tags/best-of-2025" href="https://www.nintendolife.com/tags/best-of-2025">2025</a></em><em>. This article was originally published in May.</em></p>
<p><em>We should note that the Giant Bomb story had a happy ending, with the staff buying GB from Fandom and going independent. Yes! Nevertheless, in another turbulent year for the games industry and the media covering it, it's more important than ever to support the work you love...</em></p>
<hr>
<p>Well, we've come to the end of a week that's seen the end of two gaming institutions as we've known them for many years.</p>
<p>The departure of <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/danryckert.com">Dan Ryckert</a> and <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/grubb.wtf">Jeff Grubb</a> from Giant Bomb <a href="https://kotaku.com/giant-bomb-fandom-dan-ryckert-jeff-grubb-gerstmann-1851778728">on Thursday</a> was swiftly followed by <a href="https://kotaku.com/polygon-sold-vox-media-valnet-layoffs-digital-gaming-1851778655">news of layoffs</a> at Polygon following the site's sale to Valnet (owner of Screen Rant). Seeing these top-tier creators and games journalists unceremoniously cast aside has been a shock for anybody who's followed and enjoyed their work over the years.</p>
<p>Except it hasn't really, has it? The layoffs in games and games media have become so commonplace that it doesn't come as a surprise anymore to see gaming institutions crumble around us - it's just another week in the industry.</p>
<p>We're a month away from a new Nintendo console launch — something we've been waiting for for so long — and yet many of the critic voices fans are most keen to hear have been de-platformed this week in circumstances that leave us, if not surprised, then thoroughly depressed and dumbfounded by the decisions taken by management at Fandom and Valnet.</p>

<p>Whether you've been an avid Giant Bomb fan since the original Gerstmann/Davis days, jumped on board in the mid-2010s, or are a more recent convert, the Giant Bombcast (and Beastcast for a good spell there) has been a fixture of many a gamer's week since starting in 2008, even if you never watched a single GB video. The podcast's radio-style warmth and informed-but-informal tone set the template for many a gaming podcast in the following years, and epic, multi-hour Game of the Year episodes became yearly traditions for listeners to look forward to and savour.</p>
<p><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/vinnycaravella.bsky.social">Vinny</a>, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/bradshoemaker.bsky.social">Brad</a>, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/alexnavarro.bsky.social">Alex</a>, and <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jeffgerstmann.com">Jeff</a>'s respective departures across 2021/22 might have felt like the last straws, but Fandom <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/giantbomb/comments/1kaziyh/giant_bombcast_888_thrive_from_neglect/?rdt=42262">pulling down episode #888</a> feels like the definitive end of an era.</p>
<p>Then there's Valnet's acquisition of Polygon and the subsequent layoffs. It feels like a tentpole of modern games media falling. For over 12 years, the site's writers have consistently put out some of the best articles in the space, so the talent being thrown away with this round of layoffs is confounding. Firing your most experienced staffers mere weeks before an important console launch suggests something about the standard of coverage these companies are interested in providing their audience, you might think.</p>

<p>If you're a fan of those voices (from Giant Bomb or Polygon, or any of the writers and creators who've suffered layoffs in recent times), remember that the vast majority are online, searchable, and — crucially — supportable. They may not be on the platform you've previously found them on for years, but they're almost certainly out there doing great work.</p>
<p>If you love that work and you're in a position to subscribe to their Patreon, fling them a few quid over Ko-Fi, or sign up as a supporter, please do so. Assuming that these sites and streams will just survive and their creators can simply jump ship to a similar gig when the iceberg looms is wishful thinking.</p>
<p>Willing but not in the financial position to send your hard-earned cash to a bunch of writers and podcasters and streamers? Hey, as anyone working in games media will tell you, it's tough out there - and there's no shortage of good causes in need of support these days. Remember, though, that just downloading and listening to podcasts on the free feeds, watching streams, and turning off adblockers on sites (like this one, for instance!) makes a big difference.</p>

<p>Our hearts go out to everyone at GB and Polygon affected this week. If you've ever enjoyed their work — or if you've never heard of them and you're wondering what all the fuss is about — seek them out and, if you're able, support them in their other endeavours, old and new.</p>
<p>And remember to be liberal with praise and support of the sites you love, and their creators.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/hollow-knight-silksong-insider-gaming-community-2025-indie-game-of-the-year/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Indie games don’t all fit into the same box anymore. Some are made by small teams taking big creative swings, while others come from well-funded studios operating outside the traditional AAA system. What ties them together isn’t budget, but identity—games built around a clear vision, willing to do things differently, and often unafraid to take risks.</p>



<p>That range was on full display in the Insider Gaming community’s Indie Game of the Year poll, which featured everything from long-awaited sequels to experimental standouts. And when the votes were counted, one title ultimately rose to the top as Hollow Knight: Silksong was voted as the 2025 Indie Game of the Year.</p>







<p>The long-awaited sequel finished first with 21.7% of the vote, just beating out Clair Obscur: Expedition 33’s and Dispatch’s 18.9%. Other games in the running were Ball x Pit (8.5%), Peak (7.5%), Hades 2 (7.5%), Absolum (6.6%), Blue Prince (5.7%), and Schedule I (4.7%). </p>



<p>What makes Silksong’s win stand out is the anticipation for it seemingly paid off upon release, with the game receiving acclaim from players far and wide. But in the end, the results reflect what makes the indie scene so compelling. There’s no single formula for success, only games that connect with players in different ways. This year, the Insider Gaming community made it clear that Hollow Knight: Silksong stood just a bit taller than the rest.</p>

            <link>https://www.nintendolife.com/features/opinion-i-finally-finished-ring-fit-adventure-and-it-might-be-peak-nintendo</link>
            <guid>1393285</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
<figure data-uuid="53414771838c6"><a title="Ring Fit Adventure" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/53414771838c6/ring-fit-adventure.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Omar Hafeez-Bore / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>I must have some kind of record for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/ring_fit_adventure">Ring Fit</a>, if not internationally (see: <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/players-are-pushing-their-bodies-to-the-limit-speedrunning-nintendos-fitness-game/">here</a>), then at least for the West Midlands. I played 10 hours over the weekend, which probably sounds like a lot. I can confirm it was.</p>
<p>You know those charity fundraisers of dancing for 24 hours or whatever? It wasn't that. All I raised was my knees (a lot), the Ring (nearly as much), and my cat towards the ring to try and get it to jump through (once, he didn't).</p>
<p>But I fancied an excuse to finally dust off my file and finish it before 2025 was up, and so pitched this article and then realised last week just how <em>much</em> adventure there was still left to be had.</p>
<p>It’s been genuinely brilliant, a great game and a gorgeous vibe to engage with and inhabit for a bit. Here's some notes, only <em>some</em> of which can be attributed to the Stockholm Syndrome of largely running on the spot for six hours:</p>
<h2><strong>1) Ring Fit is one of Nintendo's most beautiful games ever</strong></h2>

<p>I am not just dehydrated and delirious, and yes, I <em>have</em> played <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Breath of the Wild</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/super_mario_world_2_yoshis_island">Yoshi’s Island</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/super_metroid">Super Metroid</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> (I love Mario Kart World).</p>
<p>But Ring Fit’s colour is something else, verdant fields of wind-rippled grass with peach-pink pom pom trees, azure rivers, and dandelion showers with every ring squeeze. Sometimes a level is gilded in sunset gold, sometimes thick with mist. And all this with a sort of robust, pastel creaminess - like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/legend_of_zelda_skyward_sword_hd">Skyward Sword</a> set to Vivid.</p>
<p>I’m not sure if it’s just the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bokeh">bokeh</a> or also the field of view or something that gives it such an open-air sense of stretching scope, but I know that just loading it up feels like adventure.</p>
<h2><strong>2) Its linearity is brilliant and the jump is brilliant-er</strong></h2>
<figure data-uuid="d87b2ea902df5"><a title="Ring Fit Adventure" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/d87b2ea902df5/ring-fit-adventure.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Omar Hafeez-Bore / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>No one wants to go to the gym with that blank-page vagueness of what to work out today, pootling around the machines and then just deciding to do another ‘whole body’ session that starts with press-ups again. Clear direction is movement is progress. And in Ring Fit there’s always a direction, and that direction is forward.</p>
<p>Sure, there is a bit of back-tracking for items and some branching world routes, but nothing to bend the vector of <em>onward</em>. And each level is gloriously on-rails, the landscape expansive but the path laid out, with enough analogue interactivity in the moving and jumping to add swing in the tempo.</p>
<p>But it’s also a bit Sonic with its upper/lower level tiers, and suddenly seeing a gap in the bridge and hastily puffing the Ring-Con just so to get enough thruster-boost to casually flip across is so gratifying, I’d add it to the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/jump-man-a-celebration-of-the-greatest-jumps-in-gaming">best video game jumps</a>.</p>

<h2><strong>3) The writing is classic understated Nintendo</strong></h2>
<figure data-uuid="8bc7e9a0c1416"><a title="Ring Fit Adventure" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/8bc7e9a0c1416/ring-fit-adventure.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Omar Hafeez-Bore / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>For an RPG it’s quite Ring Thrifty, focusing mainly on modelling enemies and boss-baddies and the charming couple who work in the shop (big fan of the wife’s criss-cross tights being made of tape measure).</p>
<p>The rest of the interactions are via low-stakes text window drama with NPCs drawn in that unique angular way. But within this you get a Robot World in which people speak in Binary (‘WANWANOH’), a sub-plot about a cyborg girl with literally Steel-y Buns and all sorts of other exchanges that don’t really add any real drama, but accent the whole game in lovely upbeat charm.</p>
<h2><strong>4)</strong> <strong><em>My sweat is so shiny and beautiful!</em></strong></h2>

<p>I know this because my (female-voiced, actually kind of endearing) Ring would say it at the end of some levels, which was quite uncanny. I am well known for my shiny sweat, after all.</p>
<p>But if you go straight downstairs without slapping on the roll-on before a marathon session you <em>may</em> start to get that acrid tang of old sweat, occasionally inducing a bin-juice wince. It was at about four hours in that I dreaded my own arm lifts.</p>
<h2><strong>5) Losing calories is gaining something else</strong></h2>

<p>People play games for different things, but I am particularly partial to movement. There is so much joy to be had in the compression of motion to fingers and thumbs, detaching it from actual body work to use it like a colour in a designer's palette.</p>
<p>And yet even when burning calories by playing Ring Fit, there was something wholesome in the exertion, something evolutionary endorphinous (this is not a word) and replenishing. It certainly offsets that slight feeling of ennui that can follow a 2am game binge finish. Call it evolutionary wiring, call it Protestant work ethic, but an arduous boss fight against Dragaux combined with actual physical ardour has a lovely back-patting richness.</p>
<p>As did my sugary chai midway through the day.</p>
<h2><strong>6) The boss level music is epic and might not even be the best</strong></h2>

<p>I actually bought the game at release because I heard the main menu <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w2k_WlpG7zw">music</a> linked to on a forum. I’d thought the game looked a bit silly and on-the-nose, with its literal <em>abs-as-shield</em> and floating spirit feet for leg exercises and so on. But the reviews had intrigued me, then hearing that bright, poppy, electro-optimism sealed the deal.</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/nintendo-switch/related-articles:92778 @ 1766989229 -->
<p>I’m also partial to the cooldown music, and the calm voice of the lady who guides it, which is basically part of the texture. And the brass-blare when you do the victory pose sounds like <strong>Walking On Sunshine</strong>. And the winter level theme is great.</p>
<p><em>But!</em> The chord sequence in the Drageux boss levels is epic and rousing and I can feel that slight lift in the legs and straightening of the back, living up to the showdown music, slightly revived by the drama.</p>
<h2><strong>7) Cats truly give no Ring Fits</strong></h2>
<figure data-uuid="abce21262bc58"><a title="Ring Fit Adventure" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/abce21262bc58/ring-fit-adventure.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Omar Hafeez-Bore / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Both were pretty good at not getting kicked by my flailing legs or whatever. But like I said my idea of Cat-Crufts instincts kicking in and them jumping through the Ring with nonchalant grace did not come true.</p>
<h2><strong>8) The UI is a treat to navigate</strong></h2>
<p>At Hour Five on Day Two I really appreciated this, splayed on the sofa and treating myself to a bit of RPG house-keeping: clicking across skill-point menus and flitting between worlds with pleasing speed; hearing the different harmonized tones as you <em>boop</em> across the main menu creating an impromptu remix; growing to like the the weirdly literal use of the actual box as the icon for the main adventure because everything has such a pleasant, player-forward vibe.</p>
<p>This is UI design as encouraging as a personal trainer, and then the California summer pastel and bossa-nova lilt of the smoothie-squeezing is a menu vibe you could book a holiday in.</p>
<figure data-uuid="b6f9f8f430758"><a title="Ring Fit Adventure" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/b6f9f8f430758/ring-fit-adventure.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Omar Hafeez-Bore / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>But! This is all emboldened by:</p>
<h2><strong>9) The</strong> <strong><em>happiest</em></strong> <strong>of haptics</strong></h2>
<p>Seriously, the HD rumble deserves its own review, especially finding sweet spots of position and feeling that tremble of confirmation through the joy-cons, like Will finding areas of thickened air for his Subtle Knife.</p>
<p>I might be overstating this, but it really is one of the most pleasing uses of tactile affirmation in games.<br>
Anyway.</p>
<h2><strong>10) Every time I run or go to the gym, I vaguely intend to do some mobility but never do</strong></h2>
<figure data-uuid="2d75d3ac19e49"><a title="Ring Fit Adventure" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/2d75d3ac19e49/ring-fit-adventure.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Omar Hafeez-Bore / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>All the podcasts go on about it. My brother can squat like a 3-year-old making a sandcastle. But years go by and I still have the flexibility of a parking bollard.</p>
<p>But Ring Fit forces me to stand like a tree to bamboozle dangerous flying insect enemies (this is presumably not a transferable skill) and doesn’t give my girl that super-saiyan magnesium-burn hair of feedback unless I squat to the limits of my groin, now done so much that I’m converted or at least recalibrated.</p>
<h2><strong>11) Minigames Max fun</strong></h2>
<figure data-uuid="512b628b1ba1b"><a title="Ring Fit Adventure" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/512b628b1ba1b/ring-fit-adventure.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Omar Hafeez-Bore / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Seriously, these are the best minigames since <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/super_monkey_ball">Super Monkey Ball</a> or <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/ds/super_mario_64_ds">Super Mario 64 DS</a> (shoutout to Astrolander in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/timesplitters_2">Timesplitters 2</a>, the best of all time).</p>
<p>Robo-Wrecker is a brilliant circular Whack-A-Mole, and Squattery Wheel sounds like the best kind of pun-first fun. In general there’s an old-school sense of kitchen-sink generosity from an era before the crutch of updates and patches, and with a one-chance exhaustive imagination of there never again being a chance to use this Ring Fit controller.</p>
<h2><strong>12) (Like this article) It is</strong> <strong><em>shockingly</em></strong> <strong>long</strong></h2>

<p>So I had to strategise.</p>
<p>I had done about 14 worlds after my first, ambling, intermittent half-decade with the game. 40-odd hours according to the Switch timer (which included a good amount of messing about with minigames and that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wiiu/splatoon">Splatoon</a> banger in the rhythm game). When I looked it up and found out there were 23 (!) worlds, I was impressed and a bit <em>uh-oh</em>..</p>
<p>It quickly became apparent that my previous random machismo choice to do everything at level 30 was not going to fly. Even at level 24, the amount of reps-per-battle was formidable.</p>
<p>So I put it down to level 1, which reduced the reps per exercise in battles and the time for long-holds. But there’s still a world to be traversed, a certain amount of paths to be jogged, sprinted, mud-trudged, high-kneed, canoe-rowed and flown across.</p>
<p>This gave things a meta-layer of strategy. Choosing to re-run levels with those rare persimmons (what a word!) to make a smoothie that would Double EXP to deploy only in a boss battle or prolonged battle arena. Or forcing me to sell precious gems like phosphophyllite (what a word!) to make enough money to unlock three-star skills in the skill tree like my beloved Russian Twist (level 3!).</p>
<p>The point is, sometimes you need an excuse to engage, and speed-rushing Ring Fit was a blast that made me lean into the game systems more than I had before.</p>
<h2><strong>13) It's been a lovely send-off for Switch 1 and for the year</strong></h2>
<figure data-uuid="92cd7845ebbcf"><a title="Ring Fit Adventure" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/92cd7845ebbcf/ring-fit-adventure.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Omar Hafeez-Bore / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Will there ever be a Ring Fit 2? I hope so, but am not confident. I had to bring out the OG Switch again to charge its rail track Joy-Con for the controller, surprised at the suddenly slightly hazy 1080p of the homescreen on my TV.</p>
<p>Will I ever use my Switch 1 for anything else? Again, I’m not sure - my Switch 2 can do most things better. But it can’t do Ring Fit without those old Joy-Con, and now I’m chuffed to have actually finished it. What else can I do with the right excuse?</p>
<p>Let’s go, 2026.</p>
