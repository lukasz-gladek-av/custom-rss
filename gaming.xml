			<p>If you've been eagerly awaiting the collaboration between Behavior Interactive and Supermassive Games (makers of Until Dawn, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-quarry-supermassive-big-screen/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Quarry</a>, and The Dark Pictures games), you won't have to wait much longer. The release date for The Casting of Frank Stone has been officially confirmed. For those eagerly wanting to get stuck into this game, you only have to wait until September 3 for the release.</p>
<p>This new game combines the fantastic storytelling skills of Supermassive Games with the excellent survival horror instincts of Behavior Interactive. This game is set in the <a href="https://wccftech.com/dead-by-daylight-d-and-d-castlevania-2v8-project-t-what-the-fog-spinoff-shadow-drop/">Dead by Daylight</a> universe and will give those who want to know more about the world a brand-new insight into the horrors that lurk in the Fog.</p>
<p>Standard and Deluxe Editions are available for pre-order if you want to own The Casting of Frank Stone as soon as possible. Those who play Dead by Daylight will be able to get their hands on some rewards just by purchasing The Casting of Frank Stone.</p>
<p>These rewards include a "Murder Mill" shirt cosmetic for all survivors, a "Murder Mill" badge and banner, and 2 million Bloodpoints! Additionally, players will be given an ability called Plunderer's Instinct, which will allow players to receive hints to find hidden collectibles in The Casting of Frank Stone.</p>
<p>The Casting of Frank Stone has a new trailer for those interested in sinking their teeth into this cosmic mystery. It shows off the "Murder Mill" <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N6FODK6lwtM&amp;feature=youtu.be" target="_blank" rel="noopener">homemade horror movie</a>, which is the core of the narrative for this new horror game. However, something isn't quite right. This movie is covered in a thick cloak of urban legend and cosmic mystery around every corner. Each time the movie was screened, the audience was overcome with horrific murderous impulses.</p>
<p>Whether that story is true remains up to the player to uncover in a twisted tale set in a city called Cedar Hills, where the name of Frank Stone looms forever. A young group of friends goes on a journey to uncover the truth of his story and finds that his legacy has tainted the town they live in, leaving scars and open wounds across multiple generations and even the cosmos itself.</p>

<p>As with every Supermassive Game, there will be hefty choices to make, impacting how your time in the game plays out. Will everyone survive, or will they be picked off individually as you try to uncover the story of Frank Stone? You'll also see some familiar elements from Dead by Daylight sprinkled through the story of this game, reminding you of just how connected the universes are.</p>
<p>It's time to start counting down the days until The Casting of Frank Stone's release.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/dead-by-daylight-2v8-game-mode-and-cross-progression-date-reveal/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Dead by Daylight is expecting a massive update with <a href="https://wccftech.com/dead-by-daylight-d-and-d-castlevania-2v8-project-t-what-the-fog-spinoff-shadow-drop/">plenty of content</a> and scares planned for July. We are about halfway through the month and have already seen Lara Croft, the ultimate survival queen, be added to Dead by Daylight. The release of Lara Croft comes with three brand new perks to look out for Finesse, Hardened, and Specialist. Unfortunately, she is ill-equipped and won't be able to use any gun or crossbow to help keep her alive, and she has to rely solely on her wits to survive the Fog. Dead by Daylight also introduces cross-progression and a brand-new 2v8 Game Mode.</p>
<p>In addition to Lara Croft being added to Dead by Daylight, survivors and killers enjoy the new game mode coming. On July 25, players will get to experience a 2v8 game mode. In this game mode, you can either team up with a fellow killer or join a group of survivors. Two killers are tasked with finding and killing all eight survivors across five classic maps.</p>
<p><iframe title="Dead by Daylight | Tomb Raider | Official Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JVtkcHfHcNc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Don't expect it to be easy, though. You now have to secure 8 out of 13 generators to escape. There will be no use of Hooks or Perks to keep the game mode fresh. Instead, caught survivors will be taken directly to Cages once downed. In replacement of Perks, survivors will have access to a class system where they can pick a specific "role" within their team.</p>
<p><iframe title="Dead by Daylight | 2v8 Reveal Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TCumCxtPTew?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Killers will also experience a shake-up with their Powers, as they have gotten a new look to keep the game mode fresh and exciting. They also have a powerful timed ability to use in conjunction with the other killers to make or break the game. This game mode will be available from July 25 to August 8.</p>
<p>The third central point of the Dead by Daylight update is that Cross-Progression is finally coming. For those who play the game across multiple platforms, you can finally sync up your progress to continue from where you left off across all platforms. All players need to ensure that they can access cross-progression in a <a href="https://support.bhvr.com/hc/en-us/articles/8265968349460-How-to-enable-Cross-Progression-via-a-Behaviour-Account#:~:text=Navigate%20to%20the%20My%20Account,platform%20to%20confirm%20your%20identity." target="_blank" rel="noopener">Behavior account</a> to link their progress to their account.</p>
<p>The only downside of the Dead by Daylight cross-progression is that those who play on platforms and a Nintendo Switch cannot access their paid currency or DLC on Nintendo Switch if they are syncing up with another platform. Cross-progression will be available on July 22 for all players to access.</p>

But thankfully, it’s shaping up to have some gems of its own. We’ve collected nine of the best to add to your viewing schedule.<br></p><p>If there is a theme to this season’s lineup, it should be superb second seasons. That could be purely attributed to 2023 darling <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/kotatsu-anime-corner-hidive-oshi-no-ko-kaguya-sama-1850384126&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/kotatsu-anime-corner-hidive-oshi-no-ko-kaguya-sama-1850384126"><em>Oshi no Ko</em></a></span><em> </em>making its hotly anticipated return, but it’s also joined by sophomore runs of the <em>NieR: Automata</em> anime,<em> Tower of God</em>, and <em>Shy</em>. Of course, a lot of new shows are also on this list for you to check out. Here are nine anime you shouldn’t miss this summer 2024. </p></div></div><div><p><strong>Watch it on: MAX, Hulu</strong></p><p>There’s a genius to the simplicity of <em>Suicide Squad ISEKAI</em>: Send the DC universe’s team of villains into a tropey fantasy world, let them run wild, and hilarity will ensue. The Suicide Squad are well known enough now (thanks to two movies and a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/suicide-squad-justice-league-review-is-it-good-batman-1851222047&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/suicide-squad-justice-league-review-is-it-good-batman-1851222047">mediocre game</a></span>) that the anime dosn’t have to work overtime to familiarize the audience with the characters and their whole deal. This iteration of the team keeps it mostly classic, with the likes of Harley Quinn, Peacemaker, King Shark, Deadshot and Clayface, though—as is so often the case with this lot—this has proven to be Harley’s show, and I’m not complaining at all.</p><p>Watching the oddball team of villains deal with the often tongue-in-cheek issues of a fantasy realm at war has proven to be a wonderful combination, and seeing more DC characters pop up in the future will only add to the fun. The show also retains the team’s signature penchant for violence, and it looks fantastic in its energetic and colorful animation style.</p></div><div><p><strong>Watch it on: HIDIVE</strong></p><p>The first season of <em>Oshi no Ko</em> was one of 2023’s best anime, and the second aims to repeat the success in 2024. Based on the first two episodes, it’s going to easily accomplish that. For the uninitiated, <em>Oshi no Ko</em> follows siblings Aqua and Ruby, twin children of the murdered pop idol Ai Hoshino, on their dual missions to gain stardom while solving their mother’s murder. The first season saw the twins push into the world of fame in their own ways, Aqua through acting and Ruby through singing, while Aqua some detective work on the side. </p><p>Season one was an enthralling arc that had a lot to say about the dangers of celebrity and how society builds up these stars, holds them to insane standards, and turns on them in a second. The show’s wonderful writing and gorgeous animation made its expert weaving of comedy, drama, and mystery seem effortless. Season two throws us right into the next phase of Aqua’s investigation, set in the midst of a high-stakes theatrical production.</p></div><div><p><strong>Watch it on: HIDIVE</strong></p><p>If you are looking for something to fill the void left by <em>Delicious in Dungeon</em>, then <em>Dungeon People</em> is your best bet. The new anime follows a thief who gets an unexpected job offer to manage a dungeon full of monsters. It’s a fun twist on the dungeon fantasy formula that offers some more slice-of-life-style storytelling. </p><p>If you like the off-kilter approach to a <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons </em>style campaign that <em>Delicious in Dungeon</em> often had, there is a lot in <em>Dungeon People</em> that can scratch that itch. So far it doesn’t do anything as spectacular in its storytelling and character work as <em>Frieren </em>or <em>Delicious in Dungeon,</em> but it’s a cute show to relax with.</p></div><div><p><strong>Watch it on: Crunchyroll</strong></p><p>Simply put,<em> </em><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/nier-automata-anime-part-2-crunchyroll-adaptation-1851585264&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/nier-automata-anime-part-2-crunchyroll-adaptation-1851585264"><em>NieR: Automata Ver1.1a</em></a></span> is the best video game adaptation around right now. The first part of the season (which aired last year) made this abundantly clear by offering new twists for returning fans of the game while also managing to be a succinct and engaging retread of the original story for newcomers. </p><p>Part two of season one looks to dive into the real meat of <em>NieR: Automata</em>, with the game’s endings A and B behind us. Returning viewers can expect even more philosophical conundrums and rugs being pulled out from under them. The first episode alone is a stunning reinterpretation of one of the source material’s most incredible moments. Hopefully this bundle of episodes won’t be plagued by the production issues of the first part.</p></div><div><p><strong>Watch it on: Crunchyroll</strong></p><p>I’m always looking out for the next great rom-com anime whenever a new season drops its lineup. In the past we’ve gotten the likes of <em>Kaguya-sama: Love is War</em> or last years’ <em>Skip and Loafer</em>. <em>Alya Sometimes Hides Her Feelings in Russian</em> isn’t quite on that level yet, but I’m cautiously optimistic that it could be after a few more episodes. </p><p>Alya is a straight-laced student council member constantly berating Kuze for his antics, but she does find him cute and secretly says as much…in Russian. Of course, Kuze understands Russian and can’t find a way to tell Alya that he’s been able to understand her confessions all this time. What ensues in the first couple of episodes is a cute and combative relationship between the two. So far the duo have great chemistry, which is essential to success, but I’m still waiting for the show to be more than the typical genre trappings. There is a fanservice-y moment in the premiere that made me roll my eyes, but Alya and Kuze have unexpectedly serious discussion about it immediately after. If we are lucky this won’t devolve into pure fanservice and instead move past genre tropes to be something special.</p></div><div><p><strong>Watch it on: Crunchyroll</strong></p><p>This might be the best-looking show of the season. The premiere alone has gorgeous animation and stunning use of color, from bright foliage to deep red blood. But <em>The Elusive Samurai </em>is more than a pretty face. It follows Tokiyuki, a carefree kid who just wants to live in peace but is thrust into a violent world after a brutal coup.</p><p>That conflict between peace and war at the heart of Tokiyuki’s journey is reflected in the show’s gorgeous animation. There is a lot of juxtaposing imagery that further visualizes that internal conflict. With such a strong protagonist and animation, I have high hopes that <em>The Elusive Samurai </em>will be able to sustain the standard set by its premiere.</p></div><div><p><strong>Watch it on: Crunchyroll</strong></p><p>I love how heartfelt yet over-the-top sports girl anime always are. That’s why I’m already into <em>Narenare -Cheer for you!-</em>. I appreciate that the show takes cheerleading seriously as a sport. The way each girl talks about cheer is done without joking about it and the animation highlights how beautiful yet difficult it is. The core cast is constantly dedicating time and energy to their sport and their passion endears the audience to them.</p><p>Back to the animation—Wow, this show is gorgeous. It combines an almost pastel color-palette with a slight highlighting effect over everything that gives it an almost pop art feel. Of course, with any show like this I don’t want to get my hopes up about the yuri-potential, so if you are hoping for that just manage your expectations. </p></div><div><p><strong>Watch it on: Crunchyroll</strong></p><p><em>Mayonaka Punch</em> came out of nowhere and dazzled me with its premiere. It begins with our protagonist, Masaki, getting booted from her three- woman YouTuber group for being too violent after punching one of her costars on a livestream. She tries to start a new channel to regain her fanbase, but is disheartened by the constant hate she gets for her violent actions and the fact that her new channel bombs. Masiki’s luck turns around when she meets Live, a vampire who’s been having mysterious dreams of Masaki and is hell bent on drinking her blood. Masaki comes up with the bright idea to make spectacular videos using Live’s powers, and in exchange Live can feed on Masaki once her new channel reaches one million subscribers.</p><p>Masaki is an amazing protagonist whose brashness makes her an enjoyable girl failure, while Live’s overeager thirst for Masaki comes off as an adoring obsession. The first couple of episodes are full of fun hijinx, and there is some potential for Live and Masaki’s relationship to grow into something more than just a means to an end for both of them.</p></div><div><p><strong>Watch it on: Crunchyroll</strong></p><p>I’ll be honest, <em>Tower of God </em>season two doesn’t have the juice in the same way that season one did back in 2020. The animation style has a much less distinct identity, especially with the lack of those bold black lines, yet I am still hooked. While the aesthetics might not be there, the world still is. </p><p>The titular Tower, and the inhabitants inside it fighting to make their way to the top, are still so well fleshed out that I can’t help but be interested in what awaits them all. Even after four years, It’s good to see Bam back and I’m ready to hopefully get some answers on season one’s cliffhanger and what’s really up with Rachel.</p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<!-- cache hit 40:single/related:9fbcecc4a267a305eb83c5f8a0b76700 --><!-- empty -->
<p>How badly do you want to play the upcoming <a href="https://store.focus-entmt.com/us/warhammer40000spacemarine2"><em>Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2</em></a> ahead of its September 9 launch? Enough to torrent a 75GB package from a Russian site? Enough to not only unpack and play it, but connect to a server and start building up your character?</p>
<p>Me neither, but that hasn't stopped seemingly hundreds of people from doing just that. Publisher Focus Entertainment had announced the third-person action game having "gone gold" (released for manufacturing) <a href="https://x.com/Focus_entmt/status/1810722430144631112">on July 9</a>. The leaked build might date to February 23, 2024, as <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/spaice-marine-2-leak-playable/">suggested by site Insider Gaming</a>, which had <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240715211516/https://insider-gaming.com/spaice-marine-2-leak-playable/">previously suggested a June 20 date</a>.</p>
<p>Footage from the leaked builds, which has been mostly taken offline by Focus through copyright claims, suggested that it was a mostly complete version of the game, with some placeholder assets in menus. Said footage also suggests that the game's pirates are playing online, and their characters are retaining their levels and items. For now, at least.</p>
<figure><p><iframe type="text/html" width="980" height="550" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5tqDxvpzsKM?start=0&amp;wmode=transparent" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><figcaption><p>Gameplay overview trailer for <em>Warhammer 40,000: </em><em>Space Marine 2</em>.</p></figcaption></figure>
<p>In some ways, this shouldn't really matter. When the game's servers go officially live, developer Saber Interactive and Focus should be able to flag those accounts that have logged unauthorized time. Getting online to play will likely require authentication from the Steam, Xbox, or PlayStation platform one chooses. And there's a chance that a closer look at the game, or even just news about its leak, might entice more people into buying and playing the game proper.</p>                                                                        
                                                                                
<figure><figcaption><p>Focus Entertainment</p></figcaption></figure>
<p>In other ways, though, it stinks. Spoilers from the game's campaign and multiplayer offerings will filter out, and firms that should be focusing entirely on release and quality control will have to deal with the security and fairness aspects of such a leak. A planned open beta of the game had <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/space-marine-2-dev-cancels-open-beta-hands-out-bolt-pistol-skin-as-an-apology">already been canceled</a>&nbsp;in favor of the developer's focus on launch readiness.</p>
<p>Game leaks of this scale aren't as common as select images or isolated information, but it does happen. <em>Grand Theft Auto VI</em> had <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/12/grand-theft-auto-vi-trailer-confirms-many-things-including-its-florida-vibes/">nearly an hour of gameplay footage leak in 2022</a>. Discs of <em>Starfield </em>being posted for sale in August 2023, weeks ahead of its September release, resulted in <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/08/starfield-leaker-arrested-for-felony-theft-after-attempting-to-sell-early-copies/">felony charges for a Tennessee man</a>. Videos spoiling much of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/05/be-warned-massive-the-last-of-us-part-2-spoilers-have-been-leaked/"><em>The Last of Us Part 2</em> leaked online</a> in 2020, thanks to someone "not affiliated" with its developer and publisher.</p>
<p>And the biggest and most unexpected hack and leak came from a small German town, where Axel Gembe <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2016/06/what-drove-one-half-life-2-super-fan-to-hack-into-valves-servers/">stole and leaked early source code for <em>Half-Life 2</em></a>. He later tried to apologize to Valve founder Gabe Newell and leverage his break-in to land a job at Valve, which was, to say the least, unsuccessful.
</p><p>Ars has contacted Focus Entertainment for comment and will update this post with new information.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gameinformer.com/2024/07/16/dead-by-deadlight-gets-lara-croft-survivor-today-2v8-mode-and-cross-progression-on-the<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Dead by Daylight’s 8th-anniversary stream revealed a few big updates for the popular asymmetrical horror game. The most immediate is the addition of Lara Croft as the game’s latest crossover survivor along with the impending addition of the much-requested 2v8 mode.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Tomb Raider Chapter</h2>

<p>Lara Croft (the 2013 reboot version, specifically) joins DBD today, and though she lacks her pistols and bow, she sports three new perks highlighting her adventuring prowess. Here's an explanation of each per DBD's website:</p>

<ul><li><strong>Finesse:</strong>&nbsp;Your fast vaults are faster when healthy, with a cooldown after a successful use.</li>
	<li><strong>Hardened:</strong>&nbsp;When you open a Chest and cleanse or bless a Totem, Hardened activates for the duration of the Trial. From that point, every time you scream, you’ll instead reveal the Killer’s Aura.</li>
	<li><strong>Specialist:</strong>&nbsp;When you open or rummage through a Chest, gain 1 Token (up to 3). When you do a Great Skill Check, consume a Token to reduce the max required Generator progress.</li>
</ul><p><iframe allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JVtkcHfHcNc" width="640"></iframe></p>



<p>On July 25, a new 2v8 multiplayer mode descends into the game. This pits two Killers against eight survivors in expanded versions of five classic maps. The number of generators has been doubled, and Survivors must now repair 8 out of 13 to escape. Captive Survivors are now sent directly into cages, and Survivor perks have been reworked into a new role system designed to encourage teamwork.&nbsp;</p>

<p><iframe allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TCumCxtPTew" width="640"></iframe></p>

<h2>Cross-Progression</h2>

<p>Cross-progression is being implemented on July 22. This means players can now sync their progress across multiple owned versions of the game. Everything can be shared across any platform except for Switch, which has a few restrictions as you can see in the chart below.&nbsp;</p>

			<p>Today, NVIDIA released a new GeForce Game Ready driver, version 560.70, available via the official website, GeForce Experience, or the new NVIDIA app. This driver is optimized for three upcoming game launches: A44's Soulslite <a href="https://wccftech.com/flintlock-the-siege-of-dawn-hands-on-preview-enjoyable-soulslite-action/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Flintlock: The Siege of Dawn</a>, Mithril Interactive's first-person 'extraction fantasy dungeon crawler' <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2448970/Dungeonborne/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dungeonborne</a>, and Frost Giant's Warcraft-inspired real-time strategy game <a href="https://wccftech.com/warcraft-inspired-stormgate-rts-is-well-on-its-way-to-become-the-biggest-kickstarter-game-campaign-in-a-while/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Stormgate</a>.</p>
<p>All of these games support NVIDIA DLSS Super Resolution and DLSS Frame Generation. Interestingly, NVIDIA also revealed that Flintlock: The Siege Dawn uses the AI-based Audio2Face technique to create facial animation and lip-syncing based on audio files.</p>
<p>NVIDIA also shared some benchmark data for Dungeonborne. DLSS 3 (Super Resolution and Frame Generation) can accelerate frame rates by 3.3x on average at 4K resolution with ray tracing enabled. The RTX 4090 graphics card registered nearly 190 average frames per second, and even the RTX 4060 was over 60 frames per second.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>GeForce RTX 40 users will also be able to try two NVIDIA DLSS in two upcoming beta tests: <a href="https://wccftech.com/throne-and-liberty-f2p-mmorpg-launches-on-september-17-on-pc-and-consoles-with-cross-play/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Throne and Liberty</a> (July 18-23) and <a href="https://wccftech.com/marvel-games-announces-marvel-rivals-closed-beta-with-cross-platform-capabilities/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Marvel Rivals</a> (July 23-August 5).</p>
<p>This GeForce Game Ready driver also introduces fourteen new G-Sync Compatible displays, which are listed in the table below.</p>

One member, who goes by Shrimp Blimp, told <em>Kotaku</em> the roleplaying kicked off a few hours later and lasted until around 6 a.m. ET, after moderators repeatedly stated that roleplaying was banned. As one might expect from a newly opened Discord server, the chat was also peppered with racist, sexist, and homophobic language, edgy memes, and even an allegation of grooming, but its primary function, at least for a while, was as a space for <em>The Boys</em> cosplay.</p><figure id="" data-id="1b93e38219e63896e51fd6a180f8f5c8" data-recommend-id="image://1b93e38219e63896e51fd6a180f8f5c8" data-format="png" data-width="280" data-height="347" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot of the DC Official Discord." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A screenshot of the DC Official Discord." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Discord / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="1b93e38219e63896e51fd6a180f8f5c8" data-recommend-id="image://1b93e38219e63896e51fd6a180f8f5c8" data-format="png" data-width="280" data-height="347" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot of the DC Official Discord." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Though there were certainly members pretending to be other fictional characters and real-life people, including one person claiming they were the Green Goblin who implored people to buy his <em>Fortnite</em> bundle, and another with the username OJ Simpson, by and large the DC Official Discord was a <em>The Boys</em> roleplay session for over 12 hours. This is at least somewhat appropriate considering the comic is published by DC, but was taken to the extreme by the server’s members. Dozens changed their names to characters from the series or variations of those characters (including “gay Homelander”) and sent messages in the chat as if they were actually those people.<br></p><p>A Billy Butcher roleplayer (played by Karl Urban in the show, but probably not the Discord) wrote out all their words with an obvious Cockney accent, while someone pretending to be Kimiko (a non-verbal character who communicates via her own version of sign language,played by Karen Fukuhara) sent only hand signal emojis in the chat. Someone pretending to be Frenchie, the character with a close relationship to Kimiko and the only one who can understand her signing, occasionally responded to her with hand signal emojis. </p><p>At one point, a Homelander roleplayer quoted a line from a recent episode from <em>The Boys</em> in which the evil-Superman-coded character demanded one of the other superheroes fellate the other. “Vought [the evil in-universe corporation tied to the superheroes] will now take control of this server. Do not worry, America. The Seven will safely moderate this server from here,” wrote another Homelander at 4:52 p.m. ET.</p><figure id="" data-id="f7e2de72370baca484d5bb0a2bdd000e" data-recommend-id="image://f7e2de72370baca484d5bb0a2bdd000e" data-format="png" data-width="618" data-height="306" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screen shot from the DC Official Discord." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A screen shot from the DC Official Discord." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Discord / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="f7e2de72370baca484d5bb0a2bdd000e" data-recommend-id="image://f7e2de72370baca484d5bb0a2bdd000e" data-format="png" data-width="618" data-height="306" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screen shot from the DC Official Discord." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>At around midnight ET, a moderator dropped a message in the general chat that read:<br></p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>“Hi everyone!<br>-No inappropriate memes/jokes are allowed<br>-No RP or Parody accounts are allowed<br>- We’re muting/banning people who do not follow the rules<br>-Please notify the Mod Team of anything weird</p></blockquote><p>Someone replied, “Half the server is getting banned.” Another member, who appeared to have been cosplaying Frenchie at one point, sent an approximation of the word “Frenchie” spelled out in American Sign Language along with the message, “we aren’t allowed to roleplay.”<br></p><p>Despite the warnings, the roleplaying continued—at 6 a.m. ET, a person pretending to be <em>The Boys</em>’ vice presidential candidate who can explode people’s heads with her mind, Victoria Neuman, asked “where’s Homelander?” A Butcher cosplayer replied, “with me,” while several other users claimed the flying hero “landed at home.” Several people changed their name to “Not Homelander” or “Not Billy Butcher” in an attempt to circumvent the anti-RP rule. Not Homelander had a profile pic of his actor, Anthony Starr in-character with a mustache Photoshopped onto his face. </p><p>The anti-RP message was shared around a dozen times by more than one moderator, the latest of which was sent at around 11 a.m. ET. As of the time of publication, the roleplaying has almost completely ceased, but many are unsurprised a DC-focused server would descend into chaos so swiftly. <em>Kotaku</em> reached out to an Official DC Discord moderator for comment.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Fortnite’s Chapter 5, Season 3, is set to be a blast from the past as the game brings back beloved weapons with its latest unvault announcement. The return of fan favourites like the Flint Knock Pistol and the Mammoth Pistol will surely stir up some nostalgia among players. Be sure to check out all the weapons that Fortnite has unvaulted and vaulted this week.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Fortnite Reload, the new fast-paced battle royale mode, will see the most new weapons arrive. As revealed by the Fortnite Status account, the weapons that have been unvaulted for the Reload mode include the Thunder Pump Shotgun, the Twin Mag SMG and the Mammoth Pistol. On the other hand, the Lever Action Shotgun, the Tactical Submachine Gun and the Hand Cannon will be vaulted going forward.</p>

<p>A reliable source of Fortnite leaks, ShiinaBR, has revealed that a classic Fortnite weapon has been unvaulted. The Flint-Knock Pistol, fondly known as the ‘Yeet Pistol’ (courtesy of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?app=desktop&amp;v=b6yDfg1y-fA" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Lazarbeam</a>), has been unvaulted for Fortnite Battle Royale.</p>

The Pirates of the Caribbean crew will be sold through the item shop.&nbsp;</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Black Ops 6 - Vault Edition Trailer</p>
      </div>
<h2 dir="ltr" id="What_to_expect_from_Season_5">What to expect from Season 5</h2><p dir="ltr">A new season of Call of Duty means a brand-new battle pass is on the way, which usually introduces at least one new operator for MW3 and Warzone. New seasons typically include two or three weapons in the free tiers of the battle pass.</p><p dir="ltr">The past few seasons of MW3 have included several events for unlocking free cosmetic items, such as camos, weapon blueprints, and calling cards. The only event confirmed by Activision is the upcoming collaboration with the WWE. Nothing specific is detailed for the WWE crossover event, but there will likely be free rewards to earn as well as shop bundles for operators.</p><p dir="ltr">It was previously suggested by leakers that a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cod-warzone-and-mw3-might-include-a-deadpool-wolverine-crossover-in-season-5/1100-6524622/">Deadpool could crossover to Call of Duty</a>, as data mining allegedly revealed a series of potential finishing moves with poses and mannerisms reminiscent of Marvel's "Merc with a Mouth." It's possible these over-the-top finishing moves are related to a WWE superstar instead, but Season 5's launch does closely match up with the release of Deadpool &amp; Wolverine, so a Marvel crossover event does fit the timeline.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Warzone">Warzone</h2><p dir="ltr">Activision has teased the return of the Superstore point of interest, which was one of the most-popular landing spots on the Verdansk map. Superstore will arrive to Urzikstan sometime in Season 5.</p><p dir="ltr">The trailer announcement for the Superstore POI also includes a first look at potential weapons and cosmetics coming to the game. One operator has a guitar on their back, which could mean it's a new melee weapon or a cosmetic variant of an existing melee weapon included in an upcoming operator bundle. Players are already suggesting that one weapon shown could potentially be a <a href="https://x.com/charlieINTEL/status/1813230866904088890" rel="nofollow ">modernized version of the STG-44 assault rifle</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">While we only have the one major announcement for battle royale so far, Season 5 will likely include more game modes, limited-time events, and feature a few weapon balances and small changes.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Modern_Warfare_3">Modern Warfare 3</h2><p dir="ltr">Three map variants are confirmed for Modern Warfare 3's multiplayer. These will be cel-shaded variants of fan-favorite maps:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Toonoxide - Rust</li><li dir="ltr">Celship - Shipment</li><li dir="ltr">Ink House - Stash House</li></ul><p dir="ltr">For Zombies mode, it's uncertain if players will get any new content at launch. Season 5 is set to include the final story mission for Modern Warfare 3's Dark Aether narrative, but this content is <a href="https://x.com/MrDalekJD/status/1795826445421580385" rel="nofollow ">scheduled for the midseason "Reloaded" update</a>.</p>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/ea-sports-college-football-25/">EA Sports College Football 25</a> has plenty of surprises for those down on the field, but also up in the sky. During a clip shared by the <a href="https://x.com/UCF_Football/status/1812998691311263956" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Twitter/X</a> account of UCF Football, the commentator makes a note of a rocket launch happening in the midst of a game.</p><p>"And if we can divert your attention for the sky for a second, what an amazing sight that is," says the in-game commentator in the clip, as "Sandstorm" by Darude plays in the background. "Few people know that the 50-yard line at UCF Stadium lines up with the launch pad at Cape Canaveral about 50 miles away."</p>

<p>The attention to detail in display refers to the Cape Canaveral Space Force Station. It's unlikely that the in-game moment will mimic real-life events--<a href="https://english.news.cn/20240713/e40351d7ff064bde8ff811dc2d0b418a/c.html" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">exploding rockets</a> might be a bit too distracting--but it's nice to see either way.</p><p>Cape Canaveral has been on the news lately with the first-ever <a href="https://www.space.com/news/live/boeing-starliner-live-updates" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Starliner astronaut mission</a> for NASA on behalf of Boeing. The mission, which started on June 6 and was initially set as a 10-day flight, has been extended indefinitely. The crew has been in orbit for more than a month now. In a <a href="https://www.space.com/boeing-starliner-no-return-date-from-iss" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">press conference</a> on July 10, manager of NASA's Commercial Crew Program Steve Stich said that the capsule experienced helium leaks and thruster issues during the trip.

<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/super-mario-rpg-review">Super Mario RPG</a> was initially released in 1996 for the SNES, and over two decades later, a remake has been released for Nintendo Switch. Super Mario RPG for Switch is an excellent game, even being a great entry point into the world of RPGs. As one of the wackiest <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/all-mario-games-on-nintendo-switch">Mario games on Switch</a>, there are dozens of unique characters to discover who have never appeared outside of this title. It's also one of the rare occasions where Mario and Bowser work together - the King of the Koopas even joins your party! On top of all that, the legendary Yoko Shimomura returned to compose the soundtrack, making for an unforgettable Mario experience that is definitely worth it at this price.<h2>Advance Wars 1+2: Re-Boot Camp for $52.99</h2><div id="203271" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Advance Wars 1+2: Re-Boot Camp - Nintendo Switch</h3></p></div>
<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/advance-wars-12-re-boot-camp-review">Advance Wars 1+2: Re-Boot Camp</a> is a complete remake of the first two Advance War titles from Wayforward and Nintendo. This game marks the first entry in the Advance Wars series since Advance Wars: Days of Ruin on the Nintendo DS, bringing back Advance Wars and Advance Wars 2: Black Hole Rising. Some of the biggest changes available in these remakes are a re-recorded original soundtrack, online versus play, and the massive shift in art style from 2D to 3D. Overall, this collection is an excellent way to revisit one of Nintendo's most beloved strategy titles. <h2>Cuphead for $24.99</h2><div id="203272" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Cuphead - Nintendo Switch</h3></p></div>
<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2017/10/02/cuphead-review">Cuphead</a> is one of the best platformers of the last decade, featuring an extremely unique art style that is based on rubber hose animation. Don't be fooled by its charming looks, though - Cuphead can be absolutely brutal with dozens of challenging bosses. The Nintendo Switch version of the game is excellent with 60FPS support, fitting right at home as a platformer on the console.<h2>Demon Slayer: The Hinokami Chronicles for $29.99</h2><div id="203278" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Demon Slayer: The Hinokami Chronicles - Nintendo Switch</h3></p></div>
<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/demon-slayer-kimetsu-no-yaiba-the-hinokami-chronicles-review">Demon Slayer: The Hinokami Chronicles</a> is still the best Demon Slayer game out there. The flashy title features over 30 characters, with the story covered through the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/demon-slayer-season-2-premiere-entertainment-district-arc-review">Entertainment District Arc</a>. You can dive head first into Adventure Mode and relive the major story moments of the hit manga, or you can choose to battle it out against others in Versus Mode. Explore unique matchups that were never before possible, like Rui vs. Tengen. Let your creativity run wild!<h2>Super Mario Bros. Wonder for $56</h2><div id="203265" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Super Mario Bros. Wonder - Nintendo Switch</h3></p></div>Per <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/super-mario-bros-wonder-review">IGN's 9/10 review</a>, Super Mario Bros. Wonder is one of the best games available on the Nintendo Switch, period. As the console's first new 2D Mario title, over 150 different levels are available in this co-op game, with plenty of secrets and challenges to uncover as you play through the story. One of the new features of Wonder is the Badge system, which allows you to grant characters unique abilities to use throughout levels. At $56, the price is likely to drop even lower, but this is a Mario game you do not want to pass up when its on sale.<h2>When Are Switch Games On Sale? </h2><p>The Nintendo eShop pretty much always has digital versions of Switch games on sale, which you can find in the "Great Deals" section of the app on your Switch. While you can't really predict what games you'll find on sale when, you may be able to find a new third-party gem. If you're looking for physical Switch games, whether to manage your console's storage or to add to your collection, you should check out big shopping events like <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/prime-day-vs-black-friday-deals">Prime Day or Black Friday</a>. </p><p>One of the best Switch deals is grabbing a special edition Nintendo Switch, like the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-best-nintendo-switch-lite-deal-of-2024-is-available-ahead-of-prime-day">Animal Crossing Switch Lite</a>, which includes a free Nintendo game. That said, it may be worth waiting for the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-everything-we-know">Nintendo Switch 2</a> if you're looking for a console upgrade. </p><p><em>Noah Hunter is a freelance writer and reviewer with a passion for games and technology.

But Microsoft claimed it was a success, reaching <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-exclusive-hi-fi-rush-hits-2-million-players">two million players in a month</a> and <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hi-fi-rush-review">receiving high praise from critics</a>.

That’s an obvious example of how a studio is successful. Not changing everything every time might be the key to life and surviving."</p><p>Tango Gameworks' closure came alongside other lay-offs at Microsoft, including <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-closes-redfall-developer-arkane-austin-hifi-rush-developer-tango-gameworks-and-more-in-devastating-cuts-at-bethesda">the shutting down of Redfall developer Arkane Austin</a>, amid cuts affecting 1,900 staff.</p><p>Microsoft's gaming executives have remained vague so far on the exact reasons for the closures, but <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-boss-phil-spencer-addresses-studio-closures-ign-live-2024">Xbox boss Phil Spencer later discussed it with IGN</a>.</p><p>"I have to run a sustainable business inside the company and grow, and that means sometimes I have to make hard decisions that frankly are not decisions I love, but decisions that somebody needs to go make," he said.</p><p>Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-reaches-25-million-units-sold-ahead-of-shadow-of-the-erdtree">FromSoftware's Elden Ring has sold an incredible 25 million copies</a>, with <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/those-tough-elden-ring-dlc-requirements-didnt-stop-shadow-of-the-erdtree-sales-it-sold-an-incredible-5-million-in-just-3-days">DLC Shadow of the Erdtree sold five million in just three days</a>.</p><p><em>Ryan Dinsdale is an IGN freelance reporter.
