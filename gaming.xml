<p>After the cancelation of Football Manager 25, developer Sports Interactive is back, teasing news for the upcoming Football Manager 26.</p>



<p>In a short video released on Wednesday, Sports Interactive gave players a glimpse at the “enhanced Match Day experience” from the game. They call it “just a taste of what you can expect” following the shift of the franchise to the Unity engine. At the end of the trailer, it says that a “Match Day First Look” is “coming soon”.</p>

<p><strong>“[Football Manager 26] promises to propel players on an adventure to shape their footballing destiny with our most immersive and visually rich Football Manager experience to date,”</strong> Sports Interactive said. <strong>“All the story-making potential is redefined as players get ever closer to the heart of the beautiful game.”</strong></p>



<p>Football Manager’s move to Unity has been a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/football-manager-25-delayed-again-features-removed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">well-documented journey</a> that led to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/football-manager-25-delayed-to-march-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">multiple delays</a> of Football Manager 25 only for the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/football-manager-25-cancelled-after-multiple-delays/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">game to be canceled</a> altogether.</p>

One of the issues in the crosshairs is the reported "super bullet" causing unexpectedly fast time-to-kill rates.</p><p>BF6's principal game designer Florian Le Bihan <a href="https://x.com/DRUNKKZ3/status/1954828663825817791" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">took to X</a> following the end of the open beta to ask players for videos of "suspected super bullet/unexpectedly fast TTD" bugs. A number of players have reported having this issue in the Battlefield beta, with some streamers even experiencing the issue live on stream. The unusually quick TTD (time to death or time to down) bug causes some players to be downed in just a few shots, and sometimes even when behind cover.</p>

<p>Players were quick to provide examples of the suspected bug, with some speculating that the server was slow to apply damage that had already been received, causing the full amount of damage to be applied to the player all at once after a short delay. Players have also reported taking damage or failing to heal when they should be at full health, including immediately after respawning--though this bug appears to only impact the health-bar UI and not players' actual hit points.</p><p>While some player's TTD issues were put down to regular lag due to a poor internet connection, others have shared videos of the suspected bug in question. Le Bihan later updated to thank players for sharing their footage, saying he's now been sent "a bunch of good videos" to investigate the issue.</p><p>With the first open-beta weekend concluded, players have taken to social media to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-players-certainly-have-some-strong-opinions-after-the-first-open-beta/1100-6533851/" data-ref-id="1100-6533851">share their thoughts on the preview</a>, both good and bad. The beta reached a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-beta-reportedly-reached-a-massive-player-count/1100-6533862/" data-ref-id="1100-6533862">huge number of people</a>, and the developers at DICE no doubt have a big job ahead of them combing through player feedback and bug reports ahead of the game's release on October 10.</p><p>Players will have a chance to check out more Battlefield 6 maps and different modes when the open beta returns for a second weekend on August 14.

Now, it may reach even further heights because Lady Gaga is coming to Dress to Impress for a special event this week.</p><p>Under the rules of Dress to Impress, players are invited to create outfits based on specific themes, and the top three winners are chosen by votes from other players. For this event, the theme is Mayhem, the most recent album from Lady Gaga.</p><p>Starting on August 16, players will be able to compete in Mayhem-themed challenges and earn Lady Gaga-related items and clothing. Style Showdown will also feature a challenge based on Lady Gaga's song Zombieboy. A lucky few may even get a chance to meet Lady Gaga in-game as she judges an outfit competition for herself.</p><p>Outside of the Lady Gaga event, there's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dress-to-impress-codes/1100-6533105/" data-ref-id="1100-6533105">an assortment of free outfits and accessories</a> that can be claimed by Dress to Impress players in August.

            <p>After delaying and then cancelling Football Manager 2025 due to ongoing issues getting the massively reworked game ready, SEGA and Sports Interactive have announced that Football Manager 2026 is coming.</p>
<p>Details on the game are sparse, with no new details beyond the fact that we know Sports Interactive planned for FM25 to be a huge evolution of the series which had seen more iterative changes and improvements over the years prior.</p>
<p>According to SEGA FM26 will "take players on a journey to define their footballing destiny with our most immersive and visually rich Football Manager experience yet. The potential for storytelling is redefined by taking players closer to the heart of the beautiful game."</p>
<p>The move to the Unity game engine should bring the 3D match engine up to modern standards. While the teaser released by Sports Interactive doesn't show an actual match in action, it does tease some in-engine visuals and points to the official Premier League licence.</p>
<p>You can watch that small teaser trailer below:</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ea%E2%80%99s-stock-spiked-thanks-to-the-battlefield-6-beta.1268943/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The first weekend of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/battlefield-6/">Battlefield 6</a> Beta can surely be deemed a success. Its concurrent player count on Steam was in the <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-beta-surpassed-battlefield-2042-all-time-concurrent-player-count-steam/">hundreds of thousands off the jump, immediately surpassing Battlefield 2042</a>. It then continued to rise to <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-beta-breaks-470k-users-steam-anti-cheat-stopped-330k-attempts/">nearly half a million players, again, on Steam alone</a>, and it eventually did pass half a million, even beating the <a href="https://wccftech.com/blizzard-president-battlefield-6-boot-stomp-call-of-duty-black-ops-7/">highest concurrent player count of Call of Duty on Steam</a>.</p>



<p>On that kind of popularity alone, it was a successful weekend. Adding the fact that the game's <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1mky5ll/unpopular_opinion_battlefield_6_is_better_than/">community seems to be on board with Battlefield 6</a> makes it an even bigger success. But it was also immediately successful in helping out Electronic Arts as a whole.</p>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://mp1st.com/news/battlefield-6-beta-pushes-eas-stock-to-all-time-high">MP1st</a>, the Battlefield 6 beta helped spike EA's stocks, with share prices rising <strong>4.7%</strong>, it's largest increase since the end of last month. EA shares were trading at <strong>$176.11</strong> a share thanks to this rise, giving EA an estimated $42 billion evaluation.</p>



<p>It's alltogether a strong start for the series return and its attempt to bring back what used to be an annual bout between Call of Duty and Battlefield, where both sides had nearly equal footing in the shooter space as both series tried capturing players attention. It's unfortunately been a one-sided fight in recent years, with Battlefield barely able to hold a candle to the kinds of numbers Call of Duty is capable of. </p>



<p>This is the first time in what feels like a long time that Battlefield has the chance to take back its slice of the pie that Call of Duty had subsumed. We'll see how this next beta weekend goes, which at the time of this writing is due to start tomorrow, August 14, and run until Sunday, August 17. After that, it'll be a long stretch to October when the game is set to launch.</p>



<p>Hopefully, Battlefield 6 is able to stick the landing, and carry this momentum all the way to a strong launch and an even stronger first year.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Fae Farm Updates and Online Services to End in September]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fae-farm-updates-ending-september</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/fae-farm-updates-and-online-services-to-end-in-september.1268940/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Phoenix Labs has announced that&nbsp;<em>Fae Farm&nbsp;</em>updates will be coming to an end in September, and that the game's online servers will be shutting down at the same time.</p>

<p>In an update on the game's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2230110/Fae_Farm/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Steam page</a>, the studio says the game "will be going offline" on September 10th at 11:59pm Pacific (or around 2am the following day by Eastern time), and that there won't be any further updates for the game after that.</p>

<p>While&nbsp;<em>Fae Farm</em>'s updates and online services will be coming to a close, Phoenix Labs has assured fans that the single-player offline version of the game will remain playable, so if you do own&nbsp;<em>Fae Farm&nbsp;</em>and you're yet to get around to checking it out, you haven't missed your chance.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/fae-farm-updates-ending-farm.jpg?itok=Cm2kwdHq 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/fae-farm-updates-ending-farm.jpg?itok=bfK8-fcs 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Updates for&nbsp;<em>Fae Farm&nbsp;</em>are ending next month.</figcaption></figure><p>It doesn't seem as though the game is being delisted, either, so you should still be able to buy&nbsp;<em>Fae Farm&nbsp;</em>if you don't already own it.</p>

<p>The end of&nbsp;<em>Fae Farm&nbsp;</em>updates comes after Phoenix Labs <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dauntless-developer-phoenix-labs-more-layoffs" rel="nofollow">laid off "the majority" of its staff</a> earlier this year, a move the studio referred to as "unfortunate but necessary changes to our operations" at the time.</p>

<p>That decision followed the release of an update for monster-hunting RPG&nbsp;<em>Dauntless&nbsp;</em>by the name of Awakening, which <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dauntless-awakening-update-apology" rel="nofollow">proved hugely unpopular with players</a> and caused the game's player base to dwindle. The failure of Awakening also led Phoenix Labs to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dauntless-shutting-down-in-may" rel="nofollow">shut down <i>Dauntless&nbsp;</i>in May</a>.</p>

<p>Given that&nbsp;<em>Dauntless&nbsp;</em>has closed down and that updates for&nbsp;<em>Fae Farm&nbsp;</em>are ending, it's not too difficult to extrapolate that Phoenix Labs itself might be about to close down. It certainly wouldn't be the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/perfect-dark-reboot-canceled-developer-shut-down" rel="nofollow">only studio</a> to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/echtra-games-shut-down-torchlight-3" rel="nofollow">do so this year</a>, unfortunately.</p>




<p>If you've yet to check out&nbsp;<em>Fae Farm</em>, you can pick it up right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2230110/Fae_Farm/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10010439" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/fae-farm/9N0QS2277QHF" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/fae-farm-switch/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch</a>, and you can <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/fae-farm-review-little-bit-of-magic" rel="nofollow">read our review right here</a>.</p>

<p>Gamescom 2025 is right around the corner, so expect a huge surge of reveals and details on some of the biggest upcoming games. If you want to know exactly what to expect, we’ve got you covered.</p>



<p>With E3 dead and gone, Gamescom is the ultimate annual event for gaming fans to soak up the latest news and get their hands on huge titles ahead of launch, and 2025 is shaping up to be a huge year.</p>



<p>From the biggest AAA titles to indie games to keep an eye out for, we’ve highlighted everything announced for Gamescom 2025 in this guide.</p>







<figure><figcaption>Opening Night Live will showcase huge games. Image via Gamescom</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Games set to headline Gamescom 2025 include Call of Duty: Black Ops 7, Hollow Knight: Silksong, EA FC 26, and lots more—with surprises also set to feature.</strong></p>



<p>The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gamescom-opening-night-live-2025-start-date-times-how-to-watch-how-long-is-it/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gamescom Opening Night Live event</a> will be stacked full of trailers, first-look exclusives, gameplay showcases, and special guests. This includes the reveal for <strong><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-reveal-happening-at-gamescom-opening-night-live/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Ops 7</a></strong>, the opening cinematic from <strong><a href="https://x.com/geoffkeighley/status/1954528805269221431" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">World of Warcraft: Midnight</a>, </strong>and gameplay from <strong><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/resident-evil-requiem-gameplay-opening-night-live/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Resident Evil: Requiem</a>.</strong></p>



<p>With over 1500 exhibitors at the event, there is no shortage of things to look out for, though perhaps the most in-demand will be the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hollow-knight-silksong-playable-demo-confirmed-by-xbox-for-gamescom-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">playable demo of <strong>Hollow Knight: Silksong</strong></a><strong>. </strong>Both Microsoft and Nintendo have announced playable demos on their hardware, the former including the new ROG Ally.</p>



<p>Konami announced that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/silent-hill-f-gamescom/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">both <strong>Silent Hill F </strong>and <strong>Metal Gear Solid: Snake Eater </strong>will be at Gamescom</a>, while other partners in attendance include <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gamescom-first-wave-of-partners-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ubisoft and Capcom</a>. Nintendo also <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-returns-to-gamescom-in-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced its attendance</a>, having skipped Gamescom in 2025, with the Switch 2 set to be a highlight.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, <strong>EA FC 26 </strong>is among the titles that will be playable at Gamescom, with EA Sports ramping up marketing ahead of the worldwide release in September.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">If you’re one of the Nintendo fans who worried the company lost its creative spark after playing it fairly safe with the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-review">Switch 2</a>, let me introduce you to Drag x Drive: a wheelchair basketball-inspired sports game that’s controlled almost entirely with the Joy-Con 2’s mouse mode. True, it’s surprisingly drab in personality considering it comes from the company that’s brought us some of the most iconic characters and worlds in gaming, but even after 20 years of playing every bizarre motion-controlled game from the Wii on down, I can safely say this is something I’ve never seen before. Perhaps more surprising to hear, I actually really like how Drag x Drive plays. I respect the ambition to try something entirely new, even though I recognize the result is definitely not going to be for everyone. But despite its surprisingly good gameplay, Drag x Drive is pretty disappointing in terms of the content outside of its three-on-three online matches, with a lack of variety and enticing unlockables you’d expect from a game like this. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">From the look of it, the main reason this game exists is to showcase the Joy-Con 2’s combination of built-in mouse and motion controls. The separated left and right controllers direct your baller’s left and right arm, respectively; you can slide the controller on a flat surface to have your arm push your wheels forward and backward, lift and flick your wrist after you line yourself up with the hoop to shoot the ball, and wave to a teammate to signal that you’re open for a pass. Drag x Drive plays like a more hardcore version of a game in the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2006/11/14/wii-sports-review">Wii Sports</a> series: it’s less pick-up-and-play, with more advanced techniques to master and the added demand of constantly sliding your controllers around. If you hate Wii-era motion controls or any game that leaves your arms and wrists a little bit tired after extended play sessions, you should probably stay far away from this one.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Drag X Drive Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">For the first hour or so, it didn’t feel natural. It demands a lot of actions a game has never asked of me before: usually games like Wii Sports rely on simple controls paired with automatic movement, but Drag x Drive puts you in complete control of your character, and I just wasn’t used to it. And when things weren’t going well, like when my opponent kept scoring and I hadn’t yet learned how to stop it, the physicality of it all made for a steeper, more frustrating learning curve than just remembering which buttons to press on a traditional controller (an option that is entirely absent here).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But as I practiced further, I started to really enjoy the way Drag x Drive plays. Once I absorbed the idea, I started comfortably gliding around the lone arena that combines a traditional basketball court with skate park elements, stealing the ball from opponents and then dunking it after doing a flip off a halfpipe. Drag x Drive’s skill ceiling feels surprisingly high, and I can see a hardcore group really latching onto its systems. The mid-match action is very polished as well, with rock-solid performance and cool haptic feedback where you can feel the click of your wheels in the controllers.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>It’s generally very responsive, if<em> </em>you have a proper surface to play on.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s generally very responsive, too, <em>if </em>you have a proper surface to play on. That’s a big “if” – never before have I had to undergo so many wardrobe changes to figure out which pants were ideal to wear when playing a video game. Nintendo says you can use your legs for the mouse controls, but the results really varied depending on if I was wearing jeans, pajama bottoms, cotton sweatpants, or athletic shorts, which ended up working the best. Any texture, wrinkles, or folds impacted motion accuracy, and if I wasn’t sitting with my legs perfectly flat like a tabletop, it sometimes wouldn’t register that I was trying to move at all. It takes some work to achieve the best position to play, but once I found it, the controls did work significantly better than I expected.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you have the option, though, don’t use your lap. Drag x Drive easily worked the best when playing in my office on my desktop PC monitor, which is where I settled after finding that leaning over a living room coffee table wasn’t comfortable enough either. I simply moved my keyboard aside and had the entire flat surface of my desk to slam the Joy-Con 2 on over and over (I will say, the idea of being this rough with controllers that keep going up in price made me feel a little uneasy).</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">If you manage to get past those initial road blocks, you can start learning some neat tricks to score bonus points. You can pull off a bunny hop as you shoot the ball to score an extra tenth of a point – which is a leap you perform by grabbing your wheels and lifting both controllers up in quick succession. A flashy 540-degree turn that leads into a two-handed slam dunk is worth .4 extra points, and it’s really satisfying trying to get an opening to pull off these risky, advanced techniques – and I had multiple games come down to a fraction of a point difference. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Defense is pretty fun, too: you need to slam into a ball-handling opponent head-on to knock it loose, literally put your hands in the air to try and block a shot, or quickly snag a rebound to regain possession. I learned how important it is to hit the brakes to stop directly in front of an opponent and get up in their face. It accurately replicates the intensity and excitement of a close pickup game, with great moments like grabbing a rebound and driving all the way down the court for an open three, or throwing up a last-second buzzer beater, complete with a dramatic slow motion effect.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">You <em>can</em> play offline with bots that are decently smart and always pass you the ball if you signal that you’re open, but the action excels when you take it online with five friends or strangers. It’s fun to coordinate with teammates over GameChat to set them up for an open shot or decide who to guard on defense – and like most competitive multiplayer games of this nature, there’s really no reason to play offline.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Sadly, outside of the arena, Drag x Drive doesn’t have much going on. The whole affair takes place in what’s called the Park, which has about as much personality as its one-word name implies. It has the same color palette and atmosphere you’d expect from a mall parking lot, with gray concrete everywhere, faint, forgettable music off in the distance, and nobody around (unless you’re playing online, where up to 12 people can join a Park together). Scattered around are a small handful of fun time-based challenges, like racing through obstacle courses, jumping rope 100 times in a row, or scoring as many points as possible, but after reaching the target time for most of them in just a couple of hours, I was left wishing there were more challenges to complete. </p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="title3">Logan Ranks Every First-Party Switch 2 Game</h3><p>Follow this list for my ranking of every Nintendo-published Switch 2 game from the very start of the generation.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">One neat idea is that if you’re playing in an online lobby and roaming around the Park trying out challenges at your own pace, a giant video board displays live updates of who has the highest scores in each one. Some challenges award gold rings to the record-holder so everyone wheeling around the park can see who’s the champ. Both features encourage friendly competition if you all buy into it, and I can see this being a decently fun place to hang out with a group of friends as everyone tries to set new high scores in between matches. There are also group minigames to break things up, though those amount to a 30-second race or a sprint to see who can grab the ball first. They’re both pretty skippable, and fortunately, you can easily opt out of participating and just wait for the real game to begin.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The big issue holding Drag x Drive back is that there’s just not that much reason to do anything. Earning trophies by winning games and completing challenges unlocks new helmet designs for your character, but that’s pretty much the only unlockable, and the customization options honestly aren’t that exciting when it’s all just helmets with one or two minor differences, like bunny ears or a spiky hairdo. There’s no leveling up, no meaningful achievements, and nothing to work toward that makes me want to boot up Drag x Drive when I could be playing <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mario-kart-world-review">Mario Kart</a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/splatoon-3-multiplayer-review">Splatoon</a>, or another competitive multiplayer game. I don’t necessarily think a game <em>needs</em> this stuff to be fun, but after 10 hours, I’m skeptical I’ll have much reason to come back outside of friend hangouts. And that’s only if my friends put in the time to click with the gameplay like I have.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>It’s a shame that gameplay I genuinely like is wrapped in such a boring, one-note package.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Even things like a varied soundtrack, multiple court designs, or original characters with personalities (like in Arms and Splatoon) would go a long way here, but instead it all just feels like the bare minimum. It’s incredibly generic, and it’s a shame that gameplay I genuinely like is wrapped in such a boring, one-note package. That’s not usually Nintendo’s style.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It also has to be said that it’s ironic how, in a game that’s clearly based on wheelchair basketball, there’s no option to play with anything but these physically demanding motion controls, and the settings to adjust how they work are extremely limited. It’s not exactly a poster child for accessibility in video games.</p></section><div data-cy="verdict"><h3 data-cy="title3">Verdict</h3><p data-cy="article-verdict-paragraph">Drag x Drive controls like nothing else I’ve ever played, and it asks a lot of you in order to get used to its complicated mouse and motion mechanics. Obviously, if you don't like (or literally can’t use) forced motion controls like this, then you should steer clear. But once I put in the time to "get good," I really enjoyed the surprisingly deep fundamentals of Nintendo's unique take on wheelchair basketball. Its online three-on-three matches are a lot of fun, and it has some good ideas for provoking friendly competition between rounds that I wish were fleshed out a little bit more. That lack of substance is the most disappointing part about Drag x Drive, with little in the way of unlockables, customization, personality, and variety. I imagine a hardcore group of fans could rally around it, because its movement is very cool and there is a ton of potential to discover in its exciting trick system – but with a high initial barrier to entry and not enough reasons to stick around for the long haul once you’ve cleared it, it’s hard to see Drag x Drive establishing itself among an already crowded field of online multiplayer options.</p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/drag-x-drive-review]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">"We are not retconning what we have done in the past."</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">The <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/assassins-creed-shadows">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> development team has answered fan questions on the future of the franchise's modern day storyline, as well as various lingering plot threads left unanswered in the series' recent blockbuster.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Shadows is designed as something of a soft reboot for the series, with no playable modern day section and a strong focus on the real-life historical elements found in its version of feudal Japan. Little mention is made of events from previous games — something that ensures new players don't feel like they need to head to Wikipedia and catch up.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The game's story reintroduces the Assassins and Templars slowly, and makes no mention of Basim — a major character seen within Assassin's Creed Valhalla and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/assassins-creed-mirage">Assassin's Creed Mirage</a> whose fate is left open-ended. The Isu, Assassin's Creed's mysterious precursor race, meanwhile do not play a part at all — following a string of games where the hunt for one of their artefacts acted as the main macguffin. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Now, during a fan Q&amp;A on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/assassinscreed/comments/1mo3rmj/hi_were_simon_andr%C3%A9_and_luc_developers_on/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reddit</a>, the game's development team has answered questions regarding whether the series will deliver more modern day storyline in the future, whether we'll see Basim again, and which of the game's current crossovers are canon.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"With AC Shadows we are putting in place the first stone of new means to deliver the modern day storyline with the Animus Hub," wrote level design director Luc Plante. "That is not the end of it, and we are listening to your feedback."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Currently, fans can unlock snippets of text logs that tell a fresh story featuring various Assassin and Templar units in what seems to be the near future. So, technically, rather than the "modern day", this storytelling time period now appears to be a number of decades ahead (and something that conveniently means ongoing plot threads like the character of Basim can be moved past).</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The Complete Assassin's Creed Timeline</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">But will fans get more of Basim's story? Valhalla's ending left the character's future wide open, with many fans expecting him to appear again in a prominent role. Mirage, which tells the story of his origins, meanwhile once featured a bizarre post-credits scene hinting at more from the game set to come. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We have complex new characters that were introduced in Shadows that we didn't feel there would have been enough spotlight for Basim as well," Plante continued.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Could Basim's story be picked up in Shadows? It seems unlikely. The character feels too far removed from the game's Japanese storyline, and it's easy to see why Ubisoft did not have a place for him in the game. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">At the same time, it's worth remembering that Ubisoft declined to comment earlier this year on a report in a French newspaper that stated the company was now working on new content for Mirage, following an injection of funding from Saudi Arabia's controversial Public Investment Fund. Perhaps this, if and when it arrives, will be used to wrap up Basim's narrative.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"The AC lore is very complex and keep expending as we are creating new games," Plante said, when asked why events in the franchise's expanded universe of games and comics were not mentioned specifically within Shadows. "We are not retconning what we have done in the past, but we do not necessarily mention everything in every game if it doesn't directly support the narrative we are building. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Ubisoft has taken a similar approach to the Isu, who remained off-screen within the game. Assassin's Creed Odyssey and Valhalla leant heavily into their settings' mythological elements. Shadows, however, treated (almost) everything without the need for a supernatural or sci-fi explanation.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Similar to this, the fact that there is no Isu artifact in the main game of Shadows doesn't mean that it doesn't exist in the world of Shadows," Plante said, "it just wasn't a story device that we needed for the story we wanted to tell." </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking of supernatural elements, Plante confirmed Shadows' unlockable Dead by Daylight content was "not canon to the story of Shadows." That said, the recent Critical Role crossover with the new character of Rufino <em>is</em> canon, and tied into the game's main themes. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Next up for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-expansion-claws-of-awaji-release-date-revealed">Assassin's Creed Shadows is the game's big Claws of Awaji expansion</a>, due on September 16. Alongside a fresh region to explore, the add-on will expand on Shadows' current ending with new story for Naoe and Yasuke. Maybe the Isu are lurking somewhere within it?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

Humanity breathed a collective sigh of relief, but this was short-lived when in 2164 unidentified objects fell from the sky, followed electronic weapons systems running amok, and culminating in an ‘annihilation unit’ stored alongside the R9 suddenly going berserk, descending to Earth and beginning a wave of destruction.

The much-loved soundtrack has received a refresh, with newly-arranged compositions from <a title="Companies > Mas [1 article]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/mas">Mas</a>ahiko Ishida (<em>R-Type II</em>), as well as USP (<em>R-Type Delta</em>) and Chris Hulsbeck (<em>R-Type</em> for C64 and Amiga).

                <p>PUBG publisher Krafton's Sims-like InZoi is headed to PS5 in 2026. The developer <a href="https://x.com/PlayinZOI/status/1955436672444928385" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">announced today</a> that InZoi will be released on Sony's console next year, but the company didn't have a specific release date to share, nor did it have information to reveal about an Xbox release.</p><p>The studio said an Xbox release is "under consideration, but not yet confirmed." You can <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10013711/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">wishlist the game now on the PlayStation Store.</a></p><p>A life-simulation game, InZoi has players controlling "Zois" as as they shape their lives and personal experiences in the world.</p><p>InZoi was released on PC in March this year for $40 as a Steam Early Access title. The game uses AI-generated content for a variety of purposes, including creating 3D objects from image input.</p><p>The game peaked at more than 87,000 concurrent users on Steam back in March but has since <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2456740/charts/#max" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">declined to around 1,000 peak concurrent daily players.</a> InZoi Studios is hoping to see its player numbers jump again when the first DLC, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3887680/inZOI__Island_Getaway/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Island Getaway</a>, launches on August 20.

                <p>The saga of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/subnautica-2/" data-ref-id="5000-647677">Subnautica 2</a> has played out in the court of public opinion this summer, and now it's taken another step towards an actual courtroom. Krafton has officially responded <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/former-subnautica-2-devs-file-lawsuit-against-krafton/1100-6533107/" data-ref-id="1100-6533107">to the lawsuit filed by Unknown Worlds co-founders</a> Charlie Cleveland and Max McGuire, as well as former CEO Ted Gill--all three of whom were <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/former-subnautica-2-director-says-the-game-is-ready-for-early-access-release/1100-6533016/" data-ref-id="1100-6533016">forced out of the studio</a>.</p><p>Cleveland and his team have accused Krafton of delaying Subnautica 2 in order to prevent the publisher from paying Unknown Worlds <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/subnautica-2-delay-may-cost-studio-250-million-bonus-report/1100-6533069/" data-ref-id="1100-6533069">a $250 million performance bonus</a>. Via <a href="https://kotaku.com/subnautica-2-krafton-lawsuit-unknonw-worlds-delay-steam-2000617210" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Kotaku</a>, Krafton's response accuses the co-founders of valuing the $250 million bonus over delivering a more complete version of Subnautica 2. The filing goes even further and states that the co-founders were fired to prevent them "from permanently damaging Unknown Worlds' most valuable IP, the company itself, and its goodwill with its fans."</p><p>The $250 million bonus was supposed to be paid out to Unknown Worlds if the company met certain financial goals in 2025, which would be almost impossible if Subnautica 2 doesn't get an early-access release this year. After fans <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/subnautica-fans-are-calling-for-a-subnautica-2-boycott/1100-6533092/" data-ref-id="1100-6533092">openly called for a boycott of Subnautica 2</a>, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-07-15/krafton-extends-subnautica-2-bonus-period-is-sued-by-founders" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Bloomberg</a> reported that Krafton has extended the bonus period into next year to allow the Unknown Worlds team a better chance of meeting those benchmarks and earning $25 million to be split among 40 employees. The remaining $225 million of the bonus would have gone to the former leadership team.</p><p>Krafton's complete <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/900707287/Defendant-s-Answer-to-Verified-Complaint?secret_password=ha0mUjTuK1JQkOU4QaYn" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">response to the lawsuit is online</a>, and it paints a picture of the co-founders attempting to rush Subnautica 2 into early access while simultaneously remaining hands-off on the actual production. The filing also states that, "Krafton had invested $500 million in the success of not only Subnautica 2, but also Subnautica 3, Subnautica 4, and any other future Subnautica franchise product."</p><p>Subnautica 2 is currently set to have its early-access release in 2026 on PC and Xbox Series X|S.</p>

                <p>There were some severe consequences for BioWare last year when <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/dragon-age-the-veilguard-review/1900-6418294/" data-ref-id="1900-6418294">Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a> stumbled out of the gate and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-report-sheds-light-on-why-dragon-age-the-veilguard-failed/1100-6532366/" data-ref-id="1100-6532366">failed to meet EA's sales expectations</a>. EA <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/after-dragon-age-the-veilguard-comes-up-short-bioware-undergoes-changes/1100-6529105/" data-ref-id="1100-6529105">laid off a lot of BioWare's staff</a> and left a much smaller team working on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mass-effect-5-everything-we-know-about-bioware-upcoming-rpg/1100-6485779/" data-ref-id="1100-6485779">the next Mass Effect game</a>. But there may be a silver lining to that, according to former BioWare employee Mark Darrah.</p><p>Darrah--who served as an executive producer on the first three Dragon Age games before leaving BioWare--recently joined <a href="https://youtu.be/1Pd9OG3HmN0" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">MrMattyPlays on YouTube</a> and shared his belief that the remaining BioWare devs should "scapegoat" The Veilguard to get every resource they need from EA.</p><p>"To be frank, the Mass Effect team is going to be able to point to The Veilguard and say, 'We should steer away from some of these things, because look what happened,'" said Darrah. "I would honestly encourage that team to scapegoat Veilgard as much as they need to to get what they need from the organization, whether it's true or not."</p><p>During the same interview, Darrah recalled that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dragon-age-trilogy-was-rejected-by-ea-says-former-bioware-employee/1100-6533843/" data-ref-id="1100-6533843">BioWare attempted to get a Dragon Age trilogy remaster off the ground</a>, but didn't get a favorable response from EA. The Veilguard went through a difficult development <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-report-sheds-light-on-why-dragon-age-the-veilguard-failed/1100-6532366/" data-ref-id="1100-6532366">that included a shift to a live-service model</a> before it was redeveloped as a single-player game. Former BioWare employees have also said that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/veilguard-and-mass-effect-teams-didnt-get-along-at-bioware-dragon-age-creator-says/1100-6530858/" data-ref-id="1100-6530858">the Dragon Age and Mass Effect teams didn't get along</a>.</p><p>Mass Effect producer Mike Gamble recently teased that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mass-effect-5-will-carry-over-a-piece-of-the-series-signature-style-apparently/1100-6532042/" data-ref-id="1100-6532042">the next game will maintain the series' signature lens flare</a>.

            <p>Speaking to Eurogamer, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/tekken-8">Tekken 8</a> director Katsuhiro Harada (via translation from designer Michael Murray) stated a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-nintendo-switch-2-the-digital-foundry-hardware-review">Switch 2</a> port of the 3D fighting game could happen, but it'll be a costly endeavour.</p>
<p>In an interview at Evo earlier this month, Harada stated: "It's an interesting option, and not totally off the table. But it would require a lot of work on the game to get it running on that hardware."</p>
<p>Harada continued: "From a business standpoint, [the Switch 2] is doing quite well, so it would be a very good business decision if you're trying to get a bigger audience. But the amount of work that would have to be done on the game makes it not a very easy decision. At this point in time, there are no… (laughs) There is nothing to announce."</p>

<p>Perhaps a launch on the Switch 2 would be a good thing for Tekken 8. The game is currently mired in controversy thanks to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tekken-8-receives-emergency-patch-in-response-to-season-two-balancing-backlash">a series of new changes</a> that have been implemented as part of both Seasons 2 and 3 of the game. The reception on returning Muay Thai specialist Fahkumram has been mixed, though the fan barometer seems to have improved slightly with the reveal of Armor King. Newcomer Miary Zo has split the fanbase somewhat, too, although there appears to be more to the Malagasy teenager than meets the eye (current fan theories point to her being some sort of vessel for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/tekken-3">Tekken 3</a>’s Ogre…) A release on new hardware to a more casual audience could be good for the game, and Harada has previously spoken at length about <a href="https://x.com/Harada_TEKKEN/status/1760182225143009473?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1760182225143009473%7Ctwgr%5Ea4d3d2e1be924ba8754cd1486aa9e2204e4e3130%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.redditmedia.com%2Fmediaembed%2F1b1wup2%2F%3Fresponsive%3Dtrueis_nightmode%3Dfalse">Tekken 8 needs to recoup a lot of money</a> in order for the series to have <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tekkens-harada-isnt-worried-about-his-future-absence-damaging-the-series-wont-be-hard-to-continue-with-someone-else">a future</a>.</p><p>As for the Switch 2, the platform has proven an interesting destination for fighting games. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/street-fighter-6">Street Fighter 6</a> launched on the Switch 2 alongside the console's release back in June. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-street-fighter-6-on-switch-2-classic-60fps-action-with-better-image-quality-than-xbox-series-s">It's a good port that holds its own against other versions on the PS5, PC, and Xbox</a>. Plus, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/street-fighter-6-sells-five-million-copies-on-track-to-be-best-selling-street-fighter-ever">it contributed to the file million sales milestone for Capcom's latest 2D fighter</a>.</p>
<p>Not only is the Switch 2 a popular new console, its portability offers interesting opportunities for genres with an inherent social component. Fighting games are - and have always been - best played with others. Slapping down a Switch 2 at an airport or local meet-up and getting some games in is a lovely little value add for those games who make the leap. Here's hoping Tekken 8 manages it.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>PUBG’s time on Xbox One and PlayStation 4 will be coming to an end in November with a transition to current-generation consoles, it has been announced.</p>



<p>As previously announced in the 2025 roadmap, preparations have been made to move the console version of PUBG onto current-gen consoles. Unfortunately for those on last-gen devices, it means an end to official support.</p>



<p>Players on Xbox Series X|S and PlayStation 5 will benefit from improved visuals, more stable frame rates, and reduced crashes. However, the headline is undoubtedly the end of support for last-gen consoles.</p>



<h2 id="h-pubg-moving-to-current-gen-in-november">PUBG Moving to Current-Gen in November</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>Announced on the <a href="https://pubg.com/en/news/9005" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">official website</a>, PUBG will no longer be playable or available to download on Xbox One and PlayStation 4 on <strong>November 13, 2025.</strong></p>



<p>The end for the platforms will come following live server maintenance on the above date, though the schedule is subject to change depending on the review process for each platform.</p>



<p>It has been confirmed that existing account data and purchased items will be “securely preserved,” with players having the ability to log into the game on PS5 or Xbox Series X|S at any time after the change to continue playing on an existing account—with no separate transfer required.</p>



<p>While Xbox Series X|S players will have their version upgraded via the platform’s Smart Delivery process on November 13, PS5 players are required to download the new PS5 version of PUBG from the PlayStation Store when the update is live.</p>



<p>In the announcement, it was added that a goal of “fairness across all platforms” is a major priority, with the intention to provide a stable 60fps experience across all platforms. To enable this, the Xbox Series S will have selectable options of a Resolution Mode and a Performance Mode.</p>



<p>Is the move to current-gen consoles long overdue for PUBG? Let us know your thoughts in the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/threads/3293/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>The second weekend of the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/battlefield-6">Battlefield 6</a> open beta is getting bigger, with the addition of two game modes and one of the most eye-catching maps for players to duke it out in.</p>
<p>The second <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/07/31/battlefield-6-launches-10th-october-see-the-multiplayer-trailer-beta-reveal-here/">Battlefield 6 open beta weekend</a> will take place from 14th-17th August, and with no restrictions on who can download and play across PS5, Xbox Series X|S or PC.</p>


<p>After the booming popularity of the first weekend, DICE are expanding what’s on offer in the second weekend with the addition of Rush and Squad Deathmatch modes, as well as adding in the Empire State map, which takes place in New York near to the Brooklyn Bridge. This is in addition to all the maps and modes that were previously available.</p>

<p>The first weekend saw millions of people dive in to check out Battlefield 6, with <a href="https://steamcharts.com/app/3081410">SteamCharts tracking over 500,000 players at its peak</a>, and many, many more across other platforms and storefronts. So popular was the beta that server queues were put in place to manage the game’s load.</p>

<p>Officially unveiled last month, Battlefield 6 is a huge production for EA, with the Battlefield Studios comprised of Criterion, DICE, Ripple Effect and Motive Studios, all with different roles to play in its creation. Criterion and Motive have focused on the single player campaign, which will see NATO attacked and going on the counter-offensive against the private military group known as Pax Armata, and these set out the two sides for the multiplayer as well, with settings that will range from the Middle East through Europe and to the US mainland.</p>
<p>There will be 9 maps at launch, while Conquest, Rush and Breakthrough game modes are joined by the likes of TDM, Squad DM, Domination and KOTH, and more will be added through seasonal updates. Classes are also back alongside ‘signature’ weapons and abilities that fit into the archetypes of games before Battlefield 2042, though there’s a smidgeon of simmering controversy from the default game having a free weapon choice instead of class-locked weapons.</p>
<p>Regardless, the first beta weekend has proven to be exceptionally popular, and EA and the Battlefield Studios will be hoping to ride that wave through to the game’s launch on 10th October.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>Nintendo truly are the masters of the controller gimmick, from the dual screens of the DS and Wii U, to the waggling motion controls of the Wii, and detachable Switch Joy-Con. Each one has come with first party games that really showcase their use, and for the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/04/nintendo-switch-2s-joy-con-mouse-mode-is-a-literal-game-changer/">Joy-Con 2’s optical sensors and mouse mode</a>, that game is <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/drag-x-drive">Drag x Drive</a>.</p>
<p><iframe title="Drag x Drive Review – More like&nbsp;Drab x Dunk" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5cvF2berYT4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Drag x Drive is all about pick up games of wheelchair basketball, with teams of three and the core rules of basketball like the 3-point line rewarding longer shots and a shot clock forcing you to use the ball within 14 seconds all preserved here.</p>


<p>Playing the game requires that you unclip the Joy-Con 2 from your console and then use them as mice, tipping them so the optical sensor faces a tabletop or trouser leg to track your motion inputs. Pushing forward along the surface with your hands pushes your character forward with the corresponding wheel, and it quickly becomes generally intuitive to race forward, turn through corners and navigate the play space, accompanied by a neat ratcheting click effect from the HD Rumble. The triggers then pull the brakes for a quick stop, and can be used on one side for a rapid spin and pivot.</p>


<p>Coming into contact with the ball grabs it and puts it on your character’s lap while you manoeuvre, trying to avoid head-on collisions that will knock the ball loose as you head to the opposing team’s hoop, and there’s a quick and easy pass by tapping both shoulder buttons. Taking a shot, though, relies on motion controls. Pull up your hand and flick in the direction to send the ball flying, with more accuracy coming from the direction you’re facing, speed your going, and distance it has to travel to score.</p>
<p>Extra decimal points come from pulling off a shot with a bit of flair, and there’s a handful of quick tricks that you can pull. There’s quarter pipe ramps at either end of the court that you can use to launch yourself up and go for a dunk –&nbsp;easier said than done –&nbsp;or you can hop up in the air by pulling both brakes and yanking your hands up one after another.</p>

<p>It all combines for some quick and pithy wheelchair basketball action with bitesized three-minute matches. There’s plenty to master here, like the perfect angle to go for a dunk, and it’s difficult to feel truly precise in your actions, to get the subtle turns that you need. Team play could also be rewarded with quick passing getting around a defence, but the end-to-end nature of basketball is definitely here.</p>
<p>The game is wrapped up by the Park, a shared play space for both public and private lobbies. This has a lot of the appearance of a skate park, and it’s littered with challenges to help you learn the controls. There’s races, cone slaloms, obstacle courses, shot challenges, ramp time trials and more. The general matchmaking will mix and match players in a lobby into teams – filling in an AI if there’s an odd number –&nbsp;while matches are broken up with a couple shared minigames. You have preferences to let you engage with or avoid these, as you like, but you can also disconnect and take to the Park solo to practice against bots. That’s the extent of the single player in this game, though.</p>

<p>What’s most surprising about Drag x Drive is just how dour the game’s visuals are. The Park is a grungy, grey warehouse of an arena, and all of the characters default to black and grey clothes, helmets and wheelchairs. Yes, there is colour from the paint inside the 3-point line, around the side of the courts, and from spotlights, and yes, you can change your avatar’s outfit to have different colours, but they’re muted at best, and the overriding memory you’ll have of this game is as grey as the Xbox 360 era was brown.</p>
<p>There’s also a lack of unlockables and cosmetics. Almost everything is available from the off, outside of some helmet designs that are unlocked with challenges. There’s just no personality when everyone is a blank helmeted figure, and that’s a massive gulf between Drag x Drive and the colourful, vibrancy of an ARMS or Splatoon, let alone all of the cosmetics and customisation of Rocket League.</p>

<p>The other aspect is the instant gratification gaming that Drag x Drive can’t quite match. Where ARMS was all about using motion controls for punching, it had the button controls as a fallback, but you don’t have that option with Drag x Drive, so you can’t curl up on the sofa or lie in bed and play. More than that, when wheelchair athletes are at the centre of this game, having motion controls as the only option means that this isn’t really accessible for gamers with certain kinds of limited mobility. That’s disappointing.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/review-drag-x-drive-switch-2-a-real-baller-with-friends-but-is-there-enough-to-do.1268856/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/drag-x-drive">Drag x Drive</a> is Nintendo's latest attempt to give us a unique sports game that utilises their latest console's flashy tech. And this time, it isn't just any old sport. If you've ever watched wheelchair basketball, you know how technical it can get, and Drag x Drive takes this to the extreme.</p>
<p>It's a brilliant choice of sport to bring to life with Mouse Mode controls, and one that's been carried off with plenty of skill. The main issue is your mileage is going to vary based on how you get on with these controls. I'm not just talking about their implementation in the actual game; things like how thin (and slightly uncomfortable) the Joy-Con 2 are when on their side, how your wrists fare generally, and what sort of surface or space you're playing with, all come into consideration.</p>

<p>But let's reverse the old wheelchair for a second, and go over what Drag x Drive entails. Nintendo has gone with an arcade-style take on wheelchair basketball, which lends itself well to exciting 3v3 face-offs. Matches are action-packed, three-minute affairs, and there isn't much room on a court so you're always in close proximity to teammates or opponents. There's also a very pleasing dual-layered learning curve that needs to be approached and overcome at the outset.</p>
<p>Simply getting used to playing the actual basketball by timing your runs, making passes, and choosing to play it safe or go for three-point baskets, means there's plenty to take in and have a good time with. Then you have to consider that you're doing all of this in a wheelchair-like vehicle. I'm the type of person who crashes things at precisely the wrong moment (in games, not in real life!), so getting to blast around freely in one of these things at high speeds, well, it's very exciting. And it stays exciting for longer than I thought possible because the controls are good, for the most part.</p>
<p>In practice, playing on a table worked well for a time, but I found using my legs better, as it's way less hard on your hands and arms once I got used to it. It's impressive that the tech manages to keep the controls so smooth whilst I glided over my very un-ironed trousers. Well met, Nintendo.</p>
<figure><a title="Drag x Drive Review - Screenshot 2 of 7" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/157963/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>In Mouse Mode, each Joy-Con pertains to a wheel. For example, to move in a straight line, you need to slide both Joy-Con 2 forward simultaneously, then lift to return your hand to the start position to slide again. It apes the real-life motion of pushing your wheels forward. Smooth and controlled slides help you gain speed, and this is very much a game where timing and grace trump going for big power moves and destroying your furniture and arms. You don't need to break into a sweat, just relax your arms and chill. Then you start adding turns and braking in and, well... let's just say you can make some violently fast changes of direction.</p>
<p>Shooting is much simpler, as you simply need to throw up an arm and motion out a shot, and as long as you're facing the basket, you should make it. There's just enough freedom to also give players ways to be a little stylish with tricks and sexy half pipe dunks. And to defend, you just need to roll back to your half and prep for whatever assault your opponent has in mind, block those lanes and get ready for a tackle. Hit an opponent head-on — doesn't matter the speed (again, you never really need to be brute-forcing anything here), as long as you collide in their face — and the ball will spill out of their hands, which is followed by an animated clamour to nab it back.</p>

<p>There are three player styles to select from: Guard, Forward, or Center, and these have different ability levels split between rebounding, strength and quickness. You also get some customisation slots where you can deck out your little space-person with new helmets, colours, and textures. This part of the game is very basic, however, so don't expect a design studio.</p>
<p>If you want to get <em>really</em> flashy on-court, Drag x Drive has a bunch of OTT video game stuff and tricks, like tilting up onto one wheel by braking on the side you want to tilt to and then lifting your Joy-Con up on that side at the same time. Do this on both sides at the same time, and you'll bunny hop! It's satisfying when you manage to pull these off mid-match, but in my experience, some tricks don't come off smoothly enough. It still works, but you can't rely on it 100%. Which is a shame, because as frustrated as I've been at times trying to put together wheeling, turning, passing, and shooting, I keep coming back for more.</p>

<p>All of this gives you plenty to work with as you launch into 3v3 battles against either human or CPU opponents, with matches housed within an arena that can either be set to Friend or Public Park. This arena is also full of side missions and challenges, most of which are designed to help you master the controls. A handful of extra games, such as a race to the checkpoint or chasing after a ball, pop up between matches to help keep things fresh, though you can choose to opt in or out of them entirely if they aren't your cup of tea.</p>
<p>A few other side missions, such as the slalom and shots against the clock, are perfect for getting the hang of sharp turns and nailing your hoop skills, too. I have to say, as much as I think some will baulk at how little there is in the package in terms of separate modes of play (a single-player campaign would have helped), there's a good amount of game to sink your teeth into for the price in Drag x Drive, <em>if</em> you are down for mastering it all.</p>
<p>Turning to online, and this is where the game really shines on the court. I managed to play a whole bunch of games with the rest of the crew here at Nintendo Life, and it works well. GameChat is smooth sailing, and the basketball itself holds up to scrutiny. When playing online, the host can choose to set up so that 12 people are in the party, split between two 3v3 games happening at the same time on separate courts within the same arena. You can also spectate matches and keep things nice and private by having a code to get into your park.</p>
<figure><a title="Drag x Drive Review - Screenshot 4 of 7" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/157964/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>That being said, don't look for any bells and whistles online (or anywhere else); what you see really is what you get. There are no different match types or ways to mix things up besides those minigames I mentioned. Even worse, perhaps, is that the Public Park lobbies don't allow you to play against random players online with a friend (or friends) in any way, as far as I’ve been able to tell.</p>
<p>In private Friend Park lobbies, of course, there's no issue — and you can share your Park ID with whomever you choose — but it's certainly something to keep in mind. It seems you can't just head online with a friend and take on other humans; it's bots or 1v1. Perhaps they'll add a way to do this later down the line, although Nintendo have their own special way of doing things, as we all know.</p>
<p>Another weak point in terms of options is a lack of control customisation, meaning you're stuck with the mice, which can make jumping in online a little daunting. Not to mention it fully excludes some players from getting involved.</p>
<figure><a title="Drag x Drive Review - Screenshot 5 of 7" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/157965/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Taking everything into consideration, though, and for the not-enormous price point, there's more depth here than I expected. Drag x Drive feels like a proper attempt to give us something fresh, in the same sort of vein as <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/arms">ARMS</a> back on Switch 1. If you get into its groove, you will get your money's worth.</p>
<p>A final word, though, and as someone who rarely complains about awkward controls (I am a master of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/3ds/kid_icarus_uprising">Kid Icarus Uprising</a> on 3DS, after all), even I had to take breaks playing this getting started. My issue isn't so much anything to do with the controls, it's more the physical act of holding the super slim Joy-Con on their side whilst playing. It gets tiring, and for some it's gonna be a real 'NOPE' moment when they start to feel it. I find that, as I relax a bit and don't put so much force into every movement, things get more comfortable, mind. More troublesome is the bunny-hopping and tilting stuff being a little hard to pull off.</p>

<p>In terms of presentation and performance, it all runs absolutely perfectly, that much is nailed down. However, it's a shame Nintendo opted for this strangely barren style. The robots are cute enough, and the unfussy robotic aesthetic is 'fine', but why not give us some more character, or more varied environments?</p>
<p>I can overlook style stuff when the core game is this solid, though. And Drag x Drive is certainly that. In the end, if you have some pals who're into it, and you're willing to master the game, I have no hesitations in recommending this one.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Drag x Drive may lack options with regards to online modes, and its controls take a bit of getting used to. However, if you can give up some time to engaging with this one, if you can get past the barriers in terms of controls and the early frustrations as you find your rhythm, you'll be rewarded with a unique and very well-made sports game that deserves to find an audience of dedicated fans. Add in some pals, and you've got a solid bit of fun for the price.</p></section>

						<h5>Drag x Drive</h5><p><span>August 14, 2025</span>
					</p></div><div>
							<h5>Platform</h5><p><span>Nintendo Switch 2</span>
						</p></div></div></div>			
			<p>New Nintendo consoles tend to launch with a mix of heavy-hitters, like Mario and Zelda, and smaller, quirkier projects designed to show off the system’s unique features. So far, the Nintendo Switch 2 has offered plenty of the former with big games like <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/mario-kart-world/">Mario Kart World</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/donkey-kong-bananza/">Donkey Kong Bananza</a>, but, surprisingly, not really any of those oddball experimental titles. That's about to change with the release of Drag x Drive, a sci-fi-flavored arcade sports game that closely resembles wheelchair basketball and makes use of the mouse functionality and motion controls of the new Joy-Con 2 controllers in ways only Nintendo could dream up.</p>



<p>Is Drag x Drive a superstar display of the Switch 2's unique features? Or is it just... a drag? Roll on for the answer…</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Nintendo may largely avoid the comparison in their marketing, but it’s clear Drag x Drive is inspired by the real-life sport of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wheelchair_basketball">wheelchair basketball</a>, with teams of three taking to the court in wheeled frames for some ballin’ fun. While there are halfpipe-like ramps at either end of the court for you to do tricks on, the playing field is otherwise a more-or-less standard basketball court. Of course, you can sink standard 2- and 3-pointers, but bonus fractions can also be scored for pulling off tricks (a dunk is usually worth 2.2 points, for instance). This is also a full-on contact sport, with players being able to knock the ball out of opponents' hands by crashing into them. Perhaps none of this sounds particularly out there, but I can assure you, Drag x Drive does set itself apart with a truly unique control scheme.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Players use both the left and right Joy-Con 2 controllers in mouse mode, with each basically replicating your avatar's left and right arms. Push both Joy-Cons forward on a flat surface to roll forward, push just the left forward to turn right and just the right to go left. Shooting is a simple matter of lifting up one of the Joy-Cons and making a flicking motion when your avatar is facing the basket. Passing is handled automatically with a push of the L and R buttons. There are also a handful of other moves and tricks, like bunny-hops and halfpipe back flips, that can be pulled off with more advanced manipulation of the Joy-Cons. As mentioned before, manage to score a basket during or shortly after one of these tricks and you may get a few bonus points.</p>



<p>So, the big question -- does Drag x Drive's weird control scheme actually work? Well, <em>sort of</em>. The mouse controls are responsive enough, and with practice, you can get quite good at gliding across the floor to your opponent's basket. You may even be able to pull off the occasional dunk or trick.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Where the controls break down, is when players all pile into a pack near the hoop, knocking into each other and scrambling for the loose ball. Drag x Drive's controls just don't work very well for precise turns and movement and a lot of each 3-minute game consists of players smashing into each other and chasing the ball, which means you’re going to be spending a lot of time frantically sliding your Joy-Cons on your table (or thighs, lap desk, or whatever surface you're using to play) trying to properly situate yourself. In these moments the controls often feel inadequate, frustrating, and frankly, tiring.</p>



<p>The latter is not something to take lightly. After only 20 minutes or so of playing Drag x Drive, I'd start feeling a bit of burn in my arms and after 45 minutes I'd start to feel some real pain in my shoulders. As in, "stop or you might do yourself some damage" pain. And this is coming from someone who's relatively physically able and very aware of the importance of playing games ergonomically due to all the time I spend on reviews. I wasn't hunching, I wasn't unnecessarily stressing my body, but I couldn't find a way to play Drag x Drive that didn't hurt after a while.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>There's definitely some irony in the fact that a game based on wheelchair basketball, a sport created by and for people with disabilities, is so unyielding in its controls, to the point it will be inaccessible for some. Unfortunately, the game's options menu doesn't provide any relief -- the one quirky control scheme Nintendo has devised is all you get, take it or leave it.</p>



<p>All that said, make no mistake, there <em>are </em>moments of fun to be had playing Drag x Drive. Basketball is fun! Basketball with tackling and tricks is even more fun! I could see a more developed version of Nintendo's take on wheelchair basketball, with more control options, being something worth building around. Unfortunately, that version of Drag x Drive doesn't exist.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>In addition to its control scheme, Drag x Drive also stands out for its unusually heavy focus on online play for a Nintendo game. Everything in Drag x Drive revolves around Parks, which act as social hubs for friends or matchmade randos to hang out in while you wait for enough players to accumulate for a proper game. There are a couple of minigames you can engage in while hanging around -- a basic race and a ball-chase scramble -- which are mildly diverting, but definitely don't outshine the core basketball action.&nbsp;</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>There are some offline activities you can engage in while hanging around the Park, including games against nine levels of AI opponents and a series of timed challenges. The latter can actually be fairly tricky and compelling in short bursts, and completing them will unlock extra cosmetic choices for your avatar. That said, while not totally non-existent, Drag x Drive’s single-player content is nothing to get overly excited about.</p>



<p>Also nothing to get excited about is Drag x Drive's presentation, which is oddly lifeless, lacking any of the color, character, or general pizzazz you usually expect from first-party Nintendo games. At least the game runs well I suppose, although it would be fairly shocking if it didn't given the simplicity of its presentation.</p>



<figure><p>

</p></figure>



<p>Of course, Drag x Drive will only set you back 20 bucks, but given the game's lack of content and general blandness, even that may be too rich for some folks' blood. Beyond the simple question of content, I'm skeptical the heavily-centered online component of this game will be viable for long. Even during the free Drag x Drive demo, a time when there was more people trying the game out than there may ever be in the future, there was often a shortage of players to fill out games, resulting in me getting stuck in 2-on-2 contests. Perhaps the game will find a dedicated audience, but I’m not sure I see it surviving into overtime.</p>

				<p>Drag x Drive delivers some moments of frenetic multiplayer fun, but an inflexible and physically-demanding control scheme, lack of personality, and dearth of content severely limits the game's long-term appeal. Drag x Drive could have been a solid addition to a larger Wii-Sports-style collection designed to show off the Switch 2's mouse functionality, but on its own, the game is far from a slam-dunk purchase.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Yesterday, Ukrainian developer GSC Game World has <a href="https://x.com/stalker_thegame/status/1955298424649080992" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">unveiled</a> the roadmap of updates coming to STALKER 2 for the remainder of 2025. Chief among them is the engine upgrade to Unreal Engine 5.4, which should deliver performance improvements, but new missions and anomalies are also on the way, as well as improvements to the <a href="https://wccftech.com/stalker-2-gets-big-1-5-patch-fixing-a-life-and-adding-mod-tools/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">modding tools</a>.</p>



<ul>
<li>Engine update to Unreal Engine 5.4 (for optimization)</li>



<li>Various night vision devices</li>



<li>Binoculars</li>



<li>A-Life updates: various technical improvements, NPCs can't see in the dark as well as before, NPC combat updates, Mutants combat and balance updates</li>



<li>New anomalies</li>



<li>New missions, from old and new friends</li>



<li>New weather scenario</li>



<li>Master difficulty preset</li>



<li>Extended day/night cycle</li>



<li>Stashes loot rework</li>



<li>Stamina and energy drinks rework</li>



<li>Immersive display mode</li>



<li>Player equipment UI update</li>



<li>More UI updates and improvements</li>



<li>Local save backup restoration</li>



<li>Further optimization and anomalies fixing</li>



<li>Zone Kit - Phase 1 to Phase 2: audio modding (Wwise), narrative tools, improved compatibility of various mods that interact with common game systems, enhanced Blueprints modification support, technical improvements and optimization</li>



<li>Discord Holiday event</li>



<li>Also, more STALKER: Legends of the Zone Enhanced Edition improvements and the release of STALKER 2: Heart of Chornobyl on PlayStation 5 and PlayStation 5 Pro</li>
</ul>



<p>We don't yet know the release date for the <a href="https://wccftech.com/stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyl-ps5-release-late-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PS5 version of STALKER 2</a>, but we might get the news at Gamescom 2025, where the build will be playable.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, there is still no mention of the multiplayer mode or the DLCs, so it's fair to imagine they won't be arriving this year. Indeed, GSC Game World warned fans that even the items on the aforementioned list may be delayed in case of 'Zone instability', which is a funny way to hint at the potential need for further polishing.</p>



<p>If you're still on the fence about STALKER 2: Heart of Chornobyl, you can find my launch review <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyl-the-anomaly-never-changes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/drag-x-drive-is-more-drag-than-drive.1268847/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>When Nintendo announced <em>Drag x Drive</em>, a Joy-Con mouse-controlled wheelchair sports game, for <a href="https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/686603/nintendo-switch-2-review">the Switch 2</a> I was tentatively excited. I have a lot of time for developers trying new things, and sports video games are hardly replete with disability representation. Having been hands-on with the game, however, <em>Drag x Drive </em>has left me baffled and in significant pain.</p><p>As a “driver” — wheeled robots that come in three mostly indistinct flavors: guard, center, and forward — <em>Drag x Drive </em>has you play pickup games of three-on-three wheelchair basketball. You navigate the game by pushing and pulling your Joy-Cons across a surface in a motion vaguely similar to moving a wheelchair. This with a combination of shoulder button inputs and motion controls lets you move, brake, pass, and shoot.</p><p>Those basic controls are initially intuitive. This includes a satisfying controller rumble if you’re moving, and that’s a <em>big </em>if. My <em>Drag x Drive </em>experience revolved around desperately trying to get the Joy-Cons to register consistently across tables, floors, my bed, and my body. Yet, more often than not, I’d be spinning out and losing control while taking umpteen unintended captures — the home button blessedly appears to be disabled while moving the mouse. My driver regularly took both hands off its wheels unbidden in a comical, yet appropriate, shrug.</p><div><p><cite>Image: The Verge, Nintendo</cite></p></div><p>The game’s 20-minute tutorial tells you to move and then lift the Joy-Cons and to do so in long motions on a flat surface or on your legs. Yet, these actions on their suggested surfaces only contribute to an unresponsiveness that makes controlling <em>Drag x Drive </em>laborious. Any imperfection, be it an uneven table or folds in your clothing, has a significant impact on whether your movements translate appropriately onscreen.</p><p>I found some consistency by sitting cross-legged on my bed, hunched over, using small movements on my bedsheets (and weeping for my 34-year-old back). My legs, too, though error-strewn, were more responsive and quieter than any table I tried. This was especially true — before anyone questions my dedication in finding <em>some way </em>to enjoy this game — when I shaved my upper-legs and used the Joy-Cons on my bare thighs. I can’t tell whether the mouse sensors are too sensitive or not sensitive enough, but it does appear that a soft, malleable, and smooth surface yields the best, if still often frustrating, results.</p><p>If you can get moving, matches are slow and repetitive. Playing bots, loading into the three-minute games took about two minutes, and that wait can be longer online in the hub “Parks,” where you are often forced to wait for other games to finish. The loop of matches is mostly one player wheeling the ball up the court, shooting, and then the opposing team doing the same. Tackling can only be achieved head-on and, with controls that are inconsistent in their responsiveness, intentionally stealing the ball is a major achievement. Similarly, consistent shooting requires being lined up with the basket which is hard at speed, so dunking by riding up the court’s curved edges — something you’ll be doing a lot accidentally anyway — is the best tactic. Some of this sluggishness could be allayed if the games remained chaotic, but after each basket it is impossible to interact with the ball for a few seconds, meaning a delay before play can start again.</p><p>But <em>Drag x Drive </em>isn’t just an onscreen experience, it’s a physical one. This was always going to be an issue for disabled players, but I remain surprised how uncomfortable <em>Drag x Drive </em>is to play — turtling over my bedsheets for grip notwithstanding. I found the narrow claw needed to hold the Joy-Cons in this configuration agonising and lengthy play impossible.</p><p>Controller support is absent. Though, using the Joy-Con as a traditional mouse to navigate menus isn’t so bad (you can also toggle menu movements to the joystick, thankfully). Nor does it appear any additional support, even for the Hori Flex adaptive controller, is planned. Nintendo tells <em>The Verge</em>, “We wanted to focus on the innovative experience of using the Joy-Con 2 mouse and motion controls for this game. However, certain accessibility features can be found and utilized at the hardware system level.”</p><p>What features Nintendo references here, I cannot tell. After <em>Mario Kart World</em>’s reliance on — <a href="https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/686591/nintendo-switch-2-accessibility-features-analysis">an initially impressive</a> — system-level accessibility, it’s a concerning trend that Nintendo directs players to system menus rather than implementing mitigations into games. Though, perhaps it’s something we might have seen coming. Despite the obvious conception of these characters, Nintendo has appeared reluctant to acknowledge the disability inspiration behind the game leading up to the its official release, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/laurakbuzz.bsky.social/post/3lmpb7rrq7c2i">reportedly instructing staff</a> to use the term “vehicles” when attendees said “wheelchairs” at hands-on events <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/mak0.bsky.social/post/3lmpem4h3fc2p">to the confusion</a> <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/thecitywake.bsky.social/post/3lmppixmdhs2t">of many</a>. After several inquiries, Nintendo ultimately tells <em>The Verge</em>, “It has always been the case that the vehicles were inspired by wheelchairs. This was miscommunicated at some events. The gameplay is inspired by a mix of wheelchair basketball, wheelchair rugby, wheelchair motocross, and skateboarding.” It’s notable, however, that the only in-game references to the player characters are the terms “driver” and, on one occasion in the lengthy tutorial, “ballers.”</p><div><p><cite>Image: The Verge, Nintendo</cite></p></div><p>That said, I could not find <em>anything </em>that might help how frustrating and physically uncomfortable <em>Drag x Drive</em>’s control setup rapidly becomes.</p><p>That’s not to say there are no accessibility considerations in the game. <em>Drag x Drive </em>is visually easy to parse, with opposition players highlighted prominently and indicators for what’s happening offscreen being bright and bold. Nor is it entirely joyless. The controls for shooting, a satisfying and responsive flick of the wrist, are a blast when a shot lands. Though, the crispness of the game’s motion controls <em>do </em>further highlight the mouse controls’ deficiencies. Similarly, Rebound Scramble, one of two minigames that breaks up match play, is fleetingly fun as a madcap dash to catch a bouncing ball, though this too soon gets old. The other minigame, an obstacle course, was nothing but infuriating for me.</p><p>I could see <em>Drag x Drive </em>being a somewhat diverting <em>Rocket League </em>clone if it wasn’t stubbornly attached to Nintendo’s gimmicky, throwback to the Wii attitude to controls or simply a frustrating part of a broader suite of sports a la boxing in <em>Wii Sports</em>. But with sluggish, repetitive matches, two minigames, and a few activities in parks to win mostly useless rewards, it’s hard not to notice just how little <em>Drag x Drive </em>has to offer.</p><p>If I can say one good thing about <em>Drag x Drive</em>: it <em>does </em>demonstrate that a game based on wheelchair sports could be great in the right hands. But if you’re hoping for a fast-paced, representative, or even fun foray into wheelchair basketball, this isn’t it.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTgxMTk="><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Geoffrey Bunting</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games-review/758328/drag-x-drive-review]]></content:encoded>

              <p>The launch of the Nintendo Switch 2 saw the GameCube added to the Nintendo Switch Online library of classic games, and although it contained some bangers, there were only three of them. <em>Zelda: The Wind Waker</em> and <em>F-Zero GX</em> are certainly very welcome, but it would have been nice to see it much more packed out. Well, following the meh addition of&nbsp;<em>Super Mario Strikers</em>, more are to come, and next to be added to their number later this month is a somewhat less well known title: <em>Chibi-Robo!</em></p> <p>Starring a cute four-inch-tall robot,&nbsp;<em>Chibi-Robo</em><em>!</em> is an action-puzzle game created by a former developer called Skip, Ltd. Best known for the Game Boy Advance’s super-simple “bit Generation” series, the studio also made a bunch of&nbsp;<em>Chibi</em>-based games published by Nintendo, starting with this Game Cube game, the following it up with <em>Chibi-Robo! Park Patrol</em> for the DS and&nbsp;<em>Chibi-Robo! Zip Lash</em> for the 3DS. The games were certainly not obscure at the time, and&nbsp;<a href="https://kotaku.com/the-nintendo-gamecube-is-now-twenty-years-old-1847670755"><em>Kotaku</em> previously included&nbsp;<em>Chibi-Robo!</em> in its list of classics when the Game Cube turned 20</a>. In 2013,&nbsp;<a href="https://kotaku.com/out-of-nowhere-nintendo-announces-new-chibi-robo-game-653832768"><em>Kotaku</em> called it “one of the most underrated games on Nintendo’s GameCube.”</a> But it’s fair to say it’s a franchise that has perhaps slipped out of the broader consciousness. That’s maybe going to change on August 21 when the game arrives on Switch Online for Switch 2.</p> <p>2005’s&nbsp;<em>Chibi-Robo! Plug Into Adventure</em> (to give it it’s seemingly abandoned full name) is all about completing tasks for the Sanderson family that owns Chibi, but ensuring that your little bot’s batteries never run out. Complete a chore, or help out in a specific situation (whether with the family or the living toys in the household) and you get Happy Points! Who doesn’t want Happy Points? You explore the whole house, looking for mess to clear up, people and toys to help, and generally try to make yourself the most useful little robot in the world. And yeah, I’m in.</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Say hello to Chibi-Robo!</p> <p>Join him on his quest to restore order to the Sanderson house and save the world in Chibi-Robo!, coming to Nintendo GameCube – Nintendo Classics on <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/NintendoSwitch2?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#NintendoSwitch2</a> for <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/NintendoSwitchOnline?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#NintendoSwitchOnline</a> + Expansion Pack members on Aug 21! <a href="https://t.co/BWjL2CbHdL">pic.twitter.com/BWjL2CbHdL</a></p> <p>— Nintendo of America (@NintendoAmerica) <a href="https://twitter.com/NintendoAmerica/status/1955434299185926504?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 13, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>The game’s reviews at the time ran the full gamut. The infamously tough markers at <em>EDGE</em> gave it an incredibly respectable 8, while&nbsp;<em>A.V. Club</em> gave it a kicking. However, most people came down positive but not blown away, resulting in a <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/chibi-robo/critic-reviews/?platform=gamecube">Metacritic average of 75</a>. (It’s <a href="https://kotaku.com/chibi-robo-zip-lash-the-kotaku-review-1736997537">2015 sequel didn’t fair so well</a>.) It’ll be interesting to see how that garish GameCube 3D feels to play today.</p> <p>Skip’s last game was released in 2015, but despite a previously close relationship with Nintendo, the company went quiet for many years, likely closing entirely in 2019 or 2020 but never officially announcing its ignominious end. Which is kinda sad. A few former developers left to form Tiny Wonder Studio, which last year had <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/tinywonderstudio/korobo/">a successful Kickstarter to make a&nbsp;<em>very</em> familiar-looking game called&nbsp;<em>koROBO</em></a>. It’ll be interesting to see if Nintendo is hoping to revive interest in the franchise, given there’s clearly a team interesting in making it.</p> <p>So August 21 for&nbsp;<em>Chibi-Robo!</em>, but we still don’t have dates for the other games <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Games/Nintendo-Switch-2-games/Nintendo-GameCube-Nintendo-Classics-2838110.html">listed</a> as “upcoming” by Nintendo. That list is:</p> <ul> <li><em>Super Mario Sunshine</em></li> <li><em>Fire Emblem: Path of Radiance</em></li> <li><em>Pokémon XD: Gale of Darkness</em></li> <li><em>Luigi’s Mansion</em></li> <li><em>Pokémon Colosseum</em></li> </ul> <p>Come on Nintendo! Hurry up and add them! It’s not like they haven’t all been eminently playable on emulation for literally decades. We wanna play them again!</p> <p>They join the current collection of:</p> <ul> <li><em>The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker</em></li> <li><em>F-ZERO GX</em></li> <li><em>Soul Calibur II</em></li> <li><em>Mario Smash Football</em></li> </ul>

<p>Black Ops 7 news and leaks are starting to come thick and thin. A Tac-Sprint rumor suggests that the developer is toying with the idea of removing Tac-Sprint altogether from Call of Duty: Black Ops 7, it’s claimed.</p>



<p>Tac-Sprint is an auto-run mechanic allowing you to move faster in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-rely-on-17-year-old-reznov-pre-orders/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CoD</a>. It comes with a strict penalty, though: A slightly slower time to aim. Many skilled players have been able to master the nuances of the movement. But there are also plenty of people who wish it weren’t in the game. If you’re one of those people, you might get your wish.</p>



<h2 id="h-black-ops-7-reportedly-trying-out-no-tac-sprint">Black Ops 7 Reportedly Trying Out No Tac-Sprint</h2>



<figure><figcaption>It could be very divisive. Credit to Activision</figcaption></figure>



<p>The leak/report comes from one <a href="https://x.com/TheGhostOfHope" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">TheGhostofHope</a>—one of Call of Duty’s most renowned insiders—who claims to have new information on Tac-Sprint.</p>



<p>“There’s currently a build of Black Ops 7 being tested right now that has no tac sprint. This doesn’t mean the final game won’t have it but this is a very GOOD sign,” they said on X.</p>



<p>Now, they have previously reported that Tac-Sprint <em>is</em> in the game. This has probably been the case in the past, but new developments can always arise. It’s quite likely that a lack of Tac-Sprint in some capacity is being tested for Black Ops 7.</p>

<p>Whether the feature makes it into the full game remains to be seen. We’ll keep you updated on the latest rumors and leaks. Are you hoping Tac-Sprint sits BLOPS 7 out?
