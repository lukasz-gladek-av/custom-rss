            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/three-pokemon-tcg-collections-coming-in-2025-complete-with-unique-items<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>New <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/games/pokemon-trading-card-game" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Pokemon TCG</a> collections are coming next year. Fans of The Pokemon Company's enduring card game should watch for these collections. They will contain unique cards and special physical products for hardcore Pokemon fans.</p>

<h2>The Pokemon TCG Collections Announcement</h2>

<p>According to a post <a href="https://www.pokebeach.com/2024/12/three-tcg-collections-releasing-in-2025-with-new-unique-items-including-lenticular-card" rel="nofollow">on Pokebeach</a>, three new <em>Pokemon TCG</em> collections will be available in North America in 2025.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pokemon-tcg-collections-postcard-image.jpg?itok=Dm707iHS 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pokemon-tcg-collections-postcard-image.jpg?itok=Kp3t_xPA 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The first of these is an "ex-Collection Box" that will be released alongside the <em>Journey Together</em> set on March 28. This set is notable since it will bring back Owners' Pokemon cards. The Collection Box will contain three promo cards, one jumbo card, four booster packs, a code card, and a Polaroid-style postcard.</p>

<p>The last time a Polaroid was included in one of these boxes was part of the 2001 <em>Southern Islands</em> set.</p>

<p>The second of these Pokemon TCG collections is a new Premium Collection box coming April 11. The box will contain six boosters, two promo cards, a photo sticker, a backdrop card, and an acrylic standee sheet.</p>

<p>The post mentions how these products will work isn't entirely clear. However, acrylic stands have been released at Japan's Pokemon Centers before featuring different characters. There's a chance they may operate similarly, letting fans have little dioramas of beloved characters on display.</p>

This will contain five boosters, a code card, three promo cards, and a jumbo lenticular card. This is major since the last time a lenticular card was released, it was in promotion of the 2004 <em>Pokemon Destiny Deoxys</em> movie.</p>

<p>This is different from the lenticular posters contained in certain <em>Pokemon TCG</em> marketing kits. While nice bits of promotion, these promo items aren't real cards.</p>

<p>The <em>Pokemon TCG</em> is one of the most popular trading card games in the world. Its popularity has only grown thanks to the massive success of the mobile game, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-tcg-pocket-dena-revenue" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Pokemon TCG Pocket</em></a><em>.</em></p>

Along the way, they run into Kwai Jun-Fan (Allen Deng). While trying to escape capture on top of a moving train, Jun-Fan is moments away from being thrown off the train until Uatu intervenes by knocking the bad guys to the ground after insinuating that a tragic end for the young boy happens in other timelines. This is typical superhero altruism until you realize the one rule that makes a being a Watcher.</p><p>As a Watcher, Uatu swore an oath to only observe the stories of the multiverse but never interfere. Unfortunately for Uatu, he cares a little too much. The first season finale was entitled “What if...The Watcher broke his oath?” and it saw him assemble a team of superheroes known as the Guardians of the Multiverse in order to take out Ultron. The reason Uatu decided to interfere is because Ultron had gained a multiversal-level consciousness in the previous episode, smashing through the barrier that separates Uatu from the multiverse and proceeding to whoop his ass. </p><p>In this season alone he broke his oath saving Jun-Fan, and in the preceding episode he willed <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/marvel-daredevil-born-again-thunderbolts-ironheart-mcu-1851637009&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-daredevil-born-again-thunderbolts-ironheart-mcu-1851637009">Riri Williams</a></span> (Dominique Thorne) to not succumb to the tragic fate he’s watched her fall victim to over and over again when battling Mysterio (Alejandro Saab). While he didn’t materially interfere, even speaking encouraging words was enough for the three other Watchers to get fed up with Uatu’s frequent infractions. In the latest episode, they stop playing games, and The Eminence pins Uatu against his dimensional barrier after sternly informing him, “We can longer let your interferences go unanswered.” </p><p>It’s always fun when we get to see the full extent of the powers of multiversal deities. Unfortunately, with only a few episodes left in the entire <em>What If...? </em>series, we can only hope we get two episodes full of multiversal mayhem. </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/microsoft-could-be-bringing-haptic-motors-to-xbox-controllers/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Microsoft could be brining updated technology to future Xbox controllers in the form of haptic motors. First found by <a href="https://tech4gamers.com/microsoft-patents-movable-haptic-controller/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Tech4Gamers</a>, a recently <a href="https://patentscope.wipo.int/search/en/detail.jsf?docId=US444401677&amp;_cid=P22-M4Z00G-73974-1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">filed patent</a> suggests Xbox controllers will get new haptic feedback features sometime soon.</p>



<p>According to the patent’s abstract, the new motor features a housing, connector, and haptic motor. Upon activation, the haptic motor will “move relative to the housing to generate the haptic feedback”.</p>



<p>In the patent description, it’s claimed that the haptic motor can be “dynamically” tuned for device optimization. What’s more is that it’s said that the motor can create two types of vibration in order to increase the depth and feel of the feedback. Based on the full contents of the document, it’s suggested that players would get a more personalized experience with the new motors.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>“The concepts described herein enhance a haptic response of a device by incorporating haptic subcomponents into a moving or flexible mechanical architecture of the device that allows for the haptic motor to move relative to a housing of the device,” the patent reads. “This allows for a lower cost, weight, size, and energy consuming haptic component to perform similar to a larger haptic component, or to enhance the haptic response of the larger haptic component.”</p>



<p>With these new moveable and adjustable haptic motors, it seems to be Microsoft’s answer to the popular DualSense controller introduced this console generation from Sony. Microsoft has been developing its new Sebile controller for a while now, and this could be the start of finding out some of its features.</p>



<p>According to <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/xboxs-new-sebile-controller-breaks-cover-in-this-new-patent-and-we-now-know-what-that-the-weird-grippy-trousers-are-for" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Jez Corden of Windows Central</a>, this new controller isn’t likely to launch before the next generation of Xbox hardware.</p>



<p>What do you think of Microsoft adding a new haptic motor to Xbox controllers? Let us know down below, and join the discussion in the official <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums</a>. </p>

<p>Following the positively stellar month of February, a relatively quiet month in March, and now looking forward to the upcoming summer, one would expect April to be relatively tame. Well, that’s correct. The biggest video game releases in April 2025 don’t overly impress, with a few remasters and plenty of niche titles, but don’t expect much in the way of AAA.</p>



<h2 id="h-the-hottest-game-releases-of-april-2025">The Hottest Game Releases of April 2025</h2>



<p>It appears April is the month of visual novels and niche role-playing games, with a heavy dose of action-adventure tossed in for good measure from the indie and AA scene. For those of you who have spent time awaiting The Last of Us Part II on PC, that’s the big release for the month, and it’s not even a new one!</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>The Last of Us Part II Remastered</strong> (PC) – April 3, 2025</li>



<li><strong>Koira </strong>(PC/PlayStation 5) – April 17, 2025</li>



<li><strong>Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves</strong> (PC/PlayStation 4/PlayStation 5/Xbox Series X|S) – April 24, 2025</li>



<li><strong>The Hundred Line: Last Defense Academy</strong> (PC/Nintendo Switch) – April 24, 2025</li>



<li><strong>Tempest Rising</strong> (PC) – April 24, 2025</li>
</ul>



<p>Along with this small handful of titles, Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time launches on Nintendo Switch sometime in April 2025, though we don’t have an official release date yet.</p>







<h2 id="h-looking-forward-to-may-2025">Looking Forward to May 2025</h2>



<p>As of publishing this piece, May is a relatively quiet month with only a handful of titles, most of which are TBA currently, but we suspect more will come as we delve into the year further.</p>



<ul>
<li>Sonic Wings Reunion</li>



<li>Revenge of the Savage Plenty</li>
</ul>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/best-pc-game-of-2024-best-new-pc-games-this-year/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>PC gaming in 2024 was nothing short of extraordinary. This year, developers pushed boundaries, delivering games that dazzled with immersive visuals, innovative mechanics, and stories that kept players glued to their screens. From blockbuster titles redefining beloved genres to indie gems that captured hearts with their creativity, the lineup was packed with unforgettable experiences.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As we look back on the year, these are the standout PC games that left their mark and reminded us why gaming on PC is truly unmatched. Let’s dive into the best PC games of 2024 – the ones that raised the bar and set new standards for the industry.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Before we get into it, it’s worth mentioning that these are games that are either exclusive to PC or released first on the platform.</p>



<h2 id="h-best-pc-game-of-2024-winner-hades-2">Best PC Game Of 2024 Winner — Hades 2</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>The game may have released in “early access” in May, but Hades 2 feels like anything but an early access title. The game takes so much of what made the first game great, and adds to it in ways that make it nearly perfect.</p>



<p>Set after the events of the original game, Hades 2 <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1145350/Hades_II/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">puts players in the role of Melinoë</a>, the Princess of the Underworld and sister of Zagreus, the first game’s protagonist. Guided by her mentor, Hecate, Melinoë’s mission is to stop Chronos, the Titan of Time, who has risen to challenge the gods and mortals who once opposed him.</p>



<p>While the game has a lot of similarities to the orginal, the addition mechanics and features put it over the top. Hades 2 adds a new  Magick Bar that players use for various moves that you recharge as you play. There’s even a new sprint ability that opens up a new world of movement and agility while you play. Hades 2 also introduces multiple pathes to the surface: from&nbsp;Erebus&nbsp;to Tartarus or&nbsp;Ephyra&nbsp;to&nbsp;Mount Olympus.</p>



<p>What makes the game even better, is that it can be completed in under 20 hours if that’s your cup of tea. However, if you are a completionist who needs to do everything in a game, then Hades 2 can teak you nearly 60 hours to do everything. It’s really up to how you want to play.</p>



<h2>Best PC Games of 2024 Nominations</h2>



<p>While Hades 2 stood out as the best PC game of 2024, that doesn’t mean there weren’t other great options for players. From action to city-building, there was something for every type of game this year. Here are some of the other top PC games to release over the last 12 months.</p>



<h3>I Am Your Beast</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>Released in September, I Am Your Beast is another excellent game from Strange Scaffold. You play as former government agent Alphonse Harding who is asked to do “one last job”. After turning it down, you find yourself against the same group that tried to recruit you in the first place.</p>



<p>The game features fast-paced action that has made it popular for speed running. It also has some of the most violent yet enticing gameplay you’ll find from any game, let alone an indie title. I Am Your Beast features 25 levels that make you feel like you are playing a modern version of classic Doom and Duke Nukem 3D just in shorter bursts. Those short bursts — the levels take only a couple minutes to get through — helps with that feeling of wanting to keep coming back for more.  It’s <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1876590/I_Am_Your_Beast/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a great hook</a> that gives you that “just one more level” feeling every time. It’s a game that becomes hard to put down once you get started.</p>



<h3>UFO 50</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>Dozens of games within a single game make for a great game. Yeah, you read that right. UFO 50 features 50 different games from various genres. The game acts as a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1147860/UFO_50/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">“showcase” of the games</a> developed by UFO Soft for the LX-I, LX-II, and LX-III consoles during the 1980s. While the fictional showcase is a cool concept, it’s the games you can play that make it just so good. </p>



<p>Bushido Ball takes a simple concept like Pong and adds samurai swords, ninjas, and shot abilities. Then there’s the RPG Grimstone that feels like the old Final Fantasy games. My favorite, however, is the Metroidvania Mini &amp; Max. It takes a number of great concepts from the genre, and makes t hem easy and accessible. It’s one of those games that even as a standalone game would be considered a good indie game.</p>



<p>No matter what you’re into, there’s bound to be a game in UFO 50 to feed your appetite. Of course, there’s also the hidden 51st game that’s just as much fun as the first 50.</p>



<h3>Frostpunk 2</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>A highly-anticipated city-builder, Frostpunk 2 <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1601580/Frostpunk_2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">released in September</a> to mass acclaim from most players and critics. The game is set 30 years after the “Great Storm” of the first title, and sees players take on the role of the “Steward” following the death of the original Captain. As you play, you have to handle population issues, resource scarcity, and the transition into a new era. Building upon the first game, Frostpunk 2 also lets you build a bigger city with districts that serve specific purposes.</p>



<p>As you expand and create districts, you also have to manage factions with different ideologies, leading to potential conflict among citizens. Lastly, there’s a council that represents the different factions that you present your laws and regulations to. You function more like an actual government in Frostpunk 2 than any city-builder I’ve played before it, and it sets a stage for what I believe future games in the genre should strive for.</p>



<p>This PC game was so well received that it even won the Best Gameplay award at the Gamescom Awards 2024. It’s so much more than your typical city-builder that Frostpunk 2 is a game that you can easily get lost in for hours at a time. </p>

			<p>A team of modders is working to add multiplayer to Insomniac's Marvel's Spider-Man on PC, and they've got a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nu8e-Q2l_ek" target="_blank" rel="noopener">trailer</a> to prove it already works. The original game, of course, offered no such feature, and neither did the sequel, despite some <a href="https://wccftech.com/marvels-spider-man-2-co-op-mode-teased-by-miles-morales-actor/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">short-lived rumors</a> and the fact that you do actually collaborate with the other Spider-Man (both Peter Parker and Miles Morales are playable <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/marvels-spider-man-2-ultimate-incarnation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in the game</a>, and you can swap between them while in the open world), but only as an NPC.</p>
<p>However, Insomniac did at least toy with the idea several times. Back in 2021, the studio was <a href="https://wccftech.com/insomniac-games-new-multiplayer-game-pve-melee-combat/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recruiting</a> for a multiplayer game with PvE (player versus environment) melee combat. That turned out to be <a href="https://wccftech.com/spider-man-the-great-web-trailer-leak-spider-gwen/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Spider-Man: The Great Web</a>, a cooperative multiplayer game that leaked as part of <a href="https://wccftech.com/insomniac-games-hacked-by-a-ransomware-attack-data-surrounding-marvels-wolverine-surfaces-online/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Insomniac's hack</a>. The game would have allowed five players to take the roles of various members of the Spider family, including Spider-Gwen.</p>
<p>Let's go back to Marvel's Spider-Man, though. Modders <a href="https://wccftech.com/spider-man-remastered-code-includes-co-op-multiplayer-mode-references/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">identified</a> multiplayer references in the game's code as early as two years ago. There might have been some hooks they're now using in the project. The team has shared the following FAQ on its Discord:</p>
<p><em>When is this mod coming out?</em><br>
<em>No release date as of yet.</em></p>
<p><em>Is there PVP?</em><br>
<em>No, it currently isn't a feature to fight other players in Multiplayer but it may get looked at in the future.</em></p>
<p><em>What is the Player Limit?</em><br>
<em>The Player Limit in Spider-Man Multiplayer is 16 players.</em></p>
<p><em>Is this a mod for MSM1 or MSM2?</em><br>
<em>This is a mod for MSM1, however we will look into porting to MSM2 once it releases.</em></p>
<p><em>Does the main story work?</em><br>
<em>Some main story missions do work but we're working on free roam content currently and will look into main story more at a later date.</em></p>
<p><em>Do mods work?</em><br>
<em>Yes.</em></p>
<p><em>Can my friends see my mods?</em><br>
<em>Friends can see your suit mods so long as you both have the same suit mods installed. If you don't then the person who doesn't have the suit mod installed will not be able to see the person with the suit. Additionally if you use animation mods it's better for all players to have it installed.</em></p>
<p><em>How long has this mod been under development?</em><br>
<em>This mod has been in development since August 2024.</em></p>
<p><em>How does connecting to players work?</em><br>
<em>You create a lobby, and then other players can either join via a Steam invite or you can add the host's IP and join that way.</em></p>
<p><em>What platforms are supported?</em><br>
<em>Steam and Epic Games Store versions are the supported Marvel's Spider-Man copies in which multiplayer will work.</em></p>
<p><iframe title="Spider-Man Multiplayer Trailer (Mod)" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Nu8e-Q2l_ek?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Now, there's many ways this could go wrong. Mod teams blow up all the time, either due to insurmountable technical hurdles, internal drama, or just plain old real life commitments (they're not professionals, after all). Sony could also kick the Marvel's Spider-Man multiplayer mod to the curb to prevent it from being released. Nintendo <a href="https://wccftech.com/zelda-breath-of-the-wild-multiplayer-mod-creators-attacked-by-nintendo-through-copyright-strikes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">did it</a> for the Breath of the Wild mod, effectively killing it.</p>
<p>Still, there are plenty of instances where this actually worked<span><span>—more or less.&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/skyrim-together-reborn-co-op-mod-is-finally-out/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Skyrim Together</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/sekiro-online-mod-pvp-coop/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sekiro multiplayer</a>, and&nbsp;<a href="http://wccftech.com/just-cause-3-multiplayer-mod/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Just Cause 3 multiplayer</a> are some of the most famous examples of multiplayer mods successfully added to single-player only games</span>.</span> Another interesting project to keep track of is '<a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-multiplayer-mod/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CyberMP</a>,' which plans to introduce multiplayer to Cyberpunk 2077.</p>

			<p>While 2024 didn't see the release of new entries in staple franchises like Devil May Cry or Bayonetta, the past 12 months were still very good for action games fans thanks to the release of a variety of very solid games coming from both veterans of the genre and newcomers that left more than a few players surprised with the high level of competence shown in their debut titles, so high that it is almost difficult to tell that they haven't been developed by studios with more experience in the action games genre.</p>
<p>Here are the five best action games released in 2024 on PC and consoles, alongside a few other games that, while not as good as the best five, definitely deserve to be mentioned for their quality and for what they brought to the genre as a whole.</p>
<p><em>Previously on Wccftech's Best Games of 2024: <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-shooter-games-of-2024-fun-blasts-for-everyone/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Shooters</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-roleplaying-games-of-2024-a-year-for-the-history-books/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RPGs</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-indie-games-of-2024-full-house/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Indies</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-fighting-games-of-2024-the-return-of-the-strongest/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fighting</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-horror-games-of-2024-a-bloody-massacre/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Horror</a></em></p>
<h2>Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown (<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/prince-of-persia-the-lost-crown-who-needs-sands-time/">9</a>)</h2>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Prince-of-Persia-The-Lost-Crown-header.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>The Prince of Persia series has always been at the forefront of the action games genre, but for a very long time, the series has been away from the spotlight. The long-dormant franchise, however, was finally brought back this year with Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown, and what a way to come back it is. Returning to the roots of the series, the game developed by Ubisoft Montpelier is an amazing Metroidvania game featuring an engaging story and extremely solid gameplay mechanics that make it not only one of the best action games released in the past few years but also one of the best Metroidvania games ever released. Here's what I had to say about the game in my review.</p>
<p><em>Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown couldn't have brought back the series after its more than a decade-long hiatus in a better way. With an engaging story, well-crafted Metroidvania mechanics, and a touch of character-action games features in its combat system, Sargon's adventure will be remembered by fans for a long time, even with its minor issues.</em></p>
<h2>Stellar Blade (<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/stellar-blade-review-nearly-automatic-angel/">9</a>)</h2>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Stellar_Blade-HD-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Much like with Black Myth Wukong, the hype surrounding Stellar Blade was definitely bigger than what one may have expected for a debut title of a developer who had released only mobile games up until this point, but in the end, like for Game Science's first game, Korean studio Shift Up proved they had what it takes to make a compelling action game. While the over-sexualized character design may be offputting for some players, there's no denying that the Korean developers knew what they were doing, enriching the obvious inspiration from Yoko Taro's NieR series with some light RPG and Soulslike mechanics that make the game a joy to both look at and play. Here's what Kai Tatsumoto had to say about the game in his review.</p>
<p><em>No butts about it, Stellar Blade is a marvelous feast for the eyes and a technically impressive action RPG. Those who find the hyper-sexualized Eve offputting will find little redemption in finding some modesty for the playable heroine, but at the same time, those already accustomed to the years following Bayonetta’s release and 2Booty memes will find the character designs enjoyable, to say the least. Stellar Blade is a fantastic action title and one PlayStation exclusive you’ll have to play after the kids go to bed.</em></p>
<h2>Senua's Saga: Hellblade II (<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/senuas-saga-hellblade-ii-the-perfect-game-pass-experience/">8</a>)</h2>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/Hellblade-II.jpeg"></a></figure>

<p>Ninja Theory released quite a few games over the course of the years, but none managed to become commercial successes, except for Hellblade: Senua's Saga, a narrative-focused game that offered solid action combat in the vein of the previous titles developed by the studio. With Senua's Saga: Hellblade II, Ninja Theory doubled down on everything that made the original game so unique, keeping the oppressive atmosphere and combat system and turning it up to eleven with one of the most impressive visual showcases of the generation powered by Unreal Engine 5. A remarkable game that is definitely not for everyone, but one that is worth experiencing for those looking for an extremely immersive experience. Here's what Alessio Palumbo had to say about the game in his review:</p>
<p><em>Senua's Saga: Hellblade II keeps virtually the same scope and structure of the independent triple-A game made in 2017 by Ninja Theory. The story is just as poignant, the visuals are stunning, and the experience is one that every Game Pass user should check out for themselves. However, those hoping for a more traditional game in the vein of the God of War reboot will inevitably be disappointed, and this is unlikely to have nearly that level of success, which is what Microsoft still desperately needs.</em></p>
<h2>Black Myth Wukong (<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/black-myth-wukong-a-compelling-journey-into-chinese-tradition/">8.5</a>)</h2>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/black-myth-wukong-HD-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Right from its out-of-the-blue announcement in late 2020, it was clear how Black Myth Wukong was going to be an extremely popular game, as the trailer showcasing the pre-alpha build reached 2 million views on YouTube and over 10 million views on Chinese video-sharing website Bilibili in just 24 hours. Being the very first PC and console game by an unproven developer, however, there was the chance that all the hype could have been for nothing, but Game Science proved detractors wrong by releasing a solid action game inspired by FromSoftware's Souls series. While being based on the popular Journey to the West novel may have contributed to the game's huge popularity, especially in China, Black Myth Wukong is definitely a game that fans of the genre should experience, even if it doesn't exactly attempt to break the mold to offer anything innovative. Here's what I had to say in my review:</p>
<p><em>Black Myth: Wukong stands out as one of the strongest debut games released in recent times. While not groundbreaking in any way, it masterfully blends elements from several popular franchises to deliver an engaging action RPG experience that ranks just below the very best in the genre. Although stuttering issues and minor gameplay flaws hold it back slightly, these shouldn't deter any action RPG or action game fan from picking it up. The Journey to the West has rarely been this enjoyable.</em></p>
<h2>Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster (<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/dead-rising-deluxe-remaster-coming-back-to-life/">8</a>)</h2>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Dead-Rising-Deluxe-Remaster.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Dead Rising is among the many CAPCOM series that were put to the side following the disappointing performance on the market of their latest entry, but the Japanese publisher has been showing over the past few months that it is finally willing to bring some of these franchises back to their former glory. In this regard, Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster couldn't have brought back Frank West's iconic first adventure in a better way, as exploring Willamette Parkview Mall and killing zombies with all sorts of makeshift weapons has never been so much fun.</p>
<p>While the basic experience feels a little dated, and the visual remaster leaves something to be desired in some ways, the quality-of-life improvements make this remaster-meets-remake a game that is worthy of experiencing both for veterans of the franchise and newcomers. Here's what I had to say about the game in my review.</p>
<p><em>Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster is a solid remaster that enhances the original game with some welcome gameplay and quality-of-life improvements that go a long way to make the experience more enjoyable than ever. However, the remaster falters in the visual department, with dull colors that pale in comparison to the vibrant visuals of the original. Still, there's plenty to like in the Deluxe Remaster, as Frank West's journey to Willamette remains as engaging as ever, though the mostly faithful recreation of the original gameplay feels a little dated compared to its sequels.</em></p>

The 2001 Dreamcast game introduced a new brooding antihero in Shadow the Hedgehog, and expanded the <em>Sonic </em>mythos into some dark territory. <em>Sonic 3 </em>isn’t a one-to-one retelling of <em>Sonic Adventure 2</em>, however. After two movies and a TV show, the live-action series has its own established lore, so the third film makes some pretty big changes to the original storyline while still keeping the darker tone and themes of <em>Sonic Adventure 2 </em>intact. Well, when it’s not doing the corny dance breaks and cheesy one-liners, at least. If you’ve never played <em>Sonic Adventure 2</em>, you might be curious just what was changed for the big screen, so here are a few of the major differences between <em>Sonic 3 </em>and <em>Sonic Adventure 2</em>. Spoilers ahead!</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="65098a80c28f4c4fda0e89cde63daa0c" data-recommend-id="image://65098a80c28f4c4fda0e89cde63daa0c" data-format="jpg" data-width="2000" data-height="1125" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Rouge flies through the White Space holding a Chaos Emerald." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Rouge flies through the White Space holding a Chaos Emerald." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Sega</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="65098a80c28f4c4fda0e89cde63daa0c" data-recommend-id="image://65098a80c28f4c4fda0e89cde63daa0c" data-format="jpg" data-width="2000" data-height="1125" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Rouge flies through the White Space holding a Chaos Emerald." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>The most glaring difference between <em>Sonic the Hedgehog 3 </em>and <em>Sonic Adventure 2 </em>is the absence of Rouge the Bat. The Dreamcast game had two dueling stories: Hero and Dark. The Hero story followed Sonic, Tails, and Knuckles as they attempted to thwart Eggman’s latest plan to rule the world, while the Dark side followed Eggman’s story alongside those of two new companions: the Ultimate Lifeform Shadow the Hedgehog, and a double agent government spy named Rouge the Bat. Rouge has yet to appear in the live-action universe, but she acts as Knuckles’ rival and Shadow’s teammate in the video game continuity. Elements of her story in <em>Sonic Adventure 2 </em>still exist in <em>Sonic 3</em>, with the heist segment in the second act an obvious stand-in for her level Security Hall, but there’s no sign of the treasure hunter in the movie itself.</p><p>There have been reports that Paramount plans to give Shadow his own spin-off, and since Rouge didn’t show up in the movie based on her debut game, this would be the most logical place for her to appear next.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="5efc87715f6ced88da8582e0b2fe71a5" data-recommend-id="image://5efc87715f6ced88da8582e0b2fe71a5" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Black Doom looms over Shadow as he clutches his head in pain." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Black Doom looms over Shadow as he clutches his head in pain." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Sega</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="5efc87715f6ced88da8582e0b2fe71a5" data-recommend-id="image://5efc87715f6ced88da8582e0b2fe71a5" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Black Doom looms over Shadow as he clutches his head in pain." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>The <em>Sonic </em>movies have established that the speedy anthropomorphic animals saving the world are aliens from other planets. It was eventually revealed in <em>Shadow the Hedgehog</em> that Shadow has some alien DNA in him in the games, but he was initially presented as a creation made by humans when he debuted in <em>Sonic Adventure 2. Sonic 3</em> fully commits to the alien backstory, revealing that he was found 50 years before the events of the film when a mysterious meteor landed on Earth. The GUN forces who investigated found Shadow inside and began running experiments on him in a hidden facility on Earth, rather than the Space Colony Ark orbiting the planet seen in the games.</p><p>Shadow’s backstory in the games is a bit more complicated, to the point where I’m not surprised they simplified it for the film’s shorter run time. In <em>Sonic Adventure 2</em>, Shadow is revealed as an invention by Gerald Robotnik, Eggman’s grandfather. The hedgehog was meant to be the Ultimate Lifeform, capable of unlocking the key to immortality. In <em>Shadow the Hedgehog</em>, it’s revealed that, in desperation, Gerald made a deal with an alien despot called Black Doom, who used his own DNA to help the professor finalize Shadow’s creation. In return for Black Doom’s help, Shadow would assist the Black Arms alien invaders take over the world. Shadow doesn’t know where he came from in <em>Sonic 3</em>, so it’s still possible that the Black Arms will play a role in a future film as his origins are revealed, but Gerald Robotnik didn’t create him in this continuity; he merely led the project that researched him after he fell to Earth. </p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="9540781f611ef30f8f01c93bfddc0a44" data-recommend-id="image://9540781f611ef30f8f01c93bfddc0a44" data-format="jpg" data-width="1366" data-height="768" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Shadow holds a collapsed Maria." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Shadow holds a collapsed Maria." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Sega</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="9540781f611ef30f8f01c93bfddc0a44" data-recommend-id="image://9540781f611ef30f8f01c93bfddc0a44" data-format="jpg" data-width="1366" data-height="768" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Shadow holds a collapsed Maria." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>In the games, Gerald was deeply invested in finding the key to immortality because his granddaughter, Maria Robotnik, had a terminal illness called Neuro-Immune Deficiency Syndrome. This led to the creation of Shadow and his prototype called the Biolizard, immortal creatures made with the hope that they could help facilitate similar breakthroughs for humanity. However, Maria seems to be a perfectly healthy kid in <em>Sonic 3</em>. I suppose, since Gerald isn’t creating Shadow in this timeline, there was no need to include her sickness as a motivator for his research. The sibling-like relationship between Maria and Shadow still hits many of the same notes, however. In both continuities, the two become inseparable friends that bond even as Shadow is being subject to experiments every day. Eventually, Maria’s death at the hands of GUN agents leads Shadow to try to destroy the world in both the games and the movies, but she lived her life as a healthy young girl in the films.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="b326d2909261b2ecf17955b7cafd0fe5" data-recommend-id="image://b326d2909261b2ecf17955b7cafd0fe5" data-format="jpg" data-width="2000" data-height="1125" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Maria prepares to send Shadow to Earth." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Maria prepares to send Shadow to Earth." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Sega</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="b326d2909261b2ecf17955b7cafd0fe5" data-recommend-id="image://b326d2909261b2ecf17955b7cafd0fe5" data-format="jpg" data-width="2000" data-height="1125" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Maria prepares to send Shadow to Earth." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Though Maria <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/sonic-the-hedgehog-3-movie-shadow-maria-death-actor-1851227374&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/sonic-the-hedgehog-3-movie-shadow-maria-death-actor-1851227374">does reach a tragic end</a></span> in <em>Sonic 3</em>, her death is slightly different than it is in the source material. In most versions of the story, whether that be the games, anime, or comics, Maria is shot by GUN agents. In the live-action universe, Maria is nearly shot as she and Shadow attempt to make their escape after GUN shuts down the project and puts Shadow into stasis. However, the GUN agent that had her in his sights is interrupted by Commander Walters, who gets into a scrap with the shooter, leading to a shot being fired into a tank containing deposits of Shadow’s Chaos energy, setting off an explosion that results in Maria’s death. I imagine Paramount didn’t want to put a scene of a child being shot by the military in its widely distributed feature film, though elements of the original scene remain, as her death was still caused by GUN shutting down the project and attempting to eliminate loose ends.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="8da3290370560ee21a9f062550dea511" data-recommend-id="image://8da3290370560ee21a9f062550dea511" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Gerald is shown wearing a white lab coat and red shirt." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Gerald is shown wearing a white lab coat and red shirt." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Paramount</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="8da3290370560ee21a9f062550dea511" data-recommend-id="image://8da3290370560ee21a9f062550dea511" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Gerald is shown wearing a white lab coat and red shirt." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Jim Carrey plays two Robotniks in <em>Sonic 3</em>.

The movie version of Gerald is still alive, and able to manipulate Shadow and his grandson into doing his bidding.

Since Amy’s not around and Shadow isn’t brainwashed, his turn from villain to hero comes from a different source: Sonic. After the two enter their super forms and beat each other senseless, Sonic comes to his senses and has a heart-to-heart with his rival about the futile nature of revenge, eventually reminding Shadow that even if Maria is gone, his love for her still lives on, leading to the sick as hell team-up as the hedgehogs save the day.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="9cf0e4a01b85c2802f767f4b400025d0" data-recommend-id="image://9cf0e4a01b85c2802f767f4b400025d0" data-format="jpg" data-width="2068" data-height="1159" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Shadow looks up at a broken Moon." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Shadow looks up at a broken Moon." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Sega</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="9cf0e4a01b85c2802f767f4b400025d0" data-recommend-id="image://9cf0e4a01b85c2802f767f4b400025d0" data-format="jpg" data-width="2068" data-height="1159" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Shadow looks up at a broken Moon." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>In <em>Sonic Adventure 2</em>, Eggman and Shadow use the Eclipse Cannon, a superweapon developed by Gerald Robotnik, to destroy part of the moon. This is meant as a show of power to make the people of Earth surrender to Eggman’s rule. In <em>Sonic 3</em>, however, our heroes divert its aim away from Earth, so instead of a direct hit on the moon, the cannon slices off the southern end. It looks like the world is just gonna let it stay that way, too, as you can see the severed section hanging out in the moon’s orbit in the post-credits scene.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="bc4131dd1d71b69a9f5aa85d2258f5bc" data-recommend-id="image://bc4131dd1d71b69a9f5aa85d2258f5bc" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The Biolizard thrashes in anger." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Biolizard thrashes in anger." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Sega</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="bc4131dd1d71b69a9f5aa85d2258f5bc" data-recommend-id="image://bc4131dd1d71b69a9f5aa85d2258f5bc" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The Biolizard thrashes in anger." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p> In the final few minutes of the film, Sonic and Shadow team up, use the Master Emerald to take on their super forms, and save the world from cataclysmic destruction. This also occurs in <em>Sonic Adventure 2</em>, but while the movies have the two face an army of Gerald’s robots, the speedy hedgehogs fight something else as a final boss in the game. As a last-ditch effort to destroy the world, The Biolizard, the prototype for the Ultimate Lifeform, fuses with the Space Colony Ark and attempts to keep it on a collision course toward the planet. The Biolizard isn’t mentioned in the movie and seemingly doesn’t exist in the film universe, so while the final battle still has most of the elements that matter, our heroes are squarely focused on fighting Gerald in the climax. </p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="f863e598b765167c90669747add4e6aa" data-recommend-id="image://f863e598b765167c90669747add4e6aa" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Eggman touches one of Sonic's quills to his tongue." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Eggman touches one of Sonic's quills to his tongue." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Paramount</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="f863e598b765167c90669747add4e6aa" data-recommend-id="image://f863e598b765167c90669747add4e6aa" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Eggman touches one of Sonic's quills to his tongue." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>After our heroes divert the Eclipse Cannon from Earth, the facility becomes unstable and self-destructs.

Eggman, meanwhile, survives the events of the Dreamcast game and lives to bother Sonic and his friends another day. If Carrey’s version of the series villain is well and truly dead (there’s no tease of his survival like there was at the end of <em>Sonic the Hedgehog 2</em>), then that’ll be one of the biggest deviations <em>Sonic 3 </em>makes from the source material.</p><p>It’s still unclear how the movies will go on without him, but given the sendoff the character got, it would feel cheap to bring him back.

But the smooth always comes with the rough, and the past year really has been a rocky one for the things we love and the people who make them.   </p><p data-cy="paragraph">From layoffs and studio closures to costly consoles, underwhelming adaptations and struggling sequels, these are the biggest disappointments in 2024. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Gaming Industry Layoffs and Closures</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">The games industry found itself facing a crisis in 2023 as many publishers and studios, both large and small, made scores of staff redundant in an effort to cut costs. But the pains of that year would be repeated in 2024, which has seen an <a href="https://publish.obsidian.md/vg-layoffs/Archive/2024" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">estimated 14,600 job losses</a> - a 39% increase year-on-year. The cuts have seen thousands of talented studio staff thrown into the most difficult job market the games industry has ever seen, with developers attempting to find new roles in a landscape where companies are slimming down. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Among the major companies cutting staff loose have been <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/riot-lays-off-more-league-of-legends-developers-while-promising-to-increase-team-size">Riot</a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-lays-off-another-650-staff-from-its-video-game-workforce-xbox-boss-phil-spencer-sends-memo-to-staff">Microsoft</a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/destiny-developer-bungie-cuts-220-staff-some-of-the-most-difficult-changes-weve-ever-had-to-make-as-a-studio">Bungie</a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/unity-software-laying-off-25-percent-of-staff-amid-company-reset">Unity</a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/take-two-announces-layoffs-while-canceling-multiple-in-development-projects">TakeTwo Interactive</a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ea-to-lay-off-around-670-to-advance-the-way-we-work">EA</a>, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-announces-significant-playstation-layoffs-affecting-900-staff-london-studio-to-close">PlayStation</a>. Such businesses have reduced their staff numbers for a variety of reasons and factors, be that rising development costs, shifting player habits in the years following the COVID-19 pandemic, and the global impact of the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Whatever the reasons, remaining staff at these publishers and studios must continue to work in uncertain times without the aid of their former colleagues. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">That is if their studio still exists. Adding to the dismal picture are several studio closures. Perhaps the most prominent among them is Arkane Austin, Bethesda’s immersive sim specialist responsible for the acclaimed Prey. Sadly its most recent release, Redfall, was a critical and commercial bomb – a situation that seemingly sealed its fate. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-closes-redfall-developer-arkane-austin-hifi-rush-developer-tango-gameworks-and-more-in-devastating-cuts-at-bethesda">Arkane Austin was shuttered by parent company Microsoft, along with Alpha Dog Games, Roundhouse Games, and Hi-Fi Rush developer Tango Gameworks</a>. Somewhat miraculously, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hi-fi-rush-ip-and-tango-gameworks-acquired-by-krafton-from-xbox-studio-will-no-longer-be-shut-down">Tango was rescued by Krafton</a> in a last-minute turn of fate, but such good news is rare. Also suffering closure this year was <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/playstation-london-studio-issues-heartfelt-goodbye-after-sony-studio-closure">PlayStation’s London Studio</a>, Galvanic Games, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/just-cause-developer-avalanche-shuttering-two-studios-and-laying-off-50-workers">Avalanche Studio Group’s New York and Montreal studios</a>, as well as others. To say it's been a tough year is an understatement.    </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Trend-chasing Failures</h2><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/11/27/aaabubbleign-1732744598662.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Concord</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Another developer closed for good is <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/firewalk-studios-officially-closing-following-concords-disastrous-release-and-subsequent-shutdown">Firewalk Studios</a>, the team behind what is certainly PlayStation’s biggest disaster of the generation: <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/concord-review">Concord</a>. A PvP hero shooter, its long and costly development meant it arrived long after the genre had peaked in popularity. But, despite being developed by many FPS veterans hailing from the likes of Bungie and Activision, what could have been PlayStation’s next big multiplayer phenomenon <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/concord-is-estimated-to-have-sold-only-25000-units-heres-why-analysts-think-its-failing">struggled to stand out from the likes of Overwatch and Apex Legends</a> thanks to its lacklustre character kits and standard fare objective design. From the outside Concord simply looked like another typical hero shooter, which meant few wanted to see what was going on inside. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s not an exaggeration to say that almost no one turned up for its August release – it achieved <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-live-service-shooter-concord-debuts-to-a-tragic-697-concurrent-players-on-steam">a high of just 697 concurrent players on Steam</a> during its first week. Less than two weeks later, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/playstation-shooter-concord-going-offline-this-week">Sony pulled Concord from sale</a>, refunded players, and shut the game down. By the end of October, Firewalk Studios was closed for business. It all sadly means Concord is gone without a trace. Well, almost – <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/amazons-ill-fated-concord-animation-shows-potential-of-this-world-and-characters-creator-says">an episode of Amazon’s Secret Level</a> animated series serves as <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/every-secret-level-episode-explained#episode-13-concord">a prequel</a> to the ongoing Concord in-game story that never happened.  </p><p data-cy="paragraph">A similar, thankfully less tragic story also happened earlier this year with Rocksteady’s Suicide Squad: Kill The Justice League. After months of poorly-received marketing, Sucide Squad launched as a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-review">critical </a>and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-flop-leads-to-200-million-impairment-charge-warner-bros-confirms">commercial bomb</a>. As with Concord, much of Kill The Justice League’s failings were due to chasing trends that players have long since largely tired of – in this case, the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2024-is-the-year-live-service-shooter-trends-need-to-die">Destiny-style live-service shooter grind</a>. It didn’t help that Suicide Squad resembled Crystal Dynamics’ ill-fated Avengers game from a few years back, which similarly annoyed players for being a repetitive multiplayer PvE game. In Suicide Squad’s case, it was a shattering fall from grace for a studio that previously made beloved single-player Batman games. Many of us just wanted more of that best-in-class superhero action with a villainous twist, but sadly Warner Bros’ chase of live-service revenue seemingly got in the way. Not that it paid off - an initial lack of sales and dwindling players has contributed to a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-spurs-double-digit-drop-in-wb-gaming-revenue">significant revenue decline</a> for the company.  </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Hardware Hiccups</h2><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/10/11/ps5-pro-1728648448665.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">PlayStation 5 Pro</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The time-compressing effect of the pandemic years has disguised the fact that, yes, we’re already at the midpoint of the current console generation. Right on cue, Sony delivered its mid-cycle refresh PlayStation 5 Pro, and it’s safe to say that practically <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/polls-ps5-pro-price-reveal">no one was pleased by its $700 price tag</a>. That’s not just down to the cost of living squeezing everyone’s wallets – <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/videos/ps5-pro-reveal-full-technical-presentation">Mark Cerny’s presentation</a> that apparently showcased the console’s ability to render The Last of Us Part 2 Remastered so much better than the base console was basically the “They’re the same picture” meme from The Office in action. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">While there’s definitely time for the PS5 Pro to prove why it costs $200 more than the regular PS5, the initial results have been pretty disappointing. Rather than eliminate the need to decide between quality and performance modes, developers have added even more options to Pro-patched games, with confusing names such as ‘Fidelity Pro’ and ‘Versatility’. Remember when you just plugged in a console and it worked? Halcyon days. Plus, all the Pro’s extra power can’t even <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bloodborne-ps5-pro-can-you-see-the-difference">make Bloodborne look any better</a>. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">At least Sony fans got a console, though. After months of rumours that Nintendo was due to announce its successor to the Switch, the company announced a brand new piece of hardware: an alarm clock. Yes, the Alarmo is <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/forget-switch-2-nintendo-just-released-a-100-interactive-alarm-clock-called-alarmo">a $100 clock with game-themed alarms</a> and a motion sensor that can detect when you’ve got out of bed. It’s hardly the Switch 2 we were hoping for. And even when it comes to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/alarmo-latest-in-long-line-of-weird-nintendo-hardware-some-failed-hard">Nintendo’s history of weird hardware</a>, Alarmo is far from the most interesting or bizarre. A true disappointment from the house of Mario.   </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Unreliable Reliables</h2><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/06/18/acolyte-ep-4-blogroll-1718749369038.jpeg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Star Wars: The Acolyte</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Over in the realm of television, things have largely been bright thanks to the likes of Arcane, Shogun, and Fallout. But 2024 also saw some traditionally reliable shows struggle to maintain their quality. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-bear-season-3-review">Season 3 of The Bear certainly wasn’t bad</a> – it once again provided some solid character drama and beautifully-shot kitchen nightmares. But, compared to the incredible highs of the first two seasons, this third chapter fell significantly short. Its frustratingly slow pace clashed with the lightning speed of previous years, and the focus being almost entirely on Carmy’s inner crisis forced valuable characters like Sydney into the sidelines.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Similarly, we saw this year’s Star Wars project struggle to hit the highs of The Mandalorian and Andor. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/star-wars-the-acolyte-season-1-review-disney-plus">The Acolyte</a> was built on a fascinating premise that delved into the galaxy’s past, exploring the late High Republic era. It was packed with Jedi and featured one of the coolest lightsaber battles in the entire franchise, but even that couldn’t save the series from its sloppy and often infuriating storytelling. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Acolyte’s saving grace could have been Manny Jacinto’s Sith lord The Stranger, who sports one of the most menacing helmets in all of Star Wars. But while deeper exploration of his character could have resulted in a much-improved season two, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-acolyte-wont-be-renewed-for-a-second-season-on-disney-plus">we’ll never get to see that</a> thanks to Disney axing the show entirely. This isn’t just a Disney problem – Netflix has also continued its habit of cancelling shows after barely giving them a chance to realise their full potential. 2024’s Netflix cull included <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/jeff-goldblum-netflix-series-kaos-cancelled-after-one-season">Kaos</a> and Dead Boy Detectives, which join last year’s Lockwood &amp; Co in the “cancelled after a single season” club. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Awful Adaptations</h2><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/09/30/yakuzadragon-thumb-1727718807880.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Like a Dragon: Yakuza</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">This year’s Fallout was a stellar exercise of how to adapt a video game for television, with Amazon’s wasteland show being among our TV highlights of 2024. But it seems like Fallout’s success isn’t a guaranteed indicator that every Amazon video game show will be fantastic, as proven by the dreadful <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/like-a-dragon-yakuza-review-prime-video">Like a Dragon: Yakuza show</a> that landed on the service several months later. Featuring no karaoke, far too little Majima, and far too much melodrama, Like a Dragon totally failed to capture the stark contrast between serious and silly that the Yakuza games thrive on.  </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It wasn’t just Japanese RPGs that were treated poorly for TV this year, though. Famed Japanese manga Uzumaki also received its long-awaited animated adaptation, and the results <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/uzumaki-full-series-review-adult-swim">couldn’t have gone any worse</a>. The four-part Adult Swim show turned Junji Ito’s monochrome horror into a rushed mess that sprinted to the finale, undermining plot points, character arcs, and scares on the way. The biggest disappointment, though, was the severe drop in animation quality following a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/uzumaki-review-adult-swim">visually rich episode one</a>. Uzumaki transformed from beautifully chilling into a low-budget nightmare in the space of a week – it was a rug-pull scarier than anything Junji Ito could write.  </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Box Office Bombs</h2><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/08/15/borderlands-movie-criticism-uwe-boll-1723718855132.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Borderlands</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Unfortunately, terrible adaptations weren’t limited to the small screen. One of the biggest box office bombs of the year came in the form of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/borderlands-review-cate-blanchett-kevin-hart-jack-black">Borderlands</a>. Gearbox’s wacky looter shooter was transformed into a hideously miscast Guardians of the Galaxy rip-off for its live-action big screen adventure. Many of the games’ best-know qualities, such as its sweary sense of humour and love of turning humans into piles of goopy gore, were toned down to the point of vanishing completely. The result was bland, recycled MCU-ish ideas geared toward mass marketability. In short: a complete disaster. Unsurprisingly it <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/disastrous-borderlands-movie-ends-its-theater-run-with-just-31-million">died an unceremonious death</a> when it launched in cinemas – with Lionsgate’s CEO saying <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/lionsgate-ceo-on-borderlands-movie-nearly-everything-that-could-go-wrong-did-go-wrong">“nearly everything that could go wrong did go wrong.”</a></p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s arguable that an FPS like Borderlands was never going to survive the transition to cinema. A sequel to the most profitable comic book movie of all time and the first R-rated film to pass a billion-dollars at the box office, though? Surely a second Joker was going to be an easy win. Not so much. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/joker-folie-deux-review-joaquin-phoenix-lady-gaga-todd-phillips">Joker: Folie à Deux turned out to be a miserably dull follow-up</a>, with director Todd Phillips undoing almost all the good he established in the first film. When not even Lady Gaga can save your kinda-sorta musical from its snoozefest courtroom drama scenes, you know you’re in trouble. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">For the classic-mould movie buff, though, almost certainly the biggest disappointment of the year is Megalopolis. The years-in-the-making, self-financed magnum-opus from The Godfather director Francis Ford Coppola was (perhaps, if we’re honest, somewhat predictably) an indulgent catastrophe. Some people have seen method in the madness (including our own reviewer, who <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/megalopolis-review-francis-ford-coppola-adam-driver">gave it a 9/10</a>) but for many this opulent fable set in a futuristic, Rome-like New York City was a bloated, pretentious, dull mess. Quite how the creator of the quintessential Mafia movie got here may prove to be one of the universe’s greatest mysteries.  </p><p data-cy="paragraph">From studio closures to box office catastrophes, 2024 has had some real low points. It’s hard to find a silver lining in some of them, and we continue to hope that the industries that make our favourite things will turn a better corner in 2025. But in other instances it’s the downs that make the ups shine brightly – and you can find many of those bright stars in our roundup of the best reviewed games of 2025. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Matt Purslow is IGN's Senior Features Editor. </em></p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>
