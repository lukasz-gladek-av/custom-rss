That episode, which begins on June 11, picks up directly after the fallout of the Guardian’s battle with the Witness, and transforms Nessus. Echoes is Vex-themed, so players can expect to dig into the weird new behaviors these mechanical adversaries exhibit post-Witness and uncover secrets from lost civilizations as they repel the time-traveling enemy faction in a new three-player offensive activity.</p><p>After Echoes, Revenant will center the Fallen as they look for a new home in the galaxy. Without a home world, which was destroyed by the Witness, it’s time for the Eliksni people to settle down somewhere new. Bungie has touted that this episode will have heavy “dark fantasy” themes, including some vampire-slaying aesthetics. Some of the armor and weapons teased for Revenant have a blend of gothic and high-tech influences, and it sounds like it’ll be a remarkably fun romp.<br></p><p>Revenant is also introducing potion crafting to <em>Destiny 2</em>, and it isn’t what you might expect.

Moreover, Reynolds says that throughout year 10 of <em>Destiny 2</em>, the team is hoping to give players more agency in their pursuits, and potion crafting seems like a means to that end.<br></p><p>The final episode of the year will apparently shake up the “Hive pantheon,” as a new “eldritch force” begins disrupting things. The new mysteries of the episode will lead players back to the Dreadnaught, which <em>Destiny 2 </em>players may recall as the hulking ship of Oryx, The Taken King, from <em>Destiny</em>’s major 2015 expansion. The Dreadnaught was so massive that it was a destination unto itself, and it will be returning in the episode Heresy to bookend <em>Destiny 2</em>’s tenth year. Like Nessus in the first episode, the intent seems to be to give the Dreadnaught a facelift, and Bungie seems to be leaning toward a theme of decay with the environment and the weapons in this episode. It will also feature two armor sets, one inspired by fan-favorite character Eris Morn and the other by what the navigator of the Dreadnaught may look like.<br></p><p>Beyond this year of storytelling, Bungie closed things out with a tease of <em>Destiny 2</em>’s eleventh year, which is codenamed Frontiers.

<p>The sports betting industry has experienced significant growth recently, and Innovate Change, a leading name in market analysis, examines the key trends fueling this expansion.</p>



<h2 id="h-innovate-change-sports-betting-industry-outlook-set-for-14-growth-by-2030">Innovate Change Sports Betting Industry Outlook: Set for 14% Growth by 2030</h2>



<p>The sports betting industry has experienced significant growth recently, escalating from a market size of $109.01 billion in 2023 to an anticipated $114.68 billion in 2024, marking a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 5.2%. Looking ahead, the sports betting sector is expected to see a robust 14% growth by 2030, with a steady expansion projected in the ensuing years.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.innovatechange.co.nz/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Innovate Change</a> is a leading name in market analysis, examines the key trends fueling this expansion.

These factors are creating big opportunities for everyone involved, from companies to bettors. Innovate Change’s detailed study highlights these changes, predicting a significant boost in both the economy and innovation in sports betting over the next decade.</p>

<h2 id="h-uk-sports-betting-trends-navigating-new-norms">UK Sports Betting Trends: Navigating New Norms</h2>



<p>In the UK, the sports betting landscape has undergone significant changes, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic, leading to a surge in eSports betting due to increased digital engagement. A key insight from a prominent betting platform revealed that in 2020, nearly 70% of online betting revenue stemmed from mobile usage.</p>



<p>The sector, which ranked just below online casinos in revenue generation as per the UK Gambling Commission (UKGC), faced regulatory changes on 12 September 2022 to protect vulnerable bettors. These changes were aimed at curbing impulsive gambling habits and required betting companies to modify their marketing approaches while ensuring adherence to stricter guidelines.</p>



<p>Despite these regulatory adjustments, the UK sports betting market 2024 has continued to experience stable growth, with enhanced public trust in the regulated environment bolstering the industry.</p>



<figure></figure>







<h2 id="h-us-sports-betting-a-growing-market">US Sports Betting: A Growing Market</h2>



<p>The US has seen substantial illegal betting, with figures reaching over $150 billion annually. To counter this, significant strides have been made towards legalizing sports betting, with more than 30 states now sanctioning it. This shift gained momentum after the Supreme Court overturned the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act in 2018, paving the way for online sports betting to thrive.</p>



<h2 id="h-india-s-betting-steady-and-unrestricted">India’s Betting: Steady and Unrestricted</h2>



<p>Unlike the US and UK, India’s sports betting market, worth around 1.07 billion USD, has enjoyed uninterrupted growth, projected to expand at a rate of 9.79%. The country’s legal framework, originating from the Public Gaming Act of 1867, does not encompass online gambling, and this stance continued with the Information Technology Act of 2000. This legislative gap has allowed India’s sports betting scene to thrive without significant legal constraints.</p>



<h2 id="h-factors-fueling-growth-sports-betting">Factors Fueling Growth Sports Betting</h2>



<p>Innovate Change highlights several key factors contributing to the expected 14% growth in the sports betting industry by 2030:</p>



<p><strong>Technological Innovations:</strong> The adoption of cutting-edge technologies like artificial intelligence and blockchain is transforming the sports betting landscape. These technologies enhance security, improve transparency, and elevate the overall betting experience, drawing in a tech-savvy audience and expanding the market.</p>



<p><strong>Rise of Mobile Betting:</strong> The widespread use of smartphones has led to a surge in mobile betting. This trend offers unmatched convenience, allowing bettors to engage anytime and anywhere. Innovate Change anticipates that the ease of mobile betting will continue to attract users, significantly driving industry growth.</p>



<p><strong>Legislative Developments: </strong>Legal changes in various regions are liberalizing the sports betting market, creating new opportunities for legal betting activities. As these legislative landscapes evolve, they pave the way for industry expansion, attracting investments and increasing the global reach of sports betting.</p>



<h2 id="h-market-dynamics">Market Dynamics</h2>



<p>Innovate Change has identified several emerging trends in the expansion of betting varieties, which are reshaping the sports betting.</p>



<h3 id="h-expansion-of-betting-varieties">Expansion of Betting Varieties</h3>



<p>The market is witnessing a significant broadening of its offerings, extending beyond traditional win-lose bets to include in-play betting, virtual sports, and other innovative betting options. This diversification is enhancing the appeal of sports betting, attracting a wider audience keen on exploring new and engaging wagering experiences.</p>



<p><strong>Play Betting Growth:</strong> Real-time or in-play betting, where bets are placed during the event, is gaining traction. This interactive form of betting keeps bettors engaged, offering dynamic odds that change with the game’s progress, adding excitement and depth to the betting experience.</p>



<p><strong>Rise of Virtual Sports: </strong>Virtual sports betting, involving simulated games or events, is on the rise. These digital contests run on algorithms, offering continuous betting opportunities, independent of real-world sports calendars, thus providing a constant stream of action for bettors.</p>



<p><strong>Esports Betting: </strong>The esports sector is burgeoning, with betting on competitive video gaming becoming increasingly popular. As esports tournaments and leagues gain mainstream recognition, the betting market surrounding these events is expanding rapidly, attracting a younger, tech-savvy demographic.</p>



<p><strong>Novelty and Entertainment Bets:</strong> Betting is extending into non-sports areas, such as entertainment, politics, and other cultural events. These novelty bets offer a diverse range of wagering options, appealing to a broader audience beyond traditional sports bettors.</p>



<p><strong>Enhanced User Experiences:</strong> Operators are focusing on providing more engaging and immersive betting experiences. This includes improved mobile apps, interactive live streaming, and integrated social features, enhancing the overall user experience and satisfaction.</p>



<h3 id="h-geographical-market-dynamics">Geographical Market Dynamics</h3>



<p>With the increasing legalization and acceptance of sports betting in various regions, international betting operators are seizing opportunities to expand their global footprint. This trend is not only fueling industry growth in new markets, but also encouraging cross-border collaboration and strategic mergers, emphasizing the sector’s movement towards a more interconnected and expansive international environment.</p>



<p>Europe remains the leading region in the sports betting market, commanding over 37% of the global share in 2024. It is projected to continue its growth trajectory at a rate of nearly 10% through to 2030. The liberal stance on gambling in many European countries, coupled with a long history of legalized betting, underpins this expansion. For instance, the United Kingdom, where sports betting has been legal since 1960, boasts some of the most well-established legal frameworks for sports betting, although it has recently introduced more stringent advertising regulations. The online betting sector in Europe, particularly, has experienced significant growth, fueled by retail betting activities, with projections estimating the market to reach around US $40 billion by 2030.</p>



<p>In Asia, the sports betting market is anticipated to grow at an 11% rate leading up to 2030. This growth is primarily driven by an increasing number of people gaining access to sports betting online. Furthermore, a trend towards the legalization of the gambling industry in various Asian countries is contributing to this expansion, with some nations opening up their markets to both local and international players.</p>



<h2 id="h-esports-influence-on-industry-growth">eSports Influence on Industry Growth</h2>



<p>The eSports sector has played a significant role in propelling the growth of the industry, with projections indicating a 12% increase, marking it as one of the key growth drivers. The surge in eSports popularity is largely due to enhanced mobile technology, improved live streaming capabilities, and the expansion of internet infrastructure globally. The rise of multiplayer gaming and the organization of major eSports tournaments across various countries have elevated eSports to a crucial industry sector.</p>



<p>Currently, the eSports betting market experiences the fastest growth rate among all categories, anticipated to maintain a 14% growth trajectory up to 2030. This rapid expansion is particularly notable in regions where eSports is still developing, suggesting a potential for significant impact in these areas. Asia leads in eSports popularity, with Europe following closely as a strong contender in the market. This widespread acceptance and engagement with eSports are expected to continue driving the sector’s growth, underscoring its importance in the broader industry.</p>



<h2 id="h-the-role-of-ai-in-sports-betting">The Role of AI in Sports Betting</h2>



<p>Today, with 60% of the global population having access to the internet, the sports betting industry is witnessing a significant transformation driven by artificial intelligence (AI). AI’s integration into this sector is enhancing the user experience through personalized betting recommendations, real-time odds calculations, and advanced analytics for predicting outcomes. The technology’s ability to process vast amounts of data quickly and accurately is providing bettors with more informed insights, leading to more strategic betting decisions. As AI continues to evolve, its impact on the sports betting is expected to grow, offering more sophisticated and immersive betting experiences to users worldwide. Innovate Change recognizes the potential of AI to revolutionize the industry, making it a key factor in the predicted growth and expansion of sports betting by 2030.</p>



<h3 id="h-the-impact-of-ai-on-sports-betting-sites">The Impact of AI on Sports Betting Sites</h3>



<p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) is significantly reshaping betting sites, offering a range of benefits that enhance the overall gambling experience. Here’s how AI is making a difference:</p>



<p><strong>Personalization: </strong>AI algorithms analyze player behavior to tailor game recommendations, betting options, and promotions that suit individual preferences, enhancing user engagement and retention.</p>



<p><strong>Improved Decision-Making: </strong>AI provides bettors with advanced analytics and predictive models, offering insights into game outcomes, betting trends, and player performance, which aid in making more informed betting decisions.</p>



<p><strong>Enhanced Security: </strong>AI-driven security systems can detect and prevent fraudulent activities by monitoring and analyzing patterns of behavior, ensuring a safer gambling environment for users.</p>



<p><strong>Customer Support: </strong>AI-powered chatbots and virtual assistants offer 24/7 customer support, providing quick and efficient responses to player inquiries, improving the overall customer service experience.</p>



<p><strong>Efficient Operations:</strong> AI streamlines casino and betting site operations by automating routine tasks, analyzing gaming data for insights, and optimizing the management of resources, leading to cost savings and improved service quality.</p>



<p><strong>Responsible Gaming:</strong> AI tools can identify potential problem gambling behaviors by monitoring playing patterns and can intervene with tailored support or restrictions to promote responsible gaming practices.</p>



<h2 id="h-the-rise-of-cryptocurrency-in-sports-betting">The Rise of Cryptocurrency in Sports Betting</h2>



<figure></figure>







<p>The sports betting arena is broadening, with the integration of cryptocurrencies marking a significant trend. Since its inception in 2009, the appeal of cryptocurrencies, especially Bitcoin, skyrocketed, with 2021 witnessing peak interest. Despite the inherent volatility, around 50% of Bitcoin transactions are linked to online gaming and betting sectors.</p>



<p>The surge in Bitcoin’s value at the end of 2020, coupled with its advantages such as anonymity, global reach, swift transactions, and enticing bonuses, has propelled a significant portion of bettors towards crypto betting. This shift reflects the industry’s agility in adopting innovative solutions to enhance user experiences. Crypto betting not only epitomizes the sector’s adaptability but also sets the stage for integrating more advanced payment technologies in the future, further revolutionizing the sports betting.</p>



<h2 id="h-conclusion">Conclusion</h2>



<p>Wrapping up, the insightful analysis by Innovate Change paints an optimistic future for the sports betting industry, anticipating a robust growth of 14% by the year 2030. This upward trend is chiefly propelled by the advent of cutting-edge technology, the increasing popularity of mobile betting, and progressive changes in global betting regulations. Additionally, the diversification of betting options and the international scaling of operations are broadening the market’s horizon.</p>



<p>Particularly noteworthy is the explosive rise of eSports betting, which is rapidly becoming a dominant force in the market, alongside substantial market contributions from Europe and Asia, highlighting the industry’s extensive global footprint.</p>



<p>Artificial Intelligence (AI) is playing a pivotal role, revolutionizing the sector by offering improved personalization, smarter decision-making tools, enhanced security features, more efficient customer service, and bolstering the efforts towards promoting responsible gambling practices. These AI-driven advancements are set to elevate the betting experience to new heights of convenience and reliability.</p>



<p>Innovate Change continues to lead the charge in delivering cutting-edge analyses and predictions, equipping both industry insiders and enthusiasts with the knowledge to adeptly navigate the evolving sports betting landscape. By 2030, technological innovations, market expansion, and strategic industry maneuvers are expected to transform the sports betting realm. This will usher in an era of unprecedented opportunities, engaging experiences, and sustained growth.</p>

It’s part of a surprise content update for <em>Starfield</em> that’s been a <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/todd-howard-confirms-starfield-creation-kit-mod-support-will-launch-in-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">very long time coming</a>, as this is the longest a mainline Bethesda sandbox RPG has gone without an official modding toolkit out and about.</p>
 <p data-characters="330" data-current-count="330" data-injectable="false">Up until now, modders couldn’t access the full breadth of customization and game-building features that were used to make <em>Starfield</em> in the first place. The release of the Creation Kit means this is no longer the case, however, and it should now be substantially easier to integrate complex, game-changing mods into the game.</p> <p data-characters="476" data-current-count="806" data-injectable="true">This brings us to the second major aspect of the Creation Kit’s release, of course: the in-game Creations modding platform. While the majority of modders are bound to continue using services such as the <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/starfield" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nexus mod hosting website</a>, many will also use the Creations interface nestled within <em>Starfield </em>itself. This service allows modders to collaborate with Bethesda to sell mods for real-world currency, which is either neat or devious, depending on how you look at things.</p>
 <p data-characters="462" data-current-count="462" data-injectable="true">The most important feature of Creations, however, is the fact that it’s also accessible on consoles, which means Xbox players can now install a more curated selection of mods in much the same way as PC players can. The gulf between Creations mods and Nexus mods is bound to grow wider as time goes on, mind, as Creations offerings do not get to use the <em>Starfield</em> Script Extender and other important modding tools, but that’s just how these things go.</p>
 <p data-characters="158" data-current-count="158" data-injectable="false">Whatever the case may be, the modding floodgates are now fully open for <em>Starfield</em>, and who knows what type of player-made content might be on the horizon now.</p>

			<p>Following the <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-world-aeternum-brings-the-mmo-to-consoles-with-cross-play-new-10-player-raid-coming/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announcement</a> of New World: Aeternum at Summer Game Fest 2024, we caught up with some lead figures from Amazon Games Orange County to dive into the console launch and the various improvements coming to the existing PC version.</p>
<p>We chatted with Scott Lane (Game Director), Katie Kaczynski (Senior Producer), and David Fairfaye (Creative Director). As a reminder, the new version of the MMORPG will go live on October 15.</p>
<figure><figcaption>'I think of it more of a spiritual successor because it's got three years of learnings and improvements that we made on the PC and then a whole bunch of new stuff that we've added.'</figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>Let's start with the big one. What differentiates New World: Aeternum from the live PC version?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Scott Lane:</strong> I think of it more of a spiritual successor because it's got three years of learnings and improvements that we made on the PC and then a whole bunch of new stuff that we've added.&nbsp; Some of the big differentiators are the way we tell people the story is new, the way we tell the story's new.</p>
<p>Those special close-up dialogue cameras, the in-game cinematics we've added. You'll see new pre-rendered cinematics as well at launch. Beyond that, the beach questing is similar but vastly improved. The time to max level is streamlined. I think streamlined is a word I'm probably gonna use a lot because the console audience wants things faster and more clear. We made the game soloable from beginning to end. Doesn't mean you have to play solo. You can play with a group, you can play solo, it's really your option. It still has the MMO back end.</p>
<p>But we've done a lot of focus around making it play and feel more like an action RPG. We've added swimming. We've added a new raid at the endgame. We've taken our solo trials and we've made end-game versions of those that you can play through repeatedly.</p>
<p>We've added a PvP zone. What am I forgetting?</p>
<p><strong>David Fairfaye:</strong> Gear score increase, matchmaking.</p>
<p><strong>Scott Lane:</strong> Oh yes, matchmaking for our 3v3 PvP Arena.</p>
<p><strong>David Fairfaye:</strong> The other thing we discussed earlier is that the controller support is just better. Now you can remap controls, you have lock on, you have aim assist, so that controller experience has been enhanced from what's currently on live.</p>
<p><strong>Scott Lane:</strong> Also, you have camera choices now between player relative or camera relative camera, which is very different for some players depending on which one you choose. If you played the game, like, at launch for New World, it'd be easier to describe what hasn't changed rather than what has changed.</p>
<p><strong>Can you talk a little bit about the class archetypes that are being introduced in New World: Aeternum?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Katie Kaczynski:</strong> We wanted to make this a really easy game to just hop into. So, if you have a favorite weapon that you play in a different game, or there's a specific kind of fantasy that you were thinking about for your character, you can very easily start with that.</p>
<p>New World: Aeternum is still a classless game, so your weapon is really your class. But this is a great way to start with this embodiment and definition of who your character is at the beginning, and then you can change and roll to whatever you want it to be as you journey through the game.</p>
<p><strong>You also talked about the improved quest flow from level 1 to 65. Is that going to be in terms of just pacing for how experience is doled out, or are you redesigning those quests?</strong></p>
<p><strong>David Fairfaye: </strong>I'll take that. I think it's both. We've definitely worked a lot on the quest flow. The NPCs move with you. You can go to an area, and there's a lot of quests around, so there's less sort of like having to run for running's sake. The story sort of moves with you.</p>
<p>The other big thing we wanted to do is that there's no grind for grind's sake in terms of the story, right? As you progress, you naturally level up and the story just gets you to max level so you don't have to do extra stuff, just the story.</p>
<p><strong>Scott Lane:</strong> It is also notably faster to get to max level than in the previous version. It probably takes about half of the time. But it's worth mentioning that once you get to max level, that's when the game opens up. You get to the end game and there's all kinds of crazy, fun stuff to do.</p>
<figure><figcaption>'It is also notably faster to get to max level than in the previous version. It probably takes about half of the time.'</figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>Yeah. Even in the brief hands-on, I got to level 11, got through introductory quests, and was opening up new weapon skills and new combos to experiment with. Are there any changes in the crafting and trading systems from the PC release?</strong></p>
<p><strong>David Fairfaye: </strong>Not too many. The big thing we've done is we've tried to streamline some of the crafting so you progress a little bit faster. We've made some of the recipes for jewel crafting a little simpler, so there's one main recipe for the different types, and then you add different stones to it. Little things like that just sort of make it easier to level up.</p>
<p><strong>Okay. Do you see some of these changes making their way back into the live PC version?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Katie Kaczynski: </strong>Oh, they're gonna get all this. For the folks that are currently playing, if they purchased the Rise of the Angry Earth DLC last year, they're going to get everything.</p>
<p>If you have the base game, you're gonna get some of what we talk about when it comes to the new content and new features. So, we're gonna keep the console and PC at parity. Everything that is coming to the console is coming to the PC.</p>
<p><strong>David Fairfaye: </strong>And that's important for crossplay, right? One of the big things is that PC users can play with console users. They can play in the same worlds, so they always have to be on the same build.</p>
<p><strong>Does that mean New World on PC will change, or rather, essentially disappear, and that Aeternum will take its place?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Scott Lane: </strong>I wouldn't say disappearing. I think it's just gonna be rebranded to match the branding of where we are now with the franchise.</p>
<p><strong>Katie Kaczynski: </strong>The way that I describe it is if you played right at launch, the game has changed so much. It's a completely different game. We redid the entire main story quest line. It's totally brand new. If you're playing today, and you're a current player, then it's just a continuation of your journey. Your progression continues. This is gonna drop on October 15th, and you're just gonna keep playing and having fun, either on your main or on a fresh start world. If you're on console, you get all of this from day one, and it's just like Aeternum is the ultimate New World experience.</p>
<p><strong>Scott Lane: </strong>There'll be a lot more people to buy your stuff on the trading post from October 15th.</p>
<p><strong>Will you launch new worlds, like fresh start worlds, with New World: Aeternum?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Katie Kaczynski: </strong>Yes.</p>
<p><strong>Nice. What do players get when they buy into the game on consoles?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Scott Lane: </strong>Do you mean like pre-order?</p>
<p><strong>Either pre-order or the editions that are out there.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Katie Kaczynski: </strong>There's a standard edition and then we have a deluxe edition that comes with a bear mount, so that's super exciting. And then there's also a pre-order bonus. That's the dire wolf mount called the Azoth Stalker. That's also actually available on PC. While that is a pre-order bonus, it is available to our PC players as well who are currently playing. All they have to do is log in between June 7th and October 14th in order to get that, and then on October 15th, they'll be able to grab that.</p>
<p><strong>I was going to ask if there was a loyalty program for people who are already on PC and have a New World account but might want to start up on consoles. </strong></p>
<p><b>Scott Lane: </b>Well, on console, no, but on PC, I think it was really important for us that anything, like the Azoth Stalker mount pre-order bonus, would be there as well. We didn't want to give something to the consoles that the PC players wouldn't have access to. It just didn't seem fair for all the support they've given us. And it's the same with the content. We really wanted to just make the PC game better for those who bought Rise of the Angry Earth as a thank you for hanging in there and sticking around with this and being a good partner.</p>
<p><strong>On PC, will you still have the same controller support and the lock-on features?</strong></p>
<p>Yes. We have total parity. So you can lock on, I think the default is middle mouse button. It feels great.</p>
<p><strong>Scott Lane: </strong>Or you can play on controller on PC.</p>
<p><strong>On the other hand, can you play with keyboard and mouse on consoles?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Scott Lane: </strong>Yes. I've never tried it.</p>
<p><strong>Good to know it's there as an option. As far as the expansion content goes, in the little bit that I played, I did see a hook. There was a quest item that you could pick up for the Elysian Wilds. I mentioned that you did not have access to that expansion in the bit I played.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Scott Lane: </strong>You saw that here?</p>
<p><strong>Yeah, there was a mudstain note in the city you could walk up to that was just sitting on a chest. When you click that, it says you need access to this expansion, and you have to be level 25.</strong></p>
<p>Oh, no, you just have to be level 25. It was gated by level, not the expansion.</p>
<p><strong>Okay. The tooltip kind of said both things for some reason. I wondered if Elysian Wilds was included with the base game. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Scott Lane: </strong>Do you mean the base console game?</p>
<p><strong>Yeah</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Katie Kaczynski: </strong>So, for the Standard and Deluxe edition on consoles, both of those have everything wrapped up and included. They get it all. On PC, there's still a base game where some people may not have the DLC on PC. That won't happen on console since everything is included.</p>
<p><strong>Okay. So, there isn't a piecemeal way to buy specific expansions on consoles?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Katie Kaczynski: </strong>It all comes nicely wrapped in a bow, ready to go for that.</p>
<p><strong>Scott Lane: </strong>New World: Aeternum includes everything that has shipped to date and all the new stuff.</p>
<figure><figcaption>'We're continuously balancing PVP, and I think with this release, we will make a very big effort to bring all the weapons up to parity and balance the game.'</figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>Cool. Have you talked about any of the PVP rebalancing that you guys are doing for New World: Aeternum?</strong></p>
<p><strong>David Fairfaye: </strong>We're continuously balancing PVP, and I think with this release, we will make a very big effort to bring all the weapons up to parity and balance the game.</p>
<p><strong>The 15 weapon types that are in New World: Aeternum, is that everything that's in the base game? There's no new weapon types this time around?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Katie Kaczynski:</strong> Correct. For the console version, everything is in the base game, I just want to make that clear. There is a flail that's gated behind the Rise of the Angry Earth DLC on PC.</p>
<p><strong>With the cross-play feature, is there cross-communication and cross-platform guild support?</strong></p>
<p><strong>David Fairfaye: </strong>Absolutely, yeah. You can join guilds with people on any platform, you can chat with them, you can make friends with them.</p>
<p><strong>Katie Kaczynski: </strong>You can run the influence races together, you can take over the territory together, you can fight wars together, you can do all that. It's awesome.</p>
<p><strong>For consoles, are you guys talking about if there's graphic versus performance modes available for players?</strong></p>
<p><strong>David Fairfaye: </strong>Yeah, we do have a 4K mode. We have performance and quality. The goal of performance is to always be at 60. In Quality mode, you'll sometimes dip a little bit, but it gives you all the best visuals. The shadows are deeper, and the lighting's a little better, so you can sort of choose what's best for you.</p>
<p><strong>Are you guys utilizing AMD FSR or any additional rendering options for consoles/PC?</strong></p>
<p><strong>David Fairfaye: </strong>Yes, we are. We're using an upscaler.</p>
<p><strong>Scott Lane:</strong> I believe it's FSR.</p>
<p><strong>David Fairfaye: </strong>One other thing about the rendering: it's worth mentioning we'll be bringing HDR in with this release, which I think will be really great for those with HDR displays.</p>
<figure><figcaption>'Finally bringing a raid to New World is something players have been asking for for a long time. This is a full and true raid. It's that challenging content players have been waiting for.'</figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>Awesome. I guess from each of you, is there one, like, particular feature or something that stands out for the launch of New World: Aeternum that is something you've wanted to do from the base game that you can finally do?</strong></p>
<p><strong>David Fairfaye: </strong>I'll start because I always say this. I know Katie wants to say something.</p>
<p><strong>Katie Kaczynski: </strong>I do want to say it!</p>
<p><strong>David Fairfaye: </strong>My favorite is the raid. I think finally bringing a raid to New World is something that players have been asking for for a long time. This is a full and true raid. It's a three-boss experience, and I think, you know, it's part of that end game. It's that challenging content players have been waiting for.</p>
<p><strong>Katie Kaczynski: </strong>That first boss is my favorite. It looks very different from what we've done. It acts very different from what we've done. Really different mechanics throughout the whole thing with each of the bosses, but that one, I love the way it looks. But the thing that I'm excited about is actually the Lawless Zone.</p>
<p>I think that - I love our faction system. I play into it. I played each different faction type on each of my characters. But I'm really looking forward to getting into this lawless area where factions don't matter. I think this is gonna be the coolest thing. And we're gonna have more information on that coming up in a Forged in Aeternum episode where we kind of dig into that. I'm super stoked to do that episode, it's my favorite thing.</p>
<p><strong>Scott</strong> <strong>Lane:</strong> For me, I'm like a 90/10 player. 90% of the time, I want to be alone, but I like to know there are people around. The 10 percent I group is only really out of requirements in a game, so I am really pumped about having the solo experience from beginning to end and having some endgame solo activities and things that I can just do by myself.</p>
<p>Part of that is the enhanced dialogue system, almost like the RPG storytelling systems we've added. I think combined, those two make the game something I would have loved to have gotten from the beginning.</p>
<p><strong>Thank you all very much for your time.</strong></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24175403/new-donald-duck-movie-short-diy-duck<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="3Y8gUa"><a href="https://www.polygon.com/century-of-disney/23603428/donald-duck-horny-as-hell-three-caballeros-saludos-amigos">Donald Duck</a>, arguably tied with Goofy as the second most recognizable Disney character  after Mickey Mouse, starred in over 150 short films throughout the 1930, ’40s, ’50s, and ’60s. 2024 marks the 90th anniversary of the pantsless Pekin, who persisted through the second half of the 20th century thanks to Disney Channel replays of his shorts, appearances in <em>DuckTales</em>, and the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23018966/kingdom-hearts-4-announcement-trailer-release-date">Kingdom Hearts games</a>. </p>
<p id="x48euw">Disney is celebrating the duck’s birthday with the usual merch drops and theme park shenanigans, but its best gift to fans is a brand-new short: <em>DIY Duck</em>, Donald’s first solo short outing since 1961’s <em>The Litterbug</em>. Directed by veteran Mark Henn, who has remained on Disney’s hand-drawn animation team throughout the quarter-century pivot to 3D CG,  <em>DIY Duck</em> checks all the boxes of a classic Donald short, starting with a mundane day-in-the-life problem that puts the character through the cartoon wringer.</p>
<div id="hpbUOu"><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ncEza6z_SwE?rel=0&amp;start=1" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share;"></iframe></p></div>
<p id="AJig7d">Donald was always my favorite cartoon character: Landing between the more wholesome Disney gang and Tex Avery and Chuck Jones’ elastic, ecstatic WB cast, Donald was just... some dude... trying to learn how the world works and get by. His temper could run hot, but he was solutions-oriented. He wanted to make a buck, but wasn’t anything like Scrooge McDuck. His curiosity and zest for life meant Disney could drop him into a PSA every now and then — Donald wanted to learn, and we wanted to learn with him. I will dig up what might be his greatest adventure, <em>Donald in Mathmagic Land</em>, once a year just to remind myself that, yeah, math rules.</p>

<p id="lVGupM">These days, Donald’s mostly a relic, playing second fiddle to Mickey in the rare instances when Disney approves its mascot character for media use. That’s a bummer, and <em>DIY Duck</em> is a great reminder. Today’s more sophisticated toons are often fantastical and larger than life even when speaking to nuanced human experiences. So it’s kinda nice to have a modern short, simple yet stylish in its cartooning, that is about fixing a crack in a wall — something that I, like Donald, would be absolutely terrible at. In a neat throwback, <em>DIY Duck</em> also pays tribute to Donald’s classic rage voice by using archive clips of Clarence “Ducky” Nash, who voiced the character for 50 years.</p>
<p id="9Hm7Ml">While Disney maintains a hand-drawn department, the company mostly deploys it for stunts (like <em>DIY Disney</em> and <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23915430/once-upon-a-studio-disney-short-robin-williams-genie-ai">last year’s <em>Once Upon a Studio</em> short</a>) and skeletal work on 3D CG features. During a visit to Walt Disney Animation for 2014’s <em>Big Hero 6</em>, I was fortunate to watch Henn in action, cartooning by hand for a scene that would later be painted over and rendered with the finished CG art. Whether Disney will ever make a new hand-drawn feature — or, heck, a steady stream of Donald shorts! — is unclear, but by keeping Henn and the team on board, the studio implicitly understands the soul of the medium, whether it’s breathing life into 3D characters or reviving a legacy for an act of tribute. I’m just hoping this isn’t the last time we see Donald in this form over the <em>next</em> 60 years.</p>

The event, which runs several times a year, acts as a hub for in-development titles to offer demos. We’ve been through the latest batch to highlight some of the best from the event, which runs from June 10 through 17.<br></p><p>Games seen during the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/steam-next-fest-best-game-demos-1851230698/slides/3&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/steam-next-fest-best-game-demos-1851230698/slides/3">previous Steam Next Fest</a></span>, since released to widespread acclaim, include the religious horror title <em>Indika</em>, the <em>Resident-Evil</em>-inspired<em> </em><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/crow-country-indie-survival-horror-review-1851462202&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/crow-country-indie-survival-horror-review-1851462202"><em>Crow Country</em></a></span>, and noir parody <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/duck-detective-secret-salami-how-long-1851497669&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/duck-detective-secret-salami-how-long-1851497669"><em>Duck Detective</em></a></span>.

The latest demo for the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/shin-megami-tensei-v-the-kotaku-review-1848102235&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/shin-megami-tensei-v-the-kotaku-review-1848102235"><em>Shin Megami Tensei</em></a></span>-inspired game brings more of the same goodness: b-horror vibes and exciting strategy combat. The game’s horror aesthetic and non-high school cast make it a nice variation from the <em>SMT/Persona</em> formula, and I can’t wait to play more. Thankfully, we finally have a release date.</p></div><div><p>Release Date: September 9, 2024</p><p>If you’ve played Triband’s other absurdist comedy games <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/what-the-golf-turns-everything-into-golf-and-its-great-1838755154&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/what-the-golf-turns-everything-into-golf-and-its-great-1838755154"><em>What The Golf?</em></a></span> <em>And What The Bat?</em> then you somewhat know what to expect with <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/2727650/WHAT_THE_CAR/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2727650/WHAT_THE_CAR/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>What The Car?</em> </a></span>This time, players will take control of a car with legs, on an adventure through silly platforming levels. The demo gives you just enough silliness to assure you the game still has the same humor as its predecessors. The full release promises a range of activities, including fishing, swimming, and singing “CAR-aoke.”</p></div><div><p>Release Date: TBD</p><p>When first looking at <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/2545220/Tormenture/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2545220/Tormenture/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Tormenture</em></a></span>, I immediately compared it to the indie horror/deck-builder/roguelike game <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/the-hot-new-card-game-by-the-m-night-shyamalan-of-vide-1848027922&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/the-hot-new-card-game-by-the-m-night-shyamalan-of-vide-1848027922"><em>Inscryption</em></a></span>. <em>Tormenture</em> is a nostalgia-fueled game inspired by classic ‘80s titles, but it twists that into a terrifying metanarrative with layers of puzzles and mystery to uncover. The demo pulls you into a game that constantly shifts itself in form, taking on the styles of retro games such as Atari’s <em>Adventure</em>. For lovers of classic games and meta-horror, <em>Tormenture</em> is a thrilling experience so far.</p></div><div><p>Release Date: July 25, 2024</p><p>&nbsp;<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/2596420/Arranger_A_RolePuzzling_Adventure/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2596420/Arranger_A_RolePuzzling_Adventure/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Arranger</em></a></span> is a challenging and extremely adorable entry in the 2024 micro-trend that is “map-based puzzle games.” I don’t know how many games are required for a micro-trend, but between this and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/paper-trail-origami-puzzle-game-impressions-1851497194&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/paper-trail-origami-puzzle-game-impressions-1851497194"><em>Paper Trail</em></a></span><em> </em>I’m just gonna go with it.</p><p>Like the latter,<em> Arranger</em>’s puzzles revolve around how the player interacts with and shifts the map of the game world. The tile-based maps are shifted as you move, almost like a conveyor built. Move forward and everything in a line moves forward with you until you wrap around the screen. Sliding and arranging (get it) the map to progress forward is a deceptively simple but challenging mechanic that the demo proves is delightful. </p></div><div><p>Release Date: TBD</p><p>If you have been <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/balatro-poker-roguelike-worth-it-is-it-good-review-pc-1851283124&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/balatro-poker-roguelike-worth-it-is-it-good-review-pc-1851283124"><em>Balatro</em></a></span>-pilled this year and are searching for your next gambling-adjacent gaming fix then <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/2400510/Dungeons__Degenerate_Gamblers/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2400510/Dungeons__Degenerate_Gamblers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Dungeons &amp; Degenerate Gamblers</em></a></span> is here for you. The roguelike adventure takes the form of gambling against a series of enemies in a tavern, in a game of blackjack (or twenty-one). You pick cards in hopes of getting the highest score without going bust. The twist is that the game isn’t just populated by a normal deck. Tarot, business, library, and note cards are all possible things you can draw, each with their own unique skills. Like <em>Balatro</em>, the random element creates situations in which you must roll with the deck and come up with new solutions to outsmart your enemy.</p></div><div><p>Release Date: August 1, 2024</p><p>I played a press demo for this <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/kitsune-tails-retro-platformer-sapphic-super-mario-1851526665&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/kitsune-tails-retro-platformer-sapphic-super-mario-1851526665">sapphic <em>Super Mario</em></a></span>-inspired retro-platformer and was charmed by the familiar mechanics and cute queer story. While I had some issues with finicky mechanics and design issues, the public demo fixes at least one of my problems—the invincibility power-up now has a clear indicator of its time limit—so developer Kitsune Games is working to make the game better. The Next Fest demo will give you a short taste of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/1325260/Kitsune_Tails/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1325260/Kitsune_Tails/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Kitsune Tails</em></a></span>’ beautiful pixelated world and make you fall in love with protagonist Yuzu.</p></div><div><p>Release Date: TBD</p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/1910600/ONE_BTN_BOSSES/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1910600/ONE_BTN_BOSSES/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>ONE BTN BOSSES</em></a></span> is a boss rush game in which you have a single button to press in each level. Sounds simple, but it isn’t. Each level adds new twists and mechanics to the single-button system. The core gameplay has you controlling a ship on a set track, with the ship moving on its own—you press a button to change direction, but that slows you down. The faster you go the faster you shoot, so it’s all about balancing speed and control as the enemy fires back at you. It’s a tightly designed mechanical marvel and the demo is the perfect taste of what’s to come.</p></div><div><p>Release Date: July 18, 2024</p><p>The beauty of the Soulsike genre is that there are so many variations on the FromSoftware formula. With <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/1832040/Flintlock_The_Siege_of_Dawn/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1832040/Flintlock_The_Siege_of_Dawn/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Flintlock</em></a></span>, developer A44 is focusing on high mobility, with combat that offers guns, swords, and magic to wield. Verticality is also a unique twist, with special abilities letting you move above enemies to unleash powerful attacks. A44 previously developed <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/ashen-is-a-dreamier-dark-souls-1830985170&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/ashen-is-a-dreamier-dark-souls-1830985170"><em>Ashen</em></a></span>, another great twist on the Soulsike genre, so I’m excited to see how they evolve that with <em>Flintlock</em>. So far, the demo delivers an impressive combat system, even if it still has some kinks to work out.</p></div><div><p>Release Date: TBD</p><p>One of the cutest visual novels on offer during Steam Next Fest is <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/2377250/Whimel_Academy/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2377250/Whimel_Academy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Whimel Academy</em></a></span>.

In the demo, you will get a taste of the game’s time management mechanics that have you picking and choosing the classes you want to take, and with whom you want to spend your time. All of this will culminate in what type of witch or wizard you become, as well as any romance you might find yourself in the middle of.</p></div><div><p>Release Date: July 18, 2024</p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/1519710/SCHiM/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1519710/SCHiM/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>SCHiM</em></a></span>’s demo confirms that the 3D platformer is just as charming to play as it is to <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://www.kotaku.com.au/2021/06/an-entire-game-where-you-have-to-keep-to-the-shadows/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.kotaku.com.au/2021/06/an-entire-game-where-you-have-to-keep-to-the-shadows/">look at</a></span>. Set in a monochromatic world of light and shadows, you control a little blob that can only step in the dark shadowy parts of the map. With busy city streets full of cars, pedestrians, strollers, ducks, and more that all create shadows, moving from point A to B becomes an adorable adventure.</p><hr><p>That’s ten picks for what you shouldn’t miss at Steam Next Fest, but it barely scratches the surface of what’s available. Once you’ve gotten through everything on this list, go see what else catches your eye.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

But Iizuka also says that he doesn’t actually “need” a gun because he’s powerful enough on his own. So there’s a bit of conflicting messaging about whether Shadow used guns in the 2005 game because he had to or because he wanted to.</p><p>“Yeah, in the games Shadow did use a gun,” Iizuka said. “But when we talk about Shadow, he would use whatever he needed in the moment to get the job done. So he would pick up a gun or ride a bike in order to get the job done – he’s that kind of character.</p><p>But he’s also extremely powerful on his own and doesn’t really need a gun or anything because he can do it himself – he is a weapon. So as long as there’s no need for Shadow to use a gun, he will probably not use one.”</p><p>Shadow’s levels in <em>Generations </em>do include a ranged attack in the form of his iconic Chaos Spear energy blast, and it functions similarly to how firearms did in the 2005 game. In a sense, it lines up with what Iizuka’s saying here because Shadow doesn’t need a weapon when he’s able to create those attacks himself. But ultimately, let’s just call Shadow’s arsenal in 2005 what it was: a very mid-2000s attempt at creating an edgier tone. It’s fun to look back on, but maybe not something we need to prioritize when looking back at Shadow’s history and recreate in the here and now.</p><p><em>Sonic X Shadow Generations </em>is coming to PC, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X/S, and Xbox One on October 25.

<p>One of the biggest gaming stories of the last month <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xbox-confirms-call-of-duty-black-ops-6-for-game-pass-on-day-one/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was the confirmation</a> that Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 would be on Xbox Game Pass day one. It’s the first game in the franchise to come to Microsoft’s subscription service, and it’s apparently something that the team at Treyarch — the developers of Black Ops 6 — didn’t find out that far in advance.</p>



<p>In an <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/xbox-focuses-on-impressive-games#%C2%A7item-a-cod-q-and-a" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">interview with Stephen Totilo</a>, Treyarch production director Yale Miller was asked about the game launching on Game Pass and how the meeting with Activision and Microsoft went.</p>



<p>“It wasn’t that long ago, frankly,” Miller said of when the team found out.</p>



<p>He continued: “I think it was a conversation, just internally with meeting with the Activision folks on those pieces, and talking about the opportunity for us. It was more like, ‘What does that mean?’”</p>







<p>Miller then touched on what made the jump to Xbox Game Pass exciting for the developers and the franchise as a whole. He talked about more people being able to try the game that may not have in the first place. There’s also the task of onboarding new players and introducing — or reintroducing — them to game modes.</p>



<p>“It’s been four years since [the last] Black Ops… Zombies is super deep rich,” Miller said. “It’s got quest lines and story. Some people just may not even remember that. With new players, how do you bring people into that universe?</p>



<p>“Sometimes we take for granted that a lot of people play Call of Duty and have been playing Call of Duty before. ‘Oh, they’ll get it. You know, they’ve played this before.’ So I think it has forced us to relook at some of that.”</p>



<p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 releases on October 25 for Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 5, PC, Xbox One, and PlayStation 4. As of publishing, there’s been no announcement whether the game will be available via Cloud gaming, which Ubisoft holds the rights to.</p>

<p>What do you think of the developers at Treyarch not finding out until shortly before the announcement that Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 would be on Xbox Game Pass?

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 Campaign Teaser | Xbox Games Showcase 2024</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">As seen in the screenshot below, Black Ops 6's Zombies storyline brings the return of Elizabeth Grey, Grigori Weaver, and Mac Carver from Black Ops Cold War's Requiem team, while Maya Aguinaldo is introduced as a new character to complete this cast of four.</p><p dir="ltr">One big complaint from Black Ops Cold War was the odd feeling of disconnect, as the game forced you to play as a BOCW operator skin instead of featuring a cast of story characters with unique voice lines. It also made for awkward moments when a player could exfil from a match as a Samantha Maxis operator skin, after completing the game's final story Easter egg, where Samantha devastatingly sacrificed herself to stop the Forsaken boss.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4316561-bo6-reveal-0282.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4316561" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4316561-bo6-reveal-0282.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4316561"></a><figcaption>Black Ops 6's Zombies cast.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4316561-bo6-reveal-0282.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">However, Treyarch did <a href="https://x.com/MrDalekJD/status/1799870429470883988" rel="nofollow ">confirm with Call of Duty content creators</a> that players would have a choice in who they played as, allowing for the choice of selecting a story character or a random operator skin from Black Ops 6.</p><p dir="ltr">Playing as part of the Zombies crew comes with the added bonus of immersion and unique character voice lines that include bits of story, while the choice to play as a random operator lets players simply slay the undead as one of the fancy operator skins they unlocked.</p><p dir="ltr">For more on Black Ops 6, make sure to check out all of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-release-date-beta-and-more-leak-ahead-of-xbox-showcase/1100-6524072/">our highlights from the big reveal</a>, including details on the campaign, multiplayer maps, and Treyarch's new omnidirectional movement system.</p><p dir="ltr">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 will be released on October 25 across PlayStation, PC, and Xbox, including a launch on Game Pass for day one.</p>

I haven't been talking publicly about this because right now is a time for us to focus on the team and the individuals.

<p dir="ltr">Despite being asked specifically about the reasons behind the fate of Tango Gameworks, Spencer kept his answers vague.</p><p dir="ltr">"In the end--I've said over and over--I have to run a sustainable business inside the company and [help it] grow, and that means sometimes I have to make hard decisions that, frankly, are not decisions I love, but decisions that somebody needs to go make," Spencer explained. "We will continue to go forward, we will continue to invest in what we're trying to go do in Xbox, and build the best business that we can, which ensures we can continue to do shows like the one we just did."</p><p dir="ltr">Throughout the interview, Spencer never once mentioned Tango Gameworks (or Arkane Austin, or any of the other recently shuttered studios) by name.</p><p dir="ltr">"For us, as the organization gets bigger, I think it's just more important that we can take bets together and try to do innovative, creative things, and that will continue to drive us," he added.</p><p dir="ltr">Spencer's words echoed sentiments recently shared by Xbox president Sarah Bond, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-president-tries-to-defend-shutdown-of-award-winning-hi-fi-rush-studio/1100-6523342/">who replied to questions about the closures</a> with a similar non-answer, saying, "We look at each studio, each game team, and we look at a whole variety of factors when we're faced with making decisions and trade-offs like that. But it all comes back to our long-term commitment to the games we create, the devices we build, the services, and ensuring we're setting ourselves up to be able to deliver on those promises."</p><p dir="ltr">Spencer did, however, give some specifics regarding the company's finances, stating, "We're up double digits every year over the last five years on game sales on Xbox consoles."</p>

The Series X will also get a special edition console in black that comes with 2TB of space and costs $599.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Additionally, Xbox stressed these new consoles have "the same speed and performance" as their predecessors.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Price-wise, these new consoles are roughly in line with the original $499/$299 pricing of the Series X|S at launch.

While this new Series S costs more, it puts the system closer to parity with its sibling console, albeit at the cost of being unable to play discs.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Handhelds may finally be in Xbox's future">Handhelds may finally be in Xbox's future</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Separately from the showcase, Spencer spoke of a potential Xbox handheld. Reports began circulating before the weekend, and he indicated to </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/hbYl4_y7N14">IGN</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> such a device may exist.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"I think we should have a handheld too," said Spencer. "The future for us in hardware is pretty awesome. We will have a time to come out and talk more about platform, and we can't wait to bring it to you."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Of the big three console makers, Microsoft is the only one that's yet to enter the handheld space.

<p data-characters="316" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">On display during both the Guerilla Collective event and the Latin American Games Showcase 2024, <em>Bittersweet Birthday </em>is an action-RPG that fuses <em>Soulslike </em>dodging with bullet hell chaos. The story-driven adventure is aiming for a specific type of challenge, and a demo is now live ahead of a planned Q2 2025 launch.</p> <p data-characters="418" data-current-count="418" data-injectable="true">The start of <em>Bittersweet Birthday</em> — which has World Eater Games developing and DANGEN Entertainment publishing — finds you waking up without any memories. As you attempt to flee the dangers lurking in this mysterious location, a voice comes through the speaker system and offers a means of escape. From there you’ll have to pick up the pieces of your past and venture forth through the challenges that await.</p>
 <p data-characters="133" data-current-count="133" data-injectable="false">You can get an idea of how the story unfolds and see some of the promised multi-phase boss battles in the announcement trailer below.</p> <figure data-current-count="433" data-injectable="true"><p> <iframe title="Bittersweet Birthday - Announcement trailer | PC, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation, Xbox" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ve53cyTDuvQ?feature=oembed&amp;enablejsapi=1&amp;origin=https://www.destructoid.com" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure>
 <p data-characters="267" data-current-count="267" data-injectable="false">The team at World Eater Games first launched an <a href="https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/bittersweet-birthday-a-game-of-heart-horror--2#/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Indiegogo campaign</a> for <em>Bittersweet Birthday </em>back in August 2021. 341 backers pushed it past its $23,000 goal to make development a possibility, and now you can try it for yourself in a demo that’s live on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1581100/Bittersweet_Birthday/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Steam</a>.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="350" data-current-count="617" data-injectable="true">Beyond the enigmatic narrative and intense battles, <em>Bittersweet Birthday </em>has a few ways for players to stretch out and relax in its world. There are mini games like darts and gachapon, the latter of which has 48 collectibles to pick up while playing. There are also side quests that give you a chance to hunt down secrets and unlock more Memories. &nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="292" data-current-count="292" data-injectable="false">The team cites a handful of inspirations, including <em>The Legend of Zelda: Majora’s Mask</em>, <em>Undertale</em>, <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-hyper-light-drifter/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hyper Light Drifter</a></em>, <em>OneShot</em>, and the <em>Monster Hunter </em>series. When <em>Bittersweet Birthday </em>launches next year, it will be available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, Nintendo Switch, and PC.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/mtg-secret-lair-x-hatsune-miku-digital-sensation-reveal-release-date/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=mtg-secret-lair-x-hatsune-miku-digital-sensation-reveal-release-date<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="286" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Wizards of the Coast has revealed the next Hatsune Miku crossover with <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/when-did-magic-the-gathering-come-out/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Magic: The Gathering</a></em>. It’s yet another Secret Lair drop comprised of six collectible cards that look stunning and will be well worth adding to your decks if you’re quick enough to get a copy of the set. </p> <p data-characters="486" data-current-count="486" data-injectable="true">This latest set is called the <em>MTG</em> Secret Lair × Hatsune Miku: Digital Sensation drop. It’s the second collaborative drop between the incredibly popular card game and global digital superstar Hatsune Miku. It’ll be available as part of the Secret Lair Summer Superdrop 2024, which you can pre-order from <strong>June 24, 2024, at 9 AM PT until July 14, 2024, at 11:59 PM PT</strong>. You’ll have to be quick, though, because I suspect this particular set is going to sell out quickly. </p>
 <h2 id="h-mtg-secret-lair-hatsune-miku-digital-sensation-is-all-you-need-for-a-magical-summer-of-tcg" data-injectable="false"><em>MTG</em> Secret Lair × Hatsune Miku: Digital Sensation is all you need for a magical summer of TCG</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Wizards of the Coast</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="338" data-current-count="638" data-injectable="true">The <em>MTG</em> Secret Lair × Hatsune Miku: Digital Sensation has six new cards for you to add to your collection. As you’d expect, each one is themed around the digital superstar Hatsune Miku. I’ve outlined every card in the set below so you know what to expect. My favorite is the one shown in the image above, Miku, Child of Song.</p>
 <ul data-found-items="6" data-current-count="240" data-injectable="false"> <li>1x Diabolic Tutor</li> <li>1x Chord of Calling</li> <li>1x Child of Alara as “Miku, Child of Song”</li> <li>1x Song of Creation</li> <li>1x Sol Ring</li> <li>1x Thespian’s Stage</li> </ul> <p data-characters="401" data-current-count="641" data-injectable="true">If, like me, you haven’t purchased a Secret Lair Superdrop for a while, you should know that Wizards of the Coast changed the system a little while ago. Superdrops and Secret Lair sets, in general, are now no longer printed to demand once a campaign finishes. Instead, there’s a limited number of everything on offer, so you might miss out if you don’t get your order in right away. </p>
 <p data-characters="267" data-current-count="267" data-injectable="false">This <em>MTG</em> Secret Lair × Hatsune Miku: Digital Sensation will almost certainly be a popular one that sells out faster than most. I tend to sit on Secret Lair drops for a while before I decide what I’m getting, but you won’t have that luxury with this one. </p> <figure data-current-count="567" data-injectable="true"><p> <iframe title="【LIVE】 M@GICAL☆CURE!

As a collector and art-lover, I adore these cards, but they’ve also opened me up to a library of music that I didn’t know I needed in my life and I love them all the more for that. </p>

Developer Full Circle has shared a fresh update on the next Skate game. While there is still no release date, the team has laid out several tweaks and additions coming to the series, many of which have been developed alongside feedback from various play tests. 
</p>
<p>
First off, the upcoming free-to-play game has a rebuilt Flick-It system in place. The developer said this will ensure each trick "feels as fun and satisfying to perform as ever before".
</p>
<p>
Thanks to this rebuild, in which added upgrades improve a player's accuracy and control, tricks in Skate should be easier than ever. "All of this work has been done with an eye to the future, so we can give the game plenty of room to grow as we add new tricks and techniques down the line," said senior gameplay designer Reid Buckmaster. Additionally, Skate will have a "streamlined" control system, which should make things easier for players to get to grips with.

<p>
Full Circle said while Skate will be fun to play solo, it is best experienced with others, and as such the team is including a number of 'social' features such as collaborative Pop-Up activities. 
</p>
<p>
There are also going to be a number of customisation options, with Full Circle confirming "almost everything" players do in the game will earn awards, which can then be used to change up characters and boards. These awards will also unlock placeable objects that can be popped into the world. 
</p>
<p>
As for its character creator, the team said it is bringing "as many options" as it can to the game, to allow for a more inclusive experience. This includes body shape, height, hairstyles and more. This is so Skate's players can "feel free to be whoever [they] want to be in San Van".
</p>

<p>
Ahead of Skate's release, the team is going to keep listening to its community's feedback. As such, it is encouraging more players to sign up to its <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/skate/insider-playtest-registration">Skate Insider program</a>. It confirmed console testing is scheduled for this autumn. 
</p>
<p>
On its eventual release, Skate will be coming to PlayStation, Xbox, PC and mobile. Furthermore, it will also have <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/eas-latest-skate-entry-is-live-service-free-to-play-game">cross-play and cross-progression support</a>.

            <p>
This week on the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/topics/newscast">Eurogamer Newscast</a>, we discuss <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/everything-announced-microsofts-xbox-games-showcase-black-ops-6-direct-2024">everything shown at the Xbox Showcase last night</a>: one of the best summer preview events in recent years, and one of Microsoft's best ever. </p>
<p>On the one hand, perhaps the trove of upcoming titles should be expected. After all, this is what you <em>should</em> get when you spend nearly $100bn buying up swathes of the games industry. On the other, well, Microsoft has seemed to perenially exist on promising that <em>next</em> year's crop of first-party games will finally be where its acquisition spree pays off, where Game Pass truly hits the big time, and where it at last starts clawing back some market share. </p>
<p>After watching the avalanche of announcements last night (Doom! Gears! Perfect Dark!) alongside everything else we knew was coming (Fable! Indy! More Diablo!) it's hard to see how the next 12 months couldn't make an impact - let alone the boost of launching Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 into Xbox Game Pass. Could Xbox finally feel like it's hitting its stride this console generation, after numerous misfires? Joining me this week are Eurogamer's Ed Nightingale and Victoria Kennedy to discuss.</p>

<!-- cache miss 124:single/related:cb2d34f057bd2b0b9b8f02cbd2e14037 --><!-- empty -->
<p>The <a href="https://sg.news.yahoo.com/2006-03-20-yet-another-microsoft-portable-media-gaming-device-rumor.html">extremely long-standing rumors</a> regarding Microsoft making a portable game console got a strong shot in the arm over the weekend from none other than Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer. Speaking on stage as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hbYl4_y7N14">part of an IGN Live interview</a>, Spencer said directly that "I think we should have a handheld, too."</p>
<p>The comment stops just short of an official announcement that Microsoft is actively working on portable gaming hardware for the first time. But if anyone is in a position to make an "I think we should..." into an operational reality, it's Spencer.</p>
<p>"The future for us in hardware is pretty awesome," Spencer continued during the IGN presentation. "And the work that the team is doing around different form factors, different ways to play, I'm incredibly excited about it."</p>
<p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/9/7/23862655/microsoft-xbox-handheld-editorial-steam-deck">Previous insider reports</a> suggested that Microsoft had at one point prototyped a cloud-focused Xbox handheld sporting a new "lightweight version" of the Xbox UI. Speaking to IGN, though, Spencer suggested any potential portable Xbox would not be a modified version of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/08/sonys-200-handheld-portal-can-stream-games-from-your-ps5-and-uh-thats-it/">the streaming-only PlayStation Portal</a>.
</p><p>"I like my ROG Ally, my Lenovo Legion Go, my Steam Deck," Spencer said. "I think being able to play games locally is really important."</p>
<h2>We’ve heard it before?</h2>
<p>If Spencer's mention of "different form factors" sounds familiar, that's probably because he said something almost identical <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/02/microsoft-sure-seems-to-be-thinking-about-some-sort-of-portable-xbox/">back in February</a> when he told Bloomberg that he "get[s] excited about different form factors that allow people to play in different places." Around the same time, Spencer told the Verge that he was looking at unorthodox ways that Xbox could potentially capture more "player hours," saying:
</p><blockquote><p>So, OK, what keeps people from playing certain hours? Well there’s some sleep, school, and kind of normal life, but some of it is just access. Do I have access to the games that I want to play right now? Obviously we’re kind of learning from what Nintendo has done over the years with Switch, they’ve been fantastic with that. So when I look at Steam Deck and the ROG and my Legion Go, I’m a big fan of that space.</p></blockquote>

<p>Comments like these are a big change from <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/09/ftc-v-microsoft-document-leak-outs-detailed-plans-for-mid-gen-xbox-refresh/">internal Microsoft documents that leaked last September</a>, which listed an Xbox portable as a "current gap in FY23" that is "not in scope for 1st party" (alongside potential products like a mobile controller, earbuds, and a media remote). But Spencer was <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/09/xbox-exec-says-leaked-old-emails-and-documents-have-outdated-info/">quick to call that leak "outdated"</a> at the time, so it might not be the last word on Microsoft's portable gaming plans.</p>                                            
                                                        
<p>In 2020, former Chief Xbox Officer Robbie Bach <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/microsoft-never-made-handhelds-reason/">said</a> that his tenure—which ended in 2010—included "at least three groups that presented portable Xbox presentations... All three times, we decided not to do it." That feels like ancient history, though, in a world where <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/04/i-for-one-welcome-our-new-steam-deck-killing-windows-running-overlords/">everyone</a> and their <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/06/new-steam-deck-competitor-lets-you-easily-swap-in-more-ram-storage/">corporate subsidiary</a> is <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/04/no-one-needs-this-cryptocurrency-powered-steam-deck-competitor/">looking</a> to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/01/why-more-pc-gaming-handhelds-should-ditch-windows-for-steamos/">draft</a> off <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/11/review-steam-deck-oleds-brilliant-screen-fixes-the-portables-biggest-flaw/">the market success of the Steam Deck</a>. And if Spencer gets his heart's deepest wish, it seems like Microsoft might be joining them before too long.</p>

                <p>Full Circle, the team behind the highly anticipated Skate reboot, has shared some new information about what players can expect upon its release. This includes a new way to use the iconic Flick-it system, a new approach to soundtracks, and lots of customization options.</p><p dir="ltr">Senior gameplay designer Reid Buckmaster explained in a development update that the studio has "done a ton of work rebuilding Flick-it to ensure that every trick feels as satisfying to perform as ever." Buckmaster explained that the new system will accurately help players perform more-difficult tricks and is meant to be fun and satisfying for everyone.</p>

<p dir="ltr">As the video continued, gameplay software engineer Lance Lawson stated the team has been pushing the limits of the Frostbite engine and has been able to add various new tricks. These include Slappies, Boned Ollies, Quick-Pop Ollies, Wallies, Improved Power Slides, Enhanced Transitions, Pre-Wind Spins, Roll-Ins, Grind Bump-Outs, and Smoother Flip Tricks.</p><p dir="ltr">Players can fully take advantage of San Vansterdam (in-game location) by placing objects where they want via Quick Drops. As they progress through the game, they can unlock various items, including customizations for their character, board, and even new objects to place around the world.</p><p dir="ltr">Another interesting feature that was mentioned during the development update is that the game will be ever-changing. New parts of the city will be added from season to season, and the music will update based on which songs players are listening to the most. Near the end of the video, it was revealed that console players will be able to get their hands on Skate a bit early by signing up to be playtesters this fall.</p><p dir="ltr">For more Skate content, check out <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/skate-everything-we-know-about-the-skate-reboot/1100-6505591/">our story detailing everything we know so far</a>.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Metal Slug Tactics - Official Gameplay Features Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">Each playable character can move and shoot in the same turn, and staying on the move grants an important damage reduction modifier that will be essential to staying alive. Each character sports a basic weapon with unlimited ammo, as well as a more-powerful secondary weapon that has limited shots. Ammo for secondary weapons can be replenished by completing specific objectives. Attacking an enemy while another friendly squad member is within striking distance will activate a Sync attack, described as one of the key ways players will be able to dominate the battlefield and maximize the amount of damage they can do each turn.</p><p dir="ltr">By running, gunning, and completing Sync actions, squad members will build up Adrenaline, which can be used to activate powerful special abilities unique to each character. Of course, it wouldn't be a Metal Slug game without the titular armored vehicle, and players will be able to pilot various vehicles, including the Metal Slug, over the course of the game. The Slug uses fuel as a resource, but can attack multiple times as long as it has the required fuel. Fallen squad members can be revived with a 1up token, but players only have a limited number of reinforcements over the course of each set of missions, with more able to be acquired by completing various objectives.</p><p dir="ltr">Metal Slug Tactics, developed by Leikir Studio and published by Dotemu, is slated to release in Fall 2024 on Steam for PC, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, and Nintendo Switch.</p>

<p data-characters="223" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Thanks to her ability to deal high Liberation damage, offer a 38% Resonance Skill DMG Deepen buff, and her title as the game’s only shielder, Taoqi can be a great addition to a wide array of teams in <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/tag/wuthering-waves/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wuthering Waves</a></em>. </p> <p data-characters="259" data-current-count="259" data-injectable="false">But who can benefit the most from her buff? And more importantly, which weapon and Sonata should you pick to potentialize her strengths? For all looking to awaken her true potential as a defensive support, here’s the best Taoqi build in <em>Wuthering Waves</em>.</p> <h2 id="h-the-best-weapons-for-taoqi-in-wuthering-waves" data-injectable="false">The best weapons for Taoqi in Wuthering Waves</h2> <figure data-wp-context="{ &quot;core&quot;: 				{ &quot;image&quot;: 					{   &quot;imageLoaded&quot;: false, 						&quot;initialized&quot;: false, 						&quot;lightboxEnabled&quot;: false, 						&quot;hideAnimationEnabled&quot;: false, 						&quot;preloadInitialized&quot;: false, 						&quot;lightboxAnimation&quot;: &quot;zoom&quot;, 						&quot;imageUploadedSrc&quot;: &quot;https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/the-best-weapons-for-taoqi-in-wuthering-waves.jpg&quot;, 						&quot;imageCurrentSrc&quot;: &quot;&quot;, 						&quot;targetWidth&quot;: &quot;1200&quot;, 						&quot;targetHeight&quot;: &quot;675&quot;, 						&quot;scaleAttr&quot;: &quot;&quot;, 						&quot;dialogLabel&quot;: &quot;Enlarged image&quot; 					} 				} 			}" data-wp-interactive="" data-current-count="559" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image by Destructoid</figcaption> <div data-wp-body="" data-wp-bind--role="selectors.core.image.roleAttribute" data-wp-bind--aria-label="selectors.core.image.dialogLabel" data-wp-class--initialized="context.core.image.initialized" data-wp-class--active="context.core.image.lightboxEnabled" data-wp-class--hideanimationenabled="context.core.image.hideAnimationEnabled" data-wp-bind--aria-modal="selectors.core.image.ariaModal" data-wp-effect="effects.core.image.initLightbox" data-wp-on--keydown="actions.core.image.handleKeydown" data-wp-on--touchstart="actions.core.image.handleTouchStart" data-wp-on--touchmove="actions.core.image.handleTouchMove" data-wp-on--touchend="actions.core.image.handleTouchEnd" data-wp-on--click="actions.core.image.hideLightbox" tabindex="-1"> <p> <figure><figcaption>Image by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> </p> <p> <figure><figcaption>Image by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> </p>  </div></figure>
 <p data-characters="407" data-current-count="407" data-injectable="true">As Taoqi’s whole kit scales off Defense, the best weapon for her is the 4-star <strong>Dauntless Evernight</strong>. The weapon earns the spot given its 61.56% DEF substat (at level 90). When using the broadblade, you will also be able to get another 15% boost in the stat by performing her Intro Skill (R1). Using the 4-star Discord can also work, as its Energy Regen value will increase her Liberation availability. </p>
 <p data-characters="450" data-current-count="450" data-injectable="true">Dauntless Evernight is also my main F2P pick for Taoqi, as you can find a free copy of it within the Port City of Guixu. The free copy of the weapon will only become available after you complete the We Promise, We Deliver quest. You can check out its exact location in our <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/how-to-get-all-free-5-and-4-star-weapons-in-wuthering-waves/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">How to get all free 5 and 4-star weapons in <em>Wuthering Waves</em> guide.</a> For F2P players looking to get an extra boost in ER, the craftable 4-star Broadblade#41 will be my main pick. </p>
 <h2 id="h-best-sonata-and-echoes-for-taoqi" data-injectable="false">Best Sonata and Echoes for Taoqi</h2> <p data-characters="340" data-current-count="340" data-injectable="false">The best Sonata for Taoqi is a full <strong>Moonlit Clouds</strong> set. The set shines through its ability to provide a handy amount of ER and further empower her Outro Skill by adding a 22.5% ATK buff to it. As Taoqi’s ability to constantly self-heal will allow you to always proc its buff, a full Rejuvenating Glow set will be my main alternative. </p> <p data-characters="347" data-current-count="687" data-injectable="true">When using Moonlit Clouds, the best main echo for Taoqi is Impermanence Heron. The echo is a must, as it will allow you to offer a 12% all-damage boost to the character taking the field after her. I recommend that you pair our main pick with two Elites and two Common echoes. If using Rejuvenating Glow, go with Bell-Borne Geochelone as your main.</p>
 <h3 id="h-best-stats-and-substats" data-injectable="false">Best stats and substats</h3> <p data-characters="238" data-current-count="238" data-injectable="false">As the focus of our build lies in both strengthening her shield and allowing her to deal good damage, I recommend going with Crit Rate as the main stat for your main echo.

After last night's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragon-age-the-veilguard-first-look-reveals-companions-and-fan-favourite-returning-character">cinematic trailer for Dragon Age: The Veilguard which detailed the game's full suite of seven companion characters</a>, today brings our first - albeit very brief - glimpse at actual gameplay.
</p>
<p>
A short clip shared to social media platform X shows series regular Varric in Minrathous, capital of the Tevinter  Imperium region, a location we have heard plenty about - but never seen before in a mainline Dragon Age game.

<p>
Varric is hot on the tail of Solas following the events of Dragon Age: Inquisition, though I imagine things won't be as easy as he makes out here. Minrathous, meanwhile, or the quick glimpse we get of it, looks suitably grim. I'm getting dark Ankh Morpork vibes.

<p>The footage, and an accompanying press release, confirms The Veilguard's player character will be named Rook. </p>
<p>"Dragon Age: The Veilguard features some of the deepest companion storylines in Dragon Age history, navigating romance, tragic loss and complex choices that will affect relationships with players and the fate of The Veilguard," said creative director John Epler. 
</p>
<p>"BioWare's storytelling roots shine through every chapter of this adventure, and we are incredibly excited for Dragon Age fans as well as those new to the series to experience this crafted, character-driven narrative that is so intertwined with our studio's DNA."</p>
<p>
We'll see much more of Dragon Age: The Veilguard tomorrow in BioWare's big gameplay reveal livestream. That's set for 4pm UK time - and you'll be able to watch it right here on Eurogamer.

              <section>

                  
          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p dir="ltr">I hate small talk. I don't feel I'm any good at it. I don't want to engage in it. I practically run from it if I see it coming. But I love talking about big ideas, especially philosophy. Quite obviously, that makes me annoying. I admit it. People minding their own business in a casual setting may feel assaulted by my unprovoked diatribes about Nagel's concept of moral luck, humankind's supposed dominion over other animals, or the virtues of a restorative justice system. Thankfully, with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/pro-philosopher-2-governments-and-grievances/" data-ref-id="5000-591162">Pro Philosopher 2: Governments and Grievances</a>, everyone in my personal life can enjoy a reprieve from my ceaseless desire to debate and discuss topics like these as I work to beat this game instead.</p><p dir="ltr">Pro Philosopher 2 (PP2) is modeled closely after the Ace Attorney series but recontextualizes Capcom's art style and mechanics to focus on philosophical debates rather than pit players in a court drama. Here you don't present evidence that refutes the claims being spoken from the witness stand; you find holes in the arguments of your verbal sparring partner.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tFBrzfQsnmQ" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/tFBrzfQsnmQ" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">The first game, which focused on moral philosophy specifically, is on Steam for free following a debut on Kongregate years ago that earned it some cult praise. I came to the series with the upcoming second game, which very pointedly focuses on political philosophy this time around. Because if there's one thing gamers love, it's politics in their games.</p><p dir="ltr">Jokes aside, Pro Philosopher 2 is made for people like me who sincerely <em>do</em> feel that way--and it's also self-aware enough to take digs at itself in the demo I played. The game supposes a metaphysical realm in which you have access to numerous philosophers from world history and you can attempt to unravel their worldviews. In the demo, which is available for a limited time as part of Steam Next Fest starting today, you'll get to take on Machiavelli, author of The Prince, whose might-makes-right philosophy still lingers in our real world all too often today.</p><p dir="ltr">It serves as a strong introduction to the game, because not only will you get to learn the ropes of the game's debate mechanics--in which you ask clarifying and backing questions before challenging your opponent's perspective armed with their own words--but it also quickly becomes obvious how relevant these centuries-old points of view still often are--for better or worse. For those interested in the subject matter but perhaps not as well-versed in it, the game even feels like a strong introduction to the material.</p><p dir="ltr">In my demo level, I had to carefully dissect Machiavelli's words to try and prove why it actually <em>isn't </em>better for a leader to be feared than loved. There were often many wrong answers and few right ones, and each wrong answer would damage my credibility rating like a health bar, which I find to be an awesomely creative way to transpose a debate into a video game.</p><p dir="ltr">The game pairs its Ace Attorney-like 2D cartoonish art with a serious understanding of the subject matter, but even then it doesn't take itself too seriously. When I initially failed to beat Machiavelli in the demo, the characters discussed how it might not be a strong first impression with which to sway me into buying the game, all in a very fourth-wall-breaking manner. And during the course of any debate, you're armed with a secret, albeit ineffective, weapon: You can simply tell your rival they stink. Literally. You can use the "you stink!" reply to resort to the debate tactics of a fourth-grader, and honestly, that's still seen pretty often in modern politics, so I think it's fitting.</p><p dir="ltr">Enjoying the demo for PP2 as much as I did, I'm now looking forward to the full game when it launches later this year, and in the meantime, I'm perhaps even more excited to go back to the first one and argue moral philosophy--which is really where I do my best annoy-everyone-around-me work. You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2120070/Pro_Philosopher_2_Governments__Grievances/" rel="nofollow ">try the demo for yourself for a limited time on Steam</a>, or <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2120060/Socrates_Jones_Pro_Philosopher/" rel="nofollow ">download the original</a>, which is free.</p>

Knowing that that story arc was wrapping up has left the future of the game a little hazy, but we now have a clearer idea of what the next year will look like for Destiny 2, as well as a tease of where things are headed in 2025.</p><p dir="ltr">Bungie laid out the details of the rest of the year's Destiny 2 content, divided into three big story arcs called Episodes, in a short new vidoc called The Journey Ahead. Mostly, it fills in some story and gameplay details about what each of those episodes will entail, because up until now, we only knew their names and the structure of how Bungie was arranging content going forward.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Destiny 2 | The Journey Ahead</p>
      </div>
<h2 dir="ltr">Episode 1: Echoes</h2><p dir="ltr">The first episode, Echoes, starts Tuesday, June 11, and deals directly with the aftermath of The Final Shape's conclusion. The Witness, Destiny 2's ultimate antagonist up until now, is defeated, but the paracausal energy it embodied isn't gone. Instead, it mixed with the Light of the Traveler to manifest weird artifacts from the Witness's memory, shooting them out into the solar system. The episodes all deal with the fallout of what those sources of power to do the worlds where they land and the people who find them, with the first one resulting in major shifts to Nessus.</p><p dir="ltr">Bungie said that players will head to Nessus to find the echo and discover the location has been physically altered, with the Vex enemies there acting strangely. The episode comes with a new activity, Breach Executable, which Bungie described as an "arena-style offensive" in which you're trying to cap geysers of Radiolaria (otherwise known as "Vex milk") while holding off hordes of enemies.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4316525-destiny2year10%287%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4316525" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4316525-destiny2year10%287%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4316525"></a><figcaption>Strange things are afoot inside Nessus.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4316525-destiny2year10%287%29.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">The episode is also going to take players deeper into Nessus to uncover secrets of what used to be there--including, apparently, a whole lost civilization. It looks like that will include more than just a few superficial changes to Nessus as it tells its story. Bungie also teased a new villain who might be behind what's happening with the Vex and said the Vex will exhibit new behavior, changing up how they act in battle.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Episode 2: Revenant</h2><p dir="ltr">The second episode is Revenant, one that deals with Scorn leader Fikrul, otherwise known as the Fanatic. Bungie described the Episode as having a sort of "vampire-hunter" theme, and it'll heavily concern the Fallen, who are finally trying to establish a new permanent home since their own homeworld, Riis, was destroyed by the Witness. Bungie said you'll team up with the Fallen to become a Slayer Baron, essentially a Fallen monster hunter.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4316528-destiny2year10%2810%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4316528" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4316528-destiny2year10%2810%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4316528"></a><figcaption>Concept art for Revenant suggests armor inspired by the Scorn and the act of killing monsters.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4316528-destiny2year10%2810%29.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">In practice, the vampire-hunter theme is informing the armor aesthetic--you look a lot like you're in Bloodborne or the movie Van Helsing. Fikrul also has a Dracula castle, so it sounds like we'll be Castlevania-ing our way through that. As for new gameplay, Bungie mentioned a potion-crafting system, where you'll be able to create potions that provide different combat buffs and influence what loot drops you receive.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Episode 3: Heresy</h2><p dir="ltr">The final episode, Heresy, concerns the Hive. The Final Shape saw Savathun standing as both an ally and an antagonist to the Guardians, and her sister, Xivu Arath, is still out in the universe somewhere as a potential threat. Bungie said the episode is going to shake up the existing relationships in the Hive god pantheon, which sounds ominous and potentially important for Destiny 2's future.</p><p dir="ltr">As for the relevant details of what's taking place: We're headed back to the Dreadnaught, the big Hive battleship that was introduced in Destiny's The Taken King expansion and has been kind of chilling in the orbit of Saturn ever since. It'll have an activity Bungie likened to The Coil from the Season of the Wish, although we don't have many details about how it'll actually work. Bungie referred to an "eldritch force" players will face aboard the Dreadnaught and showed off two armor sets--one that takes cues from resident Hive expert and former Hive god Eris Morn, and another that imagines being a navigator on the Dreadnaught. That last one has the flair of an 18th century officer's uniform from a European navy, but made out of bones.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Destiny 2 Year 11</h2><p dir="ltr">The last thing Bungie did was tease Destiny 2 content in 2025, although it provided precisely zero details about what that might entail. The final screen of the vidoc just listed the name "Codename: Frontiers" with the Destiny 2 logo.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4316523-destiny2year10%281%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4316523" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4316523-destiny2year10%281%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4316523"></a><figcaption>Here is what we know about Year 11: this image.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4316523-destiny2year10%281%29.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">There are a couple things to intuit from that slide, at least. First, the use of the Destiny 2 logo might suggest that we're not in for a Destiny 3 anytime soon, despite some rumors to the contrary. To some degree, that make sense--with massive player investment in Destiny 2, rebooting the community in a whole new game has its risks, even if that might help Bungie deal with some of the current game's technical limitations.</p><p dir="ltr">As for the name, Codename: Frontiers might suggest expanding Destiny 2 beyond the solar system, where the game has taken place up until now. Before the original Collapse that kicked off the story and created the world we've been playing in, humanity was trying to expand beyond Sol and out into the rest of the universe, and it would make some sense for the story to go back to that direction, cleaning a lot of the slate for something new. But that's all speculative at this point.</p><p dir="ltr">In the meantime, we at least have a better understanding of where things are going from The Final Shape for the next year. Bungie didn't mention any new dungeons or raids among the episodes, but the Annual Pass that was made available with The Final Shape buys access to a dungeon, so we can expect at least one to pop up sooner or later, too.</p>
