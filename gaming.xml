            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/31/24284644/apex-legends-loses-linux-steam-deck-support-anti-cheat<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Apex Legends</em> is one of the only battle royale games that lets you play on a Steam Deck gaming handheld — <em>Fortnite, Valorant </em>and<em> PUBG</em> and more never supported it in the first place, citing concerns about anti-cheat. But today, Electronic Arts and Respawn are taking the game away for that very same reason. </p><p>“In our efforts to combat cheating in Apex, we’ve identified Linux OS as being a path for a variety of impactful exploits and cheats. As a result, we’ve decided to block Linux OS access to the game,” writes EA, <a href="https://answers.ea.com/t5/News-Game-Updates/Dev-Team-Update-Linux-amp-Anti-Cheat/td-p/14217740">in a blog post explaining the decision</a>.</p><p><em>Apex Legends did</em> have anti-cheat software that <em>did</em> run on the Steam Deck — specifically, the game uses Epic Games’ Easy Anti-Cheat (EAC), which has been compatible with the Linux gaming handheld <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/23/22690670/epic-eac-anti-cheat-linux-valve-steam-deck-support-games">for over three years now</a>. But that wasn’t good enough for Epic Games’ own <em>Fortnite — </em>Tim Sweeney explained that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/2/8/22923163/fortnite-steam-deck-update-epic-tim-sweeney">the “threat model” was too large in 2022</a> — and it’s apparently no longer good enough for EA now.</p><p>“Linux cheats are indeed harder to detect and the data shows that they are growing at a rate that requires an outsized level of focus and attention from the team for a relatively small platform. There are also cases in which cheats for the Windows OS get emulated as if it’s on Linux in order to increase the difficulty of detection and prevention,” EA writes today.</p><p>Riot Games has similar concerns. Like many game developers, it also doesn’t support <em>Valorant </em>and <em>League of Legends</em> on Linux due to the increased possibility of cheating. In a recent interview with <em>The Verge</em>, Phillip Koskinas, director of anti-cheat on <em>Valorant</em>, discussed why game developers are shying away from Linux support. </p><p>“You can freely manipulate the kernel, and there’s no user mode calls to attest that it’s even genuine,” says Koskinas. “You could make a Linux distribution that’s purpose-built for cheating and we’d be smoked.”</p><p>Linux is so open that you can run an emulated version of <em>Counter-Strike 2</em> right now on a Steam Deck and still have a cheat on the device. “Imagine if Steam Deck just has the security handled so we know it’s a genuine device, it’s fully attested, all these features are enabled, we’d be like cool, go game, no problem” says Koskinas.</p><p>As usual, it’s not clear if this is mostly a Linux problem, or mostly a problem of needing to spend more money on creative solutions than the small number of players might be worth. Last December, Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeney told us he <em>could</em> possibly justify putting <em>Fortnite</em> on the Steam Deck <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/12/12/23999300/fortnite-on-steam-deck-sweeney-says-valve-needs-tens-of-millions-of-users-to-justify-it">if it had “tens of millions of users” there</a>, and EA writes today that it weighed its <em>Apex </em>decision based on the “small” population of Linux players versus how “their impact infected a fair amount of players’ games.”</p><p>EA says you’ll still be able to play <em>Apex Legends</em> on a Steam Deck if you install Windows. Valve still hasn’t released its own dual-boot installer to make putting Windows on a Steam Deck easier — the feature has been <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/11/9/23954455/the-ability-to-dual-boot-windows-is-still-high-on-the-list-of-steam-deck-priorities">“high on the list” for some time</a> — but it has recently <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/13/24219469/valve-steamos-asus-rog-ally-steady-progress-dual-boot#:~:text=Yang%20on%20that%3A-,As%20for%20Windows,-%2C%20we%E2%80%99re%20preparing%20to">plugged some of the big holes</a> in its Windows drivers.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Part of the fun of Dragon Age's fantasy is that it's inconsistent - or at least, inconsistent by the standards of fantasy <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPGs</a>, which often break down into a million neatly organised and interlocking codex entries. It all rides on who you speak to. The humans believe one thing about the origins and workings of Thedas, the elves another, the qunari something else entirely. These differences are the basis for many factional disagreements and thus, many core series plot developments. According to former lead writer David Gaider, however, there's an "uber-plot" behind it all that may one day be resolved and bring the series to a close, assuming BioWare continue to refer to his original (and closely guarded) narrative documents.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
Gaider recently spoke to <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/">Eurogamer</a>'s Robert Purchese, aka The Lovely Bertie, about how he and BioWare came up with the setting. The result is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bioware-knew-the-deepest-secrets-of-dragon-age-lore-20-years-ago-and-locked-it-away-in-an-uber-plot-doc">a jolly article on world-building</a>, from which I have dutifully plucked out some intriguing snippets.</p>
<p>Amongst other things, Gaider asserts the importance of doubt and free interpretation when unearthing the history of Thedas. "To get the truth, you kind of have to pick between the lines," he says in the piece. This is especially true of the oldest tales about the setting's origins and in particular, the Fade, an engulfing dimension that is the source of magic. "In general, the further the history goes back, we always would purposefully obfuscate it more and more, make it more biased and more untrue no matter who was talking, just so that the absolute truth was rarely knowable," Gaider goes on. "I like that idea from a world standpoint, that the player always has to wonder and bring their own beliefs to it."
</p>
<p>
As Bertie points out, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dragon-age-dreadwolf">Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a> could be a big step towards resolving Gaider's original "uber-plot". Without giving away too much, one story theme is the return of a bunch of ancient Elven gods who can remember the early days of Thedas. I have yet to play The Veilguard myself - <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dragon-age-the-veilguard-review">Nic's review is here</a> - but in theory, those fey antiques are in a position to clear up any disagreement about, say, the precise nature of the ethereal Black City that supposedly once harboured the world's creator. 
</p><p>
"Yeah, we have access to people who can tell us the truth from first-hand experience," Gaider comments, "although again, it depends on what the writers did with it." He's interested to discover whether Bioware have continued the "tradition" of leaving players in doubt about the fundamentals. Interested and perhaps a bit alarmed. 
</p>
<p>
"I mean, will they one day definitively tell you about the Maker? Will we crack the big mysteries of the world and just make them answered finally? And does that ruin one of the central precepts that Dragon Age is founded upon? Maybe. Ultimately, that lore, when you make it big and you hint at it and hint at it and hint at it, it becomes a Chekhov's Gun of sorts. Eventually you got to pony up."
</p>
<p>
I like fantasy worlds that offer me a spectrum of competing lies, with truth inevitably found in the eye of the Beholder. While I'm not above the lure of a fully filled-out codex, I've always felt it's a shame that so many RPGs default to treating the setting like an unlockable encyclopedia, where clarity and certainty are simply a question of putting the hours in. Mind you, I also think it's a shame that so many RPGs keep you guessing about certain world and narrative threads, in order to leave room for sequels or expansions. Much like Dragon Age, I am an inconsistent being. Anyway, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dragon-age-the-veilguard-releases-today-and-players-are-celebrating-the-famous-bioware-turn">Dragon Age: The Veilguard is out today, and apparently people are going nuts about turns</a>.

		<p><em>Remember when you’d walk into a local music, book, or video store and there’d be an adorable section where the employees would recommend what they were interested in that month?</em></p><p><em>Welcome to our little version of it, called Remap Recommends.&nbsp;</em></p><p><em>The staff and contributors that make up Remap play all sorts of video games, and you hear us talk about most of them on weekly episodes of Remap Radio. But even with nearly three hours of banter, some games don’t make the cut, or simply do not fit into the flow of conversation. We also don’t do a lot of “reviews” here at Remap, so we needed to find something that fit in-between.</em></p><p><em>Every month, Remap Recommends is a chance for each of us to sit back and reflect on a game that’s continued to sit with us, to the point that we want to tell you, in writing, why it’s interesting.</em></p><p><em>These aren’t traditional reviews. They’re not long essays. This is “Hey, check this out. I liked it.”</em></p><hr><h3 id="patrick-recommends%E2%80%A6unsorted-horror">Patrick Recommends…<em>Unsorted Horror</em></h3><figure></figure><p><strong>Platform: </strong>PC (<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2433730/Unsorted_Horror/?ref=remapradio.com"><u>Steam</u></a>, <a href="http://itch.io/?ref=remapradio.com"><u>itch.io</u></a>)<br><strong>Genre: </strong>Short Form Horror<br><strong>Hours Played:</strong> Two<br><strong>Number of Jump Scares: </strong>Three<br><strong>Spiders?: </strong>No comment</p><p>I have an affinity for short form horror specifically because it squeezes out what crushes most scary stories in longer formats: characters. A clever idea, or creepy design for a monster, has trouble holding up over the course of two hours without decent characters to string you along. Characters can elevate gimmicks to something special. But sometimes, one good idea, or good twist, can be enough! </p><p>In <em>Unsorted Horror</em>, an anthology series of interactive horror shorts, you are not experiencing hours of tension and release. You’re spending 15 or 20 minutes in one of five vignettes determined to make you squirm. It doesn’t have to justify a skill arc for the character, or a series of interactions that need to feel good seven hours from now. It turns the screws quickly, before hitting you with a singular relief: the credits. </p><p>Finally released, you can move onto the next set of nightmares.</p><p>P.S. If you're looking for good horror short story anthologies, my favorites include Clive Barker's <em>Book(s) of Blood</em> and Stephen King's <em>Skeleton Crew</em>. The latter includes King's horrifying <em>The Jaunt</em>.</p><hr><h3 id="rob-recommends%E2%80%A6-football-tactics-glory">Rob Recommends… <em>Football, Tactics &amp; Glory</em></h3><figure></figure><p><strong>Platform:</strong> PC (<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/375530/Football_Tactics__Glory/?ref=remapradio.com" rel="noreferrer">Steam</a>)<br><strong>Genre:</strong> Turn-based tactics, sports<br><strong>Hours Played:</strong> 4<br><strong>Offsides Called:</strong> 12</p><p>A month or so ago, we had a long conversation on the podcast about how we wished there were more sports games that had space to go wild with the concept and embrace the weirdness that is often sanded-down in officially licensed games. That led to a brief interlude where we were delving deep in Steam to look at sports games from further afield than the likes of EA Sports and super crunchy management sims. One of the things that caught my eye was <em>Football, Tactics &amp; Glory</em>. The Steam page pithily describes it as “XCOM meets Football Manager” and that’s pretty much accurate and it’s as cool as it sounds.</p><p>The game slowly layers in complexity via a long tutorial, and one of the things that distinguishes it from <em>XCOM </em>is that your footballers move a bit more like chess pieces than squaddies do in <em>XCOM</em>. Certain players are able to do special movements and maneuvers just by virtue of what positions they have been assigned, so the same guy can do things as a wing that he can’t do as a defender, even if his stats are appropriate for both. On the other hand, every player learns special abilities that they <em>can </em>take with them no matter where on the pitch they are playing.</p><!--members-only--><p>It‘s a <em>lot </em>to keep track of, to be honest, and I think it’s harder for me because I don’t have an intuitive sense of soccer’s logic. <em>Football, Tactics &amp; Glory </em>relies a lot on that across its tutorial-packed opening hours. But it’s also an incredibly charming and rewarding game. Seasons change as you play, the stadiums you play in get fancier as you climb the ladder into serious professional play, and you watch your hopeless little rookies slowly develop competitive identities that turn them into superheroes on the pitch.</p><p>It’s also, frankly, a game that seems to resist becoming rote in the way that some tactics games do. Because so many plays require precise positioning, and the only way to get enough actions to complete your set-pieces is to use your players’ special abilities successfully, each turn feels a bit more like you are solving a chess-puzzle. Think more <em>Into the Breach </em>or <em>Tactical Breach Wizards</em> for how you have to plan your attack.</p><p>People who know soccer better could probably tell me how right or wrong I am on this score but <em>Football, Tactics &amp; Glory </em>feels like it is actually a pretty brilliant interpretation of soccer, and one whose rules and mechanics do a lot to teach the intricacy of the beautiful game.</p><hr><h3 id="cado-recommends-the-jackbox-survey-scramble">Cado Recommends... <em>The Jackbox Survey Scramble</em></h3><figure><figcaption><span>Image f</span></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Platform: </strong>PC (<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2948640/The_Jackbox_Survey_Scramble/?ref=remapradio.com"><u>Steam</u></a>), <a href="https://www.jackboxgames.com/games/the-jackbox-survey-scramble?ref=remapradio.com"><u>Basically Every Console</u></a><br><strong>Genre: </strong>Party Game<br><strong>Hours Played:</strong> Two<br><strong>Volume When Yelling at My Team During Bounce: </strong>+20 dB<br><strong>Schmitty?: </strong>No, thankfully</p><p>It’s honestly a bit of a surprise that Jackbox has taken this long to hop on the “Family Feud” style survey based games, about as surprising as the way this game seemed to stealth drop this month. It’s almost like Jackbox was trying to scrub everyone’s collective memory of that <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2652000/The_Jackbox_Naughty_Pack/?ref=remapradio.com"><u>unfortunate pack</u></a> they dropped last month that was rightfully lambasted for grossly misunderstanding why it’s fun to put obscenities into Quiplash. It’s not funny when the cum jokes make sense in context!</p><p>In Jackbox Survey Scramble, you and your friends are treated to four different survey based games, all with slightly different setups but seemingly pulling from the same pool of survey material. The sets range from opinion based questions like “What is something that you could crush in your hands” to the more subjective brand of “My Ex thinks I’m …” with one common thread: every answer can only be one word. The games themselves have you either trying to guess what’s at the very top or very bottom of the list for points (HiLo) to trying to fill in as much of the list as possible (speed), to breaking your group into teams for versions of Tic Tac Toe (Squares) and Breakout (Bounce) that have you using the range to try and place your team’s X/O/Paddle in just the right place.</p><p>I had a ton of fun with all of these games aside from speed, which requires a focus that has you head down and not interacting with the people around you, a failure as far as party games are concerned. The team games in particular are really great and had a ton of opportunities for chatter and teamwork with really hilarious arguments over whether something comes higher or lower on the list. Do you think babies or depression are higher on the list of “things that make you cry?” Like a lot of good Jackbox games, the correct answer doesn’t even matter, it’s all delicious fodder for jokes, arguments, and good times with friends.</p>

The only thing standing between the surviving trio and having their greatest desires granted is one last trial and the looming presence of Agatha’s newly revealed ex, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/agatha-all-along-death-aubrey-plaza-marvel-disney-1851681598https://kotaku.com/agatha-all-along-death-aubrey-plaza-marvel-disney-1851681598&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/agatha-all-along-death-aubrey-plaza-marvel-disney-1851681598https://kotaku.com/agatha-all-along-death-aubrey-plaza-marvel-disney-1851681598">Death</a></span> (Plaza). The first half of the two-part finale focuses on this trial, which asks the witches to make something grow in a concrete and metal enclosure bereft of life.</p><p>Despite having twice as long to tell the end of its tale, however, <em>Agatha All Along</em> rushes through the end of the Witches’ Road. This results in Jen, whose story about being mysteriously bound a century ago has been teased for several episodes, getting a quick bow tied to her whole arc and being sent away with little fanfare. It’s a deflating moment, as the show has implied that this is some big thing waiting to be revealed, but when the only revelation is that Agatha accidentally bound Jen in the past for some quick cash, it goes nowhere and the two resolve their differences in a couple of minutes. Jen has never been one of the strongest characters on the show, and concluding her arc with this haphazard ending a week after Patti LuPone delivered the show’s best performance in its <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/agatha-all-along-marvel-disney-episode-7-death-reveal-1851680675&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/agatha-all-along-marvel-disney-episode-7-death-reveal-1851680675">defining episode</a></span> is a major misstep.</p><p>Once Jen is out of the picture, <em>Agatha All Along</em> is free to refocus on its greatest aspect, the relationship between Agatha and Billy. With death seemingly imminent for the two as they can’t pass the trial, Agatha is able to help Billy connect with his powers and discover where his lost brother is, thus fulfilling the wish that led him to the Witches’ Road and sending him to safety, leaving Agatha alone to die. This moment also leads to the show’s most gut-wrenching revelation: Agatha’s son wasn’t sacrificed by her on the Witches’ Road at all, he just died. When Kathryn Hahn quietly tells Billy that sometimes boys just die, it’s a heartbreaking confession that there is no power in the world that can keep death away. </p><p>But as this is a Marvel property and we aren’t even through the first half of this finale yet, we can’t end on that emotional note. The climax of part one devolves into another special-effects-heavy brawl as Death and the team of Billy and Agatha fire different colored magical blasts at each other. Until now, <em>Agatha All Along</em> has largely steered clear of action, instead choosing to focus on interesting puzzles the coven has to face in each trial. Trading all that originality in for action that makes your eyes glaze over just made me wish the show would end as quickly as possible.</p><p>Thankfully, the show comes to an end quick enough. Agatha chooses to sacrifice herself in order to save Billy, which she does by sharing a passionate kiss with her longtime lover, Death, that immediately leads to Agatha keeling over and dropping dead. It’s nice that we actually got a kiss between Plaza and Hahn in the show as they’ve played their characters as explicitly queer, but it’s almost laughable that Agatha is killed off immediately after this display in what has to be one of the most eye-rolling cases of “kill your gays.” Oh, and we actually have a whole other episode to get through!</p><figure id="" data-id="e69e7ee9a46fdfc47bdf2efe3633055b" data-recommend-id="image://e69e7ee9a46fdfc47bdf2efe3633055b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Billy dressed in a blue crown and red cape" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Billy dressed in a blue crown and red cape" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Disney</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="e69e7ee9a46fdfc47bdf2efe3633055b" data-recommend-id="image://e69e7ee9a46fdfc47bdf2efe3633055b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Billy dressed in a blue crown and red cape" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>You might wonder what there is left to wrap up, the show’s titular character just died! But part one ends with the reveal that the Witches’ Road was conjured into existence by Billy’s powers unconsciously turning his dreams into reality. It’s a reveal that fans had <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/agatha-all-along-marvel-witches-road-wiccan-theory-1851677479&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/agatha-all-along-marvel-witches-road-wiccan-theory-1851677479">already clocked</a></span>, but one that still feels like a cheap trick that does nothing but take away meaning from what has largely been an excellent show.</p><p>Yet before we even get to that, the last episode of <em>Agatha All Along</em> begins with a lengthy flashback that reveals the story of Agatha’s son, Nicholas. It turns out that the boy was fated to die in childbirth, until Agatha pleaded with her lover to spare his life. All deals have a price, of course, and Death warned Agatha that his time would still be limited. Naturally Agatha and Nicholas live a fairly happy life for a few years, until one night Nicholas dies in his sleep. What’s supposed to be a window into Agatha’s soul at her most vulnerable, however, feels instead like padding to a finale that has already overstayed its welcome. Marvel projects, on both the big and small screens, seem to think subtlety is the enemy. This is just another example of that mentality, as the single quiet moment between Billy and Agatha in the first part of the finale contains exponentially more meaning and power than this extended sequence. Instead of “show, don’t tell,” Marvel chooses to show and show and keep showing until they’ve beaten you over the head with the awareness that this should be sad. A parent outliving their child is inherently tragic, of course, but stretching this emotion to its limit has diminishing returns.</p><p>As its final and grandest reveal, <em>Agatha All Along</em> reframes everything we’ve seen before in a much poorer light. Rather than really being a show about Agatha, this is first and foremost Billy’s show. The deaths of every other coven member (minus Jen, who survives) are just footnotes in his origin story. To justify the show’s choices, Agatha appears to Billy to act as his debate partner one more time, now in the form of a ghost—perhaps the most egregious example yet of Marvel so clearly being unwilling to commit to killing off a fan-favorite character despite the death it wrote them into. Like the show has stated before, this whole journey just shows that Billy is a killer just like his mother, one who is unable to control his dark powers. Just like the dead coven members who are nothing more than fodder for Wiccan character growth, the entirety of <em>Agatha All Along</em> feels like one more Marvel project that isn’t meant to stand on its own but is instead fodder for the grand MCU machine. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>In a fitting reveal for Halloween, NetherRealm Studios has revealed the first look at gameplay for Ghostface in Mortal Kombat 1. The gameplay was revealed by franchise co-creator Ed Boon on <a href="https://x.com/noobde/status/1851993028170219571" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">social media</a>.</p>



<p>Ghostface, for those who don’t know, is the main antagonist from the popular Scream series. What makes them so unique is that it’s never the same person under the mask in the movies. In total, there have been 14 people behind the mask.</p>



<p>In the clip, which you can see below, Ghostface fights Johnny Cage. They have their distinct voice-changer that keeps their identity hidden while also equipped with a knife.</p>



<p>Ghostface will be available in Mortal Kombat 1 starting November 19 for those with Early Access. Everyone else can start slashing away on November 26.</p>



<figure><video controls="" src="https://insider-gaming.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/Eeum7kp35B-QY9tv.mp4"></video></figure>



<p>Ghostface is just the latest fighter to be added to Mortal Kombat since the game’s release in September 2023. He is the 10th overall addition, and a part of the game’s Kombat Pack 2. Future additions to the Mortal Kombat 1 roster will include Conan the Barbarian and T-1000 from Terminator 2.</p>



<p>NetherRealm will announce those releases at a later date. Whether there will be a Kombat Pack 3 also remains to be announced.</p>



<p>What do you think of Ghostface coming to Mortal Kombat 1? Let us know down below, and take the discussion further in the official <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums</a>. </p>

<p>If you’re looking for the best SWAT 5.56 loadout in Call of Duty <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/black-ops-6-guides/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Ops 6</a>, we have recommended the ideal attachments, Perks, and Equipment to deal the maximum damage.</p>



<ul>
<li><a href="#h-best-swat-5-56-loadout-attachments-in-black-ops-6">Best attachments</a></li>



<li><a href="#h-best-perks-wildcard-amp-equipment-for-swat-5-56">Best Perks, Wildcard &amp; Equipment</a></li>



<li><a href="#h-best-secondary-for-swat-5-56">Best Secondary for SWAT 5.56</a></li>



<li><a href="#h-how-to-unlock-swat-5-56-in-black-ops-6">How to unlock SWAT 5.56</a></li>



<li><a href="#h-is-the-swat-5-56-any-good-in-black-ops-6">Is the SWAT 5.56 any good in Black Ops 6?</a></li>



<li><a href="#h-best-alternatives-to-the-swat-5-56-in-black-ops-6">Best alternatives</a></li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-best-swat-5-56-loadout-attachments-in-black-ops-6">Best SWAT 5.56 loadout attachments in Black Ops 6</h2>



<figure></figure>



<ul>
<li><strong>Muzzle</strong>: Suppressor</li>



<li><strong>Barrel</strong>: Long Barrel</li>



<li><strong>Underbarrel</strong>: Vertical Foregrip</li>



<li><strong>Rear Grip</strong>: Quickdraw Grip</li>



<li><strong>Fire Mods</strong>: Rapid Fire</li>
</ul>



<p>Attach the <strong>Suppressor</strong> for reduced gunfire sounds and to hide yourself from the minimap. The <strong>Vertical Foregrip</strong> will drastically reduce horizontal recoil, so that will come in handy while using this DMR.</p>



<p>The <strong>Long Barrel</strong> will increase the damage range while the <strong>Quickdraw Grip</strong> will improve the aiming speed of the weapon. Lastly, the <strong>Rapid Fire</strong> mod will increase the fire rate of the weapon but comes at a cost of reduced damage range, horizontal and vertical recoil control, and bullet velocity.</p>







<h2 id="h-best-perks-wildcard-amp-equipment-for-swat-5-56">Best Perks, Wildcard &amp; Equipment for SWAT 5.56</h2>



<ul>
<li><strong>Perk 1</strong>: Gung-Ho</li>



<li><strong>Perk 2</strong>: Assassin</li>



<li><strong>Perk 3</strong>: Double Time</li>



<li><strong>Perk 4</strong>: Dexterity</li>



<li><strong>Wildcard</strong>: Perk Greed</li>



<li><strong>Lethal</strong>: Semtex</li>



<li><strong>Tactical</strong>: Stim Shot</li>



<li><strong>Field Upgrade</strong>: Spring Mine</li>
</ul>



<p>The <strong>Enforcer</strong> is the best Specialty for the SWAT 5.56 and to get that, use Gung-Ho, Assassin, and Double Time in the respective Perk slots. This will give you a temporary buff to your movement speeds and health regeneration rate.</p>



<p>You can equip the <strong>Perk Greed </strong>Wildcard and keep <strong>Dexterity</strong> in the fourth Perk slot for reduced weapon motion while jumping, sliding, or diving.</p>



<figure></figure>



<h2 id="h-best-secondary-for-swat-5-56">Best Secondary for SWAT 5.56</h2>



<p>The ideal secondary weapon option for the SWAT 5.56 is <strong>Grekhova</strong> as this fully automatic pistol will add more firepower to your loadout.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-unlock-swat-5-56-in-black-ops-6">How to unlock SWAT 5.56 in Black Ops 6</h2>



<p>The SWAT 5.56 is unlocked immediately and you can start creating custom loadouts after reaching <strong>player level 4</strong>.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-the-swat-5-56-any-good-in-black-ops-6">Is the SWAT 5.56 any good in Black Ops 6?</h2>



<p>The SWAT 5.56 is a decent weapon choice as there are better options available. The things that set this weapon back are its slow TTK and mobility – two crucial aspects of multiplayer.</p>



<h2 id="h-best-alternatives-to-the-swat-5-56-in-black-ops-6">Best alternatives to the SWAT 5.56 in Black Ops 6</h2>



<p>The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-dm-10-loadout-in-black-ops-6-attachments-perks-equipment/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">DM-10</a> is a great alternative to the SWAT 5.56 in BO6. However, if you want full-automatic options, then the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-xm4-loadout-in-black-ops-6-attachments-perks-equipment/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">XM4</a> and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-as-val-loadout-black-ops-6-attachments-perks-equipment/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">AS VAL</a> are two meta weapons you can use right now.</p>

<p>In a recent interview, Hermen Hulst and Hideaki Nishino, the two CEOs at the top of Sony Interactive Entertainment, appeared in the same chat for the first time since being appointed. It’s not the most conventional way to run a company, but Sony’s CEO believes it’s a recipe for success.</p>



<p>Hulst manages the studio side of things while Nishino oversees the platform operations. In a recent chat with Variety, the pair was grilled about all things PlayStation.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-it-s-our-duty-to-run-a-sustainable-business">“It’s Our Duty to Run a Sustainable Business”</h2>



<p>In Variety’s interview, the pair of CEOs first addressed the PS5 Pro, the next iteration of the PlayStation 5 that’s emerging at a very sketchy time for Sony. In recent months, the company has suffered under the weight of layoffs, studio closures, and scrutiny regarding the pricing point for this new powerhouse of a console.</p>



<p>Despite that, Hideaki Nishino remains optimistic:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We started working on PS5 Pro even before PS5 launches — it was another five-year project for us.</p>



<p>… we’re kind of happy to see, like most engaged gaming users are interested in the PS5 Pro, and then I’m pretty sure new users will grab the PS5 Pro as well. If it’s the PlayStation you want to get, that’s the thing. So that’s where we designed the generation at this moment. We design everything with having one ahead in our mind.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Hermen Hulst turned the talk away from hardware to what’s lined up in PlayStation’s portfolio, including new titles like Ghost of Yotei and live-action adaptations. He revealed that The Last of Us (HBO) was such a roaring success that it has been considered a ‘game changer’:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We learned a lot from that.</p>



<p>At PlayStation productions, we have 10 productions now in the works: “The Last of Us,” “Twisted Metal,” a few others that we’re very excited about.</p>



<p>We’re talking about adaptations, but in adaptations, that’s taking the game and then see what else you can do with it. We’re actually looking to build from the ground up — as we tried to do originally with “Horizon,” in creating this world and creating this storyline — and how can you tell stories in this world on various mediums?</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Rounding out the interview with Variety, Hulst touched on a sore spot – the recent layoffs that hit PlayStation’s subsidiaries, including the shutdown of Concord and Firewalk Studios.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>It’s our duty to look at our our resource planning, and make sure that we run a sustainable business. That’s part of being CEO. We never take that lightly, because we know these people personally, and it’s very close to our hearts and the teams and good working atmospheres. But yes, we’ve had some layoffs.</p>



<p>But it’s also important to realize that on the content side, PlayStation Studios is now a much bigger organization than when it started. It’s grown tremendously. And that is organic growth that our existing teams, I think, hired quite aggressively, as well as through M&amp;A. So the organization, the employment is much greater now than it was, let’s say, for example, five years ago.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>If you want the full meat on the bones, <a href="https://variety.com/2024/gaming/news/playstation-ceos-hideaki-nishino-hermen-hulst-1236194125/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">you can visit Variety</a> for the complete interview.</p>

But there's a small challenge that comes with plumbing its depths: all the insights you find were most apropos for the year they were archived.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Some talks might evergreen, but others fade away as console generations advance and the industry landscape changes. The landscape that's arguably seen the most change is the economic state of the game industry. The already-turbulent business has been upended in the last two years, with studios laying off thousands of workers and investors closing their doors to anyone not pitching the next </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Fortnite</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In 2019 </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://finji.co//">Finji</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> cofounder and CEO Bekah Saltsman gave a talk for indie developers on pitching publishers. The talk was direct, to-the-point, and challenged developers to accept they were playing in a crowded market, and their pitches needed to be the best they could be for a shot at publisher support.</span></p><iframe title="Embedded content" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MP-nmrMb9FQ" height="nullpx" width="100%" data-testid="iframe" scrolling="auto"></iframe><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Five years later, that fact is more true than ever. Saltsman admitted in an email interview with Game Developer that she's not an "optimistic person" anymore about the game industry and funding opportunities. She's still out there though, signing games like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://wilmotworksitout.com/">Wilmot Works It Out</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and continuing to support titles like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1148760/I_Was_a_Teenage_Exocolonist/">I Was a Teenage Exocolonist</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1123450/Chicory_A_Colorful_Tale/">Chicory: A Colorful Tale</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">. She's also doing pitching of her own, often looking for funds to support those games.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a data-discover="true" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/why-is-it-so-expensive-to-make-games-in-the-united-states-" target="_self">Why is it so expensive to make games in the United States?</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Saltsman seems more world-weary, but she took the time to tell Game Developer—and more importantly, our readers in search of funds—what she's expecting out of pitches now, and how her assessments of the industry have changed.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Changing economics mean changing budgets">Changing economics mean changing budgets</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In 2019,</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span> </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">Saltsman explained Finji sorts pitches into different tiers where they assess how many copies a game they're pitching or being pitched might sell. They range from as few as 300 units to as high as 300,000 units and beyond (the last category was an outlier, to be clear). Most games the company publishes target the 3000-30,000 range.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">They're still the tiers it uses, though Saltsman said she would add a "small increment" between the 3k and 300k range. "I would likely add a small increment between 30k and 100k" she wrote. "I would do this because hitting 100k copies of an indie game on a single platform can be quite difficult."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Budgets for games are even higher than they were when I gave this talk—and I am talking about North America specifically. It is so much more expensive for normal people </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/why-is-it-so-expensive-to-make-games-in-the-united-states-">to make ends meet in the US</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and that directly affects your game budget."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Should you include your budget in your pitch documents? The answer is still "no." "I put a lot of other information in there," she said. "I put my goals of the pitch, which might be something like 'we are looking for an enthusiastic partner who wants to make something special and wants to work with our team. We are looking for finishing development funds, a co-marketing partner, and a team who wants to ship this game alongside us.'"</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Image via Northway Games/Finji.</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">She said it clearly communicates what she's looking for: that Finji is looking for money, that it is looking for 'end of project' money, and when the pitch goes to platform owners, that the team is seeking an account rep or production team to help the developer out.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Saltsman still has a budget prepped—it's just not something she shares up front. She said that "the last thing you want to do is to get someone to respond to you and ask how much and you aren't ready to talk about that." Her budgets are standalone documents that estimate production costs, unit sales information at "various launch price points" and a breakdown of milestones that would correlate to budget payments. She'll make several of these documents to be prepared for different prospective partners.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Her documents will clearly state the costs of the game she wants to make, the game that can be made if a certain amount is cut, the amount that can be produced if Finji needs to make a "minimum viable product," and the game that she wants to make plus 6 months of content post-launch.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">That's four flexible models, multiplied across many documents. Devs should definitely take time to get the math right before sending them out in the world.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Be flexible with storefronts and people you're pitching">Be flexible with storefronts and people you're pitching</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Speaking of flexibility, Saltsman's original talk breaks down how devs should be prepared to pitch their games to all kinds of parties. Investors. Publishers. Players. Your dog, cat, or ferret. Your mom. Your stepmom. Your polycule's extended branch that stretches into the finance world and there's that guy Jim who hangs out sometimes but his dad is a dentist who patented a chemical that helps teeth deal with aging and you know what this just kind of got out of hand.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"I will never stop encouraging developers to learn about people," Saltsman said (no reference to the dentist, but she did press learning how to talk to "friends, parents, and partners."). "If you are going to be in charge of walking in and out of pitch meetings, going to shows to talk to fans, taking press interviews—you need to practice communicating."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Because developers can wind up in a state of "culture isolation" (talking to other developers and becoming familiar with words like 'blueprints,' 'jungling,' or 'bunny-hopping'), they'll start to speak in ways that are intelligible to ordinary people not cursed by such knowledge. "It's like when you're in the grocery store and middle school kids behind you in the queue are speaking in YouTube," she said.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In 2019, Saltsman stumbled on another form of flexibility that's evolved her approach since. After being left scrambling for the Nintendo Switch launch of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Night in the Woods</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, Finji grabbed some assets for Nintendo's storefront that they hadn't really intended to be public-facing. It turned out they were perfectly optimized for that platform. Should developers prep different assets for different storefronts today?</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Short answer: yes," she said, implying she'd give an "entire talk" on the subject. "Slightly longer short answer: every platform has a different audience who have different expectations. It is your job as a developer (or at least the person communicating to the world about your game) to understand how these different platforms work. This directly influences how your art assets and store text are interpreted."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"You should understand your audiences—your first audience who will buy it on day one, your second audience who will buy it in the first month, your 3rd audience who need some peer pressure and validation from others and your long tail sale audience. Your assets: visual, both static and video—and text-based—should communicate with those first 3 audiences directly."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Stay tuned for more from Saltsman on that. Hopefully we'll see that talk sometime soon.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Do not. Just pitch. A prototype.">Do not. Just pitch. A prototype.</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">2024 Bekah Saltsman is just as ardent as 2019 Bekah Saltsman on the subject of prototypes. She does not want to see them in a pitch. Developers, she said, should head into pitches with vertical slices. "The idea of a prototype is still that it is playable version of your game that is a proof of system or proof of mechanics. This is not enough for most people to understand what the game actually is."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"In general, you still want to work toward a playable that shows a publishing or funding partner what the game will be like when it ships."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Image via Hollow Ponds/Richard Hogg/Finji.</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Don't panic, you don't need the most polished vertical slice or a full-on Steam Next Fest demo ready (couldn't hurt though). Her advice is once again, about communication. Developers want the biz dev person in the room to understand very clearly what the game is like and who it can be marketed to.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">You can stuff your vertical slice with everything it needs to communicate genre, "vibes," and what players will do in the game.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"It is more competitive now than it was five years ago," she noted. "There are less resources to go around. Show up with your best chance to secure your funding or your contract."</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Be business-minded, even if you don't have a head for it">Be business-minded, even if you don't have a head for it</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In a perfect world, the artists would get to practice the art, the technicians research their tech, and the money people work hard to get the money to the people who need it the most. However we live in a world where </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0851851/">Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> did not get a third season—the tiniest indicator that we are not in a perfect world.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It's a post-pandemic world where everyone is exhausted by the still-lingering presence of COVID-19, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/war-in-ukraine">wars</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/10/16/middleeast/israel-hamas-gaza-war-explained-week-2-mime-intl/index.html">invasions</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, inflation (or is it </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/podcasts/archive/2024/10/greedflation-inflation-grocery-prices-corporate-greed/680432/">greedflation</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">?) and...well, you get it.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Tight funding for games is maybe among the more minor plights we face, but if you're an indie out there struggling to get funds, Saltsman feels your pain. "People funding prototypes existed for about 20-24 months, but they have mostly canceled or cut all their projects loose. Diversity funds, platform funds, angel funds, investor funds—all are at a fraction of what they used to be."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Indie developers, she said, need to do their best to be "less of a risk." They can do that by having a better vertical slice, a wide array of funding methods, and being ready to adapt to whatever comes next.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"You have to spend some time on business."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Game Developer and Game Developers Conference are sibling organizations under Informa Tech.</span></span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Senior Editor, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Bryant Francis is a writer, journalist, and narrative designer based in Boston, MA.

<p>With its release just days away, Vertigo Games has released the first seven minutes of gameplay from Metro Awakening.</p>



<p>The gameplay, which you can watch below, contains the prologue for the game.</p>

<p>“Written by&nbsp;Metro&nbsp;author and creator Dmitry Glukhovsky,&nbsp;Metro Awakening&nbsp;plunges players into the unforgiving, post-apocalyptic world of Metro through immersive VR, unveiling the origin story of Khan, one of the franchise’s most beloved and intriguing characters,” the game’s description says.</p>



<p>The game will act as a prequel to 2010’s Metro 2033.</p>



<p>In his <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/metro-awakening-preview-apocalypse/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">preview of the game</a>, Insider Gaming’s Grant Taylor-Hill said that Metro Awakening feels “true to the franchise” despite it being a VR game.</p>



<p>“I can’t stress how true to the franchise Metro Awakening remains,” he said. “It helps that it has always been an immersive FPS series, but the VR perspective takes things one step further, planting you as close to the post-apocalyptic world as you’d ever want to be.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Metro Awakening launches on November 7, and will be available on Steam VR, PlayStation VR 2, Meta Quest, and Viveport. Stay tuned for Insider Gaming’s full review around its release.</p>

And while only Nintendo Switch games are currently available as themes, a hacker has already found a way to run custom code on the Alarmo.</p><p>A user who goes by GaryOderNichts--who is known for his ability to reverse-engineer and hack the Wii U--demonstrated his Alarmo hack on X by showing the alarm clock using a picture of a cat instead of one of Nintendo's chosen themes.</p><p>GaryOderNichts also posted a lengthy explanation about how he pulled off the hack<a href="https://garyodernichts.blogspot.com/2024/10/looking-into-nintendo-alarmo.html" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow"> on his blog</a>. The short version is that before he could get into the inner workings of the Alarmo, the firmware had to be decrypted and uploaded to an external USB. Removing the firmware file from the Alarmo allows users to get it to accept customized code via a USB. There may be limits as to what can be put on an Alarmo, since it wasn't designed to play games. But this could be an important first step for allowing users to upload custom themes of their own, assuming Nintendo doesn't find a way to prevent it from happening with future Alarmo firmware updates.</p><p>Alarmo is currently available through Nintendo stores and for Nintendo Switch Online subscribers. However, the wide release of Alarmo won't arrive until next year. Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-music-app-provides-the-soundtrack-for-the-wait-for-switch-2/1100-6527499/" data-ref-id="1100-6527499">Nintendo's new music app has already dropped</a>. which gives fans something to listen to as we await word about the Switch 2. </p>

                <p>A labor union representing game developers has harshly criticized Sony's recent decision to close two studios, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-shuts-down-concord-permanently-shutters-dev-firewalk-studios/1100-6527460/" data-ref-id="1100-6527460">including Concord developer Firewalk</a>, saying the gaming giant is acting in an anti-competitive and monopolistic manner.</p><p>In a <a href="https://cwa-union.org/news/releases/statement-cwa-following-studio-closures-and-layoffs-sony-interactive-entertainment" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">statement</a>, the Communications Workers of America (CWA) said Sony's recent decision to close Concord studio Firewalk and mobile game outfit Neon Koi "makes it clear that now more than ever, video game workers deserve a free and fair opportunity to join together to form unions."</p><p>The video game industry has been rocked by mass layoffs and other significant shifts in recent years, and the CWA said the decisions to cut staff and cancel projects came from "highly insulated video game CEOs."</p><p>The CWA statement went on to claim that Sony continues to act in a monopolistic way through the closure of studios and elimination of jobs.</p><p>"Sony's decision to dissolve studios outside their walled garden of PlayStation-exclusive content rather than making games that have to compete in the highly diverse and competitive mobile game market should be a cautionary warning sign of Sony's interest in furthering its monopoly position in the video game industry," the group said.</p><p>Industry analyst Daniel Ahmad doesn't agree with the logic here. He <a href="https://x.com/ZhugeEX/status/1852021112399388939" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">said on social media</a>, "The argument doesn't hold in this specific instance. The studios didn't have dominant positions prior to being acquired. It was a consequence of poor management."</p><p>The CWA went on to say it will raise its concerns about Sony's "increasing monopoly and monopsony power" with regulators, policymakers, and stakeholders in the future.</p><p>Nearly 250 people at Fallout and Elder Scrolls developer Bethesda Game Studios recently <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bethesda-game-studios-is-now-unionized-across-the-board-recognized-by-microsoft/1100-6525206/" data-ref-id="1100-6525206">formed a union with the CWA</a>. This is part a wider trend in the video game industry of teams seeking collective bargaining agreements that seems to be picking up steam of late.</p><p>According to a <a href="https://kotaku.com/firewalk-studios-concord-ps5-sony-live-service-shutdown-1851684290" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">report from Kotaku</a>, the initial development contract for Concord amounted to $200 million--that figure was reportedly not sufficient to cover all game development costs. It also is claimed to be separate from costs related to Sony buying Firewalk and obtaining the Concord IP rights.</p><p>Concord was online for less than a month before Sony announced it would bring the game offline and refund all players. There was a period of time when some believed the game might resurface with a new business model or other changes, but <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-shuts-down-concord-permanently-shutters-dev-firewalk-studios/1100-6527460/" data-ref-id="1100-6527460">that is not going to happen.</a></p><p>While Concord the game is not moving forward, the franchise will <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/concord-to-remain-a-part-of-amazons-new-video-game-tv-show-despite-shutdown/1100-6526325/" data-ref-id="1100-6526325">still show up in Prime Video's video game TV series Secret Levels</a>, which premieres this December.</p>

		<p>Hot on the heels of the most recent Steam Next Fest, and just in time for Halloween, here’s a selection of some of the most promising horror titles coming your way over the next few months. This year has already been a strong one for horror with the excellent <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/14/silent-hill-2-2024-review/">Silent Hill 2 Remake</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/12/hollowbody-review/">Hollowbody</a>, whilst I previewed the great <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/01/becrowned-is-as-close-to-an-old-school-silent-hill-as-you-can-get/">Becrowned</a> a few weeks ago, but the future is looking even more scarily good with these eight games.</p>
<h3>Among Ashes (PS5, PC – December 2024)</h3>
<p><em><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2430900/Among_Ashes/">Demo available on Steam</a></em></p>
<p><iframe title="Among Ashes - Horror Game Release Window Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4rJsovQKcbU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The first game on this list actually comprises three different gaming experiences in one spooky package. You begin by playing a generic Doom clone on an early 2000s looking PC before your gaming is interrupted by a chat message from a friend telling you about a cursed exe that he has heard about. Once you’ve downloaded this in-game, you then embark on a wonderfully retro first person Resident Evil style adventure. The demo gives a decent amount of gameplay in this second style before closing out by teasing an intrusion into the real space of the player in the game.&nbsp;I’m excited to see how these different levels will interact in the full version.</p>

<h3>Below, Rusted Gods (PC, Q1 2025)</h3>
<p><em><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2895680/Below_Rusted_Gods/">Demo available on Steam</a></em></p>
<p><iframe title="Below Rusted Gods - DEMO AVAILABLE for FREE on Steam" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/y9gGtygCFsk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>A deeply atmospheric management game where you are the sole radio contact for a group exploring a mysterious passage that has opened up in a research lab. You have to monitor various machines that monitor the team’s progress and give appropriate advice whilst also dealing with strange happenings in the base. The demo feels quite self contained as a short experience so I’m intrigued how a longer version will work.</p>
<h3>Butcher’s Creek (PC, TBC)</h3>
<p><em><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2512560/Butchers_Creek/">Demo available on Steam</a></em></p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="BUTCHER'S CREEK - Pre-Release Gameplay Teaser" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WHYGSdC1x0k?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>This grubby grimehouse first person melee focused game absolutely nails the exploitation vibe and takes clear inspiration from both Condemned: Criminal Origins and Manhunt. You get captured by a snuff film making gang and must bludgeon your way out. Healing requires you to take photos of blood and gore so you have to actually check out your surroundings which is neat. This is looking perfect for fans of Puppet Combo games and their ilk.</p>
<h3>Don’t Fret (PC, TBC)</h3>
<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2716830/Dont_Fret/"><em>Demo available on Steam</em></a></p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="DON'T! FRET - DEMO ANNOUNCEMENT TRAILER | Upcoming Horror Game" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TkCD_dxdNc4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>I’m not normally one for mascot horror, having bounced off the original Five Nights franchise, but Don’t Fret is far more of a game than is usual for the subgenre. You play as an anthropomorphic guitar lost in a dark and mysterious musical college that serves as a metaphor for childhood traumas. You must explore, solve puzzles, and avoid the dangerous teaching staff that embody your deepest fears. The soundtrack is produced by a number of prominent YouTube musicians and this plays like a real labour of love.</p>
<h3>Echoes of the Living (PC, 2024)</h3>
<p><em><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2173460/Echoes_of_the_Living/">Demo available on Steam</a></em></p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Echoes Of The Living - Updated Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vKDq9X0_ldI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Bucking the trend for recent Silent Hill inspired titles, Echoes of the Living is a clear homage to vintage Resident Evil. I’ve played several demos of this game over the past few years and it is just getting increasingly more polished and exciting every time. The most recent demo acts as a prologue and introduces you to one of the playable characters, Liam. The game plays out much like an HD upscale of Resident Evil 2 or Nemesis and absolutely nails the look and feel of the genre. Without any hyperbole this is my most anticipated indie horror game.</p>
<h3>Heartworm (2025)</h3>
<p><em><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1257030/Heartworm/">Demo available on Steam</a></em></p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Heartworm Trailer | Coming 2025" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kvuFt-JyvQ4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Probably the most well known title on this list, Heartworm has had a somewhat troubled time in development with publisher difficulties but has now found a home with Dread XP. Completing a trilogy of Silent Hill inspired games alongside Hollowbody and Becrowned, Heartworm embraces tank controls whilst offering both fixed camera and over the shoulder perspectives. You play as Sam, who has lost those she loves and finds herself trapped in a nightmare of ghosts and alternate dimensions. The demo also included a boss fight with a giant spider that shows off how the camera based combat will play out. This looks set to be a new classic of the genre.</p>
<h3>Ritual Tides (PC, Consoles – Q3 2025)</h3>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Ritual Tides - Official Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wBt0urULPAI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>This is the most mysterious and enigmatic title on this list, as it was only officially announced this week, but has already made quite a stir in horror circles. This will be the first game from Vertpoint Studios, but the team is made up of industry veterans who clearly have ambitious plans. Little is known yet outside of some concept art and the vague description of the player washing up on an isolated island off the coast of Cornwall but the premise and sounds fantastic and the pedigree of those involved is unquestioned. Look out for more details as we get them.</p>
<h3>Sparrow (PC, coming soon)</h3>
<p><em><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2983920/SPARROW/">Demo available on Steam</a></em></p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="SPARROW - Gameplay Footage #1 | Sci-Fi Horror Game" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HpNodZgCzaE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>As a complete departure from the nostalgic homages to genre classics, Sparrow is an original and awesome concept for a horror game. You play as a little sparrow looking for your chicks, but are in constant danger from lots and lots of spiders. The main flying mechanics proved to be a little tricky at first in the demo, but that just adds to the challenge. Once you get the hang of them you’ll be pulling off some sweet moves swooping and diving away from predators. The demo ends on a real cliffhanger, by introducing an entirely new type of enemy. The whole thing reminds me of a species switch of the fantastic but forgotten Wii exclusive Dangerous Creatures.</p>
<hr>
<p>So, there you have it, eight incredible horror games to look out for between now and next Halloween. The sheer range and depth of the indie horror scene is fantastic to see and there are many other titles that just missed out on this list. So, whether you want nostalgic survival horror, creepy mascot frights, or entirely new takes on terror, you’ll find something to suit you. And remember, kids, horror games aren’t just for October and can be played and enjoyed all year round!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/iwgb-game-workers-union-first-manifesto<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>UK-based gaming union IWGB Game Workers has released its first manifesto, which it says sets out "a vision for a better industry", and it includes policies like a four-day working week, an end to the gender pay gap, and more.</p>

<p>Over on <a href="https://www.gameworkers.co.uk/manifesto/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">the union's website</a>, IWGB Game Workers says its manifesto is part of envisioning a future "where job insecurity, long unpaid hours, and inadequate compensation are a thing of the past".</p>

<p>First, the union sets out its mission, which includes a "seat at the table", as well as safe and secure jobs that are fairly compensated, solidarity and connection "outside of corporate spaces", and the championing of "diversity, inclusion, and social justice".</p>

<p>Under the "campaigns" section, the union outlines some of its core principles, which include ambitious goals like an end to crunch culture, a universal four-day work week across the industry with no salary reduction, and more inclusive hiring processes, among many others.</p>

<p>In an accompanying press release, Game Workers chair Austin Kelmore says the industry has <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/this-week-in-gaming-business-june-14th">"reached a tipping point"</a>, and that industry workers are "unionizing on a scale never seen before", exhorting industry employees to stand together to "make sure the games industry's future looks very different".</p>

<p>IWGB Game Workers BAME officer Charlie Webb, meanwhile, says that the layoffs and tumult of the last year or so have "revealed the underlying instability of the game industry", and that the union's new manifesto represents a "sustainable, sane, and healthy path forward".</p>

It’s the last day of October and Nintendo still hasn’t revealed the one thing every fan is waiting for. Instead, we’ve gotten almost everything else the company could think of, from random ports of cult Wii U games to literal alarm clocks. What else could the gaming giant throw at fans while it continues running out the clock on a new console announcement in 2024?</p><p>The signs were there, from mysterious leakers to the company’s own president. “We will make an announcement about the successor to Nintendo Switch within this fiscal year,” Shuntaro Furukawa tweeted back in May. Technically, Nintendo’s fiscal year runs until March 31, but my god, man! Give us a single image of the hardware, an official name, anything! Five months later, fans have survived heart-stopping levels of hype ever since the company ditched its regular September Nintendo Direct and chatter from developers and others about an imminent announcement reached a fever pitch. </p><p>With all eyes on the mustachioed plumber, the console manufacturer decided on a different course of action. Instead of revealing the Switch 2, Nintendo <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-alarmo-clock-mario-date-preorder-1851668614?_gl=1*1yaztip*_ga*MzQzNjkwNDM2LjE2NDY2NjQ1NzQ.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTczMDM4NzgyNi41NC4wLjE3MzAzODc4NTAuMzYuMC4w&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-alarmo-clock-mario-date-preorder-1851668614?_gl=1*1yaztip*_ga*MzQzNjkwNDM2LjE2NDY2NjQ1NzQ.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTczMDM4NzgyNi41NC4wLjE3MzAzODc4NTAuMzYuMC4w">announced Alarmo</a></span>, a $100 device that uses video-game sounds to get you out of bed, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-alarmo-preorder-scalpers-bed-1851670175&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-alarmo-preorder-scalpers-bed-1851670175">at least if you’re single</a></span>. We got a mysterious online playtest announcement that <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/nintendo-playtest-switch-2-mario-mmo-1851677142&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-playtest-switch-2-mario-mmo-1851677142">turned out to be for a weird MMO</a></span>. On a random Tuesday, Nintendo decided to drop the news that niche <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/xenoblade-chronicles-x-switch-2-port-release-date-rpg-1851683819&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/xenoblade-chronicles-x-switch-2-port-release-date-rpg-1851683819">Wii U exclusive <em>Xenoblade Chronicles X</em></a></span> would all of a sudden, 10 years later, arrive on Switch next spring. And then last night the company busted out even more news: Nintendo music <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/NintendoAmerica/status/1851747457853440212&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/NintendoAmerica/status/1851747457853440212" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">now has a standalone app</a></span> for smartphone listening as part of Switch Online. </p><p>It now feels like time is running out for Nintendo to actually reveal the Switch 2 before the end of 2024. Maybe there’s a small pocket of time in November before the holiday, but why would the company decide to steal thunder  from <em>Mario &amp; Luigi: Brothership</em> or its big holiday push to help sell <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-limited-edition-zelda-echoes-sales-1851611733&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-limited-edition-zelda-echoes-sales-1851611733">another 10 million more Switches this year</a></span>. Maybe Nintendo just does not give a fuck anymore, confident in the knowledge that, whenever it chooses to announce its next console, the news will bend the attention economy to its will no matter the manner or timing in which it unfolds. Or maybe this means we really aren’t getting a Switch 2 reveal before mid-January after the holiday break. </p><p>In the meantime, here are nine more things I would be less shocked to see Nintendo announce between now and then that aren’t a Switch 2. </p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="6579cf2f9c94813e3b0bce1b4fd62154" data-recommend-id="image://6579cf2f9c94813e3b0bce1b4fd62154" data-format="png" data-width="1900" data-height="950" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="An orange N64 sits on a white surface.

Six years later, maybe the nostalgia trip has finally come into view. Of course I know there are already N64 games on Switch Online. And yes, a series of official, translucent N64s in retro colors housing cheap emulators would absolutely still sell out like crazy.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="08ed8f5803ec07e42dc6f726cdb68f6f" data-recommend-id="image://08ed8f5803ec07e42dc6f726cdb68f6f" data-format="png" data-width="1600" data-height="900" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A GameCube falls into the abyss " data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A GameCube falls into the abyss " data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="getty" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Photo<!-- -->: <!-- -->Edge Magazine<!-- --> (<!-- -->Getty Images<!-- -->)</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="08ed8f5803ec07e42dc6f726cdb68f6f" data-recommend-id="image://08ed8f5803ec07e42dc6f726cdb68f6f" data-format="png" data-width="1600" data-height="900" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A GameCube falls into the abyss " data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Once again, logic would tell you that Nintendo is already investing so much in bespoke ports, remakes, and remasters of its GameCube back catalog that it would not undercut those premium boxed game sales with an all-you-can-eat Switch Online buffet of emulated games. But you and I both know Nintendo is the king of the double-dip and fans will just spend money on both. </p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="60a2463dc42fed15386e37f7f50d85ee" data-recommend-id="image://60a2463dc42fed15386e37f7f50d85ee" data-format="png" data-width="827" data-height="557" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A Star Fox Muppet gets excited " data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A Star Fox Muppet gets excited " data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="60a2463dc42fed15386e37f7f50d85ee" data-recommend-id="image://60a2463dc42fed15386e37f7f50d85ee" data-format="png" data-width="827" data-height="557" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A Star Fox Muppet gets excited " data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Last November, Shigeru Miyamoto was out here tweeting about a live-action <em>Zelda</em> movie like he had just woken up that day and decided to make one happen. Well, the best live-action thing Nintendo has ever done was its <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RpipJToXKQ&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RpipJToXKQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2015 E3 showcase featuring Muppets</a></span>, and while only 10 people in the world are asking for a <em>Star Fox </em>movie right now, I would totally go see one if it went full Jim Henson. </p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="eeb8ca0215c7cbbb0b996863f37fcad7" data-recommend-id="image://eeb8ca0215c7cbbb0b996863f37fcad7" data-format="png" data-width="1402" data-height="788" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Unreal Engine 5 Link pulls back an arrow on his bow" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><span data-id="eeb8ca0215c7cbbb0b996863f37fcad7" data-recommend-id="image://eeb8ca0215c7cbbb0b996863f37fcad7" data-format="png" data-width="1402" data-height="788" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Unreal Engine 5 Link pulls back an arrow on his bow" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>I don’t even think anyone would be pissed about this one. I will always take a new sequel over a remake, but at the rate it now takes for new games to come out, I wouldn’t be opposed to an <em>Ocarina of Time</em> remake. I’ve been reading the manga based on the game with my kid and would love to show him the original game but I don’t have the patience to teach him those finicky camera controls after the boundless freedom of <em>Tears of the Kingdom</em>. </p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="516064d7b2b4c97c056432092804442b" data-recommend-id="image://516064d7b2b4c97c056432092804442b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Birdo holds up a tennis racket " data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Birdo holds up a tennis racket " data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="516064d7b2b4c97c056432092804442b" data-recommend-id="image://516064d7b2b4c97c056432092804442b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Birdo holds up a tennis racket " data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The fans cry out for a savior. Is it Birdo? No. But that wouldn’t stop her from finally getting the solo spin-off she’s earned from grinding it out across all of those multiplayer franchises. I’m imagining a classic 2D platformer where she collects eggs to get new abilities that open up the map, Metroidvania-style. Knowing Nintendo though, a Birdo game will be something so much weirder. </p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="0974becd49b2c5d3ed0f68c6deb6a116" data-recommend-id="image://0974becd49b2c5d3ed0f68c6deb6a116" data-format="png" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A Wii U playing Netflix is in a graveyard " data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A Wii U playing Netflix is in a graveyard " data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="shutterstock" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Romolo Tavani / Netflix / Nintendo / Kotaku<!-- --> (<!-- -->Shutterstock<!-- -->)</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="0974becd49b2c5d3ed0f68c6deb6a116" data-recommend-id="image://0974becd49b2c5d3ed0f68c6deb6a116" data-format="png" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A Wii U playing Netflix is in a graveyard " data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The Switch went nearly eight years without letting anyone watch Netflix shows on it.

Why finally announce a sequel when Nintendo could just keep turning around all of the remaining levels from older games that haven’t already been added yet? There are still so many to bring back, like Wuhu Island, Dry Dry Ruins, and <em>Double Dash</em>’s Rainbow Road. Nintendo will keep selling you DLC and you’ll like it because <em>Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</em> is one of like 20 perfect games that’s ever existed. </p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="adfd40882d8071cd67463d971863892c" data-recommend-id="image://adfd40882d8071cd67463d971863892c" data-format="png" data-width="2048" data-height="1274" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A Virtual Boy sits in front of a teal background " data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A Virtual Boy sits in front of a teal background " data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Photo<!-- -->: <!-- -->Evan Amos</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="adfd40882d8071cd67463d971863892c" data-recommend-id="image://adfd40882d8071cd67463d971863892c" data-format="png" data-width="2048" data-height="1274" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A Virtual Boy sits in front of a teal background " data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Every other major tech company and electronics manufacturer is struggling with VR right now. An entire freaking <em>Batman: Arkham Shadow</em> game came to Meta Quest 3 this month and nobody even remembers because virtual reality is a black hole that just sucks up money and makes people nauseous. So of course that means its the perfect time for Nintendo to get back into the market for VR headsets. While Meta and others pivot to augmented reality wearables, I fully expect Nintendo to unveil a 5-pound VR helmet shaped like a mushroom that lets you watch Netflix inside your <em>Animal Crossing: New Horizons </em>house. </p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="7d9dabce39279afc1615d451fdaa2ab0" data-recommend-id="image://7d9dabce39279afc1615d451fdaa2ab0" data-format="jpg" data-width="1062" data-height="597" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Anniversary art shows Mother 3 characters " data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Anniversary art shows Mother 3 characters " data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nobuhiro Imagawa</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="7d9dabce39279afc1615d451fdaa2ab0" data-recommend-id="image://7d9dabce39279afc1615d451fdaa2ab0" data-format="jpg" data-width="1062" data-height="597" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Anniversary art shows Mother 3 characters " data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>If there’s one company that <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/Reggie/status/1760728487114232002&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/Reggie/status/1760728487114232002" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">will never cave to peer pressure</a></span>, it’s Nintendo.

			<p>A new Dragon's Dogma 2 patch is now live on PC and consoles, introducing PlayStation 5 Pro support alongside some other changes and fixes.</p>
<p>Following the October 31st patch, the latest entry in the series by CAPCOM released earlier this year will be able to take advantage of the increased power and new features of the mid-generation console by Sony launching next week. The patch adds a PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution option to the Graphics section in the Options menu, and a Balanced option will be found under Graphics Quality in the Graphics section of the Options menu.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, the Dragon's Dogma 2 latest patch also fixes some quests, Pawn, minimap, and spell issues. You can find all the changes introduced by today's patch by heading over to the game's <a href="https://www.dragonsdogma.com/2/en-us/topics/update/">official website.</a></p>
<p>Dragon's Dogma 2 is now available on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S. You can learn more about the game by checking out Alessio's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/dragons-dogma-2-review-more-like-one-and-a-half/">review.</a></p>
<p><em>This review may read quite negatively, but it's only because of the lofty expectations that surrounded Dragon's Dogma 2. The original game was an amazing foundation to build upon, and yet CAPCOM seemed content with keeping the same strengths without improving much on the weaknesses. Twelve years later, though, the effect cannot be the same. Still, make no mistake: Dragon's Dogma 2 is a highly enjoyable fantasy action/adventure with RPG elements that will provide you with about 40 hours of pure fun. Its peerless sense of exploration, meaty combat system, and stunning visuals will motivate you throughout the entire playthrough. Just don't expect to find a fantasy world simulator or, indeed, a narrative worth remembering.</em></p>
