		<p>Nintendo has decided to postpone the date at which US gamers can pre-order the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a>, as the company tries to figure out the impact of the sweeping tariffs that the Trump administration has applies to goods imported from other countries. However, the pre-order date for other countries and regions is unchanged, and the console is still set for launch on 5th June 2025.</p>
<p>In a statement to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-preorder-guide-mario-kart-world-bundle/1100-6530531/">Gamespot</a>, Nintendo said:</p>


<p>“Pre-orders for Nintendo Switch 2 in the U.S. will not start April 9, 2025 in order to assess the potential impact of tariffs and evolving market conditions. Nintendo will update timing at a later date. The launch date of June 5, 2025 is unchanged.”</p>
<p>Nintendo originally announced that the console would cost $450 on its own or $500 with Mario Kart World bundled in, but with Nintendo being a Japanese company and their games consoles being assembled in China and Thailand using parts from South Korea, Taiwan and beyond, the cost of importing has just jumped up massively.</p>
<p>While Japan is subject to a 24% tariff rate, the rate for China to 34% and Thailand to 37% – <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c5ypxnnyg7jo">per the BBC</a> – and it’s the point of origin of manufacture in the latter two that would be most applicable here. With a roughly 33% jump, it could be a new $600 price point for the Switch in the US, before any state sales tax is applied.</p>

<p>Why these seemingly arbitrary numbers? While the Trump administrations claims to have used a sum of tariff rates and non-tariff barriers to figure out a cost to US company exports, <a href="https://www.snopes.com/news/2025/04/03/trump-tariff-formula/">posts online quickly deduced</a> that they are actually just using the trade deficit to a country, divided it by the country’s exports to the US, and made it a percentage. For any countries with a trade surplus to the US, such as the UK which buys more US goods than it sells to the US, they applied a standard 10%.</p>
<p>This array of tariffs has had a huge impact on global markets over the last couple of days, and will inevitably start to affect prices on store shelves soon. It also came at exactly the wrong time for Nintendo, but that hasn’t stopped US retailers from starting to put up shop pages for the console in preparation for pre-orders to go live for consoles, accessories and games.</p>

None of that has changed. For now. However, with this news and the ongoing <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/switch-2-price-mario-kart-world-nintendo-treehouse-live-1851774530&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-price-mario-kart-world-nintendo-treehouse-live-1851774530">backlash from players over game prices</a></span>, I’d say a lot of the Switch 2's rollout and pricing is up in the air.

Maybe they get doubled in some places out of spite. Maybe he declares video games illegal with an executive order. Folks, anything is possible right now. </p><p>It’s very rare that a major video game company like Nintendo would backpedal this quickly after announcing a date for pre-orders. Even weirder for Nintendo of all companies to directly tie its decision to President Trump by calling out his planned tariffs. But we are living in wild and unprecedented times, something I’m remined of every single time I check social media or the news. As you might expect during such a bizarre moment, a lot of people online reacted to the Switch 2 news. </p><p>Here are some of the more entertaining reactions, to distract you for just a few minutes from...everything. </p><figure id="" data-id="cf582b30c9739446c371b10e353702cf" data-recommend-id="image://cf582b30c9739446c371b10e353702cf" data-format="png" data-width="601" data-height="197"

            <p>
What better way to start winding down from a busy week of Switch 2 news than with a look at the ever-adorable <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/kirby-and-the-forgotten-land">Kirby and the Forgotten Land</a>, now strikingly remixed as part of an expanded edition coming to Nintendo's new console later this year? 'Go outside!' you might suggest, or 'Lie on my face and hum!', but for the purposes of this story it's Kirby, and we now have a clearer idea of what's coming in his previously announced Switch 2 enhanced edition.
</p>
<p>
Nintendo's calling its Switch 2 spruce-up Kirby and the Forgotten Land - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition + Star-Crossed World (let's be thankful we aren't getting tariffs on letters too), and it includes everything seen in the original Switch release - which we <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/kirby-and-the-forgotten-land-review-a-mouthful-of-magic">gave four stars to back in 2022</a> - alongside a bunch of new stuff. On the technical front, Kirby also gets a bump from 30fps to 60fps, and it'll be play at 1080p in handheld mode and 1440p docked.
</p>
<p>
The real draw, though, is the new content, which takes the form of a remixed campaign known as Star-Crossed World. As <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/9A3yMts15NU?feature=shared&amp;t=6458">revealed during Nintendo's Treehouse livestream</a>, this begins with a choice of difficulty - Wild Mode or Spring-Breeze Mode - with an on-screen message warning it's "a bit wilder and more challenging" than the base game. On the plus side, it rewards more coins. And, it's worth noting the new content is fully playable in co-op - one player taking on the role of Kirby, the other Bandana Waddle Dee - just like in the original version.

<p>
Star-Crossed World essentially play out across the base game's map, albeit with each level apparently heavily remixed to suit the expansion's 'mysterious crystal comet comes crashing down causing havoc' theme. Once again, for instance, Kirby's adventure begins on the shore of a sandy cove, but now it's littered with star-like crystals - and some these, crystal flowers, cause previously unseen pathways to form when struck.
</p>
<p>
Before long, Treehouse's demonstration reaches the overgrown city seen in the base game. Only this time - after a massive meteor crashes into a towering skyscraper - the streets are corrupted with shimmering blue hues and crystal protrusions. Some of them have even infected familiar enemies, giving them dainty little crystal mohawks and tougher attacks. And it doesn't take long for the new content to diverge from the original stage's route; rather than leading Kirby through the now-blocked streets, he follows a path of winding platforms up the exterior of a skyscraper, until the city - and the base game's familiar path - stretches out far below.
</p>
<p>
It's a similar story for the remixed version of the dilapidated fairground level shown next, which soon takes players away from ground level onto a vast crystal rollercoaster track winding high above the park. At one point, we see the return of the Mouthful Pipe power-up, as Kirby hurtles with increasing speed along the coaster's dips and rises, but the Treehouse crew stressed new power-ups also come into play. There's an adorable Mouthful Spring power-up transformation, for instance, letting Kirby bounce much higher than usual and slam heavily down.
</p>
<p>
Star-Crossed World also features new mini-bosses alongside tweaked variants of familiar foes, and it all points to an expansion that looks to diverge in some surprising ways despite it utilising existing levels. It's not entirely clear whether <em>every</em> base game stage has been remixed for the new campaign or if it's just a small selection, but Treehouse notes it'll be possible to access both variants on the overworld map once unlocked to make it easier to switch between modes.
</p>
<p>
Kirby and the Forgotten Land - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition + Star-Crossed World comes to the new console on 28th August, and it'll also be available as a paid upgrade for anyone that owns the Switch original - although prices have yet to be confirmed. It's just <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-will-have-paid-upgrades-for-certain-switch-games-bringing-enhanced-frame-rates-and-more">one of several games getting the enhanced Nintendo Switch 2 Edition treatment</a>, with <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/zelda-breath-of-the-wild-walkthrough-guide-tips-4857">The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-walkthrough-tips-9343">Tears of the Kingdom</a> also confirmed, alongside <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/metroid-prime-4">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/super-mario-party-jamboree">Super Mario Party Jamboree</a>, and Pokémon Legends: Z-A. Free (albeit less substantial) Switch 2 updates are also promised for some other Switch 1 games.
</p>
<p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/inzoi-eclipses-1-million-copies-sold-in-its-first-week/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Life simulation game <a href="https://wccftech.com/inzoi-will-require-a-rather-powerful-pc-ryzen-7-9800x3d-recommended-for-high-preset/">inZOI</a> arrived in early access last week on March 28, 2025, and in its first seven days, the new game from developer inZOI Studio and publisher Krafton has already eclipsed 1 million copies sold.</p>
<p>The studio announced the milestone through a <a href="https://x.com/PlayinZOI/status/1908082411906449478">post on its official X account,</a> thanking the players who've already jumped into the new highly detailed life simulation.</p>
<p><em>"It's a number that still feels unreal to us and a milestone we could not have reached without each and every one of you,</em>" the studio said in its post.</p>
<p>"<em>Your excitement, your creations, your feedback, your content, and your support have brought inZOI to life in ways we could have never imagined. From the very beginning, you've been shaping inZOI with us, and we're deeply grateful for the passion and love you've poured into it. We'll continue working hard to bring that promise to life - where every life becomes a story in inZOI."</em></p>
<p>Right at launch, inZOI jumped to the top of Steam's leaderboards just <a href="https://wccftech.com/inzoi-hits-1-on-steam-40-minutes-after-early-access-launch/">40 minutes</a> after the game went live. The game has clearly struck a chord with gamers who love a life-sim game and perhaps have been looking for a Sims alternative for a while, but the jury is still out if it'll have the legs to really challenge EA's long-running, genre-dominating series.</p>
<p>Krafton has already <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-sims-competitor-inzoi-sells-1-million-in-a-week-krafton-declares-it-a-long-term-franchise-ip">said</a> that it considers inZOI a&nbsp;<em>"long-term franchise IP,</em>" so at least for now, Krafton will continue to support it and try to make the new life-sim game a strong competitor to The Sims.</p>
<p>One key element to inZOI potentially having legs is that there's clearly a potential for the game to be involved in plenty of meme-able content and the odd scandal since inZOI Studios already had to patch out what the team said was an "<em>unintended bug</em>," that let players <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/inzoi-players-surprised-to-discover-you-can-run-over-children-despite-teen-rating">run over and kill little children</a>. Players quickly turned to <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/life-sim/after-hitting-kids-with-cars-was-patched-out-inzoi-players-are-now-kidnapping-babies/">kidnapping babies</a> instead.</p>

The studio known for single-player dark fantasy epics like <em>Elden Ring </em>and the <em>Dark Souls </em>series is now working on two multiplayer games.</p><div><blockquote><div><p>As a side note, please allow me to address one thing. As previously mentioned, this is an online multiplayer title at its core, but this doesn’t mean that we as a company have decided to shift to a more multiplayer-focused direction with titles going forward.</p><p>The Nintendo Switch 2 version of <em>Elden Ring </em>was also announced, and we still intend to actively develop single player focused games such as this that embrace our more traditional style.</p></div></blockquote></div><p>The <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nintendo.com%2Fus%2Fwhatsnew%2Fcreators-voice-the-duskbloods-part-1%2F" rel="sponsored">three</a>-<a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nintendo.com%2Fus%2Fwhatsnew%2Fcreators-voice-the-duskbloods-part-2%2F" rel="sponsored">part</a> <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nintendo.com%2Fus%2Fwhatsnew%2Fcreators-voice-the-duskbloods-part-3%2F" rel="sponsored">interview</a> also goes into much further detail on <em>The Duskbloods</em> than we saw in the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/638604/nintendo-switch-2-direct-news-trailers-stream">Nintendo Switch 2</a> direct teaser. The new game certainly looks <em>Bloodborne</em>-adjacent, but its multiplayer format is a significant departure. It also differs quite a bit from the other upcoming FromSoft multiplayer game, <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/610585/elden-ring-nightreign-hands-on-preview">Elden Ring Nightreign</a></em> — which is directed by <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/612715/elden-ring-nightreign-game-director-interview">Junya Ishizaki</a> and due out in late-May. Where <em>Nightreign </em>is a fully co-operative players vs enemies (PvE) <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/614995/elden-ring-nightreign-tests-verge-staff-thoughts">battle royale experience</a>, <em>Duskbloods </em>supports up to eight players in a PvPvE format.</p><p>Players will be able to choose from over a dozen characters, called “Bloodsworn.” They’re vampiric protagonists with superhuman abilities like super-jumps and double-jumps thanks to their consumption of special blood. Miyazaki noted, “As a general concept, they’re similar to vampires, but they are not portrayed as the horrifying monsters you might associate with traditional vampirism.” It sounds similar to the class-based system of<em> Elden Ring Nightreign</em>, but Miyazaki mentions the characters “can be customized to a certain extent.” (Fashion Souls fans, rejoice.)</p><p>Bloodsworn will compete for “first blood” across various maps with gothic and Victorian settings and vibes. Rounds will have varying objectives, with the de facto last player standing format sometimes tasking players to instead work together to take down a notable boss. But the emphasis isn’t solely on challenging combat, as players can earn “victory points” based from non-combat objectives as well. That may help those for whom PvP isn’t exactly their style — as Miyazaki confesses, “That was the intention. I personally am not much of a PvP person, and I wanted to make something that’s satisfying even for players like me.”</p><p>What may also appeal to the single-player crowd typical of FromSoftware’s fanbase is <em>The Duskbloods</em> will have its own dashes of deep-seeded lore that in some ways may connect to other <em>Souls</em> titles. For example, the winged rat at the end of the trailer is actually an “elderly gentleman” who “shares a similar role with the fire keepers from the Dark Souls series” and will be an NPC players can seek advice from in the hub world.</p><p><em>The Duskbloods</em> may have swerved some of us by looking the part of <em>Bloodborne </em>but turning out to be Switch 2-exclusive multiplayer battler, but personally I’m all for FromSoftware experimenting with different ideas. We’ll get a sampling of the studio’s multiplayer ambitions next month, when <em>Elden Ring Nightreign</em> launches May 30th, while Miyazaki has much more time to cook with <em>The Duskbloods </em>until it comes out in 2026.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

And with the new season arriving on April 11, 2025, we can expect even more changes. But if you’ve been a little checked out and are planning to return for Season Two and want to know where the meta currently is on this wildly successful hero shooter, especially if you favor Human Torch, Iron Man, and/or Cloak and Dagger, read on. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197298" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="108" data-playlist="197298,197284,197260" data-current="197298"><div><p>Live Forever in the Universe of 'New World: Aeternum'</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197298/197298_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"></video></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><h2 id="h138246"><a id=""></a>Recent meta changes</h2><figure id="" data-id="3736f5b50dcee9de75c955685e8b86ed" data-recommend-id="image://3736f5b50dcee9de75c955685e8b86ed" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Magneto appears in an MVP screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Magneto appears in an MVP screen." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvel Games / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="3736f5b50dcee9de75c955685e8b86ed" data-recommend-id="image://3736f5b50dcee9de75c955685e8b86ed" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Magneto appears in an MVP screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>After the last update, a lot of Strategist Ultimate abilities (Luna, Mantis, Invisible Woman, Cloak and Dagger) got their durations shortened and had their activation costs increased, which means <strong>it is harder for teams to simply save an Ultimate and win a team fight with it</strong>. Incredibly powerful Ultimates like <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-cloak-and-dagger-how-guide-support-duel-1851773368&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-cloak-and-dagger-how-guide-support-duel-1851773368">Cloak and Dagger’s</a></span> got significantly nerfed in particular. Because of this, a “dive” meta has emerged, with tanks like Captain America, Venom, and Thing and attackers like Spider-Man and others attacking enemy healers much more successfully. </p><p>Dr. Strange and Hulk have fallen off a bit, since they both got their maximum health reduced (and melee heroes like The Thing punch straight through Strange’s shield), so <strong>Magneto, Thing, and Groot are more prevalent</strong>. With dive characters being more powerful, anti-dive characters like Namor and even Peni Parker (particularly in triple-Vanguard teams) are seeing more play. </p><figure id="" data-id="0c9ab3e9994467789463711aa85947bb" data-recommend-id="image://0c9ab3e9994467789463711aa85947bb" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Namor appears in an MVP screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Namor appears in an MVP screen." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvel Games / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="0c9ab3e9994467789463711aa85947bb" data-recommend-id="image://0c9ab3e9994467789463711aa85947bb" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Namor appears in an MVP screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Now let’s talk about a few specific character balance changes.</p><h2 id="h138247"><a id="torch"></a>Human Torch changes</h2><p><strong>Human Torch’s primary attack now travels faster and has two more projectiles, making him better at taking out single targets, particularly at close range</strong> (such as after his ground slam ability). His Ultimate is now more expensive and takes longer to charge, but it does more damage, meaning it’s a bigger threat than before.</p><h2 id="h138248"><a id="ironman"></a>Iron Man changes</h2><p>Iron Man got buffed in several ways, but took a few nerfs too.. His single target go-to ability “Uni-beam” got buffed, dealing more damage. When he is teamed up with Hulk, it still boosts the damage further, but not by nearly as much, making the Gamma Team-Up less necessary for him to do his best work. He also had his Repulsor Blast (primary attack) damage reduced when hitting enemies directly, but the spell field (splash) damage increased, meaning <strong>he’ll be better at taking out groups of enemies but worse at single target damage</strong>. This creates clear use cases for Uni-beam and Repulsor Blast, so make sure you are getting close and using Uni-beam when taking out single targets and major threats, and Repulsor Blast against grouped up enemies.</p><h2 id="h138249"><a id="cloakdagger"></a>Cloak &amp; Dagger changes</h2><p>Unlike the changes to Iron Man, <strong>Cloak and Dagger’s changes made their heals more effective with direct hits</strong>, with Dagger’s healing Lightforce Dagger doing 16 healing, up from 10. The spell field healing went down from 18 to 16, meaning she won’t do as much healing to surrounding allies. This means she’s better at healing single targets, which is something she suffered more at before. Invisible Woman, Luna, and Loki still do better single target healing, but this helps bridge the gap a bit. </p><hr><p>Naturally, we expect things to change up a bit once Season Two arrives next week. For now, if you’re looking to get some hours in with the current meta, these tips ought to prepare you for the state of the game as of early April, 2025. Now, if you don’t mind, me and my fellow Cloak &amp; Dagger players have to get back to fearing Magneto. Cheers!</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/exclusive-%E2%80%93-new-deus-ex-game-pitched-by-eidos-montreal.1155606/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/exclusive-new-deus-ex-game-pitched-by-eidos-montreal/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Eidos-Montreal wants to bring back Deus Ex, and it’s been looking for ways to do so. </p>



<p>While working on details regarding the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/eidos-montreal-another-embracer-studio-suffers-large-scale-layoffs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recent layoffs</a> at the Montreal, Quebec-based studio, it was learned that the company had been actively pitching to external partners and publishers a new Deus Ex game.</p>



<p>According to multiple sources close to the studio’s plans, Eidos-Montreal was pitching the new game regularly, but it hasn’t led to any commitments from publishers. </p>



<p>One source said that there was a belief from a couple possible partners that the series was “too niche” at this stage. Another said that it became clear after a few meetings that publishers aren’t willing to take on the financial risk that comes with the Deus Ex franchise at the moment.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Nintendo Switch 2 Reveal, Battlefield's Battle Royal, And A Game From A Classic Series Being Pitched" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XgveqrF7Sug?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Not much is known about the details behind this new Deus Ex game being pursued. However, it was said that the concept for the game had “charm and novelty”, but that it didn’t match up with the “expectations or standards typically associated with the Deus Ex brand”.</p>



<p>To make it clear, this game, sources say, is different from the one that had been in development for two years <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/embracer-cancels-deus-ex-game-lays-off-eidos-montreal-staff/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">before Embracer canceled</a> it in early 2024 as part of the parent company’s restructuring efforts. It was also said that the lack of agreement for the pitched game had nothing to do with the layoffs. Insider Gaming is working on more information surrounding what led to 75 people losing their jobs.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming reached out to Eidos-Montreal ahead of publishing this story. As of publishing, however, no response has been received. Should one come in, it will be added to this story.</p>

      </div>
<p dir="ltr">Rather than making a character from scratch, players will get to choose from over a dozen unique characters that have their "own identity and appearance," as well as unique weapons. Each character will have a weapon or tool to deal damage at a distance, as well the ability to summon an NPC to help them in battle.</p><p dir="ltr">Every Bloodsworn hero can also be customized. Miyazaki said characters can be "customized to a certain extent, allowing players the fun of building a character that feels like their own." Customization comes in the form of altering each character's "blood history and fate," Miyazaki said, which will have an effect on character abilities, appearance, and even how they might interact with other players. Progression will come from playing matches and completing objectives, which can then be used to further upgrade and customize each Bloodsworn character.</p><p dir="ltr">As for what players are actually trying to do during a session of The Duskbloods, Miyazaki said players will be competing to complete objectives, obtain Victory Points, and be the last Bloodsworn standing. There will also be personal objectives or special events to complete that will grant various rewards. Players will have some control over these, as Miyazaki said players can assign a "Role" to their character that may see players rewarded for teaming up with or eliminating a specific target.</p><p dir="ltr">It's a big departure for From Software's usual RPG fare, but already sounds similar to the studio's next game, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/elden-ring-nightreign/" data-ref-id="5000-654963">Elden Ring: Nightreign</a>. The multiplayer Elden Ring spin-off also features a roster of hero-like characters to choose from, as players team up to survive and defeat bosses over the course of a match. From Software recently revealed a new playable hero coming to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-new-ironeye-class-is-an-agile-archer-that-deals-death-from-afar/1100-6530523/" data-ref-id="1100-6530523">Elden Ring: Nightreign, the bow-wielding Ironeye</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">Despite the multiplayer focus of both Nightreign and The Duskbloods, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/from-software-is-not-abandoning-single-player-games-studio-boss-says/1100-6530620/" data-ref-id="1100-6530620">Miyazaki said From Software isn't giving up on single-player games</a>. He also said the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/from-softwares-switch-2-exclusive-was-originally-pitched-for-the-original-switch/1100-6530618/" data-ref-id="1100-6530618">The Duskbloods originally started as a project for the first Nintendo Switch</a>, before revamping the game's development with the new Switch 2 hardware in mind.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-preorder-guide-mario-kart-world-bundle/1100-6530531/" data-ref-id="1100-6530531">The Switch 2 is still currently set to release on June 5</a>, though preorders in the US have now been delayed as a result of new US tariff policies that could result in a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-price-likely-to-increase-as-nintendo-pulls-us-preorders-over-trumps-new-tariff-policies/1100-6530626/" data-ref-id="1100-6530626">price increase</a> or a delay.

Eremite Studios and Hooded Horse’s bestest best city-<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-building-games-on-pc">builder</a> <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/against-the-storm">Against The Storm</a> is getting a free update and a new paid expansion, featuring a new biome, mechanics and faction. Details are thin on the ground, but we can safely say that it’ll involve bats. I know: bats! Let the wannabe Hunter S. Thompson write-ups abound. Back in the halycon days of New Games Journalism we’d have had a field day with this. Come now, help me word this introduction more appropriately: “we were somewhere around the Smouldering City, on the edge of the Blightstorm, when the DLC packs began to take hold...”
</p><!--more-->
<p>
Against The Storm’s bats certainly seem to have plenty of fear and loathing. According to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1336490/view/541101973283275149?l=english">the announcement post on Steam</a>, they’re “a stern and fiercely devoted people, taking pride in enduring what breaks others – they do not take failure lightly”. 
</p>
<p>
Bats apparently “excel at metallurgy but find no particular comfort in any specific type of work”. Instead, they get something called Dedication, a passive ability that generates Resolve when members of other species leave or perish. So the more your population suffers and shrinks in Against The Storm, the more zealously your bats will perform.
</p>
<p>
If you’d like to test out the forthcoming additions, Eremite are running an open alpha - find details on how to get involved on Steam. It’ll run for the next 4-6 weeks. There are no dates yet for the final public release of either the free update or the paid DLC, but the post notes that “with this DLC, we’ll complete the species roster we’ve envisioned for the game ever since Bats were first introduced during the community vote a little over two years ago.” Which implies that there won’t be any more factions after the bats.
</p>
<p>
I need to give Against The Storm a proper go. Everybody <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/against-the-storm-review">sings its praises</a>, and I adore the dark fantasy concept, but somehow it hasn’t stuck with me. Perhaps the addition of some nihilistic Draculads will be the charm.

            <p>FromSoftware boss and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/give-us-the-damn-moon-nintendo">treacherous moon denier</a> Hidetaka Miyazaki has emerged from his Nintendo-nuzzling weasel den to reassure the braying masses that FromSoftware's traditional focus on single player games isn't going dodo just because they so happened to announce two <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-co-op-games">co-op</a> games - <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/elden-ring-nightreign">Elden Ring Nightreign</a> and The Duskbloods - in the space of five minutes, then ran away with a bag of money shouting "single player is dead 4eva".

<p>"I’ve always found the PvPvE structure very interesting," Miyazaki told the disembodied spirit of Nintendo in a <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/whatsnew/creators-voice-the-duskbloods-part-1/">recent interview</a>. "It allows for a broad range of game-design ideas, while also letting us leverage our experience of designing challenging enemy encounters".</p>
<p>"As a side note," he continued, briefly interrupted by an audience of PC owners who he quickly fobbed off by pulling off his jumper to reveal a shirt that read 'the moon doesn't exist', "please allow me to address one thing. As previously mentioned, this is an online multiplayer title at its core, but this doesn’t mean that we as a company have decided to shift to a more multiplayer-focused direction with titles going forward. The [Steam Deck for sugar addicts] version of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-boss-locations">Elden Ring</a> was also announced, and we still intend to actively develop single player focused games such as this that embrace our more traditional style".</p>
<p>He then went on to give some details about The Duskbloods, a game that will presumably never exist on PC and therefore deserves not an inch of hallowed RPS column space. It's got vampires in it. One of the vampires has an elephant or something. Not sure. Stopped paying attention. Best of luck to this 'Miyazaki' dude, though. He seems like a sharp one.</p>
<p>A sharp one, too, is our Edwin, who earns his crust by having <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/fromsoftware-multiplayer-is-best-when-its-a-secret">objectively correct takes about FromSoftware's multiplayer</a>. If I'm not traipsing through a mystical forest to murder people for a large, aging cat, I'm not interested. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/best-meta-warzone-verdansk-loadout-for-call-of-duty/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Call of Duty Warzone in 2025 has Verdansk, and the world is a better place for it. The best Meta Loadout in Warzone is the perfect combination of firepower, precision, and fun, and we’ve got it.</p>



<p>Warzone is partying like it’s 2020 again with the reintroduction of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/with-verdansk-return-call-of-dutys-player-count-jumps-200/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Verdansk</a>. Players wanted it for years, the community pleaded, and Activision listened. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/cod-season-03-patch-notes-warzone-black-ops-6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Ops 6 and Warzone 2 Season 3</a> brought back the nuked and nullified map. Veterans are hopping back in, and newbies are jumping into the new <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/what-is-warzone-casual-in-call-of-duty-battle-royale-mode-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Casual Mode</a> before getting the itch for full-scale, human-focused battle royale.</p>



<p>You need the right loadout once you’re ready for Normal and Ranked Warzone in Verdansk. I’m here to drop you our ultimate loadout. Forget multiple variations or options, as this is the best Warzone Meta loadout that should serve you well.</p>







<figure><figcaption>Tried and trusted. Credit to Activision</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>We think the CR-56 AMAX Assault Rifle is unbeatable and the best meta primary weapon to use in Warzone’s Verdansk battle royale.</strong></p>



<p>The AMAX has been a fan-favorite in <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/uk/en/warzone" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Warzone</a> before, and it’s still the same in 2025. Various trackers of Warzone gun data show the AMAX is the most-used gun and (debatably) the most powerful if you have the perfect loadout.</p>



<p>I know you’re here for it, so this is the optimal Warzone CR-56 AMAX Assault Rifle Meta Loadout for Verdansk:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Optic:</strong> Otero Red Dot</li>



<li><strong>Muzzle:</strong> Monolithic Suppressor</li>



<li><strong>Barrel:</strong> Gain-Twist Barrel</li>



<li><strong>Underbarrel:</strong> Vertical Foregrip</li>



<li><strong>Magazine:</strong> Extended Mag II</li>
</ul>



<p>You might need to level up a bit to unlock these attachments, but rest assured, it’s worth it!</p>







<figure><figcaption>Good times are here again. Credit to Activision</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Our secondary weapon of choice is the HDR Sniper Rifle in CoD Warzone.</strong> </p>



<p>The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-get-the-hdr-in-warzone-and-black-ops-6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">HDR</a> is back, and Sniping feels back, and you can one-shot-down players if you’re accurate. The HDR has incredible range, damage, and mobility, and it gives you an option at longer distances. While you can go with something smaller and nimble to assist the AMAX, we feel the AMAX is perfectly viable at close and mid-range.</p>



<p>We want a long-range option, and a one-shot gun at any distance is a no-brainer, so here’s the best loadout:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Muzzle:</strong> Monolithic Suppressor</li>



<li><strong>Barrel:</strong> Gain-Twist Barrel</li>



<li><strong>Stock:</strong> Combat Stock</li>



<li><strong>Rear Grip:</strong> Quickdraw Grip</li>



<li><strong>Fire Mods:</strong> 108MM Suppressed</li>
</ul>







<p><strong>We’ve gone with the Survivor, Quick Fix, and Ghost Perks for our best Warzone Verdansk Meta Loadout.</strong></p>



<p>Here’s a quick list showing our selections:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Perk 1:</strong> Survivor</li>



<li><strong>Perk 2:</strong> Quick Fix</li>



<li><strong>Perk 3:</strong> Ghost</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Survivor </strong>regenerates health quickly, and you revive allies faster. We think this is necessary for either solo or team-based play. We also need ways to survive and tank enemy damage, so Survivor gets the vote here.</p>



<p>For Perk 2, <strong>Quick Fix</strong> gets the nod, and it wasn’t a hard choice. This is another Perk based around health regeneration. Plus, it comes with the huge benefit of <strong>plating up with one hand</strong>—freeing you up.</p>



<p>Finally, the third slot goes to <strong>Ghost</strong>. It’s not quite as powerful as it was in the original Verdansk days, but we need it. As long as you’re on the move, you can’t be detected by UAVs or radar ping technology. Anything keeping us covert is fine by us.</p>







<p><strong><strong>Overkill is our Wildcard pick to equip a primary and secondary weapon.</strong></strong></p>



<p>The only other realistic contender is Gunfighter, but that’s being considerate to its feelings. If we’re being a cold-hearted killer like we want to be in Warzone, go with Overkill.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/nintendo-confirms-the-first-three-gamecube-games-coming-to-nintendo-switch-2-more-to-come-a-bit-later/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nintendo-confirms-the-first-three-gamecube-games-coming-to-nintendo-switch-2-more-to-come-%E2%80%9Ca-bit-later%E2%80%9D.1155540/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/nintendo-confirms-the-first-three-gamecube-games-coming-to-nintendo-switch-2-more-to-come-a-bit-later/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>There have been rumblings about Nintendo eventually making its way to adding GameCube games to the library of classic games and consoles available through its Nintendo Switch Online subscription for <a href="https://wccftech.com/switch-online-n64-datamine-more-games/">a while now</a>.</p>
<p>But that didn't make the reveal that it would actually be happening any less exciting when Nintendo confirmed it during the <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-hands-on-impressions/">Nintendo Switch 2</a> direct on Wednesday. The catch here is that GameCube games are only going to be available to players subscribed to the higher-tier Nintendo Switch Online subscription, which is the NSO + Expansion Pack level, and that these games will be exclusively available to players on Nintendo Switch 2.</p>
<p>So even if you're already subscribed to the Expansion Pack tier, you'll need to run out and grab a Switch 2 if you want to play the classic GameCube games Nintendo is adding. And speaking of those games, as expected, Nintendo isn't just dumping all your favorites at once.</p>
<p>The games will be drip-fed as they have been with every other classic console added to the service, and when the console launches this coming June, only three games will be available on launch day. They are:</p>
<ul>
<li>The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker</li>
<li>Soulcalibur II</li>
<li>F-Zero GX</li>
</ul>
<p>As for what will be coming later on, Nintendo did provide a quick preview during its Wednesday presentation. It was a quick scroll, but we know to expect another seven games, which are:</p>
<ul>
<li>Super Mario Strikers</li>
<li>Fire Emblem: Path of Radiance</li>
<li>Pokémon XD: Gale of Darkness</li>
<li>Super Mario Sunshine</li>
<li>Chibi-Robo: Plug Into Adventure</li>
<li>Luigi's Mansion</li>
<li>Pokémon Colosseum</li>
</ul>
<p>There's no word as to when these games will be added to the library of GameCube games, save for the confirmation during the Treehouse Live event on Thursday that they will arrive "<em>a bit later.</em>"</p>
<p><iframe title="GameChat &amp; Nintendo GameCube - Nintendo Classics – Nintendo Treehouse: Live | Nintendo Switch 2" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CEwM94z2oE0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>While Nintendo has already hit some of the big names with this first batch of 10 games, there are still plenty that fans are waiting with bated breath to hear about, like The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess, Mario Kart: Double Dash, Super Mario Bros Melee, and The Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time, to name a few.</p>
<p>Also, now that we've reached GameCube games, it'll be interesting to see how Nintendo continues to evolve this classic library of games and game consoles. Will we actually get Nintendo Wii games added to this library? How far will Nintendo actually go now that we're solidly in the 2000s and getting closer to modern-day games?</p>
<p>There's a real discussion to be had now as to whether GameCube games are where Nintendo stops. Or maybe we just have to wait for the Nintendo Switch 3 before Nintendo Wii games are far enough behind to be added to this library of classic consoles and games.</p>

            <p>
City-building can be an exhausting affair, once you’ve evolved beyond the initial joy of cottage windows lighting up at night, and start having to deal with things like traffic congestion and rubbish collectors going on strike. As such, it’s nice to play a city builder in which you can rest easy in the knowledge that any urban sprawl you engineer will soon be obliterated. It’s even nicer that said city builder is free. 
</p><!--more-->
<p>
<a href="https://avivlevy.itch.io/before-the-ash">Before The Ash</a> is a hexagonal browser-based <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy</a> sim created for the Godot Wild Jam 79 by Aviv Levy. Said game jam’s theme is “growing”. Another developer might have read the entry requirements and knocked out a game about watering daffodils or inflating kittens, but Levy’s thoughts gravitated instead to one of the most famous natural disasters in history. The city you are building in Before The Ash is Pompeii, the Roman burg that was destroyed by the eruption of Mount Vesuvius in 79 AD.
</p>
<p>
Vesuvius is kind of your co-mayor in Before The Ash. It periodically spews flaming boulders that set terrain tiles alight, with blazes spreading until they encounter water. You can extinguish these with your mouse cursor to extract Faith from your populace, which is spent to acquire building cards. The deployment of said building cards, meanwhile, requires resources generated by existing buildings, such as stone and food.</p>
<p>The flaming boulders may also double as a means of clearing away structures you’d like to replace. After a few minutes of this, you'll wonder how you ever managed without a neighbouring volcano. Still, there’s only so long you can cosy up to ole Mister Vesuv. It’ll eventually blow its top and annihilate the map. Your job is to rack up the highest score possible before it does. 
</p>
<p>
If <em>I</em> were Pompeii’s ruler, and I had clear evidence of impending apocalypse, I would probably think about organising evacuations before I started making plans for new aqueducts. Still, I can’t deny that I enjoy the concept of collaborating with a volcano to tidy away some offensive fishing huts and gentrify the riverside. I’d love the developer to flesh out this idea some more.

          <p>Nintendo Switch 2 preorders, which were due to begin on April 9, are being delayed indefinitely amid the financial uncertainty surrounding <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2025/04/critics-suspect-trumps-weird-tariff-math-came-from-chatbots/">Donald Trump's recent announcement of massive tariffs</a> on most US trading partners.</p>
<p>"Pre-orders for Nintendo Switch 2 in the U.S. will not start April 9, 2025 in order to assess the potential impact of tariffs and evolving market conditions,” Nintendo said in <a href="https://www.polygon.com/nintendo-switch-2/553133/pre-orders-delayed-trump-tariff">a statement cited by Polygon</a>. "Nintendo will update timing at a later date. The launch date of June 5, 2025 is unchanged."</p>
<p>Nintendo announced launch details for the Switch 2 <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/04/nintendo-offers-new-details-on-switch-2-hardware-software/">on Wednesday morning</a>, just hours before <a href="https://www.cnn.com/business/live-news/tariffs-trump-news-04-02-25/index.html">Trump's afternoon "Liberation Day" press conference</a> announcing <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2025/04/03/trump-tariffs-affect-countries-economy/">the biggest increase in import duties in modern US history</a>. Those taxes on practically all goods imported into the United States are set to officially go into effect on April 9, the same day Nintendo had planned to roll out Switch 2 preorders <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/gaming-systems/switch-2/how-to-buy/">for qualified customers</a>.</p>

<p>The delay in the preorder date comes as outspoken gamers online are <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1jq5990/the_prices_for_the_nintendo_switch_2s_first_party/">making plenty</a> of <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/former-nintendo-pr-managers-say-switch-2-and-mario-kart-world-price-backlash-a-true-crisis-moment-for-nintendo">noise</a> over the Switch 2's higher-than-expected $450 price point and over Switch 2 software pricing <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/04/psa-mario-kart-world-is-50-bundled-with-a-switch-2-but-80-by-itself/">falling in the $70 to $80 range</a>. Nintendo's promotional "Treehouse" streams showing Switch 2 gameplay have been <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/ethangach.bsky.social/post/3llym2u63522u">inundated with a nonstop torrent</a> of chatters demanding the company "DROP THE PRICE."</p>
<p>Yet today's announcement suggests that Nintendo might need to "assess" whether even a $450 price is feasible given the additional taxes the company will now have to pay to import systems manufactured in countries like China and Vietnam into the United States. Alternatively, Nintendo could eat the cost of any tariffs and sell its console hardware at a loss, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2012/10/why-nintendo-is-losing-money-on-each-wii-u-launch-unit/">as it has in the past</a>, in an attempt to make that money back in software sales.</p>

                <p>The first box-office numbers for A Minecraft Movie have arrived, with the Warner Bros. video game movie bringing in $10.55 million at the domestic box office for its Thursday previews.</p><p>For comparison, the video game movie Five Nights at Freddy's made $10.3 million in the US for its previews, while The Super Mario Bros.

For its part, Warner Bros. is penciling in a a more conservative projection of $65 million. Some estimates, Variety said, peg A Minecraft Movie at $90 million for its first weekend.</p><p>Another point of comparison is Sonic the Hedgehog 3, which made $60 million in the US for its opening weekend, going on to bring in $236 million stateside and $255 million from international markets for a total of $491 million globally.</p><p>Globally, box-office estimates suggest A Minecraft Movie could make as much as $150 million over its first weekend.

			<p>Eidos Montreal doesn't seem to have given up entirely on the Deus Ex series and has reportedly pitched a new entry in the series to multiple publishers, sadly to no avail.</p>
<p>On the latest episode of the<a href="https://www.youtube.com/@insider_gaming" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Insider Gaming</a> Weekly podcast, it was revealed that, following the cancellation of a new entry in the series, which came as part of <a href="https://wccftech.com/deus-ex-revival-eidos-montreal-canceled-embrace-job-losses/">Embracer's restructuring</a>, the development studio started pitching a new Deus Ex game completely separate from the one that Embracer canceled to multiple publishers to see who would be interested in the game. Sadly, none of the publishers that have been contacted showed an interest, and one in particular said that the series is too niche to do anything with. As Eidos Montreal pitched the game to anyone in the market who would even listen to a game pitch, we shouldn't expect this game to see the light of day anytime soon, if ever.</p>
<p><iframe title="Nintendo Switch 2 Reveal, Battlefield's Battle Royal, And A Game From A Classic Series Being Pitched" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XgveqrF7Sug?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>As things stand, and with publishers being more averse than ever to taking risks, as highlighted by Tom Henderson in the Insider Gaming Weekly podcast above, it looks like Deus Ex Mankind Divided will remain the final entry in the series for a very long time. You can learn more about the game released back in 2016 in Alessio's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/deus-mankind-divided-review-totally-asked/">review.</a></p>
<p><em>Could it be better? Most certainly, as pointed out in the review. But Deus Ex: Mankind Divided is already great as it is, and you would be remiss to leave it hanging in physical (or digital) stores if you care the slightest bit about RPGs with a deep story, lots of choices and a cyberpunk setting.</em></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/us-switch-2-pre-orders-delayed-tariffs<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nintendo has delayed Switch 2 pre-orders in the US owing to President Donald Trump's impending economic tariffs, and the company hasn't yet announced a new date on which you'll be able to pre-order the console.</p>

<p>Confirming the delay in a statement given to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/643483/nintendo-switch-2-preorders-delayed-tariffs" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">G</a><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-preorder-guide-mario-kart-world-bundle/1100-6530531/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">ameSpot</a>, Nintendo media relations VP Eddie Garcia said the previously-announced pre-order date of April 9th would be pushed back "in order to assess the potential impact of tariffs and evolving market conditions".</p>

<p>Garcia said Nintendo will "update timing at a later date", but that the Switch 2's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-release-date" rel="nofollow">release date of June 5th</a> remains unchanged. It's unclear whether the My Nintendo Store pre-order date of May 8th will remain in place at time of writing.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/nintendo-switch-2-pre-orders-delayed-us-tabletop.jpg?itok=6b8lUx8x 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/nintendo-switch-2-pre-orders-delayed-us-tabletop.jpg?itok=Hxxo_cV6 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Pre-orders for the Switch 2 have been delayed in the US.</figcaption></figure><p>Given that Garcia says Nintendo is looking to delay pre-orders due to "evolving market conditions" and that he specifically mentions the tariffs, a potential price change for the Switch 2 in the US isn't out of the realms of possibility.</p>

<p>On Wednesday, Nintendo announced that the Switch 2 would cost $449.99 in the US, with that price rising to $499.99 if you want the console bundled with <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mario-kart-world-switch-2-launch-title" rel="nofollow">launch title&nbsp;<em>Mario Kart World</em></a>.</p>

<p>However, yesterday, US president Donald Trump introduced a <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c1jxrnl9xe2o" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">sweeping range of tariffs</a> aimed at various countries and economic bodies, including the European Union, China, Vietnam, and Cambodia. Other countries, like the UK, Australia, and Brazil, were hit with a baseline tariff of 10%.</p>

<p>Those tariffs will hit Nintendo in some of its key manufacturing centers, which will inevitably cause the company to raise its prices for consumers (since that's <a href="https://time.com/7274160/trump-reciprocal-tariffs-questions-answered-explainer/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">pretty much always</a> what ends up happening when it comes to tariffs).</p>




<p>Nintendo hasn't yet announced that it will delay pre-orders anywhere outside the US, but if you're in one of the countries that's been hardest hit by Trump's tariffs, you may wish to keep a close eye on things in the near future.</p>

<p>In case you missed the announcement, Nintendo officially revealed the Switch 2 earlier this week. It'll come complete with a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-specs-revealed" rel="nofollow">1080p screen, a 4K dock, and 120fps support</a> for some games, and it's launching on June 5th (a date which still appears to be intact around the world). Stay tuned for more.</p>

<p>A new report has revealed that Nintendo has acquired a third anti-Palworld patent, and a fourth one is almost about to be granted.&nbsp;</p>



<p>According to a report by <a href="https://gamesfray.com/nintendo-secures-two-more-anti-palworld-u-s-patents-might-file-multi-patent-u-s-lawsuit-against-pocketpair-in-a-matter-of-months-now/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GamesFray</a>, Nintendo now has three anti-Palworld patents—the first two mentioned in an <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-anti-palworld-patent/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">earlier report</a>. The latest one, 12,246,255, was granted on March 11, 2025. It concerns smooth switching between flying and land traversal objects. Also, Nintendo’s request to interview the patent examiner was approved, and it seems a fourth patent will be granted soon.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-what-do-nintendo-s-anti-palworld-patents-mean-for-pocketpair">What do Nintendo’s Anti-Palworld Patents Mean for Pocketpair</h2>



<p>Nintendo will soon have four anti-Palworld patents in the United States, which could mean a lawsuit could be filed against Pocketpair soon. The latest approved patent was initially filled in September 2022, but Nintendo has made amendments to it over the years, even after Palworld’s launch.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Nintendo’s interview with the USPTO examiner was successful. Out of the 23 patent claims, Nintendo has been able to add additional requirements to independent and dependent claims. It has dropped two claims and made limited changes to a claim. Moreover, Nintendo and the Pokemon Company have added a 24th claim, which talks about interacting with a character that a player either battles with or captures.&nbsp;</p>
