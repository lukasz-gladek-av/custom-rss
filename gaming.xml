            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>

<p>At the time of writing, we're now just a few short weeks away from the launch of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/no-sleep-for-kaname-date-from-ai-the-somnium-files">No Sleep For Kaname Date - From AI: THE SOMNIUM FILES</a> for the Switch and Switch 2 on <strong>25th July 2025</strong>.</p>
<p>It's the third entry in the <strong>AI: THE SOMNIUM FILES</strong> series following the launch of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/ai_the_somnium_files">the original game</a> in 2019 and its direct sequel, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/ai_the_somnium_files_-_nirvana_initiative">nirvanA Initiative</a>, in 2022. The series so far has been met with widespread acclaim, and the developers over at Spike Chunsoft seemingly have no desire to stop anytime soon – happy days for us, then!</p>
<p>This year's new entry puts a lot of the focus back on investigator Kaname Date following fan feedback from nirvanA initiative. It also sees developer Kazuya Yamada take the reigns as director and scenario writer, with veteran Kotaro Uchikoshi serving as series director and scenario supervisor. We recently caught up with both to find out more about the game, their roles in its development, and what kind of wacky dreams they've been having recently...</p>
<hr>
<p><strong>Nintendo Life: How would you define No Sleep For Kaname Date? How does it fit in with the overall story of the series?</strong></p>
<figure><a title="Kaname Date 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/644782d36828c/kaname-date-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Director and scenario writer Kazuya Yamada — <em>Image: Kazuya Yamada</em></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>Kazuya Yamada:</strong> Our mission was to "listen to as many opinions as possible from our fans," and the development team, myself included, has become part of the fan base. In that sense, I think the theme of this project is something like, "Let’s all have a fan appreciation event together." That said, I believe we've created a number of settings that could be used as the series continues. If Uchikoshi-san can make good use of them, I'll feel satisfied.</p>
<p><strong>Kotaro Uchikoshi:</strong> When I first heard from the producer, I remember him saying, "It's going to be something like a companion piece." But in reality, it turned out to be more of a true sequel, so much so that it could have been officially the "3" in the series. That applies not just to the overall game, but also to the storyline as well. I'm sure fans will be satisfied with the game, so please look forward to it!</p>
<p><strong>No Sleep For Kaname Date puts a lot of the focus back on the titular protagonist as a playable character - can you tell us more about the story and how you came up with it?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Yamada:</strong> The story begins when Date, who is once again the protagonist, receives a call from Iris who has been abducted by a UFO. As Date searches for Iris's whereabouts, he comes across a mysterious device with a sign attached to it that reads "Psync me." While investigating, he finds a connection to the place where Iris is being held captive.</p>
<p>The story follows his journey to unravel these mysteries, rescue Iris, and solve the case. The story this time was built around the requirement of "making Date the protagonist." We explored a variety of ideas and, taking Uchikoshi’s feedback into account, made adjustments little by little—like carving a sculpture.</p>

<p><strong>Yamada-san, you have moved into the role of Director for this game. How has this experience been for you, and what support have you received from Uchikoshi-san?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Yamada:</strong> I served as both director and scenario writer, and in a word, it was hell. I was honestly impressed that Uchikoshi-san was able to take on such an outrageous workload. I'm even thinking of putting up a sign in the office that says, "Don't be both director and scenario writer, or it may prove fatal."</p>
<p>Despite his busy schedule, Uchikoshi-san not only pointed out things about the scenario but also gave me suggestions like, "If you do it this way, it'll be more interesting." I'm eternally grateful to him. Of course, I appreciated all of his feedback, but more than that, he also knew exactly how much to praise and flatter me, just the right amount. It really helped me stay sane.</p>
<p><strong>Uchikoshi:</strong> I supervised the plot that Yamada-san wrote. For example, I gave him advice on the AI series setting, such as, "The introduction needs to have more impact, so how about this?", "This part is too similar to the last game. Why not try changing it like this?", "As a mystery, it might be better to make this character less suspicious", "It would be better to deliberately hide this fact", "The story would probably develop better if this character didn't know this", "How about making this character the one who orchestrated a certain event?", "As part of the AI series, there’s a certain essence missing, so it would be best to add this", and so on.</p>
<p><strong>There are three distinct gameplay elements in No Sleep For Kaname Date - Investigate, Somnium, and Escape. How do you find the balance between these to ensure the player is entertained and not overwhelmed?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Yamada:</strong> One of the series's trademarks is that we aim to have just the right amount of confusion, but we were also careful to structure the game so that players can focus on the task at hand, whether it's an Escape or Somnium section, while keeping the information organised and easy to follow. The difficulty has been fine-tuned as well, so whether you're confident or not, you should be able to progress at a level that suits you. (If you set the difficulty to the lowest setting, you should be able to complete it even while drunk.)</p>

<p><strong>You've developed the game for the Switch 2 alongside the Switch - what have you been able to achieve with Nintendo’s new console that wasn't possible on the original Switch?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Yamada:</strong> On the original Nintendo Switch, it was extremely difficult to maintain processing speed, and there were parts we had to give up on. However, with Nintendo Switch 2, the hardware capabilities have simply improved, allowing for smooth performance.<strong><br></strong></p>
<p><strong>Are there any games outside of the AI SOMNIUM series that you've looked to for inspiration for this latest release?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Yamada:</strong> I don't think there's much of a direct influence, but I do think that the <strong>Metal Gear Solid</strong> series, the <strong>SaGa</strong> series, and the <strong>Yakuza</strong> series have influenced my approach to game development and scenario writing. What I think they have in common is their willingness to go beyond expectations and include twists and elements that make you think, "Wait, are they really allowed to do that?"</p>
<p><strong>What kind of feedback have you received from fans of AI SOMNIUM and how has this influenced your approach with this new game?</strong></p>
<figure><a title="Kaname Date 3" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/103d544e5e3a9/kaname-date-3.large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Series director and scenario supervisor Kotaro Uchikoshi — <em>Image: Kotaro Uchikoshi</em></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>Yamada:</strong> We received a range of feedback, from how the characters are handled to the quality of life of the gameplay system. Among these, the most impactful piece was, "I wanted to see more of Date’s exploits." Based on this, Date returned as the protagonist.<strong><br></strong></p>
<p><strong>Uchikoshi-san, I recall you saying that you came up with the story for The nirvanA Initiative from a dream. Have either of you had any further dreams that might have influenced this new game?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Yamada:</strong> I had a dream where I was kidnapped by members of the mafia who make movies as a hobby. I was forced to write a script under 24-hour surveillance and couldn't leave the room until their boss was satisfied. Meanwhile, I watched my wife being seduced right in front of me, and I cried uncontrollably. It was too sad, so I didn't use it as any kind of reference.</p>
<p>The part about being confined and forced to write a script kind of came true later on, so I strongly hope and pray that the latter part never comes true. Every day, I try to do good deeds and build up my karma.<strong><br></strong></p>
<p><strong>Uchikoshi:</strong> Yamada-san wrote the scenario, so it doesn't include any elements from my dreams. However, I once had a dream in which a man with his lower body exposed was lying on his back on a conveyor belt, and the part of him that was erect--let’s call it “D”--was wearing medieval armour. As the conveyor belt moved forward, D swung and mowed down these approaching monsters. If there’s an opportunity, I might use that somewhere.</p>
<p><strong>How many more stories could potentially be told in the AI SOMNIUM series? Do you have an ending in mind at all?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Yamada:</strong> From my perspective, with a work like this one, I can expand the scenario and develop it endlessly if there’s even the slightest chance. So if given the opportunity, I believe it could continue for a long time, just like <strong>The Simpsons</strong>.<strong><br></strong></p>
<p><strong>Uchikoshi:</strong> There are about as many stories to tell as there are in <strong>One Piece</strong>. I'll probably still be writing them by the time the Anunnaki aliens return, so I'd like to think about the ending after that.</p>
<p><strong>Uchikoshi-san, you worked closely with Kazutaka Kodaka on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/hundred_line_-_last_defense_academy">The Hundred Line</a>, and he also has <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/shuten_order">Shuten Order</a> launching later this year too. Do you discuss your individual projects with each other and provide feedback?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Uchikoshi:</strong> We hardly ever talk about individual projects, but every now and then, Kodaka will casually mention an interesting idea for something I'm working on, and I kind of keep those ideas in the back of my mind.<strong><br></strong></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer Eremite Games and publisher Hooded Horse have announced the release date for city builder&nbsp;<em>Against the Storm</em>'s upcoming&nbsp;<em>Nightwatchers&nbsp;</em>DLC, and it's arriving pretty soon.</p>

<p>Per a Steam news post,&nbsp;<em>Nightwatchers&nbsp;</em>launches across all platforms on July 31st. It'll bring a brand new species, two new biomes, and plenty of other features if you decide to pick it up, although it is paid DLC rather than a free update.</p>

<p>The Bats are "a stern and fiercely devoted species with unmatched resilience and exceptional metallurgical skills", according to the two studios, so make sure you're leveraging their unique skills if you decide to play as them.</p>

The Ravine's landscape, in particular, is described as "unforgiving", but you can take advantage of the new Black Market feature to keep your settlement afloat even in this harsh landscape.</p>

<p>In the Bamboo Flats, meanwhile, you'll find a new creature by the name of the Fluffbeak, and you can keep an eye out for its "hunger, thirst, and warmth" to effectively care for it and receive fertilizer to help your soil along in return.</p>

<p>Other new features coming as part of the&nbsp;<em>Nightwatchers&nbsp;</em>DLC include new World Events, which will grant powerful new rewards in turn, as well as new Modifiers, new Legendary Cornerstones, and a ton of other good stuff that should make your&nbsp;<em>Against the Storm&nbsp;</em>experience all the more satisfying.</p>

<p>You can check out the&nbsp;<em>Against the Storm&nbsp;</em><em>Nightwatchers&nbsp;</em>DLC release date trailer, which gives you a sense of what will be in store for you if you decide to grab the expansion, right here.</p>




<p><em>Against the Storm&nbsp;</em>is available right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1336490/Against_the_Storm/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10011016" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/against-the-storm/9nrlrjpv4hwl" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/against-the-storm-switch/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch</a>, and the&nbsp;<em>Nightwatchers&nbsp;</em>DLC will launch on July 31st.

            <p>Big piratey thing <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/sea-of-thieves">Sea of Thieves</a> will be getting custom servers as part of a paid subscription service in "early 2026", developers Rare have announced during a first-ever community direct for the game. That's far from all of the studio's plans, with wider shakeups also in the pipeline.</p>
<p>This outlining of plans to make sure the good ship SOT is not only seaworthy, but can successfully broadside the many other vessels competing for its players' attention comes with some depressing and un-piratey context. It follows Rare being one of the studios affected by <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-layoffs-are-reportedly-underway-with-zenimax-and-king-employees-losing-their-jobs">Microsoft's mass layoffs</a> earlier this month, with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/everwild">Everwild</a> being among the number of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rares-mysterious-nature-sim-everwild-has-been-cancelled-as-part-of-xbox-mass-layoffs-according-to-reports">in-development games cancelled</a> as part of the cuts.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>In the hour-ish of their community direct and accompanying <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1172620/Sea_of_Thieves_2025_Edition/">Steam blog post</a>, Rare acknowledged that they've got some work to do to keep folks invested in the game. "We know we haven’t hit the mark our players were hoping for in terms of game health and performance, especially when it comes to being reactive to cheating and the game experience on PC," they wrote, "We’re also cognisant that we could be more attuned to the desires and experiences of our player base, and we’ll be working hard to remedy this in future."</p>
<p>Cue some changes to how the teams working on SOT are structured, with Rare saying it's expended the team focused on "improving the core playability and stability of the main game". Alongside this, the studio's taking a different approach to how they structure three-month seasons, with new stuff arriving every month so the players always have something fresh to do.</p>

<p>While seasons 17 and 18, both of which were teased here, are coming soon, those custom servers will be arriving early next year. They'll be deployed as part of a new subscription's "premium package", which'll also include other benefits. You'll be able to tweak the seas of your custome server to suit your every whim, spawning enemies, turning off enemies, running safer seas fleets, messing about with the devs' cinematic camera. The place oysters come from is your oyster.</p>
<p>"Although this subscription service is landing next year, we’ve taken the decision to announce it nice and early so that our Partners and creative communities can start making plans sooner rather than later," Rare wrote, "We want to build this toolset in partnership with the community, and running it as a subscription model means that we can ensure ongoing investment into and development of custom servers as a platform."</p>
<p>So, there you go. Sea of Thieves is sailing on. Hoist the mainsail.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/sea-of-thieves-is-getting-paid-custom-servers-next-year-and-rare-are-switching-up-their-approach-to-seasons]]></content:encoded>

<p>The intricacies of dino-bonking appear largely in line with bake-the-potato mechanics in similar <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy</a> management games. You will need to construct and place a nest at a tasteful remove from visitors, with comfort levels sufficient to set the mood for the species in question. Dinosaurs have a fertility level that varies according to age, health, and how recently they've roasted the broomstick. From the looks of it, when they're up for some slophockey they'll go perch on the nest and do saucy toodle-oo noises. Then you just need to find or flash-grow an appropriate mate, and assign a boffin to officiate the Chesterfield rugby. </p>
<p>The result will be an individual with a particular combination of genes and traits, such as faster growth, greater aggression and a need for more living space. As is generally the case in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/jurassic-park">Jurassic Park</a>, you may come to regret letting your terrible lizards have kids. "While fascinating for park guests to behold, introducing juveniles also brings new challenges thanks to their unique social needs, as well as changes to the wider herd dynamic," the developers caution in a press release.</p>
<p>It's hard to get much sense of the possibilities from 90-odd seconds of very restrained and managerial T-reXXX footage, but the hope, of course, is that the system will lead to sudden overpopulation punctuated by a few total genetic disasters. I want to turn my back for five minutes and discover that the triceratops have become the equivalent of parakeets in London, and that all of the young velociraptors are vegetarians. Going by the developer's prior work, I don't think it'll be quite that adventurous, but, as Geoff Goldblum likes to say, life finds a method.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/new-jurassic-world-evolution-3-breeding-trailer-explains-the-fine-art-of-dinosaur-bonestorming]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-callisto-protocol-devs-next-game-codenamed-project-titan-has-seemingly-been-cancelled.1241589/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Project Titan, the codename for the next game from Striking Distance Studios, the studio behind The Callisto Protocol, appears to have been cancelled. </p>



<p>Spotted on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1lwgzeh/titan_project_of_striking_distance_from_the/">Reddit</a>, a senior technical artist at Striking Distance Studios, which was founded by Dead Space creator Glen Schofield as a subsidiary under Krafton, listed Project Titan as a cancelled game that they worked on. They listed their tasks on the project as character, weapon, and prop setup and rigging, which were also tasks they did when working on The Callisto Protocol.</p>



<p>When Striking Distance Studios (SDS) was first announced as a new team with Schofield leading the way, there were a lot of reasons to be excited about the new studio. It was a team of veteran developers, all coming together to leverage what was at the time the next generation of consoles, and though we didn't know it for sure at the time, when <a href="https://wccftech.com/talking-to-glen-schofield-about-striking-distance-cinematic-narrative-experience-set-in-pubg/">Wccftech spoke to Schofield</a> about the "<em>cinematic narrative experience</em>" they were creating at SDS, we could only hope that the team was making a game akin to Dead Space.</p>



<p>Fans of horror games, like myself, got their wish when The Callisto Protocol was revealed. It was billed as a 'spiritual successor' to Dead Space, and with Schofield directly behind the project, it felt like there was potential for a new series of horror games. </p>



<p>Obviously, that is not how things panned out. The Callisto Protocol seemed to have a myriad of issues even in development, as Schofield publicly discussed what appeared to be a pretty<a href="https://wccftech.com/striking-distance-callisto-protocol-crunch/"> awful period of crunch that the team went through.</a> Then, when it arrived, it did so to middling reviews across the board, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-callisto-protocol-break-out-outbreak-break-a-leg/">including from us here at Wccftech</a>.</p>



<p>It didn't help that EA released a <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/dead-space-effective-yet-finite-facelift/">stunning remake of the game that</a>, for all intents and purposes, launched Schofield's career to a new level a month after The Callisto Protocol failed to impress, but the success of EA Motive's Dead Space Remake is hardly what stopped The Callisto Protocol from taking off. Schofield later revealed that <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-callisto-protocol-was-released-too-early-admits-glen-schofield/">the game was launched too early,</a> and that part of the crunch issues the team suffered came from Krafton not giving the team approximately three to four more months to complete their work on the game that they thought they were going to have.</p>



<p>SDS suffered <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-callisto-protocol-dev-striking-distance-layoffs-future-projects/">multiple rounds</a> of <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-callisto-protocol-studio-striking-distance-hit-with-devastating-layoffs/">layoffs</a>, and Schofield ultimately <a href="https://wccftech.com/glen-schofield-leaves-striking-distance-after-the-callisto-protocols-failure/">left the studio</a> less than a year after the game's launch and subsequent failure. Last year, we learned that the team was still <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-callisto-protocol-dev-striking-distance-studios-working-on-a-brand-new-unannounced-unreal-engine-5-title/">working on a new game, </a>which was presumably the now-cancelled Project Titan. It's unfortunate that a team with such high hopes has had such a tragic journey. Hopefully, there's a better chapter to come for the team with their next project, and the next time we hear about Striking Distance Studios isn't to find out that they've been shut down.</p>

More potential followers are rescued by the day, but with no one to indoctrinate them, Lamb’s power stagnates and The One Who Waits becomes weary of his earthly vessel’s resistance to the full power and responsibility of the Red Crown. When famine strikes the cult, a challenger to Lamb’s mantle emerges, and a new struggle begins...</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Let me just clear the air here: I’m not a gamer. At least, I thought I wasn’t until this extraordinary story landed in my lap," Paknadel told IGN about The First Verse. "A perfect innocent – a sacrificial lamb - is given the means to avenge themselves against the tyrannical system that threw them under the bus for a paltry superstition. It’s a classic revenge fantasy, but it also contains the seeds of truly epic tragedy.Get ready to experience the events of the game from the Lamb’s perspective – their fall and rise and fall - and see why the tragedy of The One Who Waits’ anointed avenger only began with their death."</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/10/unnamed16-1752169639896.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Art by Troy Little.

Its combat is immensely satisfying even if its short runs and the relative lack of variety between them doesn’t give it the lasting appeal of other action roguelikes, and building my very own cult base and tending to a flock of followers was just as fun as any swing of the axe.

                <p>The debate over the future of Final Fantasy, namely its approach to combat, continues, and this time the question has been put to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/final-fantasy-xvi/">Final Fantasy XVI</a> producer Naoki 'Yoshi P' Yoshida, who admitted there is no "clear-cut" answer.</p><p dir="ltr">Final Fantasy XVI was a radical departure from previous installments by being a completely real-time action game, even eschewing command menus present in the action-oriented Final Fantasy XV. During an interview at Anime Expo, Yoshida was asked whether the series would return to a turn-based system, given the recent success of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/clair-obscur-expedition-33/">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a>, which was in turn inspired by earlier Final Fantasy games and Persona.</p>

<p dir="ltr">"With this question of turn-based versus action, it tends to isolate the gameplay to just the battle system," Yoshida told <a href="https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/interview/2025-07-08/final-fantasy-xvi-producer-on-the-series-future/.226405" rel="nofollow ">Anime News Network</a>. "That doesn't take into account what kind of game the creators want to deliver to players. For example, based on a certain graphical quality we want to present to our players, or the narrative we want to deliver to our players, it relates to how we set up the game's systems around it. This includes the battle system, game design, and gameplay feel. It's not a clear-cut answer, whether it will become all turn-based, or if it's going to become more action-based."</p><p dir="ltr">Mainline numbered Final Fantasy games also tend to have completely different settings, characters, and gameplay systems, as well as work done on by different teams, with Yoshida emphasizing the latter. "[I'm] not necessarily going to be on Final Fantasy 17, so we also don't want to obstruct or limit our future director or whomever will be producing the games like 17 or even 18. We don't want to put them on a rail."</p><p>Final Fantasy 16 released on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/final-fantasy-7-remake-intergrade-final-fantasy-xvi-finally-coming-to-xbox/1100-6532259/">Xbox Series X|S</a> last month, following its original launch on PS5 in 2023 and then its release on Steam last year. It marks a shift in Square Enix's strategy to move away from console exclusives, with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/videos/final-fantasy-tactics-the-ivalice-chronicles-announcement-trailer/2300-6466048/">Final Fantasy Tactics: Ivalice Chronicles</a> releasing in September for multiple platforms.</p>

<p>Primarily, the unlocked frame rate rarely manages to hit that 60fps sweet spot, resulting in some horrible stuttering that's far more prevalent in docked mode thanks to the VRR technology in handheld mode. Thankfully, developer IO Interactive is aware and is looking to address these issues very soon.</p><div><figure data-videoid="_evSaRNgyaU" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_evSaRNgyaU?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/_evSaRNgyaU?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_evSaRNgyaU?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed5c6dc3htlsyk&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_evSaRNgyaU" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>As reported by <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/io-addresses-hitman-switch-2-performance-issues-and-says-fixes-are-on-the-way/">VGC</a>, IO is hoping to issue a fix for the performance issues "over the Summer". Bit of a vague timescale, we're sure you'll agree, but it gives the dev some wiggle room if it needs a bit of extra time. It didn't elaborate on exactly what the fix would entail, but a spokesperson said that "the team is working on some of those performance issues right now", suggesting that the frame rate issue specifically would be high up on the team's list of priorities.</p>
<p>It also stated that these learnings would be applied to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/007-first-light">007 First Light</a>, which is scheduled to launch on Switch 2 in 2026. The <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/007-first-light-official-game-reveal-launching-on-switch-2-in-2026">official announcement</a> for the game arrived last month, with a full gameplay reveal scheduled to take place this Summer.</p>
<p>Whatever comes from the planned update, we're excited to see what kind of improvements it brings. We don't know about you, but we're eager to dive back into Hitman: World of Assassination. The only thing holding us back right now is that darn frame rate.</p>

It's a bid to address the FOMO element that has dragged the game down to an Overwhelmingly Negative <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2246340/Monster_Hunter_Wilds/">Steam user review consensus</a>, though there are other things to blame for that, such as <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/monster-hunter-wilds-title-update-two-aims-to-defeat-the-biggest-beasts-of-all-shader-compilation-and-vram-issues">dodgy performance</a>.</p><!--more-->
<p>One Arch-tempered munster, Rey Dau, will return on July 23rd, after the currently available event quest ends on July 16th. (If you're unfamiliar, Rey Dau is a big golden Tesla dragon.) Arch-tempered Uth Duna will debut on the same date, a week ahead of schedule. (If you've yet to have the pleasure, Uth Duna is a flouncy alligator that loves to sneeze on itself.)</p>
<p>These may not be the first permanently available Arch-tempered monsters. "We are considering making the event quests for the upcoming Arch-tempered monsters and other event quests permanently available as well," Capcom comment via <a href="https://x.com/monsterhunter/status/1943582546886889868">MechaHitler.com</a>. More details are to follow.</p>
<p>Going by the responses to this announcement, I gather that the limited-time quests in Monster Hunter Wilds have been causing a lot of ruckus. Some players object that the previous major series iteration, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/monster-hunter-rise-sunbreak">Monster Hunter Rise: Sunbreak</a>, did not have these stressful features, while others point out that they were present in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/monster-hunter-world">Monster Hunter: World</a>, the last game from the Wilds team specifically.</p>
<p>My only, rather disingenuous thought here is that it's a bit rich for so-called "hunters" to be complaining of FOMO. Hunting is supposed to be about identifying and accommodating the prey animal's schedule, isn't it? Pretty dang sure the pre-Neolithic tribes weren't out there review-bombing the skygods because the herds kept moving south for the winter. Actually, that probably explains the formation of many organised religions.</p>
<p>I wonder if Capcom have considered just not telling people when Arch-tempered monsters are present in the game. Foster the element of curiosity! I'm sure that would in no way increase the quantity of hatemail they're receiving. Capcom have recently <a href="https://www.capcom.co.jp/support/faq/information_info2025_0266919.html">put out a statement</a> addressing the harassment of staff, which has been widely interpreted as a response to the ruckus over Monster Hunter Wilds.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/latest-monster-hunter-wilds-update-aims-to-rally-the-steam-reviews-and-slay-the-wildest-monster-of-all-fomo]]></content:encoded>

But this needs to be made right.<em> Subnautica </em>has been my life’s work and I would never willingly abandon it or the amazing team that has poured their hearts into it.”</p><p>Unknown Worlds was sold to Krafton in 2022 for roughly $500 million. If the studio hit revenue targets this year, the founders were on track to get an additional $250 million payout, with a percentage of that going to the rank-and-file developers on the studio floor. But delaying<em> Subnautica 2</em>'s Early Access launch to 2026 makes hitting that goal basically impossible. Krafton says it didn’t fire them to avoid the payout, but because the founders failed to deliver a launch-quality version of <em>Subnautica 2</em> as promised. Cleveland, who directed the first game, has for his part clamed the game was ready. </p><p>There are now also alleged leaks of an internal May 2025 milestone review <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://imgur.com/a/lXgAdej&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://imgur.com/a/lXgAdej" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">floating around online</a></span> that paint a messy picture of the game’s development timeline. It includes an assessment that <em>Subnautica 2</em>'s Early Access version was too content-light to “drive IP growth and expansion” and calls for 30 percent more content, including additional biomes, creatures, and narrative chapters. If accurate, it would lend credence to Krafton’s recent claims, though for now the alleged leak remains unsubstantiated. </p><p>This would hardly be the first time that studio founders got into a messy and drawn-out fight with their parent publisher over debates about scope, timelines, and bonus payouts. The most notorious version of that was Infinity Ward leaders Vince Zampella and Jason West’s <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/infinity-ward-founders-suing-activision-over-unpaid-roy-452579213?_gl=1*2f6910*_ga*NjQ4ODc3OTQxLjE3NDgwMDgwOTM.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*czE3NTIyNDA5NjQkbzkkZzEkdDE3NTIyNDMzMTMkajYwJGwwJGgw&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/infinity-ward-founders-suing-activision-over-unpaid-roy-452579213?_gl=1*2f6910*_ga*NjQ4ODc3OTQxLjE3NDgwMDgwOTM.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*czE3NTIyNDA5NjQkbzkkZzEkdDE3NTIyNDMzMTMkajYwJGwwJGgw">high-profile 2010 lawsuit against Activision over <em>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare </em>royalties</a></span>. The litigation went on for two years before it was settled, filled with tons of wild revelations about everything from corporate espionage to Activision’s then-unannounced plans for the first <em>Destiny</em>. </p><p>We’ll see how long this lawsuit lasts and what it eventually reveals. Hopefully, Unknown Worlds’ roughly 100 employees are able to still ship a good game and get what they’re owed in the process. “As for the earnout, the idea that Max, Ted and I wanted to keep it all for ourselves is totally untrue,” Cleveland wrote in his latest update. “I’m in this industry because I love it, not for riches. Historically we’ve always shared our profits with the team and did the same when we sold the studio. You can be damned sure we’ll continue with the earnout/bonus as well. They deserve it for all their incredible work trying to get this great game into your hands.”</p><p>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/subnautica-2-delay-lawsuit-leaks-biomes-steam-krafton-1851786101]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/fbi-seizes-popular-nintendo-switch-rom-site.1241508/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The FBI has seized and taken down one of the more prominent Nintendo Switch ROM sites, Nsw2u. First reported by <a href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-piracy-nsw2u-roms-fbi-hack-emulator-zelda-1851786034">Kotaku</a>, the site was seized earlier this week on Thursday, though according to some of the members of the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SwitchPirates/new/">Switch Piracy Reddit page</a>, the site remained up for a few hours before being entirely taken down. If you try to visit the website now, you'll be met with a splash screen from the FBI notifying that the site has been seized "<em>in accordance with a seizure warrant</em>."</p>



<p>The splash screen also includes a logo from the FIOD Tax Administration, a Dutch agency that was involved in investigating the site and having it taken down. Nintendo has not commented on the takedown, but it's clear that this is a part of the company's more aggressive effort to combat piracy on Nintendo Switch and Switch 2 devices. </p>



<p>Regarding the Nintendo Switch 2, the company's <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-bricked-unatuthorized-use/">ability to brick Switch 2 devices</a> is something that's been widely reported by now, another sign of just how serious Nintendo is about players using their devices in what the company deems to be an "<em>unauthorized</em>" way, even if they are being fought<a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-bricking-nintendo-switch-2-consoles-challenged-in-brazil/"> by regional government agencies</a>. After all, it didn't take very much for players to be able to jailbreak Switch devices at launch. All it took to open the door to a jailbroken Switch was a <a href="https://www.inverse.com/article/44106-nintendo-switch-hack">paper clip,</a> before Nintendo had released revised models of the console to nullify the popular method. </p>



<p>That didn't stop players from jailbreaking the device, however, and the battle against piracy is one Nintendo continues to fight. </p>

But since its global release last month, strong word of mouth, including streams from mainstream creators like Northernlion and Vinesauce, has helped catapult it to widespread attention, where earlier this week it hit its all-time-peak of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/umamusume-pretty-derby-is-galloping-up-the-charts-on-steam/1100-6533094/">just over 50,000 concurrent players on Steam</a>.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uCaWqXP54Mc" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/uCaWqXP54Mc" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>That seems to have also prompted more enquiries from fans who want to actually visit the real-life race horses the titular Umamusume are based on, as a <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/verchan.bsky.social/post/3ltcv7zpzrk2o" rel="nofollow ">BlueSky user</a> has noted that appointments to visit Haru Urara, a race horse beloved for her long losing streak, has already been booked out for the month. Their post also included a screenshot from a Twitter user urging fans to "please be respectful and follow the rules".</p><p dir="ltr">Those rules are now available on the Umamasume: Pretty Derby <a href="https://umamusume.com/visitingstables-guidelines/" rel="nofollow ">website</a>, and they advise prospective visitors to contact the Kyousoba Furusato Information Center rather than the stables directly for a visit. It also warns, "Horses are extremely sensitive to their surroundings. Even what seems like a small change to a person could be a shocking, scary, or stressful event to them. For the safety and well-being of the horses, we ask all Umamusume fans to follow all rules and practice good etiquette when visiting stables in Japan."</p><p dir="ltr">The guidance is only for when visiting stables in Japan, but fans are advised to check local resources for information and rules if they wish to visit stables outside of Japan.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-xvi">Final Fantasy 16</a> producer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/naoki-yoshida">Naoki Yoshida</a> has commented on the possible turn-based future of the series, following the recent success of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/clair-obscur-expedition-33">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a>.</p>
<p>Over the course of the series, Final Fantasy games have moved away from classic turn-based battles and progressed towards the all-action gameplay of 2023's Final Fantasy 16, which disappointed some long-term fans.</p>
<p>By contrast, Sandfall Interactive's Clair Obscur, released earlier this year, features an action twist on turn-based battles and has become something of an exemplary talisman for RPG fans hoping <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a>'s series will return to its roots.</p>

<p>Now, in a recent interview at the Anime Expo 2025, Yoshida (also director and producer of MMORPG <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-xiv-a-realm-reborn">Final Fantasy 14</a>) was asked what the success of Clair Obscur could mean for the future of Final Fantasy.</p>
<p>"With this question of turn-based versus action, it tends to isolate the gameplay to just the battle system," he told <a href="https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/interview/2025-07-08/final-fantasy-xvi-producer-on-the-series-future/.226405">Anime News Network</a>. "That doesn't take into account what kind of game the creators want to deliver to players. For example, based on a certain graphical quality we want to present to our players, or the narrative we want to deliver to our players, it relates to how we set up the game's systems around it. This includes the battle system, game design, and gameplay feel.</p>
<p>"It's not a clear-cut answer, whether it will become all turn-based, or if it's going to become more action-based."</p>
<p>He added: "[I'm] not necessarily going to be on Final Fantasy 17, so we also don't want to obstruct or limit our future director or whomever will be producing the games like 17 or even 18. We don't want to put them on a rail."</p>
<p>While I personally enjoyed the ambitious, cinematic storytelling of Final Fantasy 16 and its Game of Thrones inspired setting, I can understand why some felt its action combat was a big departure from series tradition. Final Fantasy 7 Remake, for instance, more readily blurred the boundary between turn-based and action battles.</p>
<p>Yet when <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-16-has-me-questioning-the-essence-of-the-series">I interviewed Yoshida ahead of Final Fantasy 16's launch</a> about the essence of the series, he responded: "I think, for me, that Final Fantasy is all about making that cinematic experience. You think back all the way to the original Final Fantasy on the original Nintendo Entertainment System, you start out, you play the game a little bit, you get to a certain point, and then you finally get that opening scene. And that truly cinematic experience, it separates itself from other games and makes it like a movie."</p>
<figure>

</figure>
<p>Meanwhile <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-creator-hironobu-sakaguchi-discusses-the-essence-of-the-series">Hironobu Sakaguchi, the creator of the series, stated in an interview with Yoshida</a> at the Final Fantasy 14 Fan Fest in London 2023 that Final Fantasy is all about taking risks.</p>
<p>"I think with Final Fantasy you always want to take a challenge, to take an adventure into building a new system for the new installment, that courage to be able to take that risk," he said.</p>
<p>"Of course it's a very hard job and a very large undertaking, but with a series that has continued for this long sometimes people might think, 'Why don't you just make more of the same thing?'. I think that shouldn't be the case in Final Fantasy."</p>
<p>I agree that what makes the series special is how unique each game is and how daring its developers have been in trying something new with each installment. It's a series about pioneering new ideas, not following trends. I would love to see that continue with Final Fantasy 17.</p>
<figure>

</figure>
<p>A return to the tradition of turn-based battles would look like a step backwards for the series, and a white flag from Square Enix it's resigned to compete with Sandfall (and, really, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/metaphor-refantazio-review">Atlus</a>) in the turn-based stakes instead of looking forward.</p>
<p>Still, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/square-enix-admits-final-fantasy-7-rebirth-and-final-fantasy-16-profits-did-not-meet-expectations">Square Enix admitted sales of both Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth and Final Fantasy 16 "did not meet expectations"</a>, so perhaps it's time for a rethink for the next mainline entry.</p>
<p>What's more, that celebration of tradition certainly worked for Final Fantasy 9. And perhaps that rumoured remake could satisfy long-term fans - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/square-enix-celebrates-final-fantasy-9s-25th-anniversary-so-wheres-the-rumoured-remake">if, in fact, it's ever released</a>.</p>
<p>Until then, Yoshida has assisted with the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/long-rumoured-final-fantasy-tactics-remaster-is-real">forthcoming remaster of Final Fantasy Tactics</a>, that's due out in September. It might also be turn-based, but as a strategy tactics game it's yet another example of the combat variety the Final Fantasy series offers.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/not-a-clear-cut-answer-whether-final-fantasy-17-will-be-turn-based-says-naoki-yoshida-following-clair-obscurs-success]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="body">
<article id="article">
<header><section>
<p>Well, that escalated</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>Repair firm iFixit has performed a full teardown of the Switch 2's Pro Controller, delivering a scathing review of the repairability and potential durability of the accessory. Ultimately, it calls the Pro Controller a "p**s-poor excuse for a controller".</p>
<p>But why? Well, watching the video reveals just how tricky it is to actually get into the Pro Controller, with Nintendo applying adhesives to the front faceplate, lots of hidden screws, and thumb-grips that need "an uncomfortable amount of force to remove". Essentially, iFixit believes that the work required to simply reach the controller's battery for potential replacement is far too difficult for the average consumer.</p>
<p>Then, of course, we have the potential issue of stick drift. iFixit believes the potentiometer stick technology used in the Switch 2's Pro Controller means it will likely still be prone to drifting. That said, it says that the sticks themselves are slightly easier to remove than that of the original Switch Pro Controller.</p>
<p>As for the good news (if you can call it good news), the headphone jack is fully modular and easily removable. In fact, iFixit says that this is probably the only positive that it can muster when it comes to assessing the Pro Controller.</p>
<p>In conclusion, iFixit points to cheaper controllers such as the <a href="https://www.gulikit.com/productinfo/1443193.html">Elves 2 Pro from Gulikit</a> as accessories that accomplish much more at a lower price, including the additions of TMR and Hall Effect sticks.</p>
<p>Now, in practice, the Pro Controller for the Switch 2 is astoundingly comfortable to use, with excellent-feeling sticks and a strong d-pad. However, as time goes on and more folks find the need to repair their controllers, it seems Nintendo has made it about as difficult as possible to actually get into the bloomin' things.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Just over 3 years ago, we reviewed the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/bushido-two-player-starter-set-review" rel="nofollow">current 2-player starter set</a> for <em>Bushido</em> Risen Sun. That set introduced 2 rival families, which could be included as ronin across all factions. Civil Hands Unclean, which adds new ronin sent in support of the families, is releasing soon as an expansion to the 2-player starter set. In this article, we'll have a look at the new fighters and which factions can use them. We also have a preview of an upcoming card that's currently in playtesting at the end of the review.</p>

<p>We've been covering <em>Bushido&nbsp;</em>for years, so if you'd like to learn more about the game, check out <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/guides/bushido-risen-sun-guide" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">our guide to <em>Bushido Risen Sun</em></a>, our <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/bushido-two-player-starter-set-review" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">review of the <em>Bushido Risen Sun</em>&nbsp;2-player starter set</a>, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/features/start-collecting-bushido-risen-sun-part-1-introduction-and-developer-interview" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">our "Start Collecting" guide to <em>Bushido</em></a>, which includes an interview with the game's developer.</p>

<p>In the <em>Bushido</em> 2-Player Starter Set, the&nbsp;Hozumi and the Kiyozumi family are at war, framed by the Romeo and Juliet love story of Koga and&nbsp;Hinadori. Civil Hands Unclean is a 2-Player Starter Set Expansion, and while the <em>Bushido</em> 2PSS isn't required to use this product (the minitures it contains are Ronin and can be used by a variety of factions), it continues the story, and the contents add directly to the original box, taking both forces up to the full 100-rice warbands.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/bushido-civil-hands-unclean-2.jpg?itok=bEOTaQqx 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/bushido-civil-hands-unclean-2.jpg?itok=foeJViio 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The <em>Bushido</em> Civil Hands Unclear 2-Player Starter Set Expansion adds new fighters to both families.</figcaption></figure><h2>Old Reinforcements</h2>

<p>Hozumi Daihanji, the senior Hozumi, has called on warriors from his past to assist in the feud. The first of these is Gocho, a battle-tested warrior, summoned back from retirement. While not a dangerous fighter, Gocho does well in groups of Ashigaru, with a ki feat that can grant other ashigaru within its aura a fear stat equal to the number of friendly ashigaru within it, and while Gocho has a Frightened marker, which his steadfast trait negates a lot of, other friendly ashigaru gain fearless.</p>

<p>Gocho can join Prefecture of Ryu, Minimoto, and Shiho warbands, and his Permission to Speak unique effect means that he can be included in themes for those warbands as if he were friendly ashigaru.</p>

<p>The second fighter Daihanji summoned is a former bandit leader who, after being defeated, swore to aid Daihanji when needed. Tozoku has some history with&nbsp;Kenmeina from the opposing family, which is demonstrated through the Hatred trait. In offence, Tozoku has a Bandit Blade ki feat that can remove enemy dice from a melee exchange, with the option for your opponent to transfer ki to Tozoku to keep the dice.</p>

<p>Tozoku also comes with a Hozumi Introduction enhancement that can be purchased, allowing them and other Hozumi models to be included in themes as if they were faction models. Tozoku can be taken by Ito, Silvermoon, Descencion, Jung, and Shiho warbands.</p>

<p>To aid their cause,&nbsp;Kiyozumi Sadaka has called upon a distant cousin from the great Ito clan, Ito Saiaku. Although Ito in name, Saiaku's profile is a ronin profile, and they deploy with their 2 servants. Saiaku is an interesting unit. He can sacrifice either of the 2 servants to prevent damage and has a melee of 3 with Prowess (1), which allows him to reroll a dice during the exchange. He has to use fortune each turn, which is a coin flip to gain 2 or zero ki a turn. Saiaku and the 2 servants must also use leech each turn, which they can't do off each other, so you'll need to keep other fighters nearby, or risk them all gaining control markers and your opponent getting an action out of each of them.</p>

<p>Saiaku does have some solid ki feats, including a once per game that can stop your opponent outright winning the tactical roll that turn and also negating the tactician trait from the unit using it for the rest of the game. An aura ki feat that increases the cost of ki feats and ki boosts from all units within the aura by 1, and my favorite, Inflated Reputation, which gives Saiaku Fear (6) until the end of the turn, unless he has 3 marked wound boxes, as his facade fails.</p>

<p>Saiaku can also have any number of Enhancement - Equipment cards, and one of the servants, Tahei, has a ki feat that can add any permitted Ronin Enhancement - Equipment card to Saiaku. If this ability isn't used each turn, Saiaku and both servants are removed from play. So you will want to bring a stock of permitted equipment cards to throw on Saiaku throughout the game, gaining him more abilities with each turn, along with making sure Tahei has ki to spend and is nearby Saiaku to use it.</p>

<p>Ito Saiaku comes with the permanent unique effect of allowing themselves and Kiyozumi models to be taken in themes as if they were faction models, and can be taken as standard by the Cult of Yurei, Ito Clan, Silvermoon Syndicate, and the Shiho Clan.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/bushido-civil-hands-unclean-5.jpg?itok=0sBSswhf 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/bushido-civil-hands-unclean-5.jpg?itok=4MayuTFI 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Ito Saiaku drags his 2 servants, Tahei and Matashichi in support of the Kiyozumi clan in <em>Bushido</em> Civil Hands Unclean.</figcaption></figure><h2>Witches Boon</h2>

<p>GCT Studios have kindly offered us a preview of an upcoming card for the next cycle deck that's currently undergoing playtesting, so is subject to change:</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Jade Witch</strong> <em>Enhancement</em></p>

<p>When the Attached model Targets a Soulless model with a Ki Feat, the Ki Feat loses {Opposed Ki}.</p>

<p>When the Attached model performs a Simple Ki Feat Action, this model gains a Spell Token.</p>

<p>The Attached model may remove 2 Spell Tokens to gain a third Activation Counter that turn but it must perform a Simple Ki Feat Action during that Activation.</p>

<p>For effects that count number of Shisai, this model counts as 2 Shisai. (it does not count as 2 models for any other purpose).</p>

<p>Requirement [Ayako] Rice Cost: 1 Max: 1</p>

<p><em>A messiah may draw the attention of the people, but the priestess has the notice of the kami.</em></p>
</blockquote>

<p>This enhancement card, for the Ito Clan, means that Ayako's ki feats all become regular tests against soulless models, rather than opposed tests. All 3 of her ki feats are also simple, meaning that she can essentially use 2 ki feats a turn and still take another action. The final part of the enhancement, making Ayako count as 2 Shisai, means that for her own unique ability, she grants herself Resistance (2) and Willpower (2), giving her an advantage of opposed ki tests.</p>

<p>GCT will be revealing more cards from the upcoming cycle as it approaches release.</p>

<p>Civil Hands Unclean includes some incredibly thematic new units that play into their lore very well. It expands the <em>Bushido</em> 2-Player Starter Set perfectly and adds interesting dynamics to the game. Not all factions can use the units in this set, Savage Wage, Shadow Wind, Temple of Ro-Kan, The Awoken and&nbsp;Kinshi Temple are locked out, but if you have the 2-Player Starter Set, you can build 2 100-rice warbands under the Kiyozumi and Hozumi themes, and add these units to any factions that allow their use.</p>

<p>The <em>Bushido</em> Civil Hands Unclean 2-Player Starter Set Expansion will be available soon as a Retailer exclusive.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>No one knows how it started, but everyone knows that they are here. The Savage Wave of oni, demons from myth and legend, and waves of goblins, has descended on the Jwar Isles. Before they fully become oni, there is a rite of passage, and the onisho need to pass through the ring of fire to prove their worth or perish in the attempt. You might think that not being full oni means they're not as powerful, their rage not as all-consuming. You would be wrong. In this article, we'll have a look at the new Ring of Fire themed warband for the Savage Wave. We'll talk about the new and returning fighters, and where you can go next.</p>

<p>When selecting a warband in <em>Bushido</em>, you must first choose a faction from the 13 available to select your fighters from. Each faction also has access to theme cards, which offer special abilities but restrict the units that can be included in the warband. The Savage Wave is a faction for <em>Bushido</em>, and The Ring of Fire is a theme card that restricts you to onisho, but gives them some incredible benefits that play into their theme.</p>

<p>Using the theme, all friendly onisho gain the last stand trait, which means that if they're reduced to 0 wounds, they're not removed from the battlefield until the end of the turn. Normally, units with last stand can't heal, but onisho can still heal using their consume soul or soul thirst abilities. For every onisho that's removed from play during a game, when an onisho uses oni rage, consume soul, or soul thirst, they gain ki and heal an amount equal to the number of friendly units removed so far.</p>

<p>The Ring of Fire themed warband includes 5 onisho for the Savage Wave, 3 new models, and 2 returning models with updated sculpts. All of the onisho here have the consume soul ki feat, which is a once-per-turn instant use, that allows them to heal wounds equal to the ki stat of an enemy model removed from play within 3 inches of them.</p>

<p>The Ring of Fire theme is led by Junec, who comes armed with Brutal (1), +2 damage swords, along with armor 2 and tough 1, making them difficult to damage, and even more difficult to remove with their healing through enemy removal and last stand ability with the theme. They also have ki feats that let them use banzai to charge for 1 activation (rather than 2), and add +1 to their brutal trait.</p>

<p>Backing up Junec are Jokash and Kuroko. Jokash comes armed with the pole-armed style agoniser, which is only +1 damage (most of the onisho have +2 damage weapons), but it does have reach to allow them to go first in combat if they're not in base-to-base contact. Their indomitable trait means they ignore small and tiny enemy models they're engaged with for penalties and have their melee stat ki boost reduced by the number of them they're engaged with. With armor 3 and tough 1, throwing them into hordes of smaller enemies only benefits them.</p>

<p>Kuroko is armed with a +2 damage ranged arbalest to hit targets you can't reach in melee. The onisho don't benefit from killing targets at range, and with reload 1 and 2 ammo (which can be replenished by taking no actions for a turn), you will want to throw Kuroko into the fray and use the arbalest stock in melee, unless you need to use the arblast to get past armored and tough foes.</p>

<p>Boba and Kano are two older sculpts who have received updated models and retained the same stat cards. Boba likes to throw +2 damage iron skulls, with ki feats to increase the attack range and gain rapid fire 2. Kano likes to dish out stunned markers with their batter ki feat and +2 damage club.</p>

<p>The rice cost of the included onisho in Ring of Fire is 87, and you can easily make up the rest of the 100-point rice cost with the 17 enhancement and event cards included in the set. Each fighter has a unique card enhancement for them, and the rest are generic enhancements or events. My favorite is the There Can Be Only One event, which means that if there is only 1 friendly onisho remaining, it doesn't remove activation counters while enemy units have activation counters, so they can continue to activate multiple times until your opponent finishes their activations. You're going to be extremely aggressive with your onisho, so it's a great just-in-case card to mean you can dish out some insane damage in a phase where you only have 1 onisho left, especially when combined with the last stand ability.</p>

<p>The Ring of Fire theme is extremely aggressive, allowing you to throw your fighters into combat, knowing that they can heal and are difficult to remove because of layers of armor and tough. They have abilities that allow them to come out on top in combat and deal massive damage when they do. The themed last stand ability means that even if your opponent takes them out, they're still dangerous until the end of the turn, and can still heal and keep going.</p>

<p>On top of the previous 2 onisho who've had updated sculps for this pack, 3 other onisho are available, and another is releasing alongside The Ring of Fire. Goro is a huge onisho, on par with Junec in damage-dealing terms. Tsuta and Yasei are slightly cheaper onisho, with Tsuta having ranged options and the only support ki feat out of the whole group with Idolize that can boost another onisho's melee pool. Yasei deals damage with only their fists, with +2 damage wrestling, and a unique ability that always adds another wound to damage rolls in melee.</p>

<p>Releasing alongside The Ring of Fire is Merlek, an onisho shugenja, or magic user. They still have a +2 damage staff, but also a short-range black magic attack that increases in damage for each enemy they damage. They have a Fall into the Ring ki feat, which gives all oni and onisho in the aura strong, making damage tests easier, and all other models in the aura weak, making damage tests more difficult for them. They also have the most thematic of ki feats for the warband, Ring of Fire, which puts a 4-inch aura in the centre of the battlefield, and units within it can't allocate dice to defense.</p>

<p>This is my first experience with the Savage Wave, and they do exactly as you would expect. There's something freeing about throwing your fighters entirely into combat, knowing that your opponent will be on the defensive, and even if they're not, they will struggle to even damage your fighters and, almost impossible to remove them. I love the fact that there is also always the risk of you dropping There Can Be Only One when you've only one fighter left, for an insane final turn with your fighter rushing to deal as much damage as possible while your opponent tries to avoid them. Someone said something about victory points, but I was too busy smashing their forces into the dirt.&nbsp;</p>
