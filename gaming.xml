            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Amidst the craze of <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-game-awards-2025-nominees-full-list/">The Game Awards 2025 nominees</a> being announced, Microsoft and Xbox revealed that it is hosting an Xbox Partner Preview later this week on November 20, 2025. The show will feature games from Xbox's third-party partners, including IO Interactive <a href="https://wccftech.com/007-first-light-release-date-march-2026-james-bond/">showing off more of 007 First Light</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/reanimal-gamescom-preview-a-nightmare-of-a-different-kind/">Tarsier Studios showing off more of Reanimal.</a></p>



<p>The preview event will take place at 10am PT / 1pm ET / 6pm BT on Thursday, November 20, and you'll be able to watch it live on YouTube, Twitch, and TikTok, though Xbox doesn't say how long it will be.</p>



<p>"<em>We’re excited to reveal that the next Xbox Partner Preview – our broadcast that shines a light on upcoming games from our talented third-party partners – is coming this Thursday, November 20,</em>" <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/11/17/xbox-partner-preview-november-2025-announce/?ocid=Evergreen_soc_omc_xbo_tw_Photo_lrn_11.17.1">a post on Xbox Wire reads</a>. "<em>This show will include news on upcoming games from partners including IO Interactive, Tencent and THQ Nordic, plus some brand-new reveals and Game Pass announcements</em>."</p>



<p>We know that both 007 First Light and Reanimal are aiming to release sometime in 2026, <a href="https://wccftech.com/tarsier-studios-reanimal-release-date-q1-2026/">the latter of which is still missing a specific release date</a>. So it's probably safe to say we won't be hearing about games that are going to hit shelves before the end of this year, with this preview event focused more on games arriving in 2026, more specifically, the first half of 2026.</p>



<p>Tides of Annihilation getting a mention in the Xbox Wire post is interesting, since we've not seen much of that game <a href="https://wccftech.com/tides-of-annihilation-qa-2026-tentative-launch-30-hours-light-rpg-elements-exclusive-screens/">since earlier this year when Wccftech spoke to the development team</a>. Perhaps we'll finally learn of the game's release date in this showcase. Overall, hopefully the show has one or two interesting announcements for those tuning in.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A moment many fans have been waiting for is almost here as <em>The Mighty Nein</em>, Critical Role's second campaign, makes its way to Prime Video. Ahead of its release, we got to watch the season and see how <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="a49b5305-f71e-4b04-a989-6db6823aa8cc" href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/interviews/critical-role-and-legend-of-vox-machina-s3-cast-discuss-changing-story" rel="nofollow">Critical Role's second campaign</a> has been adapted to streaming services, how the titular Mighty Nein have come together, and how the campaign has been reshaped to best fit its new format.</p>

<h2>Forming The Mighty Nein And A World On The Edge</h2>

<p><em>The Mighty Nein</em> starts with a bang as the Luxon Beacon is stolen. The Luxon Beacon is an object of great importance to the Kryn Dynasty, not just because of it's power or use in religious ceremony, but it is a relic integral to the cycle of rebirth that is a core aspect of their society.</p>

<p>These first five minutes are the perfect hook, demonstrating not only the importance of the item, but also the skill that the strange thieves with tattooed arms and powerful magical abilities are required to possess to get away with this heist, and why it's disappearance is about to trigger a war that our heroes will very quickly find themselves embroiled with.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-mighty-nein-season-1-magic.jpg?itok=ixrud_Ym 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-mighty-nein-season-1-magic.jpg?itok=sq8TvAjc 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Wizards in The Mighty Nein crafting sigils is one of the best demonstrations of magic I've seen in animation</figcaption></figure><p>It was fascinating watching a wordless sequence filled with a variety of magical abilities and spells cast, every one an easter egg for Critical Role and Dungeons &amp; Dragons in general, as wizards weave signs in midair to cast silence or trigger magical explosions.</p>

<p>The opening three episodes serve as the uniting of the party, we get to meet Caleb and Nott - one searching for magical components to find a familiar and the other searching for a way to keep their bottle filled - Fjord is tasked to protect Jester as she needs to escape Nicodranis, Beau is investigating an attack on the Cobalt Soul, and Mollymauk is already present at the circus that brings them all together.</p>

<p>The character's look and aesthetics are perfect from the get-go. After looking forward to seeing Caleb, Beau, Jester, and more all animated the team at Titmouse have absolutely nailed it. That being said even faithful character designs can't save the first three episodes from being the worst that the season has to offer.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-mighty-nein-season-1-caleb-and-nott.jpg?itok=48UG3SKR 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-mighty-nein-season-1-caleb-and-nott.jpg?itok=j1zaowzg 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Early on, we're getting introduced to four or five different groups or characters while also routinely visiting in on the political discussions of the Kryn Dynasty and of the other major players like Trent Ikithon as everything is being angled together. It robs us of getting a chance to really get to know much about the team, but it does begin the slow feed of information into the backstories of the Nein and how they all will lead them back to the Beacon.</p>

<p>It's an interesting juxtaposition from <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="8fba9665-9011-4fc8-bf7e-3873de998554" href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/legend-of-vox-machina-season-2-review" rel="nofollow"><em>The Legend Of Vox Machina</em></a> which started with the party already (in)famous, and how they rose to greatness. Here we get to see the origins of the Nein before they came together, including their back stories and plenty of additional information that would only be revealed far later in the campaign.</p>

<h2>Early Adventures</h2>

<p>After those first three episodes, the party is together, and this is where the story really takes off. The focus of this initial season is on the party getting together, establishing Trent as a big-bad of the series, and telegraphing some major moments to be coming to Season 2.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-mighty-nein-season-1-caleb-and-frumpkin.jpg?itok=X3XrWXAS 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-mighty-nein-season-1-caleb-and-frumpkin.jpg?itok=C2nPjg2p 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Fans of Caleb will be happy to hear that him and his relationship with the Volstruckers is a key aspect of this first season. Unlike the campaign, where this information is dripfed over months worth of gameplay in <em>The Mighty Nein</em> we get to really revel in it all.</p>

<p>It was incredible to see so many detailed secrets from Caleb's past laid out, this structural change does leave other characters on the sideline, but does a fantastic job to really focus on what makes Caleb the damaged fire wizard that we all know and love him as.</p>

<h2>Changes From Critical Role Campaign 2</h2>

<p>The biggest change that will disappoint people, is just how little Ashley Johnson's Yasha is in this season. We get brief flashes of her across different episodes, and one deep action sequence, but unfortunately aside from that she's primarily absent.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-mighty-nein-season-1-beau.jpg?itok=DCS8-dTt 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-mighty-nein-season-1-beau.jpg?itok=K3AqYUmq 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Where Caleb's back story gets explored earlier, Yasha was even removed from the Circus where she was originally found to better set her up for her role in later seasons.</p>

<p>While I won't spoil them a number of the other major changes are partial retcons of moments in the original adventure that can now be filled in with different elements of the extended Exandria lore that has been further developed through future Campaigns and One-Shots. If you were a fan of seeing Xerxes in<em> <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="42a53bd9-3ace-4e7e-b9b3-8cb0409963bc" href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/legend-of-vox-machina-season-3-review-darker-season-of-dd-twists" rel="nofollow">Vox Machina</a></em>, then you'll have a few massive treats to look forward to in this.</p>

<h2>Easter Eggs In Blink And You'll Miss Them Moments</h2>

<p>Fans of Critical Role will want to keep a very close eye on the different scenes as there's all manner of easter eggs and references that will pop up in the background. It's a fun reward and hat tip to those who are watching <em>The Mighty Nein</em> after consuming <em>Vox Machina </em>or the Actual Play. It also gives the show a unique sense of rewatchability as you'll get to see the story for the first time to enjoy a story about found family and magical hijinx, and then rewatch it to spot some kind of delicious-looking dust in the background.</p>

<p><em>The Mighty Nein</em> Season 1 is everything that I hoped that it would be and more. Even after a slow initial group of episodes once the party is together they absolutely hit the ground running.</p>

<p>While you might find a lot different in the plot, in focusing on specific characters or revealing story elements far earlier than you might expect, it's all been very smartly reformatted to a season's worth of TV.</p>

<p>As with every season of Critical Role's TV shows, now the worst part is waiting for more to release. With Season 4 of The Legend of Vox Machina releasing next year at least there's not too long to wait for that.</p>

        <p>In this games industry? Who's surprised</p>

    </div>


  

    

</header>
  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
It's been a while since Yoko Taro has made a game, hasn't it? That last public (key word here) thing he worked on was a mobile game about how Sega controls pretty much everything called 404 Game Re:set in 2023 (it shut down in 2024). Before that was a trio of Voice of Cards games in 2021/22, and before that the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/nier-replicant">Nier Replicant</a> not-quite-a-remake and also now defunct mobile game <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/nier-reincarnation">Nier Reincarnation</a>. In terms of the big thing that everyone wants, a non-gacha <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/nier">Nier</a> game, things have been very quiet, but that can be said of Taro's work as a whole. Apparently, though, that's not for lack of trying.
</p>
<p>
The developer recently made an appearance at Korean video game convention G-CON 2025, where alongside <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/bayonetta">Bayonetta</a> director Hideki Kamiya he spoke of his approach to game design (via <a href="https://www.4gamer.net/games/991/G999110/20251114049/">4Gamer</a>, translations by <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/nier-automata-creator-yoko-taro-says-hes-actually-been-working-on-a-lot-of-projects-recently-its-just-that-they-got-cancelled-midway/">Automaton</a>). On the topic of this idea that he's not working right now, Taro had this to say: "I often get told stuff like ‘Why aren’t you making a new sequel to NieR’ or ‘Yoko Taro isn’t doing anything,’ but that’s because recently, a lot of projects I was involved in got discontinued midway through development." Ah. That's a tad awkward, and upsettingly common.
</p>
<p>
"I’ve actually been working on some stuff, it’s just that it never ended up seeing the light of day," Taro continued. "I got paid for it, so I personally have no issues with that, but people seem to think that I haven’t been doing anything just because none of the work I’ve done is being released."
</p>
<p>
I would like to be very clear here that I have no idea what Taro may have been working on, and what the status of a hypothetical Nier game might currently be. But, if you're the kind of person that likes to have a moan at game devs on Vitter, maybe cut Taro some slack. And maybe do that for literally everyone, actually.

		<p>I write this from a hotel across the street from the local Buffalo airport a few hours before my flight. The last 36 hours have a whirlwind of breweries, terrific conversations, too much light beer, learning local football cultural customs, and so much more. It has been a delight. Buffalo, <em>thank you</em>. I'm sorry that our meetup didn't come together sooner, which I know meant some folks couldn't make it because the plans were solidified late. (We even had to move the venue last second, because it could not accommodate everyone who was coming, and some folks slipped through the cracks that way, despite my best efforts.) In truth, this trip wasn't going to happen. I didn't think Rob could make it for personal reasons, the government shutdown was making air travel increasingly hairy, and so I figured: well, maybe next year. While the planning could have been tighter, I'm so glad we pulled it off anyway, because I can absolutely <em>guarantee</em> you that we're going to do more of this in the future. </p><p>P.S. We talked about going to Philly next fall. </p><hr><figure></figure><ul><li><strong>PODCAST:</strong> <em>Sports!</em> – I brought my recorder for interviews with me, and along the way, recorded a few brief travelogue entries about my (short) time in Buffalo, alongside an hourlong conversation with Rob after the game was over.</li><li><strong>STREAM: </strong><em>RV There Yet?</em> – Look, Danika and I had so much fun that it's time to get an even bigger group going in this game. Current plan is me, Danika, Rob, and Chia. Danika didn't have to deal with the nightmare that is piloting that RV, so I am very much looking forward to Rob and Chia getting upset.</li><li><strong>PODCAST:</strong> <em>Remap Radio</em> – God willing, all of us will be back together again.

            <title><![CDATA[New Survey Says Most Players Around The World Prefer Single-Player Games]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/new-survey-most-players-around-world-prefer-singleplayer-games-solo-2000644895</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/new-survey-says-most-players-around-the-world-prefer-single-player-games.1356211/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Data from a new global survey involving over 30,000 gamers spread across 20+ markets shows that, overall, people who play games prefer single-player over multiplayer. However, digging into the data reveals some interesting differences between countries like Germany and China, as well as how age plays a factor.</p> <p>On November 17, Ampere Analysis published the results of a large-scale video game survey focusing on <a href="https://kotaku.com/look-single-player-people-are-just-better-5826946">single-player vs. multiplayer games</a>. The research and marketing firm asked 34,428 people who have played a video game in the last year if they agreed with this statement: “I prefer single-player games over multiplayer games.” And the newly released data shows that gamers in most countries do.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000644930" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000644930"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000644930">©Ampere Analysis</figcaption></figure> <p>In the United States, Ampere’s data revealed that 65 percent of gamers prefer single-player, making it the country with the highest number of solo-leaning players. Right behind the United States is Japan at 63 percent, Thailand at 62 percent, and Germany at 60 percent. Meanwhile, a slightly lower number of United Kingdom gamers, 58 percent, prefer single-player over online gaming.</p>

 <p>Interestingly, China and Sweden are the two countries that don’t prefer single-player, according to this survey. 47 percent of players in China and 49 percent in Sweden prefer single-player, meaning more than half would rather log on and play with friends or randos.</p>

 <h2>Multiplayer is more popular with younger gamers</h2> <p>Digging into the data more, Ampere says that gender didn’t play much of a factor, with 55 percent of men and women preferring single-player over multiplayer. On the other hand, age did play a major factor in the survey.</p> <p>According to the firm’s data, only 49 percent of 16-to 24-year-olds prefer playing by themselves. Preference for single-player adventures jumps up to 56 percent when you reach the 25-to-34-year-old range. Meanwhile, 64 percent of gamers aged 55 or older prefer single-player titles.</p>

 <p>This isn’t very shocking to hear, as free games like <a href="https://kotaku.com/old-games-2023-playtime-data-fortnite-roblox-minecraft-1851382474"><em>Roblox </em>and <em>Fortnite</em> have become extremely popular</a> with <a href="https://kotaku.com/pc-gaming-newzoo-balatro-helldivers-2-gdc-time-spent-1851771352">kids and teens who might not be able to afford playing $70+ single-player games</a>. They also likely have more free time to coordinate online sessions with pals, whereas anyone over the age of 30 will be able to share stories of how damn hard it is to get a few friends online to play anything.</p> <p>One thing to keep in mind: Just because this survey and <a href="https://kotaku.com/survey-data-study-53-percent-gamers-singleplayer-pvp-1851665722">others show that a lot of gamers want single-player games</a>, that doesn’t mean publishers are going to stop making live-service titles. The reality is that publishers want to nickel and dime people with one game rather than make a few very expensive single-player adventures that could flop and can’t support years of seasonal updates and battle passes.</p>

<h2 id="h-what-s-new-in-assassin-s-creed-mirage-title-update-1-1-0-valley-of-mirage-dlc">What’s New in Assassin’s Creed Mirage Title Update 1.1.0 Valley of Mirage DLC</h2>



<h3 id="h-new-free-content">New Free Content</h3>



<p>Assassin’s Creed Mirage Valley of Memory DLC comes as a free update for all players, taking them on a new adventure with Basim. Basim has heard something about his long-lost father still being alive, and chasing these rumours, he has reached the new region, AlUla, “a land of secrets, ancient ruins, and vibrant oases. Players will have to complete the “Head of the Snake” mission to access this content. New game players have the option to skip ahead in the story directly through the main menu. </p>



<p>The region of AlUla will feature hours of content that players can explore, including new and returning world activities, family-friendly side activities, world events, work contracts, and brand-new additions. Some of these additions have been named, including Stolen Goods and Oud Melodies, the first mission asks you to stal maps from robbers and the second has players collect musical scenes through parkour sequences. </p>



<h3 id="h-gameplay-improvements">Gameplay Improvements</h3>



<p>As mentioned above, players will observe some significant gameplay improvements in Assassin’s Creed Mirage after title update 1.1.0. Firstly, the free jump option has been included, allowing players to jump manually by pressing a button. Side and back ejects can now be performed even when Basim has no clear area to land on or has a handhold. The “Free” mode can be toggled on/off, and “Safe” mode can be used if you prefer safe and sound landings for Basim. </p>



<p>The Assassin’s Creed Mirage Valley of Memory DLC update will also introduce replayable missions, known as Animus Sequences. These missions will present new challenges that can be completed for rewards, including Animus Mods. These mods are essential auto-refills for your tools and resources, which can only be used in this mode or New Game+. </p>



<p>Two new difficulties have also been added: Hardened Assassin, which comes between Assassin (Normal) and Master Assassin (Hard). Ultra Hardened is the new hardest difficulty, and there is also a new Custom Difficulty preset for a more tailored experience. The DLC also adds a tier 3 tool upgrade, with Throwing Knives becoming explosive, Smoke Bomb becoming corrosive and disolving dead enemies, Blow Darts piercing through heavily armored enemies, Noiskmakes putting enemies to sleep in the impact zone, and Traps can make enemies attack their fellow guards. </p>



<p>There are additional improvements, additions, which you can check out in the full patch notes below: </p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> 10 Minutes Of Battlefield 6 Season 1 New Maps Gameplay (Blackwell Fields and Eastwood)</p>
      </div>
<p>"As we got closer to launch, we revisited aim-assist tuning based on internal testing and the full range of maps and combat distances coming with release. Our goal was to make aim-assist feel more effective beyond mid-range fights which was one of our focuses within Battlefield Labs and open beta," the developer said. "At launch, we increased slowdown at longer ranges, but once the game went live, we saw that this made high-zoom aiming feel less smooth and harder to control.</p><p>"After reviewing player feedback and gameplay data, we’re reverting aim-assist back to the values some of you experienced during open beta and Battlefield Labs. This will now serve as the default, whilst still providing you with the ability to alter the aim assist to your preference and playstyle via settings," Battlefield Studios added. "This change keeps aim slowdown consistent across all ranges, helping with muscle memory and providing a steadier, more reliable feel as we move into future seasons."</p><p>The November 18 update is called California Resistance, and in addition to the aim-assist and other gameplay tuning changes, it adds new content, including the California-set map Eastwood. Variations of the map will be available for all modes, and for Conquest, it'll support tanks, helicopters, and the golf cart. There is also a new mode called Sabotage, which is a limited-time mode focused on "demolition and counterplay." New weapons are coming, too, including the DB-12 shotgun and the M357 Trait sidearm.</p><p>The Gauntlet mode, meanwhile, gets a new mission type in the form of Rodeo. "This mission provides multiple vehicles for players to fight over and battle with each other with. Players earn bonus points for defeating enemies while in a vehicle," Battlefield Studios said.</p><p>There are also updates for the Portal mode, including the introduction of a sandbox mode that allows Portal users to "start with a more level playing field to bring their imagination to life." Additionally, the golf cart vehicle will be supported in Portal mode, while a "bonus path" part of the Season 1 battle pass called The California Resistance will be unlocked with the new update.</p><p>Beyond the new content, the 1.1.2.0 update adds further weapon accuracy and dispersion tuning and provides a "major polish pass" to deployable objects such as the LWCMS Portable Mortar, LTLM II Portable Laser Designator, and Supply Crate systems.</p><p>Another change is the introduction of a new keybinding on PC that allows players to swap to the knife instantly instead of needing to hold the button.

But, despite the changes, some things remain; namely, your party in Reimagined. When all is said and done, it will still consist of Hero, Maribel, Prince Kiefer (who are front and center on our latest magazine cover), Ruff, Aishe, and Sir Mervyn.&nbsp;</p><p>To get you primed for Reimagined, we spoke to the game's lead scenario writer, Sayaka Takagi, and producer Takeshi Ichikawa about each of these party members, and below, we'll list out everything she told us about them.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Like every Dragon Quest, Reimagined’s protagonist is named Hero, and in this quest, he’s the son of a fisherman in Pilchard Bay on the island of Estard. The majority of his personality will be shaped by how you respond in dialogue. He wants to be the fisherman his father and mother want him to be, but he’s not quite ready to do so…almost as if a different adventure is calling after him.</p><p>"So one thing I had in mind, and perhaps this might not be the nicest thing to say about the character, is that we wanted to make him as normal as possible, the average Joe, like the blank slate that you described," Ichikawa tells me. "We just wanted [Hero] to be more normal – average – than any of the other heroes in Dragon Quest VII Reimagined."&nbsp;</p><h3>Prince Kiefer</h3>

<p>Kiefer is the Prince of the Kingdom of Estard and Hero’s childhood best friend. Despite his royal background, Kiefer is desperate to find a purpose in life (ideally away from a throne). He often lures Hero into questionable situations, but his heart is in the right place. He makes a great Warrior in combat.</p><p>"So Kiefer is actually a pretty naïve boy," Ichikawa says. "People might think otherwise, but he's actually someone who's always envious of others, and the reason why is because he's also someone who yearns to become someone – he wants purpose in his life. But despite that, he's promised a lot of power because of his upbringing as a prince, and he's from royalty. But even with that, he doesn't feel like he's serving his purpose; he doesn't feel like he's anyone special, so he's always thinking about other people that he wants to become.&nbsp;</p><p>"That kind of personality is reflected in his dialogue. Considering he's a prince from a royal family, you would think he might speak in a well-mannered fashion, but he doesn't actually speak that way. He speaks a lot more casually."&nbsp;</p><h3>Maribel Mayde</h3>

<p>The daughter of Pilchard Bay’s mayor, Maribel Mayde is cute and adorable, with a bit of edge reflected in the jokes and hard times she lobs at Hero. Still, she’s a reliable partner on your journey and grows to become someone who cares for the world around her (including the rest of the party). She’s also an excellent Priestess and Mage, though she, like the rest of the party, can slot into any vocation the player wishes.</p><p>"Maribel is a very cute girl, just such an adorable character," Takagi tells me while reflecting on what she's learned about this character upon reflection during the development of Reimagined. "I was pretty young when I played the original version, in elementary school, and back then, I just always felt like she's a mean girl, and loud. She gets angry at the protagonist all the time, so I didn't really have a good impression of her back then. But revisiting the game as an adult and actually getting to understand her as a person, as a character, she's actually very supportive of the protagonist. She encourages you, she uplifts you, and she's a reliable partner who is essential to the journey of the party.</p><p>"I have found a new appreciation for her character. [...] One thing I can speak to about writing her dialogue is that Maribel tends to say a lot of things most people wouldn't. This applies to other staff members who contributed to the scenario writing, but a lot of them share this same sentiment: writing her dialogue actually feels nice, because you get to say things you would want to say but can't really say."&nbsp;</p><h3>Ruff</h3>

<p>Ruff is a cheerful, pure-hearted boy, and he is always accompanied by a wolf that also helps in combat. Though sometimes naïve, he possesses animal-like instincts, not unlike Akira Toriyama’s Goku. He cruises around the oceans surrounding Estard with Hero and the rest of the party with an eye toward the horizon, and he’s a great Martial Artist fighter, too.</p><p>"There's a certain wild element with that character," Ichikawa says. "In the Japanese version, it leans [into] his pure side and personality. And he's someone that you want to protect because of his pureness. So we really leaned [into] that element and his dialogue; he's really cute and adorable, too."&nbsp;</p><h3>Aishe</h3>

<p>Aside from Sir Mervyn, Aishe is the eldest member of Hero’s party. As such, she’s reliable and adept at combat. She’s a high-ranking Roamer in the world of Reimagined, which explains both the apparent sexiness Toriyama instilled in her design and the class with which she carries herself. She hits hard in combat, but works well as the playful Dancer, Troubadour, or Jester, too.</p><p>"One of the main components of Aishe is that she is supposed to be this reliable person, but also an attractive woman too," Takagi tells me. "Aside from Sir Mervyn, she's the eldest member of the party, and she's a reliable member of the group for the younger party members. There's definitely a sexiness as well – she is supposed to have a high rank among the Roamers, so she has an element of class, too."&nbsp;</p><h3>Sir Mervyn</h3>

<p>Without spoiling much of what you’ll learn about Sir Mervyn in Reimagined, he’s a paladin from the past, sealed within a special stone awaiting the next fight he’s needed in. Fortunately, it’s Hero who releases him and enlists him to help on their present-day adventure. He’s a mighty Paladin, but any mix of melee and magic will be successful for him.</p><p>Ichikawa and Takagi wouldn't share too much about Sir Mervyn, and if you are familiar with Dragon Quest VII, you can probably imagine why, but I recommend you check out this feature on <a href="https://gameinformer.com/exclusive-interview/2025/11/05/how-the-new-voice-over-affected-dragon-quest-vii-reimagined">colloquialism in Dragon Quest VII Reimagined</a> for more insight into how the team developed this version of the character.&nbsp;</p><p>We'll learn more about this party in Dragon Quest VII Reimagined when it launches on February 5 on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch 2, Switch, and PC.&nbsp;</p><p>In the meantime, <a href="https://gameinformer.com/digital-issue/2025/11/04/the-dragon-quest-vii-reimagined-digital-issue-is-now-live">check out this article</a> breaking down everything in the <a href="https://gameinformer.com/cover-reveal/2025/10/21/cover-reveal-dragon-quest-vii-reimagined">Dragon Quest VII Reimagined issue of <em>Game Informer</em></a>, and be sure to <a href="https://gameinformer.com/subscribe">subscribe here</a> if you haven't yet so you can access the <a href="https://gameinformer.com/feature/2025/11/04/adventure-doesnt-wait">Dragon Quest VII Reimagined cover story</a>, <a href="https://gameinformer.com/feature/2025/11/04/the-history-of-dragon-quest-as-told-by-creator-yuji-horii">our deep dive into Dragon Quest history</a> with creator Yuji Horii, and so much more.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
      <p>Serendipitously, a day before Shigeru Miyamoto via Nintendo’s official Twitter account released the first three still images of director <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1226871/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Wes Ball</u></a>‘s upcoming live-action <a href="https://x.com/Nintendo/status/1990434772615664067?ref=aftermath.site"><u><em>The</em> <em>Legend of Zelda</em></u></a> movie, I experienced my first ever piece of <em>Zelda </em>media: <a href="https://kotaku.com/remembering-possibly-the-worst-thing-zelda-ever-did-5766645?ref=aftermath.site"><u><em>The Legend of Zelda</em> 1989 cartoon</u></a>. It's kinda astonishing how bad a first impression it was as my first-ever introduction to a beloved Nintendo series.&nbsp;</p><figure><blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">This is Miyamoto. Filming is underway for the live-action film of The Legend of Zelda in a lush, natural setting, with Bo Bragason-san who will play Zelda and Benjamin Evan Ainsworth-san who will play Link (1/2). <a href="https://t.co/fbadNgaDqY?ref=aftermath.site">pic.twitter.com/fbadNgaDqY</a></p>— 任天堂株式会社 (@Nintendo) <a href="https://twitter.com/Nintendo/status/1990434772615664067?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;ref=aftermath.site">November 17, 2025</a></blockquote>
</figure><p>To set the scene: Yes, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/media?url=https%3A%2F%2Fpreview.redd.it%2Fart-that-one-dude-when-your-homies-brag-about-how-long-v0-m7gaels0i4m81.jpg%3Fwidth%3D640%26crop%3Dsmart%26auto%3Dwebp%26s%3D6d396c382aee10504280fd6898f29415170b3027&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><u>I’ve never played a single <em>The Legend of Zelda</em> video game</u></a>. That being said, the past three decades of cultural osmosis on Earth have given me the tools to get the bare essentials of what Nintendo’s blonde twink is all about. He wears green, swings a sword, is mild-mannered, and <a href="https://aftermath.site/if-link-talks-i-walk/"><strong><u>should never talk</u></strong></a>.&nbsp;</p><p>So, how’d I get here? A patron at my friend’s art gallery, where we meet every Sunday evening for a community drawing night, came through with some VHS tapes after hearing we sometimes play old movies and shows on a CRT we roll out, substitute-teacher style, while drawing. Their humble offerings for us this week were VHS tapes of <em>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles</em>, <em>Captain Planet</em>, and, of course, <em>The Legend of Zelda</em>. After hearing my diatribe about what I do for work, everyone was shocked to see my off-guard smile, which turned into a frown as I turned back to them, minutes into the VHS tape, saying, “I don’t like this.”</p><p>For starters, the cartoon wasted no time committing the cardinal sin of character assassination of my vague image of Link by having him talk… a lot. While I’m <a href="https://kotaku.com/remembering-possibly-the-worst-thing-zelda-ever-did-5766645?ref=aftermath.site"><u>not the first</u></a>, nor even <a href="https://aftermath.site/if-link-talks-i-walk/" rel="noreferrer">t<u>he second Aftermather</u></a> to wax poetic about the phenomenon of Link talking being all of the red flags, my main gripe with the show is less about him not grunting “hyat!” or “hyup” or saying “<a href="https://youtu.be/iZUuW3YgDeY?ref=aftermath.site"><u>come on</u></a>.” It’s that he’s an annoying little shit.&nbsp;</p><p>Don’t believe me, see for yourself.</p><figure><iframe width="200" height="150" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ec6YrD4myII?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" title="The Legend of Zelda 101 - The Ringer"></iframe></figure><p>They didn’t just create one of these; they made <a href="https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLySo2SlSHPSNYc2kkPjAJHVK1ThT1Lb_P&amp;si=U1B19pgKa0z1LciO&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><u>13 episodes</u></a> of <em>The Legend of Zelda</em> cartoon. As Luke wrote for the other site, this cartoon emerged as Nintendo’s first effort to turn its properties into a cross-media phenomenon, jumping from games to TV. While still reeling from the shock of having my first full experience with <em>The Legend of Zelda</em>, and surprised that it might also be others’ first introduction, the wonderfully animated series isn’t bratty little brother energy I can laugh with, but rather an annoying rugrat I can’t wait to be rid of.</p><p>Chief among the things that gave me the ick about this Link were:</p><ul><li>Him cat calling Zelda</li><li>His whiny frat boy voice&nbsp;</li><li>His Marvel movie headass quips</li><li><a href="https://youtu.be/qzfXxkHrIBM?ref=aftermath.site"><u>His shitty catchphrase</u></a></li><li>His “where my hug” energy</li></ul><p><a href="https://www.facebook.com/watch/?v=437490007147524"><u>I can't stress enough how wack this Link is</u></a>. I genuinely felt like he gave me COVID through the buzzing CRT television screen while I watched him wander around for 15 minutes. To my absolute horror, when I looked up the series to wonder why in the hell Nintendo, with their famous reckless wisdom from back in the day, would approve of this, I found out that one of the running jokes for the Viacom cartoon was Link pestering Zelda for a kiss. I'll just go ahead and rip off the band-aid by telling you all that in the show’s last episode, an act of God causes the earth to literally crumble under his feet as Link tries to finally kiss Zelda. After what I can only imagine was months of coercing, Zelda finally stumbles into admitting that she, despite how irritating he is, loves him, and that he’s at least earned a little kiss, which she stresses, “means nothing.”&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption><p><span>A lion does not concern itself with being a whiny simp.

The second saw <a href="https://youtu.be/7VRGZEPmir8?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Mario and Frankenstein’s monster swapping brains</u></a>. Needless to say, I was coping by doing <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65uNCLBTje0&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><u>The Mario dance</u></a> on my wayward night walk home from the art gallery after voluntarily subjecting myself to Link’s debaucherous energy.</p><figure><blockquote><p lang="en" dir="ltr">My entire opinion of this movie will be based on whether or not Link says “well excuuuuse me princess” <a href="https://t.co/2wvgAkd71Q?ref=aftermath.site">https://t.co/2wvgAkd71Q</a></p>— Justin Whang🤠 (@JustinWhang) <a href="https://twitter.com/JustinWhang/status/1989863231414738998?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&amp;ref=aftermath.site">November 16, 2025</a></blockquote>
</figure><p>My only hope is that Wes Ball knows his last name and truly lives up to his claim that his film will have a more <a href="https://ew.com/the-legend-of-zelda-wes-ball-live-action-miyazaki-8410558?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Studio Ghibli-like vibe</u></a>. Hopefully, all the whiny snark from actor Jonathan Potts’ Link will be replaced with a touch of <em>Adventure Time</em>-like charm, with Benjamin Evan Ainsworth’s portrayal as the hero of Hyrule.</p><figure><a href="https://aftermath.site/if-link-talks-i-walk/"><div><p>If Link Talks, I Walk - Aftermath</p><p>The only acceptable forms of communication for Link are hiiiiyah, break jar, and journalism</p><p><span>Nathan Grayson</span></p></div></a></figure>

One of these was called </span><i><span><a href="https://kotaku.com/overwatchs-new-pve-event-is-its-best-yet-1825183663">Retribution</a>,</span></i><span> and it starred Reaper, Cassidy, Genji, and Moira as members of Blackwatch, Overwatch’s covert operatives arm. At the beginning of the mission, Reaper kills a man named Antonio Bartalotti, a criminal and member of the chaos-seeding Talon organization. This assassination sets up the mission players fight through, as well as the eventual downfall of the Overwatch organization, but as we learned today, over seven years later, it was also a canon event for </span><i><span>Overwatch 2</span></i><span>’s next hero, Vendetta.</span></p>  <p><span>Blizzard has released a new animated trailer titled La Lupa which shows Vendetta, a new, sword-wielding hero, fighting a massive Omnic in Colosseo to the tune of hundreds of less-than-adoring fans. In her voiceover, she’s talking to her Papa who taught her how to outsmart her opponents, whether that be in Chess or in a coliseum. Then the trailer reveals that her father was none other than Antonio. So now, after all those years, Vendetta has…a vendetta against the members of Blackwatch. That organization is defunct, though, so I guess she’s taking out all her frustrations on robots in the coliseum.</span></p> <p><span>We don’t see any gameplay of Vendetta in action, but she does seem to be one of the rare melee heroes in </span><i><span>Overwatch</span></i><span>’s roster. She’s built like a tank, so she might fall into that role, but we’ll know for sure soon since Blizzard is holding a trial run for the character from November 6 to December 1. Vendetta will officially join the roster in Season 20 on December 9.</span></p>

<p>Hypixel Studios is back, and they have brought an old friend along with it. On Monday, founder Simon Collins-Laflamme announced that they had reacquired the rights to sandbox game Hytale from Riot Games.</p>



<p>The news comes roughly five months since it was announced that the game was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/riot-games-shuts-down-hypixel-studios-cancels-hytale/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">being shut down</a>.</p>







<p><strong>“We are thrilled to announce that we have acquired Hytale from Riot Games,”</strong> <a href="https://hytale.com/news/2025/11/hytale-is-saved" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Collins-Laflamme said</a>. <strong>“While it didn’t make sense for them to continue developing it in its existing form, they ultimately wanted what’s best for players, and that’s for us to eventually play a revised version of the game. We are grateful to Riot Games for making this possible.”</strong></p>



<p>Collins-Laflamme said that the studio has hired <strong>“more than 30 developers who know this game inside and out, with additional returns in the coming days.”</strong></p>



<p>He says that the team is going to go back to the original version of what Hytale was supposed to be. It was added that the studio is fully independent and committed to funding Hytale <strong>“for the next 10 years”.</strong></p>







<p>As far as what’s next, an Early Access release and pricing will be announced <strong>“in the coming days”.</strong> It’ll be available first on Windows with a Mac and Linux release possible and other platforms later on. Regarding content, the Early Access version of Hytale will include a Creative Mode, Exploration Mode, and Modding capabilities. What won’t be available are minigames and an Adventure Mode. Both of those will come later on.</p>

Kennedy will appear in the game, by branding a particular image as "fake news."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Capcom continues to promote the upcoming <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/resident-evil-requiem">Resident Evil Requiem</a> as a new entry in the series starring fresh protagonist Grace Ashcroft, though has <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/capcom-says-leon-s-kennedy-is-a-bad-match-for-horror-as-fan-speculation-swirls-around-whether-hes-still-secretly-playable-in-resident-evil-requiem">never explicitly stated that she is the sole playable character</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Indeed, when IGN sat down with Capcom at Gamescom 2025 in August, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-big-resident-evil-requiem-interview-why-the-games-monster-got-supersized-why-its-probably-not-lisa-trevor-and-a-tease-for-areas-beyond-raccoon-city-just-dont-talk-about-leon">we were told that its staff members would not discuss any internet rumors of certain other characters appearing</a>. But now, in an interview with <a href="https://stevivor.com/features/interviews/resident-evil-requiem-interview-leon-is-fake-news-no-demo-and-how-outbreak-fits-in" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Stevivor</a>, producer Masato Kumazawa has at least acknowleged the ongoing speculation — and confirmed one particular image is a fan creation. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Resident Evil fans have recently been debating the veracity of an image shared widely on social media that features an older Leon with an eyepatch. Many had suggested the picture was likely AI-generated, and now, addressing this image specifically, Kumazawa has described it as "fake news."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Apart from any official information that Capcom has released, the rest is more [fan] detective work," Kumazawa said. "So I would suggest to please not take everything at face value. Considering that now is the time when AI [can be used to make] videos and photos, we don't know what's right or what's wrong. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Players are free to believe what they would like to believe," he continued, "what I'd like to tell is that, please, unless it's officially released from Capcom, we can't give you any confirmation."</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">Looking at this again, I think this leaked image of RE9 Leon is fake. The pupil in his eye is missing. The eyepatch is blurred and out of place. The hair strands is painted on. 🤔 <a href="https://t.co/KT43m1NOU2" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/KT43m1NOU2</a></p>— Paintixir (VGen) (@Paintixir) <a href="https://twitter.com/Paintixir/status/1969201826542067884?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">September 20, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Another recent source of discussion among Resident Evil fans is the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/resident-evil-requiem-deluxe-edition-includes-lady-dimitrescu-costume-for-grace-preorders-get-apocalypse-costume">labelling of DLC costumes for Grace Ashcroft found within the game's deluxe edition</a>. This pricier package advertises the fact it contains five additional costumes total, though only a couple for Grace have so far been showcased. As well as that, each in-game item is labelled with the "Grace's Costume:" prefix, something fans have excitedly suggested means that more costumes for other characters (Leon) are being held back.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"There has been a photo lately of Leon with an eyepatch, and just basically saying there's a DLC or a new costume for Leon," Kumazawa stated, "but just to make sure, these are all fake news."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Once again, however, Capcom appears to have stopped short of saying Leon isn't in the game — and at this point, if he wasn't, you'd think its developers would want to set the record straight in order to start managing expectations.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Resident Evil Requiem launches on February 27, 2026 for PC, PlayStation 5, Switch 2 and Xbox Series X/S — whether it includes Leon or not.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

<p dir="ltr">They also feature persistent lobbies from match to match that, when combined with Quick Play, results in what Treyarch states are "unique interactions that we are monitoring to improve over time."</p><p dir="ltr">The decision to not include SBMM has been a major discussion point for Black Ops 7, after years of calls for it to be removed by some vocal players, not only in Call of Duty but in other shooters as well. Ubisoft's short-lived <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/as-call-of-duty-continues-attracting-skill-based-matchmaking-complaints-xdefiant-goes-in-a-different-direction/1100-6523492/" data-ref-id="1100-6523492">XDefiant looked to capitalize on its lack of SBMM</a>.

Those include a rotating Moshpit playlist and the game's ranked mode.</p><p dir="ltr">Black Ops 7 received its latest patch on November 16, which fixed exploits in the Ashes of the Damned Zombies map, issues related to custom loadouts when using Spanish as the in-game language, and a bug that saw selected game modes in the Quick Play filter sometimes become inverted.</p><p dir="ltr">In other Black Ops 7 news, Activision confirmed in a statement that its <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/black-ops-7-developers-used-ai-tools-but-creative-process-is-led-by-humans-activision-says/1100-6536232/" data-ref-id="1100-6536232">developers do use AI tools</a>, but that "our creative process continues to be led by the talented individuals in our studios" amidst players accusing Black Ops 7 of using AI to generate artwork for Calling Cards. The game's Steam page also discloses that AI was used to develop some in-game assets.</p><p dir="ltr">In GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-review/1900-6418441/" data-ref-id="1900-6418441">Black Ops 7 review</a>, reviewer S.E. Doster called the game's multiplayer package "a fresh experience that avoids any dreaded fatigue," while its co-op campaign "is not one of Treyarch's strongest campaigns" despite some strong emotional character moments that tie back to Black Ops 2.</p>

                <p>Last month Xbox president Sarah Bond confirmed that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-president-reconfirms-next-gen-xbox-hardware-is-in-development/1100-6535554/" data-ref-id="1100-6535554">Microsoft is developing a next-gen Xbox console</a>. Bond has reiterated that statement several times as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-president-reconfirms-next-gen-xbox-hardware-is-in-development/1100-6535554/" data-ref-id="1100-6535554">Microsoft faces rumors</a> that it's getting out of the hardware business. Now, Bond is once again hyping up the next incarnation of Xbox by calling it "a powerful experience."</p><p>While speaking with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3P0bOAWNVR4" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fortune</a>, Bond said, "Hardware is absolutely core to everything that we do at Xbox, because we know that our most valuable players, the people who love Xbox, love the hardware experience.

<figure data-uuid="cb5b5a86655b2"><a title="Zelda Movie" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/cb5b5a86655b2/zelda-movie.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Nintendo has officially lifted the lid on the live-action looks for Zelda and Link in the upcoming Zelda movie with a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/official-zelda-movie-photos-give-us-our-best-look-yet-at-link-and-zelda">trio of official photos</a> (compared to the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/rumour-zelda-movie-production-set-footage-has-supposedly-leaked-online">leaked 'on-set' footage</a> that appeared online days before).</p>
<p>We've got our first look at Benjamin Evan Ainsworth's Link and Bo Bragason's Princess Zelda in their full Hylian garb, and while it's far from a detailed look at either, there's no denying that some video game inspo has gone into the design choices — who would have thought it!</p>
<p>Kicking things off with the Hero of Hyrule himself, and we're not the only ones getting some serious <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wii/legend_of_zelda_twilight_princess">Twilight Princess</a> vibes from his look, are we? The dark green tunic is a series staple — with some exceptions, obvs — but that cream undershirt paired with the leather fingerless gloves and cross-body strap has a strong whiff of the shape-shifting grittiness we first saw back in 2006.</p>
<p>We can't make out any chainmail from this first look, mind you, <em>and</em> the signature hat is missing, so we'll throw in a <em>little</em> mention for the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/legend_of_zelda_breath_of_the_wild">Breath of the Wild</a> Champion's Tunic while we're here. Sure, it's green instead of blue, but the detailing around the collar gives a certain Switch-y flare to the whole thing.</p>

<p>Zelda's live-action reimagining isn't quite as clean-cut in its game inspirations as Link's, but the blue dress is straight out of the BOTW/<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/legend_of_zelda_tears_of_the_kingdom">TOTK</a> lookbook. It's missing some of the elements that really made those designs <em>pop</em> — the white and gold detailing, the chunkiness of the belt, <em>the cape</em> (in TOTK's case) — but the colour palette certainly presents a more modern look for the princess than the classic pink ballgowns of old.</p>

<p>Of course, a feature-length runtime means that there will likely be plenty of room for different looks besides those we've seen in today's snaps, but we're pretty impressed with this initial glance — even if we do wish that Zelda's get-up was a <em>little</em> more detailed.</p>
<p>The big question is, what do you make of these live-action looks? You can let us know in the following polls, but then take to the comments to share what you like, and what you'd change.</p>

            <p>
<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/prologue-go-wayback">Prologue: Go Wayback</a> is due out in early access later this week, and ahead of that developer PlayerUnknown Productions laid out a little roadmap of updates you can expect in the coming… months? They didn't specify, which isn't necessarily a bad thing - I think setting expectations of when certain features may arrive encourages a more demanding audience - but they did give a good overview of what's to come.
</p>
<p>
Starting things off is a list of plans for the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-survival-games-on-pc">survival</a> game's world and environment, which primarily focus on adding "realism, scale, and cohesion to the world." Namely, that includes things like paths and trails that are clearer in how you're meant to navigate them, alongside river systems with "source, tributaries, rapids, and deltas, bringing new movement and life to the world." Eat your heart out, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gcS1HIci4hQ">Any Austin</a>. 
</p>
<p>
And there's also plans for more varied settlements, alongside water that freezes and thaws depending on the weather and season. That one sounds quite neat! I feel like the effects of weather is a thing that many games still don't get quite right yet, hopefully something systems driven like this can have a good crack at it.
</p>
<p>
On the gameplay side of things, there's plans to expand on the game's building system, to add in new ingredients and recipes, make it so that you might need batteries or to repair a power system, and to make it so that clothing can degrade over time, but be fixed too.
</p><p>
More miscellaneously, the <a href="https://playerunknownproductions.net/news/prologue-go-wayback-early-access-roadmap">roadmap</a> also outlines its intention to add in full controller support, Steam Deck support, an in-game camera mode, and for the streamer out there, Twitch integration that allows viewers to mess with spawns and other bits. More ambitiously (and I question whether this will be the game's downfall), the game will also let you build your own worlds, rules, maps, and experiences to share with others. Not everything needs to have user-generated bits, but Prologue: Go Wayback will have them whether it needs them or not.
</p>
<p>
You'll be able to pick up Prologue: Go Wayback when it enters early access November 20th.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>The CEO of the studio behind </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-kotaku-review-pc-ps5-is-it-good-ps-plus-1851258251"><i><span>Helldivers 2</span></i></a><span>, the wildly successful third-person shooter that recently came to Xbox, weighed in on the video game industry’s increasing use of AI and how he believes it “actually makes gaming better.”</span></p> <p><span>As reported by </span><a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/third-person-shooter/helldivers-2-boss-argues-arc-raiders-ai-use-actually-makes-gaming-better-and-that-people-jump-to-extreme-takes-about-the-tech-surely-theres-a-middle-ground-here/"><i><span>GamesRadar</span></i></a><span>, Arrowhead Game Studios CEO Shams Jorjani was on an episode of </span><a href="https://youtu.be/AyVTlQR__ZU?si=JJHjmoQPGIj-Fb5v&amp;t=1561"><span>The Game Business Show</span></a><span> when the conversation shifted to the use of AI in game development. The host, Christopher Dring, brought up the “industry moment” around </span><i><span>Arc Raiders</span></i><span>, the recently released extraction shooter that’s been a breakout hit for developer Embark Studios, and the center of a conversation around using AI in game development.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>For Jorjani, opinions on the controversial topic are too black and white. “Maybe, could it be, that reality is somewhere in the middle? Could it be?” he asked. He believes that, rather than developers using AI to “remove the stuff we don’t want to do,” people jump to “let’s never actually use AI, all AI is bad AI.”</span></p>

 <p><span>“We don’t put any AI in the games,” Jorjani says. “But if it can allow me to do my receipts faster, that’s more </span><i><span>Helldivers</span></i><span> for everyone.”</span></p> <p><span>It was </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-gen-ai-nexon-eurogamer-voices-2000643436"><span>recently revealed that Embark hired voice actors for </span><i><span>Arc Raiders</span></i></a><span>, then used AI to flesh out in-game voice lines rather than having “someone come in every time we create a new line for the game,” according to an </span><a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/arc-raiders/generative-ai-use"><span>interview with </span><i><span>PCGamesN</span></i></a><span>. This sparked a heated debate about the use of AI in game development and even negatively </span><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/arc-raiders-review"><span>affected </span><i><span>Eurogamer</span></i><span>’s review of the game</span></a><span> (which awarded it two out of five stars).&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>“I find that people jump to extreme takes,” Jorjani says of the response to </span><i><span>Arc Raiders</span></i><span>’ AI use. “I think it’s a very interesting use case that actually makes gaming better.”</span></p> <h2><b>The AI game development controversy continues</b></h2> <p><span>But as Dring brings up during the interview, Square Enix recently revealed it wants to eventually have 70 percent of its quality assurance work done by AI. QA work often serves as an entry-level role in game development, and this could be a huge hit to the industry’s workforce, which is one of the main points of contention people have with implementing AI.</span></p>

 <p><span>Junghun Lee, the CEO of Nexton Co. Ltd (which published </span><i><span>Arc Raiders</span></i><span>), said in a </span><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/arc-raiders-sparks-debate-over-ai-voice-acting-in-games/1100-6536146/"><span>November 12 interview</span></a><span> with </span><a href="https://www.gamespark.jp/article/2025/11/10/159294.html"><span>Japanese gaming site </span><i><span>Gamespark</span></i></a> <span>that “</span><span>it’s important to assume that every game company is now using AI.” But with the video game industry plagued with layoffs and studio closures, what does that mean for the future of its workforce?</span></p>

 <p><span>The ideological split is only widening. Brendan Green, the creator of the wildly successful battle royale </span><i><span>PUBG</span></i><span>, told </span><i><span>Eurogamer</span></i><span> he was “really heartened to see the community revolt against AI stuff.” </span><i><span>PUBG</span></i><span> is published by South Korean company Krafton, which </span><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/after-south-korean-publisher-krafton-announced-its-transforming-into-an-ai-first-company-its-now-offering-employees-voluntary-resignation"><span>recently announced a massive “AI-first” mandate</span></a><span> for the entire company while also announcing the option for employees to voluntarily resign if they felt they were not in line with its “direction of change.”</span></p>

 <p><span>Elsewhere, </span><i><span>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 </span></i><span>publisher Activision </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-ai-art-activision-statement-blops7-steam-ps5-2000644397"><span>recently came under fire for using AI-generated content</span></a><span> for some of its artwork. “Like so many around the world, we use a variety of digital tools, including AI tools, to empower and support our teams to create the best gaming experiences possible for our players. Our creative process continues to be led by the talented individuals in our studios,” Activision told</span><i><span> Kotaku</span></i><span> on November 14.</span></p> <p><span>AI in game development seems to be here to stay, but just how it will be utilized going forward, and how developers, voice actors, and players will feel about it, remains to be seen.</span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Less than a decade after the original animated <em>Moana</em> hit theaters, Disney has released the first real trailer for its upcoming live-action remake, and folks, it doesn’t look great.</p> <p>On November 17, Disney released the first official teaser trailer for its live-action remake of <em>Moana</em>. Starring Catherine Lagaʻaia as the titular Moana and Dwayne Johnson reprising his role as demigod Maui, the remake appears to be a nearly shot-for-shot recreation of the original 2016 animated movie. Here’s the trailer:</p>  <p>I know this isn’t an original complaint, but it continues to be wild how many of <a href="https://kotaku.com/disney-lion-king-the-little-mermaid-cinderella-1851767126">these live-action Disney remakes</a> barely look like live-action films at all. <em>Moana</em> might not be completely CG like the “live-action” <em>Lion King</em> remake, but boy howdy does a lot of this movie look like an Unreal Engine fan-game based on the original movie and not a film starring real people in real places. And when we do see real people, they almost look out of place.</p>

 <p>One scene in particular, involving Maui jumping off a cliff, looks so artificial and crappy that if you showed that to me without any context and said it was created by some AI tool, I’d probably believe you. And while some shots, like the one involving a whale and some boats, look better, I’m still not convinced this won’t be a mess. And making the chicken fully CG is boring and strange. Give me a real chicken, damn it!</p> <p>It was around this time last year that <a href="https://kotaku.com/snow-white-seven-dwarfs-trailer-cgi-ugly-bad-disney-1851712570">Disney fully revealed the <em>Snow White</em> remake and its horrific-looking dwarves.</a> That movie ended up being <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_most_expensive_films#:~:text=nb%201%5D-,22,%5B22%5D,-23">a very expensive flop</a> for the Mickey Mouse company, <a href="https://kotaku.com/tangled-remake-canceled-paused-snow-white-disney-flop-1851774677">reportedly leading to at least one live-action film being shelved</a>. However, this year’s <em>Lilo &amp; Stitch</em> remake was <a href="https://kotaku.com/lilo-stitch-remake-live-action-box-office-record-mi8-1851782470?_gl=1*8vfk2q*_ga*MTc0MjY2NTg1OS4xNzQwMzc1OTc4*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*czE3NTA5NDQ3NTYkbzE1MCRnMSR0MTc1MDk1NTM2NiRqMTQkbDAkaDA.">a massive hit</a> for Disney, so I don’t expect the company to stop plundering its treasure trove of famous animated movies and <a href="https://kotaku.com/lilo-and-stitch-2-sequel-announced-teaser-disney-626-1851785144">turning them into live-action slop anytime soon</a>.&nbsp;We’ll see how well this new version of <em>Moana</em> does at the box office when it arrives in theaters on July 10, 2026.</p>

<p>The 'Game of the Year' category is pretty predictable, all things considered, but it's nevertheless nice to see <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> get some recognition. That said, there's some stiff competition this year, and we think it's probably likely that <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/clair_obscur_expedition_33">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a>, which gained a record-breaking 12 nominations, will probably take home the award.</p>
<p>Otherwise, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> gets a nod in the 'Best Sports / Racing Game' and 'Best Family Game' categories, while <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mortal-kombat-legacy-kollection">Mortal Kombat: Legacy Kollection</a>, which has been torn apart for its lacklustre online gameplay, still managed to bag a nomination for 'Best Fighting Game'.</p><div><figure data-videoid="fMx2XNyAq4E" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fMx2XNyAq4E?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytfMx2XNyAq4E" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/fMx2XNyAq4E?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fMx2XNyAq4E?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed5d98e4ulgtnz&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>839k</span></a></p>

<p>So, the nominees for Game of the Year are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</strong></li>
<li><a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/death_stranding_2_on_the_beach">Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</a></li>

			<p>Ahead of <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-game-awards-will-stream-on-amazon-prime-video-for-first-time/">the show on December 11, 2025,</a> Geoff Keighley and The Game Awards team revealed the full list of nominees for the 2025 Game Awards, including the games up for the show's most significant award, Game of the Year (though <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/tgas-game-of-the-year-2025-nominees-have-leaked.1355809/">the nominees for Game of the Year did unfortunately leak ahead of the reveal</a>). </p>



<p>Some years, the nomination count is tight between the few games favourited to win the big Game of the Year prize, with only one or two nominations differentiating them from their closest competition. This is not one of those years, as Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 is the runaway leader with 12 nominations total across each of the categories.</p>



<p>It's worth noting that three of those nominations are all for performances by actors in the game, though even removing those three, they're still above the next closest titles, Death Stranding 2: On the Beach and Ghost of Yotei, which are both tied with seven nominations each.</p>



<p>The next closest game is Hades 2, which earned six nominations, followed by Hollow Knight Silksong with five, Split Fiction with four, and despite making it into the Game of the Year nominees, Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 only walked away with three nominations (including GOTY).</p>



<p>It's not the only GOTY nominee with a low nomination count, though, as Donkey Kong Bananza eeked its way into the nominees for GOTY, but only received one other nomination for Best Family Game.</p>



<p>As far as recent releases making the list, two interesting points stand out. One is that Marvel's Deadpool VR was nominated for Best VR/AR Game, though it's not officially out until tomorrow, November 18, 2025. The other is Dispatch, which made its way into the Best Debut Indie list after having just released the final episode of its eight-episode arc on November 12. </p>



<p>Voting is now officially open for The Game Awards 2025, and <a href="https://thegameawards.com/">you can go to the official website to cast your vote</a>. Here's the full list of nominees for the 2025 Game Awards:</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><em>Call of Duty</em> players are seeing SBMM ghosts in<em> Black Ops 7</em>. Capcom reassures investors about <em>Resident Evil Requiem</em>‘s day-one performance on PC. And Stalker 2 is getting a big upgrades on the eve of its one-year anniversary and arrival on PlayStation 5. Welcome to the latest edition of <del>Morning</del> Afternoon Checkpoint, <em>Kotaku</em>‘s daily roundup of gaming news and culture. The Game Awards 2025 nominees <a href="https://kotaku.com/game-awards-2025-goty-nominees-categories-clair-obscur-2000644825">have dropped</a> and <em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em> is leading the way, including in the Best Indie Game category. It deserves a ton of accolades but <a href="https://kotaku.com/indie-game-awards-iga-igf-gdc-clair-obscur-expedition-33-2000644070">probably not that one</a>.</p> <h2>The next Xbox will take players’ game libraries beyond the console</h2> <p>That’s what Xbox president Sarah Bond indicated in a new interview <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3P0bOAWNVR4">with <em>Fortune</em></a>. Here’s what she said:</p> <blockquote><p><span>We are working on our next-generation hardware. It’s going to be a powerful experience, and one that also enables people to take their library with them, and that’s what’s really important here as well, is that we know that while people want to play their library absolutely on the console, they also want to be able to play it on PC or stream it around the cloud.</span> <span>And so the Xbox experience starts with the console but then gives something to people that they can experience across all screens if they choose to, bringing their library, their community, their identity, and the store with them everywhere they go.</span></p></blockquote> <p>Does that mean the next Xbox will be a handheld? Will this portability come from a unified account across console and PC? Or is Microsoft relying on cloud computing and AI to make this all into a seamless experience? Whatever the solution, it will need to bring generations of backwards-compatible Xbox games along with it. Is this a big bet on Microsoft’s gaming future, or the last gasp as it pivots away from consumer tech more broadly?</p>

 <p>Bond <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-podcast-consoles-handheld-hardware-next-gen-1851261822">previously promised</a> the next-gen Xbox would be the biggest technological leap for its consoles yet.</p>  <h2>Capcom promises <em>Resident Evil Requiem</em> won’t be as busted as <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em> on PC</h2> <p>The question came up during the company’s <a href="https://x.com/Genki_JPN/status/1990370536753447333">latest investor briefing</a>, and the company&nbsp;explained why <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em>‘ ongoing PC troubles shouldn’t be a problem for its next big blockbuster. “<em>Resident Evil Requiem</em> differs from <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em> in terms of gameplay, system architecture, and network features,” the company <a href="https://www.capcom.co.jp/ir/english/data/pdf/explanation/2025/2nd/explanation_2025_2nd_02.pdf">said</a>. “At present, we do not anticipate similar risks. We are developing the game to provide a smooth gaming experience across a wide range of PC specifications.”</p>

 <h2>It took zero days for <em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</em> players to start complaining about SBMM again</h2> <p>Treyarch has tried to confirm, for what feels <a href="https://kotaku.com/call-of-duty-blops-7-sbmm-muiltiplayer-matchmaking-2000633695">like the dozenth time</a>, how matchmaking works in the latest entry. “Quick Play uses the same Open Matchmaking, where skill is minimally considered,” the studio announced over the weekend. That’s led fans to focus on what exactly “minimally considered” means. Some feel the matchmaking isn’t as “open” as it felt during the beta. Others argue that’s because the beta was free and now the skill floor for launch, where people actually paid for the game, is higher. SBMM trutherism lives on.</p>

 <h2><em>City: Skylines 2</em> gets new developer with console port still MIA</h2> <p>“After more than a decade of successful collaboration across numerous titles that we’re both immensely proud of, Paradox Interactive and Colossal Order have mutually decided to pursue independent paths,” the publisher <a href="https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/threads/an-update-on-cities-skylines-ii.1873154/">announced</a> on Monday. “The decision was made thoughtfully and in the interest of both teams – ensuring the strongest possible future for the <em>Cities: Skylines</em> franchise.”</p>

 <p>Colossal Order will handle a few more updates before the franchise is fully moved over to internal Paradox team Iceflake Studios. The shift comes after a terrible launch period for the sequel and has left fans wondering what the city builder’s future will be, from new expansions to the <a href="https://kotaku.com/cities-skylines-2-bloodlines-2-prison-architect-2-delay-1851668058">long-delayed arrival</a> of the console port. The game still sits at a rating of mixed on Steam.</p>

 <h2>A jumbo anniversary update should make <em>Stalker 2</em> better</h2> <p>The immersive shooter’s free <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1643320/view/596291616874954993" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-analytics-id="inline-link" data-url="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1643320/view/596291616874954993" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link" data-hawk-tracked="hawklinks" data-mrf-link="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1643320/view/596291616874954993">patch 1.7</a> adds a new difficulty mode and tons of fixes and improvements to its “A-Life system” for how creature and human NPC AI functions in the environment. The result should be fewer dumb moments and more clever, emergent storytelling. Factions should also feel more lifelike. They can now “expand control over new territories” all by themselves. <em>Stalker 2</em> hits PS5 on November 20.</p> <h2>Steam founder Gabe Newell’s $500 million superyacht <a href="https://www.oceancoyacht.com/oceanco-delivers-leviathan/">has been delivered</a></h2> <p>It’s called the Leviathan. It has a gym, sauna, movie theater, and more. The 15 gaming PCs onboard are by far the least of its extravagances. That’s one way to celebrate the announcement of <a href="https://kotaku.com/steam-machine-controller-steamos-reaction-price-date-2000643563">a new PC gaming console</a>.</p> <h2>ICYMI:</h2> <ul> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-pokopia-post-apocalypse-snorlax-pikachu-fuschia-2000644400">Fans think the new <em>Stardew Valley-style Pokémon</em> spin-off might take place after an apocalypse</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/cod-blops-7-campaign-coop-always-online-pause-co-op-xp-challenges-2000644358"><em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</em> won’t let you pause during the campaign&nbsp;</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/metroid-prime-4-previews-trailer-ncps-companion-2000644368">Everyone’s concerned about<em> Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</em></a></li> </ul> <h2>Watch this:</h2>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/logitech-blue-yeti-microphone-just-hit-its-lowest-price-ever-just-ahead-of-black-friday-2000644657</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>If you’re planning to start a podcast, improve your livestreams, or just want to sound decent on Zoom calls, you need a high-quality microphone in your setup. Most high-end options on the market often sit above $100, but thanks to early Black Friday deals, that’s not the case today.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5639/">You can currently grab the Logitech for Creators Blue Yeti USB microphone for just $85 on Amazon.</a> That’s after a nice $55 discount on its retail price of $140. This offer applies to the silver model, but the pink and blue versions are also discounted, going for $100 and $105, respectively.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5639/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Custom Patterns for Different Recording Needs</h2>
<p>This mic delivers Blue’s signature broadcast-quality sound with a custom three-capsule array. It delivers clear, powerful, yet balanced sound for gaming, streaming podcasts, and even your calls. You can choose between four preset patterns (cardioid, omni, bidirectional, and stereo) to record exactly the way you need for any setup. Filming a heart-to-heart for your YouTube family? Go with cardioid for focused audio. Hosting an interview? The bidirectional pattern should do the job well!</p>
<p>The mic also comes with onboard controls that let you quickly adjust the volume, pick a pattern, mute, and more right there from the microphone itself. This is especially great for when you need to take a quick break between recordings and don’t want to bother with complicated software settings. Just hit a button and you’re all set. To further fine-tune your recordings, you can use the Blue VO!CE program for editing them. This platform lets you add vocal effects, modulation, and sound samples, but you will need to install the Logitech G Hub to access it.</p>



<p>Setting everything up and getting started is simple. The plug-and-play setup means you can just hook it up to your PC or laptop via USB and start recording right away. Best of all, the desktop stand itself is adjustable, so you can always find the right angle to record without needing any extra accessories.</p>
<p>All-in-all, if you’ve been looking for a way to improve the sound quality of your recordings, this microphone can be a great addition to your setup. It’s not just easy to use, but also offers impressive sound and plenty of customization options without making things unnecessarily complicated. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5639/">Thanks to early Black Friday deals, you can grab it without paying the full $140 price.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Arrowhead Games Studio’s CEO recently commented on a possible Switch 2 port for Helldivers 2, stating ‘We’ll see’. </p>



<p>It is no secret that Helldivers 2’s port to Xbox has <span>significantly helped the game, with the developers revealing that the new platform has&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/helldivers-2-xbox-port-helped-increase-ps5-and-pc-sales/" target="_blank">increased</a></span><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/helldivers-2-xbox-port-helped-increase-ps5-and-pc-sales/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> sales and engagement</a> for the PC and PS5 versions of the game. So that sets a precedent for Helldivers 2 to be released on another platform, but the developers haven’t officially confirmed anything yet. </p>



<h2 id="h-helldivers-2-on-switch-2-could-be-a-possibility">Helldivers 2 on Switch 2 Could be a Possibility?  </h2>



<p>The comments on Helldivers 2 coming to Switch 2 came through the latest episode of the Game Business Show on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AyVTlQR__ZU&amp;t=558s" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">YouTube</a> (via <a href="https://gamerant.com/helldivers-2-switch-2-port-ceo-response/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Game Rant</a>), where Christopher Dring interviewed Shams Jorjani, Arrowhead CEO. During this interview, Dring jokingly spoke about waiting for a ‘Switch 2 version’ for the game, to which Jorjan responded, stating, “We’ll see, we’ll see. That’s again, above my pay grade by a couple of tiers.”</p>

</p></figure>



<p>We already know that the Xbox port worked wonders for the game, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/helldivers-2-sold-more-on-xbox-than-playstation-in-the-first-six-days/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">selling more on the new platform</a> than PlayStation in the first six days. However, will Helldivers 2 be able to find a similar kind of success on Switch 2, that is not yet known. At the same time, the developers are currently hard at work to optimise the game, working not only to address several <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/helldivers-2-devs-comment-on-installation-size-and-load-times/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">performance issues</a> but also to decrease the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/helldivers-2-devs-comment-on-installation-size-and-load-times/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">install size and improve load times</a>. </p>

<p>The nominees for The Game Awards 2025 have been announced. For more than a decade, the show, hosted by Geoff Keighley, celebrates the year’s best games and highlights the future of the industry. With 2025 being as great a year for game releases, there were already some tight competition. Now, we know just what stood out for outlets and the judges.</p>







<p>All of the categories were voted on by a panel of judges from various outlets. The winners are mostly chosen by that group, but fans can vote for their favorites on the site as well. However, the biggest category that’s fully fan-voted is Player’s Voice. Nominations for the category will be announced at a later date. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/every-winner-the-game-awards-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Last year</a>, Astro Bot won Game of the Year, with Metaphor: ReFantazio and Balatro winning several awards as well.</p>



<p>You can check out the full list of 2025’s nominees below, courtesy of&nbsp;<a href="https://thegameawards.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The Game Awards</a>.

And while some one-off, full-price titles were continuing to be successful, these had become "a few notable exceptions" to the wider trend, it continued.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The remarks come amid a continued period of uncertainty for Ubisoft, which has suffered layoffs and a sizable corporate restructure in the past year.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                      
                      
          <p>For well over a decade now, the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/73010/Cities_in_Motion/"><em>Cities</em> franchise</a> has done its best to pick up the urban simulation ball that <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2013/03/simcity-one-week-later-time-doesnt-heal-all-wounds/">EA’s <em>SimCity</em> famously dropped</a>. Going forward, though, that ball will be handed off from longtime developer Colossal Order to Finnish studio <a href="https://www.iceflake.com/">Iceflake</a> (a subsidiary of <em>Cities</em> publisher Paradox Interactive).</p>
<p>The <a href="https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/threads/an-update-on-cities-skylines-ii.1873154/">surprise announcement Monday morning</a> on Paradox’s official forums says that <em>Cities</em>‘ developer and publisher “mutually decided to pursue independent paths” without going into many details as to why. “The decision was made thoughtfully and in the interest of both teams—ensuring the strongest possible future for the <em>Cities: Skylines</em> franchise,” the announcement says.</p>
<p>“Both companies are excited for what the future holds while remaining deeply appreciative of our shared history and grateful to the <em>Cities</em>’ community,” the statement continues. Colossal Order “will work on new projects and explore new creative opportunities,” Paradox wrote in <a href="https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/threads/studio-shift-frequently-asked-questions.1873693/">an accompanying FAQ</a>.</p>
<h2>A new mayor in town</h2>
<p>New&nbsp;<em>Cities</em>&nbsp;developer Iceflake was&nbsp;<a href="https://www.paradoxinteractive.com/media/press-releases/press-release/paradox-interactive-acquires-finland-based-iceflake-studios" target="_blank" rel="noopener">acquired by Paradox in 2020</a>, shortly after the release of its post-apocalyptic survival/strategy game&nbsp;<em>Surviving the Aftermath</em>.&nbsp;That game has maintained <a href="https://steamcharts.com/app/684450">a small but seemingly dedicated following on Steam</a>, thanks in part to updates and DLC that seem to be Iceflake’s main focus in the last few years.</p>
<p>Paradox writes that Iceflake is currently “hard at work getting into the nuts and bolts of <em>Cities: Skylines II</em>” and will be responsible for future free updates, expansions, and content packs for that game from the start of 2026 onward. Iceflake will also be working on the long-awaited console ports of <em>Skylines II</em>, which were originally planned to launch alongside the PC version in 2023.</p>
