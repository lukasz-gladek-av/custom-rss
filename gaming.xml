            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/xbox-muddies-the-waters-with-new-game-pass-tier-and-price-hike.923622/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xbox-game-pass-price-hike-new-tier<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Xbox has introduced a new pricing tier for its Game Pass subscription service, and prices have also been hiked across several of the service’s existing options.</p>
<p>Per the official Xbox <a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/help/subscriptions-billing/manage-subscriptions/game-pass-updates-july-2024">support page</a>, the new tier is called Xbox Game Pass Standard, and it’ll cost $14.99 per month. It’s essentially replacing the Xbox Game Pass Console tier, although there’s one critical difference: Standard won’t offer day one Game Pass releases.</p>
<p>If you want to play those, you’ll have to plump for Game Pass Ultimate or PC Game Pass, both of which will still offer day one releases. Confused yet? I’m not surprised.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/xbox-game-pass-price-hike-new-tier-avowed.jpg?itok=KTJp8Vxe 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/xbox-game-pass-price-hike-new-tier-avowed.jpg?itok=M0RBvu7b 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Games like&nbsp;<em>Avowed&nbsp;</em>won't be coming to every Xbox Game Pass tier on day one.</figcaption></figure><p>As well as the new tier, you can expect price hikes for Xbox Game Pass Ultimate and PC Game Pass. They’re not huge hikes, but they are significant.</p>
<p>Game Pass Ultimate will now set you back $19.99 a month, while PC Game Pass will cost $11.99 per month. If you’re in certain countries (although not the US), Game Pass Core, which was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xbox-game-pass-core">introduced last year</a>, is also getting a price hike.</p>
<p>These price hikes take effect starting from today for new members, and for existing subscribers, prices will start to change from September 12th, with the next billing charge from that date being the first one to use the new prices.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-xbox-game-pass-new-tier.jpg?itok=OH44oPWj 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-xbox-game-pass-new-tier.jpg?itok=KVWziEzK 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Some Xbox Game Pass tiers won't be getting&nbsp;<em>Black Ops 6&nbsp;</em>at launch.</figcaption></figure><p>As for Xbox Game Pass Console, if you’re a subscriber and you’ve got auto-renewal on, your subscription won’t change. However, if you disable auto-renewal, you’ll need to switch your plan to one of the others to keep playing games on Game Pass.</p>
<p>It’s fair to say that the introduction of this new tier muddies the waters when it comes to Xbox’s “play on day one” message, which must now carry a couple of asterisks; after all, not all Game Pass subscription types offer day one releases.</p>
<p>Also noteworthy is the fact that these new Game Pass changes are being introduced ahead of the release of Call of Duty: Black Ops 6, which will <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-will-be-on-game-pass-day-1">arrive on Game Pass</a> (or, rather, certain tiers) on <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/every-xbox-showcase-2024-announcement">launch in October</a>.</p>
<p>We’ll have to wait and see what effect these changes have on Game Pass’ subscriber numbers, if any. Stay tuned for more info.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-just-uploaded-a-bizarre-horror-game-teaser<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>
Nintendo has posted an unusual and unexplained teaser video on its YouTube and social channels, for what appears to be a new horror project. 
</p>
<p>
The teaser features grainy footage of a figure in a trenchcoat wearing a paper bag on their head, with a smiling face drawn on it. 
</p>
<p>
Japanese text at the end of the video translates to "Smiling Man", while text accompanying the video simply states "#WhoIsEmio" - "Emio" being the Japanese pronounciation of "Smiling Man". 
</p>
<figure>
<p>
<a aria-label="Emio" data-lightbox="false" data-platform="youtube" href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VbhwwG-QvGQ?autoplay=1" onclick="((e) => { e.preventDefault(); e.currentTarget.closest('.video_wrapper').innerHTML = e.currentTarget.querySelector('template').innerHTML; enableElements(); })(event)" title="Click to play video from YouTube">
<span>Emio</span>
<template>
<iframe allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VbhwwG-QvGQ?autoplay=1" frameborder="0" loading="lazy" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/VbhwwG-QvGQ?autoplay=1">
</iframe> </template>
</a>
</p>
<figcaption>Who is Emio?<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbhwwG-QvGQ" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>
The teaser features a Nintendo Switch logo and, in the US version of the video, a mature "M" rating from the ESRB. 
</p>
<p>
Nintendo fans have been quick to comment on the bizarre teaser, which went live at 2pm UK time this afternoon. 
</p>
<p>
"This is extremely weird/out of character for Nintendo," wrote one person on video game forum <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/nintendo-uploads-a-really-mysterious-trailer-to-youtube-called-emio-translates-to-smiling-man.923547/page-2">ResetEra</a>. "The fact it's age restricted and the whole tone of video."
</p>
<p>
"A new Nintendo Horror IP?" guessed another.
</p>
<p>
Others suggested this was bizarre viral marketing for Switch 2 (it's not), or that Emio was an unheard-of third Mario brother. (It's-a-me, Emio!)
</p>
<p>
The promience of the teaser on Nintendo's own channels would typically suggest this is an internal project for Nintendo, which has rarely strayed into the horror genre. We've asked Nintendo for more details.

On Wednesday morning, the company uploaded a teaser titled “<em>Emio</em>” that’s only fifteen seconds long, stars a person with a creepy paper bag over their head, and appears to tease an unannounced horror game coming to the handheld hybrid sometime in the future. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="191491" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="What You Should Know About Mario Strikers' Big Free Update" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="82" data-playlist="191491,196181,194644" data-current="191491"><div><p>What You Should Know About Mario Strikers' Big Free Update</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/191491/191491_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/191491/191491_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/191491/191491_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/191491/191491_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/17353.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>The new trailer was announced on social media by the Nintendo of America account, with a tweet that simply read “#WhoIsEmio?” and a link to the YouTube page. That was the first sign that something unusual was going on. The second was that the page was age-restricted, a rare move for the family-friendly gaming company. Here’s a look at the trailer itself:</p><p>A child’s piano plays a few creepy notes. A person in a trench coat wearing a bag over their head with a smiling Jack-o’-lantern cutout pops into the frame. You can see their shadow cast against a wall that appears to be made of cardboard, with a piece of duck tape running down the middle. The camera suddenly cuts to the person’s hand which appears to be missing a finger. It then cuts to a close-up of their face before cutting back to a shot of a person wearing a different paper bag with a Cheshire cat grin on it. According to fan translations, the Japanese characters that appear at the end say “smiling man.”</p><p>Responses in the comments on Twitter have been all over the place, with some players going “wtf?”, others joking that Nintendo had finally caught a recent well-known video game leaker. Some are wondering if this is a sign that Nintendo is making a first-party horror IP from the ground-up. The teaser shows all the signs of an attempted viral alternate reality game (ARG) for a potential analog-style creep-fest. </p><p>Nintendo’s mission statement is to “put smiles on the faces of everyone we touch.” Emio gives that wholesome motto a new sinister twist. </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>In a <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/07/10/ps-vr2-frenzies-revealed-new-metro-awakening-gameplay-details-wanderer-the-fragments-of-fate-in-depth-look/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new blog post</a> from PlayStation, Vertigo Games teased new images, plot details, and a pre-order release window for Metro Awakening.</p>



<p>Creative director Martin de Ronde and game director Samar Louwe confirmed that pre-orders for the VR game start in September 2024. </p>



<p>They said Metro Awakening is a “standalone installment in the franchise, set before the events of the original game Metro 2033.”  They added that it features “a very, very personal, emotional story for our protagonist.”</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>Vertigo Games first <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/new-metro-game-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced Metro Awakening</a> during PlayStation’s latest State of Play event. This included a brief cinematic and gameplay trailer, though it didn’t reveal much. </p>



<p>Some of the dialogue teased at the “emotional story,” asking the protagonist to “focus your mind on your wife, and step into the void.”</p>



<p>Martin de Ronde and Samar Louwe also mentioned VR features. They said they wanted the VR interactions to be as “immersive and diegetic as possible,” including adaptive triggers and haptic feedback. However, they do reassure fans that gameplay will maintain “stealth-combat dynamic.”</p>



<p>Metro Awakening does not have a release date yet, but Vertigo Games reiterated today that it is due sometime “later this year.” The pre-orders for Metro Awakening do hint at a potential launch window. </p>



<p>The devs built Metro Awakening exclusively for VR. It will be available on PlayStation VR2, Meta Quest 2, Meta Quest 3, and Steam VR in 2024.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, 4A Games stated last February that the next mainline Metro game will only <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/4a-games-says-the-next-mainline-metro-game-will-launch-when-its-ready/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">launch when it’s ready</a>.</p>

<p>For the first time in four years, NBA 2K will bring the “New Gen” version of the game to PC with NBA 2K25. That means the PC version will have the same features as those on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S.</p>



<p>Previously, the game was treated as a last-gen title on PC along with the Xbox One, PlayStation 4, and Nintendo Switch.</p>



<p>“NBA 2K25 on PC will be New Gen, which means that all associated modes and features, excluding crossplay, will be available to play on PC via Steam,” <a href="https://nba.2k.com/2k25/pc-faq/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">2K Sports said</a>. “This includes ProPLAY™, MyCAREER, MyTEAM, Play Now and, for the first time on PC – The City, MyNBA Eras, and The W.”</p>



<p>As mentioned in the statement from 2K, the only feature the PC version won’t have is cross-play with the PS5 and Xbox Series X|S. For online play, it will only be between PC players. It will, however, be fully Steam Deck compatible.</p>



<p>NBA 2K25 <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nba-2k25-is-coming-september-2024-cover-athletes-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">launches on September 6</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/star-wars-outlaws-developers-calibrated-its-size-to-ensure-it-would-be-always-fun/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Star Wars Outlaws is less than two months away from its August 30 launch date, and Ubisoft Massive has partnered with IGN to unveil even more details about the open world game throughout the month of July.</p>
<p>The first feature is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6nCdIslajQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a video interview</a> with Game Directors Julian Gerighty and Mathias Karlson. The duo confirmed, among other things, that the studio decided to go for quality rather than quantity.</p>
<p><em><strong>Julian Gerighty:</strong> We don't want things to be just big for big sake; we need it to be contained, always fun, always proposing different activities.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Mathias Karlson: </strong>It's about calibrating size to substance. When you see something that breaks pattern, that stands out for whatever reason, when you go there and look there's something there to do, and that repeats frequently enough and that the quests, the bespoke kind of content of the game, make use of it so that it doesn't feel like a separate experience but it's all one.</em></p>
<p>In <a href="https://wccftech.com/star-wars-outlaws-qa-game-length-can-double-with-side-content/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">our own interview with the Star Wars Outlaws team at Summer Game Fest</a>, we were told that the game size would essentially double if considering the side content, which ranges from expert missions (in which protagonist Kay Vess helps other NPCs to get something from them), quick contracts for underworld factions, playing Sabacc or the Asteroid Field arcade shooter game, and more. But there are also emergent events happening throughout the whole game, as Gerighty told IGN:</p>
<p><em>Every two or three minutes, there'll be something that's happening, whether it's an ambush or the Empire arresting some civilians or combat with some criminal syndicates, and it's up to you whether you want to engage or not.</em></p>
<p>The video interview also goes over the process of gathering more information and unlocking more of the planets' maps, which does not happen through old-style Ubisoft towers. Massive went with a far more organic approach instead, as discussed by Gerighty:</p>
<p><em>You're going to have to take some risks. You're going to have to go to a Cantina where you can eavesdrop and pick up on some conversations that will lead you to another location that reveals a location within the open world that you have to get on your speeder to go and find.&nbsp;There will be a fog of war that you'll be able to clear up and that's really where your curiosity will open things up even more.</em></p>
<p>Interestingly, Ubisoft Massive tried to make the universe Star Wars Outlaws feel alive. For example, if you're in good standing with certain criminal factions and they happen to be nearby when you get into a fight with the Empire, they will help.</p>
<p>Star Wars Outlaws <a href="https://wccftech.com/star-wars-outlaws-goes-gold-nearly-2-months-ahead-of-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">is already 'gold'</a>, so there won't be any delays. For a comprehensive overview of the game, <a href="https://wccftech.com/roundup/star-wars-outlaws-everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-first-open-world-game-in-the-far-far-away-galaxy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">check out this article</a>.</p>

<p>Helldivers 2 has been plagued with an annoying issue, the Infinite Drop-In glitch, for some time. This bug makes players get stuck endlessly on the Hellpod drop-in loading screen. Players would need to quit the game to escape the bug, but not anymore. </p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Arrowhead Studio recognised that this infinite drop-in bug had become a significant issue for the Helldivers 2 community. Hence, they released a hotfix today that remedies this issue, but only partially. Arrowhead Studios has released Patch 1.000.405, which aims to reduce the number of people stuck in the glitch but does not remove the glitch entirely. The patch notes clearly state that the hotfix “Reduced instances of being stuck waiting in infinite drop-in.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Furthermore, the developers have demonstrated their dedication to improving Helldivers 2 by outlining the issues they are actively addressing for the next patch. These include issues with friend requests, unintended Ballistics Shield behaviour, game joining and inviting problems, inconsistent Arc weapon behaviour, and players getting stuck in the Loadout section. You can check out the list of all known issues for Helldivers 2 <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/553850/view/4246413199456152345" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">here</a>.&nbsp;</p>

Additionally, Arrowhead Studios has confirmed that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/helldivers-2-story-mode-not-happening/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a story mode is not in the works</a> for the third-person co-op shooter.

                <p>2K Sports has announced NBA 2K25, and for the first time, the game has cover stars from both the NBA and the WNBA on one of its editions. Jayson Tatum, who just recently won a championship with the Boston Celtics, is on the cover next to back-to-back WNBA champion A'ja Wilson of the Las Vegas Aces. They will grace the cover together for the NBA 2K25 All-Star Edition ($100 USD).</p><p>Each athlete will headline specific versions of the game, too, as Tatum will be on the standard edition ($70, or $60 on Switch) cover, while Wilson will be on the WNBA edition cover ($70, only on PS5 and Xbox Series X|S). This WNBA edition is exclusive to GameStop and will be sold only in North America.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4330876-screenshot2024-07-10at8.33.46am.png" data-ref-id="1300-4330876" data-ratio="0.5626423690205" data-width="878" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4330876-screenshot2024-07-10at8.33.46am.png" data-ref-id="1300-4330876"></a><figcaption>NBA 2K25 arrives this September</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4330876-screenshot2024-07-10at8.33.46am.png"></figure><p>NBA 2K25 has a third cover star in Hall of Fame player Vince Carter, who will grace the cover of the NBA 2K25 Hall of Fame edition ($150, and only sold until September 8 and not on Switch). All versions of the game launch on September 6 for PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, PC, and Nintendo Switch.</p><p>2K Sports also confirmed that it's delivering something fans have been clamoring for, and that is for the PC edition to be in line with the PS5 and Xbox Series X|S editions. In previous years, PC players had a version of the game <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nba-2k24-for-pc-uses-the-last-gen-version-again/1100-6515761/" data-ref-id="1100-6515761">in line with last-gen consoles</a>, and many expressed frustration over this. For NBA 2K25, PC users will need to have a beefy enough rig to get the most out of the game, but no longer will PC users be missing features.</p><p>In terms of what's new this year, 2K Sports is promising the "most true-to-life basketball experience yet," with gameplay said to be "enhanced" with the so-called ProPlayTM technology. The MyCareer and MyTeam modes are back, while new-generation players are getting special features like a more "interactive" social hub called City and a sixth era in MyNBA.</p><p>Finally, 2K noted that while NBA 2K25 will have cross-play support, this will only be available on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S--not last-gen consoles, PC, or Switch. No gameplay footage for NBA 2K25 has been released as of yet, but keep checking back with GameSpot for the latest.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/bloodborne-playstation-5-listed/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/a-bloodborne-the-old-hunters-playstation-5-version-is-listed-on-playstation-stars-rewards-program.923535/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/bloodborne-playstation-5-listed/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Although a PlayStation 5 version of FromSoftware's Bloodborne is nowhere in sight, a recent listing rekindles hope for an enhanced port or remaster.</p>
<p>As reported on the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/bloodborne/comments/1dzpav0/playstation_stars_showing_ps5_version_for_the_old/">Bloodborne subreddit</a>, a PlayStation 5 version of The Old Hunters DLC expansion is being listed as one of the rewards of the revamped PlayStation Stars rewards program that is set to launch in select regions in a few hours. Unfortunately, the rewards program is still offline in Italy, so I wasn't able to verify the information, but multiple users on <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/playstation-stars-showing-ps5-version-for-the-old-hunters.923514/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ResetERA</a> confirmed the listing is still up. Sadly, it's more likely a listing error, but it would definitely be wild for one of the most requested PlayStation 4 to PlayStation 5 ports to be revealed in such a manner.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Bloodborne-PS5.png"></a></figure>

<p>Despite having been released almost ten years ago, Bloodborne continues to be among the most beloved and the most popular action role-playing games developed by FromSoftware. The game saw <a href="https://wccftech.com/huge-spike-in-player-count-for-bloodborne-before-elden-ring-dlc/">a huge player spike</a> following the release of the Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree DLC expansion, and getting it to run on <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-4-emulator-shadps4-bloodborne/">PC via emulation</a> seems to have become the main goal of the PlayStation 4 emulation scene. Hopefully, Sony will see how much the game continues to be popular and finally releases the PS5 and PC port that so many have been asking for for years.</p>

			<p>The wait for Call of Duty Modern Warfare III on Microsoft's Game Pass subscription service is nearly over, at least according to a new report from insider Tom Henderson. The report <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/modern-warfare-3-is-set-to-come-to-xbox-game-pass-this-month/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">says</a> the game will be added to the library later this month and goes on to state that the original plan was to announce it alongside the Game Pass price increase news that was <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-game-pass-price-increase/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shared</a> a few hours ago, likely in an attempt to soften the blow. The official announcement may come later today.</p>
<p>As a reminder, the Xbox Game Pass for console service will be closed off to new users (existing members with automatic payment renewal will be able to continue with their current subscription). At the same time, starting today for new users and September 12 for existing users, there will be price increases for the Core option (from $59.99 annually to $74.99, although the monthly option remains at $9.99), for the PC option (from $9.99 monthly to $11.99), and for the Ultimate option (from $16.99 to $19.99). A new option called Xbox Game Pass Standard will be priced at $14.99 monthly, but it will only include access to a back catalog of games and access to online multiplayer on Xbox consoles.</p>
<p>Call of Duty Modern Warfare III launched on November 10, 2023. It was made primarily by Sledgehammer Games, although the Zombies mode and Ranked Play multiplayer were handled by Treyarch, and other studios connected to the franchise, like Infinity Ward, Raven Software, Beenox, and High Moon Studios, all contributed.</p>
<p>The game didn't have as much of a success as Activision would have wanted. Fans <a href="https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-3-sees-huge-criticism-from-gamers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">criticized</a> it from the very start, and sales <a href="https://wccftech.com/cod-modern-warfare-3-sales/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">significantly decreased</a> compared to 2022's Modern Warfare II, although the publisher <a href="https://wccftech.com/modern-warfare-3-registers-record-engagement-for-new-trilogy-says-activision-twds-rick-michonne-coming/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">highlighted</a> 'record levels of engagement in the new trilogy'.</p>
<p>Call of Duty Modern Warfare III launched Season 4 'Reloaded' in late June, adding new maps, modes, playlists, weapons, events, and more. It is the second Activision Blizzard game to be added to Game Pass following Diablo IV.</p>

            <p>The open world action game <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/star-wars-outlaws-release-date-details-everything-we-know">Star Wars Outlaws</a> is coming out next month and developer Massive Entertainment have already shown off some of the speeder biking and laser-trading in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/star-wars-outlaws-release-date-details-everything-we-know">various trailers</a>. But recently they've spoken a little more about the player's scummy travels across the galaxy, including how big some of the explorable planets will be, and what happens when you piss off the Hutts. In short, you're going to have a price on your head. Makes sense. </p>
<!--more-->
<p>“Your reputation moving in the positive direction unlocks a lot of things for you,” says Mathias Karlson, game director at Masssive, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/star-wars-outlaws-wants-to-be-your-dream-open-galaxy-ign-first">telling IGN</a> all about the various factions in the game. Cosying up to the Hutts, Pykes, Ashiga Clan, and Crimson Dawn will let you enter certain zones without being treated as hostile, for example, or it could unlock landing pads in new places. It might also get you discounts with the more rogueish traders, leading to some "exotic rewards". </p>
<p>"But if you really get on their bad side, that's another thing that you'll feel dynamically in the game because they actually send hit squads out for you in the open world to try and take you out.”</p>
<p>Sounds like some of that emergent gameplay I've heard so much about. But it goes the other way too, with good reputation sometimes causing momentary allies during a fight, says Karlson.</p>
<p>“If you've, for whatever reason, ended up wanted and you're being chased by the Empire, and you cross paths with a syndicate that you have a really good reputation with at the moment, they might join in and help you out,” he says.</p>
<p>That sounds familiar. The Division series (Massive's previous work) often sees different factions getting into small gunfights with one another, and Far Cry's warring freedom fighters often get into scrapes with the enemy when you're around. But neither is fully tied to a reputation system. The hit squads sound interesting too, but again this may remindsome folk of the mercenaries that would hunt you down in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/assassins-creed-odyssey">Assassin's Creed Odyssey</a>, for example. Don't get me wrong, open world Star Wars sounds cool. But this is an Ubisoft game after all, and they are <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/star-wars-outlaws-feels-about-as-han-solo-ish-as-well-an-ubisoft-open-world-game">not ones to stray from a formula</a>.</p>
<p>Elsewhere in the IGN video, the developers talk about the scale of the planets you'll be zipping across. They compare the size of some planets to two or three zones in Assassin's Creed Odyssey and say you can cross the playable surface of one of these planets, Toshara, by speeder bike in about five minutes.</p>
<p>"[It] doesn't sound like a lot," says Julian Gerighty, creative director at Massive, "but once you're committed it's a fairly large amount and you are always going to be distracted."</p>
<p>Some of that distraction might come in the form of geographical easter eggs, scenery and locales that fans are probably keen to go an visit.</p>
<p>“We can lean into the virtual tourism aspect of, ‘Hey, what is the distance between the moisture farms and Mos Eisley and the cantina?” says Gerighty. “There is a linear roller coaster story, a golden path, if you will. And around that, of course, there's the open world.</p>
<p>"There's a very structured intro that leads you to crash land on Toshara, which is a moon that we created with LucasFilm Games,” he says. “And once you finish the sort of linear narrative on Toshara, the other planets open up and it becomes completely non-linear and you can choose to tackle those [worlds] in any order you want."</p>
<p>Everything I see about Star Wars Outlaws reminds me how much I enjoy the visual design of Lucas' bonkers interstellar opera. But I also have no illusions as to the icon safari usually offered by Ubisoft open worlds. So consider my eye pleased, yet expectations unmoved. The IGN video, on the other hand, is pretty exhaustive and contains an impressive amount of tidbits, so it is worth watching if you're rubbing your Mon Calamari mittens with anticipatory glee. </p>

            <p>
The maker of Pokémon-like monster fighter Palworld has founded a new company, Palworld Entertainment, designed to "accelerate the multifaceted global development" of the game and the brand's further expansion. 
</p>
<p>
Palworld Entertainment is a joint venture with investment from the game's developer Pocketpair and Sony, through its Sony Music Entertainment and Aniplex brands.
</p>
<p>
The latter will stock new Palworld merchandise via Aniplex Online - which should be good news for anyone wanting plush toy versions of their Pals.

</figure>
<p>
Pocketpair's choice of business partner here to expand the Palworld brand is somewhat ironic, seeing as Palworld launched as an Xbox console exclusive via Game Pass. 
</p>
<p>
That said, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-community-manager-teases-ps5-version">Palworld fans believe a PlayStation release is on the cards</a> following a tease last month by the game's community manager, which appeared to hint at the game arriving on Sony platforms in future.
</p>
<p>
Last month saw <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-gets-new-island-and-more-in-sakurajima-update">the arrival of Palworld's major Sakurajima update</a>, which added a new island and dedicated Xbox servers. 
</p>
<p>
Palworld launched to an enormous 25 million players back in February, many of whom were drawn in by the game's close comparisons to the Nintendo-exclusive Pokémon. (There's no suggestion Palworld is set to arrive on Switch anytime soon.)
</p>
<p>
Still, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-never-followed-up-on-palworld-legal-threat-developer-reveals">Pokémon never followed up on Palworld legal threat</a>, Pocketpair has now said.

<p>Microsoft is set to launch Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 in Xbox Game Pass later this month.</p>



<p>The 2023 Call of Duty title will mark the first of the older Call of Duty games coming to Xbox Game Pass. Developed by Sledgehammer Games, the game generally received positive reviews from the community, but critics found its single-player content too short and lackluster.</p>



<p>It’s understood that the announcement could come as soon as today, which is believed to have been the original plan for the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/microsoft-is-raising-xbox-game-pass-prices-by-as-much-as-25/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Xbox Game Pass price increases and changes</a>. The subscription service price increased by as much as 25% in some regions.</p>



<p>Starting on July 10, Xbox Game Pass Ultimate will jump from $16.99 to $19.99 monthly, a $3 increase. PC Game Pass subscriptions will jump from $9.99 to $11.99 per month and continue to give you access to day-one releases.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming couldn’t verify an exact release date by the time of publication, but several sources have suggested it will be in the latter half of this month. Last week, several new claims said that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xbox-game-pass-activision-august/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">older Activision games will start to come to the subscription service later this month</a>, including Crash Bandicoot N.Sane Trilogy.</p>



<p>Are you happy that Modern Warfare 3 is making its way to Xbox Game Pass? Let us know in the comments below!</p>

NBA 2K25 will feature three separate cover athletes across four distinct covers, depending on which edition you choose. In addition to revealing the cover art, 2K also provided the first screenshots and high-level details on the upgrades players can expect.</p>

<p>Headlining the cover star lineup is Boston Celtics forward Jayson Tatum. The 26-year-old Tatum is a five-time All-Star, a Gold Medalist at the 2020 Olympic Games, a member of the U.S. Men's National Team for the 2024 Olympic Games, and is coming off his first NBA Championship. Tatum lands on the NBA 2K25 Standard Edition.</p>

</article><p>Meanwhile, those who purchase the NBA 2K25 WNBA Edition will see Las Vegas Aces forward A'ja Wilson on their cover. Wilson is coming off back-to-back championships with the Aces. She won the Finals MVP honors for the 2023 Championship and is a two-time WNBA MVP and a six-time All-Star. Wilson also took home a Gold Medal at the 2020 Olympic Games and will again represent the United States at the 2024 Olympic Games. Together, Tatum and Wilson co-headline the NBA 2K25 All-Star Edition.</p>

<p>The final NBA 2K25 cover athlete is a recent Hall of Fame inductee, eight-time NBA All-Star, and the winner of the legendary 2000 NBA Dunk Contest, Vince Carter. Carter graces the cover of the NBA 2K25 Hall of Fame Edition. You can see all four covers below.</p>



<p>This year's entry signals the return of the MyCareer mode with fresh updates and new MyTeam modes. For the new-gen versions on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC (for those with compatible specs), players can expect an added sixth era in MyNBA, a more compact and interactive City, and the return of the women's-focused mode The W. Crossplay will also be offered on newer-gen versions.</p>

			<p>Palworld studio Pocketpair has partnered with Sony Music Entertainment and Sony-owned media company Aniplex to establish Palworld Entertainment Inc.</p>
<p>Pocketpair, Sony, and Aniplex announced the joint venture earlier today through <a href="https://www.sme.co.jp/en/pressrelease/news/detail/NEWS001864.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an official press release</a> from Sony Music Entertainment (Japan) Inc. According to the press release, the joint venture aims to expand the Palworld IP outside of the game itself. "The [joint venture] will be responsible for developing the reach of the intellectual property and for expanding commercial business endeavors, including the global licensing and merchandising activities associated with "Palworld," outside of the interactive game", the press release reads.</p>
<p>According to the release, the joint venture will kick off with the development of exclusive merchandise based on the game. This merchandise will debut at the Pocketpair booth during “Bilibili World 2024” (beginning Friday, July 12, 2024 in Shanghai, China).</p>
<p>On X, the official Palworld X account <a href="https://x.com/Palworld_JP/status/1810850675980652849" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wrote</a> the following:</p>
<p>"Pocket Pair is pleased to announce that in order to accelerate the diversified development of "PAL WORLD" around the world and further expand the IP, the three companies, Pocket Pair, Sony Music Entertainment, and Aniplex have agreed to establish "PAL WORLD Entertainment Co., Ltd."!</p>
<p>Despite <a href="https://wccftech.com/palworld-ps5-tease/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">teases about a PS5 version of Palworld</a>, the 'Pokemon with Guns' title is currently only available on PC and Xbox Series. Interestingly, back in March of this year, Palworld creator Takuro Mizobe already suggested that he would be open for a partnership or an acquisition.</p>
<p>Palworld is available worldwide now for PC and Xbox Series X|S.</p>

            <p>Rocksteady has delayed the release of Suicide Squad Kill the Justice League's second season.</p>
<p>The second season was set to kick off tomorrow, 11th July. It will now start on 25th July.</p>
<p>"Thank you for your patience," the developer wrote in a short post on social media platform X last night. It did not give a reason for this delay</p>

<p>The upcoming season is set to bring Mr Freeze's wife, Nora, into the fray. Along with this new playable character, Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League's second season will also add new weapons, another map and two episodes with suitably chilly names: Frozen Hearts and Winter.</p>
<p>Rocksteady still has another two seasons planned for the future, as laid out in a <a href="https://twitter.com/suicidesquadRS/status/1749494429768146999">roadmap shared earlier this year</a>, with more playable characters and gear to come.</p> <div>

<p>Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League failed to take off the way Rocksteady and publisher Warner Bros. had hoped. Back in February of this year, Warner Bros. Discovery's chief financial officer Gunnar Wiedenfels said <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-fails-to-meet-warner-bros-expectations">Rocksteady's release had "fallen short" of its expectations</a>. Warner Bros. went on to attribute a $200m revenue loss to Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League.</p>
<p>A report then followed in July which stated a culture of perfectionism, an ill-suited genre pivot, and a constantly shifting vision were <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/suicide-squad-flopped-due-to-perfectionism-and-ill-suited-genre-pivot-report">key reasons for the live-service game's failure</a>.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/sonic-team-head-wants-to-make-a-sonic-rpg-before-he-retires-from-sega.923448/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/sonic-team-head-wants-to-make-a-sonic-rpg-before-he-retires-from-sega<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>
Sonic Team head Takashi Iizuka would love to make a Sonic RPG before he retires from Sega, though that's just a dream.
</p>
<p>
Iizuka was interviewed by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wNeWQbiawnk">YouTube channel Good Vibes Gaming</a> for a preview of the forthcoming Sonic x Shadow Generations and discussed whether he'd ever work on a Sonic RPG in future.
</p>
<p>
"Personally, I really like role-playing games," he said. "The RPG game format is a lot of fun and I've even thought to myself 'you know, for the past 30 years we haven't done a Sonic RPG'. And I'm questioning myself. 'Why haven't we done a Sonic RPG in all this time? How have we gotten to 30 years with no RPGs?!'

<p>
"So I'd like to hopefully work on a Sonic RPG at some point before I retire from Sega. But you know, that's just a dream right now. There are no concrete plans at this point."
</p>
<p>
Of course, there has been a Sonic RPG in the past - Sonic Chronicles: The Dark Brotherhood released on Nintendo DS - but this was developed by Mass Effect and Dragon Age studio BioWare.
</p>
<p>
But Sonic Team making an official Sonic RPG would be huge. There's precedent there too, as the studio have worked on RPGs in the past, in particular the Phantasy Star series. 
</p>
<p>
And that's before you bring in the long-running Mario rivalry - if the moustachioed plumber can star in Square Enix's Super Mario RPG and the ongoing Paper Mario series, why can't Sonic try his hand at turn-based battles?
</p>
<p>
Could we explore a fully open Sonic world? Would Sonic transform into Super Sonic for powerful moves? Would Knuckles summon the Chaotix crew? How would speed affect battles? Would there be classes, or romances? There are so many possibilities!
</p>
<p>
I recently went <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sonic-x-shadow-generations-is-the-best-of-00s-sonic-with-a-big-dash-of-nostalgia">hands-on with Sonic x Shadow Generations</a> myself and spoke to Iizuka about why Shadow has become such an enduring character, how Sonic Frontiers has influenced the remaster, and whether Shadow will wield a gun.

</p>
<p>
Also, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sonic-x-shadow-generations-appears-to-be-teasing-another-secret-character">could there be a secret fourth playable character</a>?
</p>
<p>
Sonic x Shadow Generations is set for release on 25th October across PlayStation and Xbox consoles, and PC (Epic and Steam).

			<p>Infinite Inside is a game experience that is overwhelming and atmospheric. This Mixed Reality/VR title is an environmental puzzler that brings the environmental puzzles into your home, and its thoughtful, mysterious world is the perfect setting for an intriguing adventure through space and time.</p>

<p>Depending on where you play, Infinite Inside becomes something of a different experience. If you’re lucky enough to be playing on an <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/apple-vision-pro">Apple Vision Pro</a>, or the latest of the Meta Quest family of headsets (I predominantly played the game on <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/meta-quest-3">Quest 3</a>), you can experience the game directly in your home by utilising the passthrough features that allow you to see the world around you. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/psvr-2">PSVR 2</a> and SteamVR players meanwhile will have to settle for a fully VR experience, though the fundamental puzzling that lies at the heart of the game remains exactly the same.</p>


<p>While Infinite Inside can be played stationary, this is a game that really benefits from a room scale setting, though thankfully you won’t really need that much space overall to get the most out of it. A briefcase appears on the floor of your room, and from it springs a monolithic stone structure, the Plinth, replete with drawers, doors, and open sections that allow you to see the consistently changing world within.</p>


<p>This monolith is the literal centre of Infinite Inside, and walking around it in real time gives it a remarkable sense of weight and realism. The draws, easily grasped and opened by their handles, feel like they’re genuinely there, and have the high-class feel of an expensive kitchen drawer or cabinet. Whatever your cutlery draw is like, it probably doesn’t house the kinds of conundrums you soon find yourself involved in. Unless a spatula has wedged itself at a strange angle, that is.</p>
<p>There is a man. I came to call him Tiny Little Man, and latterly Humfrey, but at times, he’s not tiny, he’s the same size as you. His statue becomes a key to shifting between the real world and the internal world of the Plinth, and once inside it, you see the spectre of the Tiny Little Man exploring it in much the same way you are. Sometimes he leads you in the right direction, or teaches you how to interact with something, while at others he seems lost, bereft with his seeming incarceration within this shifting tower. At times he lurks near the edge of the abyss, and I genuinely worried just what might befall him. I forgot to worry about myself.</p>

<p>Much of the puzzling, both within and without the tower, revolves around collecting parts of an object and then putting them together in the right way. At first this is a simple, straightforward object that’s been split into pieces, but soon they balloon to take in more parts, and in more complicated configurations. It’s very reminiscent of Cubism, which has been a highlight of the Quest library for a long time, but which the Meta Quest 3’s improved passthrough has made the most of in recent months.</p>
<p>Infinite Inside is a much more extensive experience than that though, and shifting between the real world and the Escher-esque landscape inside never ceases to impress. The enigmatic and moving soundtrack from Steven Coltart certainly helps, its plaintive tones echoing through both the real world and the fictional one, but the visuals create a real sense of place and height, so much so that at points I felt the effects of vertigo take hold. There are similarities to areas we’ve seen before in the Assassin’s Creed franchise, sharing in a taste for shifting stones and enigmatic tower structures, but this is a new level of solidity for VR and Mixed Reality.</p>

<p>There’s an overarching narrative that Humfrey is embroiled in, but details in the world – a record player, a pot of tea, or a radio that never seems to quite be tuned to a station – help you to build a picture of just what’s going on here. It’s thoroughly intriguing, though at various points I wished that these elements were a little more interactive.</p>
<p>While you walk around the external monolith, inside you use an open palm gesture to grasp a ball of light that teleports you to the next one, and if anything, this is the most frustrating part of the entire game. It’s probably harder to replicate the required gesture with a controller in your hand for a start, but the game didn’t always immediately realise what you are trying to do. Equally, there are points where you can see a more distant teleport point, but you can’t leap to that one straight away, occasionally slowing the pace for very little reason. Here’s hoping a little tweak can be made here.</p>
