		<p>Square Enix and Deck Nine have revealed <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/life-is-strange-reunion">Life Is Strange: Reunion</a>, with Chloe Price returning to reunite with Max Caulfield and put a bow on their story together. The game is launching on 26th March 2026 across <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/playstation-5">PS5</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/xbox-series-x">Xbox Series X|S</a> and PC.</p>
<p>Yes, Chloe is back, even if, well, you know what you did at the end of the first game.</p>


<p><em><strong>Spoiler Warning</strong> for the original Life Is Strange and Double Exposure in the reveal stream and loosely for this announcement post.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p><iframe title="Life is Strange Returns in 2026" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/b2eHeCKYHJc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Life Is Strange: Reunion will take us back to Caldeon University, where Max is now a photography teacher, following the events of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/life-is-strange-double-exposure">Life is Strange: Double Exposure</a>. However, as she returns from a weekend away, she discovers the university ablaze and all her friends trapped in the fire. Her only course of action is to jump back in time three days, travelling through a photograph once more to try and figure out what happened and how to stop it.</p>

<p>And then Chloe shows up. Now, for an awful lot of people Chloe died back in 2015 at the end of the original game, with players having to choose between saving Chloe and with saving Arcadia Bay from a huge storm. Life Is Strange: Reunion will honour your decision within the dialogue and narrative flow, and not pick a single canonical path for you.</p>
<p>How does it do this? Well, Double Exposure’s evolution of Max’s powers and the events that transpired have done some kind of timey-wimey stuff and somehow managed to merge both potential timelines. Chloe arrives as she is now haunted by memories of both timelines, while Max remains traumatised by what happened, even through it’s undone. It’s a neat path, and this game will aim to give them some kind of closure, it seems, wrapping up their combined and separated stories.</p>

<p>Together, and with Max’s group of friends, they need to get to the bottom of what’s happening at Caledon. They’ll uncover plots for revenge, secret societies, and potentially worse, and you’ll get to play as both Max and Chloe in this game. Max has her classic time rewinding ability with the spiral in the corner of the screen, choosing alternative paths through a situation, winding things back and picking different routes, and using the ability to retain inventory and position while time skipping to solve environmental puzzles. Chloe, meanwhile, has her Backtalk ability to snarkily wriggle her way through various scenarios that she runs into.</p>

<p>Life Is Strange: Reunion will be available in a standard edition, priced at €49.99/£44.99, but there are also a Deluxe Edition, Twin Pack, and Collector’s Edition versions of the game with various extras. Pre-ordering the game or buying through the first month of release will net you the Max and Chloe Classic Outfits DLC.</p>
<p>The Life is Strange series has been in the hands of Deck Nine for a good few years now, with the IP held by Square Enix and original developer Dontnod branching off to other projects since Life is Strange 2. Having bounced between new protagonists and settings, Deck Nine brought us back to Max Caulfield’s story with 2024’s <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/life-is-strange-double-exposure">Life is Strange: Double Exposure</a>.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/29/life-is-strange-double-exposure-review/">our review</a>, Reu said, “Life is Strange: Double Exposure is a very easy game to recommend. If you have enjoyed previous games in the series, this is doing enough of the same to scratch that same lowkey mystery vibes itch. The ability to shift between timelines can become a touch overwhelming at times, but there’s several things in place across the UI, accessibility options, and narrative flow to keep the gameplay smooth. What’s more, I think this game might have redeemed Max Caulfield for me too, so take that how you will.”</p>

            <guid>1411231</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>The latest <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/roundup/fortnite-everything-we-know-hub/">Fortnite</a></strong> collab has been revealed, and it's seemingly just in time to catch <strong>Stranger Things</strong> fans who are looking for anything that makes them feel closer to their favourite show now that it's over. <strong>Wizards of the Coast</strong> has announced five new Fortnite Islands, all <strong>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</strong> inspired, officially bringing D&amp;D to the popular everything game.</p>



<p>The five islands were made through a collaboration with UEFN creators <strong>Chartis Games</strong> and <strong>Teravision Games</strong>, each of them "<em>inspired by iconic D&amp;D locations, monsters, and gameplay styles ranging from PvP and platforming to a massive co-op roguelike experience</em>," according to a press release.</p>



<p>"<em>We’re bringing the spirit of D&amp;D homebrew to Fortnite</em>," added <strong>Nick Strann,</strong> franchise strategy director for Dungeons &amp; Dragons at Wizards of the Coast. <em>"Supporting creators, experimenting in new mediums, and learning how we can introduce D&amp;D to new players. D&amp;D already means so much to all those who have joined us at the table, and we hope that we can make it just as meaningful for millions of&nbsp;</em><em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em>fans. We very much look forward to hearing player feedback on these creator-made islands and using that feedback to shape future adventures wherever people love D&amp;D."</p>



<p>Here are the five islands and their island codes:</p>



<ul>
<li>DnD Boxfights – Island Code 1190-4691-0255&nbsp;</li>



<li>DnD Treasure RNG – Island Code 4958-2624-5634&nbsp;</li>



<li>DnD Dungeon Deathrun – Island Code 5806-6430-0158&nbsp;</li>



<li>DnD Bossfight – Island Code 2218-1049-5866&nbsp;</li>



<li>DnD Zombie Dragon Adventure (early access) – Island Code 2525-9596-3235&nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<p>Last year, Fortnite had more than a few major collaborations that saw the game go through major environmental changes for a limited time, most notably with its collaborations around <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/fortnite-x-the-simpsons-crossover-introduces-players-springfield-island/">The Simpsons</a>,</strong> the <a href="https://wccftech.com/disneyland-game-rush-brings-disney-parks-to-fortnite-starting-tomorrow/"><strong>Walt Disney World</strong> theme parks</a>, and the <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/fortnite-quentin-tarantino-kill-bill-lost-chapter-yukis-revenge/">Quentin Tarantino</a> </strong>collaboration. </p>



<p>The official introduction of D&amp;D to Fortnite doesn't seem to be on the same scale as any of those past collabs, but that's likely due to Wizards of the Coast claiming these islands are part of a "<em>launch and learn initiative to explore how D&amp;D can connect with a diverse range of Fortnite players in fun and meaningful ways</em>."</p>



<p>We know how far Fortnite collaborations can go, and how expansive the world of D&amp;D is. If Wizards of the Coast feels good about how the launch of these five islands is received, we may be in for a much grander D&amp;D collaboration with Fortnite in the future.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>As <a href="https://wccftech.com/deck-nine-games-new-life-is-strange-game-reveal-next-week/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">promised last week</a>, <strong>Deck Nine Games</strong> has just announced <strong>Life is Strange: Reunion</strong>, a new entry in the adventure game series published by <strong>Square Enix</strong>.</p>



<p>The press release describes this as the emotional conclusion to the journey of <strong>Max</strong> and <strong>Chloe</strong>, the main characters in the acclaimed first game of the saga. For story reasons we won't spoil here, fans would never have thought the two could meet again, and <strong>yet they will in this new title</strong>.</p>



<p>Players will once again visit the grounds of <strong>Caledon University</strong>, where Max Caulfield works as a photography teacher, as seen in 2024's game <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/life-is-strange-double-exposure-drawn-out-murder-mystery/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Life is Strange: Double Exposure</a></strong>. Returning from a weekend away, Max finds her beloved Caledon ablaze, as a raging inferno destroys the campus and ends the lives of Max's friends, students, and faculty alike. She escapes the devastation only because of her <strong>Rewind power</strong>. After jumping back in time through a selfie, Max now <strong>has just three days to work out how the fire began and prevent it</strong>. </p>



<p>That's when Chloe Price <strong>arrives at Caledon</strong>, much to Max's surprise. This is apparently a shocking repercussion of <strong>Max's merging of the timelines</strong> that happened at the end of Double Exposure. Haunted by nightmares of a past she never lived, and with her grip on reality quickly unraveling, Chloe needs Max's help more than ever. </p>



<p>The standout feature is that, for the first time in the series, Life is Strange: Reunion <strong>lets players play as both Max and Chloe in the same game</strong>, alternating between their perspectives as the story unfolds. Max's Rewind power is, of course, used to undo and redo decisions, change the course of conversations, and manipulate the environment to solve '4D puzzles', while Chloe's Backtalk ability, quick wits, and attitude let her sway key suspects and go where Max cannot.</p>



<p>Deck Nine Games aims to build on the series' grounded storytelling to provide players with meaningful choices that affect the outcome of a dramatic and surprising narrative, all <strong>culminating in an epic climax that serves as a finale to the Max and Chloe saga</strong>.</p>

            <p>The next entry in the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/life-is-strange">Life is Strange</a> series has been announced, and it stars fan favourites Max Caulfield and Chloe Price as co-leads.</p>
<p>Known as Life is Strange: Reunion, the upcoming release reunites Max and Chloe following the climatic events of the first game. It's set to release on 26th March, across Xbox Series X/S, PC and PlayStation 5. You can check out its announcement trailer below.</p>

<p>According to the Reunion team, Chloe's return is probably down to the powers that Max gained in the most recent series release, Double Exposure, which could allow her to shift between parallel timelines. </p>
<p>However, whichever choice players made in the original Life is Strange game - bay or bae - will still be reflected with branching dialogue. It does affect Chloe, though, who is having flashbacks to those moments in the first game.</p>
<figure>
 


<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Deck Nine</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>On the supernatural power front, there has been a "resurgence" of Max's rewind ability, and in Reunion she can stay in the past via Polaroids. Max's rewind power also allows her to undo everything. One thing she can't erase, though, is the memory of her own actions. Her rewind power will also be "more responsive" than ever in Reunion.</p>
<p>As for Chloe, she has the gift of the gab. That is to say, Backtalk, which Chloe can use to "browbeat her opponents during key conversations" and explore areas of Caledon University that Max can't (see image below).</p>
<figure>

<p>"Chloe Price was Max Caulfield's partner in time… Losing her is Max’s greatest regret. Now Chloe has come to Caledon University. Haunted by nightmares and impossible memories, Chloe needs Max's help. But Max is already in crisis: in three days, a deadly inferno will destroy the campus," reads the official blurb for Life is Strange: Reunion. </p>
<p>"Max's Rewind power has bought her time - but she can't prevent the blaze alone. The fire will force Max and Chloe to make devastating decisions. Can they find a future together… Before everything burns?"</p>

<p>As I have touched on, the most recent entry in the Life is Strange series was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/life-is-strange-double-exposure">Life is Strange: Double Exposure</a>, which was released in November 2024. This game <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/life-is-strange-double-exposures-first-two-chapters-are-mostly-good-but-making-fans-pay-extra-to-play-early-is-a-huge-mistake">launched amidst a major backlash from fans</a>, who were upset at how <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/life-is-strange-returns-with-its-original-protagonist-now-all-grown-up">Double Exposure handled the ongoing storyline of returning protagonist Max</a>, and the impact of players' choice at the beginning of the first Life is Strange.</p><p>Double Exposure was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/life-is-strange-double-exposure-was-a-large-loss-for-square-enix-report">reportedly a loss for Square Enix</a> and following its release, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/life-is-strange-double-exposure-studio-deck-nine-makes-more-cuts-to-staff">developer Deck Nine suffered layoffs</a>. CEO Mark Lyons stated at the time: "This was an extremely difficult decision and reflects the challenging times our industry is currently facing."</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/marathon">Marathon</a>'s franchise art director Joseph Cross left Bungie in December, shortly after the Destiny developers announced a March 2026 release window for the sci-fi shooter reboot. Now, he’s talking about what it was like to work on the game, which has a fair bit of lingering negative press to contend with – <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/marathon-catches-an-indefinite-delay-as-bungie-promise-to-work-on-a-laundry-list-of-improvements">extended delays</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/destiny-creators-bungie-lay-off-220-people-and-form-new-studio-within-sony-to-stave-off-financial-ruin">mass studio layoffs and restructuring</a>, repeated accusations of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bungie-used-an-artists-work-without-permission-in-marathon">plagiarism</a><a></a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/sony-are-still-fully-dedicated-to-releasing-marathon-by-march-as-they-sigh-in-disappointment-at-bungies-money-numbers">money troubles</a> owing to Bungie’s ailing shooter Destiny 2, and apathy about blockbuster live service games at large, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/sony-write-off-ill-fated-200-million-shooter-concord-as-a-loss-by-closing-studio-permanently">epitomised</a> by the cancelling of Sony’s once-touted Concord.</p>
<p>Many would agree that nu-Marathon’s art is its strongest suite, accusations of plagiarism notwithstanding. It’s certainly the thing I like best about the game. Or at least, find the most intriguing. For want of a better analogy at this dismally late stage in the UK working day, everything in Marathon’s world looks like it’s made of very expensive cybernetic ice cream, sold in a branch of IKEA that appears on no Earthly map. As one might expect from his previous job description, Cross has nothing but good things to say about Marathon’s art. Indeed, he thinks the art direction has “more of a responsibility for creating interest” than is usual, because the game beneath is more about “compelling spins on established mechanics”.</p>
<p>“I believed immediately in the simplified style — but the simplified style was the risk,” Cross explains in a generous chat with Mikhail Klimentov for <a href="https://www.readergrev.com/p/exit-interview-joseph-cross-marathon">the latest ReaderGrev newsletter</a>. “This look that we went for and that you see an evolution of today in the game, it clicked for me right away. I was like: This is the horse I’m betting on. And I know it's challenging. That's a big part of the point. I knew very early on, it should make people nervous. Anything new like this, at this scale, by definition almost, should be a little bit nerve-racking to fund.</p>
<p>“My instinctive way of approaching that challenge was to really approach the art side of it like production art — like we were doing product design, whether it was a weapon or a loot box or a character’s helmet,” he goes on. “Product design, by nature, lends itself to production, regardless of the industry, where you're thinking about how stuff works and fits together, and shape language and color and all this stuff. We didn't spend a lot of time trying to sell the fantasy, if that makes sense, and at least early on, we didn't invest a lot of time in creating illustrations, for example. In hindsight, I would have commissioned more illustration work. Famously, that's what George Lucas did to get Star Wars sold, is these Ralph McQuarrie illustrations.”</p><p>There’s a lot more in the full chat, including debts to graffiti, comparisons with the visual language of Roblox, and an ode to one particular character’s sneakers. There’s also some cagey talk about Marathon’s choppy pre-release fortunes, and the rigours of making the game run in Bungie’s Tiger engine without looking like a “first cousin of Destiny”. And then there is the below section on why Cross feels the art direction needs to go particularly hard for Marathon.</p><p>

“There's also something about the design of the game, where at a certain point I really did believe that art had potentially more of a responsibility for creating interest than it would if we were working on a different kind of game,” he says. “The game design, nobody's reinventing the wheel here. We're putting compelling spins on established mechanics. The narrative is also not reinventing the wheel. It's an abandoned space colony where something mysterious happened. We've seen this a lot. It's about how you spin it, and at some point, for better or for worse, I told myself that this is an opportunity for art to sort of step up and provide a level of newness to this world.”
</p><p>To intercept the obvious criticism here, I don’t think this is Cross throwing his old colleagues in Marathon’s game design team under a bus. I don’t think anybody at Bungie can reasonably deny that nu-Marathon is a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/marathon-lives-as-bungie-set-a-march-release-date-and-try-to-convince-you-the-extraction-shooter-is-good-now">familiar species of shooter</a>. Still, I imagine Bungie would prefer that it both look astonishing and blow your puny human brain at the level of the gunshoots and loot-getting. We’ll be able to decide for ourselves in not too long – as of yesterday, the game is <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/marathons-final-release-date-locked-in-by-bungie-with-the-shooter-finally-set-to-run-out-of-cover-soon">due to launch on 5th March</a>.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/anthem-bioware-mark-darrah-interview-rpg-shutdown-2000661337</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/anthem-server-shutdown-final-hours-videos-clips-stream-2000659367"><i><span>Anthem</span></i><span>’s servers have been shut down</span></a><span> for a week now, marking the end of a pretty tragic chapter in developer BioWare’s history. The live-service looter shooter’s crash and burn reportedly nudged publisher EA to let the studio strip out the reported multiplayer elements from the game that would go on to become </span><i><span>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</span></i><span>, which signaled to some that the studio was “returning” to its roots. However, as </span><i><span>Anthem</span></i><span> has been dropped down into an abyss, ex-BioWare producer Mark Darrah is disputing the notion that the game was </span><i><span>that</span></i><span> far out of left field for the studio.</span></p> <p><span>In an interview with </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Y65eoBVF0Y"><span>YouTuber Destin Legarie</span></a><span>, Darrah talked at length about the life and death of </span><i><span>Anthem</span></i><span>, and in the closing minutes, Legarie asks if there’s anything Darrah wants to “set the record straight” on regarding the game. Darrah replies that while many people want to point fingers solely at EA for mandating that the historically single-player RPG studio shift into making an ill-advised cooperative loot shooter, it wasn’t “all their fault.” He also said that, at the time, the prospect of making </span><i><span>Anthem </span></i><span>seemed like just the latest evolution for a studio that had evolved many times before, so he says he is less swayed by arguments stating that the company shouldn’t have even tried.</span></p>

  <p><span>“My feeling is that BioWare has always been changing,” he said. “I mean, by that argument, we should never have made </span><i><span>Neverwinter Nights</span></i><span> because we were a 2D RPG maker. We should never have made </span><i><span>Mass Effect</span></i><span> because we were a tactical RPG maker, not an action RPG maker. So I don’t know that that argument holds a lot of weight for me. To me, it’s like, yeah, your studios evolve, and they try new things, and was </span><i><span>Anthem</span></i><span> too big of a reach? Yeah, for sure. But could you tell at the time? I don’t know. I don’t know that you could.”</span></p> <p><span>In a perfect world, developers would be able to make mistakes like </span><i><span>Anthem </span></i><span>without risking going under, but reports about </span><i><span>Anthem</span></i><span>’s development indicate that it did some seismic damage to BioWare </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-the-veilguard-bioware-layoffs-mass-effect-1851784416"><span>internally that it’s still recovering from</span></a><span>. The company was </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/mass-effect-5-bioware-dragon-age-veilguard-dlc-layoffs-1851750767"><span>downsized last year</span></a><span> as a small team works on the next </span><i><span>Mass Effect </span></i><span>game. We’ll see if it’s enough to get the studio back on track after a decade of strife.</span></p>

            <title><![CDATA[Is Highguard Free-To-Play? Highguard Price, Explained]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/highguard-free-to-play-price-cost/</link>
            <guid>1411195</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The mystery surrounding Highguard stayed with the game until its inevitable launch. The FPS revealed next to nothing in the build-up to its launch, but Wildgate Entertainment was happy to address one major detail about Highguard: Its price and free-to-play status.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/highguard-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Highguard</a> aptly kept up a high guard following its shocking The Game Awards 2025 reveal, even as the days and weeks ticked by to its release date. This added only to Highguard’s aura, and while we all tried to work out what the game was and what it was about, the dev left no doubt about Highguard’s price tag.</p>

<figure><figcaption>It won’t blow a hole in your wallet. Credit to Wildlight Entertainment</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Highguard doesn’t cost anything, and it doesn’t have a price, because Highguard is a free-to-play shooter.</strong></p>



<p>That’s the first big stumbling block out of the way. Games like Concord have shown that charging a fee for this type of game can warrant a backlash, or worse (in the case of Concord), nothing at all from anyone.</p>



<p>The gaming world was left with its mouth ajar, watching Highguard be the final reveal of TGA 2025. By not showing anything since, this ironically increased the game’s appeal and hype. On the plus side, no matter how Highguard turns out, whether you love it or hate it, it won’t cost you a penny.</p>



<p>In fact, the game’s only real marketing at all, a few days from launch, was its initial reveal trailer. The impressive footage ended with a definitive message: “Play Free.”</p>

</p></figure>







<h2 id="h-will-highguard-have-microtransactions-amp-battle-pass">Will Highguard Have Microtransactions &amp; Battle Pass?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Many will. Credit to Wildlight Entertainment</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Steam claims that Highguard will have ‘In-App Purchases,’ but this is the full extent known about Highguard’s extra paid purchases and potential live-service elements.</strong></p>



<p>All that is known about Highguard—other than the Steam notice about the purchases—is a brief description of the shooter:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>From the creators of&nbsp;Apex Legends&nbsp;and&nbsp;Titanfall, comes&nbsp;Highguard: a PvP raid shooter where players will ride, fight, and raid as Wardens, arcane gunslingers sent to battle for control of a mythical continent. There they’ll clash against rival Warden crews for possession of the Shieldbreaker, then break into and destroy the enemy base to secure territory in this all-new breed of shooter.”<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4128260/Highguard" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"></a></p>
</blockquote>



<p>You’ll find out, like everyone else, what Highguard has in store (potentially literally) when it launches as a F2P game on January 26.</p>



<p>If Highguard wasn’t free-to-play, would it have put you off? Will you still be skipping Highyuard anyway?

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">Hitman developer IO Interactive has announced that cross-platform progression is finally coming to World of Assassination, allowing you to pick up your stealthy murders wherever you last left off.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Released exactly five years ago today, Hitman 3 initially launched for PC, PlayStation 4, PS5, Stadia, Switch, Xbox One and Xbox Series X/S. In the years since, IO's assassination masterpiece has since also launched for Switch 2, iPhone, iPad and Mac. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Next month, on February 3, a fresh update will unlock <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/hitman-world-of-assassination">Hitman: World of Assassination</a> cross-progression across mobile, consoles and PC — though the ability to carry over progress from Hitman 2 will cease as a result. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Cross-Progression will allow you to assign a specific platform as your Primary Account, with your progress there saved to IO Interactive's servers and accessed wherever you log in with your IOI Account. This progression includes:</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's worth noting, however, that Cross-Progression does not mean Cross-Purchase. So, just because you might own the game on PC, don't expect to suddenly be able to fire it on PlayStation. The same goes for its DLC packs, which similarly must be bought for any platform you wish to play their content on.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Older saves not tied to your Primary Account won't be deleted, though you will need to toggle off Cross-Progression to regain access to them.

The ability to do this will end on February 3, alongside the addition of Cross-Progression. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"This guarantees data integrity and prevents conflicts between legacy progression systems and the new unified WOA progression," IO Interactive wrote in a <a href="https://ioi.dk/hitman/blogs/2026/cross-progression-coming-to-hitman-woa-and-new-look-to-ioi-account" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">blog post</a> on the changes. "Past February 3rd 9:00 UTC players won’t be able to proceed to the Hitman 2 to Hitman 3 carryover, giving you two weeks to proceed to the carryover if you are yet to do so."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">IO Interactive has three main productions right now: ongoing work on Hitman: World of Assassination, including work on a co-op mode, James Bond blockbuster 007 First Light, and a new fantasy IP appropriately codenamed Project Fantasy.

He said saving the game and releasing it had been “the most challenging but rewarding experience of my life.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Hytale has endured a tumultuous development. It was announced in December 2018 with a trailer that so far has an incredible 62 million views on <a href="https://youtu.be/o77MzDQT1cg?feature=shared" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>YouTube</u></a>. The idea was to expand on the likes of Minecraft by combining the scope of a sandbox with the depth of a roleplaying game, all set in a procedurally generated world.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Excitement around Hytale was fueled by the experience of the developers themselves, who co-founded Hypixel, one of the most influential Minecraft servers in the world. League of Legends developer Riot Games invested in the project and, in 2020, bought the studio outright.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But in June last year development on Hytale stopped and Hypixel Studios began winding down operations. It was thought Hytale was canceled, destined never to release. But in November, Riot confirmed it had sold the rights to Hytale back to Collins-Laflamme as this "gives players the best chance to one day experience a revised version of the game they've been waiting for."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In a <a href="https://x.com/Simon_Hypixel/status/2006090043665088900" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>statement</u></a> published at the end of 2025, Collins-Laflamme expressed his "anger" at what had happened to Hytale over the years.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"The game has insane potential, but four years of engineering went into rebuilding the engine rather than gameplay features," he said. "That leaves us with a four-year gap and a lot of catching up to do, and that rebuilt engine is never gonna be used.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"When you don’t invest in gameplay, you don’t just lose time. You lose momentum, iteration, and player feedback. Now the focus has to be on gameplay first and rebuilding trust by actually shipping things at a rapid pace.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"It’s a damn miracle we were able to salvage Hytale. It was barely playable. All basics were broken. Camera, movement, combat, crafting, building, gameloop, sounds, rendering. Everything, everything was wrong.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"It should have taken years to fix, but within weeks, we got the game into a playable, fun state. And now, instead of slowing down or celebrating a release, we have to keep pushing for years to make up for the time that was lost.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"So yes, I feel anger. And I’m turning that into focus and execution. I’m committing more money, more time, and personal sacrifice to deliver the game this vision deserves."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fast forward to the early access launch, and it sounds like all the heartache was worth it. Even before the early access launch, Collins-Laflamme said <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hytale-isnt-even-out-yet-and-its-already-made-enough-money-to-cover-the-next-2-years-of-development-costs">Hytale had already made enough money to cover the next two years of development</a>. And now, he’s told fans he can call the launch a success.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“It’s now been seven days since early access launch and I can confidently say that I have no regrets saving Hytale, it’s been the most challenging but rewarding experience of my life,” Collins-Laflamme said in <a href="https://x.com/Simon_Hypixel/status/2013636980626595976" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a post on X / Twitter</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Thank you everyone for the amazing support, and a big thank you for the rebuilt Hytale team for trusting me to get this to the finish line in just a few months. I haven’t been involved with Hytale development for many years and coming back was a big unknown and risk for me, and my family. I fully trusted the people and it just worked. Amazing team, every single one made a big difference.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Work on updating Hytale continues, with Update 2 coming this week.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>After <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2026/01/15/life-is-strange-livestream-will-reveal-a-new-game-launching-this-year">teasing the next Life is Strange game</a> last week, a special livestream that aired this afternoon revealed the next entry is called Life is Strange: Reunion. Max Caulfield returns yet again, alongside her original BFF and fan favorite character, Chloe Price.</p><p>Developed by Deck Nine, Reunion is a direct follow-up to 2024’s Life is Strange: Double Exposure. Set once again in Caledon University, the school has been mysteriously set ablaze. Although Max manages to escape the fire thanks to her time rewind power (which makes its full return), all of her friends, the students, and the faculty are killed.</p><p>Max avoids this fate by jumping back in time through a selfie and has three days to uncover how the fire started to prevent the school's destruction. However, due to Max’s reality-shifting actions during the events of Double Exposure (which we won’t spoil), Chloe appears at Caledon University. She’s understandably confused and haunted by memories of a past she never lived, and needs Max’s help.</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rrxm00_0jPE"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rrxm00_0jPE" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>Players switch between controlling Max and Chloe in Reunion, offering two perspectives on the story. Max can use her rewind power to redo decisions and manipulate the environment to solve four-dimensional puzzles. Chloe (voiced once again by Rhianna DeVries) has her Backtalk dialogue mechanic from <a href="https://gameinformer.com/games/life_is_strange_before_the_storm/b/playstation4/archive/2018/03/07/life-is-strange-before-the-storm-complete-review.aspx">Life is Strange: Before the Storm</a>, channeling her quick wits and attitude to steer conversations in ways Max can’t, which will let Chloe access information and areas her bestie couldn’t. Regardless of how the story shakes out, Deck Nine bills Reunion as the big conclusion to Max and Chloe's story.&nbsp;</p><p>Life is Strange: Reunion is launching on March 26 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC. In addition to a $39.99 Standard Edition, the game will be available in three special editions, one of which is a bundle that contains Double Exposure. We’ve detailed each one below:</p><p><strong><u>Deluxe Edition – $49.99</u></strong>&nbsp;</p><ul><li>Full Game</li><li>Digital Mini Soundtrack</li><li>Digital Art Book</li><li>Digital Comic</li><li>Exclusive Behind-the-Scenes Documentary with actors Hannah Telle (Max) and Rhianna DeVries (Chloe)</li></ul><p><strong><u>Twin Pack – $59.99 MSRP*</u></strong></p><ul><li>Life is Strange: Reunion – Standard Edition</li><li>Life is Strange: Double Exposure – Standard Edition</li></ul><p>* By pre-ordering the Twin Pack, players will get immediate access to Life is Strange: Double Exposure</p><p><strong><u>Collector’s Edition – $99.99 MSRP (Available only on the Square Enix Store)</u></strong></p><ul><li>Full Game</li><li>Collector's Goods box and sleeve with exclusive artwork by Ilya Kuvshinov</li><li>12” Vinyl Soundtrack featuring 12 amazing songs from the game on an orange 12” EcoRecord vinyl</li><li>Double-Sided drugstore makeup 24” x 12” Poster</li><li>Rewind Symbol Felt Slipmat</li><li>3x Custom Double-Sided Guitar Plectrums with six unique designs</li><li>3x Polaroid Art Cards celebrating Max and Chloe</li></ul><p>Note: In North America, players will also have the option to purchase a Collector’s Edition without the game included.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/2026/01/20/chloe-price-returns-in-life-is-strange-reunion-this-march]]></content:encoded>

<p>The 'Freeze Break' event kicked off today (<strong>20th Jan</strong>) and will be sticking around until <strong>27th Jan at 7:59am GMT / 8:59am CET / 11:59 PT (26th)</strong> — so there's plenty of time to get in and grab the rewards.</p>

<p>As we've seen previously, 'Freeze Break' will challenge you to complete the Emerald Rush roguelike mode only using a limited number of perks and upgrades. This one takes place entirely on the Freezer Layer, fittingly, so prepare to mix up your approach with whatever boosts are available.</p>

<p>The launch of the studio's first new IP in years since the launch of Destiny in 2014, however, will be remarkable even for those who own a <strong>PlayStation 5 Pro</strong> but may not be fans of the team which created the iconic <a href="https://wccftech.com/its-a-bold-claim-to-reconnect-with-the-community-without-multiplayer-can-halo-campaign-evolved-really-bring-players-back-together/"><strong>Halo</strong></a> back in the days of the original Xbox, as <em>Marathon</em> will be putting the power of the system to some interesting use.</p>



<p>In the game's <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/marathon/"><strong>landing page on the PlayStation Official Website</strong></a>, it is confirmed that the extraction shooter will be a PS5 Pro Enhanced title. <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">"PS5 Pro Enhanced PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution (PSSR) blends 5K internal rendering into a clean, stable 4K image so your Runner’s view stays sharp, even when the action gets hectic,"</em> the dedicated box on the website reads.</p>



<p>Barring a potential mistake, this would make <em>Marathon</em> the first P<strong>layStation 5 Pro Enhanced competitive title that renders internally at 5K resolution</strong>. Although this isn't really surprising, considering the power of the Sony console and how the game doesn't seem to be <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/bungie-reveals-mild-marathon-pc-system-requirements/">extremely demanding</a></strong>, it may have made more sense to tout how the <strong>PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution would deliver a 4K resolution output with 120 FPS support</strong>, which would definitely be preferable for a shooter than the sharpest image quality., </p>



<p>Hopefully, the system will still be able to deliver the high-framerate <span data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">gameplay experience that is perfect for a game such as <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Marathon</em>, possibly with the&nbsp;<strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">new version of PlaySt</strong></span><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">ation Spectral Super Resolution,&nbsp;</strong>which will reportedly be available by March 2026.

It's coming to PC and Xbox Series X|S (and, presumably, other platforms) on March 26th.</p><p>The goal, according to the <em>Life Is Strange </em>team, is to give Chloe and Max "the ending they deserve" and to provide a "thrilling finale" to the stories of both characters in a reunion "thought impossible".

<p>If you're wondering how Chloe was able to return after the events of the original <em>Life Is Strange</em>, well, the team says it "may be due to Max's power", making reference to the conclusion of 2024's episodic<em> Double Exposure</em>, in which Max merged parallel timelines and recovered her Rewind ability.</p><p>Chloe, however, is "no prize to be won", as the <em>Life Is Strange </em>folks say; she's her own woman, which is why she'll be the co-protagonist of this game alongside Max.</p><p>They'll be trying to find their way back to each other over the course of <em>Reunion</em>, each offering "alternating views of the world" and "different-but-complementary perspectives" on the events of the story.</p><p>Once again, Max is able to rewind time, a power she'll be using to both escape and get herself into some pretty tricky situations. Chloe's Backtalk ability returns, too, allowing her to smart-talk her conversation partners.</p><figure role="group">

            <link>https://kotaku.com/life-is-strange-reunion-chloe-announcement-release-date-2000661323</link>
            <guid>1411138</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/life-is-strange-5-reunion-chloe-max-summary-plot-leak-2000658198">The rumors were true</a>. <em>Life Is Strange: Reunion</em> is coming, and it’s bringing Chloe Price back into the fold after 2024’s <em>Double Exposure&nbsp;</em>hinted at her return. Perhaps most surprisingly, however, it’s coming out in just two months.</p> <p>The official announcement is <a href="https://x.com/LifeIsStrange/status/2011829955592585531?s=20">set to go live at 1 p.m. Eastern</a>, but Xbox Wire posted <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2026/01/20/life-is-strange-reunion-reveal/">its announcement blog a bit early</a>.&nbsp;<em>Reunion&nbsp;</em>will star both Max Caulfield and Chloe as co-protagonists, with both having different gameplay mechanics. Max is able to rewind time as she did in the first&nbsp;<em>Life Is Strange</em>, while Chloe will use her argumentative “Backtalk” mechanic from the prequel&nbsp;<em>Before the Storm</em>.</p>

 <p>The big question is how Chloe is able to return despite her possibly dying at the end of the original&nbsp;<em>Life Is Strange</em>, a choice that&nbsp;<em>Double Exposure&nbsp;</em>made a point to import. Based on this line in the blog post, it seems like it may be as a result of the timeline jumping Max did in&nbsp;<em>Double Exposure</em>, though I expect the minutiae of this to be affected by which choice you made way back in 2015.</p> <blockquote><p>Chloe’s return may be due to Max’s power, in particular, the power Max gained in <em>Life is Strange: Double Exposure</em>&nbsp;to Shift between parallel timelines — a power Max subsequently lost when she merged those timelines back together and recovered her ability to Rewind.</p></blockquote> <p>Whatever the case, it does seem like&nbsp;<em>Reunion</em> is not undoing either choice, as the blog says “Whether Chloe lived or died in Arcadia Bay, and whether she and Max were friends or lovers — these choices are key not just to the&nbsp;<em>past</em>&nbsp;you’ll confirm as you play, but to the&nbsp;<em>future&nbsp;</em>you’ll fight for the chance to build.” So I will hold judgement for the time being, and I won’t have to wait long, as&nbsp;<em>Reunion</em> is coming to PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S on March 27.</p>

  <p><b data-stringify-type="bold">Update: 1/20/26, 1:00 p.m. ET:&nbsp;</b>Alright now that the actual announcement livestream is up, we know how the game will handle both endings.</p> <h2>How&nbsp;<em>Reunion&nbsp;</em>handles both&nbsp;<em>Life Is Strange</em> endings</h2> <p>As expected, Max’s merging of the timelines at the end of&nbsp;<em>Double Exposure</em> is at the heart of Chloe’s appearance. Rhianna DeVries, who voiced the character in&nbsp;<em>Before the Storm</em>, is reprising the role in&nbsp;<em>Reunion</em>, and the version of her we meet seems to have contradictory memories from both timelines. Though where she truly originates from will seemingly be affected by the decision you made at the end of&nbsp;<em>Life Is Strange</em>. You can see an example of two exchanges between Max and Chloe that play out differently depending on which choice you made at the 37-minute mark of the reveal stream above.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Microsoft has announced the next Life Is Strange game, “Life is Strange: Reunion,” which will conclude the story of fan favorites Max and Chloe. Due out on March 26, the game is coming to current-generation consoles, and <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2026/01/20/life-is-strange-reunion-reveal/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Xbox Wire</a> appears to have shared the news ahead of a dedicated stream officially announcing the next game in the series.</p>



<p>The title of the game was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/unannounced-life-is-strange-reunion-rated-by-pegi-in-europe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">revealed through a PEGI rating </a>early in January 2026, and now players know there’s just a little more than 2 months until they can begin the journey to end the story of Max and Chloe.</p>



<h2 id="h-the-fate-of-max-and-chloe-is-in-your-hands-in-life-is-strange-reunion">The Fate of Max and Chloe Is in Your Hands in Life Is Strange: Reunion</h2>



<p>Andrew James, the Senior Brand Manager of Life Is Strange, wrote the blog on Xbox Wire announcing the next game. In the piece, he spoke about his own emotional connection to the story and promised fans the opportunity to decide how to bring Max and Chloe’s story to a definitive conclusion.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Max and Chloe’s relationship is at the core of the story, a relationship that YOU will choose how to develop over the course of the game. Whether Chloe lived or died in Arcadia Bay, and whether she and Max were friends or lovers — these choices are key not just to the past you’ll confirm as you play, but to the future you’ll fight for the chance to build.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>During the official live stream on January 20, Hannah Telle, the actor behind Max Caulfield, and Rhianna DeVries, who portrays Chloe Price, explained how the story would come together based on the decisions players made in prior games. In this new title, Max will learn that she changed more than just the events in Life Is Strange: Double Exposure when she converged timelines.</p>



<h2 id="h-through-the-fire-and-the-flames-we-carry-on">Through the Fire and the Flames We Carry On</h2>



<p>The crux of the story in Reunion will be a fire that breaks out at Caledon University, and Max will use her returning rewind abilities to try to save her friends and students. Max will also be able to stay in the past and begin again after leaping into Polaroid photos to try to escape the fire. Meanwhile, players will also be able to control Chloe, who can use her Backtalk ability to gain answers and advance the story.</p>



<p>Additionally, there’s campus drama, secret societies, and many questions surrounding Max’s role in the fire that players will need to discover as they work toward their perfect finale for these beloved characters.</p>

<p>Final Fantasy 7 Remake Intergrade has been out for a few years, but you poor Xbox and Nintendo Switch players have had to wait your turn. Square Enix has heard the cries of the planet, and yours, and the FF7 Remake Intergrade release date beckons for the forgotten consoles.</p>



<p>It feels like a lifetime ago that the FF7 Remake debuted on the PS4! It arrived during a weird time for the real world, mirroring the thematic struggles of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/final-fantasy-7-remakes-buster-sword-almost-had-a-more-realistic-version/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Final Fantasy 7 Remake</a>‘s planet. A lot of time has passed since then, so let’s check out the difference in platforms and new release dates.</p>







<h2 id="h-when-is-final-fantasy-7-remake-intergrade-coming-out-on-xbox-series-x-s-amp-nintendo-switch-2">When Is Final Fantasy 7 Remake Intergrade Coming Out On Xbox Series X|S &amp; Nintendo Switch 2?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Cloud nine. Credit to Square Enix</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>A January 22 release date is currently locked in for Final Fantasy 7 Remake Intergrade on Xbox Series X|S and Nintendo Switch 2 owners.</strong></p>



<p>PlayStation has gotten to enjoy Intergrade for years, and even a PC port has been commissioned in between. The final bridge that needed to be crossed was the one connecting to Xbox and Nintendo. There were doubts if it was ever going to happen.</p>



<p>The timeline on this has been fun, though: Firstly, we heard in June 2025 that the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/final-fantasy-7-remake-releasing-on-xbox/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Final Fantasy 7 Remake was finally releasing on Xbox</a>. After a few months, FF fans learned that the full <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/final-fantasy-7-remake-trilogy-officially-confirmed-for-xbox-and-switch-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Final Fantasy 7 Remake Trilogy was confirmed for Xbox and Switch 2</a>!</p>



<p>The experience should be amazing, but if you’re on Nintendo Switch 2, be warned that it will be <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/final-fantasy-7-remake-will-be-close-to-100gb-on-switch-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">close to 100GB on Switch 2</a>!</p>







<h2 id="h-can-you-buy-final-fantasy-7-remake-intergrade-on-ps5">Can You Buy Final Fantasy 7 Remake Intergrade On PS5?</h2>



<p><strong>Yes, a PS5 version of Final Fantasy 7 Remake Intergrade is real, and has been available since June 10, 2021.</strong></p>



<p>The PS4 was first associated with FF7 Remake and the Intergrade upgrade. However, it seemed sensible to clear up all platforms and reveal if Intergrade has made its Chocobo-w on PlayStation 5.</p>



<p>Come January 22, FF7 Remake Intergrade will be available on most main formats.</p>



<p>Let IG know if you’re planning on picking up the Final Fantasy 7 Remake Intergrade on either Xbox Series X|S or Nintendo Switch 2. The place to do this is simple: <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1433093283558719611/1433112738133180426" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Insider Gaming Official Discord Server</a>.</p>



<hr>



<p>It’s time to look ahead to FF7’s future. Read about the report that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/final-fantasy-7-remake-part-3s-game-experience-is-more-or-less-complete/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Final Fantasy 7 Remake Part 3’s game experience is ‘More or Less Complete’</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>As anyone that watched the last few seasons of Lost will tell you, it’s quite difficult to go back to the island. That’s something that I definitely felt when loading back into <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/games/animal-crossing-new-horizons">Animal Crossing: New Horizons</a> on <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a>. Thankfully, getting back to my island isn’t so traumatic. Having transferred from Switch to OLED to Switch 2, my old island from 2020 is still there, the one that I visited almost every day for over a year, and it’s been nice to revisit it, to soak in some of the relaxed charms, the idle busywork, and explore <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2026/01/15/the-animal-crossing-new-horizons-3-0-update-went-live-a-little-bit-early/">what’s new in Update 3.0</a>, but will it draw me back in to resume my daily grind? Will I become the new Jacob… again?</p>
<p><iframe title="Animal Crossing: New Horizons – Free Ver. 3.0 update, out now!" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BVT_aPcKZZU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The best thing that Nintendo has done for Animal Crossing with this update is to bring it to both the Nintendo Switch 2 and original Switch. Everything from the new dockside hotel, through to Resetti and smaller quality of life improvements, is available across both systems. The paid Switch 2 upgrade is a fairly light garnish on top of this.</p>


<p>Let’s start with the headline feature, the new hotel on the pier, run by the Kapp’n family. While it’s obviously a shrunken-down echo of the Happy Home Paradise DLC, the hotel is still a lovely free addition to the game that tickles your interior designer creativity with eight hotel rooms to decorate and theme. It’s also a great way to explore the support for Joy-Con 2 mouse mode support on Switch 2, which brings a pretty natural and fluid way to click, drag and place items within a room. But there are limits to mouse mode, which are a touch disappointing, as you can only use it when decorating a building interior, and it really is just for placement, so you have to resort to buttons to sift through the billions of items it feels like you have in the design inventory.</p>


<p>There’s also a new crafting mission box, with Tom Nook asking you to craft specific items for Kapp’n to sell, with more hotel store tickets as a reward. For an established player, it’s pretty easy to dip into this, with the first four items of each day awarding double tickets. What makes it even easier is the excellent quality of life improvement, so that you can craft using materials from your home storage, instead of needing to fill your inventory with the specific materials, that your home storage can go up to 9,000 items now, and that you can craft in multiples. It drains so much of the tedium out of crafting that it will feel awful to go back to anything less.</p>

<p>Once you’ve exhausted the possibilities there, the challenge for a returning player is what to do next? There’s the temptation, between the new consoles and these new updates, to start a completely new island and reshape it from scratch, but that’s honestly not for me. There’s also the option to dramatically overhaul your existing island, and Resetti can help with cleaning up chunks of land for you, but I find that comes with a hefty mental burden as well. So I’m thankful for the new Slumber Island, to give a lower stress path to creating a new island without removing what you previously built up.</p>
<p>You have the full creative tools available to you in the Slumber Island, and you’re presented with a fresh island to act as your canvas. It’s great being able to really share this with other players, giving other players full creative input alongside you. I can absolutely see this mode as Nintendo experimenting with the future of Animal Crossing multiplayer and collaboration.</p>

<p>This brings us to the Switch 2 of it all, with a fairly demure upgrade tied to a relatively minimal fee. The game resolution has been improved, which helps a bit with clarity since you’re not forcing 720p on a 1080p screen, but it’s a fairly minor-feeling improvement, especially as the game remains at 30fps.</p>
<p>Heading online, Switch 2 players can enable CameraPlay alongside GameChat and have their face beamed across the internet in a little bubble by their character. That works both in a Switch 1 compatible session (though is only displayed for Switch 2), and in the expanded 12-player sessions that are for Switch 2 Edition players only. A nice feature for those still with a dozen friends and family who are keen for a big meet up, but not one that I was able to test to this extent. You do still have the same fussiness with the game halting every time someone flies in and out.</p>

<p>I think Nintendo struck a great balance while updating Animal Crossing: New Horizons for Nintendo Switch 2. It’s not really enough to transform the game back into a daily obsession for me, but I can appreciate what it offers to players that never left their island behind or who are coming to the game for the first time on Nintendo Switch 2. It’s still the ideal island escape from the real world and remains free of smoke monsters.</p>

<p>As easy as A, B, Sea</p>
</section></header><section>

<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/sail_forth">Sail Forth</a> floated onto Switch back in 2022 with its adorable seafaring adventures reminding us of a beautiful blend of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/no_mans_sky">No Man's Sky</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/legend_of_zelda_the_wind_waker">Wind Waker</a>. A little over three years on, developer Festive Vector and publisher The Quantum Astrophysicists Guild have launched a new version to make the most of the Switch 2's fancy features.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/sail-forth-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Sail Forth - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition</a>, as it is creatively called, is now available on the <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Games/Nintendo-Switch-download-software/Sail-Forth-1695260.html">Switch eShop</a> for <strong>$19.99</strong> <em>or</em> as a free upgrade pack to all those who already own the game.</p>
<p>There's no new content, per se (bar the last three years of updates and DLC), but it certainly sounds like a much better experience from a technical standpoint. The new edition boasts 1080p resolution in handheld, 4K in docked, faster load times and a boosted frame rate. Water shadows and reflections have now also been enabled, and there's the power to render more boats on screen at once.</p>

<p>It sounds like some welcome changes, especially given that our main gripes with the game back in 2022 were on the technical side of things. "While it isn’t perfectly put together, and the playful nature of the graphics might not be to everyone’s taste," we wrote in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/sail-forth">our review</a>, "Sail Forth has more going for it than against it." Hey, it might just be the perfect way to unwind on a grey January evening.</p>

            <p>Following such recent news highlights as "<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/marathons-final-release-date-locked-in-by-bungie-with-the-shooter-finally-set-to-run-out-of-cover-soon">It’s out on March 5th</a>" and "<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungie-reveals-marathon-cast-baldurs-gate-3-clair-obscur">It’s got that Ben Starr guy in it</a>," <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/marathon">Marathon</a>’s announce-o-blaster continues firing with a newly unveiled set of PC system requirements. As seen on the Bungie FPS’s <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3065800/Marathon/">Steam page</a>, they’re nicely accommodating to cheapo rigs and older tech, though are missing any storage requirements.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>I wouldn’t bet on Marathon being much of an <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-ssd-for-gaming">SSD</a> muncher, though. Last year’s closed technical test barely bothered the scales with its 15GB download, and the fact that it only wants a 4GB Radeon RX 5500 XT as a minimum GPU suggests it’s not going to be stuffed to its hot pink robosuit seams with high-rez textures. Presumably none of which have been stolen, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bungie-used-an-artists-work-without-permission-in-marathon">anymore</a>. Full specs are as follows:</p>
<h3>Marathon minimum PC specs</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>OS:</strong> Windows 10 64-bit (latest Service Pack)</li>
<li><strong>CPU:</strong> Intel Core i5-6600 / AMD Ryzen 5 2600</li>
<li><strong>RAM:</strong> 8GB</li>
<li><strong>GPU:</strong> Nvidia GeForce GTX 1050 Ti (4GB) / AMD Radeon RX 5500 XT (4GB) / Intel Arc A580 (8GB, with ReBAR on)</li>
<li><strong>DirectX:</strong> Version 12</li>
<li><strong>Network:</strong> Broadband Internet connection</li>
</ul>
<h3>Marathon recommended PC specs</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>OS:</strong> Windows 10 64-bit (latest Service Pack)</li>
<li><strong>CPU:</strong> Intel Core i5-10400 / AMD Ryzen 5 3500</li>
<li><strong>RAM:</strong> 16GB</li>
<li><strong>GPU:</strong> Nvidia GeForce GTX 2060 (6GB) / AMD Radeon RX 5700 XT (8GB) / Intel Arc A770 (16GB, with ReBAR on)</li>
<li><strong>DirectX:</strong> Version 12</li>
<li><strong>Network:</strong> Broadband Internet connection</li>
</ul>
<p>And no, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/007-first-light-gets-updated-system-requirements-with-iois-apologies">there aren’t fictional processors in these ones</a>.</p>
<p>I like how Bungie have noted the need for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/what-is-resizable-bar-and-should-you-use-it">Resizable BAR</a> on Intel GPUs; a lot of modern PCs, especially prebuilts, will have this enabled already, but it serves to remind us of these budget cards’ most unusual quirk. It’s also nice to see a modern shooter keep its requirements down, in general; hopefully this in turn means MAXIMUM FRAMERATES GRRR ARGH for mightier PCs.</p><p>Not sure about the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-steam-deck-games">Steam Deck</a>, though. The sight of the GTX 1050 Ti in minimum specs is almost as reliable a shorthand for "Yes, this will run on tiny baby handheld hardware" as <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/valve-stress-again-that-therell-be-more-steam-machine-verified-games-than-steam-deck-ones-with-fewer-constraints-in-their-testing-programme">Valve’s own Verified programme</a>, but the real issue here is Marathon’s use of BattlEye anti-cheat. While this can work in harmony with SteamOS – <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/anticheat/vendor/battleye/">Gaming on Linux</a> have a handy game compatibility list – it currently doesn’t on Bungie’s <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/destiny-2">Destiny 2</a>, so Marathon is likely off the table as well.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Nintendo presidents past and present are in the news this week. One of 2025’s biggest blockbusters might finally have a Switch 2 release date again. And if you bought <em>Oblivion Remastered</em> and barely played it, you’re hardly alone. It’s the latest edition of Morning Checkpoint, <em>Kotaku</em>‘s daily roundup of gaming news, rumors, and culture.</p> <p>It’s currently <a href="https://kotaku.com/reviews/backlog">Backlog Week around these parts</a>. I spent the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday weekend playing a ridiculous amount of <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-game-pass-october-november-2025-powerwash-sim-2-2000638198"><em>Dome Keeper</em></a> with my kids. It came to Game Pass recently and is a clever little roguelite tower defense game that’s surprisingly hard to put down. The winter doldrums are ending this week, though. Lots of fresh 2026 releases are just around the corner.</p>

 <h2><em>Borderlands 4</em> seems slated to finally release on Switch 2 in February</h2> <p>A store listing on Portuguese site <em><a href="https://www.gamingreplay.com/pt/pre-reservas-nintendo-switch-2/32061-borderlands-4-game-key-card-switch-2-5026555072694.html">GamingReplay</a></em> (via <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/borderlands-4-switch-2-release-date/"><em>TheGamer</em></a>) states a release date of February 27, 2026 for the sci-fi sequel. That’s a Thursday, so that tracks. It also puts it after a potential February Nintendo Direct to perhaps remind everyone it’s still coming. The port was <a href="https://kotaku.com/borderlands-4-switch-2-delay-cross-save-performance-2000628055">indefinitely delayed</a> last fall as Gearbox Entertainment addressed performance issues with the PC version of the loot shooter.</p> <h2>It’s a good thing<em> The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered</em> didn’t charge by gameplay minute actually completed</h2> <p>Alinea Analytics’ <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/rhyselliott_my-ps5s-an-xbox-now-apparently-earlier-share-7417556440577470464-cl55/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rhys Elliot recently pointed out</a> (via <a href="https://frvr.com/blog/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered-sold-just-over-a-million-copies-on-ps5-but-50-of-gamers-played-just-15-hours-before-quitting/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>FRVR</em></a>) that while <em>Oblivion Remastered</em> sold over 1 million copies on PS5, about half of those buyers played less than 15 hours of the sprawling RPG. The Steam data is similarly stark. <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/oblivion-remastered-ps5-half-players-15-hours/">Per <em>TheGamer</em></a>, only 55 percent of PC players got the game’s first story quest achievement, only 11 percent entered the Shivering Isles, and only 7.5 percent completed the main quest.</p>

 <h2><em>Divinity: Original Sin 2</em> just had its best sales month in over 8 years</h2> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Sales for both BG3 and D:OS 2 have been incredible since the announcement of  Divinity. </p> <p>D:OS 2 really surprised us by having its best month since release in 2017.  Wish I’d removed the squirrel in time 🙂 <a href="https://t.co/fXTEUtuS7r">https://t.co/fXTEUtuS7r</a></p> <p>— Swen Vincke @where? (@LarAtLarian) <a href="https://twitter.com/LarAtLarian/status/2013481225030094906?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 20, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p>The announcement of <em>Divinity</em> in December spurred players to return to both<em> Baldur’s Gate 3</em> and the 2017 RPG. No doubt part of that was a big Switch 2 upgrade and a half-off sale.</p>

 <h2><em>World of Warcraft</em> veteran will work on Riot’s MMO</h2> <p>Blizzard producer Raymond Bartos has joined Riot Games (via <a href="https://massivelyop.com/2026/01/19/riot-games-unnamed-mmorpg-project-picks-up-a-former-world-of-warcraft-producer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-cy="styled-link"><em>MassivelyOP</em></a>). “I’m incredibly excited to be joining Riot on the MMO team!!!” he posted. “I’m deeply grateful for the opportunity to join such an inspiring group of people, and I can’t wait to get started — showing up every day to provide value for Riot gamers and help deliver an MMO experience players truly enjoy.” He’ll be back with past collaborator Orlando Salvatore and said he thinks the team will be “moving fast on day one.”</p> <h2>New <em>Fable</em> art work has surfaced</h2> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Fable | Concept Art<a href="https://t.co/OuQzqybQut">https://t.co/OuQzqybQut</a> <a href="https://t.co/ci23N0n0xW">pic.twitter.com/ci23N0n0xW</a></p> <p>— Klobrille (@klobrille) <a href="https://twitter.com/klobrille/status/2013499425688039483?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 20, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p>It looks very neat (via<em> <a href="https://mp1st.com/news/fable-rebootconcept-art-showcase-locations">MP1st</a></em>). Will it be a modern open-world RPG? Who knows. But hopefully at least some of the game’s scenes can match the promise of its concept art. Will it actually come out in 2026? I’m still skeptical.</p>

 <h2>A message from Nintendo of America’s new leader</h2> <p>Recently promoted veteran Devon Pritchard appeared in a video at the New York Game Awards to encourage the next generation of creators (via <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/nintendo-of-americas-new-president-devon-pritchard-makes-her-first-industry-appearance-since-taking-on-the-role/"><em>VGC</em></a>). “And remember, like any good video game character, you’re on an adventure, and every step you take matters,” she said. “There are some gnarly bosses, sure, but also many good friends along the way who will support you and powerful rewards for those who persevere. So, keep believing, keep playing, and know that you truly belong in this game.”</p> <h2>Doug Bowser joins Hasbro’s Board of Directors</h2> <p>The ex-Nintendo of America president <a href="https://newsroom.hasbro.com/news-releases/news-release-details/hasbro-announces-additions-board-directors">will now be part of the corporate governance team</a> overseeing the owner of <em>Magic: The Gathering</em>, <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em>, <em>Transformers</em>, and more. Is this the first step toward Nintendo doing a Universes Beyond <em>MTG</em> set? Probably not but I would, against my better judgement, buy the hell out of one.</p> <h2>ICYMI:</h2> <ul> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/cyberpunk-2077-vr-mod-baldurs-gate-3-takedown-2000660987">A<em> Cyberpunk 2077</em> VR mod has been nuked after its creator tried to charge people for it</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/assassins-creed-lawsuit-ubisoft-marc-alexis-cote-hexe-2000660833">The former head of <em>Assassin’s Creed</em> is suing Ubisoft over allegedly pushing him out of the company</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/i-cant-stop-flicking-coins-and-hiring-tiny-dudes-in-this-new-steam-game-2000660664">This coin-flicking indie game is surprisingly good</a></li> </ul> <h2>Watch this:</h2>

            <p>Hytale boss Simon Collins-Laflamme has called the Minecraft-like's recent early access launch "the most challenging but rewarding experience" of his life.</p>
<p>Hytale <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hytale-is-a-brand-new-game-from-giants-of-the-minecraft-community">started development in 2015</a> and soon began garnering a lot of attention. However, Riot Games, which <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/riot-games-snaps-up-studio-behind-promising-minecraft-like-sandbox-game-hytale">acquired Hytale developer Hypixel Studios in 2020</a>, opted to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/promising-minecraft-like-hytale-cancelled-after-ten-years-in-development">cancel the project last June</a>. Thankfully, though, Hytale was saved when Hypixel co-founder Collins-Laflamme <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hytale-is-saved-riot-sells-cancelled-minecraft-like-game-back-to-its-original-co-founder">successfully re-acquired the game from Riot</a> at the end of last year. Then, seven days ago, and after years of waiting, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hytale-launch-million-players">Hytale finally released in early access</a>.</p>

<p>Reflecting on the past week, Collins-Laflamme has now thanked the community for its support, and offered a "big thank you" to the "rebuilt Hytale team" for trusting him to get the game "to the finish line" in just a few months.</p>
<p>"I haven't been involved with Hytale development for many years and coming back was a big unknown and risk for me, and my family," Collins-Laflamme <a href="https://x.com/Simon_Hypixel/status/2013636980626595976">wrote on social media</a>. "I fully trusted the people and it just worked. Amazing team, every single one made a big difference."</p><p>Ahead of Hytale's release, Hypixel announced its Minecraft-alike <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/long-awaited-minecraft-a-like-hytale-has-already-sold-enough-to-fund-the-next-two-years-of-development-and-its-not-even-out-yet">had already sold enough copies to fund the next two years of development</a>. "Combined with my personal commitment of ten years," Collins-Laflamme said at the time, "we are looking very strong for the future."</p>

            <p>Raymond Bartos, producer on the World of Warcraft team, has announced his new role at a rival studio. He'll now be working on a whole new MMO, the much-anticipated and very mysterious Riot Games MMO no less.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7417390270268329984/">In a post on Bartos' Linkedin</a>, he wrote the following alongside a collection of pictures at Riot Games' LA office: "From my very first conversation with Riot, I immediately gravitated toward their values--and I was genuinely impressed by how clearly those values showed up throughout the interview process. It made it obvious that kindness, respect, and care aren't just words here, but something the team truly lives by.</p>
<p>"I'm deeply grateful for the opportunity to join such an inspiring group of people, and I can't wait to get started--showing up every day to provide value for Riot gamers and help deliver an MMO experience players truly enjoy."</p>

<p>Bartos was part of the team which shipped the popular Plunderstorm mode for World of Warcraft, as well as multiple limited-time remix modes and the game's 20th anniversary event. Bartos also noted he'll be working alongside one Orlando Salvatore, another former World of Warcraft veteran who jumped ship to Riot Games late last year.</p><p>There are in fact quite a few big names, formerly of Blizzard, that have ended up working on this MMO. Natalia Leenhardt was an 11-year alumni at the company before joining Amazon Game Studios in 2021 for New World, later joining the Riot Games MMO team in 2023. Kevin Carter joined Riot back in 2017 after over ten years at Blizzard, and of course the old executive producer on the Riot MMO Greg Street was a legendary World of Warcraft developer,<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/league-of-legends-mmo-producer-departing-riot-games"> though he left back in 2023</a>.</p>
<p>So what do we know about the Riot MMO? Not much! We know it's set in the Runeterra universe, like most of Riot Games' works are. We know the game had a "reset in direction" some years ago, and that there's been very little in the way of on-the-record discussion about it. That is, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mkyjsM31Epk">except for an interview with League lore content creator Necrit back in 2023</a>.</p>
<p>So there's been no word of any sort of reveal as of yet, nor any sort of timeline as to when we're likely to see it happen. Still, the continued hiring of staff is certainly a good indicator that serious work is being done.</p>
