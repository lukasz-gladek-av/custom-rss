			<p><a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/author-sues-bungie-for-copyright-infringement-over-destiny-2s-story">Last year</a>, writer Matthew Kelsey Martineau filed a copyright infringement lawsuit against Bungie, claiming that the studio had stolen his work to create the story for Destiny 2.</p>
<p>Martineau claimed that Destiny 2's Red Legion was pulled straight from his work, which was published on WordPress in 2013 and 2014. Bungie responded with a motion to dismiss the case, saying (per <a href="https://thegamepost.com/bungie-pushes-back-destiny-2-red-war-lawsuit/">TheGamePost</a>) that Martineau's claim "<em>failed to plausibly allege that Bungie copied constituent elements of Plaintiff's work that are original, and, specifically, that the Complaint fails to plausibly allege factual copying by Bungie and that the works incorporated by reference into the Complaint are not substantially similar as a matter of law</em>."</p>
<p>Demonstrating that has become an issue, however, as <a href="https://thegamepost.com/court-denies-bungie-dismiss-destiny-2-red-war-lawsuit-youtube-wiki/">TheGamePost</a> reports that the court denied Bungie's dismissal claim because Bungie cannot provide the court with the original content from Destiny 2 to demonstrate the differences between Bungie and Martineau's work. Bungie can't provide the court with Destiny 2's original content because it was <a href="https://wccftech.com/destiny-2-content-removed-vault-beyond-light-november/">vaulted</a>, and it's now incompatible with the modern-day version of Destiny 2.</p>
<p>Bungie game director Tyson Green described why Bungie can't provide the game's original content, clarifying that "<em>the 'Red War' and 'Curse of Osiris' legacy builds can no longer run because their outdated code is incompatible with Destiny 2's underlying operational framework, which has evolved considerably since the 'Red War' and 'Curse of Osiris' campaigns were retired</em>."</p>
<p>Unfortunately for Bungie, Green's statement wasn't enough for Judge Susie Morgan, who won't accept YouTube videos of the game's original content or wikis as admissible evidence.</p>
<p>"<em>While Plaintiff does reference Destiny 2 in his complaint</em>," Judge Morgan's dismissal decision reads, "<em>he does not reference the YouTube videos containing Destiny 2 game footage, the Destinypedia pages, or the Tyson declaration.</em>"</p>
<p>Judge Morgan acknowledged that this is an extremely complicated copyright case and not typical compared to previous examples of copyright infringement, which also seems to be part of why the case is moving forward at all.</p>
<p>Vaulting content has never been popular with Destiny players, and while Bungie certainly has its reasons for doing so, those decisions are seemingly coming back to bite them in more ways than just facing the ire of players.</p>

			<p>Grand Theft Auto V Enhanced Edition is undoubtedly the best-looking version of the open-world game developed by Rockstar Games, but this doesn't stop modders from taking the game's visuals to the next level.</p>
<p>A new 4K resolution video shared by Digital Dreams shows the latest version of the fifth entry in the series by Rockstar Games running with mods such as <a href="https://www.patreon.com/crxhvrd/home" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CoreFx</a> and <a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/lively-world-for-124497674">Lively World</a>, two known graphics and immersion improvement mods released for the original version of the game that were later ported to the Enhanced Edition. Needless to say, the two mods introduce noticeable enhancements that can make players forget the game initially released over a decade ago and possibly make the wait for the next entry in the series more bearable.</p>
<p><iframe title="[4K100] GTA 5 Enhanced: modded CoreFX - Lively World BeyondallLimits RTX5090 RAYTRACING Graphics" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/juHYo9QMU54?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Fans of the Rockstar Games series will have to make do with Grand Theft Auto V Enhanced Edition for a while longer to experience the best the series has to offer, as Grand Theft Auto VI will not release as initially scheduled. <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-launches-may-26/">Last week</a>, Rockstar confirmed the game will now release on May 26th, 2026, on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S, as the studio requires additional development time to deliver the level of quality fans expect. While the public was only informed of the delay last week, the fact that the game would slip to 2026 was known for a while at Rockstar Games, due in part to <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-reportedly-had-no-chance-of-releasing-in-2025-for-months-due-in-part-to-a-real-desire-to-avoid-crunch/">a real desire to avoid crunch</a>, which is commendable.</p>
<p>Grand Theft Auto V Enhanced Edition is now available on PC. You can learn more about how this new version of the game breathes new life into the popular open-world game by checking out Alessio's analysis.</p>

Nintendo specifically targets video ads for Switch 2 accessories that Genki released in April claiming day-one compatibility with the un-released hardware. </p><p>“Either Defendant is not in possession of a genuine console and thus cannot claim compatibility with enough certainty to make its advertising claims in good faith, or Defendant unlawfully or illicitly obtained an authentic Nintendo Switch 2, or proprietary technical information about the Nintendo Switch 2, prior to the console’s release to the public,” the complaint alleges.</p><p>Genki has remained undeterred in the face of the lawsuit, and plans to continue showing off its Switch 2 merchandize at upcoming events, like this week’s PAX East convention in Boston. “You may have seen that Nintendo recently filed a lawsuit against us,” it wrote in a statement <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/GenkiThings/status/1918852177046737231&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/GenkiThings/status/1918852177046737231" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">on May 3</a></span>. “We’re taking it seriously and working with legal counsel to respond thoughtfully.”<br></p><p>It continued:</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>What we can say is this: Genki has always been an independent company focused on building innovative gaming accessories for the community we love.

We’re grateful for the overwhelming support we’ve received so far. We’ll share more when we can, but for now, we’re staying focused on doing what we do best: building gear for gamers.</p></blockquote><p>It’s unclear if Nintendo still would have targeted Genki for its subsequent Switch 2 marketing campaign if it hadn’t pulled the CES stunt.

Of course, whether that was because it actually did have an early Switch 2, or because of the widespread leaks from <em>others</em> who had access, remains unclear. Either way, Nintendo is clearly not laughing. The company is demanding Genki “destroy” any products or ads that used its trademark, turn over any profits from related sales, and cease this kind of behavior in the future. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/clair-obscur-expedition-33-new-mod-allows-easy-configuration-of-additional-graphics-settings-for-better-visuals-and-performance.1181244/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-mod-additional-graphics-settings/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>A new Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 mod now available for download allows users to easily tweak additional graphics settings not available in-game without modifying engine configuration files directly.</p>
<p>The Expedition 33 - Unreal Config tool, created by Bighead and now available on <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/clairobscurexpedition33/mods/119?tab=description" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nexus Mods</a>, is a very handy tool that creates and configures engine configuration files for the game, allowing users to tweak additional graphics settings not available in-game to achieve better visuals, performance, or both. The tool, which is compatible with both the Steam and the Xbox Game Pass versions of the game, also comes with some built-in presets that can be selected as a base configuration to help users tweak these settings.</p>
<p>Though plenty of mods have been developed for the game, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 is absolutely enjoyable in its vanilla form, as it is one of the best role-playing games released in the past few years. With an incredibly compelling story, a charming cast of endearing characters, and excellent gameplay, the debut game from Sandfall Interactive is well worth experiencing, as I highlighted in my <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/clair-obscur-expedition-33-dont-fear-the-paintress/">review.</a></p>
<p><em>Before launch, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 looked like a solid yet safe role-playing game, but Sandfall Interactive’s debut shattered expectations in the best possible way. With a gripping story, a beautifully written cast of characters, and engaging gameplay that breathes new life into familiar mechanics, the game is a journey that leaves a lasting mark on both the mind and the heart.</em></p>
<p>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 is now available on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S worldwide.</p>

A new report states that only players who have purchased a battle pass for the FPS will have access to modes tied <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/cod-black-ops-6-squid-game-event-includes-red-light-green-light-operator-bundles-and-rewards/2900-6100/#1">to special events, like the Squid Game collaboration</a> earlier this year.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KC9Qz9edHJyjR5XCMy5slTzprus4SFSrq3CtSqnkEYc/edit?tab=t.0" rel="nofollow ">Call of Duty insider "The Ghost of Hope"</a> wrote <a href="https://x.com/TheGhostOfHope/status/1919060883696722210" rel="nofollow ">on X</a> that Activision is looking to "have more seasonal LTMs," but they will be locked behind the battle pass. Currently, all Call of Duty players have access to these events and modes, though people can buy a premium track pass to earn items and skins if they want. Apparently, this report states those premium tracks wouldn't exist starting with Call of Duty 2025.

This campaign is rumored to have four-player co-op and an open-world map.

                <p>A Minecraft Movie continues to soar at the box office, climbing above $870 million after about a month in theaters. This weekend, it faced new competition from Marvel's Thunderbolts* movie, and here's how the two films compared for their opening weekends in the US and globally.</p><p>Thunderbolts* made $76 million in the US for its opening weekend from May 2-4.  For comparison, A Minecraft Movie debuted on April 4 and made $162.7 million worldwide over its first weekend in the US alone. This past weekend was A Minecraft Movie's fifth weekend in theaters, and it made $13.7 million in the US. Movie theaters held "block party" screenings of the movie this weekend, during which <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/a-minecraft-movie-getting-a-theatrical-block-party-edition-inviting-viewers-to-basically-go-wild/1100-6531180/" data-ref-id="1100-6531180">attendees were encouraged to go wild.</a></p><p>Thunderbolts* made $162.1 million worldwide for its opening weekend, compared to $301 million for A Minecraft Movie.</p><p>According to <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/thunderbolts-box-office-solid-opening-1236206794/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Hollywood Reporter</a>, $76 million in the US for Thunderbolts* was "slightly ahead" of expectations, with the report noting that Thunderbolts* featuring relatively lesser-known characters might have factored in to the movie's performance so far.</p><p>Thunderbolts* reportedly had a production budget of $180 million, compared to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/06/business/a-minecraft-movie-box-office.html" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">$150 million for A Minecraft Movie.</a></p><p>A Minecraft Movie is the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/highest-grossing-video-game-movies-of-all-time/2900-3968/" data-ref-id="2900-3968">No. 2 highest-grossing video game movie of all time</a>, only trailing The Super Mario Bros. Movie ($1.3 billion). Another video game movie is currently in theaters, too, as Sony's Until Dawn movie has now earned <a href="https://www.boxofficemojo.com/title/tt30955489/?ref_=bo_se_r_1" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">$34.8 million worldwide</a> against a reported $15 million budget.</p><p>Unsurprisingly, Warner Bros. is reportedly <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/a-minecraft-movie-2-sounds-like-a-sure-thing/1100-6530854/" data-ref-id="1100-6530854">close to announcing A Minecraft Movie 2.</a></p>

			<p>Chief executive officer of Lords of the Fallen studio CI Games, Marek Tyminski, claims that he has data proving "'<em>modern audience' is a false myth.</em>'"</p>
<p>On his personal<a href="https://x.com/tyminski_marek/status/1918051654336684343"> X account</a>, Tyminski wrote, "'<em>Modern audience' is a false myth. Data prove it now. Making games for them is a path to extinction.</em>" It's the latest seemingly culture war-related post from Tyminski, who commonly engages with and reposts statements from other culture war grifters online.</p>
<p>Previously, Tyminski has <a href="https://x.com/tyminski_marek/status/1906468008354062627">claimed</a> "<em>Video games have gotten way too political</em>" and that this alleged change is "<em>Not good for the industry. My company won't be part of it. Bad for gamers, bad for shareholders, and bad for talent</em>." Earlier this year,<a href="https://wccftech.com/lords-of-the-fallen-studio-dei/"> CI Games stated</a> that the studio would not integrate elements of DEI into its games moving forward.</p>
<p>He doesn't follow up his post with any kind of data or research into his claim, though it's possible he's referring to the <a href="https://x.com/tyminski_marek/status/1878494267762520464">polls on X he's conducted</a> on topics like whether players want to choose between body type's A/B or if they'd prefer the option say male/female.</p>
<p>Recently, Lords of the Fallen released a major 2.0 update that <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/lords-of-the-fallen-frustration-your-side/">Wccftech's reviewer</a> notes is a <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-lords-of-the-fallen-2-0-is-a-massive-improvement-over-the-launch-version/">"<em>massive</em>"</a> improvement on the game compared to the state it launched in. Which included making Lords of the Fallen a more forgiving game to help acclimate new players when they first step into Lords of the Fallen, with modifiers provided to allow players to ramp the difficulty back up, if they choose to do so.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hundred-line-last-defense-academy-ps5-xbox-unlikely<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>If you've been holding your breath for&nbsp;Kazutaka Kodaka and Kotaro Uchikoshi's JRPG&nbsp;<em>The Hundred Line: Last Defense Academy&nbsp;</em>to hit other platforms, then it's probably safe to let that breath out, unfortunately.</p>

<p>That's according to a post by Kodaka on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/kazkodaka.bsky.social/post/3loblywautc2f" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Bluesky</a>, in which he says that there are "no plans" to bring the JRPG to other platforms. Not only that, but the chances of that happening in the future are "very slim", according to Kodaka.</p>

<p>Kodaka's post was in response to <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/ethangarcia.bsky.social/post/3lnapnme7ms2n" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">a user</a> who asked how long a port might take if&nbsp;<em>The Hundred Line&nbsp;</em>is successful, as well as whether other translations might become available in time. Kodaka says he'd "love to get started" on localizations, but that his studio Too Kyo Games is "still on the brink of going under".</p>

For that reason, he says he'll share updates about future plans "when the time comes", encouraging players to enjoy the game "without any worries".</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>The Hundred Line: Last Defense Academy</em>, it's a tactical RPG co-authored by Kotaro Uchikoshi and Kazutaka Kodaka, the creators of the&nbsp;<em>Zero Escape&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Danganronpa&nbsp;</em>franchises respectively.</p>

<p>Released <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/the-hundred-line-last-defense-academy-release-date" rel="nofollow">last month</a>, the game's development saw Too Kyo Games <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/danganronpa-creators-new-game-risking-lives" rel="nofollow">indebted as a result of securing financing</a>, so Uchikoshi and Kodaka will no doubt be hoping that&nbsp;<em>The Hundred Line&nbsp;</em>is a success.</p>

<p>At time of writing, the game's player count is sitting at 8,200, with a 24-hour peak of 9,053 and an all-time high of 10,026. Those are some pretty respectable numbers for a very niche JRPG, but whether they're enough to save Too Kyo is another matter.</p>




<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>The Hundred Line: Last Defense Academy&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3014080/The_Hundred_Line_Last_Defense_Academy/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/the-hundred-line-last-defense-academy-switch/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch</a>. A free demo for the game is also available on both platforms if you'd like to try it out before making a purchase.</p>

                <p>Earlier this month, Fallout creator Tim Cain noted that the source code for the original Fallout and Fallout 2 was lost and thought to be destroyed. But that has turned out to not be the case. Interplay co-founder Rebecca Heineman has revealed that they saved the source code for both games and other titles that the company worked on. But that required defying orders to destroy them.</p><p>Heineman told <a href="https://www.videogamer.com/news/fallout-1-fallout-2-source-code-isnt-actually-not-lost-reveals-former-interplay-founder/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">VideoGamer</a> that they began archiving the source codes for Interplay's games in 1993 after realizing that the company had lost the code for Wasteland and wasn't keeping an archive of its older titles. Heineman recovered Wasteland's code from a source at EA and took up a personal quest to preserve Interplay's gaming heritage.</p><p>"I made it a quest to snapshot everything and archive it on CD-ROMs," said Heineman. "When I left Interplay in 1995, I had copies of every game we did. No exceptions. When I did MacPlay, which existed beyond my tenure at Interplay, every game we ported, I snapshotted. It included Fallout 1 and 2."</p><p>Heineman went on to explain that Interplay had given standing orders to destroy the property of everyone who left the company, which would apply to them as well. However, Heineman noted that they kept everything in defiance of that order and that the source codes for Fallout 1 and 2 are safely stored on "M-Disc Blu-Rays for long term storage."</p><p>Although the source codes for the first two Fallout games are secure, Heineman can't release them without permission from Bethesda. Heineman intends to ask the company for their approval at some point but hasn't gotten around to it yet.</p><p>According to a recent report, a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/there-is-a-fallout-3-remaster-in-the-works-but-its-not-arriving-anytime-soon-report/1100-6530903/" data-ref-id="1100-6530903">Fallout 3 remaster is coming</a> in the future.

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/call-of-duty-limited-time-modes-paywalls-rumor</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/call-of-duty-might-soon-hide-limited-time-modes-behind-paywalls.1181157/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/call-of-duty-limited-time-modes-paywalls-rumor<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A new report has emerged which suggests that&nbsp;Activision and Treyarch are considering putting some of the next&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty&nbsp;</em>game's limited-time modes behind a paywall.</p>

<p>According to&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty&nbsp;</em>leaker <a href="https://x.com/TheGhostOfHope/status/1919060883696722210" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">The Ghost of Hope</a>, the next game (which, in a break from tradition, will apparently be&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</em>) will have more seasonal limited-time modes, but "the only way to play [them] will be to have the battle pass".</p>

<p>Right now, anyone can enjoy&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty</em>'s seasonal limited-time modes regardless of whether they pick up the battle pass or not, but under these proposed changes, it seems you'd need to pay up for the privilege.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/call-of-duty-limited-time-modes-paywall-jay-silent-bob.jpg?itok=hlW83aKO 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/call-of-duty-limited-time-modes-paywall-jay-silent-bob.jpg?itok=pmEKbaNH 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Some of&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty</em>'s future crossovers could be behind paywalls.</figcaption></figure><p>The Ghost of Hope says that Activision and Treyarch, who will be developing the game, are "planning on taking the higher tier skins, loot, and crossover operators" obtained through limited-time game modes and "making them only accessible to battle pass owners".</p>

<p>According to Hope, purchasing any paid battle pass for&nbsp;<em>Black Ops 7&nbsp;</em>will get you access to the limited-time game modes under the new system, although premium-tier Blackcell pass would probably get a little something extra.</p>

<p>It is worth noting that the next&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty&nbsp;</em>game hasn't officially been unveiled yet, so this information should definitely be taken with a pinch of salt. Given Activision's eagerness to monetize <i>Call of Duty</i>, though, as well as its many high-profile crossovers, it wouldn't surprise me if limited-time event monetization is on the cards.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/call-of-duty-limited-time-modes-paywall-rumor-turtles.jpg?itok=0SDRRtbG 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/call-of-duty-limited-time-modes-paywall-rumor-turtles.jpg?itok=YK5Emw0F 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Call of Duty&nbsp;</em>has crossed over with a number of high-profile properties.</figcaption></figure><p><em>Call of Duty</em>'s major high-profile crossovers include the likes of&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/call-of-duty-squid-game-crossover" rel="nofollow"><em>Squid Game</em></a>,&nbsp;<em>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles</em>, and&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/warhammer-40k-skins-coming-to-call-of-duty-warzone-and-cod-modern-warfare-3" rel="nofollow"><em>Warhammer 40k</em></a>, and while not all of the crossovers arrive with limited-time modes, many do, meaning these crossovers could end up behind paywalls in future.</p>

<p>We'll have to wait and see what Activision has in store for the next&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty&nbsp;</em>to find out whether this leak is true or not. If the timing of<em>&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-revealed" rel="nofollow">Black Ops 6</a></em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-revealed" rel="nofollow">'s announcement</a> is anything to go by, we can probably expect a reveal for the next game in the series in summer.</p>

Due to the film’s popularity, it will be re-released in IMAX from May 15th until May 21st, but until then, we have created a list of films and shows that you can watch if you still need a bit of a horror or southern gothic stories in your life. In this list, you will definitely find something to keep you entertained and maybe a little bit spooked!</p><p><em>This story originally appeared on The Root, our sister site, on Sunday, May 4.</em></p></div></div><div><p>If you want more Black vampires, then Blacula might be the film for you. Dracula [Charles Macaulay] turns an African prince, Prince Mamuwalde [William Marshall], into a vampire and traps him in a coffin. But chaos ensues when Prince Mamuwalde wakes up two centuries later and winds up in 1970s LA.</p></div><div><p>Jordan Peele’s first film “Get Out,” is a movie that will have you clutching at your pearls! Chris [Daniel Kaluuya] is an African-American man dating a white woman, Rose [Allison Williams]. Things start to take a spine-chilling turn when he goes to meet her creepy family for the first time.</p></div><div><p>This 2008 drama is not very Black, though the series had memorial black characters and is filled with Vampires. In this show, Vampires struggle for equal rights to live amongst non-vampires, while anti-vampire organizations grow in popularity. So, what happens when Sookie Stackhouse [Anna Paquin] falls in love with a 174-year-old vampire and has to deal with the difficulties of their relationship?</p></div><div><p>Interview With The Vampire is centered around the life of Louis de Pointe du Lac [Jacob Anderson] as he recounts his life story to journalist Daniel Molloy [Eric Bogosian]. The show based on a popular book by Anne Rice  is spooky, sexy, and intense. </p></div><div><p>Based on the Octavia Butler novel, Kindred follows Dana [Mallori Johnson] who gets pulled back in time to a nineteenth-century plantation where she is summoned to save Rufus, [David Alexander Kaplan] the white son of the plantation owner. The series follows Dana as she tries to understand what is happening to her and why.</p></div><div><p>If you like the idea of horror mixed with religion then Midnight Mass might be what you’re looking for. After a charismatic young priest shakes up the life of an isolated community, frightening events begin to occur. This film will have you on the edge of your seat.</p></div><div><p>Based on the Stephen King novel, Salem’s Lot follows Ben Mears [Lewis Pullman] on his return to his childhood home as he looks for inspiration for his next book, but what he discovers is much spookier than he could’ve imagined.</p></div><div><p>On the run from the police, brothers Richard Gecko [Quentin Tarantino] and Seth Gecko [George Clooney] film themselves running into a gang of vampires who are out for blood!</p></div><div><p>In this spine-chilling series, a plague starts to spread across humanity that leaves people acting like vampires. Dr Ephraim Goodweather [Corey Stoll] is called to investigate what is happening and figure out how to stop it.</p></div><div><p>Eve [Jurnee Smollet] finds out that her perfect father is hiding illicit affairs. After growing increasingly frustrated with her father’s actions, Eve seeks out a voodoo curse to be set on her father. The film is very spiritual and heartbreaking as you watch the hardships of this Creole-American family.</p></div><div><p>According to an interview <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.instagram.com/reel/DIiSKyTpdv3/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DIiSKyTpdv3/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Coogler did with Proximity Media</a></span>, “The Thing” was one of the films that inspired the way Sinners was shot. Coogler even has a poster of the film in his office. This 80's sci-fi horror follows a group of researchers in Antarctica as they deal with an alien that takes on the form of its victims.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Jennifer Svedberg-Yen responded to one of his Reddit posts asking for voice actors, and she was cast as a major character initially. But then she transitioned to serving as the lead writer for Clair Obscur: Expedition 33. Meanwhile, Broche plucked composer Lorien Testard from Bandcamp, even though the musician didn't have any background working on video games. "We have, I think, an amazing team mostly of junior people, but they are so incredibly invested in the project and talented," said Broche.</p><p dir="ltr">Obviously, the rest is history, as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-past-and-present-of-fantasy-rpgs-just-had-amazing-weekends-on-pc-and-console/1100-6531155/">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 came out a couple of weeks ago and quickly sold 1 million copies</a>.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-horror-at-highrook-is-a-mysterious-card-based-investigation-game-and-also-there%E2%80%99s-a-cat.1181136/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/horror-at-highrook-impressions<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>For years I owned this huge illustrated Lovecraft book that I knew I should get rid of but which I struggled to finally take out to the curb: not from any attachment to the works themselves, but because the weight of the book made it perfect for pressing tofu. But I’m often curious about how works inspired by Lovecraft deal with questions of mythos and knowledge, which made recent indie card-based game <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2836860/The_Horror_at_Highrook/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>The Horror At Highrook</em></a> intriguing.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="The Horror At Highrook - Release Trailer" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/drjG1Pj8HGE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p><em>Highrook</em> is, thankfully, only Lovecraftian in the sense of having cosmic beings and groups devoted to them, but in my time with its first three chapters has had more of a Victorian horror vibe in the form of people going into a grand house they should totally not be going into. You play as four investigators hired to unravel the mysterious disappearance of the wealthy Ackeron family, and you quickly learn that what seemed like a domestic issue involves the occult. Each of your characters has skills specific to their role, and those skills align with certain rooms of the Highrook manor. Astor is a mechanic who can tinker with items in the machine room; scholar Vitali is suited for research tasks in study and archives; Atticus Hawk is fit for physical tasks in the courtyard and cliffs; and Doctor Caligar can craft potions in the laboratory. Characters also have skills that align with other rooms: I found Astor best suited to cooking meals in the kitchen, while Hawk was useful for exploring the manor’s cellar.&nbsp;</p><p>Each room of the manor has a slot for a task card–a mysterious box to open, a code to break, a book to read–and a slot for one person to do that task. You need a certain amount of points in the room’s skill to be successful; if your character doesn’t have the base attributes, you can bolster them with additional cards representing items you can find or craft. While the early game felt like it started a little slow, with a bit of waiting for the right items to boost my stats or move the plot to appear, in my later play I’ve found myself with plenty to do, multitasking around the investigation while juggling my characters’ light survival needs for food and sleep. <em>Highrook</em> has often taken on the feeling of a cooperative board game, even though it’s just me playing: Hawk searching for useful items, Caligar crafting potions to boost Astor’s stats so she can unlock a code to open a new room, Vitali researching mysterious tomes found in the last box Atticus dug up.&nbsp;</p><p>The game so far has been somewhat linear, with certain plot items appearing rather than me moving the story forward on my own. Many of those plot threads have involved finding enough pieces of an occult symbol to unlock the next story bit about what precisely Lord Ackeron was dealing with. The writing has been a little heavy-handed at times, but it’s teased a compelling picture of how Lord Ackeron’s occult obsession affected his family, who are more than just foils to his pursuits. Your investigators also have their own conflicts and motivations, and I’ve enjoyed the tension of deciding whether I should use my stat-boosting items on the main quest or on their side quests, eager to learn more about them.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>The symbol you piece together. (Nullpointer Games)</figcaption></figure><p>In addition to the big bads you’re pursuing, there are also smaller creepy beings around the mansion. In the early game there’s been a ghost that hops from room to room, raising the madness level of anyone it comes in contact with. I’ve had to fight beings unleashed from performing an arcane ritual in the chapel, matching the points in the room they appear to banish them back to the void. In my first encounter with these beings I found fighting them in the machine room my best bet, and I’d hurry to move my character cards from other rooms they appeared in to avoid their negative effects. Besting them unlocked items I could use to level up my investigors, making them more than just a nuisance. There’s also been a cat who wanders the grounds, sometimes taking up a character card slot and forcing me to wait to do a room’s task until he decides to move, just like a real cat.</p><p>As you can imagine, your board in <em>Highrook</em> quickly becomes cluttered with cards, though the game provides storage space where you can organize your items. Information isn’t always quite as clear as I’d like–I sometimes had to click through piles of cards to remember which one I needed, or cycle through my investigators to remember all their skills–but overall the game does its best to tame its chaos, and I always knew how to find the information I needed. The game also keeps your characters’ meters for hunger, fatigue, health and sanity clearly displayed, so when I was suddenly informed that a character was exhausted and had to be sent to the guest room and its sleep-inducing item to recover, I knew it was my own time management that had caused the situation rather than the game not warning me what I was headed for.</p><p>I’ve quickly been sucked into <em>Highrook</em>’s story and world, and I’ve found its linearity to be a good offset to the potential overwhelm of tasks and cards. I have tons of rooms of the manor left to unlock, and I’m excited to play more. If you’re looking for a cards-and-rooms game that isn’t <a href="https://aftermath.site/blue-prince-real-ending" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>The Horror At Blue Prince</em></a>, <em>Highrook</em> is out now, and has a demo on Steam if you want to get a feel for it.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

					</p></div><div>
							<h5>Platform</h5><p><span>PC, PS5, Xbox Series X/S, PS4</span>

						</p></div></div></div>			
			<p>If you've been following Raccoon Logic in anticipation of Revenge of the Savage Planet coming out, then you're probably already aware of the journey the studio has been through to get here.</p>
<p>Founded in Montreal in 2017 as an independent team under the name Typhoon Studios and acquired two years later by Google, Typhoon would end up being hit by the collateral damage caused by Google not knowing what to do with Stadia. When <a href="https://wccftech.com/google-stadia-first-party-teams-shut-down-jade-raymond-leaves/">Stadia was shuttered</a>, Typhoon went with it.</p>
<p>And, as we've seen before in video games, it didn't matter that their first game, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/journey-to-the-savage-planet/">Journey to the Savage Planet</a>, was a hit. At least, it didn't matter to Google. Typhoon Studios quickly became <a href="https://wccftech.com/journey-to-the-savage-planet-dev-reforms-raccoon-logic-sequel/">Raccoon Logic</a>, and years after those events, it feels like the team didn't lose a step in all of it. More than that, it feels like Raccoon Logic picked up an edge with Revenge of the Savage Planet.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Journey-To-The-Savage-Planet-Screenshot-2025.05.05-00.34.07.10.png"></a></figure>

<p>The studio's ordeal with Google heavily influenced the tone of this sequel, which takes every opportunity to poke fun at corporate culture and the machinations of giant corporations. Right off the top of the game, when you land on an unknown planet, an enthused new employee of Alta Interglobal, the giant conglomerate that acquired your previous employer, Kindred Technologies, you learn that you're actually an enthused former employee of Alta Interglobal.</p>
<p>You and every other Kindred Aerospace employee were laid off while you were on your way to a planet in some backwater corner of space. You're stranded and are forced to make do with the bits of technology and everything else that Alta left behind. The message is not lost in the science-fiction of it all when Alta directly tells you that you, and the rest of the technology you have at your disposal, were left behind because it was too costly to send a ship out to get you.</p>
<p>And that's just how the game starts. As it evolves, Raccoon Logic doesn't pull any punches, and Revenge of the Savage Planet is a better game for it.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Journey-To-The-Savage-Planet-Screenshot-2025.05.01-22.57.38.91.png"></a></figure>

<p>The absurdist commercials for products that are most certainly killing their customers or the ads for the galaxy's biggest influencer, Shama Lama Ding-Dong and his Ding-Dong Academy, which is 'guaranteed' to make you the next biggest influencer alive, all hit the right notes for me. I appreciated how Raccoon Logic walked the line in these ads and within the messages from Alta, or any other corporate caricatures, between hyperbole and something you'd believe could happen tomorrow.</p>
<p>Which is great, because the story didn't connect with me beyond that. The jokes were great, and the commentary felt sharp, but it didn't feel like it had anything behind it.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Journey-To-The-Savage-Planet-Screenshot-2025.05.04-13.28.24.26.png"></a></figure>

<p>There wasn't a strong emotional core to hold it all together or give it any punch, which isn't the worst thing in the world. Revenge of the Savage Planet is more about its satire and providing a solid gameplay experience. It's successful at that, for the most part. Its early hours are, however, annoyingly tedious in a way that I know would have turned me off the game entirely if I hadn't been playing this for a review.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Journey-To-The-Savage-Planet-Screenshot-2025.05.03-20.25.41.26.png"></a></figure>

<p>If there's any advice I can give someone looking to jump into Revenge of the Savage Planet, it would be to do your best to golden-path your way through the game until you've acquired a few key upgrades. After that, the whole gameplay experience opens up in a much more engaging way, but before that, it still feels annoying to gain some momentum on a quest and in the story, shallow as it is, only for it to grind to a halt because you need to get a different upgrade.</p>
<p>It's not that I'm completely against the Metroid structure of needing to come back to an area when you have the right equipment. When that kind of game pacing works, it works because there's a period halfway through the game where I know I'm not fully kitted out, but I feel like I can take on the game's toughest challenges. Where I've found a satisfying flow to the gameplay, and have moved past the underpowered underdog feeling that the game opens with.</p>
<p>That middle ground doesn't really exist in Revenge of the Savage Planet. I felt underpowered for the majority of the game, and it wasn't until nearing one of the game's three endings that I started to feel like I had solid options for how I could approach a situation, whether that's combat, exploration, or platforming. It's unfortunate that the pacing and often tedious tasks you're asked to complete to progress dampen the experience right up to the end.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Journey-To-The-Savage-Planet-Screenshot-2025.05.01-22.21.25.93.png"></a></figure>

<p>Where it Revenge of the Savage Planet shines, is in the level design across the four core planets you'll visit, the creature designs, the animations, the audio work with each fire of your blaster and the soundscape of every new biome on each of the planets you'll stomp across, and the visual design of each planet. The boss fights are also solid spectacles that were welcome breaks in the gameplay to change things up for a few minutes.</p>
<p>The platforming challenges and environmental puzzles were also quite enjoyable, even if the floaty-jumping of the former took some getting used to. The combat wasn't anything to write home about, but by the time you're able to take advantage of the environmental systems at play on each planet, leaning into those systems can allow you to create a lot of your own fun. If you try to use your blaster for every situation, not only will it not work most of the time, but you'll bore yourself away from playing Revenge of the Savage Planet ever again.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Journey-To-The-Savage-Planet-Screenshot-2025.05.04-11.54.13.36.png"></a></figure>

<p>It's every whimsical step you take and every oddball animation you see that keep you from quitting out of Revenge of the Savage Planet, and make you want to keep searching for the next upgrade. The game survives on its charm and satire, and on the gameplay still feeling good, after you put in the time to get the necessary upgrades.</p>
<p>Speaking of upgrades, I did not expect Revenge of the Savage Planet to have me very seriously thinking the whole way through that I should upgrade my PC sooner than I planned. Even at medium settings, and Racoon Logic's recommended GPU, an RTX 2060, I never went very long without some kind of framerate hitch, or full freezes for a second or longer. My PC isn't anything special, it's a very modest build, but I still have had better experiences with modern games than with Revenge of the Savage Planet.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Journey-To-The-Savage-Planet-Screenshot-2025.05.01-22.11.10.17.png"></a></figure>

<p>I also consistently ran into UI bugs, where I had to close and re-open the journal and map because they stopped working. I even ran into an issue where the surprise launch addition of the Dave the Diver outfit was entirely missing when I loaded into the game. It took two restarts for it to reappear, which, again, isn't the biggest issue in the world. But it was yet another technical issue on top of the constant technical issues that plagued my entire time with Revenge of the Savage Planet.</p>
<p>It's not unplayable by any stretch, or at least it's not in this state, so even if the day-one patch can't solve all these issues, you won't be jumping into an entirely broken game. Just be aware that there's still a few touch-ups that the game clearly needs.</p>
<p>Ultimately, Revenge of the Savage Planet is a fun mix of sharp satire and toilet humor, with a layer of environmental systems that do work well together, once you have the upgrades to manipulate and use them all. It thrives mostly due to the charm, care, and whimsy pumped into its design and nearly every aspect, but it lacks any narrative chops to push it further. Tedious missions and a poorly executed gameplay arc dampen the experience, potentially to the point where I wouldn't blame you for putting it down.</p>

<p>But if you're charmed by the parts of Revenge of the Savage Planet that are working overtime to charm you, then it's worth sticking around for what can be a fun romp. Especially if you have a friend by your side, as it's easy to see how much more fun it would be to play this game in co-op.</p>

				<p>Revenge of the Savage Planet is a fun mix of sharp satire and toilet humor, with whimsical and cartoon-y animations, character designs, and smart level design that strengthens the gameplay experience when it opens up to you fully. The problem, is getting to that point, with tedious missions and upgrade pacing that halt any momentum it starts to build, and with it lacking a story with any real punch, if the charm isn't working for you, it's unlikely, and understandable, if you don't stick around long enough for it to start clicking.</p>

		<p>Daemon X Machina: Titanic Scion is going to be release on September 5th, Marvelous has announced alongside a new trailer. The new trailer has been released to show off the combat mechanics that will be present in Daemon X Machina: Titanic Scion, including how to exploit weaknesses and the different types of weapons that can be equipped.</p>
<p><iframe title="Daemon X Machina: Titanic Scion | Combat Basics" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-QNs0jh_Z5k?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The Arsenal’s in Daemon X Machina: Titanic Scion can equipped up to six pieces of equipment including a shoulder mounted weapon, an auxiliary, a left weapon, a right weapon, and two side weapons. The weapon types are medium range rifles, blades for close quarter combat, bazookas for long range attacks that can do high damage, bows that can target weak points, and for groups of enemies you can use missiles and railguns. Auxiliary’s are used as support items to help in battle, and the gameplay has been designed to allow switching between weapons with ease.</p>
<p>Before engaging in a battle, players can scan enemies to find their weaknesses. For example, enemies that have have a hard exterior are more susceptible to laser damage while soft exterior enemies have a weakness to physical weapons. When in combat, players can use knockdown and grab attacks to tear off armour to expose weak areas.</p>
<h2><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/09/11/daemon-x-machina-review/">Daemon X Machina Review</a></h2>
<p>In our Daemon X Machina review, Miguel said,<em> “Daemon X Machina sets the bar for robot action games. The addictive mecha fighting is almost flawless, but it’s complemented by so many other incredible parts to the game. There’s a rich, unique world filled with incredible and memorable characters, endless and addictive customisation, gorgeous visuals and a jaw-dropping soundtrack. Daemon X Machina rarely stumbles, and even when it did, I still couldn’t help but be impressed by this amazing new experience.”</em></p>

<p>Daemon X Machina: Titanic Scion is going to be release on September 5th for PC, PS5, Xbox Series XS, and Switch 2.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-genki-switch-2-lawsuit<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nintendo is suing accessory maker Genki over the latter's "Glitch 2" Switch 2 accessory range, alleging trademark infringement and false advertising under federal and California state law.</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://thegamepost.com/nintendo-lawsuit-against-genki-switch-2-mockups-ces-2025/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">The Game Post</a>, Nintendo's lawsuit, which was filed last week, claims Genki used Nintendo's "Switch" and "Joy-Con" trademarks in order to make it seem as though the accessory company's products were approved by Nintendo.</p>

<p>This, according to Nintendo's lawsuit, included the demonstration of what Genki claimed to be accurate Switch 2 mockups at the CES 2025 trade show, which took place prior to the console's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-officially-announced" rel="nofollow">official announcement in January</a>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/genki-glitch-2-accessories-nintendo-lawsuit.jpg?itok=nIE3RlrZ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/genki-glitch-2-accessories-nintendo-lawsuit.jpg?itok=_blZoz9b 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Genki is currently advertising accessories for the "Glitch 2", and I'm sure you know what they're really intended for.</figcaption></figure><p>In the lawsuit, Nintendo goes on to say that Genki's semi-April Fools' Day joke, which saw it holding a suspiciously Nintendo Direct-style showcase in which it revealed a range of accessories for the so-called "Glitch 2", was an "obvious reference" to the Switch 2.</p>

<p>The Japanese gaming giant says that Genki's claims of compatibility on "day one" for the Glitch 2 range was misleading and illegal, because Nintendo hadn't provided Genki with a Switch 2 prior to release.</p>

<p>This means the accessory maker either wasn't in "possession of a genuine console" and thus couldn't make claims of compatibility "in good faith", or said console (or information pertaining to its specs) was "unlawfully or illicitly obtained".</p>

<p>Nintendo also says Genki's use of its trademarks would make it likely consumers would "falsely perceive a connection, association, sponsorship, or affiliation" between the two companies where no such partnership exists.</p>




<p>As for what Nintendo wants from the lawsuit, it's asking the court to put a stop to Genki selling Switch 2-related accessories. In The Game Post's words, it wants Genki to "destroy any products or ads that use Nintendo trademarks", as well as handing over profits related to Switch 2 accessory sales.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/grand-theft-auto-6s-delay-just-affected-the-entire-video-game-industry<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Grand Theft Auto fans, there is some good news and some bad news. The good news is finally, after all these years, we have an actual day-and-date release time for GTA 6. The bad news? It’s around six months later than the ‘Fall 2025’ we were originally told. To many in the video game industry, the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gta-6-delayed-to-may-2026">new date of May 26, 2026</a> is a welcome sigh of relief – dozens of publishers and developers of all sizes were fearful of meticulously planning their release campaigns  only to later discover they’d be releasing in the same month as this herculean title. However, there are many undated heavy-hitters due to land next year that will now be frantically searching for a new date. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">What’s clear is that Grand Theft Auto 6 has found itself touted as the lynchpin to the video game industry’s near future – any news on the project’s development has a huge ripple effect. So how does a six-month delay reflect a significant change in Rockstar’s corporate culture, call into question this year’s console market revenue, and potentially affect the Switch 2?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Last year, the video game industry’s total revenue hit $184.3 billion, a 0.2% increase from 2023. Contradicting analyst <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-and-switch-2-will-help-video-game-industry-rebound-in-2025-analyst-predicts/1100-6526016/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">predictions </a>of a slight downturn, it prompted a sigh of relief for video game manufacturers and publishers. However, in the console space, revenue dropped by 1% – and we’re already seeing the consequences. A downturn of console hardware sales combined with a heightening technology tariff war has forced prices up for both <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-raises-the-price-of-all-xbox-series-consoles-xbox-games-confirmed-to-hit-80-this-holiday">Microsoft </a>and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-ps5-is-getting-more-expensive-in-europe-australia-and-new-zealand-again">Sony</a>. This generation needs a definitive console-shifting title – it needs Grand Theft Auto 6. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Research groups estimate the crime sequel to make $1 billion off pre-orders alone and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gta-6-projected-to-make-over-3-billion-in-its-first-year-on-sale">$3.2 billion in its first year of launch</a>. It took Grand Theft Auto 5 three days to make $1 billion, could it take Grand Theft Auto 6 just 24 hours? Circana analyst Mat Piscatella believes that <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/2024-game-spending-down-2-is-circana-analysts-most-optimistic-outlook" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">“there’s probably never been a more important thing to ever release in the industry,”</a> because the game’s impact will help define our understanding of the video game industry’s potential growth over the next decade. There are rumors that it could be the first-ever $100 video game, making it a new watershed moment for the industry. That new benchmark could give the industry the shot-in-the-arm growth many analysts say it needs. However, it’s also possible Grand Theft Auto 6 is simply too much of a monolithic outlier to create progress outside of itself.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In 2018, Rockstar Games had a publicity crisis on its hands. Reports of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2018/10/15/rockstar-exec-clarifies-statement-about-red-dead-redemption-2s-several-100-hour-weeks">100 hour weeks</a> alongside <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2018/10/19/in-wake-of-red-dead-2-crunch-discussion-rockstar-office-now-explicitly-told-overtime-is-optional">formerly mandatory overtime</a> whilst developing Red Dead Redemption 2, plus former and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2018/10/18/rockstar-grants-permission-for-developers-to-talk-about-working-conditions">current employees</a> speaking on intense crunch periods stemming from Grand Theft Auto 4, painted a stark picture of one of gaming’s titans. Since then, the company has reportedly undergone an internal reinvention of sorts – according to a <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-07-27/gta-6-release-date-rockstar-cleans-up-image-after-employee-backlash" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bloomberg report</a>, contractors being converted to full-time employees and a ‘flexitime’ policy enabling workers to take time off for every hour of overtime worked are just two of the many more compassionate policies enacted. Earlier this year, Rockstar’s old reputation threatened to rear its head as staff were made to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gta-6-developers-criticise-rockstars-reckless-decision-to-force-staff-back-to-the-office">return to the office five days a week</a> to close out Grand Theft Auto 6’s development – a move which makes the reason behind the delay pretty clear. Bloomberg reporter Jason Schreier confirmed as much on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jasonschreier.bsky.social/post/3lo6qieb3wc2x" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">BlueSky</a>, explaining that his own Rockstar sources said that there’s “Too much work, not enough time, and what appears to be a real desire from management to avoid brutal crunch.” Rockstar can’t properly deliver a game that will change the video gaming world if it slips back into old habits; while the delay is disappointing to those playing, it’s undeniably a huge relief to those developing.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>This generation needs a definitive console-shifting title – it needs Grand Theft Auto 6. </p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">If you’re a publisher, releasing your game at the same time as Grand Theft Auto 6 is akin to throwing a bucket of water into a tsunami. Discussing the formerly scheduled ‘Fall 2025’ release window, a report by <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/major-publishers-plan-to-delay-games" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Game Business</a> highlighted how such a nebulous date was affecting publishers worldwide. One studio boss called Rockstar’s game “a huge meteor and we’ll just have to stay clear of the blast zone,” while another questioned “if we move out of 2025, what if Rockstar do, too?” (An unsurprisingly predictive worry). We even have the likes of EA CEO Andrew Wilson <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ea-boss-willing-to-move-battlefield-release-date-to-account-for-nuanced-year-relative-to-competition-cough-gta-6-cough">implicitly commenting</a> on the game’s looming shadow in the context of the new Battlefield, citing “some things happening in the year that may cause us to think differently about our launch timing.” </p><p data-cy="paragraph">However, huge releases don’t always overshadow those around them. Despite launching at the same time as Bethesda’s Oblivion remake, Kepler Interactive’s original RPG Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 still <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hit-rpg-clair-obscur-expedition-33-tops-1-million-sales-in-just-3-days">sold over one million copies in just three days</a>, with senior portfolio manager Matt Handrahan even joking that it was the video game industry’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/clair-obscur-expedition-33-publisher-says-the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered-shadow-drop-actually-benefitted-the-game-by-drawing-attention-to-quality-rpgs-that-week">Barbenheimer moment</a>. It’s hard to believe such a moment can exist for Grand Theft Auto 6, of course, and so it goes unsaid that such a quirky idea will not be part of any publisher’s campaign plans. Don’t expect a Grand Theft Fable moment in 2026.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2023/12/05/screenshot-2023-12-05-134403-1701813164554.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Currently, it’s unclear to what extent the new May 26, 2026 release date will shake up the plans of other publishers and developers. There are still many heavy-hitter titles that are undated including the likes of Fable, Gears of War: E-Day, EA’s new Battlefield title, Mass Effect spiritual successor Exodus and more. There will certainly be some developers now scrambling to change their internal release date plans, but the wider public will be none the wiser. However, this flag planting by Rockstar no doubt means that developers and publishers will feel more confident in announcing their release plans to the world. But they might want to hold on a minute.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It seems very unlikely that this will be the final date for Grand Theft Auto 6 for two reasons. Both Grand Theft Auto 5 and Red Dead Redemption 2 were <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/we-shouldnt-be-surprised-gta-6-grand-theft-auto-delayed-rockstar-history">subject to two date delays</a>, with the first delay being to the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2017/05/22/red-dead-redemption-2-delayed-to-spring-2018">second quarter of the next year</a>, followed by a second delay to the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2018/02/01/red-dead-redemption-2-delayed-to-october">third quarter of that same year</a>. Right now, Grand Theft Auto 6 is replicating that exact same timeline, delayed from Fall 2025 to May 2026, so one more delay to October/November 2026 seems a reasonably educated prediction.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That October/November window seems even more likely when you consider the potential for both Microsoft and Sony to create a new console bundle including the crime sequel, which will surely shoot up sales around the holiday period. Sony sold 6.4 million PlayStation 4s during <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2015/02/ps4s-sales-dominance-slackens-slightly-in-holiday-quarter/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">October - December 2014</a>, more than double the consoles they sold between April and September of that year. Of course there would have been the classic Christmas boost, but what else happened in that time frame? Grand Theft Auto 5 released on PS4.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Rockstar only has one shot to get this right – what’s six more months after 13 years?</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">What could be the bigger surprise, though , is that Nintendo may be one of the parties most affected by this delay. Recently, Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-on-switch-2-publisher-pledges-support-says-era-when-nintendo-was-just-for-kids-is-over" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pledged full support for the Switch 2</a>, leading fans to speculate about if Grand Theft Auto 6 may also be eyeing a Switch 2 launch. Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy’s Definitive Edition saw a surprise launch onto the Nintendo Switch, so there’s precedent for an adult franchise on a typically family-friendly console. Many believed the Switch technology wasn’t powerful enough to run a game like Grand Theft Auto, however last year modders released a video showing off an <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/modders-use-leaked-source-code-to-get-gta-5-running-on-switch">in-progress port of GTA 5 running on Switch</a> using the game’s leaked source code. While it does seem unlikely that Nintendo would have factored Grand Theft Auto 6 into the Switch’s first-year success, there’s a clear, strong relationship between publisher Take-Two and Nintendo that shouldn’t be ignored. When looking at the console market as part of the overall video game industry, Nintendo is still a huge part of that no matter how much of an island they may seem. The Nintendo Switch was still host to an array of generation-defining games including The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim, Red Dead Redemption, Metal Gear Solid, Crysis and more. And with Cyberpunk 2077 arriving on Switch 2 at launch, complete with its current gen-only Phantom Liberty expansion, we shouldn’t ignore the potential for “miracle” ports. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">What’s clear is that there is a hell of a lot riding on Grand Theft Auto 6. Many different head honchos of the video game industry, from studio heads to chief analysts, believe that this generation-defining game will be the one to break the industry’s growth stagnation. It’s hard to deny the global feverish demand and anticipation for a game that has effectively been in the works for over a decade. There are impossibly high expectations on the teams at Rockstar Games to deliver something that not only single-handedly restores the video game industry back to its pre-pandemic growth, but also presents an entirely new kind of video game experience that will become the new benchmark for developers and publishers moving forward. Rockstar only has one shot to get this right – what’s six more months after 13 years?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Sab Astley is a freelance writer who has written for IGN, Polygon, TotalFilm, Rolling Stone, Radio Times, and Metro UK.</em></p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>
