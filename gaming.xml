              <p><em>Marathon</em> is a <a href="https://kotaku.com/marathon-runner-shells-trailer-abilities-bungie-2000660170">hero extraction shooter</a>, but it wasn’t always that way. Former franchise art director Joseph Cross detailed his time working on the game in a new interview, including a big change to a core aspect of the game midway through development. He also spoke about <a href="https://kotaku.com/marathon-art-director-joseph-cross-leaves-bungie-2000654665">leaving Bungie</a> after spending so much time working Destiny and the company’s upcoming multiplayer game.</p> <p>“The game design itself having a pretty profound evolution midway through, and that changed the visual psychology a fair amount,” the veteran artist <a href="https://www.readergrev.com/p/exit-interview-joseph-cross-marathon">told Mikhail Klimentov’s newsletter <em>ReaderGrev</em> in a new interview</a>. They Cross describes it, <em>Marathon</em>‘s runners were originally just generic throwaway mercenaries that players would customize to fit their own fantasy. It was only later on that the development team made the shift to actual characters with prescribed backstories, abilities, and unique visual identities.</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Marathon Art Style (a short thread). First of all thanks to everyone for all the kind words and enthusiasm for the art style/direction in our announce trailer, it's been amazing to see. This was the result of many talented artists working together, with the support of an amazing <a href="https://t.co/ePPi41KA6c">pic.twitter.com/ePPi41KA6c</a></p> <p>— Joseph Cross (@josephacross) <a href="https://twitter.com/josephacross/status/1663415929043296257?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 30, 2023</a></p></blockquote>  <p>“You’re going from designing one vehicle in a fleet of a thousand to now you’re designing the Millennium Falcon,” he said. “The psychology changes. I think that gets back to your original question, which is like, art relating to gameplay and at what point do those collide? And that certainly was a big one. In the case of this production it was a fairly significant event, and had to happen incredibly quickly, too.”</p> <p>The hero aspect has become an important part of the marketing around <em>Marathon</em>‘s in-world fiction and a differentiator between it and genre rivals like<em> Arc Raiders</em> and <em>Escape from Tarkov</em>. But it also gives the game one foot in the realm of a genre that some players seem incredibly burnt out on. Elsewhere in the interview, Cross said the game is banking a lot on its striking art style, which borrows inspiration from things as wide-ranging as Nike sneaker culture and Ikea furniture assembly, to help set it apart.</p>

 <p>He said:</p> <blockquote><p>There’s also something about the design of the game, where at a certain point I really did believe that art had potentially more of a responsibility for creating interest than it would if we were working on a different kind of game. The game design, nobody’s reinventing the wheel here. We’re putting compelling spins on established mechanics. The narrative is also not reinventing the wheel. It’s an abandoned space colony where something mysterious happened. We’ve seen this a lot. It’s about how you spin it, and at some point, for better or for worse, I told myself that this is an opportunity for art to sort of step up and provide a level of newness to this world.</p></blockquote> <h2>Leaving Bungie on the eve of <em>Marathon</em>‘s release</h2> <p>So why did Cross, who spent over a decade working on art for the studio, beginning with the original Destiny, decide to recently leave before <em>Marathon</em> ships? He said he’s an artist first and increasingly conscious of the limited number of new projects he’ll actually get to work on in his lifetime. “I’m not a founder of Bungie,” he told Klimentov. “This is not my company. And I’m conscious of the number of projects I get to work on in my life. I’m not getting any younger. I’ve spent what will ultimately be 15 years, essentially, on two projects for Bungie: <i>Destiny</i>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<i>Marathon</i>, with film work in between.”</p>

 <p>Cross’ decided on his departure just a couple weeks before <a href="https://kotaku.com/marathon-release-date-trailer-leak-bungie-2000660975"><em>Marathon</em>‘s new March 5 release date</a> was decided. “The natural cadence of the kind of work that happens post-launch in a live service game, I also understood what that was looking like,” he added. “It’s also true that at the level of seniority that I had, there are challenges there that don’t necessarily exist as an artist, and getting to this phase of a project like this at that level had its own challenges that contributed also.”</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Whether you’re a content creator who relies on great sound or just someone who needs to record audio or interviews, an excellent and affordable mic can be hard to find. DJI is here to save the content creation world again with another affordable product you won’t want to miss out on. You can snatch up the DJI Mic 3 for a discounted price right now.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6786/">The DJI Mic 3 (2 TX + 1 RX + Charging Case) is up for grabs at Amazon for sale, where you can pick it up for $259</a>. That’s a savings of $70 and 21% less than the normal $329 price tag.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6786/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>A mic that’s great for casual creators and established professionals</h2>
<p>The DJI Mic 3 Bundle (2 Transmitters + Receiver + Charging Case) combines two wireless transmitters, a small wireless receiver and a charging case into a single lightweight portable recording package. DJI describes the system as ultra-light with adaptive gain control for maintaining a consistent volume level regardless of the type of speaker,. It also uses dual-band anti-interference technology to help prevent interference from nearby wireless devices.</p>
<p>DJi states that the combined battery life will provide up to 28 hours of continuous use when taking into account the charging case, allowing you to shoot for extended periods of time before having to charge the case again.</p>
<p>Two clip-on transmitters and a wireless receiver that mount to a camera hot shoe, can be used to create a complete 2 person wireless microphone system. All of these components fit inside the provided charging case that allows all of the components to remain organized and charged during non-use intervals.</p>



<p>The receiver can connect to as many as four wireless microphones and synchronize audio to as many as eight receivers, with four-channel output available for larger production needs. Therefore, you can begin with the two wireless microphones provided, and then purchase additional units to expand your recording capabilities.</p>
<p>Each of the two wireless microphones is capable of internally recording two separate files of 32 bit floating point data, providing a wider dynamic range than typical 24-bit systems, and therefore more opportunities for adjusting levels in post-production.</p>
<p>Additional details regarding power and connectivity include a charging case that not only powers the transmitters and the receiver but also stores all of the provided accessories. In terms of total operation time, DJI rates the system at 28 hours or more, depending on how often you are using each component before needing to recharge the case.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6786/">If you’re ready to upgrade your mic situation or just want to add another to your arsenal, you can’t go wrong with this setup. Act quickly and get yours before it disappears from stock again.</a></p>

Projects can have extremely high up-front costs—often funded by investors or publishers—and generate the bulk of their revenue in the short window after release. That means there are long periods where studios burn overhead while little money comes in. The problem is exacerbated if a publisher has a high revenue share or loans need to be paid back.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Balancing that equation is a key task as the game industry looks to recover from years of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/industry-layoffs-are-seemingly-slowing-but-the-damage-has-already-been-done">mass layoffs</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/report-xbox-closes-the-initiative-and-cancels-its-perfect-dark-reboot">studio closures,</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> especially for triple-A studios. IO Interactive CEO Hakan Abrak says there's one strategy that's helped the </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Hitman World of Assassination</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> studio become stable: deliberately producing sequels with lower budgets than the original game.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Abrak laid out this strategy in a late-November conversation with Game Developer while discussing IO Interactive's ongoing live support for </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>World of Assassination</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. The studio drives interest (and revenue) through regular updates, including its celebrity-driven "Elusive Target" missions. But before it could enter that cycle, it had to produce the three Hitman games now united under the </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>World of Assassination</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> banner.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">To do so, Abrak said the company deliberately produced 2018's </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Hitman 2</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and 2021's </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Hitman 3</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> on lower budgets than than 2016 game </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Hitman</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, which cost about $70 million (Abrak previously disclosed these budget numbers on the </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://gamemakersnotebook.libsyn.com/exploring-the-world-of-hitman-with-io-interactives-hakan-abrak">Game Makers Notebook podcast</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">). "The investment in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Hitman </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">2016, the start of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>World of Assassination</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, was a sizable investment," he explained, noting the company maintains its own bespoke game engine called Glacier. "But </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Hitman 2</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, which had a higher Metacritic [score] took half of the time and cost almost half of the budget" (around $40 million).He said the sequel was also a bigger commercial success, driving higher returns for IO Interactive.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/independent-game-festival-freeplay-warns-its-days-could-be-numbered" target="_self" data-discover="true">Independent game festival Freeplay warns its days could be numbered</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This is in contrast to other triple-A projects at companies like Sony Interactive Entertainment, where sequels like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The Last of Us Part II</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Horizon Forbidden West</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> cost more than </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/-i-the-last-of-us-part-ii-i-and-i-horizon-forbidden-west-i-cost-200m-each-to-make">double their predecessors</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> to produce despite existing gameplay and technological foundations.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Hitman 3</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> was then produced in just under two years, earned the highest Metacritic score of the three games, and cost $20 million, close to a quarter of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Hitman</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">'s budget.

            <guid>1410679</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The WD Black 1TB C50 Xbox Storage Expansion Card provides 1 full terabyte of additional storage for the Xbox Series X or Xbox Series S, with the same speeds as the internal SSD. The C50 expansion card is a compact NVMe solid-state drive that fits into the dedicated expansion card slot at the rear of the console. It is compatible with Xbox Velocity Architecture, so the majority of your games will launch quickly and remain available via Quick Resume. The small black housing of the C50 is designed to match the console’s rear and provide a clean, clutter-free appearance when inserted into the expansion slot and secured by clicking into place.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6785/">You can find the WD Black 1TB C50 Xbox Storage Expansion Card currently for sale at Amazon.com for $150, down from the original price of $200, a savings of $50 and 25%.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6785/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>A reliable expansion card for your Xbox console</h2>
<p>Because it has been certified by Microsoft for use with their latest generation of consoles and utilizes the expansion port of the console, the C50 allows you to store and run your most recent generation games directly from the card at the same speeds they would be accessed from the internal SSD. Quick Resume also functions as expected, so you can continue to switch between paused and resumed games, even when the storage limits of the internal SSD have been reached. Unlike external USB-based storage devices that only let you archive your Xbox Series X/S titles, the WD Black C50 enables you to install your titles directly to the card and play them just like they were on the internal SSD.</p>
<p>Installing the WD Black C50 is easy and requires no complicated steps. Power down the console, then slide the card into the identified expansion port at the back of the console. Securely insert the card by pressing firmly into place until you hear it click securely into the port. Once the console is powered back on, it will automatically recognize the card and present the new storage capacity to the user for selection and installation of their desired titles.</p>



<p>The WD Black C50 is compact and industrial-looking, and is designed to fit seamlessly into the console’s design rather than appear as an external device attached via a USB port. Additionally, the size and lightweight nature of the WD Black C50 make it unobtrusive regardless of whether the console is positioned vertically or horizontally in a home entertainment system. Included with the WD Black C50 are the card itself, a protective cover for the card, and a short, easy-to-follow guide that outlines basic installation procedures.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6785/">At a discounted price of $150, versus the original MSRP of $200,</a> the WD Black C50 provides plug-in storage capacity that operates at console-level speeds, allowing users to retain additional titles on their Xbox Series X/S consoles without degrading performance.</p>

And it’s Baldur’s Gate 3 that has shown remarkable staying power, particularly on Steam where it is still seeing peak concurrent player numbers above 100,000 despite being two-and-a-half years old.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">2017's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/divinity-original-sin-ii">Divinity: Original Sin 2</a>, meanwhile, has also seen an uptick in players following the Divinity announcement, with peak concurrents in the tens of thousands rather than thousands in the weeks since. (<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/what-is-divinity-larian-studios-baldurs-gate-3">If you're wondering what Divinity is, check out IGN's handy explainer</a>.)</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">According to Larian boss Swen Vincke, it’s not just that people who already own Baldur’s Gate 3 or Divinity: Original Sin 2 are returning to the game. People are buying both games in significant numbers and jumping in for the first time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Sales for both BG3 and D:OS2 have been incredible since the announcement of Divinity,” <a href="https://x.com/LarAtLarian/status/2013481225030094906" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Vincke said</a>. “D:OS2 really surprised us by having its best month since release in 2017. Wish I’d removed the squirrel in time :)”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Typically, multiplayer live service games are expected to retain a large playerbase over the course of years, with revenue generated by the sale of in-game items such as battle passes, cosmetics, and DLC add-ons. Indeed, Steam’s top 10 most-played games are packed with live service games such as Counter-Strike 2, Dota 2, and PUBG.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">But there are some single-player games that buck this trend. Bethesda’s single-player RPGs such as Skyrim and Fallout are usually there or thereabouts in terms of Steam popularity. CD Projekt’s The Witcher 3 and Cyberpunk 2077 remain hugely popular even now, years after launch. And Baldur’s Gate 3 is perhaps top of the single-player tree, with renewed interest in all things Larian following the Divinity reveal fueling it further.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking of Divinity, Larian recently held a reddit AMA to answer questions from fans. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/everything-we-learned-about-divinity-from-larians-reddit-ama">Here’s everything we learned about Divinity from it</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.

            <p>Larian Studios' <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/divinity-will-be-a-turn-based-rpg-and-see-larian-unleashed-declares-ceo-swen-vincke-replacing-the-dd-system-with-one-made-for-a-video-game">new Divinity game</a> has been the talk of town since it was revealed at <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-everything-announced-at-the-game-awards-2025">The Game Awards 2025</a>. Even the comments on potential gen-AI use, ensuing backlash, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/change-of-mind-larian-says-it-will-not-use-gen-ai-at-all-in-relation-to-divinity-concept-art">course-correction</a> haven't sunk the excitement around the next RPG from the developers behind <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-a-critical-success-with-critical-failures">Baldur's Gate 3</a>. In fact, the 2023 CRPG and the studio's previous game, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/divinity-original-sin-2-review">Divinity: Original Sin 2</a>, have seen a surge in popularity.</p>
<p>Though <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1086940/charts/#max">BG3's hold for the past couple of years</a> has been quite solid, users took to social media on 20th January to point out it was faring well even in the face of new releases and online giants like <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/arc-raiders-robot-bosses-set-to-become-even-scarier-pve-escalate-embark">Arc Raiders</a>. Larian boss Swen Vincke, who's also leading development on the new Divinity, quickly added a quick comment on their previous two games' very enduring appeal:</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>Sales for both BG3 and D:OS 2 have been incredible since the announcement of  Divinity. </p><p>D:OS 2 really surprised us by having its best month since release in 2017.  Wish I’d removed the squirrel in time :) <a href="https://t.co/fXTEUtuS7r">https://t.co/fXTEUtuS7r</a></p></div>— Swen Vincke @where? (@LarAtLarian) <a href="https://twitter.com/LarAtLarian/status/2013481225030094906?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 20, 2026</a></blockquote></div>
<p><span data-type="targeting">
<span>To see this content please enable targeting cookies.</span>
</span>
</p></div>
<p>It must be noted Vincke talked about sales for both games, which aren't fully represented by the actual concurrent players activity we're seeing. Moreover, we only have access to data on Steam's numbers, but with Larian's catalogue seeing recent sales across all the available platforms and <a href="https://www.ign.com/videos/divinity-original-sin-2-official-nintendo-switch-2-xbox-series-xs-ps5-launch-trailer">Original Sin 2 getting a native Switch 2 port and current-gen upgrades</a>, it's not hard to believe many folks are finally jumping on the massive RPGs now.</p>
<p>The developer also stated the previous Divinity game has had its best month since its launch in 2017, which might be true if you look at the full picture (again, we'll have to believe Larian here), but doesn't fit <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/435150/charts/#max">SteamDB's all-time chart</a>, which you can also find below.</p>
<figure>
 


<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>SteamDB</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The game's highest post-launch peak is found on March 2020, right as the Covid pandemic started, when it got to 30,882 concurrent players. This month, it reached its best numbers (27,409) since then though.</p>
<p><a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1086940/charts/#max">As for Baldur's Gate 3</a>, its best post-launch moments happened in January 2024 (297,492) and April 2025 (169, 267). Right now, it's sitting at (127,254) on Steam. Again, the total could be much higher across all platforms.</p>
<figure>
 


<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>SteamDB</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>As a side note, Larian has also stated <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/larian-will-certainly-consider-a-divinity-switch-2-release">the studio will consider a Nintendo Switch 2 port of Divinity</a> as well as look into supporting Steam Deck again after BG3's success on Valve's handheld PC.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/razer-kishi-ultra-gaming-controller-is-almost-50-off-mobile-gaming-can-feel-way-better-for-much-less-2000661027</link>
            <guid>1410649</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Little cousins love to ask the question, “What games you got on your phone?” Not too long ago, the answer to that question would be a humble response. <em>Flappybird</em>, some <em>Tetris</em> ripoff, maybe <em>Words With Friends</em>. Or even that one app that makes it look like you’re drinking a beer, though that technically isn’t even a game.</p>
<p>But now? The answer to that same question in 2026? EVERYTHING. The App Store is full of real games now. <em>Fortnite</em>, <em>Minecraft</em>, and<em> Roblox</em>—of course—all can be downloaded and played right from your phone. And with cloud gaming available with services like Xbox Game Pass Ultimate and PS Remote Play, that list of games you can play grows exponentially. Though, many of these games are far better when experienced with a controller than with a touchscreen. So come bring your phone’s interface up onto the level of the games it can now play.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6784/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>
<p>The Razer Kishi ultra gaming controller is exactly what your need, bringing you the ergonomics of an actual gamepad for when your gaming on your phone. Right now, Amazon happens to have the controller add-on for a massive discount. Normally set at $150, the price has been cut to nearly half. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6784/">A limited time Amazon deal has the controller discounted by a staggering 47%, meaning you end up only having to pay $80 to completely elevate your mobile gaming.</a></p>

<h2>Pro Grade Console Controls on Mobile</h2>
<p>All you do is just slot your phone or tablet in between the two sides of the controller and presto. You have yourself a gaming handheld, evoking the design of the Nintendo Switch or a Steam Deck.</p>
<p>The controller connects to your mobile device over USB-C. So if you’re still holding onto that old iPhone 15 or even earlier model, you best upgrade before purchasing this because it is not compatible with the discontinued Lightning port. Android users need not worry. And since it’s plug in, no need to worry about any latency.</p>



<p>The construction of the Razer Kishi is solid. The controller is equipped with a Mecha-tactile eight-way d-pad and action buttons, Hall Effect triggers, programmable buttons, and ultra durable TPSiV analog sticks. It even supports haptic vibrations.</p>
<p>The controller isn’t limited to mobile gaming. You can even plug it in over USB-C to a PC to use it like any other PC gaming controller. It’s a little funky looking without a phone or tablet stuck in the middle, and you might prefer a different controller for PC gaming. However, if you’re traveling and trying to pack light, you can use just the one controller for both mobile gaming and gaming on your laptop which is pretty rad.</p>

<p>Forza Horizon 6 is racing onto the scene this year, but following the release of its predecessor on PlayStation 5, questions regarding platforms are already starting to appear.</p>



<p>If you’re a PlayStation 5 gamer and you’re looking for details on whether Forza Horizon 6 will be available on PS5, Insider Gaming has all the details.</p>







<h2 id="h-will-forza-horizon-6-be-on-playstation-5">Will Forza Horizon 6 be on PlayStation 5?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Coming soon. Image via Playground Games</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Yes, Forza Horizon 6 will be playable on PlayStation 5, Playground Games have confirmed, though it won’t be launched immediately on the console.</strong></p>



<p>After the success of releasing Forza Horizon 5 on PS5, the decision to release the sequel on the PlayStation platform has been confirmed in advance of launch, and the wait will be shorter than the many years it took for Forza Horizon 5 to make the move onto the platform.</p>



<p>Forza Horizon 6 will, however, initially launch exclusively on Microsoft platforms on Xbox Series X|S and PC, before making a move to PlayStation at a later date.</p>



<p>Just like its predecessor, this will include all content and crossplay, allowing players across all platforms to play together when exploring, racing, or causing chaos.</p>



<h2 id="h-when-will-forza-horizon-6-be-on-playstation-5">When Will Forza Horizon 6 be on PlayStation 5?</h2>



<p><strong>No precise launch window has been announced for Forza Horizon 6 on PlayStation 5, with confirmation stating only that the arrival will be “post-launch”.</strong></p>



<p>In the <a href="https://forza.net/news/forza-horizon-6-reveal" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Forza Horizon 6 reveal</a>, it was stated that, due to “the excitement for this franchise on other platforms,” Playground Games and Turn 10 Studios are “working together to bring Forza Horizon 6 to PlayStation 5 post-launch.”</p>



<p>While the history of Forza Horizon doesn’t provide too much of an insight, given Xbox’s approach to cross-platform launches is relatively new, other titles may provide a hint of how long PlayStation gamers will have to wait.</p>



<p>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle was released in December 2024 on Xbox Series X|S and PC, with a PlayStation 5 version launching four months later in April 2025. Using that timeframe, expect there to be at least a few months before a PS5 launch of Forza Horizon 6.</p>

<p>Forza Horizon 6 is one of the biggest games releasing from Microsoft-owned developers this year, and the series will be heading to a new location.</p>



<p>After an extended stint in Mexico with the last edition of the game, Insider Gaming has all the details on where Forza Horizon 6 will take place.</p>







<h2 id="h-where-will-forza-horizon-6-take-place">Where Will Forza Horizon 6 Take Place?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>A new setting. Image via Playground Games</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Forza Horizon 6 will bring the franchise to Japan, a setting that has been heavily requested by players since the first game in the series.</strong></p>



<p>The setting of Forza Horizon 6 was <a href="https://forza.net/news/forza-horizon-6-reveal" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced by Playground Games</a> at the Tokyo Game Show in September 2025, where it was stated that players “will get to discover a scenic and breathtaking Japan,” while the reveal trailer showed several locations, including Tokyo, Mt. Fuji, and roads lined with cherry blossom trees.</p>



<p>In the reveal FAQ, PlayGround Games added that “Japan has been one of the most iconic and requested locations by the community,” and that bringing the Horizon Festival to the region “has been one of our largest ambitions yet.” </p>



<p>Advancements in technology and design will provide players with a world that they “hope you will fall in love with,” and they can’t wait for players to “discover the beautiful landscapes and rich heritage of Japan” when Forza Horizon 6 releases.</p>



<p>Japan follows on from Colorado, France, Italy, Australia, the UK, and Mexico as the locations in the Forza Horizon series.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-much-of-japan-will-forza-horizon-6-feature">How Much of Japan Will Forza Horizon 6 Feature?</h2>



<p><strong>The full map size for Forza Horizon 6 in Japan has not been showcased, though it has been announced the setting will be a “region” of Japan, and not a single city or location.</strong></p>



<p>Forza Horizon games usually take an area of a location and reduce its size to be smaller, allowing for a variety of biomes to be featured, which results in the likes of Forza Horizon 5 having barren desert landscapes and lush jungles. On top of this, the seasonal changes significantly tweak the look of the environment.</p>



<p>Tokyo is sure to feature, along with Mt. Fuji, and more details of the map, and how the size compares to previous games in the franchise, will be revealed closer to launch.</p>

<p>A new concept leak offers players a glimpse of the Fable reboot’s locations, items, story elements, and more ahead of its official reveal at the Xbox Developer Direct. </p>



<p>For those unaware, Playground Games had <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fable-delayed-into-2026-by-xbox/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">delayed</a> the release of the Fable reboot to 2026 last year to give the title more time. We were finally going to receive an extended look at the title at the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/first-games-confirmed-for-xbox-developer-direct/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Xbox Developer Direct</a> this week. However, a leak has now revealed some major details ahead of the event. </p>







<h2 id="h-fable-leak-suggests-return-to-bloodstone-a-fable-2-location">Fable Leak Suggests Return to Bloodstone, a Fable 2 Location</h2>



<p>A report by <a href="https://mp1st.com/news/fable-rebootconcept-art-showcase-locations" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">MP1ST</a> reveals concept art for the Fable reboot, shared in an artist’s portfolio who previously contributed to the game. One of the most important finds in these images is the return of Bloodstone, a port town from Fable 2, known for housing criminals. The castle’s entry was situated between a range of mountains, which is how you might access Bloodstone in the Fable reboot. </p>



<p>Different areas surrounding this location were highlighted, including the Market District, Pub Island, and Arena. Some routes lead to characters like Artisan and Jacobs. The location features signs indicating it operates as a functioning town, such as one showing a man selling his fresh catch of fish and another reading “The Phoenix Feather.”</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>The Fable concept art leak revealed another location: a swamp village named Hamlet in the files. Two versions of this location were showcased in the artwork; one depicting its original appearance and the other illustrating the effects of a flood on the village, which could serve as a story element.</p>



<p>Moreover, there are images of the main character travelling through sewers and facing off against a werewolf. The werewolf’s den is filled with hanging corpses along with skulls and bones spread across the area. Lastly, there’s also an image of different versions of chests that players can acquire in the game.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Readers should note that there is no information regarding when this concept art was created, so details may change by the time the final version of the game is released. We might receive confirmation about some of these details during the Xbox Developer Direct next week.</p>







<p>In other news, an <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/alleged-screenshot-reveals-forza-horizon-6-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">alleged screenshot</a> has revealed the release date for Forza Horizon 6.

            <p>A bunch of alleged concept art for the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/fable-everything-we-know">Fable</a> reboot has reportedly been unearthed via a developer's portfolio, ahead of the RPG's appearance at this week's Xbox showcase. As of writing, there's no indication as to what stage of developement the apparent game art could be from. However, if it's genuine, it does seem to point towards a location from Fable 2 making a return in the reboot.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The alleged art's been shared by <a href="https://mp1st.com/news/fable-rebootconcept-art-showcase-locations">MP1ST</a>, who claim to have pulled it from the portfolio of an unnamed developer who worked on the game at some juncture between right now and the beginning of time.</p>
<p>Taking a look through the gallery of 29 images, a few of which aren't in colour, a good number appear to reference or depict Bloodstone. Fable 2 frolickers will remember a coastal town of that name being a pirate haven you visit on your quest to recruit Reaver, a tophatted rogue whose help you need to do big spoilery things. Well, if one of these images appearing to show the layout of its market district is to be believed, Bloodstone may now be home to a "pub island".</p>
<p>One of the images which appears to show Fable's protagonist looking out over a rocky vista also includes a sign with Bloodstone's name scrawled on it. Though, said sign appears to indicate you can get to Bloodstone both by heading in a certain direction or its complete opposite direction, which has raised my eyebrow slightly. Beyond these, MP1ST claim some of the images show a swampy village filenames suggest to be called The Hamlet, with multiple interprations of its nature-encusted homesteads appearing to show them before and after being abandoned.</p><p>There's also a sequence of sewer exploration, some more of the sort of whimsical fantasy architecture you might expect from Fable, and no less than two shots prominently featuring sheep. All in all, I'd say none of it looks hugely out of line with the pre-alpha gameplay Playground showed off when they <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/fable-has-been-delayed-until-2026-because-the-studio-needs-more-time-says-xbox">announced the game's delay to 2026</a> last year - not that this counts for anything in terms of proving the art's real.</p>
<p>For now, all we can do is wait for that Developer Direct Fable's set to rock up at on Thursday, January 22nd. There, Xbox have promised, will be Fable things you don't have to gulp down with a tablespoon of salt. Well, unless you really can't stand <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PEQRwpMYPaw">Richard Ayoade</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Valentine’s Day is less than a month away, and it’s the perfect excuse to tell your partner how much they mean to you. A thoughtful gift can, of course, sweeten that expression, and if you’re after something beyond flowers or chocolates – something that lets you both spend quality time together – the LEGO Art Love collectible building set deserves your attention.</p>
<p>You can create your own small version of Robert Indiana’s famous LOVE sculpture with this one, that too without paying the full price right now. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6783/">It’s currently available at Amazon for just $64, down from $80, after the retailer slashed the price by 20%.</a> But as you’d expect, the offer is selling out fast. Hurry to pick one up, before it’s too late!</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6783/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Fun Weekend Activity</h2>
<p>This set comes with 791 pieces in total, and is based on the famous real-life sculpture with a similar design and colors (red, blue, and green). Less than 800 pieces means it won’t really be one of those massive building projects that take weeks to complete. It can be a fun weekend activity with your loved one, where you guys bond over the experience. You can take turns following the steps, or each focus on one letter, as the set comes with two building instructions. Prepare some hot chocolate, pull out a list of thoughtful questions, and get started with the thing. Before you know it, you won’t even realize how long it’s been since you last picked up your phone.</p>



<p>You can even gift it to a friend to appreciate their presence in your life, or a parent who enjoys creative activities. Once built, the model measures over 10 inches (25 cm) high, 10 inches (25 cm) wide, and 2.5 inches (6 cm) deep. It can be a great display piece anywhere you like; place it on a shelf in the living room, the dining area, or even your office to add some personality to it. The model is sure to turn some heads!</p>
<p>Getting started is straightforward. The included instruction books take you through each step of the process one-by-one. The booklets are quite easy to follow, but you can also download the LEGO Builder app for 3D instructions. The app offers zoom and rotate features that make it easy to view each block from every side.</p>
<p>The LEGO Art range features more such brick-built artworks that let you create iconic pieces and pop-culture figures. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6783/">We’re spotting quite a few sets at a discounted rate, which makes now a great time to grab the ones you’ve been eyeing for a long time.</a> As for the current discount, we’re expecting it to wrap soon. It’s best to act quickly to score the drop.</p>

            <p>
Following last week's announcement that long-running MMO The Elder Scrolls Online would be moving away from traditional major expansions to focus on smaller seasonal updates, developer ZeniMax Online has insisted the big shake-up is in no way related to last year's sweeping layoffs at parent company Microsoft, which <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/zenimax-employees-discuss-chaos-of-microsofts-inhumane-mass-layoffs-in-new-report">heavily impacted</a> the studio.
</p>
<p>
Last July, in a year that saw Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella boast "record performance" and a revenue increase to $281.7bn, the company <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-begins-substantial-layoff-process-across-gaming-division-king-and-zenimax-impacted">announced mass layoffs</a> affecting over 9000 employees across the company, marking its third round of significant job cuts since 2023. The move - which impacted numerous Xbox studios including Rare, Turn 10, The Initiative, and Raven Software - was accompanied by multiple project cancellations.

<p>
ZeniMax Online Studios' in-development sci-fi MMO Project Blackbird was one of the games impacted, and its cancellation coincided with nearly 200 job cuts at the studio. But following last week's announcement that <a href="https://www.elderscrollsonline.com/en-us/news/post/69137">The Elder Scrolls Online would be shifting to smaller seasonal releases</a>, executive producer Susan Kath has insisted the two events are unrelated.
</p>
<p>
"Seasons is not in any way a response to [the layoffs]," Kath <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-elder-scrolls-online-smaller-expansions-are-not-in-any-way-a-result-of-last-years-layoffs">recently told RockPaperShotgun</a>. "We kicked off the Season work at least 12 to 14 months ago. We started making the changes in the team to move in this direction, knowing that this was our intent."
</p><p>
Kath describes 2025 as a "hard year for the studio", but acknowledges Blackbird's cancellation could be seen as a positive for ESO. "Ultimately, we had a lot of people doing double duty on those projects, splitting their time between projects," she continued. "[They] are now devoted 100 percent to Elder Scrolls Online. So, in fact, in some capacities, we actually increased the number of folks available as we came out of that because they weren't managing two products anymore. They were only devoted to one title."
</p>
<p>
ZeniMax first publicly discussed the idea of smaller updates for The Elder Scrolls Online shortly after the layoffs. In September, studio game director Rich Lambert <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/the-elder-scrolls-online-heads-on-the-aftermath-of-microsofts-cuts-and-the-future-of-the-long-running-mmo">told GamesIndustry.biz</a> the MMO was in "a bit of a transition year", and that the team was now looking to get "smaller, more bite-sized things out quicker". The aim, he said, was to launch these smaller updates roughly every six to nine months, compared to the 12-15 month release schedule for traditional expansions. And last week, ZeniMax formalised its plans, announcing a move to smaller, quarterly - and free - seasons, starting 2nd April, which will also see many earlier paid expansions rolled into the base game. This change coincides with the introduction of a seasonal (but not time-limited) battle pass, featuring a free tier and two paid extensions.

<p>
In a press briefing attended by <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/">RPS</a> ahead of the announcement, Elder Scrolls Online game director Nick Giaomini insisted the shift would give the team the "flexibility to make our game more exciting and invest in addressing long standing pain points, add features and improvements players have been asking for, and update and iterate on the core game, rather than always just chasing something brand new."
</p><p>
"To say that [the layoffs] didn't impact us wouldn't be right," Giacomini added. "We're putting on a strong face. We're human. It absolutely impacted us. But, you know, the team rallied. We're excited about the future. We're excited that we're making all these big changes."

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/pokemon-legends-z-a">Pokémon</a> is celebrating its 30th anniversary on 27th February, and we're collectively dying to see what might be revealed about the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-teraleak-reveals-unannounced-games-seemingly-laying-out-franchises-major-releases-through-2030">long-rumoured next mainline game</a> and other projects. Moreover, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/pokemon-pokopia">Pokopia</a> aims to shake things up with a new take on town life sims in early March. In its beginnings, however, the series took a long time to figure out.</p>
<p>This is what The Pokémon Company president and CEO Tsunekazu Ishihara said during a brief appearance at the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9HNNugGXKQ0">New York Game Awards</a> through a special video (hat tip to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/01/pokemons-game-boy-development-process-took-a-great-deal-of-trial-and-error">Nintendo Life</a>). The franchise as a whole <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/pokemon-to-receive-prestigious-award-at-the-15th-annual-new-york-game-awards">received the Andrew Yoon Legend Award</a>, which celebrates a "sustained body of work demonstrating exceptional artistic achievement and innovation."</p>
<p>Ishihara took this opportunity to reflect on the series' humble origins. The games were made with "limited resources" back then, and he underlined Red and Green took "a great deal of trial and error" to get right and to the finish line. He even revealed the entire process ended up lasting six years, which is shocking to learn about when you consider dev cycles back in the day were substantially shorter than nowadays. What now feels normal rarely happened back then.</p>
<p>We know it all paid off in the end, and much like us, Ishihara believes it was all about having a strong base-level idea the team was confident about: "Still, we all felt confident in the main gameplay elements that would become the foundation of the Pokémon video game series: catch, raise, trade, and battle." These elements were designed with nostalgic themes and warm feelings in mind, as it was all tied to "fundamental experiences" many players had as children who connected with nature.</p><p>That said, he was "uncertain at first" about its appeal outside Japan as many formative childhood experiences aren't shared. Needless to say, there was nothing to be scared of. After that initial hit, Pokémon's core themes of friendship and our (often very complicated) relationship with the world shaped the franchise's identity.</p>
<p>No comments on the next main game from Ishihara beyond continuing to use those tenets as a "major driving force," but that could change soon.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[‘It’s Absolutely Crazy’ – Veteran Developer Can’t Wrap His Head Around Clair Obscur: Expedition 33’s Quality and Its Small Team]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/veteran-dev-cant-wrap-his-head-on-clair-obscur-expedition-33-quality/</link>
            <guid>1410607</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Much has been said about the incredible level of quality that <strong>Sandfall Interactive</strong> put into <strong>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</strong>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/sandfall-interactive-made-clair-obscur-expedition-33-for-under-10-million-to-prove-it-could/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">with a budget of <strong>less than $10 million</strong></a> and a core team of <strong>around thirty employees</strong>. </p>



<p>Now, <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/witchfires-creative-director-on-the-benefits-of-small-teams-and-the-mystery-of-how-clair-obscur-turned-out-so-brilliantly" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in an interview with GamesIndustry.biz</a>, another veteran developer has expressed his absolute disbelief at what the Montpellier-based studio was able to pull off with this game. He's <strong>Adrian Chmielarz</strong>, the founder and CEO of independent Polish developer <strong>The Astronauts</strong>, known for <strong>The Vanishing of Ethan Carter</strong> and the upcoming roguelite first-person shooter <strong>Witchfire</strong> (on which I <a href="https://wccftech.com/witchfire-qa-on-long-dev-phase-egs-exclusivity-dlss-3s-phenomenal-frame-rate-boost-and-fsr-xess-support/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">interviewed him in September 2023</a>), due to be released out of early access at some point this year.</p>



<p>Chmielarz, who previously worked on games like <strong>Painkiller</strong>, <strong>Gears of War: Judgment</strong>, and <strong>Bulletstorm</strong> while at <strong>People Can Fly</strong> (which he originally founded in 2002), has always been outspoken. Just last month, he <a href="https://wccftech.com/egs-is-a-shop-steam-is-a-home-developer-explains-why-pc-users-attached-valves-platform/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shared his viewpoint on why PC gamers prefer <strong>Steam</strong> over the <strong>Epic Games Store</strong></a>.</p>



<p>In the new interview, he calls Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 '<strong>the biggest mystery in gaming right now</strong>':</p>



<p><em>Last week, I learned that the guys behind Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 hired a lot of newbies, people who didn't make a game before. And now my world view is ruined, and I don't know what to do. Here we have a game that looks AAA to me, it's just phenomenal in every aspect. There's a deep story, deep method of work, good gameplay, great visuals and sound. It's a very coherent product. And then you hear that the core team was 30 people, half of which were first timers. And I'm like, "I don't know what to believe anymore."</em></p>



<p><em>The head of the studio had a two-hour conference in France where they were discussing the process of making this game. I haven't watched this yet, but I downloaded it, and I have transcribed the audio and translated it to English. And this video is waiting for me, because I need to know the secret, because it's absolutely crazy.</em></p>



<p><em>Obviously, we didn't make Witchfire with 26 people, because we use outsourcing, and Sandfall Interactive used a lot of outsourcing – when you roll the credits on Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, it's 10 or 15 minutes long. But still, that doesn't change the fact that the core team responsible for the vast majority of the game and the ideas and execution is around 30 people, half of whom are new. So it's the biggest mystery in gaming right now.</em></p>



<p>That said, he does point out a couple of things with the eye of a designer. For one thing, <strong>the game's enemies lack faces by design</strong>, which is one way to cut down on animation work. Furthermore, the high-quality scenes are more like theatrical plays in that <strong>the characters never interact with the environment</strong>, which, in his experience, is one of the most challenging aspects when making cutscenes.</p>



<p>Quite obviously, there are other such 'tricks' that Sandfall has employed, but the final outcome cannot be argued with. Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 is winning <a href="https://wccftech.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-has-third-most-goty-wins-in-single-year/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">an astounding amount of prizes during the award season</a>, including a few days ago <a href="https://wccftech.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-wins-goty-2026-new-york-game-awards/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">at the <strong>New York Game Awards</strong></a>, and there's likely more awards to come.</p>

<p>ARC Raiders has some surprisingly deep lore behind the raid-and-repeat nature of the extraction shooter, and it all revolves around the ARC. These advanced robots have overtaken the Earth’s surface, but it all started with the First Wave. </p>



<p>That was all long ago in the history of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/what-is-aggression-based-matchmaking-in-arc-raiders/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ARC Raiders</a>, but the remains are still seen scattered across the various in-game maps. As is the nature of the game, these First Wave Husks can be looted for ARC materials, but knowing where to look is key.</p>







<p>Follow along with this guide to learn what to look for when searching for First Wave Husks, as well as the best places you can find them in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-patch-removes-out-of-map-exploit/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ARC Raiders</a>. </p>



<h2 id="h-what-are-first-wave-husks-in-arc-raiders">What Are First Wave Husks In ARC Raiders?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Image by Embark Studios</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>First Wave Husks are the older remains of ARC, as opposed to the freshly destroyed parts of ARC killed by raiders. </strong></p>



<p>Visually speaking, they stand out due to their more rusted and decrepit appearance. They’re often found half-buried in the ground, indicating that they’ve been there a long time. </p>



<p>There are three types of First Wave Husks you can find in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-copy-tarkov-flea-market/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ARC Raiders</a>. These are: </p>



<ul>
<li>Wasp Husks</li>



<li>Rocketeer Husks</li>



<li>Baron Husks</li>
</ul>



<p>The first two should seem familiar, since they’re both ARC you’ll commonly fight during a raid. The Baron Husks are a bit different, though. These large, spindly Husks have yet to be seen in fighting form, but you’ll find a good few of them on various maps. </p>



<p>Each of these First Wave Husks can be breached to find some ARC materials inside. That’s easy enough for the Wasp and Rocketeer Husks, but to breach a Baron, you’ll need to climb to the top of its head and breach. Once that’s done, flames will emit, so make sure you jump off and wait for the fire to subside before claiming your loot. </p>



<h2 id="h-best-places-to-find-first-wave-husks-in-arc-raiders">Best Places To Find First Wave Husks In ARC Raiders</h2>



<figure><figcaption>It’s an easy place to get to. Image by Embark Studios.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>First Wave Husks can be found on four of the five maps in ARC Raiders, with Stella Montis being the only exception. </strong></p>



<p>These <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/embark-studios-teases-multiple-maps-coming-arc-raiders/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">maps</a> include: </p>



<ul>
<li>Dam Battlegrounds</li>



<li>The Blue Gate</li>



<li>Spaceport</li>



<li>Buried City</li>
</ul>



<p>Typically, there’s a chance they can spawn littered across all of these maps, but there are a few more concentrated spots if you’re looking to find a solid batch at once. Generally speaking, though, you will want to search areas where it’s clear a battle has happened before. These wind up being ARC graveyards, of sorts, and contain a variety of First Wave Husks to search. </p>







<p>If you’re looking for some guaranteed locations, here are a few POIs to check out in ARC Raiders:</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th data-align="center">POI Name</th><th data-align="center">Map Name</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-align="center">Old Battleground</td><td data-align="center">Dam Battlegrounds</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Water Tower</td><td data-align="center">Spaceport</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Vehicle Maintenance</td><td data-align="center">Spaceport</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Barren Clearing</td><td data-align="center">The Blue Gate</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Adorned Wreckage</td><td data-align="center">The Blue Gate</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Broken Earth/Ridgeline</td><td data-align="center">The Blue Gate</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>Additionally, two map modifiers can help increase the spawn rates of First Wave Husks. These are <strong>Husk Graveyard</strong> and <strong>Electromagnetic Storm</strong>. Husk Graveyard is an event across all four maps, and it vastly increases the spawn rates of Husks, but it doesn’t offer the x2 points modifier for Trials since it’s only a minor map condition. </p>



<p>Electromagnetic Storm, on the other hand, does offer the x2 points modifier, whilst also increasing the spawn rates of Husks. However, it’s not available on Buried City, so keep an eye out for it on the other three maps. </p>

<p>Coming to Switch consoles this year</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Wishfully Studios' sublime debut, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/planet_of_lana">Planet of Lana</a>, brought some top-notch puzzle/platforming action to Switch back in April 2024. Indeed, we went so far as to give this beautiful-looking cinematic adventure a rather splendid <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/planet-of-lana">8/10 back at launch</a>.</p>
<p>Now, its Swedish dev, alongside publisher Thunderful Games (<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/atari-to-acquire-steamworld-dev-thunderful">now majority owned by Atari</a>), has dropped a full 10 minutes of unedited gameplay footage from the game's soon-to-be-released sequel, the cunningly titled <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/planet-of-lana-ii-children-of-the-leaf">Planet of Lana 2: Children of the Leaf</a>. Oh yes.</p>
<p>You can check out the video above, and we've got to say, rather unsurprisingly, it's looking like something we'll want to be playing as soon as it drops, on both Switch consoles, <em>sometime</em> in <strong>2026</strong>. Keeping its predecessor's stylish sci-fi tone, the trailer shows off a game that will surely look fantastic in handheld mode on either Switch.</p>

<p>The original Planet of Lana made amazingly good use of its sci-fi setting and its gorgeous art-stylings to hammer home an emotional, absorbing and otherworldly tale, which also has its fair share of very good puzzles and platforming to keep you busy.</p>
<p>You know the score if you've played cinematic games of this ilk before, your <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps2/ico">Icos</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/inside">Insides</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/another_world">Another Worlds</a>. Lots of running in fabulously animated fashion, basically, whilst avoiding death and making peace with the fact you have little in the way of defence. Relaxing!</p>

<p>ARC Raiders update 1.12.0 removes the out-of-map exploit from Stella Montis, along with duplication and other issues. </p>



<p>For those unaware, the out-of-bounds map glitch in Stella Montis was getting out of hand. So much so that last week, we learned that a trio of players was using this glitch to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-ceiling-glitch-players/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">exact revenge</a> on another trio that was using the same glitch. It seems that Embark Studios has had enough of it now and has finally patched the exploit. </p>







<h2 id="h-what-s-new-in-arc-raiders-patch-1-12-0">What’s New in ARC Raiders Patch 1.12.0?</h2>



<p>It seems that the ARC Raiders patch released today, update 1.12.0, is focused on removing the exploits players have been using to gain an unfair advantage in the game. First and foremost, the duplication glitch has been fixed, stopping players from duplicating items and ammo. </p>



<p>Next, players were previously taking damage through the map’s geometry, but this issue has now been resolved. Lastly, the ARC Raiders bug that hindered players has been fixed, along with several out-of-bounds map exploits on Stella Montis. This should hopefully put an end to players taking advantage of them.</p>



<h2 id="h-all-patch-notes-for-arc-raiders-update-1-12-0">All Patch Notes for ARC Raiders Update 1.12.0</h2>



<ul>
<li>Fixed an item duplication exploit.</li>



<li>Fixed an ammo duplication exploit.</li>



<li>Fixed some cases where players were able to damage others from behind geometry.</li>



<li>Fixed various out-of-bounds map locations on Stella Montis.</li>
</ul>
