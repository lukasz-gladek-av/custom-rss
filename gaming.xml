            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section><p>Sitting down to play <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/lumo_2">Lumo 2</a>, as a gamer of a certain vintage, I fully expected to be treated to a few touching moments as developer Triple Eh? transported me back to the sweet innocence (and unbelievable stupidity) of my gaming childhood. A few nostalgia button pushes and I'd be happy enough. Sit that alongside some decent gameplay, and we could be onto a winner.</p>
<p>Just as was the case in 2016's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/lumo">Lumo</a>, the point here is to give you short bursts of action-styles from classic adventures resurrected from the depths of computer game history. You know the sorts of things; in the first Lumo you had stuff like <strong>Knight Lore</strong>, <strong>Equinox</strong> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/head_over_heels">Head Over Heels</a>, whilst this sequel serves up...well...to list them all would be spoiling things, but let's just saying kicking off your game with a delightfully spot-on homage to Dennis Caswell's 1984 classic, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/c64/impossible_mission">Impossible Mission</a>, is one way to get me fully onboard <em>very</em> quickly.</p>
<p>As soon as I started tumbling (awkwardly slowly) over robotic enemies and waiting impatiently for trundling lifts to move up and down, I knew I was in dream town. And I'm not even being sarcastic. This plays exactly how I remember the game it's aping, and whilst Lumo 2 does have some presentation issues on Switch - it's a little blurry at times - the selection of game tributes it presents, as your huge-hatted protagonist bounds through and snaps up a series of satisfyingly tricky collectibles, are all on-point mechanically. Hooray!</p>
<p>Depending on who you are, though, it may be sort of a half-hooray. The homages are <em>so</em> on-point that they're going to alienate some by their very nature. They're tough, and this isometric malarkey is no joke — believe me, I fought in the original Isometric Wars. Lumo 2, just as was the case with the first, sticks to all the retro trappings. Your avatar is slow and cumbersome; that's intentional. Deaths come thick and fast, sometimes because of the camera angle being tricky to judge at points; that's also meant to be the case.</p>
<p>I think it's great, but you see the potential issue! It's not a game for everyone, by any means. You'll also be losing out by not getting all the references, cameos, little nods and jokes along the way as you play through a generous helping of around 100 retro-inspired levels.</p>
<p>However, if, like me, you love a bit of the rough and tumble of proper old-school isometric stuff; stuff like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nes/marble_madness">Marble Madness</a> or <strong>Ant Attack</strong>, whilst also getting blasted with the occasional side-scrolling/3D surprise, and with plenty of tricky rubber duckie collectibles and in-game achievements to tick off as you go, I'd say Lumo 2 is a return that gives us more of the very-satisfying same. Oh, and you can play it Welsh, so bonus points all round!</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Lumo 2, just like its predecessor, does a great job of reintroducing players to a whole bunch of retro delights from the 1980s, and in small enough servings that they don't outstay their welcome. There's an impressive array of tricky isometric levels to get stuck into besting here, plenty of collectibles and achievements to tick off, some nice side-scrolling surprises along the way, and a general retro-british vibe that you can't help but love infusing the entire thing. Whilst it may not meaningfully evolve its predecessor, Lumo 2 is yet more of the good stuff.</p></section>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Less than two months after the <a href="https://wccftech.com/no-mans-sky-voyagers-update-rebuilds-ship-building/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Voyagers update</a>, Hello Games is launching BREACH, a new free update for No Man's Sky. The British indie developer said Voyagers was a huge success, with the highest player numbers ever recorded in the game. </p>



<p>Naturally, they hope to continue this streak with BREACH, which introduces space wrecks for players to explore. This allows them to experience the thrill of spacewalking in No Man's Sky. Salvaging these wrecks will unlock a wide range of new ship-building parts, which fans have regularly requested for some time. Hello Games also improved and expanded the ship-building feature after seeing players spend so much time designing their dream ships in the game's workshop.</p>



<p>BREACH also adds a new Expedition where players traverse a desolate and abandoned universe and discover what happened to a mysterious wreck. To salvage from the wreckage of the ill-fated ship and add unique parts and modules to your ship-building workshop, they will have no choice but to voyage to the very edge of space.</p>



<p>Such space shipwrecks have begun to appear throughout the far reaches of space, and the bravest Travellers who are prepared to scavenge from them will be rewarded with new parts, including new vertical and structural ones, which will enable the creation of colossal ships, as well as rare, glowing, Atlas-themed wings, engines, and features.</p>



<p>The BREACH Expedition also brings No Man's Sky players together to explore strange, purple-star solar systems. The developers reckon the planets in these systems are particularly enjoyable to explore due to their deep oceans, incredible terrain, and volatile gas giants. The Expedition also features a spooky story, and it's the perfect time for it with Halloween coming up next week.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/this-1800w-anker-power-station-with-200w-solar-panel-drops-50-off-say-goodbye-to-winter-outages-2000638147</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/this-1800w-anker-power-station-with-200w-solar-panel-drops-50-off-say-goodbye-to-winter-outages.1331395/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Winter storms, ice buildup and grid overload during cold snaps can knock out power for hours or even days and leave you scrambling for ways to keep essential devices running. The <strong>Anker Solix C1000</strong> portable power station bundled with a 200W solar panel tackles this exact problem and <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4924/">Amazon just slashed it to an all-time low of $671, down from $1,299)</a>. This combo gives you 1,056 watt-hours of backup capacity with the <strong>ability to recharge from the sun</strong>, which means you can keep your furnace controls, internet router, medical devices or space heaters running during an outage.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4924/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Perfect Solution During Wintertime Disasters</h2>
<p>The <strong>1,800-watt continuous power through SurgePad technology</strong> (which peaks to 2,400 watts) covers almost all appliances you would have to power through the duration of a blackout. That surge ability accommodates power startup demands of refrigerators or battery-powered heaters which frequently have 2-3 times their operating wattage for 1-2 seconds the moment they are switched on.</p>
<p>The 1,056 watt-hour LiFePO4 battery has a rating of well over 3,000 charge cycles before the battery falls to 80% capacity. In practical terms, if you discharge and charge this station once each week, you’ll have spirited performance well into the 10-year term. LiFePO4 chemistry has far better stability than typical lithium-ion, owing to increased cold-temperature handling and far lower propensity toward thermal runaway.</p>



<p>UltraFast mode charges the station to 80% capacity in 43 minutes and <strong>full power in 58 minutes</strong> on the connection of AC power and by the activation of the Anker app. That gives you the ability to recharge fast whenever there are fleeting interludes of power availability and the next blackout approaches. Normal power stations take 6-8 hours to be fully charged, and this does not help much where the grid power remains unstable.</p>
<p>This <strong>200W solar panel included makes this truly an off-grid solution</strong>: Monocrystalline cells of 23% efficiency draw significantly more power from ambient sun than older polycrystalline panels, which rarely achieve higher than 15-17% efficiency. You have four adjustable pitch angles of 30, 40, 50, and 80 degrees, allowing you to dial in the best position relative to the sun’s arc throughout the day and throughout the seasons.</p>



<p><strong>IP67 weatherproof grading</strong> of the panel means it won’t fail because of snow, rain, or dust. You’ll be able to leave it outdoors even for charging periods should the weather shift, but you’ll still have to cover the power station unit itself, which lacks a rating for direct exposure.</p>
<p>With <strong>11 total ports including six AC outlets</strong>, you can run multiple devices simultaneously without needing power strips or prioritizing what stays on. During a winter outage, this means keeping your router and modem online for communication, charging phones and laptops, running a CPAP machine overnight and powering a small space heater in one room, all from the same unit. The variety of ports <strong>(AC, USB-A, USB-C, car outlet)</strong> accommodates everything from full-size appliances down to small electronics without adapters.</p>
<p>At $671 for both the power station and solar panel, you’re looking at less than half the original $1,299 price. Comparable systems with similar capacity and solar charging capability typically run $900-1,200 even on sale.</p>

<p>Kenny Sun’s genius Ball X Pit is a fresh take on the roguelike genre with block-busting and ball-bouncing mechanics. Funnily enough, the Ball X Pit trophy list is sure to have you bouncing from wall to wall to clear out its exhausting list of accomplishments.</p>



<p>Each game’s trophy list ranges from story-related trophies to wacky out out-there tasks you’d never even think to do. We’d argue that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ball-x-pit-reaches-a-major-sales-milestone-days-after-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ball X Pit</a>‘s trophy list is a long but simple one—you need to grind more than if you played every Tony Hawk’s game back to back.</p>



<p>It’s to be expected with roguelikes, so let’s take a deeper dive into <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ball-x-pit-xbox-game-pass-playstation-plus/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ball X Pit</a>‘s trophy list and achievements.</p>



<h2 id="h-all-ball-x-pit-trophies-amp-achievements">All Ball X Pit Trophies &amp; Achievements</h2>

<p>Adjust your eyes when reading this list, as the onslaught of caps might make your eyes sore. But once you start dissecting the entire Ball X Pit trophy list, you’ll see the achievements and trophies are very attainable.</p>



<p>But completing all areas with different characters and collecting resources for the game’s construction aspect is likely to set you back a lot of hours.</p>



<p>Here’s the <a href="https://www.ballxpit.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Ball X Pit</a> trophy list in full.</p>

<p>The latest United States (US) video game hardware sales data for September 2025 has been released, and the Nintendo Switch 2 continues its impressive run since launch.</p>



<p>According to industry firm <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3m3rvmuvpws25" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Circana</a>, the Switch 2 has led the hardware sales to jump 24% to $324 million year over year in September. In terms of year-to-date numbers, hardware sales are up 20% to $3.18 billion.</p>



<p>The continued success of the Switch 2 should come as no surprise. A <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-production-pipeline-boost/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recent report</a> has even suggested that Nintendo has requested an increase in console production to 25 million units over the next six months. </p>



<p>The next official update on Switch 2 unit sales is expected to come during the company’s upcoming earnings call on November 4.</p>



<p>Away from Nintendo, the PlayStation 5 (PS5) maintained its second spot in terms of both units and dollars sold. The Xbox Series, as expected, finished third. Those systems, however, have seen “double-digit year-on-year percentage declines”.</p>



<p>Moving on to accessories, those fell by 10% year-over-year to $197 million. Year to date has sales are down 6% to $1.83 billion. Looking at specific hardware, the midnight black PS5 DualSense wireless controller was the best-selling accessory for September, while the Nintendo Switch 2 Pro remains the best-selling accessory for the year. </p>

                <p>A veteran high-ranking game developer has sounded off on the use of artificial intelligence systems in gaming, saying developers who fail to adopt the technology run the risk of selling themselves short. <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/former-god-of-war-dev-on-the-use-of-ai-in-games-development-if-we-dont-embrace-it-were-selling-ourselves-short" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Speaking to IGN</a>, former Sony Santa Monica director of product development Meghan Morgan Juinio said AI is a "tool" and "something that will augment" human creators, not replace them.</p><p>"At least for right now, that's how I see it. It's going to evolve whether you're on board with it or not, so I want to be at the forefront of helping to guide how that goes and how we use it," Juinio said.</p><p>She added: "I think if we don't embrace it, I think we're selling ourselves short."</p><p>Juinio went on to say that developers in the video game industry have been using forms of generative AI for decades already, singling out the SpeedTree tool that was used all the way back in 2006 to help populate the foliage in The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion. Developers have used procedurally generated and handcrafted assets in development processes for a long time already and generative AI could be the next evolution of that, she said.</p><p>Just because a developer can use generative AI doesn't necessarily mean they should, however, Juinio said.</p><p>"I think as leaders in the video game industry it is on us to figure out not just <em>can </em>we do it with AI, but <em>should </em>we? And it's a case-by-case type of decision making process and what's true for game X might not be true next year for game Y," she explained.</p><p>Finally, Juinio said games today absolutely need human developers to form the ideas of a given project, mentioning that God of War's story is a "human story that is based on human experiences."</p><p>Juinio is not the only prominent game developer to believe that adopting AI can help the video game industry. Masahiro Sakurai, who is best known for creating the Kirby franchise and for his work on the Super Smash Bros. series, has said <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/aaa-game-development-is-unsustainable-but-generative-ai-can-help-smash-bros-boss-says/1100-6532667/" data-ref-id="1100-6532667">the AAA game development scene is unsustainable but that AI can help.</a> Dead Space co-creator Glen Schofield, meanwhile, believes <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ai-can-help-save-the-broken-beaten-battered-games-industry-dev-says/1100-6535516/" data-ref-id="1100-6535516">AI can help save the "broken, beaten, battered" games industry.</a></p><p>Sony has been using AI tools for game development for years, crediting machine learning systems for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstations-plan-to-use-ai-to-speed-up-development-started-with-spider-man-2/1100-6526809/" data-ref-id="1100-6526809">helping speed up development on Marvel's Spider-Man 2.</a> EA Sports said <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-says-cfb-25-would-not-have-been-as-good-without-the-developers-using-ai/1100-6525428/" data-ref-id="1100-6525428">CFB 25 might not have turned out as good without the developers using machine-learning and AI.</a></p><p>Meanwhile, Candy Crush developers who got laid off by Activision Blizzard said they are <a href="https://mobilegamer.biz/laid-off-king-staff-set-to-be-replaced-by-the-ai-tools-they-helped-build-say-sources/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">being replaced by AI tools they helped create.</a> A recent report from <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/61cef75e-ceba-43ee-80e3-040756c6154f" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Financial Times</a> said EA might look to further implement AI systems to help ramp up development amid its <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/unpacking-eas-55-billion-sale-to-go-private-what-does-it-all-mean/1100-6535168/" data-ref-id="1100-6535168">private sale to an investor consortium.</a> Workers at EA have <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-employees-slam-55-billion-buyout-in-open-letter/1100-6535484/" data-ref-id="1100-6535484">blasted the proposed sale</a> over a range of concerns, including the possibility of mass layoffs and studio closures.</p><p>Regarding concerns from workers about AI across the global games industry overall, 30% of developers cited in the survey mentioned above said <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/study-finds-majority-of-game-dev-companies-use-generative-ai-already-despite-worker-concerns/1100-6528919/" data-ref-id="1100-6528919">they believe generative AI is having a negative impact on the video game business</a> (up 12% from 2023). The surveyed developers cited things like IP theft, energy consumption, and AI program biases as contributing to their feelings toward generative AI.</p>

                <p>With the PS5 turning five years old in November, discussion about its successor has begun to intensify. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sonys-future-console-tech-teases-a-glimpse-of-the-ps6-but-its-all-simulated-for-now/1100-6535332/">Sony and AMD recently spoke about new technological breakthroughs</a> that it was pioneering, and former SIE Worldwide Studios president Shuhei Yoshida has shared his thoughts on the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-6-everything-we-know-about-sonys-next-generation-console/1100-6533561/" data-ref-id="1100-6533561">rumored PS6</a> and how Sony needs to do more than just chase graphics for its next-generation console.</p><p>Speaking on the <a href="https://youtu.be/bs7KLs8krho?t=4033" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Friends Per Second podcast</a>, Yoshida explained how the graphical capabilities of current-gen hardware were starting to hit a wall and that the company needs to start thinking beyond pure graphical power to attract a wide audience. "PlayStation--in my mind--they can't do the same thing they have been doing, increasing the graphics power and providing the high-end experiences," Yoshida said. "They might just do that, but still, that feels like a niche audience right now."</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bs7KLs8krho" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/bs7KLs8krho" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>While Yoshida doesn't know what he'd do to make the PS6 stand out if he were still at PlayStation, he did stress that he was confident that the current leadership of the company--led by CEO Hideaki Nishino--is capable of bringing something "disruptive" to the industry, thanks to them being relatively young in comparison to the previous management generation.</p><p>What the proposed PS6 will eventually look like remains to be seen, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ps6-will-go-modular-with-optional-disc-drive-report/1100-6534538/" data-ref-id="1100-6534538">but it has been reported that Sony is considering</a> a detachable disc drive option for it, similar to the one that can be attached to the current PS5 Pro Digital Edition and PS5 Pro consoles. One area where Sony is also looking to keep things old school is the "local execution" of games that comes from a physical disc or having the software for it installed on the SSD. Sony says it <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/for-ps6-sony-is-betting-on-hardware-power-not-the-cloud/1100-6532420/">will continue to rely on hardware over cloud technology</a> in this area of console design.</p><p>Sony's rival, Microsoft, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-president-reconfirms-next-gen-xbox-hardware-is-in-development/1100-6535554/">is banking on a powerful next-generation Xbox</a> to win fans over, as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-next-xbox-will-be-high-end-with-a-curated-experience-xbox-president-says/1100-6535604/">Xbox President Sarah Bond teased</a> a "high-end curated experience" for users.</p>

            <p>It's been a big old year for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/no-mans-sky">No Man's Sky</a>, but developer Hello Games isn't done yet. Today brings space wreck salvaging and more to the exploratory space sim as part of its new Breach update.</p>
<p>Breach builds upon the space-walking feature introduced in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/no-mans-sky-adds-fully-customisable-multi-crew-spaceships-you-can-build-and-fly-with-your-friends">August's massive Voyagers update</a>, introducing huge wrecks adrift among the stars for players to orbit in search of valuable salvage. In turn, salvage is used to unlock a "huge array" of new ship building components - including vertical and structural elements, and rare, glowing Atlas-themed parts - which arrive alongside improved and expanded ship building options.</p>
<p>Breach also marks the start of a brand-new limited-time Expedition, featuring a variety of new cosmetic rewards. This time, players are set loose in an abandoned universe, full of rare purple-star solar systems, in search of a mysterious wreck. Expect gas giants, ocean planets, and a spooky, seasonally appropriate story. You'll find <a href="https://www.nomanssky.com/2025/10/expedition-twenty-breach/">full patch notes</a> on Hello Games' website.</p>

<p>All this follows a 2025 that's brought some major additions to No Man's Sky, including those aforementioned <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/no-mans-sky-gets-storm-ravaged-gas-giants-and-trillions-of-new-planets-in-another-major-overhaul">purple-star systems</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/no-mans-skys-latest-update-lets-you-dig-for-prehistoric-bones-and-assemble-them-into-weird-skeletal-displays">palaeontology</a>, a <a href="https://eurogamer.net/no-mans-sky-getting-a-free-switch-2-launch-day-update-adding-fancier-visuals-multiplayer-and-more">massive Switch 2 release</a>, and customisable Corvette ships - the latter update helping propel the space sim to its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/no-mans-sky-boss-so-happy-as-sim-celebrates-highest-steam-player-count-since-launch-and-fans-go-wild-with-new-ship-customisation">highest Steam player count since launch</a>.</p><p>"It has been a crazy year for the No Man's Sky team and we're so proud and pleased to be able to continue working on this game we all love so much nine years after launch," Hello Games's boss Sean Murray said as part of today's Breach announcement. "Seeing so many folks enjoying Voyagers has really inspired us, and we can't wait for you to see what we have in store in future."</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>

<p>We've seen countless methods over the years in which players have made wild contraptions to help grind battles and progression, and this latest from YouTuber <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@ProfessorRex">Professor Rex</a> is pretty elaborate.</p>
<p>As covered by <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/pokemon-legends-z-a-player-grinds-shiny-charms-1000-battle-requirement-using-3d-printer-contraption/">Automaton</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pokemon-legends-z-a-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a> players will need to complete 1,000 battles as part of the requirements for the coveted Shiny Charm. So, rather than just play the game like normal, Professor Rex has instead utilised a 3D printer to complete the battles automatically.</p>
<p>So essentially, they've got a controller with 'A' set to Turbo, meaning holding it down will result in continuous inputs. This is placed in a makeshift holder to keep the button pressed down, while a Prusa Mach 4 3D printer is able to periodically press the 'ZL' button.</p>
<p>This translates into the game pretty well, allowing the protagonist to immediately lock-on to enemy Pokémon with 'ZL' while attacking automatically with 'A'.</p>
<p>Is it a good idea..? Well, look, it's a <em>clever</em> idea, at least. We're not altogether convinced that it's the best use of someone's time, though. We understand the lure of shiny Pokémon, but goodness, you're potentially missing out on so much gameplay if you just let a machine do the job for you.</p>
<p>Different strokes though, eh?</p>

              <p>Amazon is making it a great time to expand your Lego Harry Potter collection, or even start one. We’ve been spotting several Wizarding World sets going for less recently. One of our favorite deals? <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4920/">The Lego Hogwarts Castle Owlery set, which is now priced at $36 on Amazon, after a 20% off from its regular price.</a></p>
<p>You’re saving a nice $9 while bringing one of the most iconic locations from the Harry Potter movies straight to your home. It’s going to look great on its own, but we’d suggest pairing it with one of the castle sets for a fuller Hogwarts setup. Just note that discounts on Lego sets aren’t common, and the ones that do pop up don’t usually stick around for long. If you have been wanting to relive your favorite memories from the movies you grew up watching, now is the time to act.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4920/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Makes for a Fun Weekend Project</h2>
<p>This set is designed for ages 8 and up, and gets you a total of 364 pieces. For a bit of a memory refresh, this tower is where Harry broke a lot of hearts back in the day by inviting Cho Chang to the Yule Ball (guilty), and also where the Hogwarts owls reside. You will find three Lego minifigures inside the box, including Harry Potter, Cho Chang, and Argus Filch, plus five adorable owl figures, including Pigwidgeon. There are window ledges for the owls to perch, and even some accessories to care for the smart messengers.</p>



<p>Each set also includes one of 14 collectible Hogwarts portraits. And if you plan on building a larger Lego Hogwarts setup, this one is part of a series of modular sets (each sold separately) that connect to form the most complete Hogwarts display to date. As we mentioned earlier, most other sets are discounted too, meaning you can grab a few for your setup without paying the full price right now!</p>
<p>The set comes with an instruction book that walks you through each step, one at a time. Compared with other similar builds, this one’s fairly simple to put together. But, if you prefer more detailed guidance, we recommend using the Lego Builder app for 3D instructions. It also lets you track your progress as you go.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4920/">It’s a limited-time discount, which is why we recommend acting fast to grab your set. Maybe you can treat yourself to it, or gift it to a Harry Potter fan in your life.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4920/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Former Bethesda developer Bruce Nesmith has offered his thoughts on the divisive <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/starfield">Starfield</a>, insisting if it has been released by any other studio “it would have been received differently.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking to <a href="https://frvr.com/blog/starfield-designer-says-sci-fi-rpg-still-a-great-game-but-procedural-generation-stopped-fallout-elder-scrolls/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">FRVR</a>, the former Starfield systems designer admitted that the sci-fi RPG is “not in the same calibre” as Bethesda’s much-loved The Elder Scrolls and Fallout franchises, but insisted it was still “a great game.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I think it’s a good game,” Nesmith, who left Bethesda around a year before Starfield came out, said. “I don’t think it’s in the same calibre as the other two, you know, Fallout or Skyrim, or Elder Scrolls rather, but I think it’s a good game. I worked on it, I’m proud of the work I did. I’m proud of the work that the people I knew did on it. I think they made a great game.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">When “the studio that gave you Skyrim and Fallout makes a space game,” Nesmith said, there are certain “expectations,” and these weren’t met. “If the same game had been released by not Bethesda, it would have been received differently,” Nesmith insisted.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Starfield launched in September 2023 as Bethesda’s first brand new IP in 25 years, but it was not as well received as the studio’s previous games in the Fallout and The Elder Scrolls franchises, and the Shattered Space expansion, released a year later in September 2024, has a ‘mostly negative’ user review rating on Steam.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Starfield went on to reach 15 million players, but the question of whether Bethesda might walk away from the game to focus on its other franchises has been a running theme since release. In June 2024, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bethesda-isnt-walking-away-from-starfield-its-planning-a-second-story-expansion-for-year-2"><u>Bethesda insisted it remained committed to supporting Starfield</u></a>, and confirmed at least one other story expansion would come out following Shattered Space. And in an interview with <a href="https://youtu.be/2ew8LQFGNWU?feature=shared" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>YouTube channel MrMattyPlays</u></a>, Bethesda Game Studios’ Todd Howard said the developer was aiming to release an annual story expansion for “hopefully a very long time.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">That, obviously, hasn't happened. In August, it was reported that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/starfield-reportedly-set-for-ps5-release-during-spring-2026-alongside-new-expansion"><u>Starfield's second expansion and much-anticipated PlayStation 5 port would now arrive in 2026</u></a>, following the poor reception to Shattered Space.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So, what went wrong? Nesmith pointed to Starfield’s reliance on procedural generation as a problem, as opposed to the lack of real-time space travel, which he described as “inherently boring.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“But when the planets start to feel very samey and you don’t start to feel the excitement on the planets, that’s to me where it falls apart,” he continued. “I was also disappointed when, pretty much, the only serious enemy you fought were people… there’s lots of cool alien creatures, but they’re like the wolves in Skyrim. They’re just there, they don’t contribute, you don’t have the variety of serious opponents that are story generators.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/following-datamine-leak-bethesda-confirms-starfield-space-gameplay-revamp-to-make-the-travels-there-more-rewarding"><u>Bethesda has confirmed plans to improve Starfield space gameplay “to make the travels there more rewarding”</u></a> after datamined fragments of code suggested the developer had a more streamlined space travel experience in the works. Based on this datamine, while you may be able to travel between planets within the same system, you won’t be able to fly all the way between systems, nor fly directly from a planet's surface into orbit, like No Man's Sky.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In a new video discussing his career, veteran Bethesda developer Tim Lamb confirmed that the studio had been working on Starfield’s space gameplay, and that a new DLC story was still coming at some point.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I think as it comes to Starfield, I'm really excited for players to see what the teams have been working on,” he said. “We have some cool stuff coming, including free updates and features the players have been asking for, as well as a new DLC story.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I can't go into all the details just yet, but I will say part of the team has been focused on space gameplay to make the travels there more rewarding. We're also adding some new game systems, and a few other smaller delights. There's also some really interesting stuff coming down the pipe from our verified creators. There's some fun stuff.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I just want to say thanks. We really appreciate the support and the enthusiasm. We can't wait to get it into the hands of our players.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Last month, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bethesda-teases-terran-armada-on-starfield-2-year-anniversary-sending-fans-down-a-speculation-rabbit-hole">Bethesda teased new content for <u>Starfield</u></a> — at least that’s what fans thought after they spotted a hidden message in a social media video released to celebrate the game’s two-year anniversary.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.

<p>The Control spin-off live-service game has not reached the studio's internal targets "despite improved player and sales metrics" after recent updates.</p>
<p>Back in August, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/remedy-unsatisfied-with-fbc-firebreak-sales-as-subscription-console-players-exceed-those-on-pc">Remedy said it was "unsatisfied" with sales of FBC: Firebreak</a>, particularly due to its underperformance on Steam.</p>
<p>"FBC: Firebreak was designed as a game that evolves over time," said Virtala at the time. "Despite the rocky launch, we believe we have a solid game to build on. Players who spent over an hour with the game reviewed the game mostly positive - showing us that the core experience of the game is entertaining."</p>
<p>Virtala will continue at Remedy in a transitional capacity.</p>
<p>"I want to thank Tero Virtala for his substantial contribution to the management of Remedy since 2016. I personally thank Tero for good cooperation and wish him all the best for the future," said Mäki</p>
<p>FBC: Firebreak is the company's first online multiplayer game, following its celebrated single-player games.</p>
<p>In August, Remedy confirmed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/control-2">Control 2</a> development is "on track", while the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/max-payne">Max Payne</a> 1 &amp; 2 remake project is also in full production.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/alan-wake-2">Alan Wake 2</a>, meanwhile, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/alan-wake-2-is-finally-profitable-over-a-year-after-release-says-remedy">finally became profitable a year after its release</a>.</p>

		<p>Tero Virtala, CEO of Remedy Entertianment, has stepped down with immediate effect, in mutual agreement with the company’s Board of Directors. Markus Mäki, one of the studio’s founders and Chairman of the Board up until this point, is shifting across to be interim CEO, and Board member Henri Österlund is stepping up to be the new Chairman.</p>
<p>Remedy’s interim CEO Markus Mäki said, “I want to thank Tero Virtala for his substantial contribution to the management of Remedy since 2016. I personally thank Tero for good cooperation and wish him all the best for the future.”</p>


<p>The change of leadership comes a few weeks after <a href="https://investors.remedygames.com/releases-and-events/announcements-and-releases/?publicationId=b4d23a32-03e7-49e5-bbc3-93ec062699a5">Remedy revised their financial outlook</a>, off the back of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/fbc-firebreak">FBC: Firebreak’s</a> underperformance. Having launched in June, the game immediately struggled, with Remedy working to bring major overhauls to their first live service title. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/09/30/fbc-firebreak-drops-its-first-major-update-today-bringing-new-missions-enemies-and-mods-to-the-game/">This launched on 29th September</a>, but despite bringing “improved player and sales metrics after the update, sales have not reached Remedy’s internal targets.”&nbsp;This leaves the company with “a non-cash impairment of capitalized development costs and allocated purchased publishing and distribution rights related to FBC: Firebreak.”</p>
<p>A Q3 2025 business review will come on 29h October to provide a broader picture of the studio’s development efforts and future outlook.</p>
<p>Remedy enjoyed many highs through Virtala’s tenure as CEO, who joined the company just as they were looking for new independence and impetus after a long period of working exclusively with Microsoft. That included a first IPO to secure funding to grow into a multi-game studio, &nbsp;and to partnerships with 505 Games and Smilegate in the early years. This, in turn, produced the major hit for the company that was <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/08/26/control-review-ps4-xbox-pc/">Control</a> (and the easily forgotten dud that was <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/crossfirex">CrossfireX</a>), and the company rode that momentum to gain new partnerships and investment. A significant deal with Epic Games brought the Alan Wake Remastered and a slick and very well received horror sequel in Alan Wake 2. They’ve also secured funding for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/control-2">Control 2,</a> and bought back rights to go it alone.</p>

<p>In the name of diversifying their portfolio, Remedy ventured into multiplayer gaming with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/07/07/fbc-firebreak-review/">FBC: Firebreak</a>, but the game has underperformed, and alongside slower sales for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/10/26/alan-wake-2-review/">Alan Wake 2</a> that outside observers might have expected, put a bit of a dent into their status on the stock market. Since nearly hitting share prices of €50 in 2021, they’ve slid back down to around €13.</p>
<p>To be clear, Remedy’s new outlook is that revenue will still increase over last year, but that operating profit from ongoing development projects will be negative. The push is now to forge ahead with work on the Max Payne remakes and Control 2, with more details on these to come at next week’s business review.</p>

			<p>Back in the ancient past of the late 20th century there was a real push towards games emulating animated films. While this was generally more a matter of marketing spiel than anything substantial, the true pioneer of this approach was the classic (albeit terrible) Dragon’s Lair, a game which used the beautiful animation of Don Bluth to stitch together gameplay that was more akin to a lengthy QTE than anything else. The timeless nature of this approach means that the original game still holds up visually to this day. Modern gaming has taken a turn towards hyper-realism with the increase in processing power, so Bye Sweet Carole stands out as much as Dragon’s Lair did, for different reasons.</p>
<p><iframe title="Bye Sweet Carole - Launch Trailer | Available Now!" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4CsIxYSRkfM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>You can’t discuss Bye Sweet Carole without beginning with the aesthetics. The animated style – far more reminiscent to me of Don Bluth than the comparisons to Disney that are being thrown around – is stunning and gives the game a truly unique character which feels deliberately at odds with the darker and more sinister aspects of the game. Characters and backgrounds are memorable and distinctive, whilst enemies flow in a creepy and sludgy way. The level of detail is admirable and the relatively compact world becomes easy to navigate and explore.</p>


<p>Music and voice acting are also strong here, with a fully voiced script and music that is both atmospheric and emotional, perfectly fitting the game’s touching narrative. While you can skip the dialogue (useful for when you have to rewatch scenes after deaths) it is well worth letting them play out the first time – there’s even an achievement for doing so.</p>


<p>The story of Bye Sweet Carole feels like a true coming of age (or bildungsroman as we call it in the literary trade). The titular Carole is absent from the game, with the plot revolving around her best friend, Lana, attempting to discover how she disappeared, and eventually coming to terms with life without her. This is an emotional story of friendship, grief, and loss that is made even more interesting by being wrapped up in the context of the early 20th century suffragette movement. The shifts in expectations and hopes for young women during this time provide a crucial backdrop to the events.</p>
<p>So far, so glowingly positive, and I would definitely recommend playing Bye Sweet Carole for all the experiences described above but the gameplay is a bit more of a mixed bag.</p>

<p>The ‘survival horror’ tag applied Bye Sweet Carole is somewhat misleading, as what we have is more of a classic point and click adventure game mixed with some underwhelming platforming and stealth horror sections. The adventure side of things is well designed and features some really nice puzzles that offer enough challenge to keep your interest without becoming frustrating. The exception to this is a late game puzzle involving time travel and growing a seed, where the dialog prompts led me to believe that the game had broken – a sentiment shared by many in the Steam forums. You’ll spend the game exploring the interior and surroundings of Bunny Hall looking for keys, switching levers and using your ability to change into a rabbit to navigate tight spaces. Progression is well paced and this part of the game remains enjoyable throughout.</p>
<p>Where the game falls down, however, is in the platforming and stealth parts. Lana feels quite stiff to control and it is very easy to slip from a platform and die. Her rabbit form is far more nimble, though, and to be honest I switched to it whenever I was able to. Then there are numerous ledges that require you to balance using the left stick that go on for too long, whilst instadeath stealth sections often feel more random than designed. The latter are very common, although many can be avoided by simply running away. You can hide in lockers and hold the left trigger to hold your breath, but this mechanic is never particularly engaging and feels tacked on.</p>

<p>The biggest issue for me, however, was the enforced stealth sections that reminded me of Dragon’s Lair for all the wrong reasons, as they felt arbitrary as to whether you would be spotted or not. These were generally being preceded by unskippable cutscenes, which made me resent them even more. I think the idea of blending adventure and action is an interesting one, but the balance here is just off.</p>

	<div id="gp-summary">
		<p>Summary</p><p>
		Bye Sweet Carole is a curate’s egg of a game, with the presentation being truly superb and the storytelling excellent, but the bulk of the game experience just isn’t fun. The frustrating platforming and stealth, combined with the review build being quite buggy, led to me finishing the game with gritted teeth rather than enjoyment. The bugs can be fixed (and the devs are working on patches) but the imbalance between the two gameplay styles is a more fundamental issue. If you can see past this then the game has a lot to offer in terms of aesthetic and story but, ironically, these can be enjoyed through watching a playthrough without subjecting yourself to the frustration.	</p></div>

			<p>A new PlayStation 5 system software update, version 25.07-12-20-00, is now live.

              <p><em>Luigi’s Mansion</em>, the original game in the glorious ghost-hunting series, was a launch title released for the GameCube in 2001. However, beyond a remake on the much underloved 3DS in 2018, the 24-year-old classic has long been tough to play without using emulation. And it’s worth playing, because it’s completely brilliant! So it’s tremendous news that on October 30, the game is being added to the GameCube collection on what’s now called Nintendo Classics, available to anyone with a Switch 2 and the expanded subscription.</p> <p>OK, admittedly I’m struggling with the fact that I remember playing this game on release like it was a decade ago, not two and a half of them, but my own battle with linear time aside, this is all good news. It’s wild to me that <em>Luigi’s Mansion</em> hasn’t been ported to every Nintendo console since, given just what a stone-cold classic the third-person ghost-vacuuming game truly is.</p>

 <p>Poor Luigi, ever trembling in the shadow of his brave brother, is notified that luck is finally going his way, and he’s won a mansion! Except, he never entered the contest, and it turns out the place is a haunted wreck. Thankfully, Professor Elvin Gadd has made a base in the place (presumably squatting?), although he explains the building only popped into existence a few days earlier. Oh, and Mario’s trapped inside. So Luigi, using E. Gadd’s Poltergust 3000 vacuum cleaner, sets about clearing the mansion of its ghostly inhabitants.</p>

  <p>The game received a fairly frosty reception from some on its release in 2001 (<em>GameSpot</em> called it the most disappointing game of the year!), partly based on its relatively short length (it comes in under 10 hours), and partly because it wasn’t a&nbsp;<em>Mario</em> game. Much like the Switch 2 launching with a <em>Donkey Kong</em> title and not the expected new&nbsp;<em>Super Mario</em> extravaganza, the GameCube similarly confused the masses with a Luigi-led project that was an entirely new type of game from Nintendo. It wouldn’t be until almost a year later that <em>Super Mario Sunshine</em> came out to fill that gap, and <em>GameSpot</em> called that the most disappointing game of the year, too!</p>

 <p>Anyway, all those moaners were wrong, and judged not as a substitute for a <em>Super Mario</em> game but as something very different in its own right, <em>Luigi’s Mansion</em> shines. It’s quite easy (apart from the stupidly hard final boss), it’s relatively short, and it’s very, very funny, and that’s what it was setting out to be.</p>

 <p>It is, however, worth noting that this addition is the original game, and not the much prettier 2018 3DS remake, which itself now wallows in the sad misery of abandonware.</p> <p>If you have the Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack subscription (oh <em>please</em> can Nintendo give that a new name too?), you’ll find that <em>Luigi’s Mansion</em> will appear in the GameCube section of Nintendo Classics this October 30, just in time for spooky season.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Ball X Pit is a late contender for various GOTY awards as it’s wowed everyone with its unique take on the block breaker genre. If you want to try it out for yourself, you need to know if Ball X Pit is on Xbox Game Pass or PlayStation Plus, as it might save you a buck or two.</p>



<p>From the 80s to Bust-A-Bloc on the PS2, the block breaker game has been around for decades. It’s appeared in all shapes and sizes (usually with a sphere or two), and the genre has finally been turned on its head with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ball-x-pit-reaches-a-major-sales-milestone-days-after-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ball X Pit</a>. Kenny Sun has looked to emulate other successful solo developers such as Baltotr’s LocalThunk or Animal Well’s Billy Basso.</p>



<p>Ball X Pit smashed bricks and expectations with its glorious reviews and early backing from hundreds of thousands of players. If you want to add to this growing community, Game Pass or PS Plus might be your gateway.</p>

<figure><figcaption>Short but sweet runs aplenty. Credit to Kenny Sun</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>You can play Ball X Pit for free if you have an Xbox Game Pass Ultimate membership right now.</strong></p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xbox-game-pass-wave-1-october-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wave 1 of October 2025’s free Xbox Game Pass Games</a> included Ball X Pit. You can’t really ask for better promotion and publicity for a new indie game than one of the most popular gaming streaming services in the world offering it out for free to all subscribers.</p>



<p>This allows all eyes to be on Ball X Pit, and plenty of those eyes will turn into players.</p>



<p>The Game Pass discourse hasn’t been pretty in late 2025. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xbox-founder-describes-game-pass-price-hikes-as-greed-over-gaming/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Xbox’s founder has described the infamous Game Pass Price hikes as ‘greed over gaming,’</a> and it’s also been suggested that Microsoft <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ftc-chair-shots-game-pass-price-hike/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">‘can make things worse.’</a></p>



<p>Regardless, for anyone who’s still subscribed, you can play Ball X Pit (among many other titles) for free as part of your subscription.</p>



<h2 id="h-can-you-play-ball-x-pit-free-on-playstation-plus">Can You Play Ball X Pit Free On PlayStation Plus?</h2>



<p><strong>Ball X Pit isn’t a fully free and downloadable game on PS Plus like it is on Xbox, but you can play the game for an hour with a free trial via PlayStation Plus Premium to see what you think first.</strong></p>



<p>For the time being, Ball X Pit hasn’t been added to PS Plus Essentials, Extra, or Premium just yet. However, if you want at least some fix on PS5, there’s a free one-hour trial—serving as an extended demo to see if you want to play it for more than an hour. Given the game’s addictiveness, chances are, you will want more.</p>



<p>Should you opt for a full purchase, it will still only set you back $14.99.</p>



<p>If you’ve already played Ball X Pit, via Game Pass, PlayStation Plus, or somewhere else, please let us, and potential buyers, know what you think. Is it worth the investment? Is it the GOTY contender it’s been hyped up to be?

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/borderlands-4">Borderlands 4</a>'s most infamous build will soon be nerfed in an upcoming patch, which will be launching during the Horrors of Kairos in-game event.</p>
<p>Kicking off early next week, the regular Borderlands 4 patch will be released alongside Horrors of Kairos, bringing with it a substantial nerf to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/borderlands-4-best-builds-class-tier-list#section-3">Vex's crit knife build</a>. This build has been making mincemeat of bosses in Borderlands 4 ever since the game's launch back in September, and has become a topic of extensive discussion among the balance-minded in the community.</p>
<p>This balance patch, initially dubbed the "Day 30 Update",<a href="https://x.com/Borderlands/status/1978859303982485815"> was delayed last Thursday</a>. It's bringing with it the aforementioned nerf to the crit knife build, as well as quality of life features and some performance and stability improvements. This is the latest <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/borderlands-4s-worst-character-is-getting-66-buffs-leaked-patch-notes-reveals">in a consistent patch output from Gearbox</a>, which has been steadily tweaking the game since launch.</p>

<p>As for the Horrors of Kairos, it's a free mini-event that'll bring with it new legendary weapons, a seasonal weather variant, and a new pumpkin head cosmetic for all your vault hunters. It's kicking off tomorrow, and is set to run until the 6th November.</p><p>After the Horrors of Kairos event, Borderlands 4 players can look forward to Bounty Pack 1 coming in November. This'll bring a new mission and boss as well as a suite of cosmetic rewards. Before the year is up, Borderlands 4 is due to get another end game boss in the Bloomreaper, as well as additional legendary weapons to farm.</p>
<p>Then, in 2026, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/borderlands-4-details-first-paid-dlc-plans-as-2k-continues-to-struggle-with-pc-performance-issues">the much-anticipated fifth vault hunter is coming</a>! C4SH will come in Q1 with new missions, a new section of the map, side missions, and other goodies. So all in all, with consistent balance updates, plus a mix of paid and free updates coming to the game, it looks as though Borderlands 4 still has plenty of kick left in it.</p>

              <p>Gaming at high frame rates with maxed-out settings doesn’t have to drain your bank account anymore. Asus just dropped a deal on two of its latest powerhouses: the TUF Gaming GeForce <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4923/">RTX 5070 is now down to $584 on Amazon (from $739)</a>, and <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4922/">the RTX 5080 sits at $1,349 (originally $1,599)</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4922/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See RTX 5080 at Amazon</a></p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4923/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See RTX 5070 at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Why Should You Pay Attention to These Cards?</h2>
<p>The RTX 5070 comes equipped with 12GB of GDDR7 memory whih is the most recent generation of graphics memory technology. GDDR7 brings much higher data transfer rates than the older cards’ GDDR6, so textures load sooner, stuttering is reduced, and you enjoy smoother action in memory-hungry titles like Cyberpunk 2077 or Microsoft Flight Simulator. 12GB capacity means you’ll have no VRAM bottlenecks at 1440p or even 4K resolutions in most titles, and provides you with headroom through the next couple of years as titles increasingly require increasing amounts of resources.</p>
<p>The RTX 5070 uses a 3.125-slot design which means it’s slightly thicker than traditional two-slot cards but not quite as massive as some three-slot monsters. This extra space allows for a more robust cooling solution without turning your case into an oven. Asus equips it with axial-tech fans that spin in alternating directions to reduce turbulence and increase airflow efficiency.</p>



<p>Upgrading to the RTX 5080, you’ll be getting 16GB of GDDR7 memory and the more substantial 3.6-slot build. This card aims directly at gamers who won’t compromise, running 4K resolution with ray tracing and still demanding triple-digit frame rates. That extra 4GB of VRAM over the 5070 makes all the difference when you’re gaming at higher resolutions and ultra textures or you’re doing content creation like video editing or 3D rendering on the side. Vapor chamber cooling on the RTX 5080 is an evolution of the older heat pipe technology. Instead of using the latter’s hollow tubes to conduct the heat, the vapor chamber distributes the thermal energy on a wider surface area, keeping the hotspot under control and delivering steady results even through long gaming marathons.</p>



<p>Both boards are PCIe 5.0 capable, doubling the bandwidth of PCIe 4.0. Now, you won’t be seeing huge real-world improvements to gaming these days, but future software and applications are going to be increasingly making use of that extra bandwidth. DisplayPort 2.1 and HDMI connectivity adds future-proof readiness of the next generation of monitors, including those scaling well beyond 4K resolution and higher refresh rates. If you have come to consider one of those new 240Hz 4K monitors, these cards actually have the ability to properly feed themIt manufactures these TUF Gaming cards using military-grade components and provides protective PCB coating.</p>
<p>At $584, the RTX 5070 undercuts what many people paid for last generation’s mid-range cards while delivering current-gen performance and features. The RTX 5080 at $1,349 brings flagship-tier gaming within reach of enthusiasts who don’t want to take out a loan for their hobby. Given that both cards have strong review scores on Amazon (4.7 stars for the 5070 across over 2,000 reviews, and 4.6 stars for the 5080), stock my sell out quickly.</p>

<p>Life continues to find a way, with Jurassic World Evolution 3 marking the latest entry in the series, and there’s a stacked dinosaur list to enjoy.</p>



<p>The major additions from the first two games in the franchise are the debut of baby dinosaurs and much more in-depth building customization, leaning on features that starred in the Planet Zoo and Planet Coaster titles.</p>



<p>While it’s highly unlikely you’ll have room for the complete list of dinosaurs in a single park in Jurassic World Evolution 3, we’ve got the definitive list for you to box off.</p>

<p><strong>Jurassic World Evolution 3 has over 80 prehistoric creatures to care for in it’s full dinosaur list, with the vast majority available with the base game.</strong></p>



<p>However, a select few are Deluxe Edition exclusives, but all the heavy hitters like Tyrannosaurus Rex, Velociraptor, and Stegosaurus are all available. In fact, the list of dinosaurs will get even bigger over time, with Frontier promising to bring back creatures from the first two games that are not included at launch as free post-launch updates.</p>



<p>We’ve got a full breakdown of every dinosaur available in Jurassic World Evolution 3 in the table below, along with the food they require and the number of eggs you can expect to see through breeding.</p>
