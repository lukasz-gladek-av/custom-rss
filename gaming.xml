            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/06/crash-bandicoot-n-sane-trilogy-spins-onto-xbox-game-pass-with-august-update/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Microsoft has announced a small clutch of games coming to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/xbox-game-pass">Xbox Game Pass</a> in the start of August, and it’s the expected <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/crash-bandicoot-n-sane-trilogy">Crash Bandicoot N.Sane Trilogy</a> that is leading the way.</p>
<p>Crash will arrive later this week on 8th August, but is being preceded by the day one launch of Creatures of Ava, and followed next week by Mafia: Definitive Edition.</p>


<h2>Coming to Game Pass in August</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Creatures of Ava</strong> – XSX|S, PC, Cloud – 7th August (Day One)</li>
<li><strong>Crash Bandicoot N. Sane Trilogy</strong> – XSX|S, XBO, PC, Cloud – 8th August</li>
<li><strong>Mafia: Definitive Edition</strong> – XSX|S, XBO, PC, Cloud – 13th August</li>
</ul>
<p>Crash Bandicoot N.Sane Trilogy is a fantastic remake of the original PlayStation platformer trilogy, starring the very radical marsupial in Crash Bandicoot, Crash Bandicoot 2: Cortex Strikes Back and Crash Bandicoot 3: Warped, all completely remade by Vicarious Visions. It’s the latest game from Activision Blizzard’s library of games that is being drip fed onto Game Pass since the company’s acquisition at the end of last year, following on from <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/07/23/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-iii-comes-to-game-pass-july-24th/">COD Modern Warfare 3</a> at the end of last month, and<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/02/15/diablo-4-is-coming-to-game-pass-this-march/"> Diablo 4 all the way back in March</a>.</p>
<p>N.Sane Trilogy is fantastic, though, and we said back with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2017/06/29/crash-bandicoot-n-sane-trilogy-review/">our 2017 review</a> that “As far as remakes go, you can’t get any better than this. Crash Bandicoot N. Sane Trilogy is exactly how fans envisioned it – an unadulterated celebration of a PlayStation pioneer.”</p>


<p>Next week we then have Mafia: Definitive Edition, a similarly ground-up remake by developer Hangar 13, who lifted the original game’s narrative and action and dropped it into their modern engine for Mafia III.</p>
<p>Microsoft are keeping things pretty light in early August, but we can expect a bit more hustle and bustle to Game Pass announcements in the second half of the month, as they look to make a splash at Gamescom 2024.</p>
<p>There’s some pretty sizeable changes coming to Game Pass in the next few months, as well, with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/07/10/xbox-game-pass-gets-price-increases-drops-day-one-games-on-standard-tier/">price hikes and a relaunch of the regular Xbox Game Pass service called Xbox Game Pass Standard</a>. This will now include Xbox online multiplayer, and have the full library of back catalogue games, but will no longer have day one games. This is seemingly a calculated move just to push people to the even higher prices Game Pass Ultimate, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/05/28/the-game-pass-app-has-confirmed-call-of-duty-black-ops-6-for-day-one/">if they want to get Black Ops 6 on day one</a>.</p>

            <p>
A little over a year after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/star-wars-jedi-survivor-coming-to-playstation-4-xbox-one">confirming</a> a last-gen release for Star Wars Jedi: Survivor was in the works, EA has announced the action-adventure sequel will be launching for Xbox One and PS4 on 17th September. Additionally, improvements to the much-maligned PC version are coming.
</p>
<p>
Star Wars Jedi: Survivor initially released for Xbox Series X/S, PS5, and PC last April, picking up its story some five years after the events of 2019's well-recieved Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order. This time around, Jedi Knight Cal Kestis is still picking a fight with the Empire, but developer Respawn has given him new Force tricks and expanded fight styles to help him through.
</p>
<p>
There's more, of course, but third-person sproinging around the gorgeously rendered Star Wars scenery, hitting baddies with lightsabers remains at its core.

<figcaption>This is how it looked on current-gen systems last year.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bmj3ty-Wt48" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>
Eurogamer's Chris Tapsell wasn't entirely convinced by Jedi: Survivor's "hit-and-miss action" when he <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/star-wars-jedi-survivor-review-hit-and-miss-action-with-the-warmest-of-hearts">reviewed it last year</a>, but he still came away pretty positive about Respawn's sequel. "But - and a big but," he wrote, "I can't emphasise this enough - Star Wars: Jedi Survivor remains fundamentally really fun... It is always enjoyable to ping yourself around runnable walls and ziplines and now grapple hooks (I know) like a human pinball. It is much more desirable that Star Wars games have a little goofiness... Its lack of focus is what holds it back - and also what makes it such a blast."
</p>
<p>
Star Wars Jedi: Survivor will cost £49.99/$49.99 USD and feature "a variety of optimisations aimed at maximizing the hardware capabilities of the consoles" when it launches for <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-gb/product/UP0006-CUSA33778_00-APPLEJACKGAME000">PS4</a> and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-us/games/store/star-wars-jedi-survivor-xbox-one/9plrp6phv6xp">Xbox One</a> on 17th September. Pre-orders will receive the Hermit Cosmetic Set (inspired by Obi-Wan Kenobi), Hermit Lightsaber Set, and Combustion Blaster Set.
</p>
<p>
Additionally, EA says the PC version - which Digital Foundry <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsskwVyPoxs">called</a> "the worst PC port of 2023" - will be recieving an update "in the coming weeks". This promises "enhancements to the game's technical performance, controls and more", as well as various quality of life improvements.

It doesn’t seem like <em>Jedi: Survivor </em>wants to attempt the same magic trick. </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p dir="ltr">A small change is made to the new STG44 assault rifle, with an increase to the lower-left-arm damage multiplier from 1.2x to 1.3x. The developer says this adjustment is made to make sure the damage dealt to lower arms is now consistent regardless of which arm is hit.</p><p dir="ltr">The recent buff to the Cor-45 pistol's fire rate made the pistol a popular choice for Season 5, but an adjustment is now made to the gun's XRK IP-V2 conversion kit, which the developer says was previously allowing a faster fire rate than intended.</p><p dir="ltr">The Zombies part of the update addresses an issue that previously caused the last player to Exfil from a match to be queued into another match before viewing the After Action Report. It also patches an exploit involving safes that would allow players to carry more weapons than intended.</p><p dir="ltr">The update is much smaller on the Warzone side, but it does include some impactful weapon balancing.</p><p dir="ltr">The recent addition of the JAK Cataclysm conversion kit made the RPK light machine gun become an overpowered one-shot kill in battle royale. Today's update makes several adjustments to the conversion kit, reducing the damage, damage range, and head modifier to make the gun a three-bullet elimination at the max range, as long as it includes at least one headshot.</p><p dir="ltr">Despite recent nerfs, the Superi 46 submachine was still the most popular close-range option for Warzone. However, the new update looks to decrease the weapon's popularity with a nerf to the gun's damage potential. The near-mid damage is reduced from 29 to 26, and the minimum-damage decreased from 25 to 20.</p><p dir="ltr">The Cor-45 pistol also receives the same adjustment to the gun's XRK IP-V2 conversion kit as mentioned above for multiplayer.</p><p dir="ltr">The full patch notes for <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/patchnotes/2024/07/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-iii-season-5-patch-notes" rel="nofollow ">Modern Warfare 3</a> and <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/patchnotes/2024/07/call-of-duty-mwiii-warzone-season-5-patch-notes" rel="nofollow ">Warzone</a> can be seen below, as shared by Activision.</p><p>Season 5 is currently underway with a WWE-themed crossover, but today is the last day to earn free rewards for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/call-of-duty-wwe-summerslam-event-all-rewards-and-challenges/2900-5648/">the SummerSlam event</a>, including the WWE operator skin.</p><h3>Global</h3><h3>Customization</h3><ul><li>Fixed an issue preventing the Lachmann-762 and TAQ-V Battle Rifles from equipping the Bioluminescent Camo.</li><li>Changed the default Finishing Move for the Rhea Ripley Operator to Riptide.</li></ul><h3>Multiplayer</h3><h3>UIX</h3><ul><li>Bug Fixes  <ul><li>Fixed an issue preventing the JAK Burnout Kit from being equipped to the Holger 26 Light Machine Gun.</li></ul></li></ul><h3>Maps</h3><ul><li>G3T_H1GH  <ul><li>Fixed an issue preventing the Mosquito Drone from targetting enemy players.</li></ul></li></ul><h3>Modes</h3><ul><li>COD Warrior  <ul><li>Fixed an issue causing players to die immediately in the Revive!

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-mrbeast-reality-show-allegations-shouldn%E2%80%99t-be-a-surprise.946092/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/mrbeast-beast-games<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Jimmy “MrBeast” Donaldson is in the news lately, following a report from <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/02/style/mrbeast-beast-games-competition-show.html?unlocked_article_code=1._00.Akz3.WPAO-uB2vIIt&amp;smid=url-share" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The New York Times</a> alleging negative treatment of participants in his upcoming Amazon competition show. This comes on the heels of some other recent <a href="https://kotaku.com/mrbeast-slur-n-word-clip-2017-controversy-explained-1851612313" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">controversy</a>, and, taken together, it’s tempting to see all this as a sign that the MrBeast empire is–maybe at last, depending on your opinions of him–crumbling. But, really, none of this is anything new; instead, it’s the system in which MrBeast operates working as intended.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>According to The Times, contestants on MrBeast’s in-development reality competition show, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/3/18/24104976/amazon-mrbeast-prime-video-beast-games" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Beast Games</em></a>, experienced mistreatment including lack of access to medicine, hygiene supplies, and food (the Times notes that “on a few occasions, the production staff passed around small Feastables chocolate bars, a brand created by Mr. Donaldson, and filmed some people eating and praising the candy.”) Participants also said they experienced sleep deprivation and injuries. In one very reality TV moment, a “bruised and bleeding” contestant who was eliminated claimed she</p><blockquote><p>was handed $1,000 in a stack of dollar bills as a consolation prize but said she had to hand the money back to producers after the cameras were off. Competitors were told they would receive their real payments later, she said, but as of publication time, she had not yet been paid.</p><p>Several contestants told The Times they had since been contacted by the production team and offered an additional $1,000.</p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p>Part of the problem seemed to stem from the fact that while participants believed there would only be 1,000 competitors, there were 2,000 in this first round, which will air on MrBeast’s YouTube channel before the second round airs on Amazon. MrBeast has blamed the conditions in part on “the <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cp4wnrxqlewo" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CrowdStrike incident</a>, extreme weather and other unexpected logistical and communications issues.”</p><p>But these kinds of conditions are endemic to reality TV. In recent years, multiple <em>Love is Blind </em><a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/tv/2024/01/04/renee-poche-love-is-blind-netflix-lawsuit/72101776007/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">contestants</a> have <a href="https://x.com/MorePerfectUS/status/1687169404935753733" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sued</a> Netflix over their treatment on the show. Cast members of the <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2023/10/real-housewives-bravo-reckoning" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Real Housewives</em> series</a> have spoken up about their negative experiences. Contestants on <a href="https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2020/07/9786277/is-survivor-show-sexist-women-tv-contestants" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Survivor</em></a> experienced discrimination from other cast members. Netflix’s <em>Squid Game: The Challenge</em> reality show–which draws fundamentally misguided inspiration from Netflix’s scripted <em>Squid Game</em>, which also feels like it inspired <em>Beast Games </em>and, obviously, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0e3GPea1Tyg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">MrBeast’s <em>Squid Game</em> recreation show</a>–saw contestants allege <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/tv-movies/tv-movie-features/netflix-squid-game-reality-show-cruel-rigged-inhumane-contestants-say-1234672474/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">similar mistreatment</a> to <em>Beast Games</em> participants.</p><p>A contestant on <em>Squid Game: The Challenge </em>told Rolling Stone, “It was the incompetencies of scale — they bit off more than they could chew.” This sounds similar to what some <em>Beast Games</em> participants who spoke to The Times said of their experiences, with The Times writing that contestants found that the staff members were “often not helpful and appeared disorganized… Contestants felt that the staff was overwhelmed by the volume of competitors.” This is also tragically par for the course in reality TV: staffers across shows have spoken up about <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/business-news/reality-tv-workers-unionize-industry-organize-1235746974/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">overtime, low pay</a>, and other negative working conditions. While there’s no excuse if staffers failed in their duty of care to participants, staff and participants alike are caught in the ugly system of reality TV.</p><div><figure><div><blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>NEW: Reality TV producers are pulling back the curtain on your favorite shows.</p><p>From World of Dance to American Idol, producers put in 18-hour days with no overtime pay.

These kinds of shows have been vectors to stardom both for rich people like the Kardashians and everyday folks who win competitions like <em>American Idol</em>. But even if they don’t feature actors saying scripted lines, most of us know they aren’t actual reflections of reality. They’re <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/wxnygn/theres-100-manipulation-the-inner-workings-of-reality-tv-according-to-a-producer" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">framed and edited</a> to heighten the drama and try to carve out narratives. And competition shows like <em>The Voice, So You Think You Can Dance</em>, and their grittier counterparts like <em>Fear Factor</em>, <em>Squid Game: The Challenge</em>, and MrBeast’s <em>Beast Games</em> tell a grim story of how a person finds success these days: either by getting lucky enough to be picked out of a crowd, or putting away all the narrative artifice and simply risking your safety for money.</p><p>MrBeast is the current golden boy of a growing version of reality TV, one that doesn’t take place on TV at all. He’s famous for his acts of <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/radio/tapestry/mr-beast-charity-controversy-1.6846810" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">largesse</a>, giving money to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_GMakKf7G4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">homeless people</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TJ2ifmkGGus" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">funding surgeries</a>. But he’s not alone: Dramatic <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-0lrgoeXiw" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">acts of charity</a> and “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n1ldfGf-FNE" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pranking it forward</a>” are all over our feeds these days. If I click through more than a couple YouTube Shorts or Facebook Reels, I get mired in an inescapable flood of this kind of stuff, all carefully edited to highlight the gratitude of recipients. On the one hand, videos like these stand in contrast to the nastier stuff on YouTube; as content creator Josh Liljenquist, who films himself buying huge amounts of food for the homeless from local businesses, told <a href="https://www.startribune.com/minnesota-tiktok-food-unhoused-homeless-social-media-clout-charity-altruism-facebook-instagram-viral/600336333" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Minnesota’s Star Tribune</a> about why he started doing his videos,</p><blockquote><p>I was scrolling through a few days ago, and some person was doing public content. He goes behind somebody and just sucker punches him in the back of the head. ... That's the type of stuff that kids are looking at… Would you rather have that, inspiring kids to do that? Or by doing good by feeding homeless people?</p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p>On the one hand, it’s hard to argue with Liljenquist’s logic. If these videos help people while also making acts of charity or kindness appealing, or put copycat ideas in young people’s heads, that’s not a <em>bad</em> thing necessarily. But as <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/charity-tiktok-videos-put-an-uncomfortable-spin-on-morality/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wired</a> wrote in 2022, thanks to altruism stunts on platforms like YouTube and TikTok,&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>We are now so used to viewing the world through our screens that many of us forget to question the fact that a camera is rolling at all… Should vulnerable people have to perform for viewers before they’re deemed worthy of help?</p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p>People have <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/health-wellness/2023/02/01/mrbeast-cures-blind-people-video-why-its-receiving-backlash/11161719002/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">criticized MrBeast before </a>over these <a href="https://www.cbc.ca/radio/tapestry/mr-beast-charity-controversy-1.6846810" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">questions</a>. Plus, if he’s really motivated by doing good, why film it? But at the same time, he wouldn’t be able to do any of this without the money he’s making<em> from</em> filming it. MrBeast’s brand is a unique combination of the illusory down-to-earth parasociality of YouTube and the good vibes of his stunt-based altruism. As Patricia Hernandez described him at <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24093399/end-of-mrbeast-youtube-era" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Polygon</a>, “His branding is at once self-aggrandizing yet selfless,” doing things for others that are primarily about how <em>he</em> is doing them. This has made him the head of a <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2024/02/15/mrbeast-brings-in-700-million-a-yearheres-why-he-says-hes-not-rich.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">financially lucrative</a> empire and one of the major employers of his <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2023/11/03/mr-beast-money-hometown-greenville-creator-economy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hometown</a>.</p><p>But there’s nothing unusual about what he does, both in the world of reality TV and the world of content creation on the internet. And, depressingly, there’s nothing unusual about the dark reality behind these veneers, either. When watching MrBeast and creators like him, it’s easy to be either too cynical or too credulous. But all of this–from the fame he generates to the uncomfortable position recipients of his generosity find themselves in to the chaos behind the scenes–are just an entertainment engine spinning the way it's always spun, and doing just what it's designed to: capture our attention and funnel money to the top, be that TV executives or the MrBeast empire.</p><p>The accusations at <em>Beast Games</em> further bring to light the realities behind competition shows, which badly need an overhaul for the sake of staff and participants alike. And taking some of the shine off MrBeast could serve to put him in context: less a feel-good exemplar of humanity and more, at best, a bandaid on bigger systemic problems like lack of access to medical care, housing, and food. People shouldn’t have to hope to be picked out of the crowd by YouTubers or reality show producers for help. What MrBeast and other creators like him do isn’t some new, feel-good frontier; it’s a symptom of how much our systems have failed us. Even the example of MrBeast’s success reminds me of nothing so much as how bleak the job market is, where maybe it’s better to try to make a living selling pieces of your life and the lives of others on the internet (itself a<a href="https://aftermath.site/pokimane-matpat-retiring-youtube-twitch" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> harmful grind</a>) than trying to make a decent living by simply <a href="https://endhomelessness.org/blog/illustrating-the-limits-of-homeless-sector-wages-employees-likely-struggle-to-pay-the-rent/#:~:text=A%202021%20study%20by%20Dennis,temporary%20housing%20programs%20was%20%2430%2C189.&amp;text=This%20means%20that%20many%20in,in%20or%20close%20to%20poverty." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">working in helping professions</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>The grim realities undergirding reality TV is something the original <em>Squid Game </em>explored very well, which is of course why companies like Netflix and Amazon, who benefit from it, completely miss the point in their versions. If the artifice around reality TV has to crack, it should do so around one of its most famous examples. The sooner we see all of this for what it is, and the sooner we do away with it, the better.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/06/star-wars-jedi-survivor-last-gen-port-hits-ps4-and-xbox-one-in-september/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>EA and Respawn have announced that <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/star-wars-jedi-survivor">Star Wars Jedi: Survivor</a> is coming to PlayStation 4 and Xbox One on 17th September. The last-gen version will come in at a $49.99 retail price, and still have an upgrade path from last-gen to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/playstation-5">PS5</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/xbox-series-x">Xbox Series X|S</a>.</p>
<p>Anyone who pre-orders on PS4 or Xbox One before 17th September will get a free cosmetic item set themed after Obi-Wan Kenobi.</p>


<p>In the run up to this new release, Respawn will also be releasing a patch for the PC version of Star Wars Jedi: Survivor in the coming weeks, which promises “enhancements to the game’s technical performance, controls and more, plus a variety of quality-of-life improvements.”</p>
<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/08/02/star-wars-jedi-survivor-is-being-ported-back-to-ps4-and-xbox-one/">The port was announced almost exactly a year ago</a>, with EA CEO Andrew Wilson confirming that the game was being ported back to the last generation. “Thanks to the strength of this legendary franchise and community demand, our development team has committed to bringing this Jedi experience to PlayStation 4 and Xbox One,” he said at the time.</p>
<p>That still left plenty of work for Respawn to do, taking everything that the game is able to do on PS5 and Xbox Series X|S, using the speedy SSDs for loading and newer versions of Unreal Engine, and making it work with a much lesser CPU and a slower hard drive.</p>

<p>If the port holds up, then this is a great follow up to Respawn’s original Star Wars tale. In our <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/04/26/star-wars-jedi-survivor-review/">Star Wars Jedi: Survivor review</a>, Aran said, “Star Wars Jedi: Survivor is a great continuation of Cal Kestis’ journey. The story is a little predictable and platforming could be sharper, but this is a sequel that builds on the ideas of the original and there’s real enjoyment to be had in exploring the expansive new worlds, digging into the lore and running into secret boss fights.”</p>

            <p>In the grim darkness of the far future, there is only War, unless you don't have a 64-bit PC with an Intel Core i5-8600K equivalent and at least eight gigs of RAM, in which case you'll have to, I don't know, live in everlasting peace, or something. I'm pretty sure not having eight gigs of RAM is heretical, but never fear, you can probably compensate by taking a leaf from the God-Emperor's book and arrange for a host of dying psykers to pour their brain energy into your motherboard.</p>
<p>All of which is to say that Focus Home have released the system requirements for huge-shouldered action game <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2">Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2</a>.

<p>To my non-hardware-editor eye, these don’t seem that terrifying, but bear in mind that these are the requirements for running the game at 1080p. I suspect higher resolutions on Ultra are going to take a toll. Best round up a few extra psykers, just to be safe.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/i-blinked-and-almost-missed-warhammer-40k-spare-marine-2s-release-date">Space Marine 2 will release on September 9th</a>, and I think it's fair to say we're looking forward to it. To lapse into the accursed lingo of scoring, the 2011 original felt like a 7/10 action game with a 9/10 action game trapped inside it, revving a chainsword. The sequel features <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/space-marine-2-shows-off-10-minutes-of-stomping-chainswording-and-a-chaos-tease-for-the-warhammer-40k-sequel-in-extended-gameplay">a new campaign starring Ultramarine stalwart Lieutenant Titus</a> plus a squishy rogue's gallery of greenskins, Tyranids and Chaos Marines. It also boasts co-op and competitive <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/it-looks-like-space-marine-2-will-let-you-go-head-to-head-in-pvp-multiplayer">multiplayer</a>, though sadly it doesn't look like there will be any interspecies PvP.</p>
<p>This latter omission is, of course, a test of your loyalty to the Imperium, the most important "system requirement" of all. A true servant of the God-Emperor would not blanch at being unable to play a Tyranid. Speaking of traitors, a WIP but apparently complete and fully playable version of the game <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/at-least-500-people-will-trounce-you-in-space-marine-2s-multiplayer-at-launch-because-theyre-already-playing-a-torrent-of-the-entire-game">leaked online last month</a>. I dare say there's footage in the wilds if you fancy spoiling it for yourself.</p>

The changes don’t deal with the flamethrower directly, but rather with its flame effects and how those are handled by the game’s systems. Here’s how they read:</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Adjusted flame effects to work more realistically.</li><li>It doesn’t go through various bodies/objects where bounce off would be the expected behavior, like on armors and static objects.</li></ul></blockquote><p>It’s a seemingly innocent fix that has turned lots of players into bug food. Earlier this year, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1b7x5pl/flamethrower_can_kill_chargers_quite_fast_now/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1b7x5pl/flamethrower_can_kill_chargers_quite_fast_now/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">players discovered the flamethrower was basically Charger-bane</a></span> for the <em>Helldivers 2</em> enemies that otherwise deflected bullets with ease. While it wasn’t meta breaking, it made the situational tool a lot more useful than it otherwise would have been. After today’s changes, the flames no longer appear to be able to reach the soft underbellies of the Chargers, or easily ignite burn damage on other weak spots. </p><p>It’s also just not as fun to use. “Flamethrower can’t kill chargers now,” <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1eldw49/they_nerfed_the_flamethrower/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1eldw49/they_nerfed_the_flamethrower/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote</a></span> one player on the subreddit. “Doesn’t go through their leg armor anymore. It also feels like crap to use, weirdly high recoil.” Another was more succinct. “I love when they take my favorite weapon and make it useless,” they wrote.</p><figure id="" data-id="24c8cf9d48f0fcaf55504b7efefe554c" data-recommend-id="image://24c8cf9d48f0fcaf55504b7efefe554c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1081" data-height="771" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot shows players complaining on the Helldivers Reddit.

It’s possible that these under-the-hood changes to flame effects are just part of developer Arrowhead Studios trying to make everything is working as intended when the new guns drop. But plenty of players feel like <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1ele6iu/freedom_flame_releases_this_weeklets_nerf_the/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1ele6iu/freedom_flame_releases_this_weeklets_nerf_the/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">it’s an underhanded way</a></span> of potentially pushing them to pay for the new battle passes now that their existing flamethrowers have been nerfed.<br></p><p>Changes like these have long been a sore spot in <em>Helldivers 2</em>, however. While Arrowhead has re-balanced the game at various points to try and keep it challenging and make players explore alternate ways of playing, it can also feel like the studio is just constantly taking away fans’ favorite toys. Players discover a weapon is really good at a thing, they use it religiously for months, it becomes a corner stone of the community culture, and then it gets killed in a new update. For some that keeps the game evolving, but for others it’s a reason to take a break. </p><p>“I’m Level 140, played since launch. I had it with the nerfs man. At least make it make sense!” <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1elg8gq/im_done/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1elg8gq/im_done/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote</a></span> one particularly demoralized fan. “I thought the people complaining were crazy, but I was here a long time and I see the patterns now: Nerf a weapon, forcing everyone to the new meta. AH sees the meta, nerf it, make the enemy ridiculously 10 times stronger.”</p><p>Not everyone is against the nerf. Some players have already discovered new ways to use the flamethrower that still make it an effective bug-killing machine, but it requires much better positioning and execution. One theory is that the new behavior will more closely mimic the way the new fire-based weapons act, keeping them all in line with one another. Still, it’s easy to see why players who have been casually enjoying the game as it is are getting burnt out on the constant whiplash of weapon balancing. We’ll have to wait until the new Warbond drops later this week to see how it all shakes out. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Getting ready to film your next YouTube or TikTok video, but want to find the best and most optimal settings for recording in OBS? While the quality of your video can largely depend on the PC you are filming on, there are still settings in OBS for recording that most would consider the best.</p>



<p>Here are the best OBS settings for recording.</p>



<h2 id="h-best-obs-recording-format">Best OBS Recording Format </h2>



<p>Luckily, recording on OBS is quite simple. Though, there are a few settings you may want to tweak before hitting the record button.</p>



<p>To find your recording settings, simply click Output in the General Settings tab. This will give you options for recording and live streaming. Obviously, we want to focus on recording.</p>







<h3>Best OBS Recording Settings:</h3>



<ul>
<li>1920×1080 (For YouTube)</li>



<li>1080×1920 (For TikTok and Shorts)</li>



<li>Bitrate between 3,000 and 4,000</li>



<li>Select x264</li>
</ul>



<figure></figure>



<h3 id="h-best-obs-video-settings">Best OBS Video Settings:</h3>

<li>1080×1920 (For TikTok and Shorts)</li>



<li>Downscale Filter: Lanczos</li>



<li>Frame Rate: 60 FPS</li>
</ul>



<p>These settings can be tweaked depending on your computer. If you have two GPUs, then recording on one of those instead of <strong>x264</strong> is okay.</p>



<p>These OBS settings are the best for recording for YouTube, helping give your viewers a smooth and high-quality viewing experience.</p>







<h2>Best OBS Settings For Recording Low-End PC</h2>



<p>For those who have a low-end PC, there are better settings to help optimize your recording. The last thing you want is for your video to come out all laggy and whatnot. </p>

<li>720×1280 (For TikTok and Shorts)</li>

            <title><![CDATA[EXCLUSIVE: EA, NFL Negotiating License Extension For Madden NFL]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/ea-nfl-negotiating-license-extension-for-madden/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/exclusive-ea-nfl-negotiating-license-extension-for-madden-nfl.946047/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/ea-nfl-negotiating-license-extension-for-madden/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>For nearly 20 years, when it comes to simulation football games, there is only one option: EA Sports and Madden NFL. EA has had an exclusive license agreement with the NFL since December 2004, making the Madden franchise the sole game in town. Sure, there have been other football games since then, but nothing like what was around in the early 2000s when fans had games like NFL Fever and NFL 2K as alternatives to Madden. But now, as the exclusive contract between EA and the NFL gets close to the end of the current agreement, many have been wondering whether that’s about to change.</p>



<p>The current deal was signed as an <a href="https://x.com/AlbertBreer/status/1266072611253035011" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">extension back in 2020</a> for $1.5 billion, and it goes through the 2025 season. There is an option to extend it by a year through 2026 if target revenue was hit, and, by all estimations, that target has been. So what we’re looking at is a contract that expires in two years.</p>



<p>That two year window is the same point in time when EA and the NFL announced their last extension of the Madden license. So, where is the current one?</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="EXCLUSIVE: EA, NFL Negotiating License Extension For Madden NFL" width="1200" height="675" src="about:blank" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/sdZ6FDhf1cQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<h2 id="h-talks-are-ongoing">Talks Are Ongoing</h2>



<p>Sources have indicated to Insider Gaming that discussions between EA and the NFL have been on-going regarding the future of the game and the license. It’s said that talks began later than in the past for a variety of reasons, including concern from the league if remaining exclusive with one company was the best option.</p>



<p>The league has been well aware of the public reception to the franchise the past few years. And one thing they don’t like is when the shield is viewed in any sort of negative light. That meant there was added pressure from not only within EA to deliver but from the NFL as well.</p>



<p>After the issues that plagued Madden 23, last year’s Madden 24 was viewed as a make-or-break game from all aspects. Internally, it wasn’t going to just come down to how much money the game made in initial sales, but how well it did in retaining players throughout the year.</p>



<p>The game ultimately “exceeded all expectations” in terms of both revenue and player base. Through July 2024, 11 months after the game’s release, Madden 24 remained a top 10 game on both Xbox and PlayStation in weekly average users (WAU). While Madden Ultimate Team is a big reason for that, the internal belief is that if the game “wasn’t good at all” people would’ve left by then. Sources went as far to say that Madden 24 was felt by many as a “turning point” for the franchise with a “feeling that Madden 25 will kickstart things in a bigger way”.</p>



<figure></figure>



<h2 id="h-how-confident-is-ea">How Confident Is EA?</h2>



<p>Going back to the contract discussions, many who spoke on the condition of anonymity due to the nature of the subject say that they believe an agreement on a new contract will come within the next 12-18 months.</p>



<p>“We have no reason to believe we won’t still have the exclusive license,” said one source.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Another said, “At the end of the day, Madden is making more and more money each year for both EA and the NFL. The sales continue to go up, and it would be crazy to not have the deal continue.”</p>



<p>Of course, there is the idea that Madden’s numbers are only what they are because of the exclusive license. Fans who want to play as their favorite NFL team or player really have no other choice if they want a realistic game.</p>



<p>“That’s just the way it is right now. What do they want us to say?” one person with EA said, adding that they don’t mean anything negative by it.</p>



<p>Every source who spoke was adamant, though, that the developers care about what the players want. They aren’t just trying to get by with each game. They are actively doing what they can in the time they have between releases.</p>



<p>“We honestly do want players to love the game each year,” one said. “We know we aren’t going to make everyone happy, but our goal with each game is to make it better than the last and have more people enjoy it than the year before. People can believe what they want, but we really do care about the game we are putting out there.”</p>



<p>As far as the possibility of losing the exclusive rights to allow more simulation games from competitors, I was told, “It’s not impossible, but there’s honestly no way someone else could compete with us for the rest of this generation and possibly into the next one due to the timing of the deal and how long it takes to make a game like this.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“We’re not worried.”</p>



<p>Neither EA nor the NFL returned multiple requests for official comment on the state of the agreement and negotiations.</p>

One of the latest leaks shows a potential new Warzone map, which is already creating some controversy due to the design.</p><p dir="ltr">As <a href="https://x.com/charlieINTEL/status/1819837521133760767" rel="nofollow ">originally reported by CharlieIntel</a>, the leaked footage shows an island setting for a large-scale battle-royale map called Avalon. The video reveals that the map consists of a series of small islands. The islands are connected by bridges, but there is plenty of surrounding water that could potentially lead to a lot of swimming and water fights.</p>

<p dir="ltr">The video clip from CharlieIntel has been removed by a copyright strike, but the same video shared by <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CODWarzone/comments/1ejdt0c/new_potential_warzone_map_leaked_as_part_of_major/" rel="nofollow ">JenNettles</a> remains on Reddit, where players are already chiming in on their thoughts of the map design. SideOfFish comments saying, "Caldera, but with water. SMH." Another Redditor replies saying, "I already find it frustrating to cross rivers in Urzikstan, and this looks far worse."</p><p dir="ltr">The inclusion of water in Warzone can often lead to frustrating fights and final circles, with players struggling with visibility and underwater shooting. Comparisons to Caldera are also potentially negative, as the WWII-themed island map designed for Call of Duty: Vanguard was Warzone's least-popular battle-royale map.</p><p dir="ltr">It was also reported by <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/warzone-new-map-avalon-leaks/" rel="nofollow ">Inside Gaming</a> that Avalon is suggested to be the Warzone map for 2025, following the reintroduction of Warzone's popular Verdansk map. Another recent Black Ops 6 leak includes a graphic look at the ability for players to use their <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-leaks-continue-this-time-with-a-graphic-new-ability/1100-6525547/">enemies as a meat shield</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">An official Warzone map reveal is likely to happen during Activision's Call of Duty: Next event on August 28. Black Ops 6 releases on October 25 across PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, and PC.</p>

					<p>Despite Deck13's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/atlas-fallen-god-of-sand/">Atlas Fallen</a> showing much promise before release, the German studio's game failed to deliver a truly compelling experience. On paper, the mix of the combat mechanics of the Monster Hunter series and character action games like Devil May Cry and Bayonetta sounded exciting, but a clunky execution of these concepts made the experience very middling despite a well-designed world with deep lore.</p>
<p>Not wanting to leave their game in a state that the studio itself did not find optimal, Deck13 has launched the Reign of Sand free <a href="https://wccftech.com/atlas-fallen-gets-enhanced-with-free-reign-of-sand-update-on-august-6/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">update</a>, which attempts to fix many of the base game's issues to present an experience that is not worthy of players's time. Does it succeed? Yes and no at the same time. While the enhancements are substantial, they go on to improve features that were already good enough to begin with, not addressing those core issues that impact the experience the most, namely the combat mechanics.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Atlas-Fallen-Reign-of-Sand-01.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>The Reign of Sand update doesn't introduce any major change to the Atlas Fallen story, as the studio opted to lightly expand it with new lore elements. So, once again, players will control a fated Unnamed who obtained the Gauntlet, an ancient and powerful artifact that grants them the power to banish the Wraith who have been plaguing the world that was once almost destroyed by the Sun God Thelos and covered in sand. With the mysterious Nyaal at their side, the Unnamed will get to meet all sorts of people on their journey, letting them learn more about the world they live in and the battle they are fighting.</p>
<p>While the update doesn't shake up the story a whole lot, Reign of Sand does bring some improvements that influence the narrative. For starters, the beginning of the game has been tweaked a bit to get the player faster into the actual adventure, which is a very welcome change, given how the first few minutes were probably the dullest part of the campaign. The biggest change, however, is in regard to voice acting. The original male voice for the Unnamed was replaced with much higher quality acting provided by Ben Starr, who rose to fame in the video gaming world by voicing Clive Rosfield, the main character of <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/final-fantasy-xvi-the-planets-dyin-clive/">Final Fantasy XVI</a>. Needless to say, the difference between the old and new voice acting is night and day, presenting dialogues in a more polished way and improving the experience considerably.</p>
<p>In a similar way, the Atlas Fallen gameplay saw mostly an expansion and some tweaking with the Reign of Sand update. The update adds a revamped progression system that makes it easier to enhance the Unnamed, new abilities, and new Essence Stones that grant players even more customization options. Having not played again after having reviewed it last year, I can't tell for sure, but I feel the game's balance has been tweaked as well, and I had far fewer issues achieving high Momentum, unlocking the ultimate form of the main weapons and unleashing the most powerful abilities, in the new version of the game. While these tweaks and quality-of-life improvements are very welcome and make the game slightly more enjoyable than at launch, they fail to address the core issues with the game's combat, which is still clunky and floaty.</p>
<p>The camera, at the very least, has been improved slightly, so it is a little easier to spot and avoid off-screen attacks, but blocking using the Sandskin ability or dodging attacks still doesn't feel as responsive or satisfying as it should have. Again, I find these issues weird for a studio like Deck13, which proved in the past with The Surge series it is more than capable of crafting weighty, satisfying combat. So, if you expect the combat to reach the heights of other games with the update, you will still be disappointed.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/Atlas-Fallen-Reign-of-Sand-02.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Rounding up the additions brought to Atlas Fallen by the Reign of Sand update are additional challenges. The long-awaited New Game + comes with Nightmare Mode, putting player skills and builds to the test, while those still in the middle of the adventure will find new combat challenges like the Source and Watcher's Challenges, which task players with defeating enemies under certain conditions, also giving them the chance to take control of Nyaal and use some brand new abilities. Again, welcome additions, especially considering similar content is usually added via paid DLC but hardly game-changing.</p>
<p>Deck13's commitment to improving Atlas Fallen is commendable, and, for the most part, the Reign of Sand update achieves what it sets out to do, enhancing the game enough to make it a little more worthwhile to players who might have skipped it at launch. Still, the update doesn't address what are, in my opinion, the game's biggest issues, so those who didn't like how the combat felt last year will not change their opinions with the game's updated version.</p>

<p>With welcome improvements, quality of life changes, and new content, Atlas Fallen: Reign of Sand enhances the game developed by Deck13. However, the update mainly improves the game's existing strengths and fails to address the core issues with its combat system. As a result, the update delivers only partial improvements, leaving those dissatisfied with the game's floaty and unsatisfying combat still wanting more.</p>

Soon enough you get access to a giant drill , the Grinder — wow, that’s the other half of the title. The Grinder allows you to drill into different surfaces in each level, offering a unique movement mechanic that everything else in <em>Pepper Grinder</em> is built around. While moving through ground with the Grinder you feel like you are shooting through water, and you can pull off thrilling moves like jettisoning yourself out of the ground to make big leaps. When you pick up the basics of movement and get into the rhythm, stringing together jumps and drilling into the ground to pick up speed and rush through levels is an exhilarating feeling that never gets old. At its best times <em>Pepper Grinder</em>’s flow-state movement mechanics evoke the very best platformers.</p><p>The only place <em>Pepper Grinder</em> really puts the brakes on its fun movement-based adventure comes when combat becomes a heavier focus. There are boss fights sprinkled in and your average grunt enemy to take down across stages but combat isn’t nearly as thought out or satisfying as speeding through levels. However, the best additions to <em>Pepper Grinder</em> come in its later stages, where the levels amp up just enough to keep offering a new challenge. Once you get into the game’s excellent movement you’ll find yourself rushing through levels as fast as possible until suddenly the game is over.</p><hr><p><em>Pepper Grinder</em> is now available on PlayStation, Xbox, Nintendo Switch, and PC.</p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
