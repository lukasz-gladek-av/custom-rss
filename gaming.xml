            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>For years, PlayStation fans have begged for a remake of<em> Bloodborne</em>. <a href="https://kotaku.com/bluepoint-sony-playstation-ps5-god-war-2000671390">Bluepoint Games</a>, the PlayStation studio behind the excellently received <em>Demon’s Souls</em> remake, seemed like the obvious candidate. <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2026-02-27/sony-s-bluepoint-pitched-bloodborne-remake-before-closure?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc3MjIyMjY3OSwiZXhwIjoxNzcyODI3NDc5LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJUQjRWUTJLR0NURlowMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.s6maZIveh-F152mZBWUNjPFeE0Lm7AFRegwaizQvVlA">According to <em>Bloomberg</em></a>, the first-party team actually did pitch a <em>Bloodborne</em> remake not too long ago, but FromSoftware rejected the idea.</p> <p>In fact, many at Bluepoint had assumed for a long time <a href="https://kotaku.com/bloodborne-remake-bluepoint-demons-souls-ps5-sony-playstation-2000671988">that a <em>Bloodborne</em> remake was inevitable</a>. Then in 2025, after its <em>God of War</em> multiplayer project was cancelled, Bloomberg reports that the idea of the studio fielding such a remake was formally pitched within Sony. Unfortunately, FromSoftware wasn’t onboard. While Bluepoint scrambled to come up with other ideas, including a potential <em>Ghost of Tsushima</em> spin-off, Sony never greenlit any of the other pitches.</p>

 <p><em>Bloomberg</em> doesn’t report exactly why FromSoftware rejected the pitch. The only real theory for why is one offered by former PlayStation Worldwide Studios executive Shuhei Yoshida <a href="https://kotaku.com/bloodborne-2-remake-remaster-miyazaki-sequel-1851741356">in an interview last year</a>. “I have only my personal theory to that situation,” he said in 2025. “I left first-party Sony so I don’t know what’s going on, but my theory is— because I remember Miyazaki really, really loved<em>&nbsp;Bloodborne</em>, what he created—and so I think he is interested, but he’s so successful and he’s so busy so he cannot do it himself, but he doesn’t want anyone else to touch it. So that’s my theory, and the PlayStation team respects his wish.”</p> <p>All of this suggests that a <em>Bloodborne</em> remake by FromSoftware itself could still happen at some point in the future, but that possibility is little consolation for fans who don’t want to see one of the last console generation’s best games locked away exclusively on PS4. It’s also of no use to the folks at Bluepoint who might have had their studio saved if their remake pitch had actually come together.</p>

 <p>According to <em>Bloomberg</em>, the ultimate reason for the studio’s closure was a loss of faith among the higher-ups at Sony that Bluepoint could still deliver a high-quality original game as it has once been tasked with. <a href="https://kotaku.com/god-of-war-multiplayer-bluepoint-days-gone-2-concord-1851742012">The <em>God of War</em> live-service project</a> it had previously been working on would have reportedly featured Atreus navigating the underworld, but shift to co-op gameplay that never came together. Sony has moved forward with a remake of the original single-player trilogy, just without its best remake studio at the helm.</p>

<p>We've got at least a year until <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pokemon-winds-and-waves">Pokémon Winds &amp; Waves</a> comes to Switch 2's shores, but we're <em>already</em> thinking about the game's first big question — which starter will you pick? And, we've got to be honest, Generation 10 put a particularly tough choice in front of us.</p>
<p>We've met the tempting trio already — the Grass starter, Browt; the Fire starter Pombon, and the Water starter Gecqua — but let's get to know them a little bit more before we ask you lovely readers who your early favourite is.</p><div><figure data-videoid="RLc1VHm8D80" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytRLc1VHm8D80" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed43f22frntgzl&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>843k</span></a></p>

<h3>Browt, the Bean Chick Pokémon</h3>
<figure data-uuid="df38de21ad353"><a title="Browt Pokémon Winds &amp; Waves" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/df38de21ad353/browt-pokemon-winds-and-waves.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: The Pokémon Company</em></figcaption></figure>
<blockquote>
<p>"This Pokémon runs about energetically while photosynthesizing using the leaves on its brow. It’s lively, but it can also be a bit clumsy."</p>

<ul>
<li>Type: Grass</li>
<li>Height: 1′ (0.3 m)</li>
<li>Weight: 7.7 lbs. (3.5 kg)</li>
<li>Ability: Overgrow</li>
</ul>
<p>Well, look at this little fella! Our second Grass-type bird starter (following Rowlet from Sun &amp; Moon), Browt has a heck of a pair of eyebrows and some lovely lime green colouring.</p>
<p>They're smoll, they're round(-ish), and they have a big puffy tail. Very cute indeed.</p>
<h3>Pombon, the Puppy Pokémon</h3>
<figure data-uuid="d9b641678f771"><a title="Pombon Pokémon Winds &amp; Waves" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/d9b641678f771/pombon-pokemon-winds-and-waves.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: The Pokémon Company</em></figcaption></figure>

</ul>
<p>Oh goodness, dog lovers beware, we have the bestest boy (or girl) right here. Pombon is a pomeranian-inspired 'mon, fluffy and chipper just like the real pup.</p>
<p>We have a feeling this one'll be popular — just look at their face!</p>
<h3>Gecqua, the Water Gecko Pokémon</h3>
<figure data-uuid="fa9658d6bb8a6"><a title="Gecqua Pokémon Winds &amp; Waves" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/fa9658d6bb8a6/gecqua-pokemon-winds-and-waves.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: The Pokémon Company</em></figcaption></figure>

<p>Water and lizards go hand-in-hand, right? Gecqua is a sleek-looking 'mon (more excellent eyebrows, too) who looks right at home in this water-filled region.</p>
<p>Will they give Sobble a run for their money? Who can say at this point...</p>
<hr>
<p>That's pretty much everything we know about the three at this point, and they're the only <em>new</em> Pokémon we've seen too. So don't go building a whole new team in your head. Even if lots of returning Pocket Monsters have already been shown off.</p>
<p>For now, based on early impressions, we want to know who your favourite new Starter is. <em>Get voting in our poll below, and debate the best new beginner in the comments.</em></p>

			<p><strong>Fallout 76</strong>'s free <strong>Update 66</strong> goes live across all platforms in a few days, on Tuesday, <strong>March 3</strong>. Dubbed "<strong>The Backwoods</strong>", it aims to revitalize world events and activities while also introducing an iconic Cryptic enemy, the <strong>Bigfoot</strong>. Ahead of the release, a few folks from <strong>Bethesda Game Studios</strong> provided a remote presentation to press (Wccftech included) and answered several questions in a roundtable format about The Backwoods and the game as a whole.</p>

<h2 id="the-backwoods-update-overview">Fallout 76 "The Backwoods" Update Overview</h2>



<p>The most sweeping change in the upcoming update is arguably the <strong>fundamental redesign of how events and activities are categorized and balanced</strong>. <span>What were previously all called "events" have now been split into two distinct categories:&nbsp;<strong>Activities</strong>&nbsp;(designed for one to five </span>players, spawning every ten minutes with up to three or four, including an Enclave activity, happening simultaneously) and&nbsp;<strong>Public Events</strong>&nbsp;(designed for larger groups with greater rewards). In total, <strong>nearly 50 pieces of content were touched: around 25 activities and 25 public events</strong>. Key changes applied globally include tightened timers wherever events felt like they were dragging on for too long, improved reward tables ensuring every event and activity pulls from a global loot table with guaranteed caps and XP, guaranteed legendary enemies at every public event, enemy scaling up to level 125 to match higher-level players, and XP rewards that now scale dynamically with player level.</p>



<p>Two specific events were showcased live: <strong>Moonshine Jamboree</strong>, which received additional ranged enemies and floaters to counter the common tactic of camping rooftops, along with slightly tightened timers; and <strong>Most Wanted</strong>, which had its buckaroo requirement reduced from 600 to 500 and its timer count trimmed for a tighter feel.</p>



<p>Beyond events, the update includes a significant <strong>armor overhaul and rebalance</strong> aimed at making all armor sets viable rather than funneling players toward specific meta builds; <strong>improvements to the Pip-Boy</strong> making it significantly snappier and laying groundwork for future expansion of its functionality; an expansion of the <strong>You Might Map</strong> treasure hunt system, which now appears as possible rewards in activities and events; <strong>improved lockbox loot</strong> scaled to lock difficulty with legendary item chances; <strong>contextual ammo crates</strong> that drop ammo relevant to the weapon you're currently using; <strong>contextual seasonal item drops</strong> relevant to active weekly and daily challenges; <strong>Camp Titles</strong> (a new cosmetic system mirroring player titles but applied to camps, earnable through challenges, quests, and seasons); updates to <strong>one-star mod effects</strong>; new weapon mods and adjustments to armor and power armor mods; a new <strong>four-star Super Sledge</strong>; and <strong>vanity lights in photo mode</strong> for improved character photography.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/FO76_UninvitedGuests_Deathclaw-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>



<h2 id="new-party-crasher-system">The New Party Crasher System</h2>



<p>The update's headline new mechanic is the so-called <strong>Party Crasher system</strong>, which triggers at the conclusion of certain public events, giving an "<strong>uninvited guest enemy</strong>" a chance to spawn. Each public event has one specific thematically appropriate party crasher assigned to it, with one exception: <strong>Bigfoot</strong>, a new four-star legendary cryptid, who can appear across multiple events.</p>



<p><strong>Bigfoot is the centerpiece of the update and the first four-star enemy to appear outside of a raid</strong>. He carries a large club and throws exploding ticks, and comes with a five-minute kill timer, making it a DPS race before he retreats back into the forest. Killing him guarantees a four-star item drop, and he has an exclusive mod called the <strong>Thrillseeker mod</strong> that only he can drop. The spawn rate will be boosted for the first week post-launch, with a dedicated hourly events playlist specifically for Bigfoot, before settling to a lower default rate estimated at roughly once per hour of consistent event play. Bigfoot's footprints were also scattered across Appalachia as an environmental hint for eagle-eyed players, and a hidden secret tied to Bigfoot is discoverable only through the camera/photo mode. Standard three-star uninvited guests are weaker, have no time limit, and always drop two three-star items.</p>



<p>In the presentation, the team also showcased a <strong>Storm Goliath</strong>, which appeared as the uninvited guest at the Most Wanted event. Other confirmed party crashers are the Scorchbeast, the Deathclaw Matriarch, the Wendigo Colossus, and the Mirelurk Queen.</p>



<p>Here's the full transcript from the Q&amp;A portion. The questions were answered by Bethesda's Live Producer <strong>Keaton Bracy</strong>, Senior Systems Designer <strong>Kevin Wienecke</strong>, Senior Producer <strong>Bill LaCoste</strong>, and Creative Director <strong>Jon Rush</strong>. </p>

<h2 id="developer-qa">Developer Q&amp;A</h2>



<p><strong>What inspired the Party Crasher concept, and was it difficult to implement while staying true to Fallout 76's design?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Jon Rush:</strong> The inspiration was really about <strong>offering additional incentive to participate in public events</strong>. Party crashers only have a chance to spawn once the event concludes, so if you're a lower-level player and Bigfoot comes running at you after the event ends, you don't have to stick around. It's an added bonus, not a requirement. As for why Bigfoot specifically, Fallout 76 is steeped in cryptids, and we're in a forest setting, so <strong>it seemed like Bigfoot might have taken notice of what folks were doing in his forest and didn't appreciate the disturbance</strong>. It also felt like a fun, challenging way to offer players a different path to getting a four-star legendary outside of <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-76-is-finally-getting-a-proper-mmo-style-endgame-raid/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gleaming Depths</a>.</p>



<p><strong>Keaton Bracy:</strong> When we were choosing which creature to assign as each event's uninvited guest, we went through every event and asked what enemy would be thematically appropriate. You can't just throw a Deathclaw everywhere. Well, you could, but we wanted to make sure the uninvited guest fits the theme of the event it's tied to.</p>



<p><strong>Jon Rush:</strong> <strong>The initial idea for Bigfoot actually came from playing Campfire Tales at night, finishing the event, and thinking how cool it would be if Bigfoot just appeared and smashed your face in</strong>. That's where the original thought came from.</p>



<p><strong>What is the spawn rate for Party Crashers?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Jon Rush:</strong> We're not going to pin down the exact number; the data miners already know it anyway. For the initial launch period, spawn rates will be slightly elevated to add to the excitement of the new content. Once the default rates kick in, it's on the lower end, but <strong>you should see roughly at least one per hour if you keep attending events consistently</strong>.</p>



<p><strong>Keaton Bracy:</strong> For the first week specifically, we'll be running an hourly events playlist for Bigfoot, so he'll be showing up much more frequently during that window.</p>



<p><strong>Can Bigfoot appear at multiple events, or is each Party Crasher exclusive to one event?</strong></p>



<p><strong>John Rush:</strong> Bigfoot is the only uninvited guest who can appear across multiple events. <strong>Every other party crasher is specific to one event, chosen for thematic fit</strong>. We didn't want enemies showing up in events where they didn't make contextual sense, so every standard uninvited guest is tied to one specific event.</p>



<p><strong>Are four-star items guaranteed when defeating Bigfoot?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Jon Rush:</strong> Yes, <strong>four-star items are guaranteed when you kill Bigfoot. He has a reduced loot set compared to what you'd see in Gleaming Depths</strong>. It's not the full range, but he has one exclusive mod that only he can drop, called the Thrillseeker mod. That's a rarer drop from him, but it's a good one.</p>



<p><strong>Is there a quest associated with Bigfoot?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Jon Rush:</strong> There isn't, and that was a deliberate choice. We didn't want the overhead of a quest telling you to go kill Bigfoot, we wanted it to be a spontaneous thing. <strong>He just shows up and you think, "Oh my god, what is that?"</strong> We felt that it was better served without the quest UI framing around it. Sometimes he spawns. Watch out.</p>



<p><strong>What is the time limit to kill Bigfoot? Is this the same for all Party Crashers?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Jon Rush:</strong> Based on PTS feedback, <strong>we settled on a five-minute internal timer for Bigfoot</strong>. If you can't kill him in that window, he stomps off in a cloud of dust. That said, the standard three-star uninvited guests do not have a time limit. They're significantly weaker, so they're not really a problem, though one of them is actually pretty tough. They're a fun little surprise without the pressure of a timer.</p>



<p><strong>Will there be more ways to obtain four-star modules beyond Bigfoot, such as through bounty hunting or head hunts?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Jon Rush:</strong> That's a really good question, and <strong>we are in talks about expanding bounty hunting</strong>. One thing I've said in a few interviews is that when we designed the headhunt targets, we as developers thought they were genuinely hard, and then we released them and players demolished them instantly. Players always surprise us. <strong>We do want to make head hunts more challenging</strong>, and we have tentative plans down the road to expand that feature in a couple of directions that would increase both the challenge and the rewards. Stay tuned for more on that.</p>



<p><strong>How big are Bigfoot's feet in Fallout 76?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Jon Rush:</strong> He has two differently sized feet, as you might expect. One foot is approximately a size 62 and a half men's. His other foot is about a size 36. Makes shoe shopping really difficult.</p>



<p><strong>Are there female Bigfoots?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Jon Rush:</strong> Well, you had to come from somewhere. We may never know. Maybe that's for a future update.</p>



<p><strong>How did you determine which Fallout 76 events needed revisions?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Keaton Bracy:</strong> Our first goal was really to establish the separation between what we're now calling Activities and Public Events. Beyond that, we knew these were some of the older areas of the game that hadn't changed in years, while some of the newer public events were already in good shape. We wanted to go broad, touch everything and bring it all up to the current standard of the rest of the game. So <strong>we went through every single activity and every single public event and made sure they were all up to that bar</strong>.</p>



<p><strong>Will there be any changes coming for <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-76-ghoul-qa-the-game-is-thriving-and-we-have-no-plans-to-stop/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ghouls</a>?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Jon Rush:</strong> Future content takes ghouls into account much more. <strong>If you're playing as a ghoul, future content will feel meaningfully different</strong>. That's one way we're expanding on the ghoul experience. As for more specific additions like quests or perks, we do talk about those and we have some plans I can't disclose right now, but we definitely want to continue making the ghoul experience worthwhile and distinct from playing as a human.</p>



<p><strong>Given the positive community response to raids, are there plans to introduce new raids to Fallout 76 in the future?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Jon Rush:</strong> There are no plans I can speak to, but <strong>there are plans. You'll be hearing about that pretty soon</strong>. We're always looking for ways to introduce more challenges, and bigger challenges mean bigger rewards. <strong>We love raids, and we'll definitely be expanding on them</strong>.</p>



<p><strong>Are there more exciting things in Update 66 beyond what was shown?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Jon Rush:</strong> Yes, absolutely. The Pip-Boy performance improvements might not sound exciting, but once you use it, you'll really feel the difference: <strong>it's significantly snappier now, and it also gives us as developers more room to expand its utility in the future</strong>. We've also expanded the You Might Map treasure hunt system and added those as possible rewards across activities and events.</p>



<p><strong>Bill LaCoste:</strong> A lot of the lockboxes throughout the world have had their loot improved. Based on the difficulty of the lock, you now have a chance to get a legendary item. We've also added contextual seasonal item drops relevant to your active weekly and daily challenges, and contextual ammo crates that drop ammo matching whatever weapon you're currently using. And we have Camp Titles coming, similar to player titles but for your camp, earnable through challenges, quests, and seasons. <strong>There's also the big armor overhaul and rebalance, which is really about letting players play how they want without being forced into specific meta sets</strong>. A lot of the base stats are being normalized across armor types, so you can choose based on look and feel rather than being locked into one set for its numbers.</p>



<p><strong>Keaton Bracy:</strong> There are also a ton of updates to one-star mod effects, new weapon mods, adjustments to armor and power armor mods, and the new four-star Super Sledge. <strong>It's a really broad update that touches a lot of systems people engage with most regularly</strong>.</p>



<p><strong>Jon Rush:</strong> Oh, and vanity lights are coming to photo mode. <strong>When you enter photo mode there'll be a new lighting option that lets you really change how things appear when you're taking screenshots</strong>. And one more thing, there's a super secret tied to Bigfoot that's only revealed under a certain lens. That's all I'll say.</p>



<p><strong>Will more cryptids be coming to Fallout 76?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Jon Rush:</strong> I can't speak to that specifically, but maybe there will be. Most of us on this team love cryptids. They are fun to add and fun to blow up. <strong>There may be more</strong>. We'll see.</p>



<p><strong>Are there hidden lore elements or Easter eggs related to Bigfoot in the Backwoods?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Keaton Bracy:</strong> Use your camera. It'll be fine.</p>



<p><strong>Jon Rush:</strong> We also seeded Bigfoot's tracks across certain spots in Appalachia ahead of the update. Eagle-eyed players could have noticed them as a preview of where he may or may not appear. It was really fun watching players discover those.</p>



<p><strong>Will there be more fishing challenges or legendary fish added per season?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Kevin Wienecke:</strong> There are some fishing changes coming. I can't reveal too many details yet, but <strong>there will be new fish to chase, very good reasons to use cooking recipes with them, and completionists are going to like what I'm working on</strong>. Looking forward to sharing more on that.</p>



<p><strong>Will there be camp building updates in Update 66?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Jon Rush:</strong> Not specifically in this one. We think about updates in terms of identity; who are they for? Camp Revamp was very much for builders and changed everything about how building works. <strong>The Backwoods is more of an adventurer's update</strong>. That said, our player base is mostly a bit of both, so there's always something for everyone. But big structural changes to building? No, not in this patch.</p>



<p><strong>What was the most requested or challenging quality-of-life improvement to add in this Fallout 76 update?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Jon Rush:</strong> <strong>Probably the Pip-Boy work</strong>. It may not have been the most loudly requested thing, but it was very necessary. <strong>The difference is significant once you use it</strong>: you don't realize how much time you sink into just waiting for it to transition between tabs until it's gone. It's a lot snappier now, and it's one of those things you don't know you wanted until you have it.</p>

<p>Jelly Roll is playable in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/wwe-2k26/" id="3461">WWE 2K26.</a> The Grammy Award-winning country star is rated 80 overall. His rating was revealed as part of ESPN’s Ratings Reveal for the game.</p>



<p>Jelly Roll has been featured on WWE programming multiple times. At WWE SummerSlam 2025, he teamed with Randy Orton in a losing effort against Drew McIntyre and Logan Paul. Now, Roll can get his win back in the virtual squared circle for WWE 2K26.</p>



<figure></figure>







<h2 id="h-jelly-roll-isn-t-featured-on-wwe-2k26-s-soundtrack">Jelly Roll Isn’t Featured on WWE 2K26’s Soundtrack</h2>



<p>Earlier today, WWE Games revealed the full soundtrack for WWE 2K26. Jelly Roll is not featured on that soundtrack. Rather, this year’s tracks are heavy in the world of Rock. Linkin Park, Bad Omens, Turnstile, and Andrew WK got the nod instead. Check out the full soundtrack <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/wwe-2k26-soundtrack-revealed-linkin-park-bad-omens-more-featured/" id="181124">here</a>.</p>







<p>Contemporary music artists in WWE games are not a new phenomenon. All the way back in the year 2001, Fred Durst of Limp Bizkit was featured in two WWE games: WWF Raw on the original Xbox and WWF SmackDown!: Just Bring It on the PlayStation 2. Other celebrities who have made it into WWE games include Tyrese Haliburton, Pat McAfee, Mr. T, and more.</p>

              <p><span>Well, folks, it looks like </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-presents-winds-waves-pikachu-underwater-2000674398"><i><span>Pokémon Winds </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Waves</span></i></a> <span>may have finally broken the series’ bad graphics curse. At least, that’s what it looks like based on </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-winds-waves-trailer-breakdown-presents-pikachu-2000674465"><span>the first trailer</span></a><span>, which appears to be a marked visual improvement over </span><i><span>Scarlet </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Violet</span></i><span>, which have become </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-scarlet-violet-dlc-teal-mask-indigo-disk-gen-9-1851109325"><span>a poster child for the series’ poor technical performance</span></a><span>.</span></p> <p><i><span>Scarlet </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Violet</span></i><span>, released in 2022,</span> <span>were the last Switch-exclusive </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>games, and were heavily derided for not only being a buggy mess, but for looking like a GameCube tech demo. They had a big map that had no real texture or life to it. When they got a Switch 2 update, they ran at a buttery smooth 60 frames-per-second, but they still looked really rough and old. </span><i><span>Winds </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Waves</span></i><span>, meanwhile, have a notable technical and graphical leap, with much more dynamic lighting, shading, and water physics. The Pokémon themselves have a bit of texture to them similar to </span><i><span>Scarlet </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Violet</span></i><span>’s models, but beyond that, any direct comparisons we might make work in </span><i><span>Winds </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Waves</span></i><span>’</span> <span>favor. I’d still argue that it doesn’t look incredible by any stretch, but it definitely is the most dynamic-looking </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>game we’ve had in a while.</span></p>

<ul id="block-d0bea02d-4b9f-4991-b9db-3b35778ff3bf">
<li>Green letters are correct and in the right position.</li>



<li>Yellow letters are correct, but in the wrong position.</li>

</ul>

The game challenges players to guess a five-letter word in six tries or fewer, using hints from each attempt to narrow down the answer. Its straightforward concept, accessibility, and the thrill of solving a new puzzle each day helped it surge in popularity by late 2021. The success of Wordle inspired numerous spin-offs and social media challenges, leading to its acquisition by The New York Times in early 2022.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[This Video Of The McDonald’s CEO Struggling To Eat The New Big Arch Burger Is Cracking People Up]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/mcdonalds-ceo-big-arch-burger-instagram-2000674500</link>
            <guid>1448980</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>McDonald’s CEO and chairman Chris Kempczinski recently had to do the one part of the job I assume he dreads the most: Eat the food produced by his popular fast food chain. And it went about as well as you’d expect.</p> <p>I<a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DUTZ_ilDl41/">n a video originally posted on February 3 on Instagram</a>, Kempczinski recorded himself eating the new Big Arch Burger for lunch in his office. The video didn’t go super viral until people started sharing it on TikTok. And after watching it, I can see why so many people are fascinated by this short clip of a rich man eating a burger. But first the clip. Take it away, Chris K!</p>   <p>Where to start? First off, just a note from a human being who eats food, but perhaps you shouldn’t refer to your new hamburger as a “product.” It feels like a lawyer told him off-camera that, legally, it can’t be called food, so he should just call it a product. Once he’s done hyping it up, content creator Chris K opens it up and exclaims, “Holy cow.” Then, after looking over the burger, he looks at the camera with a flash of regret and says, “There’s so much going on with this.” You sound thrilled to eat it, buddy.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000674521" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000674521"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000674521">©McDonalds / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>The CEO of McDonald’s then takes what I can only describe as the smallest bite of a burger I’ve ever seen. It looks like a kid having to try some vegetable he doesn’t want to eat, but is forced by his mom to eat just a tiny bit. In the moment after eating it, you can tell he’s not happy about it, but he bravely soldiers on. He’ll ask for a bigger bonus during the next round of negotiations and will point to this video as a reason why. He claims this is his lunch. Readers, I’m doubtful that the burger got finished.</p>

 <p>And look, I love me some McDonald’s. I don’t care much for the chain’s burgers, but the rest of the menu is fine in a pinch. So don’t take this blog as me saying McDonald’s is awful. But it is funny to watch a very rich man forced to eat food that he’d never consume otherwise and then smile about it afterwards. Funny stuff. Thanks for the Friday giggles, Chris K!</p>

            <guid>1448962</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>It’s one of my favorite times of the year – when game developers come out like Santa’s elves and show off what they’ve been working on in their hidden little workshops. That’s right, it’s time for another Steam Next Fest, and for the February Steam Next Fest of 2026, there are over 3,500 demos for people to try.</p><p>With all those demos to try, no one can play them all. But to help you out I’ve spent the last few weeks trying a bunch of them, and I’m here to point out 10 of the demos you really should check out. Some of them are popular, some of them are obscure, and I’ve tried to capture a variety of genres here so that there’s something for everyone.</p><p>With all of that here are ten of the best and most interesting February 2026 Steam Next Fest Demos.</p><h3><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3265700/Vampire_Crawlers_The_Turbo_Wildcard_from_Vampire_Survivors/" rel="nofollow"><em>Vampire Crawlers</em></a></h3><p>There were two dungeon crawlers in this Next Fest that fought for space in this top 10, and <em>Vampire Crawlers </em>beat out the boomer shooter inspired <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4176460/Dungeons_of_DUSK/" rel="nofollow"><em>Dungeons of Dusk </em></a>by New Blood in a messy match. <em>Vampire Crawlers's </em>sheer energy and style plays near perfectly mixing dungeon crawlers, roguelite deckbuilding, and the <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/vampire-survivors" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="7938a993-0699-46f6-b76d-06acb4234348" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow"><em>Vampire Survivors </em></a>IP into a cascade of fun.</p><picture>

  </picture><p>It has some distinct and unique ideas that play differently in spots like the Crawler cards, and it feels really good to play. This was a demo I lost hours in, in a way that I never really have with <em>Vampire Survivors </em>itself.</p><h3><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3559900/Voidling_Bound_Demo/" rel="nofollow"><em>Voidling Bound</em></a></h3><p>I originally came across <em>Voidling Bound </em>last year, as they released their demo originally last spring. I’m happy that I can now talk about this monster taming/collecting game in this article, because it is a lot of fun. It takes that idea of finding and collecting monsters and turns it into a third-person shooter as you take control of the little creatures, called Voidlings, and explore and battle on different missions.</p><picture>

  </picture><p>The controls are snappy, the combat fluid, and the variation in creatures and abilities intriguing. <em>Voidling Bound </em>is at its best in its exploration levels, but there’s fun in its hoard levels as well, and the mixture makes for a compelling proposition.</p><h3><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3110830/Bobo_Bay_Demo/" rel="nofollow"><em>Bobo Bay</em></a></h3><p>Sticking with cute little creatures, if you want a less action-packed game with little dudes, <em>Bobo Bay </em>might be up your alley. This is a game that takes inspiration from raising sims, and the Chao Garden from <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/features/top-7-3d-sonic-games" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="2dc244cb-c7c9-44f5-8d24-6555e3a2dce4" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow"><em>Sonic Adventure </em></a>and has you raising these little creatures around and putting them into competitions.&nbsp;</p><picture>

  </picture><p>Get them trained up, fed up, and put them into competitions that their skills are best suited to and eventually into even bigger projects. Beyond that there’s a cheerful energy that infuses the game, and it's fun to move around in a way that a lot of games just don’t have.</p><h3><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4268760/Battlestar_Galactica_Scattered_Hopes_Demo/" rel="nofollow"><em>Battlestar Galactica: Shattered Hopes</em></a></h3><p>From the persistently cheerful realm of <em>Bobo Bay</em>, we go to the darkness of space, and that no less of the 12 Colonies. In command of a small fleet escaping the Cylon destruction, you must guide them through tough decisions and difficult battles as you attempt to rejoin the Battlestar Galactica with your own ship and the civilians you are protecting. More than anything, <em>Shattered Hopes </em>captures the feel of the modern <em>Battlestar Galactica </em>with the grimness, the desperation, and the constant need to keep moving.</p><picture>

  </picture><p>It’s not the highest production tie-in, nor are its battles incredibly complicated, but they are tense, short, and designed to press you to make decisions and accept tradeoffs before you are able to jump away.</p><h3><em>Fading Echo</em></h3><p>This is a fast-paced action-adventure RPG game where you find yourself in control of elements and able to reshape the world around you with it. Turn into a ball of water like Samus’ morph ball and use that to put out fires or bounce around and through the water.&nbsp;</p><picture>

  </picture><p>A story-driven RPG experience, <em>Celestial Return </em>posits a dark, and intriguing world where you play as a burnt-out detective who decides to care one last time. <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/disco-elysium" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="989e82b0-e77a-495c-9583-e4576fdec8c0" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow"><em>Disco Elysium </em></a>meets <em>Blade Runner </em>with an intriguing way of handling luck by treating dice as a resource used for just about everything, and they come in a variety of forms. Combine that with a unique aesthetic and this is a must-play game.</p><h3><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4356650/Darkhaven_Demo/" rel="nofollow"><em>Darkhaven</em></a></h3><p>Like many of my generation, I grew up with <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/diablo-2-resurrected" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="e6b5f480-dae1-474d-b3b6-92fd42fb08ac" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow"><em>Diablo 2</em></a>, and that game is still shaping things with its new expansion and everything else. Somewhere along the way though, the ARPG genre kinda decided that it had already reached peak and just began doing small tweaks on the same format. Don’t get me wrong, I love games like <em>Torchlight </em>too, but I also wonder if anyone was going to ever move the line.</p><p>Well, some of the <em>Diablo </em>and <em>Torchlight </em>crew are back with <em>Darkhaven </em>and their big idea is essentially to mix the ARPG with survival games. Take the items and quests and mix that with the building and destructible world of <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/minecraft" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="f896d9a3-1981-402e-9f6e-c0b67ed170cd" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow"><em>Minecraft</em></a>, and you know what it? It works. The whole part of the world being so changeable creates significant differences in how the game plays, and new exploration options. Building here is kept simple so you aren’t tracking 30 things, and it gives the game a distinct feel.</p><picture>

  </picture><p><em>Darkhaven</em>’s demo here is rawer than others, as the game is also <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/moonbeastproductions/darkhaven-an-action-rpg-with-dynamic-worlds/" rel="nofollow">currently on Kickstarter </a>seeking funding for another year of development. Right now what you have is a pre-alpha where you can see a lot of the seams and raw edges showing, but there’s a lot of promise here and room for something that is very different from what came before.</p><h3><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4210280/Titanium_Court_Demo/" rel="nofollow"><em>Titanium Court</em></a></h3><p>The most surreal game I experienced throughout Next Fest, <em>Titanium Court </em>is out there and it is weird in many many ways. The fourth wall gets leaned on, the world in it is odd, and its got weird-as-hell characters and interface interactions at times that delight in their surreal absurdism.</p><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/titanium-court.jpg?itok=xgKpB8kJ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1920" height="810">

  </picture><p>While that might be enough to get interest, what you’ll find underneath is a deep strategy matching game that is unique in how it plays. The closest in someways is something like <em>Drop Dutchy</em>, but this focuses on match-3 type mechanics, and how different types of blocks and your subjects all interact as you try to maximize returns, minimize invasions, and find your way through a bizarre and compelling narrative.</p><h3><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4291770/Windrose_Demo/" rel="nofollow"><em>Windrose</em></a></h3><p>One of the interesting things you can watch at times on Steam is the population of survival-craft players. They emerge from one and will seemingly migrate en masse to another game. Sometimes you can even predict what the next one will be – and <em>Windrose </em>looks like it.</p><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/windrose.jpg?itok=GsRTaaV_ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1920" height="810">

  </picture><p>And I mean, why not? It looks good, it's a golden age of piracy themed survival game, and it plays pretty well too. It has a bit more combat depth then many of these games, but features all the same tracks you would expect while having a few different things and a focus on sailing and finding treasure that you don’t see elsewhere necessarily in the genre. Arr Matey, hoist the jolly roger and prepare to battle as we seek revenge on Blackbeard himself!</p><h3><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2537470/Vultures__Scavengers_of_Death/" rel="nofollow"><em>Vultures - Scavengers of Death</em></a></h3><p>Have you ever wondered, what would <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/guides/resident-evil-20-years-later" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="cbe64463-3b9a-42c5-9a0c-c274b905de74" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow"><em>Resident Evil </em></a>be like if it was turn based? Well you don’t need to really wonder any more, as <em>Vultures – Scavengers of Death </em>here presents a pitch-perfect take on the '90s horror styling turned into a tactics type experience. Seek what is causing the infected mutants (totally not zombies) to cause problems while managing your scarce resources and gathering more.</p><picture>

<p>For years now, Valve fans have been making jokes about the company’s slow transition from game maker to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/civis/threads/the-team-fortress-2-steam-haberdashery-and-general-store.1163738/">glorified digital hat</a> and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/10/valve-upends-the-cs2-item-marketplace-with-new-trade-up-update/">knife paint marketplace</a>. This week, though, a <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2026/02/new-york-sues-valve-for-enabling-illegal-gambling-with-loot-boxes/">lawsuit brought by the state of New York</a> argues that Valve’s in-game loot box sales amount to an illegal gambling outfit worth tens of billions of dollars.</p>
<p>Lawyers who have looked into the particulars of the case tell Ars that the state faces an uphill battle in convincing courts that this portion of Valve’s business legally constitutes gambling. That said, there are a few elements of the case that might make Valve legally vulnerable to the state’s arguments.</p>
<h2>What is gambling, anyway?</h2>
<p>For a game to legally be counted as “gambling” in most jurisdictions, it has to pass a three-part test: a player has to pay money (1) for an outcome that’s materially determined by chance (2) in the hopes of receiving something of value (3). While buying a key to a loot box in a Valve game easily passes those first two tests, New York’s legal case will likely hinge on whether the random cosmetic items players get from those loot boxes constitute “something of value” for statutory purposes.</p>
<p>Even though loot box purchasers don’t know what item they’ll get, the fact that they know they’re getting <em>something</em> for their money could matter legally. “Gambling traditionally means risking money and possibly getting nothing,” Foundation Law Group Counsel Jonathan Loiterman told Ars. “Here, buyers can’t lose their stake in the traditional gambling sense; they always receive an item. That looks more like buying a randomized product than placing a bet.”</p>
<p>In this way, Valve’s loot boxes are more akin to physical “blind box” toy sales or collectible card packs than a game like blackjack or roulette. In the real world, these kinds of randomized sales “are not considered gambling because the stated value of what you receive is unchanging,” Hoeg Law Firm attorney Richard Hoeg told Ars. “You pay for a pack of cards, you get a pack of cards.”</p>

              If Valve’s loot boxes are a form of gambling, then buying a pack of Pokémon cards probably is as well.

<p>That “stated value” logic can sometimes be even stronger in the digital realm, where the randomized items you get from a loot box are locked to your account and can’t easily be resold. “Digital sellers usually try to get around this by stating that everything sold has zero cash value, so you are always getting ‘nothing,’” as Hoeg put it.</p>
<h2>Come to our Marketplace</h2>
<p>Where Valve might have some unique legal exposure, lawyers tell Ars, is in its operation of the <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/market/">Steam Marketplace</a>, where players can trade in-game items for Steam Wallet funds. Operating that kind of official exchange for players to extract value from items won “starts to look a lot more like gambling,” Hoeg said.</p>

<p>“The problem here is 100% the ability to resell the items from the loot boxes,” attorney and <a href="https://lawofthegame.com/">video game law expert</a> Mark Methenitis tells Ars. “A loot box/gacha mechanic is fine when you can’t turn around and resell the items because you’re not getting something of value. When Valve is also providing a marketplace for those items, they’ve added the third element.”</p>
<p>Still, Loiterman said that the existence of the Steam Marketplace resale market “matters, but it’s not decisive” in this case. While taking a commission on digital item sales “strengthens the argument that these items have economic value,” that fact alone “doesn’t transform a randomized purchase into gambling,” he added.</p>

<p>Part of the problem for New York’s argument is that the Steam Wallet funds players receive for selling their items can only be spent on the Steam platform, putting them a few steps away from cold, hard cash or even casino chips. And while New York’s lawsuit argues that players can get cash out of their Steam Wallets by buying and reselling Steam Deck hardware in the real world, that argument is not a legal slam dunk.</p>

    <div>

        
        <div>
          
          
<p>“Calling it gambling because a user could, through several indirect steps, convert an item into cash risks stretching gambling law beyond its traditional limits,” Loiterman said. “If New York’s theory wins, it raises uncomfortable questions about things like Pokémon cards or promotional games (e.g. McDonald’s Monopoly). Courts will be cautious about going that far.”</p>
<p>New York also argues that Valve tacitly endorses third-party services that allow players to easily “cash out” their Steam inventories for real money. Whether Valve is culpable for the existence of those services is still an unsettled question in the law, Methenitis said, as it has been at least since he <a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=987056">wrote about the legal implications of <em>World of Warcraft</em>‘s third-party gold resellers</a> nearly two decades ago.</p>
<p>“I think companies have a pretty strong [legal] argument if they make some attempts to police [third-party resellers]—they obviously can’t fully control what people do outside their platform,” Methenitis said. “But if they turn a blind eye to it and allow it, I think they could be found liable.” Loiterman agreed that Valve “providing the tools that enable those [third-party] markets and tolerating them creates some degree of responsibility.”</p>
<h2>“Judges tend to be cautious…”</h2>
<p>In the end, the lawyers Ars spoke to were generally skeptical that courts would determine that Valve’s loot box system constitutes illegal gambling. Cases making similar arguments about other loot box systems have failed in other jurisdictions, “in part because gambling laws were drafted with casinos and lotteries in mind,” Loiterman said. “Judges tend to be cautious about breaking from an emerging consensus.”</p>
<p>Hoeg agreed that “the entire question [in this case] is novel, and… the courts are (small-‘c’) conservative institutions, not generally wanting to adopt novel arguments without direction from the legislative branches.” Even if Valve’s loot box system “may start to smell a bit like gambling,” Hoeg said he would “honestly be surprised if the courts went along with the characterization without a new law aimed at it.”</p>
<p>“I view it as a weak case offered primarily for political grandstanding/coverage over real legal effect,” Hoeg concluded. “We shall see, though.”</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
      <p>The <em>Resident Evil</em> series, historically, has been about a lot of things. Zombies, obviously, but also the global ravages of a feckless pharmaceutical company and, in its own often-campy way, the politics surrounding that. You might remember, for example, that time all of Raccoon City <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rr-aVIri1Mo&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><u>got obliterated by a nuclear bomb</u></a>. Charged imagery, to be sure, but was <em>Resident Evil 3</em> trying to say anything weighty or consequential with it back then? And what is <em>Resident Evil Requiem</em>, in returning to that setting, trying to say with it now? On the latest Aftermath Hours, we attempt to answer those questions.</p><p>This time around we’re joined by two critics who’ve played through <em>Requiem </em>and <a href="https://www.theringer.com/2026/02/25/video-games/resident-evil-has-always-been-horrifying-and-hilarious-requiem?ref=aftermath.site"><u>articulated their thoughts about it</u></a>: freelancer and Aftermath columnist Joshua Rivera and Polygon editor-at-large Giovanni Colantonio, whose <a href="https://www.polygon.com/resident-evil-requiem-review/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>review of <em>Requiem</em></u></a><em> </em>– which put the game in conversation with the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki – has drawn some pretty vocal criticism these past few days. We discuss whether or not the text of the game actually supports that kind of close thematic read.</p><p>We also discuss <em>Resident Evil</em> more broadly: where it’s coming from, where it’s going, and of course, where <em>Requiem </em>fits into all of that. The series has spent its past few installments promising a fresh start; does <em>Requiem </em>actually deliver, or is it lured astray by the siren’s call of Leon Kennedy-flavored nostalgia? And during an era that’s decidedly post-zombie, what makes this series, in particular, so enduring?</p><p>Finally, we come up with some truly diabolical remake ideas for old-school games and conclude that there’s actually no such thing as a long or short game. Who needs to stick around for 100 hours when you can make your own ending whenever you want to?</p><p>You can find this week's episode below and on <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/7qtlX6MNeEoyNuHBU0chUJ?si=a2f12b75911f43cb&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><u>Spotify</u></a>, <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/aftermath-hours/id1727407094?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Apple</u></a>, or wherever else you prefer to listen to podcasts.

<!--kg-card-end: html-->
<p>Here’s an excerpt from our conversation (edited for length and clarity):</p><p><strong>Giovanni:</strong> It’s tough because there are specific moments – and this is the tough thing about a pre-release write up – I want to point to that are off limits for now, and there’s a question to be had about “Eh, maybe that should wait [until after release] to have the full scope of the thing.” I’ve always heard [Hiroshima and Nagasaki] referenced in terms of <em>Resident Evil 3</em>; I’ve heard people talk about that. I’ve never quite bought into it. I’ve always thought of it like the ‘90s and “Cool guys don’t look at explosions.” Everything blows up in these games. I never paid much mind to that.</p><p>There are a couple moments in <em>Requiem </em>that I do think kind of, to varying degrees of explicitness, at least reference it. Not saying it specifically, but there is one case where I think it does actually point to it in a way that’s surprising. But I started thinking about it [in terms of] “Is this a game that is looking back at what happened in <em>Resident Evil 3</em> and looking at it through the lens of a greater tragedy?” I was doing research into that, and I found an old research paper from 2019 that was focused on [original<em> Resident Evil </em>director] Shinji Mikami’s work. It was a piece about unpacking a lot of that post-war feeling in his work. I don’t know that I even necessarily fully agree with that research paper. There were some parts of it where I was like “<em>Dino Crisis</em> fits into this? I don’t know. Seems like a stretch.”&nbsp;</p><p>But I think it got the wheels turning, and with some of the symbols and lines that are in <em>Requiem</em>, I got to thinking about if this is a game about Leon dealing with a trauma that is referencing the trauma [of nuclear devastation]? And are we supposed to take it as he’s experiencing this long aftermath of this trauma that’s coming from a real place of anxiety?</p><p>So that’s how I got onto that train of thought, and I do think there are things you can point to that are there. I think the question that arises, though, is: Even if that stuff is there, is <em>Resident Evil</em> equipped to talk about that in any way? I’ve been thinking about that a lot in the past couple days. This has always been a series that has political undertones in its lore. There’s an evil Big Pharma company, and it’s making bioweapons and trading those with the US government.</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cpas81Pd97Q&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><u>Zombie president</u></a>!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Giovanni: </strong>Yeah, there’s weird threads. They’ve always been kinda funny, but there’s also stuff in there that’s very strange and pointed. A distrust for authority is baked into all of Shinji Mikami’s work – even <em>Dino Crisis</em>. So the question that arises for me that I haven’t fully unpacked yet is, even if that’s what the reference is – and I think it’s fair to say “Eh, that’s probably a stretch” – is <em>Resident Evil</em> as a series, a goofy thing, equipped to deal with something like that? And is any triple-A game?&nbsp;</p><p>Josh, you wrote something that I really love; you say that even if games reference something like this, what do you <em>do </em>in the game? What does the gameplay come down to at the end of the day? <em>Resident Evil Requiem</em>, at the end of the day, is a big, fun shooting action game where you’re killing zombies, and zombies are the bodies of the dead. How do we feel about that [in this context]?</p><p>Josh, is there space for <em>Resident Evil</em> as you’ve talked about it, as a work of pure schlock, to talk about things and reference them, or should we take it as being a little too dumb to really say anything serious about this – and interpreting it that way is kind of a fool’s errand?</p><p><strong>Joshua:</strong> I think it’s a fool’s errand. I also think the series is capable of [aspiring to something more serious] if they wanted to. My example in support of this is actually <em>Resident Evil 7</em>, which opens with a very clear <em>Texas Chainsaw Massacre</em> homage. There’s some hicksploitation going on there. And it has a scene at the very end where you link with the mold, which is the evil presence – it’s very silly – that’s made these people what they are. That neglect from this pharmaceutical company poisoned these people’s land and turned them into monsters. You get to speak with the real Jack Baker, a sympathetic, tragic figure. </p><p>I think the game means that. I think the people behind the game were interested in some type of pathos because that’s part of what they wanted to do with that game: ground you not just in Ethan Winters and the first-person [perspective], but also relating to these characters as you would in the first-person.&nbsp;</p><p>So I do think the games are capable of it; I don’t think this game is interested in that. I don’t think it’s crazy for someone to see what you saw, Gio, and to consider it in relation to the game. But I do think there is a matter of scope and justification. That’s a big check that you write – that anybody writes if they’re pulling from something outside of the text. The sticking point for me, then, is “How do I justify referencing a real historical tragedy and also a people in connection to that tragedy?”</p><p>The first thing I would go to is just a simple question of visual language. I think about 9/11; because of the generation we’re a part of, most people in the creative workforce are about our age or older. We have a visual language for how a city falls apart. We have a very specific image culturally for what that looks like. So if we are going to show a city falling apart, that is what we’re gonna think of and that is what we’re gonna replicate. Does it mean that the work in which we do that is about that? Not necessarily. Then again, this is also a matter of interpretation and intent. They could be totally separate things. This is what [the concept of] death of the author talks about.</p><p>For example, <em>The Avengers</em>. That’s very much a movie about “What if we could stop 9/11?” That’s not necessarily what the people who made that movie were thinking, but that’s kind of what’s in that movie. Or the new <em>Superman </em>movie – maybe less so. I think that movie has different aims.&nbsp;</p><p>You put even more of a burden of proof on yourself when you also invoke a people and a place and a culture in addition to the imagery of a historical event. That’s where I’ve got my guard up. I’m gonna call out something specifically, and it was not something that was in your review; this is something I saw in defense of your review from people who read it, and it really bugged me. People were like “It makes sense and it’s natural to think of Hiroshima in a work made by Japanese people featuring a bombed city.” It’s one of those “Listen to yourself” moments. Natural for you. That is your only frame of reference for this place, this people, this culture. You swap out any other atrocity with any other group of people, and fuck you, you know? “It’s natural for this Latino man to be evoking colonialism and the conquest of Borinquen.” Listen to yourself.&nbsp;</p><p>I think what’s interesting – and what I struggle with a little bit in your reading, Giovanni – is that you do evoke the Hibakusha [bombing survivors]. We know how Japanese culture evokes that imagery. They were a protected class. There is a very sober and sacred evocation of these people and what they went through. If we think this is something that is being referenced, I think we would also see that somber, careful treatment [in <em>Requiem</em>]. And I don’t think that’s there. So for me, that’s not where I would go.</p><p><strong>Giovanni: </strong>Yeah, fair enough. I think that’s a really interesting way to read it, because yeah, I agree: If we are talking about survivors, this is a tough series to put that into! And again, I do think there are little references to it – there are things to my read that that’s coming from – but I don’t think that necessarily means that’s what the game is about. </p><p>I would actually argue, and I want to make this clear: I think the game, if we’re giving it an About, is very broadly about trauma. It’s about Grace experiencing it on this micro scale, dealing with the loss of her mother; it’s about Leon dealing with it on a larger scale of “All these people in this city that I was sworn to protect are gone.” It’s having two characters face that in very different ways – almost a fight or flight response between them. That’s what I would say the game is actually about, and that’s the wider point that I would point to if we were getting into that.&nbsp;</p><p>But yeah, I agree: If the intent is to invoke this [real-world tragedy], it’s certainly not terribly respectful. And I think that’s a good point, to be like “Well, you would think that they would be more respectful if that was the case.” I think that’s legitimate. </p><h2 id="recommended">Recommended</h2><figure><a href="https://aftermath.site/resident-evil-requiem-nintendo/"><div><p>Nintendo’s Trailers Of Violent Games Are Full Of (Purposefully?)

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>It's apparently been confirmed that <em>Pokemon FireRed and LeafGreen </em>on Switch have a quality-of-life feature that will make catching certain legendary Pokemon much, much easier.</p><p>As spotted by <a href="https://x.com/RexProfessor/status/2027432141357781395" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Professor Rex on X</a> (and isn't that pleasing to say?), a Japanese <a href="https://x.com/_Gon_z" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">speedrunner</a> has uncovered a neat change in the Switch versions of the GBA classics, and it pertains to the Aurora Ticket and Mystic Ticket items.</p><p>In the original Game Boy Advance games, obtaining these tickets was only possible through Mystery Gift events, so if you wanted to catch the legendary Pokemon Deoxys, Ho-Oh, and Lugia, you'd need to have been around during those events. Now, that's no longer the case.</p><figure role="group">

<figcaption><em>Pokemon FireRed and LeafGreen </em>on Switch<em> </em>now simply hand you two very hard-to-find tickets from the original.</figcaption>

<p>In the Switch version, however, both of those tickets are simply automatically handed to you upon beating the Elite Four, at least according to the aforementioned Japanese speedrunner's playthrough of the game.</p><p>This means that you'll have the chance to confront Deoxys, Ho-Oh, and Lugia over the course of a normal playthrough rather than needing to be in the right place at the right time, which is great news for those of us who chronically miss these kinds of events.</p><p>Just in case you missed the news, <em>Pokemon FireRed and LeafGreen </em>were <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-firered-leafgreen-switch" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="057d121c-d519-4dfa-af54-03ce59fa9f52" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">re-released on Switch today</a> as part of the franchise's 30th anniversary. Nintendo has also promised that the games will feature <em>Pokemon Home </em>compatibility at some point in the future.</p><p>These anniversary celebrations also saw the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-winds-and-waves-2027" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="5a4357a0-4d69-4440-91bf-2d036a750be0" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">long-awaited announcement</a> of <em>Pokemon</em>'s tenth generation earlier today, with <em>Pokemon Winds and Waves </em>due to launch exclusively on Switch 2 sometime next year.</p>
