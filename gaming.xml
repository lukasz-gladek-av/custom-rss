            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">News of a Switch 2 version will be announced "very soon."</h2></div><div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">As Stardew Valley fans continue to wait patiently for the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/stardew-valley-creator-eric-concerned-ape-barone-confirms-update-17-is-coming-but-he-doesnt-want-too-much-hype-at-this-point">previously announced 1.7 update</a>, creator Eric Barone (ConcernedApe) has dropped a couple small, vague, yet exciting hints about what said mysterious update might entail: a new farm type, and "more character/social stuff."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This comes from a tweet/X post from ConcernedApe, where he was asked if he could give any hints about the upcoming update. His response was pretty simple: "there will be some more character/social stuff, it's also traditional to add a new farm type. Lots more but I don't want to reveal much yet."</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">there will be some more character/social stuff, it's also traditional to add a new farm type. Lots more but I don't want to reveal much yet</p>— ConcernedApe (@ConcernedApe) <a href="https://twitter.com/ConcernedApe/status/2001186320765583409?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">December 17, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">That's not a ton of detail, but certainly enough to spark the imagination. The new farm type was indeed to be expected. Stardew Valley started with just one style of farm map, and since its release, most major new content updates have added at least one for a total of eight different options. Each farm map centers around a different specialty, with the Standard map being fairly generic and open-ended, and other maps promoting fishing, foraging, mining, combat, multiplayer, a combination of fishing and foraging, and animal raising. Currently, this means that basically every type of playstyle is supported, so there's a lot left to wonder about when it comes to imagining what new farm type could be added. Perhaps something that encourages building NPC friendships?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The "character/social stuff" is a little more vague. This could mean anything from new scenes and events with existing characters to new characters entirely. It's really hard to say at this stage!</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Popular fan requests for future Stardew Valley features include more NPCs, including more romanceable NPCs, more dialogue and world lore, but also just generally more of everything: more animals, more crops, more decorations, more clothing, more enemies to fight, dishes to cook, and so forth. ConcernedApe <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/stardew-valley-creator-eric-concerned-ape-barone-confirms-update-17-is-coming-but-he-doesnt-want-too-much-hype-at-this-point">hasn't really revealed anything so far about what 1.7 will contain</a>, or even when we might expect it. He's given no release date, only suggested that it's possible it doesn't come out until after Haunted Chocolatier releases. Maybe. It'll be ready when it's ready.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">ConcernedApe did drop one other thing, though. When asked about a potential Nintendo Switch 2 edition, he said he's announce something "<a href="https://x.com/ConcernedApe/status/2001155907833753682?s=20" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">very soon</a>." A Switch 2 edition <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/videos/stardew-valley-official-nintendo-switch-2-edition-trailer-nintendo-direct">was first announced back in September</a>, and will bring mouse controls, four-player split screen multiplayer, and Game Share multiplayer to the Switch version. No release date has been given yet.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We re-reviewed Stardew Valley in 2024 to account for its many, many updates since launch in 2016. While our original review gave it <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2016/03/25/stardew-valley-review">an impressive 8.8/10</a>, the re-review <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/stardew-valley-review-2024">called it a 10/10 masterpiece</a>, saying, "Stardew Valley is not only the best farming game I’ve played, it is one of my favorite games of all time. That myself and others keep returning to this eight-year old gem each time it gets even the smallest update speaks to how it’s truly a masterpiece in the genre it both reinvigorated and has come to define."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

              <p><a href="https://gameinformer.com/2018/07/12/longtime-bioware-vet-james-ohlen-retires-from-games-industry">James Ohlen</a> joined Wizards of the Coast <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/james-ohlen-joins-wizards-of-the-coast">back in 2019</a> after a 22-year stint at BioWare to create a new IP for the Hasbro-owned tabletop gaming company. Six years later, after cofounding Archetype Entertainment to ship a very <em>Mass Effect</em>-looking RPG <a href="https://kotaku.com/exodus-trailer-scifi-rpg-matthew-mcconaughey-1851674488">called <em>Exodus</em></a>, he’ll no longer be head of the studio when the game eventually ships in 2027.</p> <p>“At this stage, James felt his work on the game was complete and that the polishing and tuning were in great hands with the team,” Hasbro VP of Communications Abby Hodes <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-12-17/hasbro-hires-new-video-game-boss-as-exodus-studio-head-steps-down?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc2NjAwNjU2MywiZXhwIjoxNzY2NjExMzYzLCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJUN0ZOOEpLSVAzSlQwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.DsXTL5uiyiElHnbXg3lBhhoGNbYoIOcplrfvRhfCrLw">told <em>Bloomberg</em></a> in a statement. She added that Ohlen asked to “shift his creative focus” and would remain a consultant for the company on tabletop gaming.</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">This is James Ohlen. He was the lead designer for Baldur's Gate 1 &amp; 2, Dragon Age: Origins, Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic and now he's making EXODUS.</p> <p>He has been referred to as the "godfather of Bioware design".

It’s an expensive-looking game from a brand new studio that began work during the pandemic, which might be part of why the delayed project is still a couple of years from launching.</p>

 <p>But <em>Exodus</em> isn’t just the potential start of a new franchise, it’s an entire world that Hasbro wants to use as a springboard for other products. Wizards released an <em>Exodus</em> <a href="https://ttrpg.store.exodusgame.com/?fbclid=PAQ0xDSwMR2gNleHRuA2FlbQIxMQABp9kE9hc3UJPQ0PP0i_inu10Pi6VbPjeWCFVkVhGOOKLvOciRaubmZ8vQQP9g_aem_OILHflwjwSOk5SahfUXFWw">TTRPG book</a> earlier this year and would no doubt love to look at trading card and TV spin-offs if the game eventually becomes a <em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em>-like hit.</p> <p>Bloomberg also reports that Ohlen stepping down comes alongside Blizzard veteran and <a href="https://kotaku.com/former-blizzard-boss-mike-morhaime-launches-dreamhaven-1845152912">Dreamhaven</a> co-founder Paul Della Bitta becoming head of Wizards’ Digital Ventures division underneath fellow Blizzard veteran John Hight. Plenty of other BioWare veterans still remain at Archetype, including Chad Robertson and Drew Karpyshyn.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Here Are 10 Great RPGs You Can Add To Your Collection For Surprisingly Cheap]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/rpg-sale-cheap-ff12-kingdom-come-2-ps5-switch-2000653958</link>
            <guid>1386577</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>This time of year makes me miss being a kid and <a href="https://kotaku.com/what-s-the-best-or-worst-gaming-gift-youve-ever-recei-1845928462">unwrapping a cool new RPG</a> I could then spend the winter quietly toiling through. Not an internet guide in sight. Just a fan living in the moment. So I’m always on the lookout to see what games are getting discounted during the holiday sell-off in case there are one or two things I can pick up and add to my physical collection for cheap. I might even wrap them and put them in a stocking or under the tree and pretend they’re from Santa.</p> <p>Here are a few of the good deals out there so far. I’ll be on the lookout for more and will update the list if I find them. Please feel free to share any good ones you’ve spotted in the comments as well.</p> <h2><em>Visons of Mana&nbsp;</em></h2> <p>The whimsical action-RPG is currently <a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/product/visions-of-mana-playstation-5/">just $20 everywhere</a> across both PS5 and Xbox Series X|S (physical only). It’s a surprisingly decent stab at reinvigorating the <em>Mana</em> franchise after more than a decade without a real sequel.</p>

 <h2><em>Final Fantasy 16</em></h2> <p>This one’s also $20 <a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/product/final-fantasy-xvi-standard-edition-playstation-5/JXL9RG8LSC">at most stores</a> this week, a steal for a 2023 GOTY contender that shines despite its most glaring flaws. The music, performances, and cinematic boss fights are all top-tier and the action feels great even when it gets repetitive.</p>

 <h2><em>Unicorn Overlord</em></h2> <p>This Vanillaware strategy RPG also gets a bit repetitive in the back half but is worth it for the current price of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Unicorn-Overlord/dp/B0CJ4KF5J7?tag=kotaku01-20">just $25 across PS5 and Switch</a>. The story makes no sense but the art is exceptional and the mash-up of turn-based combat and RTS micro-management is enough to keep you powering through.</p>

 <h2><em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2</em></h2> <p>I’m still not very far in Warhorse Studios’ open-world immersive sim but I’m liking it a lot more than the first game. It’s also surprisingly cheap for a 2025 Game Awards nominee. It’s just $40 for PS5 and only $30 for Xbox. The PS5 version’s also been going <a href="https://www.gamestop.com/video-games/playstation-5/products/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii---playstation-5/408117.html">in and out of stock</a> at GameStop for the same lower price.</p>

 <h2><em>Fantasian Neo Dimension</em></h2> <p>Don’t let the mobile game origins fool you. <em>Fantasian Neo Dimension</em> is the good stuff. Mistwalker’s Hironobu Sakaguchi channels his early <em>Final Fantasy</em> roots to deliver a slick turn-based adventure that feels like it would have been right at home on the PS1. Amazon has the PS5 and Switch copies for <a href="https://www.amazon.com/FANTASIAN-Neo-Dimension/dp/B0DHYGHQCJ?tag=kotaku01-20">just $30</a>.</p>

 <h2><em>Mega Man Battle Network Legacy Collection</em></h2> <p>I’ve been meaning to pick this one up for a while and for some reason it’s just $20 right now <a href="http://Mega Man Battle Network Legacy Collection">on Amazon</a>. The games themselves are very similar but the hybrid strategy gameplay remains peak Game Boy Advance nostalgia.</p> <h2><em>Final Fantasy XII: The Zodiac Age</em></h2> <p>I feel like <em>FF12</em> is a bit underrated these days. It’s pound-for-pound one of the densest entries in the series and the remaster does an excellent job of polishing up the PS2 visuals and improving some of the job board progression to make it feel more like a familiar job-based MMO system. It’s only $25 on both PS5 and Switch <a href="https://www.amazon.com/FINAL-FANTASY-XII-THE-ZODIAC-AGE/dp/B01GOQHDJ4?tag=kotaku01-20">at the moment</a>.</p>

 <h2><em>Final Fantasy Pixel Remaster</em></h2> <p>Is the Pixel Remaster collection overpriced? Yes. Are the smoothmaster visuals a bummer? Also yes. But you can’t get too picky about owning a piece of history. Adding it to your collection <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Final-Fantasy-I-VI-Pixel-Remaster-Collection/dp/B0DCKFZ1V6?tag=kotaku01-20">for just $40</a> isn’t bad.</p> <h2><em>Super Mario RPG</em></h2> <p>You’ll probably never own the original SNES version of <em>Super Mario RPG</em>. Used copies start at $50. Nice ones are quite a bit more. The Switch remaster, which looks excellent and improves combat with a new ultimate system, is a great pickup <a href="https://www.gamestop.com/video-games/nintendo-switch/products/super-mario-rpg---nintendo-switch/396423.html">at just $25 right now</a>.</p> <h2><em>Persona 3 Reload</em></h2> <p>The physical version for PS5 is currently just $17 at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Persona-3-Reload-Standard-PlayStation-5/dp/B0CGFCC193?tag=kotaku01-20">Amazon</a> and only $25 a <a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/product/persona-3-reload-launch-edition-playstation-5/">Best Buy</a>. It’s a stellar remake and probably my favorite game in the series at this point. Not as flashy as <em>Persona 5</em> but with way better melancholy teen vibes.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">But it's not enough to fund a new project.</h2></div><div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Horses, the indie horror game that was banned from both Steam and the Epic Games Store ahead of its launch two weeks ago, has nonetheless managed to sell over 18,000 copies, says publisher Santa Ragione. However, that's not enough for the publisher to fund a new game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This comes from a press release sent today by Santa Ragione, which says Horses has generated approximately $65,000 in net revenue thanks to sales on GOG and Humble [Disclaimer: Humble and IGN are both owned and run by IGN Entertainment, a subsidiary of Ziff Davis, Inc.]. That was enough to pay royalties owed to creator Andrea Lucco Borlera, as well as pay off the loans the publisher took out to finish development.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But that's not enough to begin work on a new game, and it doesn't seem likely that amount will be reached despite the significant attention the game's controversy gleaned. The team members are still planning to take on other jobs and projects, with the hope that the publisher may be able to fund a new prototype in the future if sales remain steady for long enough.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"While the launch of HORSES compares very favourably to our most recent launches on Steam, Steam’s economics rely heavily on multi-year long tail sales and, for our past projects, on Steam key distribution through bundles, which has also lately been restricted for low-selling titles," the publisher said in a statement. "These structural differences are why a strong two week result on smaller storefronts does not tell us what a full Steam release could have looked like."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Horses is a horror game that follows a young man who travels to a horse farm to work for several weeks during the summer, only to discover that the farm's "horses" are actually naked humans with horse masks forcibly attached over their heads. The game explores themes of complicity and what horrors people are willing to participate in, via the farmer and eventually protagonist's treatment and continued enslavement of these people.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The game contains a lot of disturbing imagery, including violence and sexual content, but none of that's new for either Steam or Epic. Nevertheless, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/unsettling-horror-game-horses-banned-from-steam-leaving-studio-with-high-risk-of-closure">Horses was banned from Steam two years ago</a> after the team submitted an in-progress prototype. While some suggestions were given as to the reason for the ban, no specifics were shared with the team at the time, nor was there an opportunity to appeal. Santa Ragione believes Valve may have objected to a scene present in the earlier version where a child "rode" one of the naked horses by sitting on their shoulders and being carried around. That character was aged up to an adult in the final version of the game, and there are no underaged individuals in the released version.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Horses Gameplay Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">With Valve unbending, Santa Ragione said at the time it may have to close its doors, due to the overwhelming necessity of a Steam release for most games to recoup development costs. The publisher put its hopes in Epic, GOG, and Humble, but at the last minute right before launch, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/horses-the-upsetting-horror-game-previously-banned-on-steam-gets-last-minute-ban-from-epic-games-store-too">Epic also banned the game</a>, with Epic citing violations of its policies on "inappropriate content" and "hateful or abusive content." </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Both bans prompted a wave of criticism from developers and audience members, who called out the banning of the game as both censorship as well as hypocritical, given some of the other content that's allowed on Steam in particular. Santa Ragione specifically has called out Valve for having unclear policies and communication, problems that it feels essentially ensured the studio's demise.</p><blockquote>We also want to emphasize that this outcome should not distract from the broader issue at stake: the need for clearer rules, transparent processes, and meaningful accountability from near monopolistic distribution platforms and the systems they enforce. For every case like HORSES that becomes visible, there are many more games that are quietly banned, delisted, or trapped in indefinite review for unclear reasons, with developers too worried about retaliation or future approval to speak publicly. We are grateful to the journalists and outlets who have reported, and who will continue to report, on these cases.</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">Critical response to Horses has been across the board, with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/horses-review">our own reviewer</a> giving it a 7/10 and calling it "an affecting first-person horror game that, despite some repetitive tasks and signposting issues, delivers a harrowing story you won’t forget in a hurry." </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Publisher Santa Ragione has a long history of both developing and publishing standout games. Its most recent successes are Mediterranea Inferno, which it published from developer Eyeguys and which won Excellence in Narrative at the 2024 Independent Games Festival, as well as nominations for the Seumas McNally Grand Prize and Nuovo Award. Saturnalia, developed in-house and released in 2022, received generally positive reviews. Both games remain available on Steam and Epic.</p></section><div><h3 data-cy="title3"><svg data-cy="icon-logo" viewBox="0 0 76 24" title="IGN"><title>IGN Logo</title><path fill="currentColor" stroke="none" d="M5.38 7.65a7.85 7.85 0 0 1 2.26-2.26c.13-1.18.31-2.26.52-3.21a10.605 10.605 0 0 0-6 6c.95-.22 2.03-.39 3.21-.52M16.34 5.36v.02c.9.59 1.67 1.37 2.27 2.27 1.18.13 2.26.31 3.21.52a10.627 10.627 0 0 0-6.02-6.01c.22.95.4 2.02.54 3.2M7.64 18.62c-.9-.59-1.67-1.37-2.27-2.27h-.03c-1.19-.14-2.26-.32-3.19-.54 1.07 2.75 3.26 4.95 6.01 6.02-.22-.95-.39-2.03-.52-3.21M18.64 16.35h-.03c-.59.9-1.37 1.67-2.27 2.27v.03c-.14 1.17-.32 2.25-.54 3.19a10.59 10.59 0 0 0 6.03-6.03c-.94.22-2 .4-3.19.54M10.04 0h3.9c.85 1.85 1.2 4.59 1.3 5.52.04.22.06.43.06.63L12 9.11 8.7 6.15c0-.17.02-.35.05-.55.1-.95.43-3.75 1.29-5.61M8.7 17.83c0 .17.02.35.05.55.1.95.43 3.75 1.29 5.61h3.9c.85-1.84 1.2-4.59 1.3-5.52.04-.22.06-.43.06-.64L12 14.87l-3.3 2.96ZM6.16 8.68c-.17 0-.35.02-.55.05-.95.12-3.75.45-5.61 1.31v3.9c1.84.85 4.59 1.19 5.52 1.3.22.04.43.06.64.06L9.11 12 6.16 8.7ZM24 10.02c-1.86-.86-4.66-1.19-5.61-1.29-.2-.03-.38-.05-.55-.05l-2.96 3.3 2.96 3.3c.2 0 .41-.02.64-.06.93-.11 3.68-.45 5.52-1.3v-3.9Z"></path><path fill="currentColor" stroke="none" d="M42.83 13.9V10h10.45c1.06 0 1.93.86 1.93 1.92v4.63c0 2.38-1.91 4.36-4.33 4.36h-6.69c-4.96 0-8.97-4-8.97-8.94s4.04-8.95 8.98-8.95h10.36v4.11H44.2c-2.67 0-4.86 2.17-4.86 4.84s2.16 4.83 4.86 4.83h6.91v-2.91h-8.27ZM33.86 3h-4.07v16.02c0 1.05.86 1.91 1.91 1.91h2.15V3M74.37 3.01h-2.18v13.81s0 .08-.03.11a.29.29 0 0 1-.24.14c-.09 0-.16-.04-.25-.15L64.83 4.93a4.347 4.347 0 0 0-3.72-2.11h-.07c-2.39 0-4.32 1.93-4.32 4.32v11.88c0 1.05.86 1.91 1.91 1.91h2.17V7.14s.02-.09.04-.13a.29.29 0 0 1 .24-.14c.09 0 .18.03.24.14l6.88 12.07c.76 1.27 2.12 2.05 3.69 2.05h.07c2.39 0 4.32-1.93 4.32-4.32V4.92c0-1.05-.85-1.91-1.91-1.91"></path></svg>Recommends</h3></div></div><div><h3 data-cy="object-summary-embed-title">In This Article</h3></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/horses-sells-over-18k-copies-pays-back-loans-and-royalties-despite-removal-from-steam-and-epic]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://aftermath.site/online-games-down-update-warframe-old-peace/</link>
            <guid>1386541</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
      <p>Last week, <em>Warframe</em>’s <a href="https://aftermath.site/warframe-old-peace-world-war-one-interview-tennocon/"><u>hotly anticipated <em>Old Peace</em> update</u></a> launched, kicking off a saga that digs into the very foundations of the nearly 13-year-old game’s lore. Of course, like clockwork, <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/warframes-the-old-peace-update-servers-issues/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>servers immediately took a tumble</u></a>, resulting in crashes, outages, and chat issues. But why has this pattern become so predictable with online games? Especially when developers are well aware that a storm of their own making is on the horizon?</p><p>During a Game Awards-adjacent event celebrating <em>The Old Peace</em>’s launch last week, I asked creative director Rebb Ford.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>"You've gotta spin up capacity,” she told Aftermath, referring to the practice of paying money to a distribution partner for additional servers ahead of or during moments when many players will be trying to access content. “You're allowing so many connections. We're an always-online game, right, so every time a player does something, there's a server call. There's something that needs to be verified server and client side. … Login, mission complete, anything that needs to talk to us to say 'You did this, you did that’ – it happens to us at a volume level that's very hard to account for."</p><p>In <em>The Old Peace</em>’s case, Digital Extremes was ready for a stampede the moment it opened the gates, but not quite ready enough.</p><p>"We actually didn't fall over as much as I thought we would,” said Ford. “That's when we realized 'Oh, we didn't think this was gonna be bigger than TennoCon [<em>Warframe</em>’s annual convention that often drives record player numbers].' We spun up IRC servers, we spun up things just to deal with volume. But sometimes you just cannot be prepared enough when you didn't predict it to be the third-best day in the history of the game. That was an error on our part, but it's not so much a tech error; it was an anticipation error. We fixed it very quickly."</p><p>The ability to quickly rectify server issues is also the result of preparation – in some cases <em>years </em>of preparation.</p><p>"One of our most important things to do is make sure people can get the content as fast as possible,” said Ford. “With <em>Warframe</em>, when we have the build or the update, we release it to our distributing partners, and we do something called a pre-heat of our CDN, or content delivery network – which is basically us saying 'People shouldn't all be fetching the game data from one node.' Because that will take forever. It'll get congested. So we distribute it, and this is through years of network partner shopping, working with really good network partners. We have content servers in 16 or 17 central population hubs."</p><p>The pre-heat, Ford explained, ensures that the whole network doesn’t hinge on a single point of potential failure.</p><p>“So sometimes you'll be going in the Philippines instead of being routed to our deploying headquarters, which is Ontario,” she said. “We pre-heated our server structure across the globe so that people can fetch [new content] quicker, and that takes a lot of load off.”</p><p>But that’s only one stair in what Ford characterized as a winding staircase of individual, overlapping needs.</p><p>"So that's the first point of failure: Can you download the game at all?” she said. “Second point of failure is: Can you login at all? When that happens, that all comes to us through login capacity. That one, you just have to spin up more capacity. Then you have the question of 'Can people play missions?' So you can kind of see the staircase: Can you download the game? Can you login to the game? Can you play the game? And each one of those is a slightly different sector of stability."</p><p>In <em>Warframe</em>’s case, elements can function independently, but if they’re not all working in conjunction, players quickly begin to see the seams.</p><p>“A lot of people can be logged into the game, and that's cool, but if you can't play, [then there's a problem],” said Ford. “It's like Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs. Can you chat? You don't need chat to play the game, but chat servers run independently. Those were hit the hardest [on <em>Old Peace</em> launch day], and we fixed it fairly fast by spinning up more capacity."&nbsp;</p><p>Games are complicated, as is the process of distributing them to millions of different computers with as many hardware configurations as there are stars in the sky. You will not be surprised to learn, then, that many other things can also go wrong.</p><p>“We have issues where we release new code in this build, and then maybe one piece of code fires every second on a heartbeat,” Ford said. “And sometimes we find these heartbeats, and we're like 'What is pinging the servers every second on the second,' and we're like 'It's the new title system we put in,' for example. ‘It's checking against server-client to issue you a title, but it's doing it in a way where we were unsure because it's checking all this indexed stuff.’"</p><p><em>Warframe </em>has been around for over a decade and regularly pulls in tens – or in <em>Old Peace</em> launch day’s case, hundreds – of thousands of concurrent players. Nonetheless, said Ford, Digital Extremes still frets about The Ramifications as though it were a much smaller company.</p><p>"We still feel very young and scrappy, and we're like 'Can we even afford $600 more per month in capacity?'” she said. “That's the kind of question we ask ourselves on launch day. And then we're like 'Just do it! Just do it!'"</p><p><em>Warframe</em>’s servers weren’t quite able to withstand the sheer weight of years’ worth of anticipation on launch day, but Ford was relieved that they didn’t go down for “hours and hours,” which would’ve necessitated a suitably less jubilant speech at the launch event in LA.&nbsp;</p><p>"It's exciting. It's thrilling. Everyone did an amazing job,” she said. “We asked our team to do the impossible with this update, so even though those little hiccups happened, we had two speeches prepared – funeral or the celebration – and we undoubtedly got to do the celebration."</p><h2 id="recommended">Recommended</h2><figure><a href="https://aftermath.site/runescape-jagex-engine-sound-development/"><div><p>Let’s Meet A Runescape Developer Who Worked On Everything From Billing To Engines To HTML5 - Aftermath</p><p>‘I gave RuneScape 32-bit sound’</p><p><span>Luke Plunkett</span></p></div></a></figure>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Fresh from awarding their coveted Peace Prize, FIFA are returning to gaming and it is Netflix, rather established software giant, who are to release the game in time for the 2026 World Cup. You will also be able to play it on “selected” televisions with a controller and on your phone via the Netflix mobile app.</p>
<p>The game will be developed and published by Delphi Interactive, a company that has yet to release a game but is actually involved with 007: First Light. Delphi licensed James Bond and then partnered with IO Interactive who will make and publish the game.&nbsp; Delphi’s CEO Casper Daugaard has said “We believe that, on average, the legacy publishers have become fundamentally misaligned with the owners of the world’s biggest IP.”</p>


<p>“The FIFA World Cup is going to be the cultural event of 2026, and now fans will be able to celebrate their fandom by bringing the game right into their living rooms,” said Alain Tascan, President of Games at Netflix. “We want to bring football back to its roots with something&nbsp;<i>everyone</i> can play with just the touch of a button.”</p>
<p>The game, if you believe the press release from Netflix, will let you “experience the emotion and drama of the tournament in its purest, most joyful form, &nbsp;in a format that’s fast to learn, thrilling to master, and built for anyone to jump in.”</p>

<p>You will be able to play solo or online, “All you need is Netflix and your phone.”</p>

			<p>The Game Awards 2025 might've received <a href="https://x.com/geoffkeighley/status/1999330579041730881">a 'D' grade from viewers who voted in the poll</a> that the show's host and creator, Geoff Keighley, puts up on X (formerly Twitter) every year, but that didn't get people to turn away from the show. Keighley and his Game Awards team have, as they do every year, reported the viewership numbers from this year's show. Just like last year, it's another record-breaking year.</p>



<p>The Game Awards 2025 was the most-watched Game Awards ever, with 171 million livestreams of the entire show across the globe. Viewership was up 11% compared to last year, conversation about the show on X (formerly Twitter) was up 12% compared to last year, and there were 23,000 co-streams of the show across Twitch and YouTube, which is more than a 50% increase compared to last year.</p>



<p>And all of that doesn't even include the viewership numbers from Amazon Prime Video, <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-game-awards-will-stream-on-amazon-prime-video-for-first-time/">as the show made its Prime Video debut this year</a> as one of the streamer's live events. </p>

<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Thank you for making 2025 the most-watched <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/TheGameAwards?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#TheGameAwards</a> ever.</p><p>📈 Viewership up 11% YoY<br>🌍 171M+ global livestreams of the full show<br>💬 Conversation on X up 12% YoY<br>🎥 23,000 co-streams on Twitch &amp; YouTube (+50% YoY) <a href="https://t.co/8ZL95TIsPS">pic.twitter.com/8ZL95TIsPS</a></p></div>— The Game Awards (@thegameawards) <a href="https://twitter.com/thegameawards/status/2001382103880249581?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 17, 2025</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>The show is undeniably the biggest event of the year within the video games industry, even if it's not the most impactful to the industry, and it has continuously grown exponentially for years now. It's a credit to Keighley and his team that they are able to improve on the show's viewership and reach every year, even if the content of the show itself fluctuates far more than anyone would like to see.</p>

              <p><span>Jonathan Bailey, the actor who plays </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/wicked-for-good-scarecrow-fiyero-jonathan-bailey-reaction-2000646940"><span>Fiyero in the </span><i><span>Wicked </span></i><span>movies</span></a><span> and was </span><i><span>People</span></i><span>’s </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/jonathan-bailey-sexiest-man-alive-people-final-fantasy-2000641145"><span>Sexiest Man Alive</span></a><span> for 2025, also voices a cat boy in </span><i><span>Final Fantasy XIV </span></i><span>named G’raha Tia. Bailey has really blown up in the years since he took on the role in Square Enix’s MMO, with featured roles in both </span><i><span>Wicked: For Good </span></i><span>and </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/jurassic-world-rebirth-review-is-it-good-reboot-jp-film-1851785757"><i><span>Jurassic World: Rebirth</span></i></a><span> helping to make him the </span><a href="https://variety.com/2025/film/columns/jonathan-bailey-top-grossing-actor-wicked-jurassic-world-1236610431/"><span>top-grossing actor</span></a><span> of 2025. But even as Bailey has become a household name, G’raha Tia has remained a major character in </span><i><span>FFXIV</span></i><span>. Now, the MMO has released its 7.4 update, and based on the way Fiyero’s voice sounds, fans are unsure if Bailey is still hopping into the booth for Square Enix.</span></p> <p><span>The </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/1pnzopb/is_it_just_me_or_does_graha_tia/"><span>theories</span></a><span> about why G’raha sounds a little different this patch range from Bailey maybe being sick during his recording sessions, to him </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/1pnzr6b/jonathan_bailey_in_74/"><span>having used a subpar mic</span></a><span>, to him having been recast due to scheduling issues as he’s busy promoting </span><i><span>Wicked: For Good </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Jurassic World</span></i><span>. However, neither Square Enix nor Bailey has said anything about the actor dropping the role. If you listen to some of the comparisons between the new material and the character’s previously existing dialogue, the difference can sound subtle. Still, it’s enough that I can hear why someone who has been listening to this character for years might think he sounds different. We’ve reached out to Square Enix and Bailey for comment on the situation, and will update the story if we hear back.</span></p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">So I did a quick little comparison between 7.0 and 7.4 G'raha Tia, it seems that he HAS NOT been recast, I just think he's recording his lines from his phone or a subpar mic setup, the EQ is sorta way more treble-y, when his voice is usually bassy with the studio mics they use. <a href="https://t.co/AYYZYadgWU">pic.twitter.com/AYYZYadgWU</a></p> <p>— Josefumi 🎙️ (@JosefumiVO) <a href="https://twitter.com/JosefumiVO/status/2000983922734457059?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 16, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">NO ONE TALK TO ME IM CURRENTLY IN MOURNING ROGHT NOW <a href="https://t.co/feYKV6ssvr">pic.twitter.com/feYKV6ssvr</a></p> <p>— 🦦 (@gothgirlswag) <a href="https://twitter.com/gothgirlswag/status/2000990491610112012?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 16, 2025</a></p></blockquote>   <p><span>Bailey has been pretty open about how much he enjoys the role. Here’s a clip of him talking about how he had to record his </span><i><span>Final Fantasy XIV</span></i><span> lines in between shows while he was performing in the revival of </span><i><span>Company</span></i><span> from 2018 to 2019.</span></p>   <p><span>If Bailey was recast for the patch, hopefully it’s just a temporary measure until he’s done promoting </span><i><span>Wicked </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Jurassic Park</span></i><span>…and doing sexy photoshoots for the cover of </span><i><span>People</span></i><span>.</span></p>

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/forza-horizon-6-is-coming-to-pc-xbox-consoles-in-2026/">At Tokyo Game Show 2025</a>, Playground Games and Turn10 announced its next installment in its series of Forza games with Forza Horizon 6, which will be set in Japan and will arrive on Xbox Series X/S, PS5, and PC sometime in 2026. Now that we know what the studios have lined up next, they confirmed the inevitable, though still disappointing news for players, that Forza Motorsport will no longer receive new content updates.</p>



<p>The news was buried in <a href="https://forza.net/news/forza-year-in-review-2025">a lengthy blog post on the official Forza website</a>, which provided a recap for the year with some community highlights and a look back at what was added to Forza Horizon 5 and Forza Motorsport.</p>



<p>Shifting to focus on Forza Horizon 6's development was the reason cited by the studios, writing, "<em>As our team shifts its focus toward delivering the best possible experience with Forza Horizon 6 in 2026, we do not plan to introduce new cars, tracks, features, or regular bug fixes for Forza Motorsport.</em>"</p>



<p>"<em>However, we will continue supporting the game by keeping online servers active, hosting special events and competitions, and reintroducing previously released Featured Tours and reward cars on a monthly basis, until all content is available for you to enjoy anytime</em>."</p>



<p>At least players can still look forward to competitions in the new year and will get the chance to grab reward cars they may have missed the first time they came around. Forza Motorsport has always offered more of a simulation-based experience compared to a slightly more arcade-y feel in Forza Horizon, so it's good to know that servers and in-game events aren't going away for the foreseeable future.</p>



<p>In the meantime, Turn10 and Playground Games have to try and ensure they live up to the expectations players have for Forza Horizon 6 <a href="https://wccftech.com/forza-horizon-6-blow-away-fans-open-world-japan/">and the expectations they're setting for themselves</a>. According to a recent rumour, we'll be able to see if Forza Horizon 6 hits its mark <a href="https://wccftech.com/forza-horizon-6-targeting-h1-2026-launch-window-says-insider/">when it arrives sometime in the first half of 2026</a>.</p>

In addition, 1.6 million units of hardware were sold in the US in November, which is “the lowest total for a November month since 1995 (1.4 million).”</p><p>The rising costs of consoles probably didn’t help. The PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series of consoles both turned five in November, but customers looking to pick up one of the consoles brand new are having to grapple with higher prices following <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/762410/sony-ps5-price-hike-raise-digital-pro">price</a> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/782079/microsoft-xbox-console-price-increase-us">hikes</a> this year. Those hikes have led to an “all-time November high” for the average price paid for a new unit of video game hardware of $439, Circana says — a number that’s up 11 percent from 2024. (In November 2019, the average price was $235, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3ma6vnwvjmk2h">according to Circana analyst Mat Piscatella</a>.)</p><p>In November, the PlayStation 5 was the month’s best-selling hardware, “in both units and dollars,” which happened for the first time since the launch of the Nintendo Switch 2, according to Circana. The Switch 2 was 2nd in both units and dollars. The <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/844380/nex-playground-outselling-the-xbox">Nex Playground</a> was 3rd in terms of units sold, but the Xbox Series consoles ranked 3rd in dollars.</p><p><em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</em> was the best-selling game of the month, but the <em>Call of Duty</em> franchise experienced “a double-digit percentage full game dollar sales decline when compared to November 2024.” Activision announced <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/841290/activision-call-of-duty-modern-warefare-black-ops-back-to-back">last week</a> that it would be switching up its <em>Call of Duty</em> release strategy to not release <em>Modern Warfare</em> or <em>Black Ops</em> games back-to-back anymore.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTIz"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Jay Peters</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/846693/video-game-hardware-sales-november-2025-circana]]></content:encoded>

              <p>Every classic game deserves a wild Game Boy version. Roblox has to clean up its platform predator problem before it can get a Marvel collab. And a record-breaking Charizard sale has me thinking of every paper collectible I ever threw in the trash. Which presents am I currently buying my children that might one day be worth a small fortune? Or is the nostalgia-fueled millennial collectible market just another bubble everyone will forget about a decade from now?</p> <p>Welcome to the latest edition of Morning Checkpoint, <em>Kotaku</em>‘s daily roundup of gaming news and culture, which just broke its own record for the latest in the day it’s ever been published. Not quite as impressive as the Game Awards breaking its previous record for viewership with <a href="https://t.co/S6gFmiMa9w">over 170 million livestreams for this year’s show</a>, but who’s counting?</p>

 <h2>An incredible<em> Resident Evil</em> demake just resurfaced for the holidays</h2> <p>London-based studio HotGen’s journey to get a PS1 game playable on Game Boy Color was left incomplete, <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/a-98-complete-version-of-the-cancelled-game-boy-color-resident-evil-port-has-been-shared-online/"><em>VGC</em> reports</a>. But preservationists <em>Games That Weren’t</em> has now shared what appears to be an almost entirely playable build of the fascinating curio from the turn of the century.</p>

 <p>“[We’ve] now preserved a final version of [the] game at the point of cancellation and we have it here for you today to check out thanks to Pete Frith providing everything,” the group <a href="https://twitter.com/fgasking/status/2001216784850927920?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E2001216784850927920%7Ctwgr%5E8948a42e68905b40041ecb0f0d37a081003ca5cc%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fkotaku.com%2Fwp%2Fwp-admin%2Fpost-new.php">announced on X today</a>. “Again, it isn’t 100% complete (perhaps now 98% – based on Pete’s estimates) – but there is more content and it *might* actually now be completable. Due to time constraints, we’ve not been able to sit and play through the title fully to confirm, as there might be scenes that glitch/bug out – if you find that it is, please do let us know!”</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Our first big Christmas update is with an amazing recovery of the final build of Resident Evil on Gameboy Color. Hotgen's impressive conversion that got canned. This is much closer to completion, and seems completable too.

 <p>Meanwhile, a Roblox ban in countries like Russia has <a href="https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/russian-ban-roblox-gaming-platform-sparks-rare-protest-2025-12-14/">provoked a rare outburst of protest</a>. Players there recently held up signs saying “Hands off Roblox” and “Roblox is the victim of the digital Iron Curtain.” Pissing off gamers is basically the 2025 equivalent of invading Russia during the winter.</p>

 <h2>A mint-condition Charizard card just sold for half a million at auction</h2> <p>The PSA 10 First Edition Base Set Charizard went for $550,000 including the buyer’s premium <a href="https://comics.ha.com/heritage-auctions-press-releases-and-news/-550-000-psa-10-charizard-breaks-record-leads-all-time-high-5.27-million-total-at-heritage-trading-card-games-auction.s?releaseId=5371">at a recent Heritage auction</a>. It breaks the <a href="https://www.dicebreaker.com/games/pokemon-trading-card-game/news/charizard-holo-shadowless-pokemon-card-auctioned">previous record</a> of $420,000 set back in 2022, though it’s still a pittance compared to the $5 million an Illustrator Pikachu <a href="https://www.tcgplayer.com/content/article/The-20-Most-Expensive-Pok%C3%A9mon-Cards-Ever/4e15f8c9-b6eb-49c9-a5ee-3dc806693c3e/">once sold for</a>.</p>

You grab the IP because you believe the IP had something, but there’s no traces of the DNA of that IP in your game. That’s weird to me.”</p> <p>The new version includes co-op and a roguelike mode. It has less than 1,000 reviews on Steam and a middling rating of just 55 percent positive. “I didn’t play it,” Chmielarz said. “I played the beta when they had it, and I disagreed with every single thing they’ve done in it, and that’s it.”</p> <h2>Warner Bros. says no to Paramount</h2> <p>The company’s board of directors <a href="https://ir.wbd.com/news-and-events/financial-news/financial-news-details/2025/Warner-Bros--Discovery-Board-of-Directors-Unanimously-Recommends-Shareholders-Reject-Paramount-Tender-Offer/default.aspx">basically accused CEO David Ellison</a> of lying and saying he’s not good for the money. “Despite having been told repeatedly by WBD how important a full and unconditional financing commitment from the Ellison family was – and despite their own ample resources, as well as multiple assurances by PSKY during our strategic review process that such a commitment was forthcoming – the Ellison family has chosen not to backstop the PSKY offer,” it told investors.

            <title><![CDATA[First Fallout 5 Details Confirmed by Bethesda’s Todd Howard]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/bethesda-todd-howard-confirmed-fallout-5-details/</link>
            <guid>1386487</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Todd Howard, one of the head honchos at Bethesda Game Studios, has given up the first solid details we’ve ever gotten for Fallout 5. In a recent interview, the visionary developer confirmed that Fallout 5 <strong>will be impacted </strong>by the ongoing television series, which shares the same universe as the games.</p>



<p>It started with a Fallout 76 crossover, and it will eventually evolve into Fallout 5’s setting or story bleeding into what has happened, or is yet to happen, in the Prime-backed television show.</p>



<h2 id="h-huge-news-for-fallout-fans">Huge News for Fallout Fans</h2>



<p>In a recent interview with the BBC, Todd Howard sat down on his marketing spree to talk about the second season of Fallout, which debuted today. The second season is already proving to be a hit with fans and critics alike, scoring extremely well in early reviews.</p>



<p>The interview <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/cvgr488vlmmo" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">with the BBC</a> unveiled a juicy titbit that Fallout fans will go giddy over.</p>



<p>When asked if Fallout 5 will be impacted by the developing television series, Todd Howard simply said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>In short, yes.</p>



<p>Fallout 5 will be existing in a world where the stories and events of the show happened or are happening.</p>



<p>We are taking that into account.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>That means you’ll need to watch the television show unravel with a keener eye, as what happens in the series might serve as a nod to what’s <strong>going to happen </strong>in Fallout 5.</p>



<p>It stands to reason that Fallout 5 will be set further in the future than any other game to date. That’s currently an accolade bestowed upon Fallout 4, which is set in 2287, while the television series starts in 2296.</p>



<p>Fans have theorized that Fallout 5 could very well be set around 2300, following the events that are set to unravel in the next few episodes of the Fallout television show, <strong>and beyond</strong>.</p>



<p>This would push Fallout into uncharted territory. History is already written, and in some ways, Bethesda Game Studios going back to the origin of it all with Fallout 76, which is set in 2102, was an error, as it meant some elements of the series’ lore had to be retconned.</p>



<p>With Fallout 5 being (potentially) set after the television series, or even in a parallel timeline, Bethesda has the opportunity to unleash some creative freedom and really push the boat out.</p>



<p>But if we’re being honest, it will most likely be another five years <strong>at least </strong>before we get our hands on anything serviceable in the Fallout 5 stakes.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The Game Awards 2025 was a resounding success. In a post on social media, show organizer and host Geoff Keighly revealed that the 12th annual show was the most-watched The Game Awards in history.</p>



<p><a href="https://x.com/geoffkeighley/status/2001381987278581942" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Keighly revealed</a> that there were more than 171 million global livestreams of the full show. That’s an 11% year-over-year increase from the 151 million <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-game-awards-2024-most-watched-ever/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">livestreams in 2024</a>.</p>







<p>The total count only includes those who watched the full broadcast on the available platforms. It doesn’t include any shorts or clips on the various channels for The Game Awards, nor does it include any data from Prime Video.</p>



<p>Aside from Prime Video—which aired the show for the first time this year—The Game Awards 2025 was available on YouTube, Twitch, Steam, TikTok, Twitter, Kick, Facebook, and Instagram. As far as concurrent viewership goes, Streamcharts, per <a href="https://variety.com/2025/digital/news/game-awards-2025-viewing-record-livestreams-worldwide-1236611146/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Variety</a>, have the pek number at 4.4 million, which is also higher than 2024’s 4 million total.</p>



<p>There were even 23,000 co-streams of the show on YouTube and Twitch. That’s up 50% compared to last year’s event.</p>







<p>Whether you enjoyed the reveals and the overall awards presentation or not, there’s no denying just how well the show performed and a viewership level. The show was carried by a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-game-awards-2025-everything-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">number of major reveals</a>, including Star Wars: Fate of the Old Republic. As far as the Awards themselves, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gamescom-2025-awards-all-award-winners/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">won in nearly every category</a> it was nominated for. The game even broke the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-broke-all-time-the-game-awards-record/">record for the most wins</a> in The Game Awards history with nine awards.</p>

                <p>Earlier this year, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/silent-hill-f/" data-ref-id="5000-574203">Silent Hill f</a> became the first game in the series to ditch the small American town that the series was named for in favor of setting it in Japan decades earlier. That approach may be used again for future titles in the franchise, according to developer Motoi Okamoto.</p><p>"We believe we could perhaps take similar approaches with other cultures across the globe," Okamoto told <a href="https://www.inverse.com/gaming/silent-hill-interview-okamoto-konami-americas" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Inverse</a> through a translator. "For example, in Central or South America, we could perhaps tap into the more local, shamanistic beliefs and see how that ties in. But we could also try to expand our horizons and look into other regions, like possibly Russia, Italy, or South Korea, because all those areas have their own unique types of belief systems. I believe that will be a gateway for us to expand our concepts further."</p><p>Okamoto appears to have put the most thought into the Central and South American locations, which he said have "been affected by a lot of military governments and coups," before adding, "There is a type of bravado and 'machismo' that comes from these political landscapes. There’s also the more folkloric angle coming from shamanism and local beliefs."</p><p>However, Okamoto noted that Konami potentially partnering with a development studio in Central and South America for a Silent Hill game may be difficult because the region doesn't have many to choose from. But he didn't rule it out. </p><p>Okamoto recently <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/silent-hill-f-producer-explains-how-fan-art-and-memes-have-kept-it-trending/1100-6536592/" data-ref-id="1100-6536592">credited memes and fan art</a> for keeping Silent Hill f trending months after its release. An update for that game also <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/silent-hill-f-update-adds-new-casual-difficulty-skip-feature-for-new-game-plus/1100-6536180/" data-ref-id="1100-6536180">added a new casual difficulty</a> and a skip feature for new game plus. Meanwhile, the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/silent-hill-2/" data-ref-id="5000-574201">Silent Hill 2</a> remake appears to have been <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/silent-hill-2-remake-quietly-confirmed-for-xbox-series-x-s/1100-6536398/" data-ref-id="1100-6536398">quietly confirmed for Xbox Series X|S</a>.

<p>Let's play hide-and-seek!</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>If you're looking for a little bit of lightness this holiday season for you and the kids, then hopefully you've been saving up a bunch of those <strong>It's Me, Mario!</strong> shorts. Nintendo has been sharing these on its family-friendly <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@playnintendo">Play Nintendo YouTube Channel</a> since August 2025.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rkVH3EaHbL4">Episode 5</a> dropped overnight and features Mario with Yoshi and Toad, who are playing a simple game of hide-and-seek. Mario must find both of his friends, who have found devious places to keep themselves out of the plumber's eyesight.</p>
<p>And look, we're extremely partial to stop-motion animation, but Yoshi and Toad look particularly adorable; we love the little Super Mario World nod with the trees and the fruit, and Toad is... well, Toad! He can hide in some pretty easy places in the Mushroom Kingdom.</p>
<p>All five shorts have some lovely little callbacks to the Mario series as a whole, so while the kids might delight in the lovely colours and animations, parents (or grandparents, or uncles, aunts — whoever!) can get all nostalgic. You can see all five currently released episodes in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLngvvr1C2bLGRo0H8Lwl33utYqofaMDT3">this playlist</a>.</p>
<p>The It's Me, Mario! shorts are actually designed to promote the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/gallery-nintendo-updates-its-my-mario-product-line-with-multiple-new-yoshi-items-heres-a-look"><strong>My Mario</strong> range of toys for young children</a>, which were <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/gallery-nintendo-shows-off-its-new-my-mario-product-line">released in Japan back in August this year</a>. A selection of these are coming to the US in 2026.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-cold-snap-update-blueprint-drop-rate-2000654257</link>
            <guid>1386454</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Extraction shooter and recent Game Awards winner </span><i><span>Arc Raiders </span></i><span>just dropped a massive, winter-themed update. Cold Snap, as it’s called, adds a map condition that can cause frostbite, a timed event that lets players earn rewards (including Raider Tokens), a Candleberry Banquet project that also offers up some currency and cosmetics, and, apparently, way more generous </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-blueprint-locations-night-raid-map-2000650966"><span>blueprint drops</span></a><span>.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>A </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1pom4pm/keep_the_blueprint_drop_rate/"><span>popular post on the official </span><i><span>Arc Raiders </span></i><span>subreddit</span></a><span> titled “Keep the blueprint drop rate” argues for developer Embark Studios to make the alleged changes to said drop rate permanent. “</span><span>Instead of sitting on gear and going with free loadouts, this incentivizes players to use loadouts with safe pockets and get some skin in the game,” the post reads. “What this game needs is to better incentivize bold play.”&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>In </span><i><span>Arc Raiders</span></i><span>, you have the option to venture up to the dangerous surface with either a free loadout of random, low-tier loot that you won’t mind losing if you get jumped by another player or zapped by a Hornet, or a custom loadout that often includes a safe pocket, in which you can store one precious item in case you die aboveground or fail to extract. The benefit of the custom loadout is that you’re guaranteed to leave with </span><i><span>something</span></i><span>, so long as you put it in your safe pocket, but the downside is that you run the risk of losing an upgraded gun or a higher-quality shield.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>Many </span><i><span>Arc Raiders</span></i><span> players prefer to play conservatively, avoiding conflict with enemy squads at all costs. I can understand this, as I often run around the game with proximity chat on, yelling, “I’m doing a quest, please leave me alone!” But if there’s an elusive blueprint tucked away in my backpack, I can feel my trigger finger itching—this might mean that the next few weeks of </span><i><span>Arc Raiders</span></i><span> gameplay are more ruthless than ever before…</span></p>

 <p><span>I played a bit yesterday after the Cold Snap update and got three blueprints over the course of a few matches, which is definitely more than I’ve seen before. In one match, I was in a pure panic trying to get to an elevator with a shiny new gun, several stacks of Candleberries (which are found outside in the cold), and </span><i><span>two</span></i><span> blueprints, all while frostbite steadily depleted my health and a damn Wasp flitted overhead. I made it out, knuckles whiter than the layer of snow covering my backpack.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>When asked if the blueprint drop was adjusted, a spokesperson for </span><i><span>Arc Raiders</span></i><span> pointed me to two bullet points in the </span><a href="https://arcraiders.com/news/cold-snap-patch-notes"><span>most recent patch notes</span></a><span>:</span></p> <ul> <li aria-level="1"><span>Increased some item and blueprint spawn rates in Stella Montis.</span></li> <li aria-level="1"><span>Expanded blueprint spawn locations to improve availability in areas that were underrepresented.</span></li> </ul> <p><span>It’s not clear if this change is intended to be permanent, but of course Embark Studios may adjust the blueprint drop if it finds it’s become </span><i><span>too</span></i><span> easy to grab them. After all, avarice is a sin, and the greed on display by </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1po80ca/yeah_so_they_have_changed_the_blueprint_droprate/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button"><span>this player with 15 blueprints in their backpack </span></a><span>sickens me.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>For now, there are more blueprints out there. Go forth and be merry, Raiders. Please don’t shoot.&nbsp;</span></p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/everything-you-need-to-know-animal-crossing-kappn-update-switch-2-2000654252</link>
            <guid>1386451</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><i><span>Animal Crossing: New Horizons</span></i><span> hasn’t received a major update since 2021, and Nintendo previously showed no interest in continuing development on the five-year-old game. It was a huge surprise when Nintendo, in October, announced that </span><i><span>Animal Crossing: New Horizons </span></i><span>would get not only a Nintendo Switch 2 edition, but a 3.0 content update, too. On Oct. 30, Nintendo dropped </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/animal-crossing-new-horizons-switch-2-edition-update-free-2000640118"><span>a 12-minute video breaking down the new details</span></a><span> and gave press an early, hands-off look earlier in December.</span></p> <p><span>Nintendo previewed the update in a 25-minute demo </span><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/animal-crossing-new-horizons-30-first-impressions-of-the-switch-2-version"><span>covered by </span><i><span>IGN</span></i></a><span>, which said the update is largely focused on design and decor and Nintendo Switch 2 quality-of-life improvements. Here’s what we know so far.</span></p> <h2><strong>When’s it coming out?</strong></h2> <p><i><span>Animal Crossing: New Horizons</span></i><span>‘ 3.0 update and Nintendo Switch 2 edition will be released on Jan. 15, 2026. The Nintendo Switch 2 Edition costs $64.99 on its own, or $4.99 for people who already own the game on Nintendo Switch. All players will get the 3.0 update content for no additional cost.</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000654254" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000654254"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000654254">Image: Nintendo</figcaption></figure> <h2><strong>What’s new in the Switch 2 version?</strong></h2> <p><i><span>Animal Crossing: New Horizons</span></i><span> on the Nintendo Switch 2 will benefit from the console’s mouse controls, which will make placing decor a bit less fiddly. And that makes sense, paired with a content update that’s largely centered on decor. Using the Joy-Con 2s as a mouse makes clicking and dragging stuff around the map much simpler.</span></p>

 <p><span>IGN said the </span><i><span>Animal Crossing: New Horizons</span></i><span> Switch 2 edition also has an exclusive device—a megaphone. It’s used to call out to villagers and other visiting characters so they’re easier to find. To do so, you literally have to say a character’s name into the Switch 2 microphone, </span><a href="https://www.polygon.com/animal-crossing-new-horizons-updates-preview/"><span>according to </span><i><span>Polygon</span></i></a><span>. However, the megaphone can only be used for characters that are outside of buildings—ones that would actually “hear” you—so it isn’t as useful for anyone inside a structure, </span><i><span>IGN</span></i><span> said.</span></p>

 <p><span>One initial draw is the upgraded multiplayer; up to 12 people can congregate on an island. But </span><i><span>IGN</span></i><span> reported that this feature requires everyone to be on a Switch 2. Plus, the edition makes use of the new camera system to display a player’s face near their character.</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000654253" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000654253"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000654253">Image: Nintendo</figcaption></figure> <h2><strong>How about the 3.0 content update?</strong></h2> <p><span>The big addition in </span><i><span>Animal Crossing: New Horizons</span></i><span>‘ 3.0 update is the Kapp’n family’s hotel—your </span><i><span>Animal Crossing</span></i><span> island is now a destination not only for your friends, but visiting </span><i><span>Animal Crossing</span></i><span> characters. Leilani, Kapp’n’s wife, runs the hotel and gives you the opportunity to decorate up to 10 rooms, per </span><i><span>Polygon</span></i><span>. </span><i><span>IGN </span></i><span>said it’s something to be unlocked, but it’s tied to the pier—not optional or moveable. It’s similar to the </span><i><span>Happy Home Paradise</span></i><span> DLC, IGN said, in which you’ll decorate rooms, just by theme and not to a specific character’s interests.</span></p>

 <h3><span>Designing hotel rooms</span></h3> <p><i><span>IGN </span></i><span>said that you’ll be able to design around themes—like, say, seaside—but don’t have to. You’ll be able to choose from different items, but aren’t required to use anything in particular, unlike in </span><i><span>Happy Home Paradise</span></i><span>. You’ll have your full catalog of items to use, as well as items related to the specific theme.</span></p>

 <h3><span>Hotel shopping and new items</span></h3> <p><span>You earn hotel tickets by designing rooms, and then use the tickets to earn more things from a hotel-specific shop manned by Gran. </span><i><span>Polygon</span></i><span> said that a number of new items were left out of the preview, but that it’s a “very large amount of furniture.” There are new Nintendo-themed items, too, like the Ultra Hand and different NES games playable on classic consoles purchasable from the hotel lobby shop. (These need a Nintendo Switch Online subscription to play.)</span></p> <p><span>Other new items include </span><i><span>Splatoon</span></i><span>, </span><i><span>Lego</span></i><span>, and </span><i><span>The Legend of Zelda</span></i><span> stuff.</span></p> <h3><span>Crafting tweaks</span></h3> <p><span>One of the quality-of-life adjustments in the 3.0 content update is the ability to craft several items at once, using materials from storage instead of inside a player’s pockets, Nintendo announced during its October preview. Simply put, crafting could be a pain in the ass before; this should help, especially when you’ve got a lot to make.</span></p> <p><span>With so much new design and decor content, easing the pain of crafting a lot of stuff feels essential to the experience. Making things easier once again, there’s also a Resetti “reset” service to quickly clear a part of your island.</span></p> <h3><span>Slumber Island</span></h3> <p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/845242/animal-crossing-new-horizons-3-0-update-switch-2-edition-features"><i><span>The Verge</span></i></a><span> described the Slumber Island feature, seen in the December preview, as “extra sandboxes” to decorate and play in. You’ll be able to set the time of day and weather to create whatever vibe you’re into—without messing about on your permanent island. </span><i><span>The Verge</span></i><span> said it looked like a “quicker and smoother” way to dream up a design and build it all out: Items from your in-game catalog appear immediately, and terraforming has a little quality-of-life improvement, it seems, to help make the process less painful. Plus, Lloyd can build bridges and inclines immediately, according to </span><i><span>The Verge</span></i><span>. No waiting around.</span></p>

			<p>December might be home to Christmas, Boxing Day, and the rush to buy presents for loved ones for a significant portion of the world, but November is no slouch, particularly because of Black Friday. This year, however, November was not a booming and bustling month for game sales in the US, at least for physical game sales and hardware sales, according to the <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3ma6t4juhvs2w">latest Circana report from executive director Mat Piscatella</a>.</p>



<p>In fact, physical game sales and hardware sales were the lowest they've been in the US since November 1995, as total spending across video games, hardware, and accessories came in at $5.9 billion, a 4% drop compared to November 2024.</p>



<p>Hardware spending specifically dropped to $695 million, a 27% drop compared to last year. November 2025 is now the second-lowest spending total for video game hardware in the US since November 2005, when the total spend on hardware was $455 million.</p>



<p>The number of hardware units was also down to 1.6 million for the month, with the only lower unit total coming from November 1995, when 1.4 million hardware units were sold. When it comes to specific consoles, sales for <strong>Xbox Series X/S consoles are down 70%</strong> compared to November 2024. <strong>PlayStation 5 console sales were down 40%</strong>, while Nintendo Switch console sales were down 10%, and that's even including the fact that the Switch 2 is now available.</p>



<p>Spending on accessories also fell to $327 million, a 13% drop compared to November 2024, with spending on controllers specifically dropping 19% compared to last year. Content, which encapsulates actual video game sales, DLC, etc., was the only area that actually went up compared to November 2024, with a 1% growth overall.</p>



<p>That said, physical game sales were down 14% compared to last year, another "<em>all-time low for a November month since tracking began in 1995</em>," Piscatella wrote.</p>







<p>So, what happened to make video game spending drop so much with regard to hardware, accessories, and physical video game sales? Well, according to Piscatella in a statement given to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/video-game-physical-software-and-hardware-sales-just-had-the-worst-november-in-the-us-since-1995">IGN</a>, it's the fact that the cost of everything, including video games, has skyrocketed in recent years, <a href="https://wccftech.com/okay-dont-panic-but-hdd-prices-are-rising-faster-than-they-have-in-years/">and with rising RAM prices</a>, things don't look good for the future.</p>



<p>"<em>Retail spending had been holding up relatively well until now, despite the pressure from higher prices we've been seeing in the market. More affluent consumers have kept on spending so far, which has made up for some of the declines in spending from the less affluent portions of the market. Perhaps this is a sign that those higher prices are beginning to impact purchases of pricier items, like consoles. Perhaps not.</em></p>



<blockquote>
<p><em>However, if the crunch on RAM pricing continues, if we see rising prices on consoles and gaming PCs over the coming months it could, theoretically, be potentially devastating to the dedicated gaming device market. Which would, of course, have potential carryover effects on the content side. I certainly see some of the relationships between hardware unit sales and pricing we're seeing in the November results as a red flag.</em>"</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Earlier this year, <a href="https://wccftech.com/tariffs-rising-costs-us-consumers-spending-less-video-games/">Piscatella gave a presentation at Summer Game Fest</a>, where he outlined how the rising cost of essentials in the US would likely impact video game market sales, because consumers would simply have less money to spend on video games when they're worried about paying rent and buying food.</p>



<p>Now, as Piscatella points out, it's not just the rising price of essentials that people need to live on that is driving down video game spending, but the cost of the games and the hardware themselves. In November 2019, the average cost of a console was $239. Now, <a href="https://wccftech.com/ps5-ps5-pro-price-increases-us-tomorrow/">as console prices have risen</a>, not dropped, <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-series-x-s-prices-will-reportedly-go-up-again-in-us-microsoft/">since the new generation launched</a>, even for<a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-us-price-changes-nintendo-switch-2/"> what is now officially previous-gen consoles</a>, the average price for a console in the US is $439.  </p>



<p>It's still too early to tell if this is a one-off bad month or if this is the beginning of a growing trend. We won't know how the December 2025 numbers look until January 2026. That said, these numbers aren't exactly inspiring, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-is-now-rumored-to-reduce-the-production-of-rtx-50-gpus/">as memory shortages continue to turn the entire tech industry upside down</a>, it doesn't look like prices will stabilize anytime soon. Unless everyone starts getting paid more, the majority of consumers will continue to be priced out of buying the latest tech, in video games or elsewhere.</p>



<p>Lastly, an update on the best-selling games of 2025 in the US, a figure that we've been tracking most of the year. <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-pokemon-legends-z-a-tops-us-sales-charts-october-2025/">For October 2025, it was Battlefield 6 that stood at the top</a> of both the monthly charts and the year-to-date charts. </p>



<p>While Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 was the best-selling game in the US for November 2025, it doesn't even crack the top five for the year-to-date premium game sales charts, with Battlefield 6 still atop that list. Battlefield 6 was also the second-best-selling game for the month of November 2025, a clear sign that it has not slowed down its sales momentum in the US.</p>







<p>It's still early to call it, but perhaps Battlefield 6, not Call of Duty, will be the best-selling first-person shooter in the US at the end of 2025. We'll find out next year.</p>
