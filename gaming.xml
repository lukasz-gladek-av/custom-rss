            <p>The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom's stunning soundtrack is now available to buy as a custom CD boxset.</p>
<p>Comprising of over 300 tracks across nine CDs that run for 11 hours, <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/Legend-Zelda-Kingdom-Original-Soundtrack/dp/B0D2RZGSTS/">The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom Original Soundtrack</a> is set to release on 12th July (in the UK at least – other territories will vary) for a formidable £230.</p>

<p>"A total of 344 songs on 9 CDs, including songs from the game and songs used in trailers," explains the item description. "The total recording time is approximately 11 hours.</p>
<p>This edition includes "a three-sided luxury box with tall size digipak" and "a sword-shaped USB, which contains high-resolution and 5.1-channel sound sources, allowing you to experience the magnificent game world in greater depth and higher definition".</p>

<p>Each disc includes markings familiar to anyone who's spent time with the game, and comes in a hefty box to keep the CDs safe. However, the Master Sword USB that contains digital copies of the tracks is likely to be the main draw for most fans.</p>
<p>If you don't have a spare £200 hanging around, you can still enjoy the soundtrack on popular streaming services like <a href="https://open.spotify.com/playlist/6VQ05hTl7qZGLVuAv0PsRn?si=d69d98f05f024211">Spotify</a>.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-has-just-dropped-another-batch-of-brilliant-game-soundtracks-onto-spotify">Sony also recently added the soundtracks for games like Gravity Rush, Shadow of the Colossus, Wild Arms, and PoPoLoCrois</a> to Spotify and other streaming platforms, joining other free-to-stream OSTs for games like Bloodborne, Destiny, Elden Ring, Silent Hill, and Final Fantasy.</p>
<p>"For Breath of the Wild, Nintendo <a href="https://nintendoeverything.com/breath-of-the-wild-composers-on-changing-up-zeldas-music-formula-and-more/">lightened the soundtrack</a> even as it brushed away the heavily telegraphed optional activities that fill most open worlds, reducing the musical component to a troupe of travelling performers who seem as lost in this landscape as you are," Eurogamer contributor, Edwin, wrote in his fantastic feature, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/can-tears-of-the-kingdom-match-the-sly-genius-of-breath-of-the-wilds-music">Can Tears of the Kingdom match the sly genius of Breath of the Wild's music?</a></p>
<p>"Sometimes the piano feels like it's trying to play you, in multiple senses. It wants you to feel pleasantly lost in a world whose smiling desolation is always bringing you to a halt, mesmerised, even as every curve of the road throws up some gently magnetic object of interest. Other times, it sounds like it's reacting to your movements, swept along behind as you race for the next landmark, or knocked askew as you slide off the critical path to investigate a cracked rockface. One of the great surprises of Breath of the Wild, for me, was learning that while the soundtrack is layered and dynamic - it has escalating tiers of combat music, for instance - the piano isn't fully context-sensitive."</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/all-one-piece-manga-spinoffs-listed-and-explained.887244/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/all-one-piece-manga-spinoffs-listed-and-explained/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=all-one-piece-manga-spinoffs-listed-and-explained<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="294" data-injectable="true" data-video="true"><em>One Piece</em> has a number of spinoff mangas. These range from sharing Ace’s story to following Sanji as he cooks delectable meals for his friends. The stories provide windows into the lives of side characters while also providing various art styles starkly contrasting with the main series. </p> <p data-characters="113" data-current-count="113" data-injectable="false">Without much ado, here is an explanation of every <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/one-piece-chapter-1116-release-date-time-and-what-to-expect/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>One Piece</em> manga</a> spinoff, all of which can be found on <a href="https://www.viz.com/search?search=one+piece" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">VizMedia</a>.</p> <h2 id="h-ace-s-story" data-injectable="false">Ace’s Story</h2> <figure data-current-count="413" data-injectable="true"><p> <iframe title="Official Manga Trailer | One Piece: Ace’s Story—The Manga | VIZ" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kpaga_3BWfQ?feature=oembed&amp;enablejsapi=1&amp;origin=https://www.destructoid.com" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure>
 <p data-characters="308" data-current-count="308" data-injectable="false">Ace’s Story begins by following Ace on his pirating adventures before joining the White Beard Pirates. To avoid heavy spoilers, I won’t discuss the plot details or nuances. I will say that, as a fan of both Ace and <em>One Piece</em> as a whole, I thoroughly enjoyed this spinoff and highly recommend it. </p> <p data-characters="375" data-current-count="683" data-injectable="true">The art is drawn by Boichi. Many of you may be familiar with his work, as he also draws for <em>Dr. Stone</em>. This particular artist shines thanks to his attention to detail, showcased through his gorgeous and incredibly consistent panel work. Though very different from Eichiro Oda’s own art style, the mangaka’s style exceptionally highlights Ace’s personality. </p>
 <h2 data-injectable="false">Naoshi Komi Covers Vivi’s Adventure</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"></figure> <p data-characters="246" data-current-count="546" data-injectable="true">This particular one-shot is a redraw of a preexisting manga chapter. As the title states, Naoshi Komi covers Vivi’s adventure. Specifically, they cover chapter 216. For those unaware, Naoshi Komi is the artist for <em>Nisekoi</em>, a romance manga. </p>
 <p data-characters="298" data-current-count="298" data-injectable="false">Unlike Boichi’s art, which utilizes harsh lines to highlight details, Naoshi Komi’s recreation of <em>One Piece</em> utilizes smooth lines to create a soft mood. This spinoff doesn’t provide any new narrative or lore but rather allows you to relive a favorite moment in a different light. </p> <h2 data-injectable="false">Boichi Sensei covers the Zolo vs. Mihawk Battle</h2> <p data-characters="324" data-current-count="622" data-injectable="true">Similar to the previous entry, <em>Boichi Sensei covers the Zolo vs. Mihawk Battle</em> is a redrawing of a preexisting event in the original manga, again illustrated by Dr. Stone artist Boichi. The art is incredibly detailed and provides a vastly different reading experience compared to Eichiro Oda’s typical weekly entries. </p>
 <h2 data-injectable="false">Shokugeki no Sanji </h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><p> <iframe title="Official Manga Trailer | Shokugeki no Sanji | VIZ" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1AQ9HM4XYpM?feature=oembed&amp;enablejsapi=1&amp;origin=https://www.destructoid.com" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure> <p data-characters="293" data-current-count="593" data-injectable="true">Are there any Food Wars fans here? I have great news for you. Shun Saeki, the artist for Shokugeki no Soma, gives Sanji a new life. He creates incredibly fancy dishes, dazzling all those lucky enough to feast on his masterpieces. The narrative is set before Sanji joins the Straw Hat Pirates. </p>
 <p data-characters="92" data-current-count="92" data-injectable="false">The artist created it while participating in an event to promote and commemorate <em>One Piece</em>. </p> <h2 data-injectable="false">Monsters</h2> <p data-characters="333" data-current-count="425" data-injectable="true">To be honest, I might be stretching it a bit by calling <em>Monsters </em>a <em>One Piece</em> manga spinoff. In actuality, this is a one-shot Eichiro Oda made before <em>One Piece,</em> and it doesn’t make its relation to <em>One Piece </em>too obvious. However, most <em>One Piece</em> fans don’t realize the character in Monsters is referenced a number of times. </p>
 <p data-characters="292" data-current-count="292" data-injectable="false">The main character of Monsters has the same name as Ryoma, a legendary swordsman from <em>One Piece</em>. This is the skeleton Brook’s shadow takes over on Thriller Bark. According to <em>One Piece</em>, Ryoma is a samurai from Wano Kingdom who slays a dragon. In <em>Monsters</em>, he’s a wandering ronin. </p>

<p data-characters="134" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Almost all the <em>EA FC 24</em> TOTS players are now available in Ultimate Team, and there’s a massive collection of cards to pick from.</p> <p data-characters="353" data-current-count="353" data-injectable="false">The Team of the Season events introduced special cards from all five major European leagues. EA Sports also introduced the TOTS lineup from the women’s leagues, along with names from the rest of the world. The list of available choices has never been longer, which also makes it tricky to identify the best <em>EA FC 24</em> TOTS players for all positions.</p> <h2 id="h-best-ea-fc-24-tots-players-by-position" data-injectable="false">Best EA FC 24 TOTS players by position</h2> <p data-characters="277" data-current-count="630" data-injectable="true">Thanks to the vast number of TOTS cards released in <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/ea-fc-24-ultimate-team-felipe-anderson-end-of-an-era-sbc-solutions/">Ultimate Team</a>, every position is pretty well covered. EA Sports has also released TOTS Plus items, which make it easier for players to keep squad chemistry pretty high even if they’re using items from the Mixed Leagues.</p>
 <ul data-found-items="14" data-items-injection="true" data-current-count="560" data-injectable="true"> <li data-index="0">GK: Alisson, Gianluigi Donnarumma, Yann Sommer</li> <li data-index="1">RB: Jeremie Frimpong, Ona Batlle (SBC), Joao Cancelo, Dani Carvajal</li> <li data-index="2">LB: Alex Grimaldo, Theo Hernandez, Kai Havertz (SBC), Sakina Karchaoui</li> <li data-index="3">CB: Virgil Van Dijk, Sergio Ramos, Alessandro Bastoni</li> <li data-index="4">RWB: Jeremie Frimpong, Joao Cancelo, Ona Batlle (SBC)</li> <li data-index="5">LWB: Kai Havertz (SBC), Sakina Karchaoui, Selma Bacha, Theo Hernandez</li> <li data-index="6">CDM: Rodri, Declan Rice, Grace Geyoro</li> <li data-index="7">CM: Jude Bellingham, Zaire-Emery, Kevin De Bruyne, Luka Modric</li> <li data-index="8">CAM: Aitana Bonmati, Alex Putellas, Lionel Messi</li> <li data-index="9">RM: Ousmane Dembele, Caroline Hansen, Mohamed Salah</li> <li data-index="10">LM: Vinicius, Neymar, Salma Paralluelo</li> <li data-index="11">LW: Vinicius, Neymar, Kylian Mbappe</li> <li data-index="12">RW: Lionel Messi, Caroline Hansen, Lauren James</li> <li data-index="13">CF/ST: Erling Haaland, Kylian Mbappe, Antoine Griezmann, Cristiano Ronaldo</li> </ul>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"></figure> <p data-characters="326" data-current-count="626" data-injectable="true">Do note that some of the best <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/best-players-to-use-in-ea-fc-24-ultimate-tots-glow-up-evolution/"><em>EA FC 24</em> TOTS players</a> are available in packs as of writing. The Ultimate TOTS has reintroduced some of the best items, so it makes a lot of sense to open all your saved packs. You can also buy these items from the market, but most of them are pretty costly (despite the higher supply from packs).</p>
 <p data-characters="240" data-current-count="240" data-injectable="false">Additionally, new End of an Era and Flashback SBCs will be released every day during Ultimate TOTS. These cards have great stats, and the <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/ea-fc-24-ultimate-team-thiago-silva-end-of-an-era-sbc-tasks-solutions/">Thiago Silva EOAE item</a> is undoubtedly among the better defenders currently available in Ultimate Team.</p>

<p data-characters="297" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">The newest season of<em> Demon Slayer</em> follows the main cast of characters as they train to eventually fight against Mugen’s demons. Based on the manga, this season of the anime gives the characters life through animation while adding extra fluff for more character development and interactions. </p> <p data-characters="128" data-current-count="128" data-injectable="false">To help you follow along with each episode as it releases, here is the full <em>Demon Slayer Hashira Training Arc</em> release schedule. </p> <h2 id="h-demon-slayer-hashira-training-arc" data-injectable="false">Demon Slayer Hashira Training Arc</h2> <ul data-found-items="8" data-current-count="448" data-injectable="true"> <li>Episode 1 release date: May 12, 2024</li> <li>Episode 2 release date: May 19, 2024 </li> <li>Episode 3 release date: May 26, 2024</li> <li>Episode 4 release date: June 2, 2024 </li> <li>Episode 5 release date: June 9, 2024 </li> <li>Episode 6 release date: June 16, 2024</li> <li>Episode 7 release date: June 23, 2024</li> <li>Episode 8 release date: June 30, 2024 </li> </ul>

 <p data-characters="207" data-current-count="207" data-injectable="false">Ufotable, the animation studio responsible for Demon Slayer, always does consistent weekly releases.

This speculation is based on the length of the arc in the manga, which is only eight chapters long, making for roughly one episode per chapter. </p>
 <p data-characters="120" data-current-count="120" data-injectable="false">If they officially announce the number of episodes, expect this article to be updated with the appropriate information. </p>

  <p id="utJfhi">Happy June, Polygon readers. The weather is heating up, the sun is shining more brightly, and you’re probably doing activities outside a bit more. Good for you! But there’s still plenty of cause to plop on the couch, fire up the AC, pop some corn, and watch some great movies.</p>
<p id="vs336a">Every month, we collect the best movies new to streaming on Netflix, Hulu, Max, Prime, and more. This June, it’s a good group. We’ve got an underrated John Carpenter thriller newly on the Criterion Channel, two standout early works from directors with big releases this summer, and more.</p>
<p id="34KBgL">Here are the movies new to streaming services you should watch this month.</p>

<p id="TRcBF9"><strong>Where to watch:</strong> Criterion Channel<br><strong>Genre: </strong>Action thriller<br><strong>Director: </strong>John Carpenter<br><strong>Cast: </strong>Austin Stoker, Darwin Joston, Laurie Zimmer</p>
<p id="Kdvbem">Often imitated but never outdone, John Carpenter’s 1976 crime thriller is one of the tensest 91 minutes ever put on screen, and now it’s on the Criterion Channel as a part of its “Synth Soundtracks” collection. Carpenter’s second feature film (following <em>Dark Star</em>, and just two years before <em>Halloween </em>changed everything), the movie follows a police officer (Austin Stoker) and a convicted murderer (Darwin Joston) who team up to defend the titular precinct from a heavily armed street gang.</p>
<p id="bfVPUU">Made on a shoestring budget of approximately $100,000, the original <em>Assault on Precinct 13 </em>is a master class of efficient filmmaking, using the closed-in setting of the movie to maximum effect in building tension and staging action sequences. It’s also an early peek at many of the skills that would make Carpenter one of the great masters of genre filmmaking. —<em>Pete Volk</em></p>

<p id="GdXYpc"><strong>Genre: </strong>Dramedy<br><strong>Director: </strong>Sean Baker<br><strong>Cast: </strong>Kitana Kiki Rodriguez, Mya Taylor, James Ransone</p>
<p id="NMn6bX">Director Sean Baker just became the first American to <a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/05/25/nx-s1-4981452/anora-wins-palme-dor-cannes-film-festival">win the Palme d’Or</a> since Terrence Malick won for <em>The Tree of Life </em>in 2011. Baker’s new movie, <em>Anora</em>, follows a sex worker (Mikey Madison) in a difficult relationship with a Russian oligarch. It does not yet have a release date in the U.S., but that big award win is a great reason to revisit one of Baker’s early projects, <em>Tangerine —</em> another story about sex workers, but in a very different style.</p>
<p id="UB1su5">Shot on three iPhone 5S phones, <em>Tangerine </em>follows two trans sex workers in Los Angeles who are the closest of friends. One just got out of a short stint in prison and has heard her boyfriend has been cheating on her. The two try to find him and get down to the bottom of this mystery in a raw and funny dramedy that looks gorgeous despite the technological limitations of the equipment. If you liked Baker’s later films — <em>The Florida Project </em>and <em>Red Rocket —</em> or are looking forward to the Palme d’Or-winning <em>Anora</em>, but haven’t made time for <em>Tangerine</em>, now’s your moment. —<em>PV</em></p>

<p id="1TaQ12"><strong>Genre: </strong>Romantic comedy<br><strong>Director: </strong>Mike Nichols<br><strong>Cast: </strong>Sigourney Weaver, Harrison Ford, Melanie Griffith</p>
<p id="FikyIN">Mike Nichols’ (<em>The Graduate</em>)<em> </em>1988 rom-com classic was nominated for six Academy Awards, including Best Picture, Best Director, and acting nominations for Melanie Griffith, Sigourney Weaver, and Joan Cusack. A class comedy about a secretary who fills in for her injured boss only to have said boss try to take credit for her hard work, this is a breezy comedy with an outstanding cast that also serves as a bit of a time capsule for late 1980s New York City, and makes an excellent companion piece to <em>9 to 5</em>.</p>
<p id="kUK17p"><em>Working Girl</em> also inspired a particularly funny episode of <em>Bob’s Burgers</em>: the season 5 premiere “Work Hard or Die Trying, Girl,” a mashup of <em>Working Girl </em>and <em>Die Hard</em>. —<em>PV</em></p>

<p id="KSnzFi"><strong>Genre: </strong>Drama<br><strong>Director:</strong> Lee Isaac Chung<br><strong>Cast:</strong> Steven Yeun, Han Ye-ri, Alan Kim</p>
<p id="NNGE2J">Lee Isaac Chung’s <em>Minari</em> is an American story in the purest sense: Jacob (Steven Yeun), a Korean American father with dreams of a better life for himself and his children, moves his family from California to Arkansas in pursuit of his dream of becoming a farmer. As they weather the challenges and hardships that come with this strange new life in the Ozarks, he and his family learn the true meaning of what it takes to build a home. From our list of the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/21538912/best-movies-2020">best movies of 2020</a>: </p>
<blockquote><p id="LTneWs">Novelistic and warmly rendered, Minari is a drama about everyday life, and remembering to see the gifts of what’s right in front of you. And the perspective comes from a top-tier cast: Along with Yeun, playing a piercing patriarch, Han Yeri delivers a touching performance as a mother holding fast to her wayward loved ones, newcomers Noel Cho and Alan S. Kim buck every bad trope to play goofy and lovable kids, and renowned Korean actress Yuh-Jung Youn solidifies her legacy in a film that is wholly American.</p></blockquote>

<p id="wkoA5L"><strong>Genre: </strong>Documentary<br><strong>Director: </strong>Godfrey Reggio</p>
<p id="JeuyQe">Consisting primarily of time-lapsed footage of cities and natural environments, <em>Koyaanisqatsi</em> is a fascinating time capsule of 20th-century society on the verge of the new millennium, one which asks its audiences to consider the symbiotic relationship between human beings and Earth and whether or not, as the English translation of the film’s title suggests, life as we know it has been thrown out of balance.</p>
<p id="VPY1to">The movie has gone on to be referenced and parodied countless times since its premiere in 1982, including in the 2007 announcement trailer for <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M80K51DosFo"><em>Grand Theft Auto 4</em></a>, which features a track from Philip Glass’ iconic score for the film. Make the time to appreciate this monolith of majestic introspective filmmaking. <em>—TE </em></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/a-new-player-foray-into-destiny-2-preparing-for-final-shape/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=a-new-player-foray-into-destiny-2-preparing-for-final-shape<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="265" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">As someone with more than 1,500 hours across the <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-borderlands-3/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Borderlands</a></em> games and 150 hours in <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-remnant-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Remnant 2</a></em>, you’d think I would have tried one of the biggest looter-shooters out there: <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/tag/destiny-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Destiny 2</a></em>. For one reason or another, it just hadn’t made its way into my gaming library.</p> <p data-characters="506" data-current-count="506" data-injectable="true">That changed when I befriended Chris, who had a long history with <em>Destiny </em>and <em>Destiny 2</em>. It turned out that Bungie had recently added a system allowing new players to skip past the early stages and jump straight to the endgame. Before I knew it, I was downloading 114 GB of looter-shooter madness amidst promises that “it won’t be that bad.” I created a human Warlock and was able to quickly claim gear that got me to 1810 Power. I didn’t know what the numbers meant, but 1810 felt pretty high.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <h2 id="h-the-good" data-injectable="false">The good</h2> <p data-characters="355" data-current-count="655" data-injectable="true">The best part about <em>Destiny 2</em> for me was the gunplay. Every gun feels incredibly satisfying to shoot. Whether it’s a close-range shotgun, a precise sniper rifle, or an explosive rocket launcher, every weapon looks unique and sounds great. There’s just something special about hearing the Arbalest’s signature hollow <em>plink</em> as you land a headshot.</p>
 <p data-characters="484" data-current-count="484" data-injectable="true">I also liked the variety of skills at my disposal. I only have one character – a Warlock – but within that class, I can choose to specialize in an element of my choice. Even within the element, I can further customize my grenade, melee ability, and super ability. I haven’t done much build-crafting in Destiny 2, but the ability descriptions are easy to understand, and with some guidance from Chris, I was able to create a Solar Warlock that felt both comfortable and powerful.</p>
 <p data-characters="124" data-current-count="124" data-injectable="false">All in all, it was surprisingly easy for me to just jump into <em>Destiny 2</em> as a brand-new player and start having a great time.</p> <h2 id="h-the-bad" data-injectable="false">The bad</h2> <p data-characters="575" data-current-count="699" data-injectable="true">One thing I didn’t expect from <em>Destiny 2</em> was the prevalence of jumping puzzles. I expressed that I like sniper rifles, so Chris led me on a mission to go get one. We embarked on a quest to obtain the Whisper of the Worm. Much of the quest involves a series of convoluted jumping puzzles in a dark environment with little room for error. I’m not good at platforming to begin with, and I still hadn’t gotten a good sense of the Warlock’s floating jump ability. I admit feeling pretty frustrated by the end of that dungeon, and I’m not sure if the sniper was worth it.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="456" data-current-count="756" data-injectable="true">I also found it difficult to navigate menus. I can look at some of my quests by pulling out my Ghost, but I need to look at my actual quests list in a different menu for a more in-depth view. There are also other objectives I need to accomplish in order to increase my Guardian Rank, but I can only view those from the Journey tab in my character menu. There were times when Chris had to guide me through the exact buttons to press to reach a certain menu.</p>
 <h2 id="h-a-crash-course-in-destiny-lore" data-injectable="false">A crash course in Destiny lore</h2> <p data-characters="342" data-current-count="342" data-injectable="false">One of the first things we did was play through the story campaigns. Going in, I didn’t know anything about <em>Destiny 2’s</em> lore. I still don’t. Chris did his best to fill me in on a decade’s worth of <em>Destiny</em> lore, but it was like trying to explain the history of Middle-earth to someone while watching the second <em>Lord of the Rings </em>movie.</p> <p data-characters="359" data-current-count="701" data-injectable="true">This also meant that intense emotional beats just didn’t hit for me. I watched a cutscene where some kind of robot met his end at the hands of a mysterious dark stranger. I didn’t know who these characters were or why they were here, but I was clearly meant to feel sad. Chris had to rapidly fill me in on who Cayde-6 was and why his death was important. </p>
 <p data-characters="294" data-current-count="294" data-injectable="false">Then, soon after I saw Cayde get murdered, I met Crow. Cayde’s murderer is on our side now, I guess? He became a Guardian? I didn’t know these characters well enough to feel anything but mild confusion. And now, just before The Final Shape expansion, we find out that <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/destiny-2-the-final-shape-launch-trailer-has-me-asking-a-lot-of-questions/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cayde is alive?</a> Maybe?</p> <figure data-current-count="594" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="360" data-current-count="360" data-injectable="false">Still, I was impressed by the quality of the cutscenes and how fun the campaigns were. We ran through the Lightfall campaign fairly quickly, with Chris hastily explaining who the Witness is, what’s going on with the Traveler, and what we were trying to accomplish. We defeated Calus on the fourth attempt, teabagged his corpse, and logged off for the night. </p> <figure data-current-count="660" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="194" data-current-count="194" data-injectable="false">I still don’t know what the Veil is, why Calus was after it, or why we went to Neptune. I’m to understand much of the player base was just as confused when playing through Lightfall.</p> <h2 id="h-a-full-fireteam" data-injectable="false">A full fireteam</h2> <p data-characters="367" data-current-count="561" data-injectable="true">It turns out that <em>Destiny 2</em> co-op is best enjoyed in teams of three. To that end, Chris invited me to play with his longtime friend Kyle. I voiced some worry that my inexperience would be a detriment to the team, but Kyle assured me that it would be fine. Not just because he was kind and welcoming (he was!), but because he could just hard carry us through anything.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="243" data-current-count="543" data-injectable="true">Kyle routinely got more kills than Chris and I combined. Chris insists there’s something wrong with how kills were counted. All I know is there were lots of explosions with Kyle at the center of them, surrounded by glowing green Threadlings.</p>
 <h2 id="h-why-didn-t-i-try-this-before" data-injectable="false">Why didn’t I try this before?</h2> <p data-characters="540" data-current-count="540" data-injectable="true">I think <em>Destiny 2’s </em>biggest deterrent was just how much game there was. I saw my friends and family enjoying their Destiny 2 adventures, but it always felt too late for me to join. Of course, the feeling only grew worse over the years. Destiny 2 was released as a live service in 2017, so there’s now seven years’ worth of content to catch up on. Or four, if you don’t count the content that’s no longer accessible. What’s left is a patchwork of confusing narratives and a game that assumes you already know how to play.</p>
 <p data-characters="293" data-current-count="293" data-injectable="false">I’m glad that Bungie added a way for new players to jump straight into the endgame, and I’m grateful to Chris for guiding me through the early stages. We’re now counting down the days to <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/destiny-2-the-final-shapes-patch-notes-are-so-big-that-bungies-splitting-them-across-three-previews/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Final Shape</a>. Even as a relative newbie, I’m excited to see what <em>Destiny 2</em> has in store for me.</p>

<p data-characters="384" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">After numerous bigger than life adventures, <em>Edens Zero </em>draws close to its inevitable conclusion. In a couple more chapters, Shiki Granbell will have accomplished his monumental task — making the end of an era for fans of the series. As to avoid spoilers, I’ll leave out direct story elements from this article. Here is everything to know regarding <em>Edens Zero</em> chapter 290. </p> <h2 id="h-when-does-edens-zero-chapter-290-come-out" data-injectable="false">When does Edens Zero chapter 290 come out? </h2> <p data-characters="307" data-current-count="307" data-injectable="false">According to <em><a href="https://kmanga.kodansha.com/title/10004/episode/351989" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Weekly Shonen Magazine</a></em>, <em>Edens Zero</em> chapter 290 releases June 4, 2024. As a part of Weekly Shonen Magazine, Eden Zero’s new chapter release date is the day a new magazine issue drops. The speculated release time is 8 am PST, a time based on the upload of the chapter in the previous week. </p> <p data-characters="216" data-current-count="523" data-injectable="true">Weekly Shonen Magazine releases every <strong>Wednesday</strong> in Japan, which is every Tuesday in the US. Therefore, the Edens Zero chapter 290 release date is on June 4, assuming there are no complications that delay the release.</p>
 <p data-characters="234" data-current-count="234" data-injectable="false">For those wanting to read it for free, you can check in on the <a href="https://kmanga.kodansha.com/title/10004/episode/351989" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">kmanga’s official site</a> on <strong>June 9, 2024</strong>. This is five days after its initial release. You can also read it as part of volume set 29, which releases on <strong>June 25, 2024</strong>. </p> <h2 data-injectable="false">What to expect</h2> <p data-characters="323" data-current-count="557" data-injectable="true">Hiro Mashima, the creator of <em>Edens Zero</em>, has begun wrapping up loose ends for the series. Rather than prolonging the series’ life, like how he did with <em>Fairy Tail</em>, Mashima is approaching <em>Edens Zero </em>closer to how he approached <em>Rave Master</em>. In essence, he’s going for a concise story rather than a drawn-out one. </p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><div> <blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">EDENS ZERO manga will end in 5 more chapters, in Shonen Magazine issue 29</p>— Shonen Magazine News (@WSM_manga) <a href="https://twitter.com/WSM_manga/status/1791754821415965022?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 18, 2024</a></blockquote> </div></figure> <p data-characters="322" data-current-count="622" data-injectable="false">Even after <em>Edens Zero</em> ends, fans will likely see many of the characters again in the near future. Hiro Mashima has a tendency to recycle character designs and concepts in his future series. Therefore, although we will soon have to say goodbye to the series, we may not have to say bid our farewells to all the characters. </p>

<p data-characters="231" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">If you’ve been keeping up with the packed schedule of events in <em>Final Fantasy XIV</em> in the lead up to <em>Dawntrail</em>, you’ll be expecting the <em>Dragon Quest</em> collaboration event, Breaking Brick Mountains, as it’s returning on June 5.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="210" data-current-count="210" data-injectable="false">With <em>Dawntrail </em>just around the corner, there are a lot of things happening in Eorzea to keep <em>Final Fantasy XIV </em>players occupied while they wait impatiently for the doomed summer holiday they’ve been promised.</p> <figure data-current-count="510" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Square Enix</figcaption></figure>

Regardless of whether you join in or not, be prepared to see a large number of wobbly slime hats.</p>

It's claimed Private Division has completely backed out of projects with Ghostrunner developer One More Level and Silent Hill 2 Remake developer, Bloober Team, with "almost all the staff" at the indie label laid off in April. Insiders say Take-Two is now looking to sell Private Division completely, possibly to a private equity firm.</p>
<p>Staff that remain at the label seemingly blame both Take-Two bosses and Private Division head Michael Worosz for "unreasonable sales targets, and pressured to release games before they were ready, with Kerbal Space Program 2 being a notable recent example".</p>
<p>"The people at Private Division were amazing, talented, passionate individuals who loved what they did and also really cared about each other as a team and as people," said one source. "We loved our projects, we worked hard, and we fostered a great environment internally. I would love to work with any of them again.</p>
<p>"The pain point was always Take-Two and associated leadership forcing our hand. The whole layoff situation proved what we already felt. Take-Two could not care less about its employees."</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/take-two-confirms-layoffs-reported-to-affect-private-division-and-more">It follows a round of Private Division layoffs in March 2023</a>, which – at the time – leadership called "necessary steps" as the company sought to "position [itself] for another extended period success".</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games-industry-layoffs-surpass-10000-for-2024-so-far">More than 10,000 people have been laid off from their jobs this year</a> across the video game industry so far.That's according to an <a href="https://publish.obsidian.md/vg-layoffs/Archive/2024">archive tallying layoffs across the industry</a>, which has now hit an estimated total of 10,100 people.</p>
<p>For comparison, 10,500 people were laid off in 2023, meaning almost as many have been impacted so far in 2024 in less than half the time.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/pokemon-go-guide/24168766/raid-schedule-legendary-mega-shadow-five-star<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="wh4fv5">If you’re preserving your raid passes (remote or otherwise) in<em> </em><a href="https://www.polygon.com/pokemon-go-guide"><em>Pokémon Go</em></a>, you’ll want to know who the big targets in raids will be for the month by using a <strong>raid schedule</strong>.</p>
<p id="VTZHXW">The <strong>raid targets</strong> swap out every 10 days approximately, so you’ll definitely want to keep track on who is coming next.</p>
<p id="DTQaCj">Raid eggs spawn in gyms every day from 10 a.m. until 10 p.m. in your local time. After the timer ticks down, a raid target will appear. You can check the difficulty of a raid while it’s still a egg; five-star raids have five little monster icons, Mega raids have the Mega DNA-like swirl, and shadow raids are at gyms taken over by Team Go Rocket.</p>
<p id="3S04E6">Below, we list all the high-value raid targets (Legendary Pokémon, Mega Pokémon, and shadow Legendary Pokémon) in<em> Pokémon Go </em>for June 2024.</p>
<hr id="s6zLpX">

<p id="S4G7FH">The raid schedules are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li id="AsAGOu">
<strong>June 1-10</strong>: Zapdos</li>
<li id="fuFxsu">
<strong>June 10-19</strong>: Landorus (Incarnate Forme)</li>
<li id="nemtha">
<strong>June 19-28</strong>: Yveltal</li>
<li id="xsgAel">
<strong>June 28 until July 8</strong>: Ho-Oh</li>
</ul>
<p id="EidMhR">All of these have a chance to be shiny. Remember that any Poké Ball you hit a shiny Legendary with is a guaranteed catch, so make sure to use a Pinap Berry to get some extra candy.</p>
<p id="aGJWUP">June 2024 will specifically have an <strong>Elite Raid day to focus on Mega Rayquaza on June 29</strong>, but not too much information is known about it as of writing this.</p>
<hr id="11E2yK">
<h2 id="JGcAes"><strong>Pokémon Go Mega raid schedule for June 2024</strong></h2>
<p id="jB1Otk">If you want to nab Mega energy, you can participate in Mega raids. As a reminder, you will get an amount of Mega energy based on how fast you take down the raid and you’ll get an opportunity to catch the featured Pokémon after completing it.</p>
<p id="2RpMEh">The raid schedule for Megas is as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li id="Xn2ViY">
<strong>June 1-10</strong>: Mega Gyarados</li>
<li id="O23OIq">
<strong>June 10-19</strong>: Mega Alakazam</li>
<li id="P2VLm9">
<strong>June 19-28</strong>: Mega Charizard Y</li>
<li id="lTrLiB">
<strong>June 28 until July 8</strong>: Mega Tyranitar</li>
</ul>
<p id="edTch4">All of these can also be shiny!</p>
<hr id="Le9HJb">
<h2 id="lJpupX"><strong>Pokémon Go Legendary Shadow raid schedule for June 2024</strong></h2>
<p id="ruKzmg">The focus of <strong>shadow raids</strong> this month will be <strong>Raikou</strong>. Note shadow raids will only appear during the weekends.</p>
<p id="YrX9Qa">As usual, you should make sure to team up for shadow raids, as they are quite a bit harder to complete. After completing the raid, the Pokémon will also be harder to catch, as they’ll move around much more often. Keep cool and be patient as you chuck out your balls to catch the shadow Legendary.</p>

<p>Despite the growing popularity of the genre, there’s nothing quite like Escape From Tarkov in the extraction shooter scene. It’s one of the most complex and realistic FPS experiences on the market, and many of us can’t wait for more. Here is everything new coming to Escape From Tarkov in 2024…so far!</p>



<h2 id="h-everything-included-in-the-escape-from-tarkov-roadmap-for-2024">Everything Included in the Escape From Tarkov Roadmap for 2024</h2>

<p>As of right now, Escape From Tarkov is about to have a monumental summer. Personally, I can’t wait for the next map, quality-of-life improvements, new weapons to play around with, and the hideout expansion. I just want more content overall, as someone who has played regularly since 2017!</p>







<h2 id="h-how-often-does-escape-from-tarkov-wipe">How Often Does Escape From Tarkov Wipe?</h2>



<p>With so many unique changes on the table for Escape From Tarkov, one would expect countless wipes over the next few months, right? Unfortunately, or fortunately, depending on how you like to play, nope. On average, Tarkov wipes once every five months, give or take, so around two per year.</p>



<p>The next EFT wipe is currently planned for sometime in August, though we don’t know an exact date yet!</p>

<p>It’s a question as old as the game itself—a meme within the community. When is the next Escape From Tarkov wipe? Once you’ve unlocked all traders, completed your quests, and achieved Kappa, what then? It’s time to look toward the future. Here is what we know about the next EFT wipe and how to make the most of wipe day!</p>



<h2 id="h-when-is-the-next-escape-from-tarkov-wipe">When is the Next Escape From Tarkov Wipe?</h2>



<p>While we don’t know the exact date, as Battlestate Games likes to keep such information private until the last minute, we know the next Escape From Tarkov wipe occurs in August 2024. We’re a few short months away from a significant content wipe, which will completely reset everyone’s progress. It’s a fresh start, a chance to try out new builds and playstyles and perhaps find a competent squad to play with!</p>



<p>Your typical EFT wipe lasts approximately 200 days, with some a little shorter and some a bit longer, but most right around that timeframe. It’s the perfect amount of time for even more casual players to make significant progress, test out new content, and explore the various maps.</p>







<h2 id="h-how-to-survive-escape-from-tarkov-wipe-day">How to Survive Escape From Tarkov Wipe Day</h2>



<p>If you intend to take part in wipe day festivities, prepare yourself!</p>



<ul>
<li>Whenever the game preps for a content wipe, Battlestate introduces a variety of in-game events that alter loot values, increase boss spawns, and change fundamentals about the overall gameplay. You’ll want to check in on these events to learn more before diving headfirst into a match.</li>



<li>You’ll face many sweaty streamers and hardcore players who will likely surpass your level and gear on day one, so don’t sweat firefights. The early game usually has some of the best gunfights, so enjoy them and take everything in stride.</li>



<li>Remember to take an occasional break. From personal experience, it can be easy to endure tunnel vision as you set yourself a goal for wipe day and ignore everything else to achieve said objective.</li>
</ul>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/the-new-york-times-suing-another-wordle-off-shoot/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=the-new-york-times-suing-another-wordle-off-shoot<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="139" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">The New York Times has sued an offshoot of its viral web game <em>Wordle</em>. Again. If I had to guess, the word of the day is “petty.”</p> <p data-characters="463" data-current-count="463" data-injectable="true">This time, the [insert-word-here]-le game on the legal chopping block is <em>Worldle</em>, a geography-themed puzzle game designed by Seattle-based developer Kory McDonald.<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/wordle-owner-new-york-times-suing-one-man-country-guessing-game-worldle"> Averaging around 100,000 players a month</a>, Worldle presents you with the outline of a specific country or territory and challenges you to guess which one it is. It’s like a highly condensed version of <em>Where in the World is Carmen Sandiego?</em>, but you aren’t looking for a trench-coated spy.</p>
 <p data-characters="379" data-current-count="379" data-injectable="false">Unfortunately, Worldle is now in the crosshairs of the New York Times, which purchased Wordle from its original developer, Josh Wardle,<a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/business-60208463"> for an undisclosed seven-figure sum back in 2022</a>. In a legal document<a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cjrr5ee5zv8o"> obtained by the BBC</a>, The New York Times argues that McDonald is trying to “cause confusion” and take advantage of Wordle’s “enormous goodwill”.</p> <p data-characters="310" data-current-count="689" data-injectable="true">I’ll be the first to admit that Worldle shares more than a few DNA strands with Wordle, but McDonald is far from the first developer to coast off of Wordle’s success. There’s a Wordle clone for<a href="https://nerdlegame.com/"> mathematicians</a>,<a href="https://heardlewordle.io/"> music lovers</a>, and<a href="https://squirdle.fireblend.com/"> <em>Pokemon</em> fans</a>. I’m especially fond of the last one, myself.</p>
 <p data-characters="376" data-current-count="376" data-injectable="false">This isn’t even the first time the New York Times has sicced the metaphorical hounds on a game inspired by Wordle. The newspaper has proven to be immensely protective of what has become one of its most marketable investments, <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/news/wordle-new-york-times-sping-off-worldle-b2554465.html">filing DMCAs against many Wordle-inspired games</a>. If there’s an -le at the end of its title, the game may as well paint a target on itself.</p> <p data-characters="235" data-current-count="611" data-injectable="false">Fortunately for Worldle fans, McDonald told the BBC that he’s not letting his game go down without a fight, telling the interviewer that “worst-case scenario, we’ll change the name, but I think we’ll be okay.”</p>

<p data-characters="277" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">I’m of the unwavering opinion that <em>Lego</em> and <em>Star Wars</em> go together like peanut butter and chocolate. <em>Lego’</em>s vast library of <em>Star Wars</em>-themed sets contains some of the finest sets ever molded, and there are hundreds of them out there for fans of both brands to enjoy.</p> <p data-characters="313" data-current-count="313" data-injectable="false">Building <em>Legos </em>can be an expensive hobby, and<em> Star Wars Lego</em> sets tend to be a bit pricier <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/best-lego-harry-potter-sets/">than other licensed <em>Lego</em> sets</a>. But once you’ve put them together, these sets will make incredible room decorations, and they may even become valuable collector’s items if<em> Lego</em> ever decides to stop selling them.</p> <p data-characters="341" data-current-count="654" data-injectable="true">Sadly, several sets on this list were pulled off the production line years ago, but that doesn’t mean you can’t get your hands on them. The prices tagged onto each set are those listed on the official <em>Lego </em>website, but you should be able to find most of the retired sets on Amazon, eBay, and any other websites that peddle Legos.</p>

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-incredible-animations-footage/">Kingdom Come Deliverance 2</a>'s scope was impacted by the Xbox Series S hardware limitations, as developers could only make a game that was 25% bigger than its predecessor.</p>
<p>As reported on the Czech website <a href="https://www.zing.cz/novinky/96488679/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-pobezi-na-konzolich-ve-4k-a-30-fps/">Zing.cz</a>, during the ongoing <a href="https://www.game-access.com/conference/">Game Access</a> event in Brno, Czech Republic, producer Martin Klíma confirmed that the Xbox Series S technical limitations, namely the 10 GB of RAM, have impacted Kingdom Come Deliverance 2's scope. As the weakest current generation console has only 25% more RAM, Warhorse Studios decided to make the game only 25% bigger than its predecessor. This isn't the first time we have heard how Microsoft's console impacted the development of multiplatform games, but it is still disappointing.</p>
<p>During the event, the Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 producer also revealed that on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X, the game will run at 4K resolution and 30 frames per second, although it wasn't specified if it will be 4K native resolution or upscaled. On Xbox Series S, the game will run at 1440p resolution and 30 FPS mode. The lack of multiple display modes suggests the game will be CPU-intensive, which is expected for an open-world role-playing game.</p>
<p>While Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 running at only 30 FPS on consoles is disappointing, performance should be stable at the very least. The game is apparently already running steadily at above 30 FPS, so at this early stage, optimization is definitely ahead of the first entry in the series, which didn't run very smoothly on consoles. On PC, the developers <a href="https://wccftech.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii-already-runs-up-to-80fps-with-dlss-at-4k/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed</a> to Wccftech that NVIDIA DLSS already enables up to 80 FPS at 4K resolution with Very High graphics settings (running on an AMD Ryzen 7950X3D CPU and RTX 4080 Super GPU).</p>
<p>Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 launches <a href="https://wccftech.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-is-out-this-year-and-its-looking-great-not-to-mention-twice-as-large/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this year</a> on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S.</p>

		<p>It’s going to take a lot to knock <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/call-of-duty">Call of Duty</a> off the top spot, having presided over the first person shooter for what now seems like aeons. Sure, it’s had some stiff competition over the years, and still plays second fiddle to <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/counter-strike">Counter-Strike</a> in the hardcore PC realm, though few have come close to imitating its slick modernisation of the arcade shooter. Not until XDefiant, that is.</p>
<p><iframe title="XDefiant: Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NoNpmAzGyB8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p><a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/xdefiant">XDefiant</a> closely apes its power-selling counterpart with a particular focus on sharp gunplay, quick movement, and a shedload of weapon customisation options. The team at <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/ubisoft">Ubisoft</a> San Francisco have carefully replicated that Call of Duty “feel” albeit with some interesting modes and mechanics hoisted from elsewhere within the genre.</p>


<p>There’s a big dollop of <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/overwatch">Overwatch</a>, as seen in XDefiant’s hero-like Factions. Based on popular Ubisoft IP including Ghost Recon, Far Cry, and even Watch Dogs, each Faction has its own unique cluster of traits including a passive power, two active powers, and an ultimate. Within these Factions are different characters though these only offer a cosmetic change, complete with their own wardrobe of outfits.</p>
<p>You can freely switch Factions between lives, the same way you’d change weapon loadouts in other shooters, allowing you to adopt different roles depending on the scenario. For example, you may decide to grab a sniper rifle and Echelon’s cloaking ability while defending the first checkpoint of an Escore mission. Then, if the attackers manage to force you back into a narrow network of tunnels and walkways, you may find the SMG and shotgun more useful, especially when combined with the flaming, damage-over-time powers of The Division’s Cleaners Faction.</p>


<p>Even with five factions at launch, there’s a nice amount of variety when it comes to player loadouts and team compositions, though Far Cry’s Libertad and their healing-focused skills aren’t super desirable during those early matches. It will certainly be interesting to see who else drops into the crossover shooter and what archetypes Ubisoft can introduce to keep the team-based gameplay and meta feeling fresh.</p>
<p>Let’s take a pause and quickly talk about skill-based matchmaking (SBMM). While Call of Duty has continued to reign supreme on consoles as the go-to multiplayer shooter, fans grow increasingly nostalgic for the glory days before skill-based matchmaking was introduced. On one hand, the intention of implementing SBMM makes perfect sense, throwing players together in a lobby who are evenly matched in the name of fairness. At the same time, there’s a chaotic purity to admitting players of all skill levels into the same arena. By default, unranked matches in XDefiant do away with SBMM though it becomes a necessity during ranked play, for obvious reasons.</p>

<p>So far the mix of well-designed maps and modes, combined with the frenetic, team-based shooting has me hooked, outgunning Activision’s past two Modern Warfare titles. There’s a subtle streamlining of elements in XDefiant, and a degree of depth that feels rewarding as opposed to superfluous or overwhelming.</p>
<p>Naturally, there’s some free-to-play guff to shoulder your way through. Expect microtransactions, battle passes, and a constant rotation of bundles and cosmetics to crop up, all of them optional. And while some characters are initially tucked behind a paywall, there’s an option to grind out challenges in order to unlock them if you don’t fancy spending real money. It’s exactly what you’d find in the latest Call of Duty, but without the £69.99 entrance fee.</p>
<p>With the launch of its first season there’s already a good slab of content to rinse and repeat, especially if you’re cycling through each of the game modes. Exactly how much stopping power XDefiant gains will depend largely on its future roadmap. Thankfully, Ubisoft is no stranger when it comes to running a successful live service, with Rainbow Six Siege making a dramatic turnaround in its first year to become one of the biggest FPS games of all time. XDefiant fans are seemingly in good hands, then, and Ubisoft will need to keep its momentum if it wants to ward off 2024’s upcoming class of shooters from this year’s Black Ops 6 to <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/marvel-rivals">Marvel Rivals</a> and Sony’s <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/concord">Concord</a>.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/kill-team-termination-review-end-of-bheta-decima</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/kill-team-termination-review-the-end-of-bheta-decima.887079/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/kill-team-termination-review-end-of-bheta-decima<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Kill Team</em>&nbsp;Termination is the final expansion in the Bheta-Decima campaign. Like <em>Kill Team</em> Salvation and Nightmare before, it breaks from the format of previous&nbsp;<em>Kill Team</em> seasons, and while still introducing 2 brand new kill teams, the Termination box doesn't include the wealth of scenery that all previous big boxes have had.&nbsp;In this article, we'll have a look at what's in the Termination box, talk about the 2 new kill teams and kill zone, and explain why this box is different from previous seasons, and if you're a new player, what you need to use it.</p>

<p><em>Kill Team</em> is a skirmish wargame, set in Games Workshop's larger <em>Warhammer 40,000</em> setting. As a skirmish game, <em>Kill Team</em> features a small number of elite troops, fighting special operations battles, rather than huge battles fought with entire armies. If you want to check out the <em>Kill Team</em> rules before you buy, Games Workshop has made the core rules <a href="https://www.warhammer-community.com/2022/08/16/download-the-core-rules-for-kill-team-and-a-new-intercessor-team-for-free/">available to download</a>&nbsp;for free.&nbsp;We've covered <em>Kill Team</em> in depth since the last edition, and you can read our <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/guides/kill-team-guide" rel="noopener" target="_blank">guide to all the current <em>Kill Team</em> products</a>, or check back to where the Gallowdark started in <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/previews/warhammer-400000-kill-team-into-dark-preview" rel="noopener" target="_blank">our Kill Team Into the Dark preview</a>.&nbsp;</p>




<h2>What Does Kill Team Termination Contain?</h2>

<p><em>Kill Team</em>&nbsp;Termination contains:</p>

<p><em>Kill Team</em>&nbsp;Termination is an expansion pack for <em>Kill Team</em>, so it doesn't require everything needed to play.</p>

<p>To use <em>Kill Team</em>&nbsp;Termination you will also need the <em>Kill Team</em> Essentials:</p>

<ul><li><em>Kill Team</em> Core Rulebook</li>
	<li>6-sided dice and measuring tools</li>
	<li><em>Kill Team</em> Token Set</li>
	<li><em>Kill Team</em> Critical Operations cards (not essential for Open Play, but required for Matched Play and are great for easing setup)</li>
	<li>A game board and scenery set (you can use anything you want, including your existing scenery, or the new official set for this season, the&nbsp;Killzone: Bheta-Decima scenery box)</li>
</ul><h2>What Kill Teams Do You Get In Kill Team Termination?</h2>

<p><em>Kill Team</em> Termination, as standard with <em>Kill Team</em> expansions, includes 2 brand new kill teams, the&nbsp;Genestealer Cults Brood Brothers kill team and the&nbsp;Leagues of Voltann Hernkyn Yaegir kill team.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/kill-team-termination-3.jpg?itok=TWWKumFx 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/kill-team-termination-3.jpg?itok=rjTLzgQw 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h4>Genestealer Cults Brood Brothers</h4>

<p>The Brood Brothers, like most Genestealer Cults, like safety in numbers, and their kill team can take 9 Brood Brother operatives (including a combination of 3 heavy gunners and sniper operatives), and also 3 choices from the Broodcoven. the Broodcoven includes the powerful Patriarch (who counts as all 3 choices), with a nightly 4 action points, which it can split across 2 activations each turn. The Patriarch also comes with a once-per-game Mind Control action, where it can change the order token and perform a dash action with an enemy.</p>

<p>The rest of the kill team make up for their lack of robustness with the weapons they can bring to bear, and the crossfire special rule, which adds crossfire tokens to enemies whenever they're attacked, and can then be used by other Brood Brother operatives to reroll attack dice against them.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/kill-team-termination-4.jpg?itok=IF0epCpf 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/kill-team-termination-4.jpg?itok=sNqAqDBh 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h4>Leagues of Voltann Hernkyn Yaegir</h4>

<p>The Hernkyn Yaegir deploy with 10 operatives, and while they're pretty slow, they can deploy 3 operatives using their Dauntless Explorers ability, which gets them further into the battlefield. They also have the Resourceful ability, which gives them resourceful points depending on how many operatives are left and aren't within engagement range of the enemy. These points can be spent to give additional action points to your operatives or heal D3+1 wounds.</p>

<p>My favorite Hernkyn Yaegir operative is the Yaegir Bombast, who has twinned wroughtlock revolvers with 4 attacks, dealing 3/5 damage with balanced and lethal. They get a Wroughlock Negotiation action at the start of the firefight phase, allowing them a free shooting attack before any operatives activate.</p>

<p>Other than missing a trick with the name (imagine Kill Team Termination - Space Marine Terminators vs Necrons), Kill Team Termination is a solid conclusion to the&nbsp;Bheta-Decima campaign. Both included kill teams are interesting, the numbers and multitudes of weapons with the Brood Brothers, and the slow, but relentless advance of the Hernkyn Yaegir.</p>

<p>The included scenery pieces while looking good, only really add vantage points to games (along with the mission actions in the included 6-mission Termination Mission Pack), which you already have a lot of with the&nbsp;Bheta-Decima scenery. They fit well with the set, but it would have been nice to see a more interactive scenery piece in the final expansion for&nbsp;Bheta-Decima.</p>

<h2>Should I Buy Kill Team Termination?</h2>

<p>If you want either of the kill teams in this set, then this will probably be the only way to get them for a couple of months before their individual release.&nbsp;If you don't want either kill team, then the only part of the expansion you will use is the new scenery pieces and missions, which aren't worth it by themselves, and previous expansions have added better scenery and more depth to games. The new missions will almost certainly be available in the Annual at the end of the season, and previous seasons have seen books released separately alongside the individual kill team releases if you're happy to wait.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/known-leaker-backs-years-long-zelda-twilight-princess-switch-port-rumor-while-possibly-mentioning-new-zelda/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Known leaker 'Midori' has backed a years-long rumor about the existence of a The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess Switch port.</p>
<p>For several years, several sources have been claiming that Nintendo is sitting on Switch ports of both The Legend of Zelda: Wind Waker and Twilight Princess. Both titles were expected to be announced as part of the 35th anniversary of the Zelda series back in 2021, but unfortunately, the announcement never came. Still, known journalist Jeff Grubb <a href="https://wccftech.com/zelda-twilight-princess-wind-waker-switch-2022-metroid-prime/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has often expressed</a> that he still expects both games to be released. In addition, VGC owner Andy Robinson <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-legend-of-zelda-the-wind-waker-and-twilight-princess-remasters-still-coming/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has said</a> in the past that these titles are still coming to Nintendo's platform.</p>
<p>On X, known SEGA/Atlus leaker 'Midori' has now also mentioned the Twilight Princess Switch port while talking about a new project at Nintendo which might very well be related to a new Zelda. "There is a project at Nintendo with the codename Edward", the leaker <a href="https://x.com/mbkksstbhz5/status/1796403495291220346" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wrote</a> on X. "This might be related to the rumors of a new Zelda series title."</p>
<p>When another X user said that this project might be related to Twilight Princess Remastered, 'Midori' basically <a href="https://x.com/mbkksstbhz5/status/1796403495291220346" target="_blank" rel="noopener">backed</a> the years-long rumor about Nintendo sitting on Switch ports. "I do not know why Nintendo is not releasing it yet".</p>
<p>As <a href="https://x.com/MbKKssTBhz5/status/1796378724985913396" target="_blank" rel="noopener">explained</a> by the leaker on X, 'Edward' was Nintendo's codename for the 2019 Link's Awakening Switch remake from Grezzo.</p>
<p>It will be interesting to learn what Nintendo is cooking with regard to the Zelda franchise, especially with the current Switch now being in the final stage of its console cycle, and Nintendo having <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-announce-march-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed that the Switch successor will be announced before April 2025</a>.</p>
<p>What are your thoughts on the Twilight Princess and Wind Waker ports that Nintendo is said to have been sitting on? Will they still be released on the current Switch or will Nintendo release them on the Switch successor as possible launch titles? And what about this rumored new Zelda project? Hit the comments below.</p>
<p>The Legend of Zelda: Wind Waker was initially released for the Nintendo GameCube in 2002. The game received an HD remaster for the Nintendo Wii U back in 2013. Twilight Princess was released as a cross-gen title for the GameCube and Wii in 2006. A remastered HD version of the game was released for the Wii U in 2016.</p>

  <p id="YRmAp7"><a href="https://www.polygon.com/pokemon-go-guide"><em>Pokémon Go</em></a> is hosting the “<strong>Stadium Sights</strong>” event from <strong>June 1-4</strong> to coincide with the in-person Pokémon Go Fest: Sendai event. The event focuses on fighting- and flying-type Pokémon and brings a few nice bonuses with it.</p>
<p id="UyxDIi">You’ll get <strong>1.5x the candy and Stardust for hatching Pokémon from eggs</strong>. Emolga also makes its shiny debut, so if you ever wanted the slightly brown-tinted flying squirrel, this is your chance to grab it from eggs.</p>

<hr id="95uNG1">

<p id="AOouDH">This Timed Research, “Glide to Victory,” will only show up if you pay $1.99 to access it. Since it’s a Timed Research (as opposed to a Special Research), you will need to complete it before the event ends on June 4 at 8 p.m. in your local time to get all the rewards.</p>
<p id="YcQNdy">Is the “Glied to Victory” paid research worth it? Meh, not really. While you will get 2 Incubators, I’d only recommend buying this ticket if you really love Emolga and are desperate for a shiny one.</p>
<h3 id="yi7zeQ"><strong>‘Glide to Victory’ step 1 of 1</strong></h3>
<ul>
<li id="UeTMuf">Hatch an egg (1 Incubator)</li>
<li id="XDhT2V">Explore 5 km (Emolga encounter)</li>
<li id="4nmjMF">Spin 10 PokéStops (Emolga encounter)</li>
<li id="Oz0yLr">Catch 20 Pokémon (Emolga encounter)</li>
<li id="RcD4DD">Hatch 3 eggs (Emolga encounter)</li>
</ul>
<p id="QUZbAN"><strong>Rewards</strong>: 1 Super Incubator, an Emolga encounter, 20 Emolga Candy</p>
<hr id="KQ8QBs">

<li id="jz68yN">Explore 2 km (Emolga encounter)</li>
<li id="ZJvTaU">Explore 1 km (5 Poké Balls, 2 Great Balls, or 2 Razz Berries)</li>
<li id="uvoZT9">Spin 5 PokéStops (5 Poké Balls, 2 Great Balls, or 2 Razz Berries)</li>
</ul>
<hr id="V5rUuW">

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/you-wait-ages-for-a-bus-and-then-two-come-along-at-once<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I<a href="https://aftermath.site/blue-eye-samurai-is-incredible-television" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> wrote about <em>Blue Eye Samurai</em> recently</a>. To open that blog, I said that my bar for sitting down with an animated series in 2023, let alone enjoying one, is <em>very </em>high, to the point where I hadn't seen a series as good as <em>Blue Eye Samurai</em> in <em>years</em>. I don't know what’s in the water right now, but having gone so long between passions I'm about to write about the second piece of life-changing animation I've seen in the <em>same week</em>.</p><p><strong>UPDATE May 31, 2024</strong>: <em>The show has moved to Netflix this week after being let go by Max, so we've re-upped our 2023 review to help out anyone who hasn't seen it yet! </em></p><p>While I was gushing about <em>Blue Eye Samurai</em> online and to friends, I kept getting told, "Yeah dude, but what about <em>Scavenger's Reign</em>, have you seen that?", to which I had to reply "No, but it looks incredible, I will definitely be checking it out after <em>Blue Eye Samurai</em>". Well, with Mizu's adventure in the books over the weekend, I finally had the time to check <em>Scavengers Reign</em> out, and <em>holy shit</em>.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Scavengers" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1TRzemJbUsw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><figcaption>Running for seven minutes, this is <em>Scavengers</em>, the 2016 short (from the same creators) that started this whole thing off</figcaption></figure></div><p>This show is unreal. It's everything I've ever wanted from a sci-fi animated series. It's weird, it's wild, it's completely uninterested in doing things by the book. Imagine if Moebius sat down to make a sci-fi castaway series, then collaborated with Miyazaki on designing 117,000 weird little alien guys, and you feel mildly uncomfortable the <em>entire </em>time you're watching it. That's what <em>Scavengers Reign</em> is.</p><p>Set in the future, it tells the story of the survivors of the crew of the Demeter, a deep space colony ship that crashes on Vesta, a remote alien world. For most of the 12 episodes we're only following five people, split across three groups/storylines: Sam (the Demeter's captain) and Ursula (the ship's horticulturist), Azi (a cargo worker) and Levi (a robot) and finally Kamen, a guy who is...having some problems in his life that have not been helped by crash-landing and meeting some local wildlife.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Scavengers Reign - Netflix Trailer Edit" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-8sVMs8sq9Y?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Things happen to these people. Some of them die, some of them don't, they meet some other people, stuff happens. Each survivor has a story to tell, but for me the highlight of the show wasn't narrative; It was <em>Scavengers Reign's</em> never-ending mission to show us as many weird little alien guys as possible.</p><p>As you can probably tell by glancing at even a single screenshot from this show, it looks <em>incredible</em>. The colours, the designs, this is a visual <em>feast</em>, and I mean no offence here to the writers--the story is fine!--to say that I could have sat down for all 12 episodes with the show on mute, just looking at the backgrounds, and I still would have had a good time.</p><p>Vesta itself is a sight to behold, but the real stars are the countless little freaks that have been designed and brought to life for <em>Scavengers Reign</em>. They're in every shot. The survivors can't take a step, sit down or touch a tree without disturbing some odd little creature that looks and behaves like nothing you have ever seen before.</p><p>They crawl then turn into balloons. They look like a tree but then turn into birds. They're birthed by flowers with lightbulb blooms, they're monkeys with shark teeth that can swim, they're axolotl with jedi mind powers. The creatures of Vesta are all just so weird, and unsettling, and they are absolutely essential to what makes <em>Scavengers Reign</em> so compelling, because this is supposed to be a show about being stranded on an alien planet, and these guys really make the situation feel <em>alien</em>.</p><figure><figcaption>One of my favourites are these disappearing bird things</figcaption></figure><p>I was equal amounts anxious and horrified in almost every damn scene in the entire series, because--as the show will quickly establish--this is an alien world! We don't know shit about it! Every flower can kill you, every cute little guy can kill you, the weather can kill you (spoilers: all three of these things kill loads of people). The situation these survivors are placed in is unknown and utterly terrifying to them, and I felt the exact same way throughout.&nbsp;</p><p>Beyond their contextual purpose, though--and<a href="https://kotaku.com/culture/fine-art" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> as someone who spends a lot of time just admiring little details like this</a>--I also just love the aliens from a visual standpoint. I'm in awe at the sheer breadth of variety and uniqueness among them. To sit through <em>Scavengers Reign </em>is to be introduced to dozens of types of animals you could never have previously conceived, and that is its own little joy. Hah, look at this guy. And get a load of this cute little weirdo! And his friend! Little visual thrills, all the way from beginning to end.</p><p>I'm so glad this show got made. It's 2023, I honestly would not have thought, in this age of streaming metrics and focus-tested banality, that a place like HBO would have given money and space for a Moebius-ass animated series about a bunch of colourful little Murder Muppets. Yet here we are!&nbsp;Thank you, everyone involved, however you got this made, you've made a show--and some little guys--who are going to stick with me for a very long time.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24168156/doctor-who-dot-bubble-review-new-episode-6<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="egnQvT">At first “Dot and Bubble,” the latest episode of <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24152946/doctor-who-ncuti-gatwa-costume"><em>Doctor Who</em></a>, seems to be borrowing from <em>Black Mirror</em>’s bag of tricks. It’s set on Finetime, a planet where everyone is accompanied by a small spherical AI assistant called a Dot, which projects a “Bubble” around their heads. Within their individual Bubbles, people live their entire lives — group chatting, watching funny videos or performances by pop stars — and they do not seem to leave except to sleep. Even walking is mediated by the Bubble, telling them how many paces to move in each direction, guiding them to the office, back home, and to meals. It’s a very “kids these days and their damn phones!” kind of premise, but again: only <em>at first</em>. </p>
<p id="LxQYg2">The initially blunt metaphor only gets blunter when the monster of the week is introduced: terrifying slug aliens that are eating the denizens of Finetime alive, as they obliviously walk into their gaping maws because they can’t see past their bubbles. Our heroine for the week, the hapless Lindy Pepper-Bean (Callie Cooke), finds her Bubble’s feed intruded on by the Doctor (Ncuti Gatwa) and Ruby Sunday (Millie Gibson), who spend the episode trying to remotely lead her to safety, in spite of her skepticism.</p>
<p id="ccQi8y">It’s a clever setup, one that hearkens back to fan-favorite <em>Doctor Who</em> stories like “Blink,” and tropes beloved by <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23172599/steven-moffat-tv-doctor-who-sherlock">writers like Steven Moffat</a> (who, surprisingly, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24161071/doctor-who-steven-moffat-boom">did not write this episode</a>): horrible things at the edge of one’s perception, a hard limit on the Doctor’s ability to intervene, and a world engineered for conformity, with safety dependent on characters’ ability to escape societal gravity. This canny structure clashes with the painfully patronizing metaphor at the heart of “Dot and Bubble” — which writer Russell T. Davies exploits to obscure what he’s <em>really</em> doing. </p>

<p id="EvrWvi">Because in between the seemingly lazy satire of the terminally online youth and the chilling thrills of its plot, Davies quietly drops pertinent details about Finetime and what is really happening here. Who are these people? What do they do? Why are they there? Each answer, delivered conversationally in an episode packed with a loud, candy-colored palette, louder social commentary, and one of the creepiest monsters of the season, barely registers. So when you finally get to the ending and the truth about Finetime is made clear, it’s like the floor opens out from underneath you, and “Dot and Bubble” immediately becomes one of the grimmest <em>Doctor Who</em> stories told in some time. </p>
<p id="0GeOIE">[<strong>Ed. note:</strong> This means spoilers<strong> </strong>for the very end of “Dot and Bubble.”]</p>
<p id="Dto4lz">In the end, there is no saving the people of Finetime. The first hint was in Lindy’s rapid dismissal of the Doctor’s warnings at the start of “Dot and Bubble,” and that she only began to listen when Ruby Sunday spoke to her. More hints piled up, leading to the answer of what brought the slug aliens to Finetime in the first place: the Dots. The Dots, in their algorithmic service to their users, learned <em>too much</em> about them, and grew to hate them. And it’s not because of their tech-addled brains blinding them to the real world; it’s because they’re fucking racist. </p>
<p id="k4hbIf">Lindy and the other Finetime survivors refuse to take the Doctor on his offer of safe passage away from Finetime, instead choosing to brave the wilds where they face certain death, just because of who the Doctor looks like. It’s here where the last tidbits fall into place: chilling glimpses of selfishness from Lindy, her lily-white friend group, the fact that Finetime is only inhabited by the young adult children of the 1%.</p>

<p id="faQeqo">Up until now, <em>Doctor Who</em> has been pretty unconcerned with how the Doctor taking on the appearance of a Black man might change the dynamic of the show. On the one hand, this is understandable, desirable even — it would be crass and arguably retrograde to immediately subject the Doctor to racism the moment it became a possible story outcome. It also feels intellectually dishonest to act as if it would <em>never </em>matter. Davies, as the white showrunner who engineered this situation, chose neither trauma porn nor avoidance. Instead he chose specificity: This is how the Doctor’s <em>job</em> is harder now. There are some people who don’t want to be saved by him. There are some problems that cannot be solved by cosmically deep wells of compassion and empathy. There are some people with hearts so mean they will not even save themselves. </p>
<p id="FDridg">“Dot and Bubble” argues that its hero’s role is to stand in the gap and help even in the face of such shocking contempt, because life is precious above all, even hateful little ones — presumably because life can be redeemed, and death is final. It’s hard to accept this, and Gatwa’s performance suggests that maybe such idealism isn’t deserved here. He laughs at the insanity of the situation, and then screams in anguish. Who knows if it’s the right call, but he made one. He tried. </p>

He goes on to say that he can brush off some of the comments, but "when there's a constant barrage of them, it's exhausting." And, when it came to Tales of Kenzera in particular, the situation reached "a fever pitch," especially as the game was roped into <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/igda-statement-game-developers-harassment">ongoing harassment campaigns</a> targeting diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) efforts on social media.</p><p>"Don't get me wrong, there's been so much amazing and beautiful support for this game. The fact that it's inspired so many people and touched, you know, so many lives, it was one of our goals from the outset — to have this positive impact, right?" Salim says. "But at the same time, we are being faced with constant targeted harassment from people who see diversity as a threat. From people who look across the vast landscape of modern media and decide that anything that doesn't speak to them or centers around them is unnecessary and inauthentic."</p><p>"And look," he continues, "there's always a reason why diverse stories can't exist. You know, it's always either we're doing it the wrong way or it's just there to tick boxes and it's just beginning to feel like there is no right way. You know, these exclusionary rules continue to stack up and the goalposts continue to shift until, you know, me, my studio, people who look like us, just sit down, be quiet and just accept the fact that you're outsiders. But I won't do that."</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>"We are being faced with constant targeted harassment from people who see diversity as a threat.</p></div><p>"If there are people who aren't like you in a game, I want you to know that game is still for you," Salim continues. "You know, if the characters are a different race or a different gender or you know, a different ideology or different perspective, that doesn't mean the game isn't for you. It can still be for you."</p><p>It's that philosophy, Salim says, that inspired him to set Tales of Kenzera at a more affordable price than many other games, going for $20 across Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC. But the harassment, he continues, has spurred him to make the price of the game even lower to try to make it more accessible to a larger audience. </p><p>He announces that, starting today, the price of Tales of Kenzera will be lower than $15 on Switch, giving Nintendo a shoutout for "acting fast on this."</p><p>"I'm working with the team in bringing this discount to all platforms and it's gonna start from now to until the end of June because, you know, it just means so much to me, man," he says.</p><p>"I believe this is just one way that I can show you how serious I am about this," he says. "Games are for everyone. Diverse games, they're not about taking something away from you. They're about adding something new because there's room for all of us."</p><p>Salim's statement comes at a time where the games industry has seen an uptick in harassment on social media, spurring the International Game Developers Association (IDGA) to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/igda-statement-game-developers-harassment">issue a statement on the matter in March</a>. At the time, the organization said it was "deeply concerned about the increased harassment of historically marginalized developers and those advancing diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives."</p><p>Tales of Kenzera: ZAU is a side-scrolling action game that follows a young shaman named Zau as he embarks on capturing spirits of three monsters as offerings to Kalunga, the God of Death, so that he may revive his father. Salim <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pyzE90U43zw&amp;ab_channel=BBCNews" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">has been open about the fact</a> that the game was inspired by the death of his own father, and <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/tales-of-kenzera-zau-review">in our review</a>, IGN called it a "touching love letter from a grieving son to their deceased father, told in clever and moving allegories about sending restless spirits to the afterlife, that helps it stand out in the pack."</p><p>In his video today, Salim concludes by sending a message to other developers who have told personal stories that "uplift the marginalized and underrepresented."</p><p>"Your work is so important, so important today," he says. "Whether you realize it or not, you are actually setting an example for the next generation of developers, of creators, of artists, just take that in. Keep doing what you're doing.

<p id="C1vqXt">A prequel to the 1976 <em>Omen</em>, <em>The First Omen</em> is actually surprisingly scary and good. </p>

<blockquote><p id="quvcFJ"><em>The First Omen</em> is impressively scary, with dread seeping into every frame of its Catholic conspiracy. Ralph Ineson uses his excellent voice to great effect here as a priest who has been excommunicated after finding out the Church’s secrets, but it’s Free who winds up the standout, as her character slowly spirals as the plot gets thicker and more confounding.</p></blockquote>

<p id="ugwDco">A young man in a gritty dystopian future who has a love of video games is sent on a mission to destroy the city’s totalitarian ruler. From <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/24141885/boy-kills-world-review-video-game-movie-bill-skarsgard">our review</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p id="JBgThF">The film was largely built strictly for a specific brand of video game movie fans: It’s a checklist of retro beat-’em-up references and meta comedy tropes that some audiences are inevitably going to find broad, excessive, and off-putting, and some are going to find playful and energizing.</p></blockquote>

                <p>Call of Duty is one of gaming's biggest series. Xbox Game Pass is one of gaming's biggest services. It only makes sense then that one of Xbox's priorities--particularly after purchasing Call of Duty's publisher, Activision--was ensuring the next title in the series is available on Game Pass.</p><p>Fortunately for Xbox and Call of Duty fans already subscribed to Game Pass, Microsoft recently confirmed that the next Call of Duty, Black Ops 6, will be included in the subscription service. Yet we can't help but wonder if having Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 on Game Pass will actually move the needle for Microsoft. Sure, Call of Duty has a built in, loyal fanbase, but will fans who traditionally play on other consoles be motivated to enter the Microsoft ecosystem? Will those not wanting to shell out $70 to purchase the game outright be attracted by Game Pass' lower price point? </p><p>On this week’s Spot On, Tam and Lucy discuss that state of Microsoft and AAA gaming in general, the potential for a Game Pass price hike, and whether they think BLOPS 6 will be the title to give Game Pass a much needed shot in the arm. </p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jLsnSrZaPY8" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/jLsnSrZaPY8" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Spot On is GameSpot's weekly news show in which managing editor Tamoor Hussain and senior producer Lucy James talk about the latest game news. Given the massive video game industry's highly dynamic and never-ending news cycle, there's always something to talk about. Unlike most news shows, Spot On will dive deep into a single topic instead of recapping all the news. Spot On airs each Friday.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door Review</p>
      </div>
<h2 dir="ltr">Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door secret character</h2><p dir="ltr">Ms. Mowz, the badge shop owner and self-proclaimed Badge Ninja, is the seventh playable party member and one you can completely miss if you don’t do a specific side quest. The side quest featuring Ms Mowz only unlocks after you return to Rogueport <strong>following the conclusion of Chapter 4 in Twilight Town</strong>.</p><p dir="ltr">Head to the Trouble Center on the city’s eastern side, and pick up the “Elusive Badge” side quest there. Climb up to the roof of Zess T’s house, and you’ll meet "??? the questgiver," who’s very obviously just Ms Mowz without her signature bow.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door Elusive Badge quest</h2><p dir="ltr">She tasks you with finding an elusive badge “in Hooktail’s room” and believes the secret to finding said badge is in the power of the wind. Hooktail’s Room is the same room where you fought the giant dragon in Chapter 1, so make your way back to the Petalburg Outskirts and into Hooktail Castle again.</p><p dir="ltr">The journey is a bit of a slog, since all the enemies--minus Hooktail--are back again. The puzzles are all solved, though. Don’t waste your time defeating enemies unless you just want a fight. By this part of your journey, you’ll only earn one Star Point for each enemy, so it’s not really worth the time.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1727/17277836/4311376-paper-mario-thousand-year-door-secret-character-2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4311376" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1727/17277836/4311376-paper-mario-thousand-year-door-secret-character-2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4311376"></a><figcaption>There's no fold or seam for this one, so it might take a few tries to get the position just right.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1727/17277836/4311376-paper-mario-thousand-year-door-secret-character-2.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Climb the castle, cross the bridge, and hoist yourself up the tower staircase and into Hooktail’s room. Walk to the room’s center, and bring Flurrie out from the Partner Wheel, if she’s not with you already. Use her field skill to blow away a hidden paper panel to reveal a chest. Unlike most panels in The Thousand-Year Door, this one has no visible edges. You might need to reposition Mario and Flurrie to get the angle just right.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Is Ms Mowz worth it in The Thousand-Year Door?</h2><p dir="ltr">Yes, but possibly not for the reasons you might expect. Her combat abilities are a solid mix of offense--a slap attack that ignores enemy defense, for example--and support, including a skill that restores 10 HP to Mario. However, her field skill is what makes Ms Mowz such a good companion to have around. She can sniff out treasure.</p><p dir="ltr">You’ll notice Ms Mowz lift her nose in the air when you approach a hidden treasure, and she becomes visibly more animated as you get closer. The Thousand-Year Door is littered with hidden treasure, especially in the final few chapters, so having someone around to lead you in the right direction is a big help.</p><p dir="ltr">Sure, most of those hidden treasures are just Star Pieces, but if you want some of the best badges in the game, you’ll need plenty of Star Pieces to buy them with.</p><p dir="ltr">It’s probably a good idea to save your Shine Sprites for another party member, though. Ms Mowz’s damage output can’t compete with the likes of Bobbery, Vivian, or even Koops, so only upgrade her when you’re finished with everyone else.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/silent-hill-2-remake-maria-outfit-sexy<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Yesterday during an online presentation from Konami, we got a new trailer and a look at the gameplay for the <em>Silent Hill 2</em> remake developed by Bloober Team. I have concerns.</p><p>I’m not going to sugar coat this: being a <em>Silent Hill</em> fan is pain. The current offerings for the franchise are <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/silent-hill-the-short-message-review" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">uneven at best</a>, <a href="https://aftermath.site/silent-hill-ascension-pepe-silvia-funny" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">unintentionally hilarious at worst</a>. In many ways, the franchise is still living in the shadow of Konami’s last false start—the canceled Hideo Kojima-directed <em>Silent Hills</em>, which players only got to experience in the form of the “playable teaser” <em>P.T.</em>, <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/zmjvw3/five-years-later-its-nearly-impossible-to-play-horror-classic-pt" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">which is now unavailable to play at all</a>. A remake of the beloved <em>Silent Hill 2</em> feels like an attempt to win back the crowd from Konami. But based on what we’ve seen so far, I am not sure that Bloober Team really understand why this series and this game specifically have inspired such long term obsession from fans.</p><p>All of the basic pieces of <em>Silent Hill 2</em> are present. James Sunderland still receives a message from his dead wife Mary, telling him to meet her in Silent Hill, their “special place.” He still wanders through decrepit buildings in the dark, the atmosphere slowly changing around him as he goes deeper into the horrors. The gameplay showcase and trailer portray many specific beats from the original version of <em>Silent Hill 2</em>, including James following a strange little girl into a creepy school, the unrelenting fog, and beating a monster to death with a four by four with nails stuck in it. </p><p>But it also features new, unfamiliar additions to the game. The original game had a fixed camera, which has now been changed to a third person, movable camera. Both versions of the game have a sparse UI, but the original had these charming, chunky serif fonts that are now replaced with something smoother and more modern. Most jarringly, the characters look subtly different and the facial animations, while expressive, sometimes go over the top. These are all concessions to modernity—I also just don’t like them.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="SILENT HILL 2 - Gameplay" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/P10BzlgLjz0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p><em>Silent Hill</em> is all about mood and tone. It’s about echoing footsteps and barely lit hallways—and especially about the subtextual representations of James’ psyche that the world of Silent Hill projects around him. If you get that wrong, then the whole story kind of falls apart, or at least won’t have the same impact as the original.&nbsp;</p><p>In Konami’s presentation about the state of <em>Silent Hill 2</em>, Bloober Team’s creative director and lead designer Mateusz Lenart said something to that effect, but in a way that makes me frustrated: “Our goal from the very beginning was to maintain the game’s atmosphere, while modernizing the gameplay to make it competitive in 2024.”</p><p>I know there’s an element of nostalgia in not wanting to see the modern UI elements Bloober Team showed and in preferring the dithered pixels of the Playstation 2 era graphics. But more than that, there are specific design choices in Bloober Team’s <em>Silent Hill 2 </em>remake that are just baffling. In particular, I straight up hate what they did to Maria. Instead of wearing a cropped cardigan, choker and mini skirt—famously, the exact same outfit Christina Aguilera wore to the 1999 Teen Choice Awards—she wears a sensible A-line dress and maroon leather jacket. As one of my Twitter followers said, <a href="https://twitter.com/taufmonster/status/1796566872936358112" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">she looks like a side character from the sitcom <em>How I Met Your Mother</em></a>. The vibes are rancid.</p><p>Spoilers for the 23 year old <em>Silent Hill 2</em> but, in the old game, Maria looks exactly like James’ dead wife Mary. She’s a classic femme fatale, which is an enduring character archetype that originates in pulp fiction and film noir. She’s sexy, she uses that sexuality to further her own goals, she’s got a secret and she plays all her cards very close to her chest. More than that, she’s also part of the psychological trap that Silent Hill has set for James. All of the monsters—the sexy nurses, the two pairs of women’s legs stuck to each other, even the infamous Pyramid Head—are manifestations of his desire for his wife and his resentment of her illness. Maria is all that guilt and desire made flesh. Against the bleak, foggy landscape of Silent Hill, her pink leopard print pencil skirt is a specific temptation to him, a projection of his sexual attraction to his wife and his hatred of her for not being fuckable on her deathbed.</p><p>While I can understand some hesitance to recreate Maria’s old outfit, I’m frustrated because, well, every single element of that outfit is currently on trend. Every time I leave my house, I see beautiful women dressing either like Christina Aguilera in 1999 or my older brother in 2001 when he was a huge Korn fan (cargo pants! I could not have predicted the cargo pant revival!). Nostalgia for that period of time is at its peak with the generation younger than me, and that’s reflected in fashion.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Christina Aguilera Teen Choice Awards 1999" width="710" height="533" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LatcgQB9aQE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>You can buy a pink cropped cardigan, usually styled without a shirt underneath, <a href="https://www.nordstrom.com/s/textured-crop-cardigan/7806836?color=PINK&amp;size=small&amp;country=US&amp;currency=USD&amp;utm_source=google&amp;utm_medium=organic&amp;utm_campaign=seo_shopping&amp;utm_channel=low_nd_seo_shopping&amp;srsltid=AfmBOoqpOu1kkaUlWtFLEwPLFcVunm0XRadFVE1yEZYBZoZQg8h5fjZZhSg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">at Nordstrom right now</a>. Cropped cardigans are <a href="https://www.marieclaire.com/fashion/g35491708/best-cropped-cardigans/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">an inescapable trend</a> that have been in style for most of last year <a href="https://www.cosmopolitan.com/uk/fashion/style/g44899321/best-cropped-cardigans/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">and all of this one</a>. Similarly, animal prints like leopard print are back in style. As noted in <a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/leopard-print-revival-2024" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">this analysis from <em>Vogue</em></a>, you can trace this trend back to Mel B, also known as Scary Spice from the Spice Girls, who wore leopard print like it was her official uniform, as well as the ongoing <a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/indie-sleaze-revival-vogue-fashion-writers-debate" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">“indie sleaze” revival</a> that is basically an attempt to recapture the version of New York City that made me want to move here. Chokers are on trend right now—you can <a href="https://www.elle.com/fashion/trend-reports/a46991583/fall-2024-jewelry-trends/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">trust this article about jewelry trends from Elle</a> or just take a look at almost any female streamer on Twitch. Non-functional statement belts are also back in style, to my chagrin, and their trendiness was noted as recently as <a href="https://www.vogue.com/article/best-belts-from-the-fall-2024-season-in-street-style" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">this 2024 fall/winter fashion week street style feature from Vogue</a>. This is an outfit hot women wear, in real life, in the current day. It didn’t need updating! Maria could do a photoshoot for Vogue at this exact moment in time.</p><p>I am not the only fan upset by the change to Maria’s outfit. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@bobvids" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">YouTuber BobVids</a>, also known as Bob, is a prolific and enthusiastic fan of the franchise. Over Discord messages, he told me a little about his issues with this redesign, which he called an “unforced error.”</p><p>“I've never seen so many people collectively saddened to not see leopard print and that's for a good reason,” he said.</p><p>But Bob said that it’s about more than just fidelity to the original. It’s about how Maria as a character plays into the entire story of <em>Silent Hill 2</em>. He also noted that some of the character animations in the trailer appear to portray Maria as more subdued and demure than she is in the original game, where she is not shy about her sexuality and the effect it has on others.</p><p>“To me, Maria is intimidating as hell. She's confident, crafty, sexy, and she knows it. She's intimidating <em>because </em>she knows it,” Bob said. “One of the first things Maria does in the original game is take James' hand and put it on her chest while saying ‘feel how warm I am?’”</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Silent Hill 2 - Meeting Maria HD" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rrrMlC14LNA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>“There's a reason Maria is in the town with James, and it has a lot to do with how James feels about his late wife and women in general,” he continued. “The changes in Maria's outfit and attitude seem to signify not only how Bloober Team want to alter Maria, but also how they are changing James to alter or outright remove aspects of his personality that are central themes of the game that fans have been mentally chewing on for decades now.”</p><p>This is all to say: not only is Maria’s outfit from the original game an important aspect of her character and James’ story arc, it is a perfectly realistic, even fashionable outfit for a woman to wear in 2024. Not to be melodramatic, but the way that Bloober Team have missed the mark on how this character’s sexuality is visually expressed as well as the actual reality of what people wear in 2024 to signify sexiness makes me want to yell into a paper bag. This should have been a no-brainer, but we ended up with a character who looks like a sensible lawyer trying on an o-ring choker because her step-daughter said they were cool as opposed to a physical manifestation of James Sunderland’s misogyny.</p><p>I would love Konami and Bloober Team to help usher in a revival of <em>Silent Hill</em> as a franchise. I love the shit out of <em>Silent Hill</em>, and I’ve long wanted to show my husband, who has never played it, what makes the games so special. It would be amazing if this remake hit the same notes that the original did in 2001. But right now, I feel like I’m wading through the fog, desperately longing for something, not yet knowing that my ironic punishment is that I’ll get what I want, but not in the way I wanted it.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Now, after the dust has settled and people have had time to play it, the general sentiment is that it’s pretty good. I’ve enjoyed it a lot.

No, we must think about the future. What’s next for <em>XDefiant</em>? Ubisoft gave us a vague road map, but a dataminer has provided more information. In fact, they’ve shared too much, it seems, as Ubisoft has reportedly used DMCA takedowns to remove some of their online leaks. </p><h2 id="h149130"><a id=""></a>New factions, weapons, and modes coming to <em>XDefiant</em></h2><p>Over on Twitter, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/AgainTx&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/AgainTx" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">user Rogue TX</a></span> has been sharing what seems to be datamined content and files from <em>XDefiant. </em>This leaked content appears to provide us with <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/AgainTx/status/1795831710501982657&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/AgainTx/status/1795831710501982657" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a clear road map</a></span> for what to expect during the shooter’s first year. Assuming nothing changes, these are the first four factions coming to the shooter over the next 12 months or so:</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Assassins from<em> Assassin’s Creed</em></li><li>Operators from <em>Ghost Recon Breakpoint</em></li><li>GSG9 members from<em> Rainbow Six Siege</em></li><li>The Highwaymen from <em>Far Cry: New Dawn</em></li></ul><p>Rogue TX was able to find in-game assets—<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/AgainTx/status/1795830729810788558&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/AgainTx/status/1795830729810788558" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">including icons</a></span>, map names, character renders, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/AgainTx/status/1783230832452186600&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/AgainTx/status/1783230832452186600" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">animations, and more</a></span>—indicating that <em>XDefiant</em>’s current plans for the coming year include these additions. (But keep in mind that plans change and game development is messy, so some or all of this might not happen.) </p><p>Beyond that, Rogue TX also found data suggesting that team deathmatch, capture the flag, and infection are new game modes that Ubisoft is currently planning to bring to <em>XDefiant </em>in a future update. Also found inside <em>XDefiant</em>’s files are some <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/AgainTx/status/1796137738967638290&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/AgainTx/status/1796137738967638290" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">possible new weapons</a></span>, including a sawed-off shotgun, Tommy Gun, FAMAS, turret, RC car, FAL, and G36 rifle. </p><p>But perhaps the weirdest stuff found by Rogue TX inside the game are indications that factions based on <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/AgainTx/status/1795941933539332534&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/AgainTx/status/1795941933539332534" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>The Crew</em></a></span>—Ubisoft’s open-world driving game—and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/AgainTx/status/1795508234683330573&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/AgainTx/status/1795508234683330573" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rabbids are planned, too</a></span>. How would that work? I have no idea. But as a Ubisoft sicko who plays and enjoys many of the publisher’s games, I’m excited for this wild mish-mash of content.

But for now, this seems to be our best look at the possible future of Ubisoft’s free-to-play FPS. </p><p>&nbsp;.<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

He says they set out to make the game, simply titled Astro Bot, to be big, adding that it represents more than just the start of Asobi’s new future with PlayStation.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>"This is really about going up one notch — really several notches — and having Astro's big story."</p></div><p>"We wanted to make a big game," Doucet said. "This is really about going up one notch — really several notches — and having Astro's big story. We call it Astro Bot because we treat this as a new beginning. That's a really, really big game. I think for us, that's the biggest game we've ever made."</p><p>PlayStation’s Astro Bot mascot has largely stayed out of the spotlight for the last few years. Some players may recognize the adorable little blue-and-white friend from the PSVR-exclusive Astro Bot Rescue Mission or, more recently, Astro’s Playroom, a game granted to PlayStation 5 owners for free. While these titles flew under the radar for many, they’ve still managed to impress those who checked them out (we gave Rescue Mission a <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2018/10/05/astro-bot-rescue-mission-review"><u>9/10</u></a> and <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/astros-playroom-ps5-review"><u>Playroom</u></a> an 8/10).</p><p>Astro Bot finally stepped up when the series’ standalone title was <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/new-astro-bot-game-revealed"><u>revealed during yesterday’s May 2024 State of Play presentation</u></a>. <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/05/30/astro-bot-arrives-on-ps5-september-6/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>PlayStation has already confirmed</u></a> the project features more than 80 levels that will see players trekking across forests, deserts, volcanos, and more. The footage we’ve seen so far teases an ambitious outing for Sony’s versatile little robot, but not everything is completely new.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Astro Bot will also continue a trend set up in previous installments by including references to other PlayStation titles. Where Astro’s Playroom had players digging for shoutouts to games from across the company’s history, yesterday’s reveal trailer put robot versions of characters like Nathan Drake, Kratos, Ico, and many more front and center. There’s no telling just how many easter eggs are waiting, especially considering Asobi teased that it doubled down on its cast this time around.</p><p>"It's a kind of eye candy," Doucet added. "There's going to be more. We're going to be talking over time about what they mean to the game, but, yes, there's going to be a big reunion. There's a lot of characters from the PlayStation universe crossing over with Astro's path. It's an Astro Bot story, of course, with Astro being the main character, but there's a lot of PlayStation characters that play a part."</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div><h3>Astro Bot Reveal Trailer Screenshots - State of Play 2024</h3></div></output><p>Asobi was officially <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/team-asobi-official-playstation-studios-dev-new-logo"><u>welcomed under the PlayStation umbrella in 2021</u></a>.

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/the-rogue-prince-of-persia-review-early-access</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-rogue-prince-of-persia-early-access-review-in-progress.886944/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/the-rogue-prince-of-persia-review-early-access<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>As a traditionally parkour-heavy series with a main character who often has a difficult time dying when it counts, a roguelike Prince of Persia game feels like a concept that was simply waiting for an execution. Pair that intuitive idea with Evil Empire, the developers behind <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2018/08/11/dead-cells-review">Dead Cells</a>, and you’ve got an ideal coupling for Ubisoft’s second sidescrolling Prince of Persia of 2024. But while The Rogue Prince of Persia has a lot of potential, at this stage in its Early Access life, there doesn’t seem to be quite enough to hang onto for this time loop adventure to really shine yet. I still have more to play before I put a final score on it, but what I’ve seen so far is a skeleton of a roguelite adventure that will entertain for a few hours, but already lacks the variety to motivate me beyond that.</p><p>The initial and easiest comparisons that can be made for The Rogue Prince of Persia are to assume it is either <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/prince-of-persia-the-lost-crown-review">The Lost Crown</a> with roguelite elements or Dead Cells with an emphasis on parkour movement, and neither of those descriptions wholly encompasses how it actually plays. Without losing its roguelite roots, this new go-round for the Prince puts more of an emphasis on the titular character’s fighting capabilities across a myriad of weapons. Enemies come in many shapes and forms, with both shielded and unshielded varieties, and require every technique at the Prince’s disposal to get through each fight unscathed. Every charge attack, drop attack, or vault over an enemy helps keep your health bar pristine until an inevitable boss fight. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div><h3>The Rogue Prince of Persia - Early Access Gameplay Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>The combat is so involved that it can end up feeling overwhelming at times. An unlucky fall into a group of enemies can be devastating to your life total, and even a good plan to destroy enemy shields can still fall apart when there are too many grouped up to discern between them. When two or three hits can completely decimate a run, it starts to feel like the platforming takes an unnecessary backseat to the combat.</p><p>The story, at the launch of Early Access, is edging on non-existent. The Prince wishes to save his kingdom from invading and seemingly magical Huns, so he takes off toward the castle with a magic bola in tow. The bola keeps returning him back in time to when he first set after the Huns, meaning that the Prince is afforded opportunity after opportunity to free his homeland. It also means he is forever stuck in a loop where he may never truly have enough time to make it there. It’s an intriguing setup that could be a great launching pad for more characters to steal the show, but there’s too little to grab onto currently.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>At this point, the supporting cast has no variety and no depth.</p></div><p>A cast of characters supports the Prince along the way, but at this point, they have no variety and no depth. Azadeh, the leader of the village you set out from, only has dialogue that feels vaguely nonsensical at the moment, clearly waiting until she can either be updated or given more lines before they make sense. Other characters move to the Prince’s camp, which protects those individuals from losing their memory while rewinding time, but very little is made of or by this convenient contrivance. There is plenty of time and opportunity to expand all of this in future updates, but it is a bit of a bummer to start the adventure and feel very little motivation to do right by this merry troupe of one-dimensional misfits.</p><p>At least The Rogue Prince of Persia is lovely to look at, styled like a Sasanian era painting come to life. Smooth animations and bright colors meld into a satisfying aesthetic, even if things look best while in motion and a little awkward when standing still. The environments not only look pleasant, but read well with necessary immediacy as you sprint and fight, which is important considering not every background surface lets you run on it to your heart’s content. I am somewhat puzzled as to why every character has purple skin, but I assume that is more of a stylistic choice than a malicious one. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>At this juncture, there is no voice acting to speak of for any of The Rogue Prince of Persia’s characters, including the Prince himself. This does not feel like a huge loss right now as there is very little story for actors to voice anyway. It doesn’t help the already flat characters feel any less paper-thin, though, and makes it that much easier to run past them without caring what they have to say.</p><p>The music is somewhat relaxed and in the background, never really taking focus away. It’s not bad, but it is a bit of a disappointment when held up against other Prince of Persia games. I can understand how anything bombastic might get tiring over repeated playthroughs, but I would still prefer some catchy tracks to go alongside running up walls and vaulting over enemy soldiers.. </p><p>However, all of the good and bad of specifics like that is largely a wash under the criticism that there is simply not enough at The Rogue Prince of Persia’s Early Access launch to hold my attention very long. It does not take more than a few hours to get strong enough through crafting and leveling up gear – which lets you do stuff like create pools of oil to stymie enemies or slowly poison them with clouds of gas – to surmount the first major boss, and the encounters after that follow suit. I genuinely had a fun time getting through the areas and fights that are currently available, but it’s hard to recommend for anyone who does not care about watching this adventure take shape. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>After 10 hours, I feel like I've more or less seen what it has to throw at me.</p></div><p>After about 10 hours, I feel like I have more or less seen what it has to throw at me. I expect the remainder of the Early Access period to introduce new areas, fights, items, and more, which is good because it definitely needs them. I am still pushing to get to the end of what’s here at launch before I give a final verdict, but I can already tell there is not enough variety – among encounters, among environments, among builds – to keep me entertained through the repeated runs this genre is supposed to be defined by.  </p><p>It will undoubtedly be fascinating to watch The Rogue Prince of Persia fill out as time goes on, as it ultimately needs more than just new content: It needs the kind of variety that makes each run feel truly different. With a slick presentation and a strong combat system, all the right pieces are there for success, so I’m at least optimistic. The Rogue Prince of Persia could have what it takes to one day become the next major roguelite favorite, but it’s a bit far from that goal where it sits now.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>
