            <p>
In my experience, there are two kinds of tank in Battlefield games. There are the ones driven by other people, which are cut from solid granite yet move like ballet dancers. And then there are the ones driven by me, which are made out of candy floss and handle like shopping trolleys. Possibly, this reflects some kind of underlying "skill issue", but come now, that's speculative reporting that flies in the face of logic. <em>Clearly</em> it's a balancing issue. Here's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a> lead producer David Sirland with a little more, based on learnings during the new <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games%22%22">shooter</a>'s multiplayer beta.
</p>
<p>
You may have found that the tanks, helicopters, jeeps and jets on show in said Battlefield 6 beta were somewhat squishy, versus the hardiness of infantry and especially, engineers equipped with anti-tank mines and rockets. Responding to an aggrieved Xitter post (as reported by <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/fps/battlefield-6-producer-acknowledges-vehicles-were-underpowered-in-the-beta-but-says-its-better-than-the-alternative-rather-have-too-weak-vehicles-over-too-powerful/">PCGamer</a>), Sirland acknowledged that there's a balancing issue here, but also, suggested that developers DICE, Ripple, Motive and Criterion may have lowballed the rides to begin with, in order to set a good foundation.
</p>
<p>
"That is a balance issue wholesale, not specific to this special situation however," he <a href="https://x.com/tiggr_/status/1965413764414718144">wrote</a>, when one user complained about the potency of said engineers and their dastardly munitions. "And one we are actively working on. Rather have too weak vehicles over too powerful to start. Its a tricky one as players get better at using them over time as well."
</p>
<p>
I find this both funny and interesting. Funny because Battlefield 6 has made a drinking game out of slaughtering vehicles in trailers: those choppers certainly don't seem fit for much besides blowing up. And interesting because it's a quick glimpse into the ever-gripping intricacies of game balancing.</p><p>There is arguably no such thing as "good balance" inasmuch as balancing is an on-going process - developers have to keep adjusting the mixture to keep up with the ingenuity and quirks of clashing groups of players, while hazily targeting some kind of optimal all-round experience. Sirland's aside has made me consider the prospect that developers might deliberately ship a game they consider 'unbalanced' because they're trying to anticipate how player behaviour might evolve. They're trying to balance for how people will be playing in a few month's time, perhaps. A fearful gamble, indeed.
</p>
<p>
Add these insights to EA's longer, official account of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bunnyhop-elsewhere-streamers-ea-are-making-battlefield-6-more-strategic-less-run-and-gun-following-the-beta">how they're changing Battlefield 6 based on the beta playtest</a>. There are <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/battlefield-6-is-getting-persistent-servers-and-two-vehicle-heavy-maps-are-coming-in-the-next-labs-playtest">vehicle-heavy maps coming in future Battlefield Labs playtests</a>, so we can get another sense of the curiously variable sponginess of those tanks, which assuredly has nothing to do with the steadiness of my thumbs.</p>
<p>The final game will release on October 10th. The single player story sees the US army trying to save NATO from a rogue PMC, which I think is <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/please-make-the-usa-the-villain-in-the-next-call-of-duty-or-battlefield-game">a bit daft</a> given the current US administration's foreign policies.

            <p>Dead Island 3 might not be officially announced, but current series developer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/dambusterstudios">Dambuster Studios</a> has given a very serious hint, nod, and wink towards it being in development.</p>
<p>In a post on <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/934700/announcements/detail/505086494235427243">Steam</a>, the developer gave a small, but rather obvious hint and what is coming next in the zombie-slaying series.</p>
<figure>

<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Dambuster Studios</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<blockquote><p>It's been 14 years since Dead Island first splattered onto the scene, stranding players in the blood-soaked paradise of Banoi.</p>
<p>Since then, the zompocalypse has crawled from tropical shores to the sun-drenched chaos of HELL-A in Dead Island 2, where over 20 million Slayers have left nothing but carnage behind.</p>
<p>This isn’t the final cut though. Dambuster Studios are already carving out what comes next.</p>
<p>For now, the details stay under wraps, the outbreak is far from over…</p></blockquote>
<p>That's it as far as new information. From the teaser image, which appears to show <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dead-island-2">Dead Island 2</a>'s Jacob trying to hitch a ride out of LA, we're definitely looking at the next game moving to a new location.</p>
<p>While there's a possibility this tease is for a stand-alone expansion of sorts, similar to Dead Island follow-up, Riptide, it's been two and a half years since Dead Island 2 released and a full titled sequel feels most likely.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Independent developer Questline just released a big patch for their open world action roleplaying game Tainted Grail: Fall of Avalon. The patch adds the following features and content:</p>



<ul>
<li>New Game Plus (NG+)</li>



<li>Transmog system</li>



<li>Various Forlorn Swords (Act 3) fixes and content additions, including much more loot to find and three new caves</li>



<li>Third-person perspective camera improvements</li>



<li>Late-game console stability improvements</li>



<li>New Qrko (the cute pet) forms, including a mount and a summon, have been added</li>



<li>Origin Potion crafting recipe</li>



<li>New weapons and armor sets</li>



<li>Three new dungeons and six new quests. There are also a lot of other quest fixes, new rewards, dungeon redesigns, etc.</li>



<li>There are also a bunch of visual and audio updates (in-game, UI, etc.)</li>



<li>New enemy sound effects and a few extra tracks by Dzivia</li>
</ul>



<p>Update 1.1 also introduces many bug fixes and minor tweaks to the game. You can read the full changelog <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1466060/view/541115924558645329" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on Steam</a>. Questline has shared a 20-minute video crafted by YouTuber WolfheartFPS for those who prefer a visual overview.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Tainted Grail: The Fall of Avalon launched in late May after a sizable early access period. The game earned itself a decent fanbase on Steam, where it is estimated to have sold between 520K and 645K units. Steam user reviews are also very positive, with an 88% rating. However, Wccftech's Kai Tatsumoto <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/tainted-grail-something-wyrd/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rated the game 6.5 out of 10</a> due to some severe bugs:</p>



<p><em>Alas, my fifty-hour playthrough of Tainted Grail: The Fall of Avalon ended with a whimper as I could do little more than roam around the two maps I had fully cleared, a world that’s beautiful when you stop to examine the splendor but is interrupted by hitches and slowdown the moment you start walking forward. Perhaps in another few months time, once Questline has had the time to patch out the game-crushing bugs, this is one trip to Avalon worth checking out.</em></p>



<p>Hopefully, this patch has solved them.</p>

<p>Introducing the Detective and Viper</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure><a title="Among Us" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/8ee65c8e5c04b/among-us.large.jpg"></a></figure><p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/among_us">Among Us</a> has received a new update across all platforms this week, bumping it up to Version 17.0.0 and adding two new roles to the game along with various quality of life updates.</p>
<p>The new roles include the Detective and the Viper. Here's a rundown about both roles courtesy of developer Innersloth, along with a look:</p>
<h3>Detective<br></h3>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Notes:</strong> Keep track of a dead Crewmate’s location, your list of suspects, and what kind of Impostor you’re looking for.</p></blockquote><blockquote>
<p><strong>Interrogate:</strong> Start questioning your fellow Crewmates, and find out where they were during the crime!</p>
<p>You can only use the ability on one active case at a time! You’ll need to switch the file if you’re researching multiple murders.</p>
<p>You can change how many Interrogations a Detective can do via the advanced role settings when you’re in the Dropship.</p>
<p>When we made this role, we really wanted to make Emergency Meeting discussions even more fun!</p>
<p>Be careful, though! As you start putting the pieces together, you might be the Impostor’s next target. Make sure to grab a fresh notebook and your magnifying glass — you’re gonna need ’em!</p>
</blockquote>
<h3>Viper</h3>

<blockquote>
<p>This new Impostor role is perfect for destroying, or in this case, dissolving their victims. Use a well-timed Sabotage to keep the rest of the crew busy while you use your <strong>Acid</strong> ability and watch the Crewmate’s body slowly melt away. Here’s how it works:</p>
<p>After a kill, the Crewmate corpse will decay in 3 stages: slightly dissolved, very dissolved, and then just a bone before it’s completely gone.</p>
<p>You can adjust how quickly the corpse dissolves in the advanced role settings in the Dropship.</p>
<p>Before long, the body is gone, and all you have to worry about is your alibi. Time it right and you might achieve the ultimate Impostor dream: killing without leaving any trace of it behind. No one’s going to call an Emergency Meeting when there’s nothing, right?</p>
<p>If you find yourself on the unfortunate end of the Viper’s acidic spit, sadly… this is your end. But at least you’ll be treated to a brand new kill animation before you watch your body start to sizzle.</p>
<p>We had a great time testing these roles and are excited to see how y’all handle these new abilities — whether you become The Skeld’s greatest detective or you just want to go around spitting at other Crewmates (a lil gross, ngl), it’s sure to be a ton of fun.</p>
</blockquote>
<hr>
<p>As for the QoL updates, players can expect updates to the guide settings, role settings, and an improvement to practice mode. There are various other fixes and bugs addressed in this latest update as well.</p>

<p>"It’s a pig, it’s a plane, it’s the Superman DLC"</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>To celebrate the recent Superman movie in cinemas, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/minecraft">Minecraft</a> has received some themed DLC on the Switch and multiple other platforms.</p>
<p>It gives fans a chance to play as Superman, use his powers like Super Strength and Heat Vision, and take down villains, all while protecting Metropolis. You'll also be able to fly to the Fortress of Solitude to "hang out with Kypto".</p>
<p>Here's a bit more about what you can expect from the official Minecraft website:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>In this DLC, Lex Luthor is opening a shelter for lost puppies, providing food, shelter, and love. HA! Of course, that’s not what he’s doing. No, no, no, he’s doing evil stuff, as per usual.</p></blockquote><blockquote>
<p>More specifically, he’s orchestrating a most disturbing scheme, perhaps his most disturbing scheme yet (and there’s not a puppy in sight). But Lex is no fool, he knows that Superman constantly foils his masterplans, so to keep the cape-clad avenger (you) occupied, he’s stirring ruckus in Metropolis so that he can work in peace.</p>
<p>To unravel the mystery and save Metropolis, you'll have to swoosh through the air, punch, beam, and freeze your enemies, crack puzzles, and if you ever need any help, you can always ask <em>Daily Planet</em> intrepid reporter Lois Lane.</p>
</blockquote>
<figure><a title="Superman X Minecraft" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/1ecc0c044c7f7/superman-x-minecraft.large.png"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Mojang, DC</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Alongside this paid DLC, there's also a free Superman fan top you can redeem in the game's Dressing Room.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Obviously, you want to flaunt and flash the classic Superman “S”, so we’re handing out a free Character Creator item – the Superman fan top! Find it in the Dressing Room and show the world whose side you’re on (NOT Lex Luthor’s!)."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Once again, Minecraft hasn't received an upgrade or anything similar for the Switch 2 (at least yet), but if we hear any updates about this, we'll be sure to let you know.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>On Friday, I went to <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/nathangrayson.bsky.social/post/3ly54pyazjk2c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a rave</a> celebrating a series about fleet-footed anime girls based on real-life race horses. Today, the most-beloved of those IRL inspirations, a dismally untalented horse named Haru Urara, died at age 29, which is pretty old for a horse. An incredible number of people – far more than anyone ever would have expected even a scant few months ago – are in mourning.</p><p>The official Twitter account of <em>Umamusume</em>, the aforementioned <a href="https://aftermath.site/uma-musume-gacha-horse-racing-anime" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">anime horse girl sensation</a> that continues to sweep multiple nations, broke the news to fans earlier today.</p><p>“It is with heavy hearts that we share that Haru Urara passed away on September 9,” <a href="https://x.com/umamusume_eng/status/1965367711531434346" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wrote the account</a>, which has become <a href="https://x.com/umamusume_eng/status/1953800765572632981?lang=en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">something of a horse death tracker</a> in recent months. “The legendary racehorse's legacy serves as the inspiration for the character of the same name in <em>Umamusume: Pretty Derby</em>. We share our condolences to all the staff involved in Haru Urara's care.”</p><p>Across social media, fans have come together to celebrate the not-so-mighty mare’s life.&nbsp;</p><p>“Rest in peace, you will forever live in our hearts, our shining hope,” reads <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/UmaMusume/comments/1nce1jh/comment/nd8hotc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">one comment on Reddit</a> that’s received thousands of upvotes.</p><p>"I came to [university] to do something I loved and started hating cuz of uni and the competition, and AI is taking the role I am going with," reads <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/UmaMusume/comments/1nce1jh/comment/nd8jwp8/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">another</a>. "Haru Urara['s] story gave me a second wind, and I am going ballistic with my side projects and getting myself better. It's because Haru never gave up and enjoyed the run. Losing is never painful if you are enjoying your run. REST IN PEACE Haru Urara."</p><p>Many, many others have shared fan art of Haru Urara’s <em>Umamusume </em>character, including <a href="https://x.com/LuisArreol33565/status/1965370342681313323" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">an image of her being reunited</a> with other in-game characters whose IRL inspirations have passed.</p><p>Race horses are <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2021/may/15/medina-spirit-scandal-horse-abuse-bob-baffert" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">treated about as well as the dirt they run on</a>, and this goes double for those who underperform. The story of Haru Urara’s career ranks among the saddest; before she retired in 2004, she lost every single one of her 113 races.&nbsp;</p><p>"Race horses are destroyed when they don't win," Haru Urara’s former trainer, Dai Muneishi, <a href="https://www.scotsman.com/news/world/horse-that-never-wins-has-become-the-toast-of-japan-2459872" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">told The Scotsman</a> in 2004 (via <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/racing/millions-of-gamers-on-steam-and-beyond-gather-to-mourn-famously-untalented-horse-who-inspired-the-beloved-anime-girl-in-umamusume-haru-urara-may-she-get-all-the-grass-and-carrots-in-heaven/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gamesradar</a>). "But to my way of thinking, a horse is also a living being, and it's inexcusable to destroy it at the mere whim of humans."</p><p>Muneishi also described Haru Urara as “physically small” and fearful of other horses. As a result, training her to race was an ordeal.</p><p>The tide began to turn for Haru Urara in 2003, at the tail end of her time on the tracks, when Japanese media took notice of her unlikely record, which then stood at a mere 80 consecutive losses. That sudden surge in popularity saved her life; in 2003 her then-owner <a href="https://www.thetimes.com/travel/destinations/asia-travel/japan/horse-on-losing-trot-could-be-worlds-worst-lh9p86fnjbt" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">told The Times</a> that she’d been on a collision course with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knacker" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the knacker’s yard</a> prior to that point.&nbsp;</p><p>At the peak of her fame in 2004, Haru Urara was dubbed “the shining star of losers everywhere” and lured 13,000 spectators out to the Kochi Racetrack in Kochi, Japan where, despite being ridden by Japan's top jockey, Yutaka Take, she lost her 106th race.</p><p>At the time, <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/3558275.stm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">BBC wrote</a>:</p><blockquote><p>Japanese television ran footage of the race, focusing on the mare with her trademark pink "Hello Kitty" hood.</p><p>"All the fans seem to be going home happy," a reporter covering for Asahi TV said.</p><p>"They feel that it was OK for her to lose."</p><p>Correspondents say Haru Urara, the eternal loser who does not give up, has struck a chord with those Japanese who have lost most during the past decade of economic stagnation and job losses.</p><p>Her spectacular lack of success is also proving as profitable as it is inspirational. Kochi racecourse, nearly bankrupt, has seen its revenues shoot up.</p><p>Others are also cashing in with "Haru" tours, t-shirts, good luck charms said to contain a hair from her tail, books, and postage stamps. There is a pop song about her and a movie is in the works.</p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p>Haru Urara’s career <a href="https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E3%83%8F%E3%83%AB%E3%82%A6%E3%83%A9%E3%83%A9#CITEREF%E9%80%B1%E5%88%8A%E6%96%B0%E6%BD%AE2008" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">concluded</a> with a dispute between her trainer, owner, and others about whether she remained fit to race – along with <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/UmaMusume/comments/1mn9uuj/untold_stories_of_haru_urara_you_will_barely_find/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">speculation</a> about involved parties attempting to squeeze another financial windfall out of her – after which she spent the next handful of years involved in her owner’s therapy and education efforts. There were also plans to breed her with other famous Japanese horses, but they never fully materialized. Eventually, in 2013, ownership of Haru Urara was transferred to Matha Farm in Japan’s Chiba prefecture, where she lived out the remainder of her days.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Umamusume</em>’s take on Haru Urara, a pink-haired anime girl with a legion of in-game fans despite her penchant for losing, exposed the ancient race horse to a new audience. Her story resonated with younger people in the West as well. Earlier this year, they <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/sim/anime-horse-girls-are-causing-one-real-life-mare-dubbed-the-shining-star-of-losers-everywhere-to-receive-so-much-usd40-grass-she-broke-the-donation-website/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">crashed a website</a> that let them donate $40 ryegrass gifts to her. In the end, <a href="https://namabokusobank.jp/article/%E3%83%8F%E3%83%AB%E3%82%A6%E3%83%A9%E3%83%A9" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">according to the website</a>, fans donated a total grass amount of 3,410 kg, or 7,518 lbs. That is too much for one horse to eat, but I’m sure Haru Urara appreciated it on some level.</p><p>Haru Urara <a href="https://friday.kodansha.co.jp/article/438213" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">died of colic</a>, a form of gas build up that is often deadly to horses, but was apparently healthy up to that point. I find it difficult not to feel a little weird about a situation in which an animal suffered to make money for a bunch of different people, only to be declared an inspiration for never giving up despite <em>her </em>apparent desire to be doing anything else – and then a lot of other people became parasocially attached to an anime girl, further obscuring, at least in some cases, the wants and needs of real animals trapped in a broken system. But it sounds like Haru Urara lived out her final years in peace, and that’s better than nothing.</p><p>"One of these beautiful tragedies," reads <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/UmaMusume/comments/1nce1jh/comment/nd92he3/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a comment</a> on the <em>Umamusume </em>subreddit. "We didn't expect it so soon, but our gal made it to 29 years old. Lived the last of them in absolute luxury and love."</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/unikat-32-33-indie-games-publisher-marketing"><h3>Running A Video Games Publisher AND Marketing Agency Sounds Absolutely Exhausting</h3></a><p>'Seeing all of your different efforts, ones that are synced by the work of many people, all being unveiled at once is a cool feeling'</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/the-author-immortal-image-comics-interview"><h3>The Author Immortal Is A Metanarrative Isekai Comic That Explores The Messiness Of Separating The Art From The Artist</h3></a><p>Amid canceled creators, cultural reckonings, and A.I.’s rise, Frank Barbiere and Morgan Beem’s new Image Comics series invites readers to reclaim fantasy and confront who stories truly serve

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Oh boy, it's time for another instalment of<a href="https://aftermath.site/category/what-i-do" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> What I Do, our regular feature showcasing just what it is that individuals across the video game industry actually do for a living</a>.</p><p>This week we've got Michal Napora, someone who has done not one job recently, but two. And while both have something <em>broadly </em>to do with selling video games, they're also different enough to count as two hats, which is a lot of hats to be wearing in video games in 2025.</p><p><strong>Luke Plunkett: Hey man, thanks for taking the time to chat with us today. Can you tell us a bit about yourself? Who you are, how you got your start in games, that kinda stuff.</strong></p><p><strong>Michal Napora</strong>: Hi! My name is Michal and I’m the founder of video games publisher UNIKAT Label and video games marketing agency 32-33. I’ve been in the video games industry for around 12 years. I got my first taste of game marketing in my town of Perth, Western Australia, where I helped a local indie crew Gnomic Studio with their game <em>Square Heroes</em>. Totally new and absolutely naive, I tried to spread the word on this full-of-heart indie shooter while finishing off my Masters in Marketing. Once I graduated, I shot my shot and applied for a Social Media Manager role at a Polish studio called Techland. They were working on an upcoming AAA zombie horror game called <em>Dying Light</em>. A few weeks after I applied, I had a call with them. Then another. And another. Finally, a few weeks after the application was sent, they offered me a job. So I packed my bags, said goodbyes, and moved from Perth to Europe and worked on <em>Dying Light</em>. During the two years I was there, I learned a TON. My brain was a sponge, soaking it all in. It was fun, and at times stressful, surrounded by beautiful, intelligent, and insanely talented people. When the game came out and received praise (as well as social and press clout), it felt like<a href="https://www.bundesliga.com/en/bundesliga/news/borussia-dortmund-champions-league-finalists-2013-where-are-they-now-lewandowski-klopp-27291" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> we were the 2012/2013 Borussia Dortmund team - a bunch of young up-and-comers that reached the Champions League final</a>.</p><p>After two years working at Techland, I decided to do something of my own, and that’s how my boutique marketing agency 32-33 came to be. Throughout my time at 32-33, I am fortunate to count some great clients: teams such as Frogwares (<em>The Sinking City</em>, <em>Sherlock Holmes</em> series), Bloober Team (<em>The Medium</em>, <em>Blair Witch</em> on Switch), indies such as <em>Dinkum</em>, <em>Bramble: The Mountain King</em>, <em>Medieval Dynasty</em>, <em>Squirrel With a Gun</em>, and loads, loads more. Working on a variety of projects with people from all over the world is such a cool experience. It made me realise that we as people, we are all the same - we want the same things, we have similar interests, and similar loves. It’s a nice feeling to work with like-minded individuals.</p><p>And as of April last year, I started my own publishing house called UNIKAT Label. I believe it could be the first video games publisher from Perth. Our first two games were <em>POOLS</em> and <em>Dystopika</em>, and once again, I am feeling privileged that I got to work with some seriously talented people.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>LP: If you can sum it up as neatly as a business card (or two business cards) allows, what's your exact job title?</strong></p><p><strong>MN</strong>: Technically, I am a Founder. Or the hated-by-me title of CEO. Which feels too damn corporate. Founder is good.</p><p><strong>LP: So what does that involve, exactly? Like on a daily basis, and then more strategically, what is it that you do for a living across two jobs?</strong></p><p><strong>MN</strong>: As someone who runs a publisher and a marketing agency, I do a lot of varied things. At the start of each week, I plan out a list of tasks that I need to accomplish for the next 4-5 days. And as I am looking at my board, talking with people is my number one task - be it on Discord, on calls, or via email. I talk to my partner and fellow people that I work with, developers that I work with, my clients, journalists, events custodians, content creators, first and third parties (just a fancy industry term that describes companies like Xbox, PlayStation, Nintendo, Unreal, Unity, etc) and other people who are in our industry. Talking is something that I do a lot. So plan and talk.&nbsp;</p><p>Next is doing the actual work - be it writing press releases, applying for events, finalising events that I am organising myself, think about social content, and plan out marketing activities. Planning out marketing campaigns is something I enjoy a lot. I also like to take time for myself and that’s when I usually like to think through what worked well in the week, what didn’t, lessons that I should take on board and stuff to watch out for. It’s also a time when I like to look at the long term vision of what UNIKAT is all about. Thinking, reflecting, and writing in a journal really helps me out. Getting stuff out of your head into the physical world helps clear up that head and gives you space for new ideas to come out. Otherwise, stuff just ferments.&nbsp;</p><p>Reading the net - scouring it. Be it for games, opportunities, or information is something that’s on my card too. I like going down rabbit holes and coming across different communities of people. In general, I feel I have a very varied line of work. It’s fun and always keeps you engaged.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>LP: On your best day, what's the best thing about your job?</strong></p><p><strong>MN</strong>: Meeting people. I am a bit of a cheerful introvert who likes to talk. I do like the comfort of my desk and being silent when I work, but talking with people does bring a bit of a smile to my face. I have to say that about 93% of the people in our industry are fantastic people - full of charm, good energy and just want to make games. The other 7% are leeches, but you do start getting a feeling for them after some time.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>I also like the feeling of all of our hard work coming together and culminating to one specific point - be it an announcement of a new game, a demo drop, being part of an event. Seeing all of your different efforts, ones that are synced by the work of many people, all being unveiled at once is a cool feeling. And game release days are pretty special too. There is this quiet freeing point; the moment you hit release until you start seeing responses from the market is a real high - it’s like jumping out of a plane without a parachute and waiting for stuff to happen. The limbo zone. Will people like it? Will people buy it? Will it do well? That feeling of being out but not having the answers yet is sooo freeing. You don’t know what to do, or which way things will go. The reality of the situation hasn’t hit yet. I always get my heart pumping in this spot. It doesn’t last long, as answers usually come pretty soon. And once answers come through, reality hits - be it good or bad. You have a direction of what to do next. You need to plan.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>But actually, as I am typing this, the best thing to see is seeing developers happy with your and their work. It’s cheesy as fuck when I am typing this, but it’s soooo damn cool seeing devs, especially first time devs, tasting success. It reminds me of how I felt at the start as well. Seeing people lose their minds because their game is trending and featured on Steam’s front page is a wicked happy feeling - like being at a rave, you’re feeling ultra happy, the future looks optimistic, and time slows down. That’s also a very nice feeling (and the opposite of that kinda sucks).</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Pools - Official Launch Trailer" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8AFoK14RMJs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p><strong>LP: Conversely, what do you think are some of the biggest challenges you see facing over the next few years? Whether that's yourself, your business or just video games in general.</strong></p><p><strong>MN</strong>: Discoverability. The amount of games being made and pumped out is staggering. And I’m not just talking about the bad or even average ones. There are a lot of good games being made these days. It’s a fantastic position for gamers, as they get to play some amazing gems. However, for people making them, it’s harder and harder to get noticed. There is a lot of competition for eyeballs, be it press eyeballs, content creators, heck, even on Steam itself. We like to say that indies don’t compete with themselves, but they kinda do. We don’t compete for sales, we compete for attention. Some content creators get over 30 “play my game” emails a day. And I would imagine Aftermath gets their fair share of press releases too. And it’s physically impossible for you to publish all of the news. I feel that the massive amount of recent industry layoffs will create a batch of new micro-studios that will have some amazing games to show off. It’ll also mean that a lot of developers, be it big or small, will need to re-adjust their expectations when it comes to sales. And indie devs will need to face the reality of how good their projects really are. I feel a bit of a reckoning is coming. I’m really keen to see where this goes.</p><p>On the “market watch” side, I feel that with people having less and less disposable income (especially in Western countries), it’s the cheaper games that will be winners. Just like social media content, people are ok with dropping small amounts for fleeting game experiences. Play, laugh, move on. Friendslop is a good example of this. I feel that a bit of Friendsloppification might start filtering through to other genres - city builders, narrative games, shooters. Cheaper games that offer a cool experience that can be consumed within a few sessions and we “swipe up”/move on. Will AAAs die off? Probably not. There is definitely space for them too (<em>GTA VI</em> is going to kill it, looks like <em>Battlefield 6</em> will too). But games in the $30 to $50 USD price point might struggle a bit. Imagine trying to sell a $49 7/10 game now? Of course, I could be completely wrong and by 2026 the economies of the world will be roaring and we’re all going to have cash coming out of our whazoos. That actually would be cool. Let’s hope that this is what will happen. However, my pessimistic side doesn’t think it will, and that’s when all of the 7/10 and less games or games not fit for market will suffer.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>LP: Any final shout outs you'd want to give before we wrap this up?</strong><strong>MN</strong>: Huge, HUGE shoutouts to all the people I’ve met along the way! There’s too many to list individually, but looking back, definitely a huge shoutout to the Techland <em>Dying Light</em> and <em>Dying Light: The Following</em> crew. Lots of great memories there. Also a huge thanks to all of the devs and publishers I’ve worked with over the years. Thank you so much for the trust and for letting me play and market your games. Finally, to the industry, perhaps I would say let’s not be so goddamn short-term focused. It’s ok if things slow down a bit. Just think of the long-term vision, what it does to your studio and to your studio’s name. It’s ok to wait a bit to see good results.

            <p>
When was the last time you turned the radio on? I imagine for some of you younger readers, the answer is probably never. To be clear I'm not judging you here if that is the case, or even if it's just been a while, it's a format that feels hard to reckon with when its main point - listening to a range of pieces of music - is made borderline moot in the era of streaming services. All of which makes <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rockpapershotgun.com/games/omega-point">Omega Point</a>, a game where you control a mech but the only thing you can do in it is change which radio station you're listening to, all the more interesting. <strong><em>A severe epilepsy warning is needed for this game as it has a lot of flashing images</em></strong>.
</p>
<p>
Omega Point is a new game from indie dev Cathroon, whose work you may have previously seen in <a href="https://cathroon.itch.io/the-devil">The Devil</a>. A quick aside, if you haven't played The Devil, and you're desperate for a brutalist retro horror game, make sure you take a look at it alongside Omega Point. Speaking of, back to the point!
</p>
<p>
There is no protagonist in Omega Point, only you, the game starting with your body dissipating into nothingness, leaving you with no choice but to board your mech. This mech is the last surviving Doctrine, a machine that exists at "The Conjunction of Science and Religion." Once you're inside, you flick each individual switch to turn the metal giant on, eventually arriving at a timer and a message that says once it runs out, whoever is speaking will be here for you.
</p>
<p>
And after that? All you can do is explore a ruined world, and listen to the radio. There's rock tracks, chiptune, lo-fi beats, jungle, spoken word, looking at the credits there's at least upwards of 50 different songs to listen to.
</p><p>
With nothing else to do but listen to the radio, you do just that, and it makes this experience of watching the aforementioned timer count down feel a little bit less lonely. It's a curious little game that runs at just over 30 minutes (the timer itself is a full 30 minutes), so it's not a long experience, but it packs a lot to mull over in a short window.
</p>
<p>
There's that classic thing that many a mecha story does of what the pilot's relationship is to their mech in conjunction with feelings over the body. There's also the fact that even in such a desolate world, something as simple as the radio can still persist, each station sharing a small expression of itself for whoever happens upon it. A lot of big feelings for such a short run time!
</p>
<p>
A big recommendation from me for those in search of a short, punchy game that feels fitting for the times we live in. You can pick it up, for free I might add, on <a href="https://cathroon.itch.io/omega-point">itch.io</a>.

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/above-snakes-review-unexpected-journey-through-wild-west</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/above-snakes-review-a-wild-west-journey-with-an-unwanted-twist.1293123/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Having never dived into a survival game set in the wild west, I was eager to get my hands on a console version of&nbsp;<em><a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="38d42f33-f793-49ff-b317-05bd4cf7961b" href="https://techraptor.net/games/above-snakes" rel="nofollow">Above Snakes</a>.</em>&nbsp;With all the vibes I was looking for, including being set in the desert, having to consistently find sources of clean water for yourself and crops, and building a sweet log cabin, I knew I wanted to see what the title had to offer. This is how I feel, both the good and the bad, in my <em>Above Snakes</em> review.</p>



<p><em>Above Snakes</em>&nbsp;is a <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="9e2fac55-7c08-4df9-8cd3-a855c0dff7df" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/guides/survival-games-why-we-keep-on-coming-back-for-more" rel="nofollow">survival</a>&nbsp;world-building game set in the wild west before it was tamed. It offers two modes. The story teaches you the basics, unveils what's special about the land, and unlocks new biome tiles to expand the world. For returning players or those who'd rather have a sandbox experience, all biome tiles will be unlocked in creative mode, but there's no story to play through.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The ability to change the design of the world through biome tiles is the best thing&nbsp;<em>Above Snakes</em>&nbsp;has to offer. It costs little to delete a tile and be able to replace it, there are a number of different layouts you can select, depending on what you want, and each biome has its own unique resources to collect. The biomes blend well into each other with well-designed spaces and new enemies to encounter.&nbsp;This is what gives the game its replay value.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/above-snakes-trading-post.jpg?itok=-8YvJ6vx 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/above-snakes-trading-post.jpg?itok=3MYvRm7J 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The biggest issue I have with&nbsp;<em>Above Snakes</em>&nbsp;is the story and how it progresses. I was ready to enjoy a full wild west survival game, complete with ranching, catching criminals with a lasso, sourcing water, and surviving in harsh environments. The game does have those elements, but the inclusion of an asteroid that turns people into Lost Souls, aka zombies, really threw me for a loop.&nbsp;Having to face the undead, whether it's skeletons, regular Lost Souls, or the giant version, took me out of the world completely.</p>

<p>The plausibility of the story is also concerning. It's set up where Aiyana and her mother are close. Her mother is where the asteroid hit, where the most damage was done. Yet, there's no urgency in getting to Corpse Creek, learning what occurred to the people there, or even sending a letter to her mother directly. People mention they fled from the town and asking after her mother isn't even a dialogue option. This was very odd to me, and every additional quest taken on added to that feeling.&nbsp;</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/above-snakes-giant-lost-soul-zombie.jpg?itok=aFdGZuJi 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/above-snakes-giant-lost-soul-zombie.jpg?itok=Ra6rIOJr 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>On top of that, the general writing comes off as shallow. Aiyana is supposed to be part Native American, though the specific tribe isn't named. Her encounters with other tribes, especially those that say what their heritage is, are the same as her conversations with settlers. There's no difference in the way she speaks, even though there should be. The instant trust from strangers, while necessary for a game, further chips away at any remaining realism. Settlers and Native Americans were wary of each other, and strangers had to earn trust before being allowed access to people's homes and secrets.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The controls on PlayStation were smooth and easy to use. Mechanics were easy to pick up, and the first half of&nbsp;<em>Above Snakes</em>&nbsp;felt almost relaxing in nature. Along with the bird song and soft music in the background, I found myself thinking the title was more of a life sim than a survival game. There were multiple times that I almost dozed off, partly due to the relaxing vibe and partly due to the lack of action or progress to be had at that time in the game.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The most difficult thing I came across was accurately aiming my bow. It'd often select the nearest target, including animals to hunt, instead of the one with the most aggression towards you. If you move to reposition yourself, you'll lose your target. There were many times that I'd have a Lost Soul bearing down on me and shoot a series of arrows at a tree or kill a rabbit instead. This lack of locking onto a target or prioritizing hostile creatures over can cause you to die. At the very least, I wasted a large number of arrows shooting at nothing important when in combat.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/above-snakes-skeleton-combat-watch-tower.jpg?itok=ds4Jtf0l 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/above-snakes-skeleton-combat-watch-tower.jpg?itok=mGgw9tX2 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Many of the Wanted Board side quests revolve around defeating an outlaw or Lost Souls. General exploration has you running into skeletons, zombies, wolves, and more. Not having a fine-tuned way to target your enemies negatively impacts the battle experience. I avoided combat as much as possible due to this.</p>

<h2><em>Above Snakes Review</em>&nbsp;| Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>Overall,&nbsp;<em>Above Snakes</em>&nbsp;attempted to be unique with a mash-up of undead and the wild west. If this was initially advertised or included in the general information about the game, I would've had far different expectations for my play experience. Instead, I found myself wanting a traditional wild west survival experience. While my initial time in-game was easy to get the hang of and relaxing, I soon found myself frustrated by a surface-level story that didn't line up with the opening cinematic.&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>Above Snakes</em>&nbsp;could be enjoyed by a specific niche audience looking for what it has to offer. That audience just isn't me.&nbsp;</p>

Earlier this year, Bungie revealed a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/destiny-2">Destiny 2</a> expansion that I can still only describe now as a head scratcher. It's called <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/turns-out-bungies-plan-to-save-destiny-2-is-literal-star-wars-and-two-expansions-a-year">Renegades</a>, a Star Wars inspired expansion (quite literally as it's been made in collaboration with Lucasfilm) that was shown off properly for the first time in a livestream earlier today. Oh, and there's a release date for it too!
</p>
<p>
In terms of the meat and potatoes, actual Destiny portion of it, Renegades introduces the Lawless Frontier, a new co-op game mode that sees you taking on tough missions to build up reputation. Through this you can unlock new Renegade abilities like airstrikes, turrets, a bike. But like, a fancy sci-fi bike. There's also a new social hub, Tharsis Outpost, which is directly inspired by Mos Eisley Cantina, which you can see pretty easily just by looking at it.

<p>
It's a weird thing to look at. There are some of the hallmarks of a "Star War" like that not-AT-ST-Walker. Some of the guns make that classic pew pew sound effect that's been etched into the minds of every person that's ever watched a Star Wars movie. Of course there's lightsabers too, mixed with Destiny enemies that sort of look like they could be from Star Wars but not so much that they feel horrendously awkward. It's like Bungie spritzed some perfume and waited too long before they walked into it - the scent is there, but it feels like it was a bit pointless.
</p><p>
I am eternally sceptical of live service games at the best of times, and with this, even as an outsider to Destiny 2, I'm just not sure it'll do what I presume Bungie hope it will. In any case, Destiny 2: Renegades is out December 2nd, so you've not got all that long to find out if it's any good or not.

              <p>The original PlayStation hit U.S. shores <a href="https://kotaku.com/30-playstation-1-games-well-never-forget-1851713931">30 years ago today,</a> helping usher in a disc-based gaming revolution that reshaped the industry. Four new consoles and lots of hardware iterations later, PlayStation is the undisputed winner in the high-end console gaming space. What were the top-selling games that helped it get there? A newly released list of the top all-time performers across all PlayStation platformers in the States tells part of the story, and it’s a pretty depressing one.</p> <p>Circana gaming research director Mat Piscatella <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3lyftys4rhk2u">released the list</a> of the top 20 games across PlayStation’s history in the U.S. by unit sales to commemorate the PS1’s birthday. Here they are:</p> <ol> <li><em>Grand Theft Auto V</em></li> <li><em>Minecraft</em></li> <li><em>Red Dead Redemption II</em></li> <li><em>Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas</em></li> <li><em>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare (2019)</em></li> <li><em>Marvel’s Spider-Man</em></li> <li><em>Call of Duty: Black Ops III</em></li> <li><em>Call of Duty: Black Ops Cold War</em></li> <li><em>Grand Theft Auto: Vice City</em></li> <li><em>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II (2022)</em></li> <li><em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</em></li> <li><em>Marvel’s Spider-Man: Miles Morales</em></li> <li><em>The Last of Us God of War (2018)</em></li> <li><em>God of War (2018)</em></li> <li><em>The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim</em></li> <li><em>Call of Duty: Black Ops</em></li> <li><em>Rainbow Six: Siege</em></li> <li><em>Call of Duty: Black Ops II</em></li> <li><em>Call of Duty: WWII</em></li> <li><em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 4</em></li> </ol> <p>The top spots aren’t shocking. <em>GTA 5</em> and <em>Minecraft</em> are the two best-selling game ever across any platform. <em>Red Dead Redemption II</em> is the fifth-best. Sony’s critically acclaimed first-party blockbusters also rank highly. And then it’s just a sea of <em>Call of Duty</em>. <em>Modern Warfare</em>, <em>Black Ops</em>, good ones, bad ones, it doesn’t matter, they all rank, smothering any greater sense of the breadth, variety, and whimsy of the games released on PS1, PS2, PS3, PS4, and PS5 over the years.</p>

 <p>“Man, this list makes me sad,” <em>Digital Foundry</em>‘s John Linneman <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/dark1x.bsky.social/post/3lyg7tgphcc2a">opined</a>. “Most people playing games really only play the same few titles huh.” Big sigh. Much agree. Cultural PlayStation juggernauts that didn’t make the list include but are not limited to: <em>WipeOut</em>, <em>Final Fantasy VII</em>, <em>Metal Gear Solid 2</em>, <em>Tekken 3</em>, <em>Street Fighter 4</em>, <em>Dark Souls</em>, <em>Nier: Automata</em>, <em>The Witcher 3</em>, <em>Persona 5</em>, and <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>.</p> <p>Even now, annualized <em>Call of Duty</em> sequels remain yearly best-sellers, cannibalizing much of the remaining market for big-budget console releases. I keep waiting for the wheels to fall off the Activision military shooter machine, not because the games are terrible or I want anyone to lose their jobs but because I think we have enough <em>Call of Duty</em> to last us another quarter century and I bet all of those developers could make new, original stuff that’s really cool, too.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The original PlayStation console launched in North America on September 9, 1995, making today, September 9, 2025, the official <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-to-get-30th-anniversary-limited-edition-bundle/">30th anniversary</a> of the platform in this part of the world. PlayStation has <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/09/09/announcing-playstation-30th-memories/">announced</a> a 'Memories' campaign as part of its 30th anniversary celebrations, but a more interesting tidbit about PlayStation's history came from Circana executive director, Mat Piscatella, who revealed that, per Circana's extensive sales tracking data, almost half of the best-selling games on PlayStation consoles for the entire platform's history are Call of Duty games.</p>



<p>Piscatella <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3lyftys4rhk2u">posted</a> the sales chart as his own 'happy birthday' to the PlayStation platform, revealing the top-20 best-selling games on PlayStation devices in the United States for the past 30 years as of July 2025 by both dollar sales and units sold. </p>



<p>If we're looking at dollar sales, then 11 out of the top 20 best-selling games on PlayStation in the US are Call of Duty games. If we're looking at units sold, then Call of Duty games take up nine spots out of the top 20.</p>







<p>Interestingly, on the dollar sales side of the chart, the only first-party, PlayStation Studios titles to make the list are Insomniac's games from the last seven years: Marvel's Spider-Man, Marvel's Spider-Man 2, and Marvel's Spider-Man: Miles Morales. On the units sold side of the chart, Marvel's Spider-Man: Miles Morales and Marvel's Spider-Man once again make the list, with Naughty Dog's The Last of Us and Sony Santa Monica's God of War (2018) being the only other first-party games.</p>



<p>Another interesting entry on the list is Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock making the dollar sales side of the chart in the number 10 spot. Guitar Hero was extremely popular in its day, though surely it's the added cost of having to buy the plastic guitar controller that boosts it to its place on the list.</p>



<p>Unsurprisingly, the top spot for both dollar sales and units sold is occupied by none other than Grand Theft Auto V. For units sold, Minecraft, Red Dead Redemption 2, Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas, and Call of Duty: Modern Warfare (2019) make up the rest of the top five for units sold.</p>



<p>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare (2019), Red Dead Redemption 2, Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II (2022), and Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 make up the rest of the top five on the dollar sales side of the chart.</p>



<p>This chart is a clear example of how popular the Call of Duty series is in the United States, and that despite series like The Last of Us, God of War, and Marvel's Spider-Man being such key components of PlayStation's identity, they are unable to make a dent in the kinds of numbers that Call of Duty is able to pull, year after year. </p>

			<p>Ironwood Studios has announced the first major DLC expansion for Pacific Drive, titled Whispers in the Woods, and it'll launch sometime later in 2025.</p>



<p>The studio revealed the expansion earlier today as the climax of a live stream it started days before, teasing players with a countdown. At the end of the countdown today at 12pm ET, the trailer below debuted.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Alongside its debut, a <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/09/09/pacific-drive-expansion-whispers-in-the-woods-launches-this-year/">PlayStation Blog</a> post went live revealing more details about the expansion, which takes players on a new journey into the Olympic Exclusion Zone that can be accessed alongside the game's main campaign. </p>



<p>Whispers in the Woods "<em>explores the rise of a terrifying group of anomaly obsessed fanatics hidden deep within the depths of the forests</em>," per the blog post and Blake Dove, communications and marketing specialist at Ironwood Studios.</p>



<p>"<em>From the very beginning, we knew we wanted to take the mysteries of the Olympic Exclusion Zone in a new direction for this Expansion</em>," added Cassandra Dracott, Ironwood Studios' creative director. "<em>We had heard so much feedback and so many stories about the fear people had experienced in Pacific Drive and in With Whispers in the Woods, we knew we wanted to lean hard in that direction.</em>"</p>



<p>There's a new narrative for players to explore that's entirely voiced, you'll also be finding and collecting new artifacts, and there will be new anomalies for you to face in the OEZ. The artifacts "<em>are the expansion’s gameplay centerpiece</em>," according to Dove. </p>



<p>"<em>Inspired by our quirk system, each Artifact is imbued with a condition and an effect said condition creates. Perhaps every time you jump, your car horn honks. Maybe when your car horn honks it also takes damage. While some may grant you strange advantages, others will add twists and turns to how you play. Artifacts can even play off of each other to create chain reactions</em>."</p>



<p>It'll be interesting to see what artifacts add to the gameplay, and what secrets of the OEZ can be uncovered in the expansion. "<em>We see this release as both for our longtime players and a welcome sign for newcomers</em>," says Dracott. "<em>If you’ve been driving through the Zone since day one, Whispers in the Woods is going to add a brand new, more terrifying take on the Olympic Exclusion Zone. And if you’re just starting out, this expansion marks the best version of the game to date with new systems and content to find and explore.</em>" </p>
