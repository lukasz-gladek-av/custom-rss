            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/orcs-must-die-deathtrap-announcement<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Robot Entertainment has announced a new installment in its&nbsp;<em>Orcs Must Die!&nbsp;</em>series.&nbsp;<em>Orcs Must Die! Deathtrap&nbsp;</em>will offer four-player co-op, specialized classes, and improved combat, and it's due to arrive on Xbox Series X|S and PC next year.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://robotentertainment.com/news-archive/2024/7/17/announcing-orcs-must-die-deathtrap-a-brief-history-of-the-franchise" rel="noopener" target="_blank">an announcement post on its website</a>, Robot provides a crash course in the history of&nbsp;<em>Orcs Must Die!</em>, beginning with 2011's inaugural game of the same name, which was swiftly followed by a sequel in 2012.</p>
<p>Following those two games, in 2017, Robot released&nbsp;<em>Orcs Must Die! Unchained</em>, an experimental free-to-play PvP entry in the franchise that "didn't last as long as [the studio] hoped". It was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/robot-entertainment-sunsets-orcs-must-die-unchained-and-hero-academy">shut down in 2019</a>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/orcs-must-die-deathtrap-gameplay.jpg?itok=bIUntYJL 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/orcs-must-die-deathtrap-gameplay.jpg?itok=xXd5ovzm 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Orcs Must Die! Deathtrap&nbsp;</em>continues&nbsp;<em>Orcs Must Die! 3</em>'s back-to-basics approach.</figcaption></figure><p>Robot says it recognized the need to return to the franchise's roots after&nbsp;<em>Unchained</em>'s shutdown, resulting in&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/orcs-must-die-3"><em>Orcs Must Die! 3</em></a>, the first entry in the series to experiment with roguelite systems and mechanics (albeit with the series' signature orc-murdering gameplay intact).</p>
<p>Amusingly enough,&nbsp;<em>Orcs Must Die! 3&nbsp;</em>was originally <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/stadia-connect-819-orcs-must-die-3-announced-as-stadia-exclusive">revealed as a Stadia exclusive</a>, something Robot omits from its series rundown (an understandable omission, given the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/google-stadia-shutting-down-in-january">colossal failure Stadia represents</a>).</p>
<p>Now,&nbsp;<em>Orcs Must Die! Deathtrap&nbsp;</em>continues in the vein of <i>Orcs Must Die! 3</i>, albeit with revamped visuals, tighter combat, and a number of other changes that help it to stand out from both its series and its competitors, or at least that's what Robot is hoping.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/orcs-must-die-deathtrap-shooting.jpg?itok=ZCo6Ztzi 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/orcs-must-die-deathtrap-shooting.jpg?itok=uhIbtuff 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>You'll be able to get your hands on<em>&nbsp;Orcs Must Die! Deathtrap&nbsp;</em>next year.</figcaption></figure><p>New features include four-player co-op, so you don't have to "split up your friend group", as Robot says, as well as new heroes with distinct skills and traps, echoing the approach&nbsp;<em>Unchained&nbsp;</em>took to its playable characters.</p>
<p>A "deep skill tree" and new progression paths for weapons and traps will help you to carve out a unique niche for your hero, and you can also look forward to roguelite-style changes across each run, as well as better visuals and physics.</p>
<p>All in all, it sounds like&nbsp;<em>Orcs Must Die! Deathtrap&nbsp;</em>is aiming to be the definitive&nbsp;<em>Orcs Must Die!&nbsp;</em>experience. We'll get to find out whether it achieves that goal sometime next year, when it lands on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2273980/Orcs_Must_Die_Deathtrap/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor">PC</a> and Xbox Series X|S.

The constant ads have been pretty annoying, but the latest stunt makes me believe that maybe this whole thing won’t be entirely ass.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196181" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Best Reveals From The Game Awards 2023" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="180" data-playlist="196181,196230,191683" data-current="196181"><div><p>The Best Reveals From The Game Awards 2023</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196181/196181_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196181/196181_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196181/196181_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196181/196181_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21718.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>That’s because Xbox has revealed that it’s made a “Cheeky Controller” modeled after Deadpool’s rump. The controller, which was revealed via <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2024/07/17/deadpool-wolverine-xbox-controller-deadpool-design/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2024/07/17/deadpool-wolverine-xbox-controller-deadpool-design/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Xbox Wire</a></span>, is truly a work of art. Continuing Xbox’s legacy of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://www.kotaku.com.au/2022/03/xbox-sonic-controller/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.kotaku.com.au/2022/03/xbox-sonic-controller/">wild</a></span> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/xbox-final-fantasy-14-xbox-contest-art-piece-fake-1851339404&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-final-fantasy-14-xbox-contest-art-piece-fake-1851339404">brand tie-ins</a></span>, its latest collab features a controller wrapped in a skin that mimics the texture of Deadpool’s suit and even features his leg straps along the handles. Most importantly though, the back side of the controller is wildly cheeked up, which might make for an uncomfortable situation if you ever actually use it to play anything, but makes for a hell of a centerpiece that’ll spark a conversation or two.</p><p>To the chagrin of everybody around the world, Xbox is not selling this controller for wide consumption. Clearly, the company is not populated by ass guys. Instead, the controller is being offered to one lucky person via a global sweepstakes, and the winner will not only get the controller but a full set of custom hardware, including a reskinned Xbox Series X that comes with its own set of foam katanas. Between the ass and the fake swords, this prize seems aimed at deviants.<br></p><p>To enter, you must be 18+ years of age, reside in a country that Xbox supports, follow Xbox on X (formerly known as Twitter), and repost a promotion for the controller. Only then will Papa Xbox deem you worthy of receiving Ryan Reynolds’ yams.<br></p><p>Additionally on July 22, the day the movie is set to make its red carpet premiere, the first 1,000 people to purchase an Xbox Elite Wireless Controller Series 2 – Core direct from the Microsoft store will get an exclusive stand modeled after the Merc With A Mouth (And Cheeks). The stand features a statue of the antihero making an “oopsie” face that’ll go perfect with the ass controller. For everyone else, fans can tune into the July 22 premiere on Xbox’s Twitch where even more prizes are set to be given away.<br></p><p>While I won’t be tuning into some godforsaken premiere and fighting for morsels in some Twitch chat, I’ve got half a mind to use my barely active Twitter account to try and get this controller. I’m currently in the process of deciding what the vibe of my apartment will be, and as decorations, artwork, and furniture begin to file in, I’m wondering if Deadpool’s ass is something I should subject my guests to. I guess the real question is whether or not I enjoy dealing psychic damage to my loved ones, to which my answer is a resounding yes. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p>No Man’s Sky Worlds Part I, aka update 5.0, is the first step in another major overhaul for Hello Games’ space faring adventure. This is a universal refresh that will add new technology, new plant life, new animals, and much more diversity of planet environments and types. Worlds Part I also sees improvements in the visuals and behaviours of water and the sky too. Watch Sean explain in the video below.</p>
<p><iframe title="No Man's Sky Worlds Part I Deep Dive" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/XmU3_6BK-Ro?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>No Man’s Sky Worlds Part I has seen the water and cloud rendering overhauled completely. Water is now functioning on a mesh system which allows for more realistic waves and foam generation, while in the sky cloud coverage will vary between planets and be impacted by weather conditions. It will no longer rain if there is not enough cloud cover. The skies will be more varied with the colours of day and night based much more on an individual planet’s atmosphere. There are new frozen, lush, desert, scorched, radioactive and toxic worlds dotted around the universe. Winds will also be more realistic as will storm effects on plant and animal life.</p>
<p>The full patch notes for No Man’s Sky Worlds Part I, aka update 5.0, can be read below.</p>
<h3>SKY AND CLOUD RENDERING</h3>
<ul>
<li>The atmospheric and volumetric cloud rendering system has been completely rewritten for vastly increased detail and definition.</li>
<li>Planets now exhibit a greater range of cloud coverage: over time; from planet-to-planet; and in response to weather conditions.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Planets with rain will no longer use the ambient rain effect when cloud coverage is insufficient.</li>
<li>Daytime sky colours are now significantly more varied.</li>
<li>Night-time ambient lighting is no longer always blue, and can vary according to the planet’s natural environment.</li>
<li>Night-time darkness levels now vary as the night progresses.</li>
<li>Night-time darkness now varies from planet-to-planet, with some being significantly darker than others.</li>
</ul>
<h3>WATER RENDERING</h3>
<ul>
<li>Water rendering has been completely overhauled, and now uses a mesh-based system that allows for true wave and foam generation.</li>
<li>Water conditions vary over time in response to both local weather and the depth of the water at any particular location, producing effects from stormy seas and huge ocean swells to tranquil still ponds.</li>
<li>Water now reflects the sun and features ambient planetary reflections for dramatically increased visual quality.</li>
<li>Water colour variety has been significantly increased.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Base parts with glass now accurately render the water conditions outside.</li>
<li>Sealed underwater base parts will no longer “leak” water into the base.</li>
<li>Ships now leave splashes and trails in the water when flying low.</li>
<li>Underwater jetpack effects have been significantly improved.</li>
<li>Swimming effects have been significantly improved.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Starships can now be fitted with aquatic landing jets, allowing them to land or be summoned just above the surface of the ocean.</li>
<li>A biological equivalent of this technology has been added for living ships.</li>
</ul>
<h3>GENERAL ENGINE IMPROVEMENTS</h3>
<ul>
<li>The shadow-rendering system has been reworked to take advantage of screenspace shadowing techniques, resulting in more richly lit planets and more accurate and more detailed shadows.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The rendering of planetary objects such as trees, rocks, and grass has been rewritten and moved to a more modern GPU-based system, allowing for more objects at a better performance.</li>
<li>Distant planetary objects now look significantly more detailed and realistic.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Terrain generation has been rewritten to incorporate dual marching cubes voxel meshing, which reduces vertex count, increases terrain generation speed, improves framerate and saves significant amounts of memory.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The component system has been reworked for increased speed and improved memory usage.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Networking systems have been improved for reduced bandwidth usage.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Significant memory and performance optimisations have been made across the entire game, particularly in metadata usage, texture streaming, LOD generation and procedural mesh generation.</li>
</ul>
<h3>DLSS3</h3>
<ul>
<li>Deep Learning Super Sampling (DLSS) is an NVIDIA technology, available to</li>
<li>PC players with compatible RTX cards, which uses a deep learning neural network to boost frame rates and generate beautiful, sharp images.</li>
<li>Support for the latest iteration, DLSS3, has been added to No Man’s Sky.</li>
<li>DLSS3 multiplies performance by up to 4X compared to traditional rendering, while retaining great image quality. Learn more on the NVIDIA site.</li>
</ul>
<h3>PLANETARY VARIETY</h3>
<ul>
<li>Planetary variety and diversity has been increased all across the universe.</li>
<li>New frozen, lush, desert, scorched, radioactive and toxic worlds await discovery and exploration.</li>
<li>Underlying terrain shapes have not been reset and existing planetary bases will not be moved.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The chance of a world having ancient bones or salvageable scrap has been increased.</li>
<li>Worlds with salvageable scrap occasionally feature additional rusted remnants to collect.</li>
</ul>
<h3>ENVIRONMENTAL EFFECTS</h3>
<ul>
<li>The wind simulation has been reworked to bring planets to life and provide a consistent effect across each world, moving trees and leaves, smoke effects, rain, fog, and snow all in a unified system.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Fogging and particle systems have been improved for increased fidelity and better performance.</li>
<li>All ambient planetary environment effects have been totally reworked.</li>
<li>Storm effects have been completely overhauled.</li>
<li>Planets can now have a range of additional atmospheric effects that match their ambient weather and hazard conditions.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>The visual effects for the jetpack have been overhauled.</li>
<li>The visual effects for storm crystals have been reworked and improved.</li>
<li>Footstep effect colouring has been improved.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue that caused starship contrails to display a low speed.</li>
</ul>
<h3>CREATURES</h3>
<ul>

<li>New types of procedurally-generated plant/animal hybrids have been added and may appear on any world.</li>
<li>New types of procedurally-generated synthetic constructs can now be found on selected worlds…</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>A new type of hostile creature has been added – the Brood Mother.</li>
<li>Some worlds have become infested with the Vile Brood. On such worlds, players can now find juicy grubs. Structurally harming these grubs will summon the Brood</li>
<li>Mother to project their young…</li>
<li>A new multiplayer mission has been added to the Nexus to find and destroy the vile brood.</li>
<li>Players who defeat brood mothers in combat may earn a variety of new titles and insectoid-themed helmet customisation options.</li>

<li>The Vessel of Many Mouths has been given additional ranged attacks, increasing the challenge of their encounter.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue that prevented the acquisition of worm-cult story documents from the titan worm’s vile spawn.</li>
</ul>
<h3>LIQUIDATORS EXPEDITION</h3>
<ul>
<li>Expedition Fourteen, Liquidators, will begin shortly and run for approximately six weeks.</li>
<li>This expedition invites players to join the force of the Liquidator Vanguard as they seek to purge the universe of biological horrors old and new, including the infestations of the vile brood…</li>
<li>Rewards include new posters; custom bug-hunting trophies; a unique arthropod-themed jetpack and full set of matching armour.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>All those who do their part and contribute to the community-wide efforts to exterminate the vile brood will earn pieces of the new Liquidator Heavy Exomech Hybrid, a set of heavy-duty armour for the Minotaur.</li>
<li>Among the enhancements available to the Liquidator Mech is a bespoke flamethrower unit, perfect for heavy damage at close range.</li>
<li>As the community makes progress in the expedition, the Liquidator Mech will become available at the Quicksilver Synthesis Companion for those unable to take part.</li>
</ul>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nintendos-emio-is-the-first-new-famicom-detective-club-game-in-35-years.929706/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-emio-famicom-detective-club<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nintendo has revealed what's behind the mysterious&nbsp;<em>Emio&nbsp;</em>trailer that appeared on the studio's official YouTube channel last week, and it's actually a new entry in a long-dormant (well, sort of) franchise.</p>
<p>It turns out that&nbsp;<em>Emio - The Smiling Man: Famicom Detective Club</em>, to give it its full name, is the long-awaited third entry in the&nbsp;<em>Famicom Detective Club&nbsp;</em>series, which began all the way back in 1988 with&nbsp;<em>The Missing Heir</em>.</p>
<p>The first two games in the series were <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-and-mages-working-on-famicom-detective-club-remakes">remade for the Switch in 2021</a>, but&nbsp;<em>Emio&nbsp;</em>represents the first completely new title in the franchise for 35 years, so it's a cause for excitement if you're a fan of detective-themed visual novel adventure games.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/emio-the-smiling-man-famicom-detective-club-gameplay.jpg?itok=UPPoZUQt 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/emio-the-smiling-man-famicom-detective-club-gameplay.jpg?itok=8ckW22B7 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Emio&nbsp;</em>is actually a new entry in the&nbsp;<em>Famicom Detective Club&nbsp;</em>series.</figcaption></figure><p><em>Emio</em>'s identity as a&nbsp;<em>Famicom Detective Club&nbsp;</em>game was revealed in a new teaser released on the Nintendo YouTube channel earlier today, which sees series producer Yoshio Sakamoto (who's also known as the director of seminal classics like&nbsp;<em>Super Metroid</em>) discussing his latest work.</p>
<p>In the new teaser, Sakamoto says the aforementioned remakes of the first two&nbsp;<em>Famicom Detective Club&nbsp;</em>games were what spurred him on to make this newest installment.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Per the teaser, it's very much Sakamoto's work; he says he worked on everything from the game's visuals through to its script, its cutscenes, and "even all the smaller details".</p>
<p>He also teases the game's plot, which revolves around a creepy-sounding urban legend about girls who meet a sinister figure and agree to exchange their lives for a paper bag with a drawn-on smile. You can check out that trailer, in which Sakamoto speaks very endearingly about the project, right here.</p>

<p><em>Emio - The Smiling Man: Famicom Detective Club&nbsp;</em>launches exclusively for Nintendo Switch on August 29th. You can <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/emio-the-smiling-man-famicom-detective-club-switch/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">pre-order the game right here</a> if you think it's the kind of thing you could lose sleep over. I certainly do.</p>

            <p>
Back in 2011, Robot Entertainment released tower defender Orcs Must Die!, adding an exclamation mark to spark some urgency and also, irritate anybody who has to write about video games for a living, though not as much as the absolute maniacs behind Tom Clancy's H.A.W.X. Evidently, players did not sufficiently meet their demand for wanton Orc-massacring, for Robot were forced to release two sequels, which I personally would have titled Orcs Must Die!! and Orcs Must Die!!! or perhaps Orcs Must Die!!?, to indicate a mounting existential crisis.</p>
<p>Now, Robot have stepped things up by announcing <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/orcs-must-die-deathtrap">Orcs Must Die! Deathtrap</a>, a newly roguelite, four-player spin on the goblin-farming formula, whose subheading throws bumbling Orc murderers a bone by specifying that you might try building a trap of some kind, a deathtrap possibly. Please find below a suspiciously innocent trailer, which I promise you isn't covering a wall of arrow launchers or similar.

<p>
According to monsieur press release, Deathtrap "stays true to the beloved humor, personality, and charm of the series". We can expect "witty orc chatter", "over-the-top physics" and "a strong guitar- and drum-heavy soundtrack".</p>
<p>They're also promising randomised buffs and debuffs for heroes, traps, weapons, stats and levels. Weather and time of day will further influence the odds. As for the roguelike stuff, you can choose to push forward against the hordes, stacking buffs and debuffs, or return to your castle hub to spend some points on persistent progression. The combat has apparently been tightened up, with a perspective and controls that remind me of Plants Vs Zombies: Garden Warfare.</p>
<p>It certainly sounds like an advance upon the first Orcs Must Die!, which Alec Meer (RPS in peace) <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/orcs-must-die-review">described</a> as "about as good-natured a game as I've played this year: a one trick pony that makes the absolute best of what's a very good trick indeed." 
</p>
<p>
Alec was less keen on the second game, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/wot-i-think-orcs-must-die-2">noting</a> that it "does share its predecessor's sins as well as its successes, which means repetitive and somewhat annoying speech and music, a puddle-deep plot and an expanded but still small pool of enemy types".</p>
<p>As for the third game, I can't find a review on here. All I can find is a blood trail leading to a pit full of stakes. There is a bedraggled, desperate man in the pit who insists that he's Alec Meer, but I will not heed his filthy, Orkish lies, and nor should you. Instead, let's all head over to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2273980/Orcs_Must_Die_Deathtrap/">Steam</a> or the <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/orcs-must-die-deathtrap-3f67fb">Epic Games Store</a> to wishlist Deathtrap - it launches in early 2025. Go on, go on, I swear those links don't lead to any spike pits. I'll just be standing over here, next to this lever.

            <p>
Xbox has revealed a new "Cheeky Controller" in a Deadpool design to celebrate the new Deadpool &amp; Wolverine Marvel film, with a rather prominent behind.
</p>
<p>
A peachy pair of these controllers will be part of the grand prize in a global sweepstakes, alongside other custom Xbox hardware - <a href="https://x.com/Xbox/status/1813559436818227580">details of how to enter</a> have been shared on social media site X.

</p>
<p>
It's in Deadpool's fetching red colour and seemingly offers a firm grip. Just mind where you put your fingers.

<p>

The winner will also receive a custom Deadpool-inspired Xbox Series X and stand, featuring his katanas Bea and Arthur - made of foam, of course.
</p>
<p>
In addition, a Deadpool-themed controller holder (by EXG Pro) will be available for the first 1000 fans to purchase an Xbox Elite Wireless Controller Series 2 on 22nd July, though only in North America and Canada.

</p>
<p>
The news of this controller comes almost a year to the day after the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-announces-pizza-scented-controller-in-collaboration-with-teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles">infamous pizza-scented controller in collaboration with Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles</a>.

</p>
<p>
And Xbox will be keen to move on from its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-rushes-to-fix-feel-the-burn-controller-promotion-following-studio-closures">"feel the burn" controller campaign</a> from May, shortly after it closed a number of Bethesda studios.

</p>
<p>
What weird ass controller could we see next?

			<p>The next game from the Like a Dragon series developer Ryu Ga Gotoku will be revealed in over two months.</p>
<p>As reported today by <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/the-next-ryu-ga-gotoku-game-will-be-revealed-at-tgs-2024/">VGC</a>, the Japanese development studio confirmed it will reveal its next game during this year's Tokyo Game Show, which will be held from September 26th until September 29th at Makuhari Messe in Mihama-ku, Chiba City, Chiba Prefecture. Previously, the studio teased that this game would<a href="https://wccftech.com/like-a-dragon-next-surprise/">&nbsp;surprise</a> fans, so it will be very interesting to see what the studio has come up with to make their game so.</p>
<p>In some ways, the latest main entries in the Like a Dragon series surprised fans of the franchise, as they did away with the brawler combat system featured in the vast majority of the series, replacing it with a <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/yakuza-like-a-dragon-quest/">turn-based combat system</a>. The brawler combat system, however, wasn't put to the side entirely, as it was featured in the<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/lost-judgment-better-call-yagami/"> Judgment</a> series, as well as in the spin-off<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/like-a-dragon-gaiden-the-man-who-erased-his-name-what-is-dead-may-never-die/"> Like a Dragon Gaiden: The Man Who Erased His Name</a>, which brought Kazuma Kiryu back as the sole protagonist.</p>
<p>The latest entry in the series is Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth. You can learn more about the game, now out on PC and consoles, by checking out Kai's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/like-a-dragon-infinite-wealth-end-of-yakuza/">review.</a></p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/clickolding-is-weird-in-a-very-good-way.929667/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/clickolding-review-impressions-pc<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>As a teen, I had this unnecessary job at the town pool where I kept track of attendance by clicking a silver counter when people came in. When it was slow, I’d entertain myself by noting what number the clicker was on and then clicking back around to it. Despite the similarities, <em>Clickolding</em>, a new game by Strange Scaffold, is very much not like that.</p><p>In <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3011440/CLICKOLDING/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Clickolding</em></a><em>,</em> you play as a person meeting a guy in a mask in a dingy room. You need money, and the guy will give you money if you click a clicker 10,000 times. He talks, you listen, sometimes you move around on his orders, and you click.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="CLICKOLDING - LAUNCH TRAILER" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/V62f-PsKhyY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Putting aside the embarrassment of how long it took me to get the wordplay of the title when the game was first announced, there’s clearly meant to be something sexual about the encounter, but the game isn’t prurient or judgmental about what’s brought both of you to this room, the way transactional encounters like this are often treated in games. The vibe is mostly unsettling: the guy’s weird mask, the way he asks you to come closer or move where you can’t see him, the way his dialogue grows introspective or menacing. If you, like me, are a horror wuss, it’s not scary in any traditional sense, but the tension definitely ratchets up the closer you get to 10,000. It’s a short game, taking me about an hour, and as such I won’t spoil much of what happens in it for you, since that not-knowing is key to the vibe the game is going for.</p><p>The fact that you have a goal to reach on the clicker is a good choice, the sense of a looming ending giving some structure to what could otherwise be a game about giving yourself a repetitive stress injury. You could experiment with the clicker, going faster or slower or stopping to see what the guy will do. You could invent a backstory for your character, or fill in the gaps about the guy and his attachment to this clicker. Because I am this sort of person, I had some small existential crises as I clicked, thinking about the nature of clicker games and the fact that really <em>all</em> my PC games are clicker games, and is all this clicking going to break my mouse and do PC mice have a lifespan based on clicks, and is clicking buttons how I should be spending my life. I don’t think this was the wrong way to approach <em>Clickolding</em>; despite the small room the game takes place in, there’s a real sense of roominess between the slim narrative and the one mechanic, letting you fill it with whatever you bring to the experience.</p><p>It seems like there’s more bubbling under the game’s straightforward surface–I was delighted to see players already spinning theories in the Steam forums, or <a href="https://x.com/MarioPrime/status/1813396641736523896" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">devising strategies for clicking</a> or <a href="https://x.com/WritNelson/status/1813432582115045754" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">going for records</a>. Strange Scaffold makes <em>weird</em> games, but they’re also deeply specific, doing their thing for exactly as long as they need to. It feels like an antidote to our age of sprawling live-service: an odd little game that’s just trying to be what it is, and totally worth your time (but maybe do some <a href="https://kotaku.com/physical-therapists-are-helping-esports-pros-play-more-1793007981" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hand stretches</a> first).</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/07/17/emio-the-smiling-man-famicom-detective-club-has-been-revealed/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Last week, Nintendo did something unexpected by teasing a new game with no clues outside of a small trailer, calling it <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/07/10/who-is-emio-nintendo-tease-new-switch-horror-game/">Emio</a>. Today, it has been confirmed that the teaser was for Emio The Smiling Man: Famicom Detective Club, the first new Famicom Detective Club in 30 years. To mark the announcement, series producer Yoshio Sakamoto has spoken about the new project.</p>
<p><iframe title="Emio – The Smiling Man: Famicom Detective Club – A chat with producer Yoshio Sakamoto" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WpFWGeMLhjw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The story outline of Emio The Smiling Man: Famicom Detective Club says,<em> “Junior high school student Eisuke Sasaki has been found dead in a chilling fashion, with a smiley-faced paper bag over his head.This unsettling visage bears a striking resemblance to a recurring clue in a string of unsolved murders from 18 years ago – as well as the urban legend Emio, aka the Smiling Man, a serial killer said to grant his victims “a smile that will last forever”.Does the Smiling Man really exist…or is a new culprit continuing on his legacy? As a member of the Utsugi Detective Agency, you’ve been tasked with investigating the events that led to Eisuke Sasaki’s death. Along the way, scrutinise the clues and testimonies you gather for potential connections to the gruesome events of the past.”</em></p>
<p>In the game, players will have to collect clues and interview persons of interest to piece together the mystery of the Smiling Man, and solve the murder. In terms of Emio The Smiling Man: Famicom Detective Club release, it seems that a <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/emio-the-smiling-man-famicom-detective-club-119249/">physical edition</a> is being made available in the US, but not in Europe. The game has been priced at $49.99, and will be available from 29th August.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://remapradio.com/articles/why-remaster-one-of-gamings-most-impressive-misfires-the-thing/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		<p>Towards the end of <em>Waypoint</em>, we started and (eventually) finished an ambitious 101 project, where everyone on staff (plus joyous gamer and Immortality producer Natalie Watson) proposed a different video game for us all to play, dissect, and understand over the next year.</p><p>My pick was 2002’s <em>The Thing.</em>&nbsp;</p><p>I’d never played this survival horror take on John Carpenter’s masterpiece, but I'd heard a lot about it. It's known almost as much for what it <em>doesn’t </em>accomplish as much as what it <em>does</em>. It’s an ambitious work, and I call it a misfire not out of dismissal, as <em>The Thing i</em>s very much deserving of respect. As I outlined in an essay from 2022 on the experience: <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/xgyqv4/the-video-game-version-of-the-thing-is-an-empty-promise-worth-playing?ref=remapradio.com"><u>The Thing is an empty promise worth playing.&nbsp;</u></a></p><p><em>The Thing </em>attempted to turn the delicious premise of Carpenter’s film, in which an alien is able to successfully hide amongst a crew of Antarctic researchers, into a video game. A game that chose an easier path towards success would’ve made the experience entirely scripted, where every surprise was, like the movie, pre-planned. But the game wants far more, introducing all sorts of half-broken systemic elements where, in theory, a friend can become an enemy—a thing—at any time. Sometimes, it works. Oftentimes, it doesn’t. Every time, it’s really cool.</p><p>Here’s what I said in that 2022 piece:</p><blockquote>“Revisiting older games without baked-in nostalgia is already a difficult proposition, because without the fuzzy positive memories, it’s extremely difficult to situate yourself in the context the game was released in and fully appreciate what it was trying to do at that point in history. Playing games from the past requires a deft hand, because so much of video game design is specifically iterating on the past, often making it hard to fully appreciate what came before.&nbsp;<p><em>The Thing </em>had some radically cool and inventive ideas, even if didn’t know what to do with them. Perhaps the coolest takeaway from having played it is realizing that, even today, not many games are trying to do what <em>The Thing</em> attempted. It’s still exciting.”</p></blockquote><p>It’s a game that deserved a sequel, and for a minute, <a href="https://thething.fandom.com/wiki/The_Thing_II_(video_game)?ref=remapradio.com"><u>they were developing one.</u></a> While The Thing 2 never happened, we’re getting a wonderful consolation prize, as Nightdive Studios, the gold standard for remasters, is turning its attention towards<em> The Thing</em>. Hell <em>yes</em>.</p><p>I recently had an opportunity to ask some of the folks working on <em>The Thing </em>remaster at Nightdive, as I was especially curious whether they’ll try and touch up some of the elements of the game that were clearly supposed to work differently than how they function in the game.</p><p>What follows is a short chat with Larry Kuperman, director of business development at Nightdive, and Joel Welsh, art lead at Nightdive who’s worked on the recent <em>Turok 3: Shadow of Oblivion</em> remaster, alongside <em>Star Wars: Dark Forces</em>, <em>System Shock 2</em>, <em>Killing Time</em>, and others.</p><p>If you’re interested in learning more, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K-xsufeLmxk&amp;ref=remapradio.com"><u>I highly recommend checking out Nightdive’s YouTube channel</u></a>, as they’re doing some fantastic ongoing dives into their work <em>and</em> the original works.</p><hr><figure><figcaption><span>Nightdive's remaster will include a new and more impressive lighting system. This screen shot feels a tad dark, though?</span></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Remap: I suspect Nightdive is used to working on games with missing source code, broken code, messed up assets, etc. What state was/is <em>The Thing</em> in, when you decided to move forward with the project, and how did it compare to some of Nightdive’s other projects?</strong></p><p>Larry Kuperman: We had two major advantages for this project. We began with a repository of the source code, a huge advantage. And then we were fortunate enough to have run into two of the members of the Computer Artworks team, the original developers of the 2002 version. That gave us access to a tremendous amount of assets, most in high-resolution format.</p><p>Joel Welsh: I’ll echo what Larry said. Compared to games like <em>Turok 3</em>, we were extremely fortunate in this case, not to mention we had about a year of prep time.</p><p><strong>When I replayed <em>The Thing</em> a few years back, I wrote an essay about the experience that described the game as “an empty promise worth playing.” I meant that in the most complimentary way possible, because it’s such a uniquely flawed experience. Did you play the game when it was originally released? If so, what did you make of it at the time?&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Joel: I played it at release. Looking back, that was over 20 years ago… One memory that comes to mind is the Rupture boss in the underground crate room right before you enter the submersible. It’s kind of a mixed bag, but I really enjoyed it, flaws and all. Working on the remaster has been a dream come true.</p><p><strong>Building on the same point, a huge part of what doesn’t work in The Thing feels like a team that ran out of time. The answers are in the game, but it just doesn’t function exactly the way it’s supposed to. See: the enemy AI, thing transformations. How do you balance trying to go in and “fix” some of these elements, while training to maintain what made the game eccentric and interesting in the first place?</strong></p><p>Joel: Assuming you mean the blood test, we’re working to resolve it, along with some of the other so-called faults of the original. By all accounts, Computer Artworks created the game they set out to make.&nbsp;</p><figure><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-_P6fwckB5k?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" title="The Thing: Remastered Announcement Trailer | Nightdive Studios"></iframe></figure><p><strong>How much of this project is a collaboration with the original developers? And how often is that an aim for Nightdive projects?</strong></p><p>Joel: In this case, we’re working closely with Ron Ashtiani and Mark Atkinson. Stephen and Larry made that happen. I knew Ron prior to joining Nightdive and his insight on art direction has been invaluable.&nbsp;</p><p>As an aside, his work on <em>Guardians of the Galaxy </em>was quite good. On the other hand, Mark wrote the code for his first game at 11, graduated from University at 16, and built the framework for The Thing, along with several other systems for Computer Artworks almost single-handedly. The man is a genius. Nothing gets past their scrutiny, and we’re really enjoying the collaboration.&nbsp;</p><p>To your second point, it’s important that we reach out to members of the original team whenever possible. For instance, we collaborated with Nelson Everhart for the remastered soundtrack of <em>Turok 3</em>, and Mike Lavine and Justin Chin helped with <em>Star Wars</em>. As Larry puts it, “We don’t know better than the original developers.” Words of wisdom.</p><p><strong>The Thing was a very hard game, partially because it was hard to parse and partially because it felt a little broken. What’s the fine line between trying to maintain that sense of danger and strangeness, versus ensuring a modern audience has a good time with it?</strong></p><p>Larry: We’re currently investigating ways to address difficulty and make other quality-of-life improvements. I think you’ll be pleasantly surprised.</p><p><strong>Is the concept of a “remaster” becoming blurrier for you? Remaster, remake, reimagining. At one point, it felt like a “remaster” was merely getting a game to run on a modern platform. These days, there’s more and more work going in to tweaking and updating these games.</strong></p><p>Joel: I dare say the opposite; the concept of what a Nightdive remaster should be is becoming clearer with every release. Stephen Kick has a vision for the company—bringing lost and forgotten gaming treasures back from the depths. I would compare Nightdive titles to Special Edition DVDs of yesteryears—higher quality presentation with extra features and bonus content. Merely getting a game to run on modern platforms with original assets, as you put it, is more of a port. We still do those—<em>PO’ed</em> is a recent example. It varies case-by-case, and what our partners expect when entrusting us with their IPs. For <em>The Thing: Remastered</em>, Universal has been incredibly supportive.</p>

The sparse fifteen seconds of footage showed a creepy man in a trenchcoat, wearing a paper bag over his head, scrawled with a smiling face. The vibe of the trailer immediately screamed horror, as did the unexpected age-restriction to watch it. Initially, fans theorized this would be horror developer <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/layers-of-fear-review-2023-release-date-ps5-1850541040&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/layers-of-fear-review-2023-release-date-ps5-1850541040">Bloober Team</a></span>’s mysterious <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://strefainwestorow.pl/wiadomosci/20240708/bloober-team-nie-widzi-zwiazku-miedzy-koncem-wspolpracy-z-draw-distance-a&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://strefainwestorow.pl/wiadomosci/20240708/bloober-team-nie-widzi-zwiazku-miedzy-koncem-wspolpracy-z-draw-distance-a" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">project M</a></span>, but now that seems not to be the case. </p><p>For those not familiar with the <em>Famicom Detective Club </em>series, I can’t blame you. The original games, <em>The Missing Heir</em> and <em>The Girl Who Stands Behind,</em> were released in 1988 and 1989 respectively, and only in Japan. The series blends visual novel and adventure game mechanics in its stories of mystery and murder, and while they have a cult status, neither game was easily playable on modern hardware—until Nintendo released <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/these-famicom-detective-club-games-have-aged-surprising-1846898388&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/these-famicom-detective-club-games-have-aged-surprising-1846898388">remakes</a></span> of both for the Nintendo Switch in 2021, and released them worldwide for the first time. I suppose that should have been a sign the franchise could make a comeback. </p><p>Considering the cult status of the series, the first teaser for the game was a smart marketing move. Nintendo spent a week getting people curious about what <em>Emio</em> was, and now there are more eyes on the game than if the first trailer outright said this was a new <em>Famicom Detective Club</em> entry. Fans of the franchise are expressing their excitement in the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/nintendoamerica/status/1813560122549137533&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/nintendoamerica/status/1813560122549137533" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reveal post</a></span> on Nintendo’s X (formerly Twitter), but there are also those disappointed that <em>Emio</em> isn’t the more modern horror title they built up in their heads.

                <p>Nintendo has announced Emio - The Smiling Man: Famicom Detective Club, the first new entry in the series in over 30 years, and it will launch for Nintendo Switch on August 29. Last week, Nintendo hinted at the game by <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-just-surprise-dropped-the-scariest-game-teaser-of-the-year/1100-6524826/" data-ref-id="1100-6524826">dropping a spooky teaser.</a></p><p>Once again, the player works as an assistant private investigator with the Utsugi Detective Agency, and must solve the mystery behind the death of a student whose head was covered by a paper bag with a smiling face drawn on it. Eighteen years ago, there were similar incidents with the victims of Emio, the Smiling Man, a killer of urban legend who did the same. Along with returning series protagonist Ayumi Tachibana, the duo will work together to figure out if Emio has returned, or if it's just a copycat crime.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Emio – The Smiling Man: Famicom Detective Club | Producer Overview Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>In 2021, Nintendo released remakes of the first two Famicom Detective Club games: The Missing Heir and The Girl Who Stands Behind, which were released in 1988 and 1989, respectively. Series producer Yoshio Sakamoto is returning to handle the brand-new game.</p><p>"Both games were designed with the image in mind of a mystery movie that you progress through and solve," he explained in an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AHBtMQaj7w0" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">introduction video</a>. "While we were working on the remakes of those games for Nintendo Switch in 2021, I thought that we definitely need to continue this series with a brand-new game."</p><p>In GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/famicom-detective-club-review-the-n-e-s-murders/1900-6417680/" data-ref-id="1900-6417680">Famicom Detective Club review</a>, we said, "The Missing Heir and The Girl Who Stands Behind, while mechanically similar, offer pretty different takes on the detective game. Do you want to slowly unravel the conspiracy behind a powerful woman's death in a quiet village? Or, would you rather chase down a murderer in a high-octane, spooky thrill ride? The former is better executed, but both are worthwhile opportunities to dust off your magnifying glass."</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/no-mans-sky-worlds-part-i-update<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Hello Games has released the&nbsp;<em>No Man's Sky&nbsp;</em>Worlds Part I update, introducing "a complete refresh of the universe", increased flora and fauna diversity, and big visual enhancements, plus lots more.</p>
<p>Visual changes include new water effects with "realistic wave formations and foam generation", as well as deeper and more detailed shadows, better definition for clouds, and more. Suffice it to say that the worlds of&nbsp;<em>No Man's Sky&nbsp;</em>should now be significantly more beautiful places to visit.</p>
<p>The changes aren't just visual, though; several of the game's planets have also been dramatically transformed with new floating islands that could serve as perfect places for "bases in the sky", as Hello Games puts it. You can't tell me you've never wanted to live amongst the clouds!</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/no-mans-sky-worlds-part-i-update-art.jpg?itok=WR5R0efT 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/no-mans-sky-worlds-part-i-update-art.jpg?itok=jPNsg0br 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The new&nbsp;<em>No Man's Sky&nbsp;</em>update promises a significant visual overhaul for the almost eight-year-old game.</figcaption></figure><p>Those worlds will also be populated by new creatures, "bizarre floral hybrids" that boast "stamen-like whiskers and petal-like faces". Just in case you weren't quite unsettled enough by what's already out there in the galaxy.</p>
<p>Tons of other changes, including improved wind simulation, more diverse desert worlds, and even frozen sub-zero planets with icy trees and glacial rocks, have also been implemented, hopefully bringing&nbsp;<em>No Man's Sky</em>'s galaxy to life like never before.</p>
<p>You can check out the announcement trailer for&nbsp;<em>No Man's Sky&nbsp;</em>Worlds Part I, which shows off some of the game's new visual changes in motion, right here.</p>

<p>Additionally, Hello Games head Sean Murray has also released a deep dive video detailing some of Worlds Part I's changes in close-up, so if you're interested in the technical side of things, you can check that video out here.</p>

Crocs has teamed up with The Pokémon Company to offer more official versions of its shoes.
</p>
<p>
Following the Pikachu-themed Classic Clog released earlier this year, four more variants are due to arrive this year based on Gen 1 favourites Gengar, Charizard, Snorlax, and Jigglypuff.
</p>
<p>
Each design features a Jibbitz charm to go with its colour scheme, as well as Pokéball logos on the straps. I hate them all.

News of the collaboration was shared by <a href="https://www.soleretriever.com/news/articles/pokemon-crocs-classic-clog-pack-charizard-gengar-snorlax-jigglypuff-release-date-2024">Sole Retriever</a> and while the release date is unknown beyond 2024, each shoe design costs $70.

"This new pack promises to captivate fans of both brands, merging the playful essence of Pokémon with the comfort and style of Crocs," reads the post. "Style" seems like a stretch.

Perhaps these garish, jellified shoes are your thing, but I can't think of anything worse to put on my feet, let alone wear them in public. Pokémon Crocs, I choose... none of you.
</p>
<p>
Still, Pokémon merchandise always seems to sell well, and the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/four-van-gogh-museum-employees-suspended-after-pokemon-exhibit-chaos">exclusive card at the Van Gogh Museum caused quite the furore</a>.
