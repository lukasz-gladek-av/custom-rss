			<p>Following the <a href="https://wccftech.com/riots-fighting-game-2xko-launch-early-access-october-7/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">October 2025 early access debut on PC</a>, <strong>Riot</strong> is preparing to launch the fighting game <strong>2XKO</strong> as a full release on both PC and consoles. An announcement trailer <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5BVTEIoD_S0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was published a few hours ago on YouTube</a> by Riot but quickly went private, which means someone posted it beforehand. Still, even though it technically counts as a 'leak', it's the kind where the official source self-leaks the news in advance, and so can be considered accurate.</p>



<p>2XKO has been a long time coming. It all started after Radiant Entertainment, the studio that made <strong>Rising Thunder</strong> (as well as the city builder Stonehearth), was acquired by Riot in 2016. While that meant the cancellation of Rising Thunder, the founders, the <strong>Cannon brothers</strong>, quickly started working on a new fighting game under Riot.</p>



<p>That wasn't very surprising. Despite Stonehearth, the Cannon brothers were always more interested in fighting games than anything else; after all, they founded the <strong>Evolution Championship Series</strong> and also developed the <strong>GGPO</strong> middleware, which provided the <strong>rollback netcode technology</strong> now practically mandatory for any self-respecting fighting game with online functionality.</p>



<p>It took many years to get this new project running, though. The first confirmation that they were indeed working on a new fighting game <a href="https://wccftech.com/former-rising-thunder-devs-are-indeed-working-on-a-fighting-game-at-riot/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">came in August 2019</a>, but it wasn't until August 2022 that fans got another major update, when the developers<a href="https://wccftech.com/league-of-legends-fighting-game-project-l-goes-free-to-play-new-fighter-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> revealed</a> that it would be a free-to-play title. The game's title, 2XKO, was only announced <a href="https://wccftech.com/2xko-is-the-name-of-riots-project-l-launching-in-2025-for-pc-and-consoles/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in February 2024</a>. That's also when we learned the first actual details on the game, which is a 2v2 tag-team fighting game where players select two characters from Riot's League of Legends setting. </p>

<p>One champion starts as the "Point," while the other starts as the "Assist." Players can tag in and out to swap active fighters, creating a four-player arena. Active tagging lets you call in assists mid-combo to extend damage or set up mix-ups. Furthermore, tag-in timing is crucial to offensive flow.</p>



<p>In an attempt to improve accessibility to those who aren't well-versed in the genre, there are no traditional quarter-circle or dragon-punch motions in 2XKO; instead, champions use button combinations. Another key feature of the game is the Fuse system, a team-building customization mechanic (similar to League keystones) that grants abilities like back-to-back assist calling, increased damage at health advantage, or dual ultimates, allowing users to customize duo synergies and playstyles.</p>

        <p>“Did you lose faith in me?”</p><p>“No. I love you, onii-chan.”</p><p>Unable to bear the ugliness of the world and terrified of other people, the protagonist develops the ability to read minds.</p><p>He shuts himself away and submits a light novel he wrote, which unexpectedly wins a newcomer’s award. But the jealousy and envy that follow only deepen his distrust of the few human relationships he still has. Those around him hurt his fragile heart without even realizing it.</p><p>His only remaining comfort is his younger sister, who lives with him.</p><p>Clinging to each other just to stay alive, the two sink night after night into a twisted, unhealthy codependency.</p><p><em>—I keep living alone, talking about my own prejudices and cursing the world.

            <title><![CDATA[The State Of The Nintendo Switch 2 In 2025]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-review-metroid-prime-4-pokemon-2000656188</link>
            <guid>1394659</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>It doesn’t feel like Nintendo just released a new console. Last year around this time we were inundated with </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-leaks-reveal-release-date-reddit-1851725408"><span>weekly leaks</span></a><span> about the Switch 2. They all pointed to the same thing: it would be a bigger, more powerful version of the console we already knew and loved. Nintendo kicked 2025 off by showing us a Switch 2 that was exactly that. It launched in June to significant fanfare and hype, and there has been surprisingly little to say about the Switch 2 ever since.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>It looks lean, feels sleek, and runs older blockbusters and even some newer ones surprisingly well. But its boldest innovation is a video sharing feature that feels </span><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/no-one-will-play-uno-on-a-console-really-why-bother-looking-back-at-uno-the-xbox-live-arcade-hit-that-thrust-social-play-onto-the-360-generation"><span>plucked out of 2006</span></a><span> and which I never hear anyone talk about. The quintessential smartphone upgrade of video game consoles, the Switch 2 set launch sales records but dominated the conversation less than anyone expected.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>Nintendo’s latest flagship console doesn’t break the mold. It remains, first and foremost, a machine for playing Nintendo games, most of which are sequels to franchises that have been around since the last millennium. And it does that splendidly, even if the games themselves haven’t always cleared the lofty bar set by the Switch 1’s first year. Do I sound a little disappointed? I’m trying not to be.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>2025 was a transition year for Nintendo’s hardware; one that feels less like a clear passing of the baton than an extended farewell where everyone spends an extra 15 minutes gossipping at the door while putting on their coats before actually saying goodbye. The Switch 1 was a must-buy in 2017. In 2025 the Switch 2 is more of a nice-to-have.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <h2>The Hardware</h2> <p><span>You can tell when a certain line of hardware has matured by what people focus on. The raw specs? A refined form factor? New software features? With the Switch 2, it’s a satisfying but mostly inconsequential gimmick. One of the first things anyone will do with the new device is feel the tug of magnets as the new Joy-Con click into place on the sides of the console. A hundred times later, it still delights me and yields an unwarranted flash of joy. If only the thumb-stick nubs weren’t still garbage.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>The other thing that stands out most about the Switch 2 is how much faster it charges. While the battery life overall isn’t very impressive, and is still sapped surprisingly quickly even in sleep mode, it’s now possible to get a mostly full charge in just one hour. This isn’t a reason to upgrade a console, but it’s one of the things I spend the most time doing with my Switch 2 besides playing it.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>The screen, slightly larger than that of its predecessor, also feels surprisingly revelatory. It’s like you’ve been driving with the sun visor down and then you lift it up to reveal the rest of the horizon. The addition of those few inches of space feels like having a blast shield lifted from your face. It’s not OLED, but the resolution is sharp, the colors are vibrant, and the overall build quality feels nice. Setting HDR correctly, though, is a pain.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000656191" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000656191"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000656191">Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p><span>Most importantly, the guts of the machine delivered the type of next-gen upgrade you’d want from a device that costs $150 more than its predecessor did at launch. It kept up well with modern third-party blockbusters like </span><i><span>Cyberpunk 2077</span></i><span> and </span><i><span>Star Wars Outlaws,</span></i><span> and ran first-party Nintendo games with sprawling worlds, like</span><i><span> Mario Kart World </span></i><span>and</span><i><span> Donkey Kong Bananza</span></i><span>, with no major issues, at least in docked mode.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>The old Switch, meanwhile, is harder than ever to go back to. The screen is small, the bezels feel that much larger, and the OS lags more than my two-year-old on a one-mile walk around the neighborhood. The hardware has held up well mechanically, but is hanging off the edge of a cliff when it comes to actual game performance.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Fans have been seeing the original Switch show its age with new releases for years now, but </span><i><span>Pokemon Legends: Z-A</span></i><span> and </span><i><span>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</span></i><span> are likely to serve as the final nails in the coffin for anyone trying to stick it out on the less capable last-gen machines. Are the games busted on Switch 1? Not at all. Can you enjoy them? Definitely. Would I recommend just holding off until you eventually buy a Switch 2? Absolutely.</span></p>

 <p><span>It’s worth noting that, like the Switch 2, the original Switch also saw a price hike in 2025. It now costs $40 more than it did at launch. The used prices for the old hardware, thankfully, have remained surprisingly low. A secondhand Switch Lite for $100 was probably the best deal in games this year.&nbsp;</span></p> <h2>The Software</h2> <p><span>The Switch 2 interface remains stubbornly barebones in an era when the Xbox Series X/S and PS5 continue to add new bells and whistles to their home screen experiences. Customization options are minimal. The row of icons constantly jiggles around based solely on what you played last. Tons of blank real estate above and below is still a wasteland, with no backgrounds to swap to besides night mode.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>GameChat, the Switch 2’s actual big back-of-the-box feature, performs fine, but feels unmoored from the broader console experience. Meanwhile, the console itself can play </span><i><span>Fortnite</span></i><span>, </span><i><span>Apex Legends</span></i><span>, and </span><i><span>Minecraft</span></i><span> better than its predecessor, but compared to PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC, the Switch 2 remains just as fundamentally uninterested in being a social hub as the Switch was.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>It’s the only major gaming platform not to be integrated with the biggest communication platform for gaming: Discord. Sharing game capture and images now requires a dedicated smartphone app from Nintendo’s ever-growing repository of console features outsourced to second screens. It’s not a terrible idea in principle, but it doesn’t feel sane or streamlined in practice.&nbsp;</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000656193" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000656193"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000656193">Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p><span>2025 was the year that Nintendo tried to divorce itself from the increasingly unstable broader internet. It set up a dedicated Nintendo Today! news app that is sometimes the only place to find out about things like the upcoming </span><i><span>Zelda</span></i><span> movie, but is more often than not just a glorified calendar for sharing existing character art.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>There’s also a dedicated app for parental controls, music, and more. None of it is organically integrated into the actual device fans just spent a ton of money on. </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-store-app-music-too-many-switch-2-iphone-phone-2000641401"><span>The whole setup</span></a><span> is, frankly, insane.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>There were some bright spots for Nintendo’s on-system user-experience in 2025, however. It established virtual card sharing to allow users to lend out digital games across different devices as long as they’re linked by a family group or share a user profile. It’s a process that looks more complicated on paper than it feels in practice.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>It makes the experience of jumping back and forth between the original Switch and the Switch 2 a lot more seamless than it was with any previous generational leaps in Nintendo’s history. The only downside is that cloud save syncing can’t always keep up. It’s a step in the right direction, but still a far cry from Microsoft’s brave new “play anywhere” future.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Another bone Nintendo threw to older Switch owners was GameShare, a way to use multiplayer across multiple devices in the same room. While GameShare works online via GameChat for Switch 2 owners, it also works locally for those with the old handheld hybrid. It works surprisingly well for things like</span><i><span> Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment</span></i><span> multiplayer, streaming the game to an old Switch for player two. It runs at lower resolution and framerates, but is a nice option that adds utility to the older hardware, even if it’s probably going to stay a niche feature over the long run.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <h2>The Services</h2> <p><span>Switch Online expanded in a big way this year with the addition of GameCube games. Exclusive to Switch 2, the new classic console experience kicked off with </span><i><span>F-Zero GX</span></i><span>, </span><i><span>Soulcalibur II</span></i><span>, and </span><i><span>The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker</span></i><span> in June, followed by</span><i><span> Super Mario Strikers</span></i><span> in July, </span><i><span>Chibi-Robo!</span></i><span> in August,</span><i><span> Luigi’s Mansion</span></i><span> in October, and </span><i><span>Wario World</span></i><span> in December.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Games like </span><i><span>Super Mario Sunshine</span></i><span> and </span><i><span>Fire Emblem: Path of Radiance</span></i><span> remain MIA for now, and it’ll be interesting to see how much the library expands into third-party releases. It added a lot of value to the existing $50-a-year Expansion Pack subscription, which also gained access to paid Switch 2 upgrades for Switch games like </span><i><span>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild.</span></i></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000656192" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000656192"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000656192">Nintendo</figcaption></figure> <p><span>But one thing Nintendo didn’t do was bring back Virtual Console, or some other mechanism for buying old games a la carte. Entire months still go by without any new classics added to any of the console back catalogs. And glaring omissions like</span><i><span> Super Smash Bros. 64</span></i><span> raise questions about whether some games will ever be added to the service.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Switch Online, which is still just $20 a year, will become mandatory for GameChat access starting after March 31, 2026. At the same time, users are getting other benefits like new music in Nintendo’s Spotify-like app for game soundtracks. Practically every week gets new tracks for games ranging from </span><i><span>Metroid 2</span></i><span> to </span><i><span>Captain Toad: Treasure Tracker</span></i><span>, though obvious albums like </span><i><span>Mario Kart World</span></i><span> are still missing.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>Meanwhile, other benefits have been dropped from the service. Just in time for the new console’s release, Nintendo ditched its gold coins system that gave players cash back on eShop purchases, and is similarly sunsetting its Switch Game Vouchers program, a series of coupons that let fans get new games at a discount. Done right, it was one way to keep gaming on Switch more affordable. Instead, being a Nintendo fan is only getting more expensive amid tariffs, $80 games, and Switch 2 upgrade fees.&nbsp;</span></p> <h2>The Games</h2> <p><span>It was an eclectic year for Switch and Switch 2 releases, if not one that will be remembered like 2017, when Nintendo launched a new console into one of the best lineups in its history. </span><i><span>Mario Kart World</span></i><span> initially dazzled but doesn’t feel as full-bodied as </span><i><span>Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</span></i><span> does after years of post-release updates and DLC. Despite issuing a number of balance updates, the company has been weird about actually letting fans play the game the way they want to online.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>New add-ons for </span><i><span>Mario Party Jamboree</span></i><span> and </span><i><span>Kirby and the Forgotten Land</span></i><span> were nice upgrade incentives but hardly groundbreaking. </span><i><span>Kirby Air Riders</span></i><span>, for all of director Masahiro Sakurai’s pre-release hype, was nice, fun, </span><i><span>fine</span></i><span>. </span><i><span>Donkey Kong Bananza</span></i><span>, an unexpected highlight, provided a novel gimmick and a crowd-pleasing ending to bookend an otherwise B+ experience. </span><i><span>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</span></i><span>, despite the nearly decade-long wait, was also less than transformative.&nbsp;</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000000903" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000000903"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000000903">Nintendo</figcaption></figure> <p><i><span>Pok</span></i><i><span>é</span></i><i><span>mon Legends: Z-A</span></i><span> delivered for</span><i><span> Pok</span></i><i><span>é</span></i><i><span>mon</span></i><span> fans, bolstering what would have been an otherwise disappointing inaugural holiday season for the Switch 2, but it did not quite transform the franchise the way Switch 1 iterations of some long-standing series did. There was certainly no shortage of new Nintendo releases in 2025, from </span><i><span>Mario Galax</span></i><span>y remasters to </span><i><span>Tears of the Kingdom</span></i><span> upgrades, but nothing that quite lived up to the sky-high expectations attached to the new hardware around this time last year.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>But Nintendo has done a good job of building up the Switch 2’s initial base of third-party support. Ubisoft showed up with ports that underpromised and over-delivered, even as others like </span><i><span>Borderlands 4</span></i><span> were indefinitely delayed. </span><i><span>Cyberpunk 2077</span></i><span>, </span><i><span>Hitman: World of Assassination</span></i><span>, and </span><i><span>Street Fighter 6</span></i><span> all showed the breadth of what fans might expect heading into this new Nintendo console generation, which is access to many of the biggest modern games around, available with fewer compromises than expected, at least early on.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>If you look at the 10 highest-rated releases of the year according to Metacritic, seven of them are available on Switch and four of them, including </span><i><span>Hades 2</span></i><span>, are console exclusives. It’s not hard to see the rest, including </span><i><span>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 </span></i><span>and</span><i><span> Blue Prince</span></i><span>, eventually coming to the platform in 2026. At least for now, Switch 2 is shaping up to have a broader powerhouse library of games than its predecessor. The only real question is whether Nintendo can raise the bar again, or has hit its current ceiling.&nbsp;</span></p> <h2>The Future</h2> <p><span>There were four things that made the first year of the original Switch so special: portability, indie games, a great</span><i><span> Mario</span></i><span> game, and a groundbreaking </span><i><span>Zelda</span></i><span>. The Switch 2 benefited from none of those things in quite the same way. It still feels like we’re in the warm-up phase. Nintendo isn’t one to rest on its laurels, but it’s also looking beyond just games these days.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Nintendo’s biggest release of 2026 probably won’t be on Switch 2. If it performs as well as the first one, </span><i><span>The Super Mario Galaxy Movie</span></i><span> will, in terms of cultural reach and box office prowess, outshine anything that the company can stick on a cartridge. It opened a new Super Nintendo World theme park location in Orlando this year, and continues branching out into real-world experiences, new stores, more toys, and other transmedia products.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>The Switch 2 feels like the Switch 1 all grown up, and it is both more useful and more boring as a result. It wears a half-zip, pays its bills on time, and always shows up on time at the bar. It has its shit together. Give it your money. It’s the gaming equivalent of investing your 401k in an index fund.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>But can Nintendo still flood it with imaginative possibilities that surprise and delight the way it did with releases like Labo and </span><i><span>Ring Fit</span></i><span> on the Switch in its early years? Will it give us fresh gameplay ideas and new franchises, or reinvent the old ones to the point where they feel almost unrecognizable? That will be the test for the Switch 2 in 2026 and beyond. Especially if Nintendo is going to start charging more for it, as some analysts are </span><a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/hardware-prices-will-not-fall-industry-analysts-are-extremely-concerned-about-console-prices-wouldnt-be-shocked-if-the-nintendo-switch-2-costs-more-in-2026/"><span>currently speculating aloud</span></a><span>.</span></p> <p><span>The Switch 2 is good enough, but it still has a lot to prove. </span></p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/this-new-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-vr-mod-is-awesome-2000656152</link>
            <guid>1394575</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>There’s a new way to experience Nintendo’s fantastic <em><a href="https://kotaku.com/the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-the-kotaku-rev-1792885174">The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</a>.</em> A completely free virtual reality mod for the open-world RPG is out now, letting you hop into Hyrule like never before, and it looks amazing.</p> <p><a href="https://github.com/Crementif/BotW-BetterVR"><em>BetterVR</em> is a newly released mod</a> for the Wii U-emulated version of <a href="https://kotaku.com/how-breath-of-the-wild-helped-me-love-food-again-1842385671"><em>Breath of the Wild</em></a> that lets you play through the entirety of the game through the eyes of Link himself. You’ll need a copy of <em>Breath of the Wild</em> on Wii U, a somewhat powerful PC, the Cemu emulator, and, of course, a virtual reality headset like the Meta Quest 3. But if you have all that, you can now virtually explore <em>Breath of the Wild</em> in a whole new way.</p>

  <p>This is a fully stereo-rendered VR experience with 6DOF and no alternated eye rendering. <em>BetterVR</em> also supports full hand and arm tracking, letting you chop down trees and fight monsters by flailing around. (You can also use normal button commands if you prefer, of course.) It also features customized VR controls, like reaching behind your back to grab your sword, so it should play and feel like a native VR game.</p>

 <p>I’m not surprised this VR mod is so good. The team behind it, Flat2VR, are the same folks who created the <a href="https://kotaku.com/half-life-2-vr-mod-alyx-pc-valve-steam-gordon-freeman-1849603782">excellent<em> Half-Life 2 VR</em> mod that is as good as Valve’s very own</a><em> Half-Life: Alyx.</em> The team has also ported other games to VR and has even developed commercially released ports of titles, like <em>Roboquest VR.</em> Even with all that experience, however, making this mod wasn’t easy, as explained in a thorough writeup on the mod’s GitHub page. They had to reverse engineer a lot of how<em> Breath of the Wild</em> worked and then translate that into something that could be rendered and played in VR. The end result is impressive as heck, and I’m almost tempted to download this mod and set up an emulator to check it out. I wasn’t a big fan of <em>Breath of the Wild,</em> but maybe this would change my mind.</p>

 <p>As for how Nintendo lawyers will react to this, who can say? The project seems confident enough that it will be fine, <a href="https://x.com/Flat2VR/status/2005107315041513621">as the team has been posting about it publicly for days</a> before it launched on Tuesday. Seeing as the mod itself contains zero <em>Breath of the Wild</em> files, I’d say <em>BetterVR</em> is probably safe, but you never know with Nintendo.</p>

Its new OneXSugar Wallet is reminiscent of the company’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/report/711116/onexsugar-sugar-1-hands-on-preview-transforming-dual-screen">folding OneXSugar Sugar 1 handheld</a> that launched earlier this year. But instead of two screens, the Wallet handheld unfolds to reveal just one big 8.01-inch OLED screen with a 4:3 aspect ratio, as <a href="https://retrohandhelds.gg/onexsugar-wallet-is-first-android-handheld-with-a-foldable-screen/">spotted by <em>Retro Handhelds</em></a>.</p><p>The OneXSugar Wallet was <a href="https://weibo.com/7972483950/QkG4HEdwD">announced on China’s Weibo yesterday</a>, but with few details about its features and capabilities. That folding OLED screen has a resolution of 2480 x 1860 pixels, and the handheld will be powered by an unspecified “Qualcomm gaming platform flagship processor,” but its performance and emulation capabilities are unknown.</p><p>Based on <a href="https://weibo.com/7578408888/QkG3sFFlL?pagetype=profilefeed">photos and a video released by One-Netbook</a>, the OneXSugar Wallet will feature a standard set of controls including asymmetrical thumbsticks, four action buttons, and a D-pad situated on either side of the lower half of its display. There are also shoulder buttons and triggers on the back of the handheld and a pair of front-facing speakers flanking the top half of the screen. The biggest question is how much will the handheld cost? There are already <a href="https://www.theverge.com/report/785828/microsoft-xbox-ally-x-pricing-next-gen-consoles-report">$1,000 handheld consoles</a>, but folding screen devices like the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/795298/google-pixel-10-pro-fold-review">Google Pixel 10 Pro Fold</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/phones/701076/samsung-galaxy-z-fold-flip-7-fe-hands-on">Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 7</a> are priced closer to $2,000. Will gamers embrace the OneXSugar Wallet if it’s similarly expensive? Maybe it’s called the Wallet for a reason.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTYw"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Andrew Liszewski</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/851401/one-netbook-onexsugar-gaming-handheld-wallet-folding-oled-screen-android]]></content:encoded>

In the back halls of game conferences I hear stories of studios grumbling at the time needed to make narrative content, game directors tossing out years of work at the drop of the hat, and executives declaring that AI-driven NPCs will be more immersive than anything a human could craft.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">All workers in the game industry should be equally valued, but today I raise a toast to all my fellow writers deep in the trenches and everyone who makes great storytelling possible.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/diego-arguello-s-top-10-games-of-the-year-2025-wrap-up" target="_self" data-discover="true">Diego Arguello's top 10 games of the year - 2025 Wrap-Up</a></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Clair Obscur: Expedition 33"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.expedition33.com/overview/characters">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a><span> </span>(Sandfall Interactive/Kepler Interactive)</h2><p>Image via Sandfall Interactive/Kepler Interactive</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">made me feel like a kid again. Not out of nostalgia, but because it gloriously embodies everything that made me fall in love with video games.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Its story is over-the-top and operatic, filled with amazing characters. Its turn-based strategic play rewards experimenting with character builds.

The depth of its design and storytelling is staggering—to make it to the "final room" in the mansion is to only dip your toes into the shallows of an ocean of emotions and brain teasers.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/game-developer-s-2025-wrap-up-the-top-games-of-the-year" target="_self" data-discover="true">Game Developer's top 10 games of the year - 2025 Wrap-Up</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Beneath the brain teasers and hidden clues is a world drowning in loss and trauma—a family's tale of pain and politics drip-fed through notes buried in randomly appearing rooms and the haunting whispers of an animatronic fortune teller. It's a tale told through the process of solving puzzles, itself becoming a puzzle that your brain sorts out while you sleep.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This game is truly special, the product of someone experimenting with physical space, the player's attention span, and the politics and social dynamics of a wealthy family of an alternate Earth.

I realized it had its claws in me when I told my spouse (a fellow journalist) "Hang on a second, I need to get this story in by deadline!" Journalism isn't a topic tackled often in games—actually it's increasingly an underexplored topic across all media—and most depictions don't introduce the player to the nuances of the profession.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Not only does </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>News Tower </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">do just that, it also hides a complex simulation system worthy of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Frostpunk</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. It juggles fictionalized and real-world historical events to keep players on their toes about the kind of paper they want to run. Sure, I may have an objective to print crime stories this week, but hold up—a chance to cover the debut of Universal's Frankenstein appeared!

I relished the chance to slash at Satyrs, Wastels, and Pinheads in a quest to build the most disgusting and broken builds that would let me way waste to Cronos and the tyrannical Typhon.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Once again, Supergiant built a combat system so clever it lured me into tuning the difficulty higher and higher until my fingers cramped. Once again the jams of Darren Korb sent shivers down my spine. And to my greatest delight, once again did Supergiant reimagine the Greek Pantheon as a mesmerizing (and sometimes horny) cast of characters that I wanted to constantly learn more about.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It's the characters I keep coming back to when I think about </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Hades II</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. Encountering each new god, shade, and demigod was a reward for breaking the backs of hordes of monsters. Truly, an adventure like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Hades 2</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> isn't about the (unusually retconned) destination, it's about the people you meet along the way.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="The Outer Worlds 2"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.obsidian.net/games/the-outer-worlds-2">The Outer Worlds 2</a><span>/</span><a target="_blank" href="https://avowed.obsidian.net/">Avowed</a><span> </span>(Obsidian Entertainment/Xbox Game Studios)</h2><p>Image via Obsidian Entertainment/Microsoft</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I'm cramming both of Obsidian Entertainment's excellent role-playing games into one slot because I frankly can't pick which one compelled me more.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Avowed</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> encouraged meditation on fate, identity, and authority. </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The Outer Worlds 2</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> introduced me to a batch of companions whose journeys I found more relatable, being so rooted in the dysfunction of our real world.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">So I picked them both. Because while Obsidian again turned out a pair of narratively excellent tales (nothing new for the company), it's the technical polish on traversal and combat that bound both games together.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The company once known for ambitious-but-buggy releases has evolved its production practices so that it now can release games that blend the best of many gameplay styles. Smashing bugs, shooting guns, detonating explosives—forget the mysteries and sidequests, I wanted to keep playing because the sound of pistols, rifles, and lightning bolts was like candy across both games.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Dispatch"><a target="_blank" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2592160/Dispatch/">Dispatch</a><span> </span>(Adhoc Studios/Critical Role)</h2><p>Image via Adhoc Studio/Critical Role</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I'm generally leery of superhero stories that are "mature" riffs on the DC/Marvel dynamic, but Adhoc Studios won me over. </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Dispatch</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> is an accomplishment for the modern game development age, a game made by a studio of talented storytellers who could only execute their vision with the help of external collaborators, fighting for their lives in a business environment skeptical about narrative-first titles.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">They succeeded because their vision of a down-and-out superhero struggling to find himself in a chaotic world is such a wonderful fit for the medium. Player character Robert Robertson III captures the frustration of feeling like your life is unstable and you can't figure out how you fit amongst the people around you. The titular "dispatch" system isn't a gimmick—it's a nice bite-sized strategy game to give you a breather on the game's story.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It's infuriating that Adhoc was put through the wringer getting this game made. May its outstanding quality be a bullhorn for the game industry: players love strong interactive stories. Help teams make great ones—stop telling themselves to hold back or compromise on what makes their stories special.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Back To The Dawn"><a target="_blank" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1735700/Back_to_the_Dawn/">Back To The Dawn</a> (Metal Head Games/Spiral Up Games)</h2><p>Image via Metal Head Games/ Spiral Up Games</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I spotted </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Back To The Dawn</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> in a GameDiscoverCo newsletter mentioning surprise Steam hits—this one fueled by a Chinese audience. I checked it out. And it was magnificent?</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Few in the Western game development world probably played this one, so I urge you to seek it out. Metal Head Games cooked up a game that blends simulation and linear narrative, as players take on the role of a journalist or undercover cop racing to escape from prison in a gritty, Zootopia-inspired world filled with a pulpy cast of characters.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I admire the game not just for its structure—a fixed month-long event cycle with specific events that the player can influence—but also its tone. Prison break stories can be exploitative, either subjecting characters to horrific violence or casting prisoners as irredeemable villains. At their worst, they sand over the edges of a real-world devastating system that ruins lives and often fails to enact justice.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Back To The Dawn</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> is pulpy but laden with depth. Characters can switch from friendly to ferocious on a dime. It simulates violence without glorifying abuse or rewarding the player's basest instincts. It's a game where kindness and collaboration plays as much a role as subterfuge and blackmail. That's not an easy tone to strike—and that it came through even in localization speaks to how considerate the developers were about the difficulties of prison life.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Demonschool"><a target="_blank" href="https://necrosoftgames.com/demonschool/">Demonschool</a> (Necrosoft Games/Ysbyrd Games)</h2><p>Image via Necrosoft Games/Ysbyrd Games.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Disclaimer: Necrosoft founder Brandon Sheffield is a former Game Developer contributor and friend of the site.</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I want more games like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Demonschool</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. That's not just because I want colorful turn-based RPGs with devilish combat systems and giant skeletons (though hey, if you've got one, bring em on). It's because I want more games that so thoroughly ooze with their creators' point of view and sense of style.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/behind-i-demonschool-s-i-eye-catching-design-choices">We spoke with director Brandon Sheffield</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> last year about how the tastes of the Necrosoft team influence everything—its visuals, the combat, even the in-game reviews of real cult classic films. This game benefits from its makers being willing to wander out in the world, find weird influences, and bring them back into a turn-based tactics experience</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Doing so proves something that </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Final Fantasy Tactics: The Ivalice Chronicles</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> director Kazutoyo Maehiro </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/final-fantasy-tactics-the-ivalice-chronicles-director-explains-the-rich-storytelling-possibilities-of-strategy-games">brought up in a recent conversation with Game Developer</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">: tactics games with a wide cast of characters are a template for great storytelling. To have </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Demonschool</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> release in the same year as a remake of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Final Fantasy Tactics</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> only proves his point.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Metroid Prime 4: Beyond"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/metroid-prime-4-beyond-switch/">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a> (Retro Studios/Nintendo)</h2><p>Image via Retro Studios/Nintendo</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">All right this one is partly about nostalgia.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">From ages 14 through 17, the soundscape of a Metroid Prime game was regularly humming away somewhere in my house. Hearing those sound effects again triggered not just a return to a supposedly simpler time, but also a sensation of intensity and being overwhelmed by the enormity of a dead science fiction world.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I thought that feeling was lost—and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> brought it back.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It helps that Retro didn't abandon many solid design principles of the early 2000s games. Combat is often more of a puzzle than a test of skill. Save stations are (mostly) religiously enforced. And when the chatty Federation soldiers aren't around, the game builds mood by encouraging players to think through puzzles themselves.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The many "a-ha!" moments I've felt are still so unique to Metroid's morph balls, missiles, and mysteries. What a joy to feel 14 again.&nbsp;</span></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/game-developer-s-2025-wrap-up-bryant-francis-top-10-games]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Rainbow Six Siege is still struggling today after hackers gave out "billions" in in-game currency, forcing Ubisoft to briefly "intentionally" shut down the game.</p>
<p>While Ubisoft has not shared much of the details, players reported that the hackers banned - and unbanned - thousands of players, took control of the ban feed, gave all players 2 billion credits and renown each, and unlocked every premium skin for all players without charge.</p>
<p>Hackers then banned dozens of fake accounts "so that the usernames displayed the lyrics of Michael Jackson's Billie Jean" on-screen, as seen below.</p>
<p>While Ubisoft says the issue is now resolved, the game's service page suggests issues persist right across the board.</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>Rainbow Six Siege was hacked, and the hackers gave players billions in in-game currency.</p><p>The hackers also banned dozens of fake accounts in a sequence so that the usernames displayed the lyrics of "Billie Jean" by Michael Jackson.<a href="https://t.co/pWPFSFbwav">pic.twitter.com/pWPFSFbwav</a></p></div>— Romulus Industries (@RomulusInd) <a href="https://twitter.com/RomulusInd/status/2005150413520339315?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 28, 2025</a></blockquote></div>

<p>After <a href="https://x.com/Rainbow6Game/status/2004917731829948808">notifying</a> players of an "incident" on 27th December, the publisher "intentionally shut down" both Siege and its Marketplace "while the team focuses on resolving the issue".</p>
<p>It also confirmed that while it had rolled back erroneous transactions, "nobody will be banned for spending credits received" and reminded players that the ban ticker had been turned off in a prior update.</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><p dir="ltr" lang="en">A rollback is currently ongoing and afterwards, extensive quality control tests will be executed to ensure the integrity of accounts and effectiveness of changes.

<p>"An official R6 ShieldGuard ban wave did occur, but is not related to this incident," Ubisoft added. "We are working very hard to make sure this is resolved and players can play again.</p>
<p>"A rollback is currently ongoing and afterwards, extensive quality control tests will be executed to ensure the integrity of accounts and effectiveness of changes," the team added in a subsequent update on X/Twitter. "The team is focused on getting players back into the game as quickly as possible.</p><p>"Please know that this matter is being handled with extreme care and therefore, timing cannot be guaranteed. We will provide another update as soon as we know more. Thank you all for your patience and understanding as we continue to tackle this."</p>
<p>Then, on 28th December, Ubisoft launched a "soft launch", which only opened the game to a "small number of players only" while it completed live tests. Yesterday, 29th December, tests concluded and the game opened up to all again.</p>
<p>As a consequence, however, players experienced queues whilst connecting, and while players who didn't log in during the affected period should see no changes, those who did "may temporarily lose access to some owned items. Investigations and corrections will continue over the next two weeks".</p>
<p>The Marketplace remains closed "until further notice".</p>
<p>"We appreciate your patience as we work hard to investigate the cause of these known issues and ensure the whole community can get back to playing Siege," Ubisoft said in its latest official <a href="https://x.com/Rainbow6Game/status/2005702094913671606?s=20">communication</a>.</p>

<p>At the time of writing, however, the game's <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/game/rainbow-six/siege/status">service status page</a> suggests "unplanned" outages persist, with connectivity, authentication, in-game store, and matchmaking all listed as "degraded" or showing a complete "outage" across every single platform (PC, PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and last-gen systems). It's unclear why at this time. </p>

<hr>
<p>Many insects are matriarchal creatures. For termites, honey bees, praying mantises, ants, and spiders (shh, I know they’re arachnids), their colonies and societies are led by females or defined by female-controlled structures. They range from groups driven by female workers to matriarchs responsible for breeding and raising the entire colony.</p><div><figure data-videoid="8PPa7JzGiQE" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8PPa7JzGiQE?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="yt8PPa7JzGiQE" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/8PPa7JzGiQE?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8PPa7JzGiQE?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed61a957ogmilt&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>841k</span></a></p>

<p>So it makes perfect sense that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hollow-knight-silksong-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a> is a game governed by its women. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/hollow_knight">Hollow Knight</a> certainly embraces part of this with its true final boss in The Radiance. But from its very first encounter all the way to the finale, Silksong’s women drive the plot forward. It goes way beyond being led by Hornet, a half-spider, half-wyrm who became The Knight’s ally in the first game.</p>
<p>In Pharloom and the Citadel, a world ensnared by silk and gripped by song, women are everything. Women are guides who help Hornet and chart the corridors of Pharloom. They’re powerful keepers of knowledge who bear the history of this broken kingdom will do whatever it takes to save it. They’re mothers, sisters, daughters, family who love and have let down, who have been forgotten or driven mad. They’re people who have suffered and struggled and continue to struggle.</p>
<p>Hornet herself is the perfect hero for Silksong’s narrative, one defined by systems of oppression, of familial and generational trauma, of class divides and religious control. Initially stripped of many of her powers and skills, she struggles and climbs — physically and mentally — to the top of the Citadel, before collapsing back down to the bottom. I know I’m beating the drum of “the struggle is the point” here, but the gameplay ties so beautifully with those aforementioned themes, including womanhood, I will continue to beat the same rhythm.</p>
<figure data-uuid="ecfb1a2b1b397"><a title="Hollow Knight: Silksong Womanhood" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/ecfb1a2b1b397/hollow-knight-silksong-womanhood.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Many of Silksong's toughest challenges come in the form of female figures. The Last Judge, the notorious roadblock between the end of Act 1 and the beginning of Act 2, is among the most fearsome bosses in the game, battering you with a fiery thurible and crimson embers over and over again, in a chamber drowning in her bellowing screams and her face obscured by what looks like a tear-stained mask.</p>
<p>Then there are the Weavers – Widow and her tricks that use threads to manipulate bells and overwhelm Hornet, while First Sinner is a lightning-fast combatant who teleports and zips around the arena breathlessly. These are female figures that define Pharloom’s history.</p>
<p>It isn’t like Hornet is weak, either. She’s a powerful woman raised by powerful women; her mother is Herrah the Beast, she trained under the Hive Queen Vespa, and was mentored for a time by The White Queen. She carries that strength, displaying confidence and pragmatism while always treating everyone with respect. Even when her eventual rival, Lace, taunts her on their first meeting, she does not mock her back: <em>“Your threats are worthless, child. If you are my foe, stay your voice and raise your blade.”</em></p>
<p>Just like how Hornet contrasts The Knight, other roles filled by men or male-presenting figures in Hollow Knight are now often held by women. Shakra is a very different cartographer than Cornifer; a warrior by nature, she is hunting for her missing mentor. She’s an immense help to Hornet throughout the game, defined by so much more than her strength and her ability to map the world.</p>
<figure data-uuid="665b5377b312d"><a title="Hollow Knight: Silksong Womanhood" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/665b5377b312d/hollow-knight-silksong-womanhood.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>For one, Shakra is a woman of tradition; she is found by scattered throwing rings and the dulcet tones of her singing voice. She comes to greatly respect Hornet throughout the journey, recognising her as a fellow warrior. And even though she’s not from the inner areas of Pharloom, like Bone Bottom or the Citadel, in Act 3 she still takes up the mantle as defender of Bellhart when the Void begins to overwhelm.</p>
<p>Similarly, the Bell Beast is your Last Stag of Silksong, and she’s the complete opposite. Active, vocal, and a fan of pets, Bella (yes, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/opinion-why-focus-on-silksongs-difficulty-when-we-need-to-talk-about-how-cute-it-is">I named her</a>) comes to love Hornet because she saved her from being ensnared in silk. Even if Hornet has to knock a bit of sense into her.</p>
<p>And, like Shakra, the Bell Beast undergoes a bit of a transformation in Act 3. My heart leapt into my throat when I rang the bell at the Bellway and my trusty companion didn’t arrive, instead replaced by the Bell Eater. Luckily, I had nothing to worry about, as after confronting the monstrous centipede-like creature and struggling, the Beast emerges and takes it down. Reunited with her companion, she introduces her litter of adorable children, and the five of them sing as Hornet plays the Needolin.</p>

<p>The Bell Beast has a reason to protect Pharloom – she’s a mother. Acting as a mirror to Hollow Knight once again, which focused on failed father figures and broken families, Silksong casts a much wider net on the theme, encompassing mothers and mother-like figures from every corner of life. From the Moss Mother to the splinters and the ants, as anyone who walked into Hunter’s March early on and got battered to death knows, family and motherhood is the heart of Silksong.</p>
<p>Speaking of the ants, the once-great leader, Skarrsinger Karmelita (matriarchal ants, remember?), is among the strongest characters I faced in Silksong. Before diving into her memory, she asks Hornet, “My strength... my power... Could you claim it, pale beast? Are you so strong?...”, which is pretty apt because in her prime, Karmelita humbled me with both her aria and her battle prowess for <em>hours.</em> Given that she was the only leader who could protect her tribe from the allure of the silk (for a time) thanks to the power of her voice, her strength should be no surprise.</p>
<figure data-uuid="15dd1dca43aee"><a title="Hollow Knight: Silksong Womanhood" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/15dd1dca43aee/hollow-knight-silksong-womanhood.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>She is a mix of stereotypical masculine and feminine qualities, but her position as matriarch, as leader, is undeniable. Graceful, respectful, and with hundreds of loyal followers who support and protect her, she’s a great contrast to the aptly-named Grand Mother Silk, the figure behind all of Pharloom's ills. Where Karmelita cares about her tribe, Grand Mother wishes only to be the absolute ruler.</p>
<p>As a pale higher being who was abandoned by her “daughters” (the Weavers), Grand Mother Silk is haunting the silk and using her power to get people to worship her, driving them mad. She even goes as far as to fashion more children from silk to love her. One of those is Lace, a dutiful daughter driven mad by her desire to simply make her mother happy. She is the child of a mother who has done many bad things, burdened with the weight of those sins and the choices she has to make for her parental figure, including bringing Hornet to Pharloom to satisfy her.</p>

<p>Eventually, it drives Lace to self-loathing: If you play the Needolin during the second fight with her in The Cradle, she’ll sing <em>“Why her... Mother… See me cut! See me serve!”</em> Eventually, Lace rebels and at the start of Act 3, she cuts her mother’s arm off to free Hornet from falling into the Void. Lace instead goes down, but her mother does make one sacrifice: she cocoons Lace to protect her as best as she can, at the gradual cost of her soul.</p>
<p>Lace’s attempt at breaking free from her mother, of lashing out at her, results in her becoming dependent on her. Pharloom is still ensnared by the pale mother’s silken grip, now tainted with the darkness below. And it’s only right that Lace is saved by Hornet at the end, pulled from the Void and allowed to live freely. Lace made that choice by cutting her mother’s arm off, and Hornet allows her to see that choice through.</p>
<figure data-uuid="9bf2b4f2004f5"><a title="Hollow Knight: Silksong Womanhood" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/9bf2b4f2004f5/hollow-knight-silksong-womanhood.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Women breaking free and taking a stand happens throughout Silksong; Shakra and the Bell Beast were just two examples, and while it isn’t exclusive to women, it does feel different when framed through their struggles.</p>
<p>Even Hornet’s journey, beyond simply freeing Pharloom, is about breaking free and retaining her agency. Slapping Nuu at the first signs of approach or scolding Kratt after he spies on her in the flea spa are a few simple moments of this – ones that made me chuckle at first, but later realise just how important they were to maintaining Silksong’s respect for its female characters.</p>
<p>This respect stretches to the path to the Cursed Child ending and getting the Witch Crest. This involves putting Hornet through a horrendous experience that “curses” her after a parasite is forcibly inserted into her body. It completely changes how Hornet’s body functions and how she plays – she can’t heal, she can’t use tools, and she can’t use Silk Skills.</p>
<figure data-uuid="997510ca30c95"><a title="Hollow Knight: Silksong Womanhood" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/997510ca30c95/hollow-knight-silksong-womanhood.large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Even Grindle gets a taste of Hornet's medicine — <em><span></span> Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>With this “curse”, Hornet can either defeat Grand Mother Silk, or she can seek the help of Yarnaby, a disgraced doctor who was kicked out of Bellhart because of her practices. It’s a not-subtle story about bodily autonomy, forced motherhood, and overcoming trauma. Yarnaby, an outcast, extracts the “curse” from Hornet, which in turn gives you the Witch Crest.</p>
<p>We all know the historical connotations of the word '<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Witch_(archetype)">witch</a>', especially related to women and the persecution we (and many others) have so often faced when branded with that term. But quests like this remind us that choice is a powerful thing and, if we have the space to make a choice, we should, for we — everyone — define ourselves by our choices.</p>

<p>Without womanhood, and without its women, Silksong would be a very different game. It ties into all of the thematic riches of the narrative beautifully, and there are so many powerful women throughout Pharloom, beyond even the few I’ve talked about, such as Jubilana, Neyleth, and the Forge Daughter.</p>
<p>When I reflect on Silksong, I think about all the girls who grew up playing video games, particularly <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nes/metroid">Metroid</a>. Seeing Samus remove her suit for the first time <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2021/07/soapbox_super_metroid_showed_me_i_had_the_right_to_exist">must have been incredible</a>; I knew about this ‘twist’ before playing any game, and it still felt incredible to be playing as a woman with power and autonomy in a way few other games have since.</p>
<p>Hornet might just be “a bug”, but her journey throughout Pharloom is an important one for women. We’re not perfect beings, and Silksong isn’t shy about saying that. Hornet herself messes up in not recognising the Snail Shaman’s plans to use the Void to trap Grand Mother Silk. But she makes a choice to save these people, to liberate those who have suffered under the silken thread for so long. To free herself of the curse. To save Lace and let her live her own life.</p>
<p>Amidst the oppression of Pharloom, there is hope, there is a chance to break free. And the women will lead the charge.</p>

<p>"It's quite cool to see Larian Studios, who just did Baldur’s Gate 3, and they've said, 'we don't feel like Baldur’s Gate 4. We're just gonna do another game'. And you know, good for them.</p>
<p>"But it's a bold move. It's not obvious. It's very risky. It's easier to just keep on doing what you’re doing.</p>
<p>"The reality is if you have a studio that has one mega successful game, it just doesn't make sense to do any wild changes," he added (thanks, <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/baldurs-gate-4-larian-turned-down-rockstar-lead-respect/">TheGamer</a>), suggesting that it was tempting to "put [whatever weird ideas you have] into GTA rather than just launching an entirely new game".</p><p>ICYMI, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/lost-in-translation-larian-boss-swen-vincke-generative-ai-backlash-divinity-ama">Larian is set to host an AMA in the new year to follow up on its use of generative AI</a>, following a huge backlash earlier this month. In a statement, Larian CEO Swen Vincke stated it would be "irresponsible for us not to evaluate new technologies" and the company's successes "come from empowering people to work in their own way".</p>
<p>It follows backlash against the company after Vincke told Bloomberg <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/larian-is-using-generative-ai-confirms-ceo-but-divinity-wont-contain-anything-ai-generated">the studio is using generative AI</a>, but its newly-revealed Divinity game won't include any AI-generated content.</p>
<p>Vermeji is now working on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3044790/Plentiful/">Plentiful</a>, a sandbox god game where you can sculpt the land, redirect rivers, and guide your people "through a perilous Stone Age".</p>

              <p>2025 is almost over. The internet is full of <a href="https://kotaku.com/game-awards-2025-tga-winners-losers-who-won-game-of-the-year-clair-obscur-2000652261">GOTY lists</a> recommending dozens of stellar releases. You can find many of the games on those lists currently on sale on the PlayStation store. It’s not a bad time to catch up on that game or two you missed that everyone was buzzing about this year and see what all the fuss is about while you’re nursing that New Year’s hangover.</p> <p>Below is a quick rundown of some of the biggest releases of 2025 that are all currently discounted on PSN:</p> <ul> <li><em><strong>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</strong></em> – $35 (50 percent off)</li> <li><em><strong>Elden Ring Nightreign</strong></em> – $30 (25 percent off)</li> <li><em><strong>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</strong></em> – $40 (20 percent off)</li> <li><strong><em>Battlefield 6</em></strong> – $49 (30 percent off)</li> <li><strong><em>Arc Raiders</em></strong> – $32 (20 percent off)</li> <li><strong><em>Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</em></strong> – $50 (29 percent off)</li> <li><strong><em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em></strong> – $16 (20 percent off)</li> <li><strong><em>Borderlands 4</em></strong> – $56 (20 percent off)</li> <li><strong><em>Dying Light: The Beast</em></strong> – $48 (20 percent off)</li> <li><em><strong>Digimon Story: Time Stranger</strong></em> – $56 (20 percent off)</li> <li><strong><em>Split Fiction</em></strong> – $37.50 (25 percent off)</li> <li><strong><em>Silent Hill f</em></strong> – $42 (40 percent off)</li> <li><strong><em>The Outer Worlds 2</em></strong> – $49 (30 percent off)</li> <li><strong><em>The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered</em></strong> – $33.50 (33 percent off)</li> <li><strong><em>Final Fantasy Tactics</em></strong> – The Ivalice Chronicles – $40 (20 percent off)</li> <li><strong><em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em></strong> – $38.50 (45 percent off)</li> <li><strong><em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance II</em></strong> – $35 (50 percent off)</li> </ul> <p>Standout deals include <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em>, <em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em>, and <em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance II</em> which are all essentially half off. <em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em> is the cheapest overall on the list at $16 and probably has the best player value quotient when it comes to how many times a game can kill you without making you quit. Games that didn’t get as much fanfare in 2025, like <a href="https://kotaku.com/digimon-story-time-stranger-the-kotaku-review-2000630341"><em>Digimon Story: Time Stranger</em></a>, <a href="https://kotaku.com/outer-worlds-2-review-rpg-xbox-ps5-2000638368"><em>The Outer Worlds 2</em></a>, and <a href="https://kotaku.com/silent-hill-f-review-horror-konami-hinako-ryukishi07-2000627505"><em>Silent Hill f</em></a> are all well worth a look, too.</p>

 <p>If you didn’t catch <em>Gears of War</em>, <em>Forza Horizon 5</em>, or <em>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</em> when they launched on Xbox, they’re all on sale as well. <em>Gears of War: Reloaded</em> is $20 (half off), <em>Forza Horizon 5</em> is $36 (40 percent off), and<em> Indiana Jones</em> is $49 (30 percent off). If you’re looking for some Soulslike action, <a href="https://kotaku.com/first-berserker-khazan-review-anime-soulslike-rpg-1851771917"><em>The First Berserker: Khazan</em></a> is $42 (30 percent off) and <a href="https://kotaku.com/wuchang-fallen-feathers-gooner-souls-pc-steam-reviews-1851786856"><em>Wuchang: Fallen Feathers</em></a> is $40 (20 percent off); both of those are very good. Finally, there’s <em>Hell Is Us</em>, a sci-fi horror action-adventure about war and time-loop monsters <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games-review/767993/hell-is-us-review-ps5-xbox-steam">that’s more than the sum of its parts</a>. At just $36 (40 percent off), it’s currently at its lowest price yet.</p>

              <p>Looking to improve your gaming PC? You may need a new graphics card. The latest and greatest may be a little expensive, but you could always do with a sale-priced upgrade so you can save a bit. We found one that’s heavily discounted now, and you can not only get it for a low price, but it should do your computer some good.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6615/">You can find the SFF-Ready ASUS Prime GeForce RTX 5060 Ti 8GB GDDR7 OC Edition Graphics Card on Amazon right now for $318</a>. In comparison to the original retail price of $470, that’s a discount of $152 and represents about a 32% savings.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6615/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>A powerful GPU that can enhance all your gaming goals</h2>
<p>This ASUS Prime GeForce RTX 5060Ti is a powerful graphics card that includes all the features you’d need to play the newest games at 144Hz, do photo and video editing at high resolution, and still have room left over to run other (usually demanding) applications.</p>
<p>Based on NVIDIA Ampere Architecture, the 8 GB of GDDR7 memory will allow you to maintain high frame rates at both 1080p and 1440p resolutions with less lag. Even at higher resolutions you should be able to achieve frame rates above 60 FPS. You’ll also see lower power consumption when running with this card.</p>
<p>To support the unique demands of small form factor systems, ASUS has engineered this product to fit within most mini ITX and micro ATX enclosures. While this card does occupy two and a half slots, it’s much smaller than most other graphics cards and leaves ample room to install additional hardware inside your enclosure. It does a great job at balancing both airflow and cooling to maintain stable performance during heavy loads, and uses axial-tech fans and carefully located heat sinks to ensure that this card runs quietly and maintains low operating temperatures.</p>



<p>For the gamer, this graphics card provides a significant upgrade over both integrated and older discrete graphics cards. With this card you’ll get faster load times, smoother frame rates, and better management of modern features like ray tracing when you play supported titles. For creators, the increased memory and processing power of this graphics card will help with tasks such as video editing, 3D modeling, and multitasking, especially when your workloads require more than what a typical GPU can provide.</p>
<p>Overall, with its superior performance, compact size, and highly efficient cooling, the SFF-Ready ASUS Prime GeForce RTX 5060 Ti 8GB GDDR7 OC Edition Graphics Card is an ideal graphics card for upgrading to for many PC builds. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6615/">Given the current sale price of $318, this graphics card is an affordable option to consider if you want to increase your PC performance without spending too much money.</a></p>

            <title><![CDATA[Excuse Me, But What The Hell Is This?]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/goat-trailer-fart-joke-jackass-sony-zootopia-funny-teaser-2000656133</link>
            <guid>1394473</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Over the weekend, I went out to the theater and saw <a href="https://kotaku.com/avatar-3-fire-ash-runtime-revealed-three-hours-long-sega-outer-worlds-2-2000643471"><em>Avatar: Fire and Ash</em></a>. Even as a big <em>Avatar</em> sicko, I walked out disappointed. But I don’t want to talk about that. Instead, I want to highlight a moment I was forced to watch <em>twice</em> due to some snafu at my local AMC. The moment in question involves some children hooking up a tube to a monkey’s face and farting into the other end. Hey Hollywood, what the fuck?</p> <p>We arrived to see <a href="https://kotaku.com/avatar-3-fire-and-ash-trailer-fire-clan-james-cameron-1851787146"><em>Avatar: Fire and Ash</em></a> about 15 minutes before the movie started, and to our surprise, my wife and I noticed the trailers were already playing. Strange! We sat down and I caught a new trailer for Sony’s upcoming <a href="https://kotaku.com/zootopia-2-nick-judy-relationship-romance-abortion-comic-2000649147"><em>Zootopia</em></a> knock-off, <em>GOAT</em>, which is a basketball movie about talking animals or something. Approximately one minute and 49 seconds into this trailer, I was surprised to see two young rhino girls using a tube and a gas mask to funnel a fart from one of the animals’ asses to the face of a sleeping monkey man.&nbsp; Here’s the moment in question.</p>

  <p>I looked around the theater, which was basically empty as we’d arrived fairly early, and questioned if I’d actually seen what I thought I’d seen. I mean, sure, animated movies for kids are filled with fart jokes, so it hardly seemed impossible that Sony’s <em>GOAT </em>would feature one. But having cartoon animal kids basically recreate <a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/7c_GK40Dsjg">the fart mask stunt from <em>Jackass 2</em></a>&nbsp;as a silly moment caught me off guard. I shook it off and soon was lost in the opening minutes of <em>Fire and Ash</em>, the&nbsp;<em>GOAT&nbsp;</em>trailer a distant memory. Or so I thought.</p>

 <p>About 10 minutes later, someone seemingly complained that the movie had started early, and so the AMC restarted everything, trailers included. Mildly annoying, but it did make me giggle at all the people who had arrived late specifically to avoid trailers then being forced to watch them anyway. It also meant that I’d have a second chance to catch the fart joke. And yup, to my surprise, <em>GOAT</em> does indeed include a recreation of<em> Jackass 2’s</em> fart mask bit, complete with the victim retching and losing it.</p>

 <p>Folks, I’m not a prude. I love the <em>Jackass</em> movies. And I’m not above laughing at a fart joke or someone getting hit in the groin. But it feels like <em>GOAT </em>and the people involved were desperate to one-up all the other fart jokes in kids’ movies these days and, in the process, created something that feels like it crosses a line that I’m not even sure I can properly put my finger on. At the very least, moving forward, I’d like a warning before any trailers that feature kids recreating gross-out pranks from <em>Jackass</em> movies, okay?</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Marvel Rivals has been getting increasingly creative with its skins, but today's reveal pushes the game to a new level. Lady Loki, a female version of the god of mischief, is coming to the in-game shop later this week, complete with a new voice lines from a (presumably) new voice actor. You can see the skin in action below.</p><blockquote data-media-max-width="560"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>🐍 Lurking and ready to strike!</p><p>"The fates do have their little surprises, do they not?

While the TV series' Sylvie is a popular take on the character in her own right, Lady Loki is typically depicted as a woman with long black hair, like we see in NetEase's shooter.</p>

      <p>Lady Loki in Marvel Rivals</p>
  
</article>

<p>While past cosmetics have put filters on voice lines or included alternate sound/visual effects, this is the most transformative skin Marvel Rivals has seen to date, and raises the question of other potential character variants that could be included as cosmetic overhauls. That said, as far as I know, no one else on the roster has an alternate version as popular as Lady Loki that would require re-recorded voice lines. And I'd prefer characters who have taken up existing heroes' mantles (like Miles Morales, Shuri, or Kate Bishop) to get their own spot on the roster, rather than a reskin.&nbsp;</p><p>Future speculation aside, Lady Loki is real, but will only be available from January 2 to January 30, so if you're interested, make sure to pick her up while you can.

<p>Hej hej Felix!</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>As the new year approaches, it's the season of goodwill and change, new things and new horizons (and not just <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/animal-crossing-new-horizons-nintendo-switch-2-edition">NS2 Editions</a>), which means it's time for some news we've been sitting on for a little while. Yes, as you probably guessed from the headline, our lovely video producer Felix Sanchez is disembarking the good ship Nintendo Life.</p>
<p>Felix — gentleman, scholar, musician, Mario Party devotee, and thoroughly top chap — joined Alex and Zion <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=24mflsHQuFs">at the start of 2022</a> and has been an absolute joy to work with over the past four years. While he's moving on to work for a company in his native Denmark, you can be sure the entire NL crew will be keeping in touch with this particularly lovely person.</p>
<p>Please check out his farewell video above, where he goes into a little more detail about his next chapter. We wish you nothing but the best, Mr Felix, and we hope to catch up with you IRL soon!</p>
<p>Ah, time. Let's close out this end-of-an-era post (<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/video-after-six-wonderful-years-zion-is-leaving-nintendo-life">the second one</a> in only a handful of months, no less!) on a less-sad note: Here's 30 minutes of Felix chatting with Alex about his personal top five games of the year.</p>

<hr>
<p><em>We'll have more to announce soon on the future of the NL YouTube team (don't worry, Alex isn't going anywhere!), so keep an eye out for exciting news on the video front. Until then, we love you, Felix!</em></p></section></article><div><p>Gavin first wrote for Nintendo Life in 2018 before joining the site full-time the following year, rising through the ranks to become Editor.

			<p><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">A few years ago</strong>, no one thought the day would come when <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Bloodborne</em> would break away from its <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">PlayStation 4 jail</strong> to become playable on PC. After months of updates, the popular <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">FromSoftware</strong> hardcore action RPG is now <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">fully playable</strong> thanks to the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">ShadPS4 emulator</strong>, even on <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/bloodborne-60-fps-4gb-vram-rx-580/"><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">dated hardware</strong></a> and handheld systems like the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/shadps4-version-0-12-6-massive-performance-boost-bloodborne/">Steam Deck</a></strong>.</p>



<p>Emulation, however, still isn't perfect, as <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">online features</strong> are not accessible - but that may be about to change. A new video shared on YouTube by <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@gmoralistube">George Moralis</a></strong>, one of the emulator's lead developers, shows <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Bloodborne</em> running on PC with <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">online features enabled</strong>.</p>



<p>While this is an <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">early technical test</strong>, and many issues still need to be ironed out, it's hard not to get excited about the prospect of <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">co-op play</strong>, searching <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">glyph Chalice Dungeons</strong>, and accessing the asynchronous features such as messages and bloodstains that make FromSoftware's titles so unique. With fully <span data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">functional online features,&nbsp;<strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/dark-souls-remastered-seamless-co-op-download/">seamless co-op may also become a reality</a>,</strong>&nbsp;fur</span>ther elevating the emulated version over the original PS4 release, which can <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/bloodborne-patched-by-modder-to-run-at-60-fps-on-playstation-4-pro/"><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">only run at 60 FPS on the system with a fan-made patch.</strong></a></p>

<p>As for how <em>Bloodborne's</em> online features will function in future versions of <strong>ShadPS4</strong>, it is too early to say. According to George Moralis, the development team is <strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oqkDeWhV5g&amp;lc=Ugx0oiPx3VLoeDEw0VB4AaABAg.ARJJ8ekVjhrARJN3dkWPbQ" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">examining several options</a></strong>, including <strong>dedicated community servers</strong> or <strong>local servers</strong>. One thing, however, is certain: users playing on the emulated version will <strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4oqkDeWhV5g&amp;lc=UgzvNpnDQCtzxPeQ-fd4AaABAg.ARJM4Pn3JqpARJMu_zF1QS" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">never be able to connect to Sony's official servers</a></strong>.</p>



<p>Besides perfecting <em>Bloodborne's</em> emulation, the <strong>ShadPS4 development team</strong> is continuing to expand the list of <strong>PlayStation 4 exclusives</strong> playable on PC. More information on the emulator's progress can be found on its <a href="https://shadps4.net/"><strong>official website</strong>.</a></p>
