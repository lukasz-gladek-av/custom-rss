            <p>
Following last week's briskest of teases, Capcom has properly unveiled Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster - which is bringing its spruced up zombies-in-a-mall action to Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 5, and PC on 19th September, with a physical release to follow.
</p>
<p>
Capcom's Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster revisits the original 2006 game - in which players, as photojournalist Frank West, have three in-game days to investigate Colorado's sprawling, zombie-infested Willamette Parkview Mall - giving its slapstick action a new lick of paint.
</p>
<p>
It retains the same maximalist approach to zombie hordes and the same anything-goes approach to weaponry, but features upgraded visuals, quality of life improvements, and more. On the graphics front, Capcom's Deluxe Remaster adds enhanced character models and "evolved" mall designs featuring real-time lighting and shadow effects - giving locations a different appearance depending on the time of days. It also supports 4K resolutions at 60fps.

<p>
As far as other improvements go, there are adjustments to make controlling Frank more intuitive - players can now move while aiming, for instance - plus enhanced NPC behaviour, an auto-save feature, and a 'fine tuned' interface. Capcom says its goal with the Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster is to keep the core "unchanged" but improve on the user experience.
</p>
<p>
And if that's got you salivating at the prospect of chaotic zombie carnage, Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster will be available in two digital editions when it launches for PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and Steam on 19th September. There's the £39.99 Standard Edition, plus a £49.99 Digital Deluxe edition (yes, Capcom is releasing a Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster Deluxe Edition), which includes 17 costumes for Frank and 17 additional mall music tracks.
</p>
<p>
Capcom has also announced a pre-order bonus, with those willing to cough up for the game ahead of release getting the Dead Rising Original Pack, adding three costumes for Frank - Frank West 2006, Dead Rising 2's Chuck Green, and the Willamette Parkview Mall Bee - plus three mall tunes. A Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster physical edition arrives in November.

In early February, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/capcom-asks-players-if-they-want-sequels-to-okami-dead-rising-mega-man-and-more">Capcom posted a "Super Elections" survey</a> on its website, asking players if they would like a sequel or spin-off to its dormant franchises, such as Dead Rising, Okami, and Dino Crisis. </p><p>Dead Rising was originally released in 2006 and quickly became among the more desirable games available exclusively on the Xbox 360. The franchise ushered in a new franchise for Capcom during the late 2000s and 2010s, including three sequels. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster - Gameplay Trailer Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>The most recent entry in the franchise before the announcement of Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster was <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/dead-rising-4">Dead Rising 4</a>, released in 2016 for Xbox One and PC before <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2017/09/01/dead-rising-4-announced-for-ps4">a PS4 port</a> titled Frank's Big Package was released a year later.

Though its original gameplay mechanics remain intact, the company has confirmed that certain modern features--such as autosaves, revamped controls, and improved UI--have been added to improve the game's quality of life. It's also fully voiced, but it doesn't seem like the original voice actor, TJ Rotolo, will be reprising his role as protagonist Frank West.</p><p>Those who preorder the game will receive various costumes for Frank and some background music. They include Frank's original outfit and the Willamette Parkview Mall bee costume from the 2006 game, as well as the Chuck Greene outfit from Dead Rising 2. There will also be a physical release of the game coming in November.</p><p>The original Dead Rising game was released in 2006 for Xbox 360. It was then remastered for its tenth anniversary in 2016 for PC, PS4, and Xbox One. The series has been quite successful and spawned three additonal titles: Dead Rising 2 in 2010, Dead Rising 3 in 2013, and Dead Rising 4 in 2016.</p><p>In GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/dead-rising-review/1900-6155398/" data-ref-id="1900-6155398">Dead Rising review</a>, we said, "Dead Rising's gory, ridiculous, and entertaining action, coupled with its real-time structure and campy stylistic touches, make it one of the most unique games currently available for the Xbox 360."</p>

It focused on providing updates for only three titles: Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess, Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster, and the iOS/Mac port of Resident Evil 7: Biohazard. Here's a brief summary of each announcement, which includes the smallest of teases for the next Resident Evil title.&nbsp;</p>

<p><iframe allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TBbz12bhyE8" width="640"></iframe></p>

<h2>Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess</h2>

<p>Ahead of its launch on July 19, the fantastical action-strategy hybrid is getting a demo later today on all platforms the game is available on. The demo will also feature crossover content with Okami in the form of themed weapons and costumes for the main character and the maiden. Interestingly, the Okami stuff will only appear in the demo, but Capcom states that if enough people play it, these items will become available in the full game at launch via an update.</p>

<p><iframe allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FIAiUWhxmrs" width="640"></iframe></p>



<p>The remaster of the 2006 zombie romp is coming on September 19 (a physical version arrives in November). We got our first look at gameplay and several graphical “before/after” comparison shots showcasing how dramatic the presentational improvements really are. The game will run at 4K 60FPS and features real-time lighting that changes with the time of day. Gameplay improvements include the ability to move while aiming, an autosave feature, a better UI, and improved NPC behavior. Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster will be available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.&nbsp;</p>

</article><h2>Resident Evil 7: Biohazard on iOS and Mac</h2>

<p>The latest RE mobile port features improved touched controls and a new auto-aim/auto-fire feature for those who desire extra assistance. Menu and inventory is now touch compatible. Capcom reveals the first section of the game is free-to-play, allowing players to give it a try before committing to a purchase.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Additionally, Capcom confirms what was likely already obvious: a new Resident Evil is in development. RE7 director Koshi Nakanishi is apparently back at the helm and stated, "It was really difficult to figure out what to do after 7.&nbsp;But I found it, and to be honest, it feels substantial. I can't share any details just yet, but I hope you're excited for the day I can."</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-atari-400-mini-plays-dozens-of-classic-games-and-it%E2%80%99s-15-percent-off.916599/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/1/24190280/atar-400-mini-retro-console-deal-sale<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>It’s always worth revisiting the classics, and there’s no shortage of retro consoles and emulators to enable that. The <strong>Atari 400 Mini </strong>is more niche than we’re used to, however, and that’s what makes it so intriguing. The 8-bit retro replica console has dropped to $102 ($18 off) at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CS3VD9TJ/?tag=theverge02-20">Amazon</a> in a limited-quantity opportunity that’s nearly halfway claimed.</p><div><p>The Atari 400 Mini is a replica of the retro brand’s first home gaming console. It comes with 25 classic titles with the ability to add more, and with 720p resolution via HDMI, you don’t need to salvage an old CRT from the junkyard for your nostalgic kick.</p></div><p>The Atari 400 was one of the brand’s first home consoles and computers, noted for the inclusion of a keyboard alongside its iconic joystick. It launched in 1979, which probably explains why I haven’t heard of most of the games in the lineup (my feet touched the planet in 1988). <em>Asteroids</em>, <em>Star Raiders II</em>, <em>Centipede</em>, and <em>Berzerk</em> ring a bell for me, and I’ve even played a few of them over the years, but there are more in the list of 25 that I was simply too late for (you can find a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24113699/atari-400-mini-hands-on">full lineup in our hands-on here</a>). </p><p>It supports not just Atari 400 games but also emulates titles that launched afterward up to the Atari 5200. If you want more games, you can use one of the console’s five USB ports to sideload extras using a flash drive, provided you have digital copies of them. That port is also where you plug in the classic joystick that comes with it or keyboards, controllers, and other supported peripherals.</p><p>You can play in 720p over HDMI, either in the classic 4:3 aspect ratio that CRT sets of the era were confined to or a “pixel perfect” mode that does a fine job of scaling it for modern displays. There’s even an option to overlay your games with digital scanlines to really sell the effect. You can also rewind gameplay up to 30 seconds, and it supports snapshot saves with up to four slots per game so you never have to lose your progress.</p><p><em>The Verge</em>’s<em> </em>Andrew Webster<em> </em>felt many of the games have aged about as well as they could. Atari’s had plenty of examples to get it right, after all, with so many other retro consoles to reference such as a clone of its own <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/8/22/23841336/atari-2600-plus-compatible-with-7800-cartridges">2600</a> and similar options from long-time rivals like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23439097/sega-genesis-mini-2-astro-city-mini-v-retro-consoles">Sega</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/8/2/17642236/nes-classic-npd-sales-data-june-2018">Nintendo</a>. You could probably pass if you’re already flush with 8-bit treasure, but it’s a reasonable purchase if you’re looking for something unique and obscure for your collection.</p><div><form><div><h2>Verge Deals</h2><p> / <span>Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we've tested sent to your inbox weekly.</span></p></div></form></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

  <p id="t9z2VJ">With <a href="https://www.polygon.com/ffxiv-guides-ff14-final-fantasy-14-online/22381941/beginners-job-subscription-teleport-mount-shadowbringers-endwalker"><em>Final Fantasy 14</em></a>’s <em>Dawntrail</em> expansion comes more <strong>aether currents</strong> for players to find. These elusive collectables are scattered around the map and you’ll need to find all of them to unlock flying in their respective zones.</p>
<p id="JAnubJ">With 60 total aether currents to find, it can be a daunting task, but we’re here to help you out.</p>
<p id="I9iMPl">[<strong>Ed. note</strong>: We have tried to be considerate of <strong>spoilers </strong>in our guide. Our maps are complete so they do have the <strong>names of the zones and locations of dungeons and trials</strong>. We’ve also separated the fifth and sixth areas with a large image, as the sixth zone had not been revealed in any form (unlike the other areas, which were shown in patch notes). Don’t scroll below that image unless you’re ready to see the final area.]</p>
<hr id="gGAlDU">
<h2 id="1WIPvw"><strong>Aether currents in FFXIV, explained</strong></h2>
<p id="wmqH3c">As usual, in order to unlock <strong>flying </strong>in each new zone, you’ll need to find and<strong> interact with</strong> <strong>10 aether currents, as well as complete five quests</strong>. The four side quests required for aether currents are marked with the usual blue plus sign quest marker and the fifth quest current is a reward for finishing one of the main scenario quests in the area (usually towards the end of your stint in said area).</p>
<p id="930cyC">Usually you can use your Aether Compass in your key items to tell you how many yalms away the closest current is. If you don’t want to deal with that, you can just use our maps for an easy peasy hunt. Your Aether Compass can still be found in your “collections” menu, under the “duty” tab, if you want to find currents as Yoshi-P intended.</p>
<p id="QGthtu">We list the <em>Dawntrail </em>zones in order you encounter them, though since there are diverging paths to take, some of them, like Kozama’uka and Urqopacha, are interchangable.</p>
<p id="jRV1iN">Below we list our aether currents<strong> in the order they appear in the aether current menu from left to right</strong>, that way if you’re missing one, you’ll know which one you need without having to use your Aether Compass. That being said, we don’t recommend grabbing these in the order they’re numbered, but rather just grabbing whatever is closest to you as you adventure through these new maps.</p>
<hr id="dSU53t">
<h2 id="T47JZN"><strong>Kozama’uka aether current locations</strong></h2>
<p id="cDPub5">Note that you’ll only be able to get half of these currents on your first visit to Kozama’uka. You’ll get the other five when you return here to the southern half of the map later.</p>

The new remaster is set to update some of the textures, improve the lighting, and even add a new flashlight option, too. That all sounds good, and I’m excited to see yet another old <em>Star Wars</em> game brought to more modern platforms. However, seeing <em>Bounty Hunter </em>get the remaster treatment made me think about <em>Obi-Wan</em> on Xbox, a game that launched just a year before<em> Bounty Hunter </em>that’s still trapped on the original Xbox console over 20 years after its release. </p><p>In 2001, two years after the release of <em>Star Wars: The Phantom Menace</em>, Lucasarts released <em>Star Wars: Obi-Wan</em> as an exclusive game for the Xbox. This third-person action game starred, you guessed it, Obi-Wan Kenobi and was both a prequel to and retelling of the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/star-wars-episode-1-phantom-menace-25th-anniversary-1851489367&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/star-wars-episode-1-phantom-menace-25th-anniversary-1851489367"><em>Phantom Menace</em> film</a></span>. </p><p>It’s not a great game, to be clear. But it featured some interesting ideas—like using the right stick for lightsaber combat—and offered a fun way to experience the first <em>Star Wars</em> prequel before<em> Attack of the Clones</em> hit theaters in 2002. Besides, it’s not like<em> Bounty Hunter</em> is an incredible video game, either. Yet it’s getting a new remaster (after being released on PS4 as a PS2 classic already), while <em>Obi-Wan </em>on Xbox is left behind. </p><h2 id="h17241"><a id=""></a>How to play Star Wars: Obi-Wan in 2024</h2><p><em>Star Wars: Obi-Wan</em> never got a PC port, was never released on PS2, and has never been updated to support backward compatibility on Xbox One or Series X/S. If you want to play Obi-Wan you have one good option and one bad option. </p><p>The good option: You go buy an OG Xbox and a copy of <em>Obi-Wan</em>. Set it up and there you go, you’re playing <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars:_Obi-Wan&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Wars:_Obi-Wan" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Star Wars: Obi-Wan</em></a></span>. Well, that’s assuming the Xbox you bought works properly and the copy of the game you got isn’t too damaged. (Luckily pre-owned copies of the game aren’t very expensive, so if you have to buy two of them it won’t break the bank.)</p><p>The bad option is emulation. I love emulating games! I’m not against it at all and I think fan-developed emulators are an <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/so-called-pirates-are-doing-the-work-when-publishers-fa-1846533244&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/so-called-pirates-are-doing-the-work-when-publishers-fa-1846533244">important part of game preservation</a></span>. So when I say emulating <em>Obi-Wan</em> is bad, I want to be clear that it’s not because I’m against playing old games using third-party software. No, playing <em>Obi-Wan </em>on an Xbox emulator is bad because it sucks and is (as of this writing) not a great experience. </p><p>If you play on CXBX-Reloaded, a fan-made Xbox emulator, you might be able to make it through the game, but many players have reported crashes, graphical bugs, and other problems that spoil the experience. I’ve also tried to play Obi-Wan on XEMU, a different Xbox emulator, and had even worse luck—I couldn’t get past the second level. While some players have been able to tinker enough to get <em>Obi-Wan </em>running well on CXBX, it’s still not an ideal way to play the game. </p><h2 id="h17242"><a id=""></a>Help me Lucasfilm Games, you’re my only hope</h2><p>So now, here’s my plea: Someone at Lucasfilm Games, please contact Nightdive Studios, Aspyr, or another developer that’s good at reviving old games and pay them the money to bring <em>Star Wars: Obi-Wan </em>to more platforms. </p><p>Cleaned up and running at 60FPS, <em>Obi-Wan </em>would be a solid hit on consoles like the Switch. Plus the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/star-wars-anakin-skywalker-hayden-christensen-ahsoka-1850403820&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/star-wars-anakin-skywalker-hayden-christensen-ahsoka-1850403820"><em>Star Wars</em> prequels are currently experiencing a renaissance</a></span> among fans who grew up watching the films. Excitement for prequel-era content is at an all-time high in 2024 and I think a well-done <em>Obi-Wan</em> port or remaster would be a slam dunk. </p><p>And if that’s not possible, at the very least it would be nice to get the game ported to PC so fans can keep updating it and modding it easily for years to come. Or someone at Xbox flip the switch and make this thing backwards compatible on Xbox One and Series X/S consoles. I’d take that at this point! </p><p>But what I really want is a nice remaster. It would save a part of video game history and rescue a <em>Star Wars</em> game from being forgotten. It’s really a win-win situation and it’s about time Obi-Wan gets the remaster he deserves. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/developers-of-digital-ttrpg-fablecraft-announce-homebrew-tools</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/developers-of-digital-ttrpg-fablecraft-announce-homebrew-tools.916539/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/developers-of-digital-ttrpg-fablecraft-announce-homebrew-tools<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Last year, developer Riftweaver announced <em>Fablecraft</em> will be coming to Early Access on Steam. It is sold as a virtual tabletop TTRPG set in an original fantasy world built into a VTT platform. Now, the developer has announced that <em>Fablecraft</em> homebrew tools are in development.</p>
<h2>The <em>Fablecraft</em> Homebrew Tool Announcement</h2>
<p>The announcement of <em>Fablecraft</em> homebrew tools came in an update post on the game's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2176900/view/4254294498781880878">Steam page</a>. In the post, Riftweaver discussed the tools currently in development alongside quality-of-life improvements to the overall game experience.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/fablecraft-homebrew-music-preview.jpg?itok=-8OSCZs0 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/fablecraft-homebrew-music-preview.jpg?itok=YjHzWmS9 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Lot of bases being covered with this.</figcaption></figure><p>The post confirms the first of the <em>Fablecraft</em> homebrew tools will be homebrew music and soundscapes. As the name implies, this feature will allow GMs to upload custom music and sound effects to their game. This custom audio must be in MP3 format and can be up to 20 MB in size. Once uploaded, the tracks can be played from the Jukebox alongside official material.</p>
<p>Riftweaver also confirmed that homebrew battlemap support is coming. The post does mention this feature may not be available during <em>Fablecraft's</em> initial Early Access release, but it will be in active development. The tools will allow the upload of images, as well as walls, terrain, and measurement tools.</p>
<p>The post also hints the developers are working on tools to import battlemaps from third-party applications.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/fablecraft-homebrew-battlemap-preview.jpg?itok=fArYvi3a 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/fablecraft-homebrew-battlemap-preview.jpg?itok=CI9163kz 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Needs more gelatinous cubes, but its progress.</figcaption></figure><p>Lastly, the post discusses quality-of-life improvements coming to <em>Fablecraft's</em> Turn Tracker. It's a minor UX change for combat. When it's your turn and you don't immediately act, the tracker and your player token will flash; letting you know it is your turn to move. The tracker will also flash if the GM has paused combat.</p>
<p>Finally, the new update lets players scroll through the initiative order in the Turn Tracker. Just use your mouse wheel to see where you stand each round.</p>
<p><em>Fablecraft</em> will be available on Steam Early Access sometime this summer.</p>

But where will these new characters fall in the pantheon of the series?<br></p><p><em>Dragon Age</em>’s companions are arguably the most well-regarded thing about the franchise, as is pretty standard for BioWare games. It’s got us thinking, who are the best characters in each <em>Dragon Age</em> game? Rather than creating an unwieldy list of 30+ characters spanning the entire series thus far, we decided to break them up between games. If you missed it, we already <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-inquisition-best-characters-dorian-solas-1851559486&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-inquisition-best-characters-dorian-solas-1851559486">ranked <em>Dragon Age: Inquisition</em>’s party</a></span>. But now, let’s get to <em>Dragon Age II. </em>Here’s our ranking of those nerds from Kirkwall, from worst to best.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="560e341d06f65fda205c1195ac470f74" data-recommend-id="image://560e341d06f65fda205c1195ac470f74" data-format="jpg" data-width="1360" data-height="768" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Bethany sits on the ground next to Orsino." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Bethany sits on the ground next to Orsino." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->BioWare / Dragon Age Wiki</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="560e341d06f65fda205c1195ac470f74" data-recommend-id="image://560e341d06f65fda205c1195ac470f74" data-format="jpg" data-width="1360" data-height="768" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Bethany sits on the ground next to Orsino." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>In <em>Dragon Age 2</em>, protagonist Hawke has two siblings who act as temporary party members for the game’s first act. One will die in the opening with almost no ceremony, The other will get sidelined around ten hours in. Bethany, Hawke’s mage sister, easily gets the worst hand out of the two. She gets dragged away by the Circle in one route, becomes a Grey Warden in another, or she dies. Carver, Hawke’s warrior brother, has a similar setup, but he at least has some autonomy and drama in his branching paths. Bethany, meanwhile, is pretty much dragged through the story, with BioWare separating or killing every member of a family in a game ostensibly about familial ties. Bethany is comparatively sweet and understanding whereas her brother is decidedly neither of those things, but BioWare gave her nothing to work with.<br></p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="b1cbfef99fcb56bd35dcedfcf5db9ba0" data-recommend-id="image://b1cbfef99fcb56bd35dcedfcf5db9ba0" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Sebastian stares at something off-camera with with the bluest eyes you've ever seen.

Sure, he’s got his own storyline, struggling between whether or not he wants to be the ruler of Starkhaven as the brutal murder of his family has left him  the only living heir. But beyond that, he mostly sways in the background of the main plot, being unwaveringly devout to the church and casting judgment upon others. His biggest contributions are his companion quest, which gives returning companion Leliana a chance to appear, and when he threatens to level the entirety of the city of Kirkwall if you don’t kill a terrorist. Which like, good for standing on your principles, king. But I barely know you. You’re the tagalong friend who awkwardly weighs in from the outskirts of the circle as everyone else is chatting. Go away!<br></p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="7e3980cbab0068453bec41315ed4c647" data-recommend-id="image://7e3980cbab0068453bec41315ed4c647" data-format="jpg" data-width="1360" data-height="768" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Carver stands next to Meredith." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Carver stands next to Meredith." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->BioWare / Dragon Age Wiki</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="7e3980cbab0068453bec41315ed4c647" data-recommend-id="image://7e3980cbab0068453bec41315ed4c647" data-format="jpg" data-width="1360" data-height="768" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Carver stands next to Meredith." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Carver suffers from most of the same problems Bethany does, but his equivalent to her Circle route is what gives him the upper hand. If you choose to leave him behind on the Deep Roads expedition in <em>Dragon Age 2</em>’s first act, he will choose to join the church’s mage-oppressive military outfit, the Templars. He does this as an act of defiance against his older sibling and it plays into the tension developed throughout the first chunk of the game. After that, he is gone for most of the game much like Bethany, only showing up during climactic moments like a glorified cameo. It’s a shame.<br></p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="7c3a5a26abd413efa5d3a0c6e71edb03" data-recommend-id="image://7c3a5a26abd413efa5d3a0c6e71edb03" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Anders stands in front of Karl with his eyes glowing." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Anders stands in front of Karl with his eyes glowing." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->BioWare / Dragon Age Wiki</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="7c3a5a26abd413efa5d3a0c6e71edb03" data-recommend-id="image://7c3a5a26abd413efa5d3a0c6e71edb03" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Anders stands in front of Karl with his eyes glowing." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>The only returning companion from <em>Dragon Age: Origins </em>is inarguably the most impactful in <em>Dragon Age 2</em>. Anders is a far cry from the wisecracking apostate we met in the <em>Awakening </em>expansion—he’s now a tortured radical after being possessed by the spirit of Justice. He becomes a healer in the city of Kirkwall, growing more and more fanatical as the game goes on and he watches injustice unfold against the mages. Eventually, whether by his own fanaticism or the spirit’s influence, Anders blows up the Kirkwall Chantry, sparking a mage rebellion that changes the <em>Dragon Age </em>universe forever.</p><p>All of that makes him a compelling but divisive character. People love Anders for his tragic angst as much as others hate him for being a terrorist. In most versions of his story, I fall into the former camp. But Anders’ rivalry path, in which you can convince him to turn on and murder the mages he just sought to free, remains one of the most baffling and cowardly decisions BioWare has ever made with the <em>Dragon Age </em>franchise. It technically works within the game’s friendship and rivalry system, in which you can have a friendly or adversarial relationship with your party that can challenge their worldview, but it’s also such an irresponsible moment that is, sadly, par for the course with how <em>Dragon Age </em>tends to “both sides” issues of oppression. As the face of this conflict in <em>Dragon Age</em>, Anders inevitably has to bear the baggage of a series that has never wanted to take a side and failed to make a case for both arguments. And it undermines him and the story of <em>Dragon Age 2</em> in the end.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="d367db14a335aad6455a598f6fac6a51" data-recommend-id="image://d367db14a335aad6455a598f6fac6a51" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Varric stands with his titties out in the Hanged Man." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Varric stands with his titties out in the Hanged Man." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->BioWare / Dragon Age Wiki</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="d367db14a335aad6455a598f6fac6a51" data-recommend-id="image://d367db14a335aad6455a598f6fac6a51" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Varric stands with his titties out in the Hanged Man." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Good ol’ Varric Tethras’ debut established him as a fan favorite and acted as a springboard for him to be one of the longest-running characters in BioWare’s fantasy series. The dwarven storyteller starts out as a humble businessman looking for a business partner only to get dragged into unprecedented times as the city of Kirkwall becomes a center point for worldwide change. Varric’s ties to the city run deep, but as he becomes estranged with his family, he finds a new one in Hawke and the others. In the end, he’s left alone as the others flee the city, and he stays behind to tell their story to anyone who will listen. It’s funny to think about how what he has to deal with here is like child’s play compared to the places he would go in <em>Inquisition </em>and will go in <em>The Veilguard</em>. But his greatness has small beginnings, and he’s only become greater since we met him as Hawke in <em>Dragon Age 2</em>.<br></p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="08bfbe9dcfcd9b923ffc599d1ae301e8" data-recommend-id="image://08bfbe9dcfcd9b923ffc599d1ae301e8" data-format="jpg" data-width="900" data-height="506" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Fenris strikes an enemy down with his sword.

" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Fenris, the lyrium-infused elven ex-slave from the land of the Tevinter Imperium, approaches <em>Dragon Age</em> <em>2</em>’s mage problem as someone who has been the victim of the worst crimes magic can cause in this world. He’s been made into a living weapon at the behest of his mage master, and lost his family, memory, and almost all of his sense of self before escaping to Kirkwall. It’s only natural he’s dismissive and untrusting of mages. If you press him on this, he comes to see the issues with lumping every mage into the same pile as the slavers he knew in Tevinter. Fenris is one of the best examples of how <em>Dragon Age 2</em>’s friendships and rivalries can diverge in life-altering ways, and the delicious angst that comes with romancing him as rival mage Hawke is unmatched. He operates on an extreme in a game that sometimes has trouble dealing with the nuances of the conflict it centers on, but his relationship is most rewarding when you try to help him see the gray in between the black and white.<br></p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="ca570dcd0d3638367c8443472bdf1472" data-recommend-id="image://ca570dcd0d3638367c8443472bdf1472" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Aveline holds her sword with a distressed expression." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Aveline holds her sword with a distressed expression." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->BioWare / Dragon Age Wiki</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="ca570dcd0d3638367c8443472bdf1472" data-recommend-id="image://ca570dcd0d3638367c8443472bdf1472" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Aveline holds her sword with a distressed expression." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Kirkwall’s Captain of the Guard is probably the most grounded of <em>Dragon Age 2</em>’s companions. She’s not a radical mage, a swash-buckling pirate on the lookout for her next adventure, or a blood mage consorting with a demon. Aveline’s just a woman trying to get by and comfortably sleep at night. She starts as a member of the City Guard before her sense of honesty kicks in and she uncovers corruption in her ranks, leading to her ascending to the role of Captain. But even as she climbs the ladder of city defense, her story doesn’t escalate in scale, instead staying endearing and lowkey. Some of the most memorable moments in <em>Dragon Age 2</em> are the quiet ones away from all the political strife, and Aveline’s painfully awkward attempt at courting her husband-to-be remains an incredible sequence that perfectly pulls off how even the strongest among us can be as vulnerable and clumsy as anyone else. She is a woman of multitudes, the beating heart of Hawke’s team, and a shining beacon for the idea of using what time you have in this life to do right by others.<br></p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="e068ed121e2d35cfc97f1ee9fa14b562" data-recommend-id="image://e068ed121e2d35cfc97f1ee9fa14b562" data-format="jpg" data-width="3200" data-height="1800" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Isabela holds a dagger in bed." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Isabela holds a dagger in bed." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->BioWare / Dragon Age Wiki</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="e068ed121e2d35cfc97f1ee9fa14b562" data-recommend-id="image://e068ed121e2d35cfc97f1ee9fa14b562" data-format="jpg" data-width="3200" data-height="1800" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Isabela holds a dagger in bed." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Conversely, Isabela starts out as a scheming pirate who is so cool you want to be like her when you grow up. The rogue is cunning, promiscuous, and a bit brash, but she is also one of the series’ best-written companions. Isabela is always found at the Hanged Man bar, tossing back drinks&nbsp;and ready to read anyone around her to filth, but she is nurturing, wise, and loyal to a fault…if you help her get there.</p><p>Isabela can leave the party if she and Hawke aren’t close enough by the end of Act 2, but if you’ve either shown that you’re just as much a free spirit as she is or have berated her for the errors of her disloyal ways, she shows back up in a big damn hero moment ready to save the day. Then you have to fight for her life (or give her up, if you’re a bastard) and it’s all very romantic. While Isabela is technically an optional companion in <em>Dragon Age 2</em>, her actions play a big part in the setup for the political turmoil happening in Kirkwall. When she’s not there, her absence is felt, and when she is there, she makes sure everyone knows she’s the star of the show. </p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="91fa709745775ff1d0e3dfaebb5cae32" data-recommend-id="image://91fa709745775ff1d0e3dfaebb5cae32" data-format="jpg" data-width="1366" data-height="768" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Merrill sits at a table with candles lit and a book in front of her." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Merrill sits at a table with candles lit and a book in front of her." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->BioWare / Dragon Age Wiki</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="91fa709745775ff1d0e3dfaebb5cae32" data-recommend-id="image://91fa709745775ff1d0e3dfaebb5cae32" data-format="jpg" data-width="1366" data-height="768" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Merrill sits at a table with candles lit and a book in front of her." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Across BioWare’s catalog, there probably isn’t a character with more emotional range than Merrill, the Dalish blood mage. When Hawke first meets her, she seems young and innocent, but it becomes clear she’s viewed in contempt by her elven clan. It becomes clear shortly after that she has been working with a demon and using the much-reviled blood magic. Even as she casts spells that would be taboo elsewhere in the world, she is still somehow one of the most light-hearted and humorous characters in the entire series. Merrill is the sweetest character in Hawke’s crew, even as she is berated by just about everyone else for her “crimes” of using blood magic. Though it would be easy to make her come off like an abused puppy, she is steadfast in her decisions, as she believes she can use this magic for the good of the Dalish people by restoring a piece of their history.</p><p>Merrill’s conviction leads her and those around her down devastating paths, and her story is one of the most frustratingly complex situations Hawke deals with in their story because every decision and outcome feels painful for everyone involved. Ultimately there is no happy ending for someone who consorts with demons, nor for people who distrusted her so much that they couldn’t let her face the consequences. But Merrill is subversive, tragic, and somehow, still a joy to know.</p><hr><p><em>Dragon Age 2</em> was always the most divisive game in BioWare’s fantasy series, but <em>The Veilguard </em>seems to draw pretty heavily from it. It has an action-oriented approach, brings back <em>DA2</em>’s three-route dialogue system, and slims down the party. Overall, it looks like it’s learning some of the right lessons from the 2011 RPG. We’ll see if its characters live up to this merry band of misfits when <em>The Veilguard </em>launches this fall.<br></p></div></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>From the official tournament website, you can purchase tickets to watch the entire match live from the Credit Union of Texas Events Center in Allen, Texas. There will also be a number of watch parties where you can watch the event live from the comfort of your home.</p>



<p>Of course, the official Call of Duty YouTube channel often co-streams the entire event. It’s much easier and more accessible that way!</p>



<hr>



<p>While you watch eSports on one screen, why not play <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-the-first-descendant-multiplayer-answered/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The First Descendant multiplayer</a> on the other?

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Elden Ring: Shadow Of The Erdtree DLC Review</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">When Shadow of the Erdtree launched last month, the mod wasn't available because much of the game had changed. Yui needed to ensure that the mod would be the latest build of the game. Now, co-op saves made with the mod can be taken into the expansion, and for the first time ever, it now supports invasions. Players can even fight the Evergaol bosses together now.</p><p dir="ltr">The same moderator shared another message on behalf of Yui on how the new Scadutree Fragment won't affect those using the mod.</p><p dir="ltr">"The DLC has added many new mechanics, interesting edge cases and underlying code changes⁠--some of which would seem mundane to the player⁠--but have required new solutions for them to work correctly," The moderator said. "Fortunately, the Scadutree Fragments and Revered Spirit Ashes are very much localized and do not require any special synchronization."</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/eldenring/mods/510" rel="nofollow ">Click here</a> to download the seamless co-op mod. However, it is worth mentioning that even though the mod is live, it still has some issues, including not carrying important files. If that happens, users may have to redownload it from<a href="https://github.com/LukeYui/EldenRingSeamlessCoopRelease/releases/tag/v1.7.2" rel="nofollow "> Yui's Github page</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">For more Elden Ring news, check out<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/george-r-r-martin-offers-cheeky-response-to-elden-ring-film-rumors/1100-6524609/"> our story detailing George R.R.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/grab-3-months-xbox-game-pass-ultimate-for-under-35-at-woot.916500/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/deals/2024/7/1/24190165/xbox-game-pass-ultimate-pc-deal-sale-woot<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="pIwII5">For existing <a href="https://www.polygon.com/best-games/22372750/best-game-pass-games-xbox">Xbox Game Pass subscribers</a> and newcomers alike, Woot has a deal that will get you over 20% off the usual price. Now through the end of the month — or “until sold out,” per Woot’s page — you can pick up <a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-8836599-13142092?url=https%3A%2F%2Felectronics.woot.com%2Foffers%2Fdigital-code-xbox-game-pass-ultimate-1" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank" has-subtag="true" data-cdata="{&quot;rewritten_url&quot;:&quot;https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-8836599-13142092?sid=___pl__p_23954206__m_m-placeholder__s_s-placeholder__t_w__c_c-placeholder__r_r-placeholder__d_d-placeholder\u0026url=https://electronics.woot.com/offers/digital-code-xbox-game-pass-ultimate-1&quot;,&quot;subtag_max_length&quot;:64,&quot;subtag_delim_length&quot;:3,&quot;subtag_key&quot;:&quot;sid&quot;,&quot;subtag_data&quot;:{&quot;sid&quot;:&quot;___pl__p_23954206__m_m-placeholder__s_s-placeholder__t_w__c_c-placeholder__r_r-placeholder__d_d-placeholder&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://electronics.woot.com/offers/digital-code-xbox-game-pass-ultimate-1&quot;},&quot;encode_subtag&quot;:false}">three months of Xbox Game Pass Ultimate</a> for $34.49 (23% off the $44.99 list price) or one month for $11.79 (saving 21% off the usual $14.99 price). </p>
<p id="iF5O14">If you wanted to stock up for a full year (ie. buying four three-month codes) that’d set you back around $138, which in turns saves around $42 from the usual price. Put another way, that’s buying 12 months of Game Pass Ultimate for the cost of nine months. Note that there’s a limit of 24 codes per customer, so for those that want to go <em>all out</em>, you can enjoy a discounted Game Pass membership from now until July 2030. Maybe that’s overkill, but we’re not ones to judge.</p>

<p id="a9LhQf">Xbox Game Pass Ultimate is the top tier of Microsoft’s games subscription service, which allows you unlimited access to a very, very large catalog of games on both Xbox and Windows PC, as well as discounts on titles you want to add to your permanent collection. The Ultimate tier also offers EA Play membership for a selection of that publishers’ catalog, including trials of select games for up to 10 hours each, and access to Xbox Cloud Gaming — perfect for when you’d rather just jump into a game without waiting for a download. Also great if you’d rather play on a not-Xbox device, including mobile and <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24187316/xbox-amazon-fire-tv-partnership">(soon) a Fire TV stick</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/let-me-solo-her-beats-erdtree-final-boss<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">"Holy crap, my fingers are actually trembling"</h2></div><section><p>The Elden Ring community's favorite folk hero, Let Me Solo Her, has finally completed the Shadow of the Erdtree DLC, after a streaming marathon spanning multiple days during which he struggled repeatedly against the DLC's final boss.</p><p><strong>Warning: Spoilers for the ending of Shadow of the Erdtree follow below!</strong></p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">The Final boss is kicking my butt rn <a href="https://t.co/nf4htyip9T" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/nf4htyip9T</a></p>— Let me solo her (@TsuboiKlein) <a href="https://twitter.com/TsuboiKlein/status/1806845328932454784?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">June 29, 2024</a></blockquote> <p>Tsuboi Klein, also known as Let Me Solo Her, has been steadily working his way through the new Elden Ring DLC, Shadow of the Erdtree with the rest of us. Just yesterday, he finally crossed the finish line, defeating Promised Consort Radahn <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mHhR8K2g3No" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">live on stream</a> after something in the vicinity of 74 attempts. Despite being thought of as something of an Elden Ring expert, Let Me Solo Her really struggled with the second coming of Radahn, only defeating him after several hours of attempts spaced out <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qsn2dDyfVUA" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">over two days</a>. </p><p>"Holy crap, my fingers are actually trembling right now," he said upon victory. "I'm shaking."</p><p>Let Me Solo Her rose to notoriety by offering his summon sign to players struggling to beat the most difficult boss in the base game, Malenia. Wearing nothing more than a pot on his head, Let Me Solo Her has defeated Malenia hundreds of times now on behalf of others. While it might be natural to expect him to breeze through the DLC with skills like that, it's worth noting that Let Me Solo Her got so good at Malenia by practicing her fight <em>a lot</em>. It took him over 200 attempts just to beat her the first time. So it's only natural he'd get good at Radahn with practice, too. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>So is Let Me Solo Her going to master Radahn and help others defeat him now? Probably not just yet. Let Me Solo Her acknowledged at the end of his stream that he had somewhat beelined his way to Radahn and hadn't finished a lot of the other DLC boss fights, so he wants to go back and wrap things up first. He also wants to enjoy the DLC a bit off-stream, too, just for himself. Additionally, he's already been <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-rings-let-me-solo-her-is-now-let-me-solo-him-with-dire-consequences-for-messmer-the-impaler">spending his time helping others beat Messmer</a>, another story-required boss fight that many are struggling with. He's even technically rebranded as "Let Me Solo Him" just for that fight. Let Me Solo Her will continue to assist other players with Messmer for a bit longer, he says, before moving on to helping people with Radahn.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I BEAT THE FINAL BOSS LET'S GOOOOOOOOOO <a href="https://t.co/XUxVmAUitB" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/XUxVmAUitB</a></p>— Let me solo her (@TsuboiKlein) <a href="https://twitter.com/TsuboiKlein/status/1807193376594534652?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">June 29, 2024</a></blockquote> <p>We <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/let-me-solo-her-elden-ring-community-hero">interviewed Let Me Solo Her</a> two years ago during the height of his fame, and can confirm that he's delightful not just in battle against Malenia and Radahn, but also to speak with. And we <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-hero-let-me-solo-erdtree-dlc-reaction-malenia">caught up with him again</a> ahead of the release of Shadow of the Erdtree to hear his plans for exploring the Land of Shadow.

Lure Modules and Incense will last for three hours rather than their usual durations, and players will earn double the usual amount of candy for catching Pokemon. On top of that, any eggs that are placed into an incubator during the event will hatch at a quarter of the distance they typically require.</p><p>Finally, Tynamo's final form, Eelektross, will be able to learn a special event-exclusive attack during July's Community Day. Any Eelektrik that you evolve until 10 PM local time will learn the electric-type Fast Attack Volt Switch upon evolving.</p>

According to Monaghan, while he played some games from time to time as a kid, it wasn’t something he cared much about, instead preferred to play outside or act on stage. But then he moved to Los Angeles in 2002,3 and a faithful conversation with fellow <em>Lord of the Rings</em> star Elijah Wood changed everything.  </p><p>“I said to my friend Elijah Wood, it sounds like I’m terribly name-dropping right now, I said I’m going to go buy a DVD player, you want to come with me,” said Monaghan. “And Elijah’s like, you should buy PlayStation 2. So I was like all right fine,  but I’m just only going to watch <em>The Sopranos</em> on it and I’m only going to watch this and that and <em>Oz </em>and all these kinds of things. He’s like fine.”</p><p> But then a friend of his brought over a copy of <em>Grand Theft Auto 3</em>, Rockstar’s incredibly popular and controversial open-world action game set in Liberty City. And according to Monaghan, he could not “believe that games” had got this advanced. <br></p><p> “I love little things about <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/gta-3-rockstar-games-jak-ii-simpsons-hit-and-run-1851217338&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/gta-3-rockstar-games-jak-ii-simpsons-hit-and-run-1851217338"><em>GTA 3</em></a></span><em>, </em>like you can steal any car as opposed to there are certain cars that show you that they’re stealable,” explained the <em>Lord of the Rings</em> actor. “I got really good or I felt like I got really good at driving. You get to that point where everything starts to go really fast. I kind of enjoyed that. But I think [<em>GTA 3 </em>on PS2] was the big turnaround for me where I was like, oh I didn’t realize that games have now got to this point.” </p><p>“The leap was just extraordinary and you know the soundtrack is incredible. All the options were incredible,” said Monaghan. The actor further explained that since then he now includes games as part of his entertainment options alongside movies and TV shows. </p><p>As for the most recent entry in the franchise, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/grand-theft-auto-v-the-kotaku-review-1324730770&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/grand-theft-auto-v-the-kotaku-review-1324730770">2013's <em>GTA V</em></a></span>, Monaghan has played the game and enjoyed it, even if he felt like Michael—one of the three main playable characters in that installment—was a bit “obnoxious.” He also sometimes enjoyed playing as Trevor, but admitted that he sometimes felt “dirty” after stepping into the lunatic’s shoes, saying he felt like he “needed a shower” afterward. </p><p>As for his all-time favorite gaming experience, it’s not <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/gta-iii-made-just-vibing-in-its-world-incredible-1847929103&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/gta-iii-made-just-vibing-in-its-world-incredible-1847929103"><em>GTA 3</em></a></span><em> </em>but instead <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/the-elder-scrolls-v-skyrim-the-kotaku-review-5860518&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/the-elder-scrolls-v-skyrim-the-kotaku-review-5860518">The <em>Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim.</em></a></span> According to Monaghan, he put around 350 hours into the massive open-world RPG on PS3.

That's extremely evident in the character creator, where players begin their journey in Veilguard. It's easily the best character creator in series history and possibly the most robust I've ever seen in a video game. From hundreds of sliders and options to customize your player-controlled Rook to the ability to pick pronouns separate from gender and more, this character creator speaks directly to the inclusivity of Veilguard – <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/exclusive/2024/06/13/a-deep-dive-into-dragon-age-the-veilguards-expansive-character-creator">read about my in-depth look at the character creator here</a>.&nbsp;</p>

<p>But that feeling doesn't end in the character creator. It also extends to the world – ice mage and private detective companion Neve Gallus has a prosthetic leg, for example – and in the way you can play Veilguard.&nbsp;</p>

</article><p>Before starting the game proper, a playstyle screen allows players to customize various options affecting how Veilguard plays. Here, you can select difficulty, or playstyle as BioWare calls it, with options like "Storyteller" for those interested more in the story versus the combat, "Adventurer" for an experience that seemingly balances story and combat, and a difficulty called Nightmare – there might be more, but this is all I see during my demo. At any point during Veilguard, you can change the game's difficulty unless you select Nightmare, which is the hardest of difficulties. That's a permanent selection.&nbsp;</p>

<p>There's another difficulty option called Unbound, though, allowing players to customize their gameplay experience to their liking. You can adjust how wayfinding helps you in-game; there's aim assistance and even an auto-aim option. You can adjust combat timing to make parrying easier or harder, with a balanced, forgiving, and a third harder option. You can change how much damage your enemies do to you, and how much damage you do to enemies by adjusting their health. There's also an option to adjust enemy pressure. And, if you're not interested in death-related setbacks, there's a no-death option you can turn on.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"[None of these options] are a cheat," Busche tells me. "It's an option to make sure players of all abilities can show up."&nbsp;</p>

<p>She also says players can look forward to similar accessibility and approachability options you might expect, though I'm unable to pour through Veilguard's other options to confirm exactly what's there.&nbsp;</p>

But this curiosity may turn to confusion when trying to decide between the extremely generous, no-cost <em>Free Trial </em>and the paid <em>Starter Edition</em>, which will run you $20. The <em>Free Trial</em> and <em>Starter Edition</em> of <em>FF14 </em>are two different products with several distinctions. And while the <em>Starter Edition </em>is the full version of the game with zero restrictions, there is one major drawback to purchasing it: <strong>The </strong><em><strong>Starter Edition</strong></em><strong> requires a subscription to play after 30 days.</strong> Notably, the <em>Free Trial</em> does not.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195519" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="I Didn’t Play Final Fantasy XVI ‘Right,’ And That’s OK" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="148" data-playlist="195519,196626,195371" data-current="195519"><div><p>I Didn’t Play Final Fantasy XVI ‘Right,’ And That’s OK</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195519/195519_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195519/195519_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195519/195519_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195519/195519_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21013.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>This guide will help you weigh the pros and cons of each version and will discuss why the <em>Free Trial</em> is the way to go for brand new players.</p><h2 id="h15935"><a id=""></a></h2><h2 id="h15936"><a id="startedition101"></a>What comes with the $20 <em>FF14 Starter Edition</em>?</h2><p>For $19.99, <em>Final Fantasy 14: Starter Edition</em> includes the base game, 2013’s <em>A Realm Reborn</em>, and the first two expansions, 2015’s <em>Heavensward </em>and 2017’s <em>Stormblood.</em> This version lets you level your character up to level 70.

Given the beefy content provided, you stand to save quite a bit of money going this route, all to play through the same game. Once you purchase the <em>Starter Edition your </em>account is locked out of the free trial, and into a subscription.</p><p>And if you’re on Xbox, you have an additional cost-saving benefit to choosing the free trial. Game Pass Core, which Xbox requires to play online, is needed for the paid version of <em>Final Fantasy XIV</em>. However, those on the<em> Free Trial </em>bypass the Game Pass requirement and do not need any service or subscription. Since Game Pass Core starts at a monthly rate of $9.99,<em> Free Trial </em>users on Xbox are potentially saving almost $25 per month.</p><p><strong>Read More: </strong><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-14-xbox-open-beta-beginners-guide-1851274862&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-14-xbox-open-beta-beginners-guide-1851274862">A <em>Final Fantasy XIV</em> Beginner’s Guide For Xbox</a></span></p><p>The <em>Free Trial</em> does have some limitations, however. These mostly concern social aspects of the game. <em>Free Trial</em> players can not join Free Companies,<em>FFXIV’s</em> versions of guilds. <strong>They also can not create a party, but are able to join one if they are sent an invite from a player who is on a paid version</strong>. The <em>Free Trial</em> also restricts trading with other players as well as sending in-game letters or participating in PVP or Ultimate Raids. A full-list of restrictions can be found on Square Enix’s site <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://support.na.square-enix.com/rule.php?id=5382&amp;la=1&amp;tag=freetrial&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://support.na.square-enix.com/rule.php?id=5382&amp;la=1&amp;tag=freetrial" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a></span>, but these are the ones of most concern.</p><h2 id="h15938"><a id="startereditionwhatgood"></a>So…what’s the <em>Starter Edition</em> good for?</h2><p>You might be wondering: Who should buy the<em> Starter Edition</em> of the game? Well, if you have completed everything the <em>Free Trial </em>has to offer, and are ready to move on to the <em>Shadowbringers</em> expansion, you will need a paid version of the game (ie: the <em>Starter Edition</em>) and the new <em>Dawntrail</em> expansion. Every <em>FFXIV </em>expansion<em> </em>includes all the previous releases. With <em>Shadowbringers </em>and <em>Endwalker</em> now removed from digital storefronts, purchasing <em>Dawntrail </em>is the correct (and only way) to get caught up on the game.</p><p><em>Final Fantasy 14 </em>is one of the most popular MMOs of all time, and for good reason. Between its engrossing story, rewarding character building, and challenging dungeons, there is plenty of content to sink your teeth into. The heart of this experience is available for free as long as you avoid purchasing the<em> Starter Edition</em>. New users need to be aware of this before they even download the game. Once an account gets linked to a paid version like the <em>Starter Edition</em>, it is locked out of the free trial forever (much like this poor writer’s account).</p><p><em>FFXIV </em>players will have plenty of months where they will be paying to fuel their new and exciting hobby. So the longer those payments can be delayed, the better.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Gaming on PC opens a world of new possibilities, with players not only able to alter and change the game but also how they play it. Elden Ring, a highly acclaimed action role-playing game developed by FromSoftware, is one of the best examples of players using alt controllers to play the game, with people beating bloodthirsty bosses with a dance pad, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/shadow-of-the-erdtree-streamer-brainwaves/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">brain waves</a>, morse code, and so much more. Interestingly, a player recently beat Shadow of the Erdtree’s final boss with just a saxophone.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If you are living under a rock, you may have missed that some players have had a terrible time with Shadow of the Erdtree, thanks to its incredibly challenging gameplay. This accomplishment is even more commendable as beating the Elden Ring expansion’s final boss is no easy feat. </p>



<p>The man who was able to accomplish this feat is Dr. Doot, a player known for his unique approach to gaming challenges and his love for the saxophone. He has already completed a <a href="https://x.com/DrDeComposing/status/1775115963043807269" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">no-hit run on Elden Ring </a>with the same instrument.&nbsp;</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Everyone was telling me how utterly impossible the Final Boss of Shadow of the Erdtree was going to be. Outrageous moveset, impossible dodges, etc</p><p>…</p><p>It only took me a dozen attempts on the saxophone.</p><p>THE WORLD'S FIRST (afaik) ALT CONTROLLER DLC RUN HAS BEEN DOOTED!🎷 <a href="https://t.co/nUzPmfgsNx">pic.twitter.com/nUzPmfgsNx</a></p></div>— Dr. Doot 🎷 (@DrDeComposing) <a href="https://twitter.com/DrDeComposing/status/1807715780345364850?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 1, 2024</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>If you see the video embedded above, Dr. Doot’s weapon of choice was an attacking shield, The Carian Thrusting Shield specifically. You can see how Doot uses a bunch of notes on the saxophone to parry each of Radahn’s attacks until he is finally able to vanquish him, and it is a sight to behold. </p>



<p>Doot also provided some data on the shield he used to beat Shadow of the Erdtree’s final boss. Doot scaled The Carian Thrusting Shield’s STR stat by making it heavy and used Deflect Tear along with a Guard Counter Boost talisman to make the weapon “an absolute powerhouse of a tank”.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Shadow of the Erdtree launched on Friday, June 21 and sold<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/shadow-of-the-erdtree-sales/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> 5 million copies </a>within the first three days. </p>

<p>One of the most anticipated movies of 2024 is scheduled to release this month, and it seems Call of Duty might be looking to capitalize on that hype. Deadpool and Wolverine hit theatres on July 26, and we will see the action heroes descending in Call of Duty Modern Warfare 3, Warzone and Warzone Mobile.</p>



<p>As spotted by <a href="https://dotesports.com/call-of-duty/news/cod-dataminers-think-theyve-found-evidence-of-a-mw3-deadpool-wolverine-collab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Dot Esports</a>, a user called <a href="https://x.com/crashfty/status/1806747826413539737" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Crashfty</a> recently posted some peculiar videos on X (formerly Twitter) reminiscent of our beloved Merc with a mouth. The videos showcase new finisher moves for Call of Duty, with stock models enacting the scenes. Interestingly, the depicted scenes show a person killing off another in a very goofy and jovial manner, something that Deadpool is very good at. On the other hand, Wolverine hasn’t been hinted at in any of the scenes.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Marvel collaborations are a no-brainer for games, and Fortnite is the biggest example. Moreover, the potential Deadpool and Wolverine collaboration is a significant event, as it not only sees Hugh Jackman return to put the super suit back on but will potentially help with the revival of the recently degrading Marvel Cinematic Universe. Call of Duty’s next seasonal update seems like the best window to introduce this collaboration, as it begins around the same time as the movie’s release date on July 24.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other news, Call of Duty’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-dutys-fallout-update-goes-live-tomorrow/">Fallout update</a> went live last week. What do you think about Deadpool and Wolverine arriving in Call of Duty games? Let us know in the comments.</p>

  <p id="yugZzI">If you’re in the States, then this week is July Fourth. If you’re not in the States, then this week is just July 4 — congrats to all who get to mark the day however they are, wherever they are! No surprise, but: I think we should all celebrate by watching TV. Particularly if you’re in for anime, there’s a <em>lot</em> of premieres this week on Crunchyroll, meaning you can roll right through the long (or regular!) weekend with a blitz of new programs. </p>
<p id="Dkcuag">Here’s the best new TV premieres (and just a <em>few</em> of the anime previews) this week. </p>


<hr id="IF1ehv">
<h2 id="fs6TI9"><strong>New shows on Netflix</strong></h2>
<h3 id="jRZLpn"><strong>Star Trek: Prodigy</strong></h3>
<div id="Wb6nvn"><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zXh5TLAeJqw?rel=0" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share;"></iframe></p></div>
<p id="OHuQK7"><strong>Genre: </strong>Star Trek (animated YA adventures edition)<br><strong>Release date: </strong>July 1, with all episodes<br><strong>Showrunner/creator: </strong>Kevin and Dan Hageman<br><strong>Cast: </strong>Brett Gray, Ella Purnell, Jason Mantzoukas, and more</p>
<p id="IlizaR"><em>Prodigy</em> has survived cancellation (read: was in production for season 2 when it got axed by Paramount) and has jumped over to a new network (read: was subsequently picked up by Netflix). That means that if you liked what <em>Prodigy</em> was putting down in season 1, you will probably like it when it makes its way to Netflix. </p>
<h2 id="zr2b1L"><strong>New shows on Max</strong></h2>
<h3 id="46yTmB"><strong>Hard Knocks: Offseason with the New York Giants</strong></h3>
<div id="SPt5ue"><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0ccDBPrqmKE?rel=0" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share;"></iframe></p></div>
<p id="SkYi8h"><strong>Genre: </strong>Docuseries, sports drama<br><strong>Release date: </strong>July 2<br><strong>Cast: </strong>The players and staff of the New York Giants</p>
<p id="enGoPW">The New York Giants are entering their 100th season. It’s quite an accomplishment, but they (like all NFL teams) won’t settle for anything less than a Super Bowl slot. Will they get it? Who’s to say — but now we can at least watch what they’re saying during the offseason. </p>
<h2 id="YKj9EM"><strong>New shows on Crunchyroll</strong></h2>
<h3 id="oEPLsj"><strong>Nier: Automata Ver1.1a season 2</strong></h3>
<div id="ITwfSp"><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/eIMZYgb85xg?rel=0" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share;"></iframe></p></div>
<p id="nsCPWJ"><strong>Genre: </strong>Sci-fi action<br><strong>Release date: </strong>July 5, with one episode<br><strong>Studio: </strong>A-1 Pictures</p>
<p id="ffOrD3">Fans of the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2017/12/12/16754720/nier-automata-best-games-2017"><em>Nier: Automata</em></a>, rejoice: The gorgeous anime adaptation of the hit game is finally making its return this summer with a second season following the first’s protracted and troubled development. Hopefully A-1 Pictures has ironed out all the details for this new season so we won’t be waiting <em>weeks</em> or even <em>months</em> between episodes.</p>
<p id="iNmSxy">The second “cour” (the term for a production block of anime averaging between 10 and 14 episodes) will pick up immediately after the first, with 9S having learned the shocking truth behind Project YoRHa after defeating the alien robots Adam and Eve alongside 2B. We’ll have to wait until July 5 to see just how much <em>Nier: Automata Ver1.1a</em> will diverge from the story of the original game. <em>—Toussaint Egan</em></p>
<h3 id="Ns8Z2k"><strong>Tower of God season 2 </strong></h3>
<div id="8lqkLh"><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5H9U6SugSzk?rel=0" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share;"></iframe></p></div>
<p id="8GKeWq"><strong>Genre: </strong>Fantasy action<br><strong>Release date: </strong>July 7, with one episode<br><strong>Studio: </strong>The Answer Studio</p>
<p id="SL7UF5">There’s a (in-universe) six-year gap between seasons here, and while we’ll be following up with Bam, Rachel, and the rest of the season 1 crew — along with their rankings! — season 2 is also bringing in some new protagonists. Meet Wangnan and Jyu, who are a little more advanced in the tower’s levels than we’ve seen so far. Time to find out what new challenges this mysterious tower can bring!</p>
<h3 id="9A6Q7J"><strong>My Deer Friend Nokotan</strong></h3>
<div id="Q3VaJ8"><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Bf4XTzeUBHo?rel=0" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share;"></iframe></p></div>
<p id="4YATsO"><strong>Genre: </strong>Slice-of-life comedy<br><strong>Release date: </strong>July 7, with one episode<br><strong>Studio: </strong>Wit Studio</p>
<p id="mhc8St">Based on the 2019 manga by Oshioshio, <em>My Deer Friend Nokotan</em> is a comedy that centers on the misadventures of Torako Koshi, a former “yankee” (see: delinquent) girl trying to keep up her appearance as a ideal student at her new high school. That becomes significantly more difficult after she saves Noko Shikanoko, a self-described “deer-girl hybrid” who begins to follow Torako around and get up to all sorts of shenanigans.</p>
<p id="jDdkAQ">The trailer looks ridiculous, with realistic CG depictions of deer juxtaposed with Noko’s chibi-like appearance. There’s even a cute callback to the ending of <a href="https://www.polygon.com/animation-cartoons/2020/5/25/21265521/nausicaa-of-the-valley-of-the-wind-studio-ghibli-movie-watch-meaning-manga">1984’s <em>Nausicaä of the Valley of the Wind</em></a>, with Noko being lifted above a marching herd of deer while surrounded by an aura of light. We’ll see how the actual series holds up when it premieres this weekend. <em>—TE</em></p>
<h3 id="pobboo"><strong>Wistoria: Wand and Sword</strong></h3>
<div id="zY5RHO"><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FNiBiXXeyb8?rel=0" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share;"></iframe></p></div>
<p id="IEjowk"><strong>Genre: </strong>Fantasy action<br><strong>Release date: </strong>July 7, with one episode<br><strong>Studio: </strong>Actas, Bandai Namco Pictures</p>
<p id="sCovAx">Based on the fantasy adventure manga by author Fujino Ōmori and illustrator Toshi Aoi, <em>Wistoria: Wand and Sword</em> centers on Will Serfort, a young student who enrolls at a prestigious magic academy with hopes of achieving his dream of becoming one of the most powerful magic users in the world. However, much like <em>My Hero Academia</em>’s Izuku Midoriya or <em>Solo Leveling</em>’s Sung Jin-woo, Will has a critical roadblock: He can’t cast even the simplest of spells to save his own life! </p>
<p id="qm3ivW">That’s not gonna stop him, though, as he descends into the dungeons beneath the school to slay vicious monsters as an alternate way to earn academic credits. He’s like <em>Naruto</em>’s Rock Lee, only instead of being terrifyingly proficient in taijutsu, he’s an absolute beast when it comes to sword fighting.</p>
<p id="HqwaBK">I’m not familiar with the source material myself, but I am intrigued by the fact that Tatsuya Yoshihara, who previously worked as the action director on 2022’s <em>Chainsaw Man</em> and the chief director on the final season of <em>Black Clover</em>, is the director on <em>Wistoria: Wand and Sword</em>. Which means, at the very least, audiences can expect some exquisite action sequences. <em>—TE</em></p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/xdefiant-season-1-patch-notes-released.916419/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/xdefiant-season-1-patch-notes-released/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>Ahead of its launch on July 2, <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/game/xdefiant/news/39Z5ARUSNbU1QcQD0yhthI/y1s10-patch-notes">Ubisoft has released</a> the full patch notes for Season 1 of XDefiant. This new season features a new game mode in Capture the Flag, additional factions, maps, weapons, and more.</p>



<p>There’s a lot going into the first season of the game. You can check out everything for yourself below.</p>



<h6>RELATED: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xdefiant-players-launch/">Ubisoft Confirms XDefiant has had 11 Million Players Since Launch</a></h6>



<h2 id="h-full-xdefiant-season-1-patch-notes">Full XDefiant Season 1 Patch Notes</h2>



<h3>Gameplay</h3>



<ul>
<li>Changed the expiration timing of activated Boosters so their lifespan counts down only during match time, when you’re actually playing, rather than all the time, like when you’re folding laundry or whatever.</li>



<li>Lowered the XP threshold for each Battle Pass tier to give Battle Pass progression a little more pep.</li>



<li>Tuned Match Bonus XP rewards:&nbsp;MVP and Victory went from 2,000 to 1,000 XP.&nbsp;Draw went from 1,000 to 500.&nbsp;Completion doubled from 2,000 to 4,000 to encourage player&nbsp;stick-to-itiveness.</li>



<li>Answered a community ask to add a headshot icon to the Killfeed because it feels good to rub it in.</li>
</ul>



<h3>Factions</h3>



<ul>
<li>Added the GSK faction and their no-nonsense announcer: HQ.
<ul>
<li>These elite Team Rainbow operators from Germany’s Border Protection Command&nbsp;specialize in crowd control and securing territory.&nbsp;They can deploy electrified barbed wire for area denial, counter incoming enemy devices with their Active Defense System, and dazzle multiple foes with flash charges mounted on their G52-Tactical Shield ultra.&nbsp;Call them&nbsp;Grenzschutzkommando because it’s fun and also accurate.</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li>Increased the cooldown of Echelon’s Intel Suit from 30 to 40 seconds.</li>



<li>Tuned the cooldown of the Phantoms’ Mag Barrier from 30 to 40 seconds. Mag Barrier hit points were also reduced from 500 to 400.</li>



<li>The Phantoms’ AEGIS now takes damage from EMP grenades (lob six to put it out of commission).</li>



<li>DedSec Hijack cooldown decreased from 28 seconds (plus the remaining duration of&nbsp; the hacked skill) to 20 seconds (plus the remaining duration of&nbsp; the hacked skill).
<ul>
<li>For example, let’s say a Mag Barrier has 7 seconds left and gets hacked: The cooldown becomes 20 plus 7 seconds. Failed Hijack cooldown, meanwhile, decreases from 8 to 5 seconds.</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li>DedSec’s Spiderbot cooldown increased from 25 to 40 seconds.</li>



<li>Adjusted Spiderbot behavior so multiple Spiderbots won’t attempt to hug the same face, nor will Spiderbots continue to ignore faces they’ve hugged multiple recent times. Some give and take from the Spiderbot kingdom.</li>



<li>Decreased the cooldown of Libertad’s BioVida Boost from 25 to 20 seconds.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Fixed Libertad’s Medico Supremo so it will no longer disappear after the deploying player respawns as a different faction.</li>
</ul>



<h3>Maps</h3>



<ul>
<li>Added the new Clubhouse map, a two-story hangout popular with international operators. Ideal for firefights in the short- to mid-range. Home to game modes Domination, Occupy, Hot Shot, and the new CTF.</li>
</ul>



<h3>Game Modes</h3>



<ul>
<li>Added Capture the Flag, hereafter referred to as CTF. For the uninitiated: You take the enemy’s flag from their base and bring it back to your own, while protecting your team’s flag. CTF is available on a variety of maps.</li>
</ul>



<h3>Weapons</h3>



<ul>
<li>Improved the hit flinch penalty incurred when being shot with a sniper rifle equipped.<p>These changes are intended to refine the behavior of hit flinch, prevent instances where the camera would move off the target with the first hit and back onto the target with the second, and improve the experience for players sensitive to wild camera movements. Here’s the nitty-gritty:
</p><ul>
<li>The speed of the hit flinch camera transition has been increased by 25 percent.</li>



<li>The camera will now always kick upward rather than up or down at random.</li>



<li>The amount the camera will kick left or right has been increased by 3 times.</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li>Added the L115 sniper rifle, which is not quite as heavy as the TAC-50 and has faster handling, although it deals slightly less damage and is not as effective at penetrating cover.</li>



<li>Added the LVOA-C,&nbsp;a snazzy customized rifle similar to the M4A1. It has a much faster rate of fire than the M4A1, but with that comes more recoil and less range. It also has slightly longer reload and equip times.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Added the Sawed Off secondary weapon.&nbsp;This close-range version of the double-barreled shotgun packs a big boom for its size. Imagine carrying a primary weapon in your secondary slot and that’s this.</li>



<li>Added new Mastery skins: Titanium Violet (unlocked at Weapon Level 300), Titanium Azure (unlocked at 350), and Titanium Prisma (unlocked at 400).&nbsp;</li>



<li>Fixed weapons and optics shake in first-person view while using ADS.</li>
</ul>



<h3>Devices</h3>



<ul>
<li>Added a new and improved visual effect for the flash grenade (replacing the previous effect, which was…intense). The new effect is less retina-searing but still appropriately disorientating.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Removed an exploit where players could respawn with multiple devices after fiddling with the “Copy Loadout” option in the lobby, so nice try.</li>
</ul>



<h3>Social</h3>



<ul>
<li>Added the Creator Code program, which allows players to choose a creator to receive commissions from their XCoin purchases at no additional cost. Choose “Support a Creator” from the store to see a list of eligible creators.</li>



<li>Players were able to create a party with enemy players and voice chat during matches despite being on opposing teams, which seemed shady so that’s fixed.</li>



<li>Disabled whispers in text chat.</li>
</ul>



<h3>Audio</h3>



<ul>
<li>Tweaked the mix of in-game voices and sound effects for volume and clarity.</li>
</ul>



<h3>Miscellaneous</h3>



<ul>
<li>Players who participated in the Closed Beta were supposed to keep Kersey’s Dungaree skin. They didn’t but now they do.</li>



<li>Fixed Challenge-tracking issues with Ubisoft Connect.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Graphical and audio fixes, various.</li>



<li>Additional crash fixes.</li>
</ul>

      </div>
<p dir="ltr">The Season 4 battle pass ends on July 24, meaning that's likely the start of Season 5 and would make for a very well-timed crossover if the leaks are true, as the new Deadpool &amp; Wolverine movie releases in theaters on July 26.</p><p dir="ltr">Call of Duty has introduced several major IP event crossovers in the last few years, including the recent collaborations with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fallout-collab-arrives-in-call-of-duty-mw3-and-warzone-this-week/1100-6524372/">Fallout</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/videos/warzone-modern-warfare-iii-official-gundam-mobile-suit-bundles-gameplay-trailer/2300-6464213/">Gundam</a>, Dune, and The Walking Dead, so another major collaboration wouldn't be surprising.</p><p dir="ltr">We'll likely learn more about upcoming bundles and potential crossover events closer to Season 5's release. Activision is also hosting the Call of Duty: Next event on August 28 to reveal new details and showcase live gameplay of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-release-date-beta-and-more-leak-ahead-of-xbox-showcase/1100-6524072/">Black Ops 6</a> multiplayer.</p>
