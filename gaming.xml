<p>When you want to enjoy the casualness of a single-player game and inject a bit of the chaos, togetherness, and realness of an online multiplayer title, co-op is your best friend. 2026 is already shaping up to be another amazing year for co-op gaming, and this list has picked out the ones you need to wishlist and eventually install.</p>



<p>Nothing beats a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-co-op-games-for-family-this-holiday-season-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">co-op game</a> done right. Enjoying the thrills and spills of an action game alongside someone else, or piercing your partner’s eardrum with a banshee-like screech, tackling a horror game in fear. It’s the best of both worlds, and the gaming space isn’t short of fun local and online cooperative journeys to undertake.</p>



<p>2026 is looking more stacked than a heavyweight prizefighter, and it’s no slouch where co-op games are concerned. Here are eight bona fide co-op contenders to keep an eye on.</p>



<h2 id="h-biggest-co-op-games-releasing-in-2026">Biggest Co-op Games Releasing in 2026</h2>



<h3 id="h-reanimal">Reanimal</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Image from THQ Nordic</figcaption></figure>



<p>Tarsier Studios is doing what it does best in 2026 with its new IP—<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/reanimal-has-officially-gone-gold-two-months-before-release/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Reanimal</a>—focusing on co-op multiplayer in isolated and claustrophobic environments, leaving playable protagonists more vulnerable than a defrosted chicken fillet in the reaches of a cat. Expect to see many of the flourishes and fear-inducing traits that made Little Nightmares a hit, but with the introduction of less-linear sections.</p>



<p><strong>Release Date: February 13</strong></p>



<h3 id="h-lego-batman-legacy-of-the-dark-knight">LEGO Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to Traveller’s Tales</figcaption></figure>



<p>Lovers of Arkham games or Batman in general need to have May 29, 2026, circled on the calendar. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/lego-batman-legacy-of-the-dark-knight-release-date-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">LEGO Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight</a> was an unbelievable experience at Gamescom 2025, and this could easily be in certain GOTY conversations come the end of the year. It deviates from traditional LEGO games and literally goes <strong>full Arkham City and Arkham Knight with an open-world Gotham</strong>, featuring Rocksteady’s trademark free-flowing combat system. Do you know the only thing better than all of this? It has two-player local co-op for crime-fighting dynamic duos.</p>



<p><strong>Release Date: May 29</strong></p>



<h3 id="h-the-duskbloods">The Duskbloods</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to Nintendo</figcaption></figure>



<p>Even now, people are shocked that <strong>The Duskbloods is a Nintendo Switch 2 exclusive</strong>. The power of the Switch 2 has opened significant doors for Nintendo, and FromSoftware has capitalized on this with The Duskbloods. Its gothic, dystopian world embroils the player in a dangerous PvPvE setup. If you feel lonely or have a tingle of trepidation heading into the demanding ARPG, you should be able to charge foolishly into combat with a teammate.</p>



<p><strong>Release Date: 2026</strong></p>



<h3 id="h-halo-campaign-evolved">Halo: Campaign Evolved</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Image from Xbox</figcaption></figure>



<p>343 Industries has confirmed that Halo: Campaign Evolved will go off the beaten path here and there in this fully-fledged remake of the 2001 classic. It brings to life a single-player adventure in a bygone era where campaigns were considered the lifeblood of the experience more, rather than the sad afterthought they’ve become in many shooters. The message has also been made very clear that there will be no online multiplayer, but co-op is definitely in!</p>



<p><strong>Release Date: 2026</strong></p>



<h3 id="h-pokemon-pokopia">Pokémon Pokopia</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Image via Nintendo</figcaption></figure>



<p>Pokémon really is coming for everyone and everything, isn’t it? Card games, RPGs, casual photo-taking games, and The Pokémon Company have licensed most types of gaming experiences. One that hasn’t been done and makes complete sense is an Animal Crossing-style Pokémon game. What was that, you’re looking forward to it? Ditto. Oh, we’re not agreeing, it’s just that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/leaks-confirm-pokemon-pokopia-post-apocalyptic-fan-theory/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pokémon Pokopia</a> lets you be a Ditto adopting the form of a human, and it’s better not to ask questions. The main question is whether Pokémon Pokopia has co-op play, and the answer is an emphatic yes, with <strong>four-player co-op possible</strong>.</p>



<p><strong>Release Date: March 5</strong></p>



<h3 id="h-nioh-3">Nioh 3</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to Team Ninja</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Nioh might be the best Soulslike franchise not made by FromSoftware</strong>. There, it’s been said. Nioh and Nioh 2 honestly don’t get the love that they deserve. They’re ultra-clean and snappy, and the sequel evolves and keeps itself on an even keel with the outstanding first outing. Rise of the Ronin was a fun if uninspired effort to do something different, and Wo Long is also familiar, but Team Ninja’s Nioh world is unmatched. Team up with a co-op partner for Nioh 3’s upcoming barrage of mythological bosses, looking to end you, let you live, then end you again.</p>



<p><strong>Release Date: February 6</strong></p>



<h3 id="h-forza-horizon-6">Forza Horizon 6</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Image via Playground Games</figcaption></figure>



<p>We’ve only been privvy to one reveal trailer at present, but it goes without saying that Forza Horizon 6 is going to be mega—sorry, メガ! The sixth entry takes us to Japan, and while we’ve explored a lot of historical Japan in recent years with Sucker Punch’s ‘Ghost’ games, Assassin’s Creed Shadows, and more, a modern-day racing game drifting around the sacred lands of Hokkaido&nbsp;and&nbsp;Tokyo should be sensational. If it has online co-op like FH5, it should hit top speed no problem.</p>



<p><strong>Release Date: 2026</strong></p>



<h3 id="h-crashout-crew">Crashout Crew</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to Aggro Crab</figcaption></figure>



<p>No doubt, 2026 will have the usual array of Steam indie games that take everything by storm. REPO was a great example of this with its manic multiplayer gameplay, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/peak-devs-announce-a-new-co-op-title/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Peak</a> was just as good and as fun. Developer Aggro Crab has already signalled its intention to support Peak, and the team is also working on Crashout Crew. As Steam says, you must: “Work together in online co-op with up to 4 players to fulfill orders of increasingly chaotic, physics-based boxes. Time is money, and safety is no concern… just try not to crash out!”</p>

<p>Fortnite continues to get bigger and better with regular drops of new content, including major collabs, but there are still some major features missing from the Epic Games title which need to be introduced in 2026.</p>



<p>From updates that would improve a host of different modes, to additions that are major quality-of-life changes, Insider Gaming presents seven big features that Fortnite needs to introduce in 2026.</p>



<h2 id="h-fortnite-features-needed-in-2026">Fortnite Features Needed in 2026</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Survival. Image via Epic Games</figcaption></figure>



<h3 id="h-quest-mode">Quest Mode</h3>



<p>Every player has surely been in a situation where they land at a POI to complete a marked story quest, with the intention of solely interacting with an NPC, only to be attacked by a rival player and eliminated before they can tick off the task.</p>



<p>While that’s part and parcel of a Battle Royale mode, sometimes you just want to advance the story and see what’s cooking in the background narrative, but there’s currently no option to do that. Even when you land safely, it’s often a case of button-bashing to quickly advance dialogue before you are attacked.</p>



<p>Adding a quest mode with the removed risk of being attacked by rival players would be a major addition, even if it didn’t award XP for completing them, or even providing a recap in the main menu for players to experience what’s going on.</p>



<h3 id="h-customizable-hud">Customizable HUD</h3>



<p>It’s remarkable that Fortnite is so far into its lifespan without customizable options for the HUD, and that simply must change in 2026 to give players more ability to control their experience.</p>



<p>While this could be limited in ranked modes and tournaments to ensure a fair playing field, there’s no reason why players shouldn’t have the ability to adjust how things look on their HUD, and adding customization features would be a big move.</p>



<h3 id="h-destructible-terrain">Destructible Terrain</h3>



<p>Fortnite’s destruction mechanics are among the best in the business, with considerable improvements already being made in the recent The Simpsons mini-season with smashable windows without having to break down an entire wall, which remained for Chapter 7, but there’s still scope for more.</p>



<p>Currently, destroyed items are removed entirely, and no matter what you do to the landscape, it remains the same. Tweaks would make for a more interesting approach, with explosions, for example, leading to pits being made in the ground, and fallen trees remaining to hide behind.</p>



<h3 id="h-rideable-animals">Rideable Animals</h3>



<p>Fortnite has seen a wealth of travel mechanics added in the past, from vehicles to boats, planes to gliders, but more life should come to the Fortnite island, and rideable animals is a much-needed addition.</p>



<p>There’s easily scope for this to arrive in Chapter 7, which is themed on Hollywood and the west coast of the USA, with the introduction of horses a potential addition for a Wild West POI or environment fitting perfectly into the theme of the chapter.</p>



<p>We’ve seen limited-time rideable creatures and similar introduced to Fortnite in the past, but it’s time for permanent additions to be added.</p>



<h3 id="h-ai-ally-controls">AI-Ally Controls</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Direct. Image via ShiinaBR</figcaption></figure>



<p>Recruiting an AI-NPC has long been a feature of Fortnite’s Battle Royale scene, with collab characters and others available on the map to provide support, but there are limitations with this and, more often than not, they can become a real hindrance and give away your position.</p>



<p>Adding AI controls to provide directions would be a huge boost, allowing players to direct the AI to open fire, move to a different position, or hide away. If this was added in 2026, it would improve the recruitable NPCs dramatically.</p>



<h3 id="h-bot-lobbies">Bot Lobbies</h3>



<p>Long rumored to be on the cards for Fortnite, but still yet to be seen, are bot lobbies, where players can enter a game filled entirely with AI opponents, if they’d rather not face off against other players online.</p>



<p>A bot lobby would be the perfect place for younger players to enjoy Battle Royale modes for the first time, and would provide all players with the opportunity to try out different weapons and approaches without the risk of seeing their plans thwarted by rival players.</p>



<p>Capping XP in the lobby would prevent it from being exploited for those just seeking to complete the Battle Pass swiftly, and there’s the scope for this mode already considering that bots are already widely present across multiple modes.</p>







<p>Fortnite is an extremely social game, and having a hub for players to hang out in would be a great addition for 2026, and we’ve already seen it used for multiple in-game events, so it’s way overdue for a permanent addition.</p>



<p>A social hub could provide direct access to a host of game modes, with the ability to squad-up with other players you encounter, and mini games could also be available to pass the time.</p>



<p>Having the social hub available in the lobby for players would also be a huge addition, particularly when you’re waiting for an AFK friend to return.</p>

<p>When we put together our top 20 games of last year, we specifically called out <em>Civilization 7</em>, <em>Avowed</em>, <em>Doom: The Dark Ages</em>, and <em>Grand Theft Auto 6</em> as big franchise games we were already looking forward to for 2025. While one of those games has been delayed into 2026, the three others made this year’s list of Ars’ favorite games as expected. They join a handful of other highly anticipated sequels, ranging from big-budget blockbusters to long-gestating indies, on the “expected” side of this year’s list.</p>
<p>But the games that really stood out for me in 2025 were the ones that seemed to come out of nowhere. Those range from hard-to-categorize roguelike puzzle games to a gonzo, punishing mountainous walking simulation, the best G<em>eometry Wars</em> clone in years, and a touching look at the difficulties of adolescence through the surprisingly effective lens of mini-games.</p>
<p>As we look toward 2026, there are plenty of other big-budget projects that the industry is busy preparing for (the delayed <em>Grand Theft Auto VI</em> chief among them). If next year is anything like this year, though, we can look forward to plenty more games that no one saw coming suddenly vaulting into view as new classics.</p>

<p>When I was younger, I wanted—and expected—virtually every game I played to blow me away with something I’d not seen before. It was easier to hit that bar in the ’90s, when both the design and technology of games were moving at an incredible pace.</p>
<p>Now, as someone who still games in his 40s, I’m excited to see that when it happens, but I don’t expect it, Now, I increasingly appreciate games that act as a sort of comfort food, and I value some games as much for their familiarity as I do their originality.</p>
<p>That’s what <i>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</i> is all about (<a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/04/assassins-creed-shadows-is-the-dad-rock-of-video-games-and-i-love-it/">as I wrote</a> when it first came out). It follows a well-trodden formula, but it’s a beautifully polished version of that formula. Its world is grand and escapist, its audio and graphics presentation is immersive, and it makes room for many different playstyles and skill levels.</p>

<p>If your idea of a good time is “be a badass, but don’t think too hard about it,” <i>Shadows</i> is one of the best <i>Assassin’s Creed</i> titles in the franchise’s long history. It doesn’t reinvent any wheels, but after nearly two decades of <i>Assassin’s Creed</i>, it doesn’t really need to; the new setting and story are enough to separate it, while the gameplay remains familiar.</p>

<h2><em>Avowed</em></h2>

<p>No game this year has made me feel as hated as <i>Avowed</i>. As an envoy for the far-off Aedryan empire, your role in <i>Avowed</i> is basically to be hated, either overtly or subtly, by almost everyone you encounter in the wild, semi-colonized world of the Living Lands. The low-level hum of hatred and mistrust from the citizens permeates everything you do in the game, which is an unsettling feeling in a genre usually characterized by the moral certitude of heroes fighting world-ending evil.</p>
<p>Role-playing aside, <i>Avowed</i> is helpfully carried by its strong action-packed combat system, characterized as it is by thrilling moment-to-moment positional jockeying and the juggling of magic spells, ranged weapons, and powerful close-range melee attacks. The game’s quest system also does a good job of letting players balance this combat difficulty for themselves—if a goal is listed with three skull symbols on your menu, you’d best put it off until you’ve leveled up a little bit more.</p>
<p>I can take or leave the mystical mumbo-jumbo-filled subplot surrounding your status as a “godlike” being that can converse with spirits. Aside from that, though, I’ve never had so much fun being hated.</p>

<h2><em>Baby Steps</em></h2>

</a> The term “walking simulator” often gets thrown around in some game criticism circles as a derisive term for a title that’s about nothing more than walking around and looking at stuff. While <em>Baby Steps</em> might technically fit into that “walking simulator” model, stereotyping it in that way does this incredibly inventive game a disservice.</p>

          
                  </div>

<p>It starts with the walking itself, which requires meticulous, rhythmic manipulation of both shoulder buttons and both analog sticks just to stay upright. <i>Super Mario 64,</i> this ain’t. But what starts as a struggle to take just a few short steps quickly becomes almost habitual, much like learning to walk in real life.</p>
<p>The game then starts throwing new challenges at your feet. Slippery surfaces. Narrow stairways with tiny footholds. Overhangs that block your ridiculously useless, floppy upper body. The game’s relentless mountain is designed such that a single missed step can ruin huge chunks of progress, in the proud tradition of <i>Getting Over It with Bennett Foddy</i>.</p>
<p>This all might sound needlessly cruel and frustrating, but trust me, it’s worth sticking with to the end. That’s in part for the feeling of accomplishment when you do finally make it past that latest seemingly impossible wall, and partly to experience an absolutely gonzo story that deals directly and effectively with ideas of masculinity, perseverance, and society itself. You’ll never be so glad to take that final step.</p>

<h2><em>Ball x Pit</em></h2>

<p>The idea of bouncing a ball against a block is one of the most tried-and-true in all of gaming, from the basic version in the ancient <i>Breakout</i> to the number-filled angles of <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1268370/holedown/"><i>Holedown</i></a>. But perhaps no game has made this basic concept as compulsively addictive as <i>Ball x Pit</i>.</p>
<p>Here, the brick-breaking genre is crossed with the almost as storied shoot-em-up, with the balls serving as your weapons and the blocks as enemies that march slowly but relentlessly from the top of the screen to the bottom. The key to destroying those blocks all in time is bouncing your growing arsenal of new balls at just the right angles to maximize their damage-dealing impact and catching them again so you can throw them once more that much faster.</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>Like so many roguelikes before it, <i>Ball x Pit</i> uses randomization as the core of its compulsive loop, letting you choose from a wide selection of new abilities and ball-based attacks as you slowly level up. But <i>Ball x Pit </i>goes further than most in letting you fuse and combine those balls into unique combinations that take dozens of runs to fully uncover and combine effectively.</p>
<p>Add in a deep system of semi-permanent upgrades (with its own intriguing “bounce balls around a city builder” mini game) and a deep range of more difficult settings and enemies to slowly unlock, and you have a game whose addictive pull will last much longer than you might expect from the simple premise.</p>

      </a></figure>
<p>Usually, when formulating a list like this, you can compare a title to an existing game or genre as a shorthand to explain what’s going on to newcomers. That’s nearly impossible with <i>Blue Prince</i>, a game that combines a lot of concepts to defy easy comparison to games that have come before it.</p>
<p>At its core, <i>Blue Prince</i> is about solving the mysteries of a house that you build while exploring it, drafting the next room from a selection of three options every time you open a new door. Your initial goal, if you can call it that, is to discover and access the mysterious “Room 46” that apparently exists somewhere on the 45-room grid. And while the houseplan you’re building resets with every in-game day, the knowledge you gain from exploring those rooms stays with you, letting you make incremental progress on a wide variety of puzzles and mysteries as you rebuild the mansion from scratch again and again.</p>
<p>What starts as a few simple and relatively straightforward puzzles quickly unfolds fractally into a complex constellation of conundrums, revealed slowly through scraps of paper, in-game books, inventory items, interactive machinery, and incidental background elements. Figuring out the more intricate mysteries of the mansion requires careful observation and, often, filling a real-life mad scientist’s notepad with detailed notes that look incomprehensible to an outsider. All the while, you have to manage each day’s limited resources and luck-of-the-draw room drafting to simply find the right rooms to make the requisite progress.</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>Getting to that storied Room 46 is enough to roll the credits on <i>Blue Prince</i>, and it serves as an engaging enough puzzle adventure in its own right. But that whole process could be considered a mere tutorial for a simply massive endgame, which is full of riddles that will perplex even the most experienced puzzlers while slowly building a surprisingly deep story of political intrigue and spycraft through some masterful environmental storytelling.</p>
<p>Some of those extreme late-game puzzles might be too arcane for their own good, honestly, and will send many players scrambling for a convenient guide or wiki for some hints. But even after playing for over 100 hours over two playthroughs, I’m pretty sure I’m still not done exploring all that <i>Blue Prince</i> has to offer.</p>

<h2><em>Civilization VII</em></h2>

      </a></figure>
<p>This one will be controversial: I love <i>Civilization VII</i>.</p>
<p><i>Civilization VII</i> launched as a bit of a mess. There were bugs and UI shortcomings aplenty. Most (but not all) of those have been addressed in the months since, but they’re not the main reason this is a tricky pick.</p>
<p>The studio behind the Civilization franchise, Firaxis, has long said it has a “33/33/33″ approach to sequels in the series, wherein 33 percent of the game should be familiar systems, 33 percent should be remixes or improvements of familiar systems, and 33 percent should be entirely new systems.</p>
<p>Critics of <i>Civilization VII</i> say Firaxis broke that 33/33/33 rule by overweighting the last 33 percent, mainly to chase innovations in the 4X genre by other games (like <i>Humankind</i>). I don’t disagree, but I also welcome it.</p>
<p>Credit is due to the team at Firaxis for ingeniously solving some longstanding design problems in the franchise, like using the new age transitions to curb snowballing and to expunge systems that become a lot less fun in the late game than they are in the beginning. Judged on its own terms, <i>Civilization VII</i> is a deep, addictive, and fun strategy game that I’ve spent more than 100 hours playing this year.</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>My favorite Civ game remains <i>Civilization IV</i>, but that game still runs fine on modern systems, is infinitely replayable out of the box, and enjoys robust modding support. I simply didn’t need more of the same from this particular franchise; to me, <i>VII</i> coexists with <i>IV</i> and others on my hard drive—very different flavors of the same idea.</p>

      </a></figure>
<p>I’m not sure I like what my minor <i>CloverPit</i> obsession says about me. When I <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/12/ars-technicas-top-20-video-games-of-2024/">fell into a deep <i>Balatro</i> hole last year</a>, I could at least delude myself into thinking there was some level of skill in deciding which jokers to buy and sell, which cards to add or prune from my deck, and which cards to hold and discard. In the end, though, I was as beholden to the gods of random number generation as any other <i>Balatro</i> player.</p>
<p><i>Cloverpit</i> makes the surrender to the vagaries of luck all the more apparent, replacing the video-poker-like systems of Balatro with a “dumb” slot machine whose handle you’re forced to pull over and over again. Sure, there are still decisions to make, mostly regarding which lucky charms you purchase from a vending machine on the other side of the room. And there is some skill involved in learning and exploiting lucky charm synergies to extract the highest expected value from those slot machine pulls.</p>
<p>Once you’ve figured out those basic strategies, though, <i>CloverPit</i> mostly devolves into a series of rerolls waiting for the right items to show up in the shop in the right order. Thankfully, the game hides plenty of arcane secrets beneath its charming PS1-style spooky-horror presentation, slowly revealing new items and abilities that hint that something deeper than just accumulating money might be the game’s true end goal.</p>
<p>It’s this creepy vibe and these slowly unfolding secrets that have compelled me to pour dozens of hours into what is, in the end, just a fancy slot machine simulator. God help me.</p>

<h2><em>Consume Me</em></h2>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/consumeme.jpg">
    
      </a></figure>
<p>Jenny is your average suburban Asian-American teenager, struggling to balance academic achievement, chores, an overbearing mother, romantic entanglements, and a healthy body image. What sounds like the premise for a cliché young adult novel actually serves to set up a compelling interactive narrative disguised as a mere mini-game collection.</p>
<p><i>Consume Me</i> brilliantly integrates the conflicting demands placed on Jenny’s time and attention into the gameplay itself. Creating a balanced meal, for instance, becomes a literal test of balancing vaguely <em>Tetris</em>-shaped pieces of food on a tray, satisfying your hunger and caloric limits at the same time. Chores take up time but give you money you can spend on energy drinks that let you squeeze in more activities by staying up late (but can lead to debilitating headaches). A closet full of outfits becomes an array of power-ups to your time, energy, or focus.</p>
<p>It takes almost preternatural resource management skills and mini-game execution to satisfy all the expectations being placed on you, which is kind of the meta-narrative point. No matter how well you do, Jenny’s story develops in a way that serves as a touching semi-autobiographical look at the life of co-creator Jenny Jiao Hsia. That biography is made all the more sympathetic here for an interactive presentation that’s more engaging than any young adult novel could be.</p>

      </a></figure>
<p><i>Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</i> should not be fun. Much like its predecessor, the latest release from famed game designer Hideo Kojima is about delivering packages—at least on the surface. Yet the process of planning your routes, managing inventory, and exploring an unfathomably strange post-apocalyptic world remains a winning formula.</p>
<p>The game again follows Sam Porter Bridges (played by Norman Reedus) on his quest to reconnect the world as humanity faces possible extinction. And yes, that means acting like a post-apocalyptic Amazon Prime. Standing in the way of an on-time delivery are violent raiders, dangerous terrain, and angry, disembodied spirits known as Beached Things.</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>It’s common to hear <i>Death Stranding</i> described as a walking simulator, and there is indeed a lot of walking, but the sequel introduces numerous quality-of-life improvements that make it more approachable. <i>Death Stranding 2</i> has a robust fast-travel mechanic and better vehicles to save you from unnecessary marches, and the inventory management system is less clunky. That’s important in a game that asks you to traverse an entire continent to deliver cargo.</p>
<p>Beyond the core gameplay loop of stacking heavy boxes on your back, <i>Death Stranding 2</i> has all the Kojima vibes you could want. There are plenty of quirky gameplay mechanics and long cutscenes that add depth to the characters and keep the story moving. The world of <i>Death Stranding</i> has been designed from the ground up around the designer’s flights of fancy, and it works—even the really weird stuff almost makes sense!</p>
<p>Along the way, <i>Death Stranding 2</i> has a lot to say about grief, healing, and the value of human connection. The game’s most poignant cutscenes are made all the more memorable by an incredible soundtrack, and we cannot oversell the strength of the mocap performances.</p>
<p>It may take 100 hours or more to experience everything the game has to offer, but it’s well worth your time.</p>

<p>Since the days of <i>Donkey Kong Country</i>, I’ve always felt that Mario’s original ape antagonist wasn’t really up for anchoring a Mario-level platform franchise. <i>Donkey Kong Bananza</i> is the first game to really make me doubt that take.</p>
<p><i>Bonanza </i>is a great showcase for the new, more powerful hardware on the Switch 2, with endlessly destructible environments that send some impressive-looking shiny shrapnel flying when they’re torn apart. It can’t be understated how cathartic it is to pound tunnels up, down, and through pretty much every floor, ceiling, and wall you see, mashing the world itself to suit your needs.</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p><i>Bonanza</i> also does a good job aping <i>Super Mario Odyssey</i>’s tendency to fill practically every square inch of space with collectible doodads and a wide variety of challenges. This is not a game where you need to&nbsp;spend a lot of time aimlessly wandering for the next thing to do—there’s pretty much always something interesting around the next corner until the extreme end game.</p>
<p>Sure, the camera angles and frame rate might suffer a bit during the more chaotic bits. But it’s hard to care when you’re having this much fun just punching your way through <i>Bananza</i>’s imaginative, colorful, and malleable world.</p>

<p>For a series that has always been about dodging, <i>Doom: The Dark Ages</i> is much more about standing your ground. The game’s key verbs involve raising your shield to block incoming attacks or, ideally, parrying them back in the direction they came.</p>
<p>It’s a real “zig instead of zag” moment for the storied <i>Doom</i> series, and it does take some getting used to. Overall, though, I had a great time mixing in turtle-style blocking with the habitual pattern of circling-strafing around huge groups of enemies in massive arenas and quickly switching between multiple weapons to deal with them as efficiently as possible. While I missed the focus on extreme verticality of the last two <i>Doom</i> games, I appreciate the new game’s more open-world design, which gives completionist players a good excuse to explore every square inch of these massive environments for extra challenges and hidden collectibles.</p>
<p>The only real problem with <i>Doom: The Dark Ages</i> comes when the game occasionally transitions to a slow-paced mech-style demon battle or awkward flying dragon section, sometimes for entire levels at a time. Those variations aside, I came away very satisfied with the minor change in focus for a storied shooter series.</p>

But not all variations on this theme are created equal. <a href="https://danielben.itch.io/dragonsweeper"><i>Dragonsweeper</i></a> stands out from the crowd by incorporating a simple but arcane world of RPG-style enemies and items into its logical puzzles.</p>
<p>Instead of simply counting the number of nearby mines, each number revealed on the Dragonsweeper grid reflects the total health of the surrounding enemies, both seen and unseen. Attacking those enemies means enduring predictable counterattacks that deplete your limited health bar, which you can grow through gradual leveling until you’re strong enough to kill the game’s titular dragon, taunting you from the center of the field.</p>
<p>Altogether, it adds an intriguing new layer to the logical deduction, forcing you to carefully manage your moves to maximize the impact of your attacks and the limited health-restoring items scattered throughout the field. And while finishing one run isn’t too much of a challenge, completing the game’s optional achievements and putting together a “perfect” game score is enough to keep puzzle lovers coming back for hours and hours of compelling logical deduction.</p>

<p>At first blush, <em>Nightreign</em> feels like a twisted perversion of everything that has made FromSoft’s Souls series so compelling for so many years. What was a slow-paced, deliberate open-world RPG has become a game about quickly sprinting across a quickly contracting map, leveling up as quickly as possible before taking on punishing bosses. A moody solitary experience has become one that practically requires a group of three players working together. It’s like an <em>Elden Ring</em>-themed amusement park that seems to miss the point of the original.</p>
<p>Whatever. It still works!</p>
<p>Let the purists belly ache about how it’s not really <i>Elden Ring.</i> They’re right, but they’re missing the point. <i>Nightreign</i> condenses the general vibe of the <em>Elden Ring</em> world into something very different but no less enjoyable. What’s more, it packs that vibe into a tight experience that can be easily squeezed into a 45-minute sprint rather than requiring dozens of hours of deep exploration.</p>

      </a></figure>
<p><i>Ghost of Yotei</i> from Sucker Punch Productions starts as a revenge tale, featuring hard-as-nails Atsu on the hunt for the outlaws who murdered her family. While there is plenty of revenge to be had in the lands surrounding Mount Yotei, the people Atsu meets and the stories they have to tell make this more than a two-dimensional quest for blood.</p>
<p>The game takes place on the northern Japanese island of Ezo (modern-day Hokkaido) several centuries after the developer’s last samurai game, <i>Ghost of Tsushima</i>. It has a lot in common with that title, but <i>Ghost of Yotei</i> was built for the PS5 and features a massive explorable world and stunning visuals. It’s easy to get sidetracked from your quest just exploring Ezo and tinkering with the game’s photo mode.</p>
<p>The land of Ezo avoids some of the missteps seen in other open-world games. While it’s expansive and rich with points of interest, exploring it is not tedious. There are no vacuous fetch quests or mindless collecting (or loading screens, for that matter). Even when you think you know what you’re going to find at a location, you may be surprised. The interesting side quests and random encounters compel you to keep exploring Ezo.</p>
<p><i>Ghost of Yotei’s </i>combat is just as razor-sharp as its exploration. It features multiple weapon types, each with unlockable abilities and affinities that make them ideal for taking on certain foes. Brute force will only get you so far, though. You need quick reactions to parry enemy attacks and strike back—it’s challenging and rewarding but not frustrating.</p>

<p>It’s impossible to play <i>Ghost of Yotei</i> without becoming invested in the journey, and a big part of that is thanks to the phenomenal voice work of Erika Ishii as Atsu. Some of the game’s pivotal moments will haunt you, but luckily, the developer has just added a New Game+ mode so you can relive them all again.</p>

<p>There’s a moment in the second section of <i>Hades 2</i> where you start to hear a haunting melody floating through the background. That music gets louder and louder until you reach the game’s second major boss, a trio of sirens that go through a full rock-opera showtune number as you dodge their bullet-hell attacks and look for openings to go in for the kill. That three-part musical presentation slowly dwindles to a solo as you finally dispatch the sirens one by one, restoring a surprisingly melancholy silence once more.</p>
<p>It’s this and other musical moments casually and effortlessly woven through <i>Hades 2</i> that will stick with me the most. But the game stands on its own beyond the musicality, expanding the original game’s roguelike action with a compelling new spell system that lets you briefly capture or slow enemies in a binding circle. This small addition adds a new sense of depth to the moment-to-moment positional dance that was already so compelling in the original <i>Hades</i>.</p>
<p><i>Hades 2</i> also benefits greatly from the introduction of Melinoe, a compelling new protagonist who gets fleshed out through her relationship with the usual rogue’s gallery of gods and demigods. Come for her quest of self-discovery, stay for the moments of musical surprise.</p>

<p>A quickie sequel in the year or two after <i>Hollow Knight’s </i>out-of-nowhere success in 2017 might have been able to get away with just being a more-of-the-same glorified expansion pack. But after <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/08/explaining-the-internets-obsession-with-silksong-which-finally-comes-out-sept-4/">over eight years of overwhelming anticipation</a> from fans, <i>Silksong</i> had to really be something special to live up to its promise.</p>

    <div>
          
          
<p>Luckily, it is. <i>Silksong </i>is a beautiful expansion of the bug-scale underground universe created in the first game. Every new room is a work of painterly beauty, with multiple layers of detailed 2D art drawing you further into its intricate and convincing fallen world.</p>
<p>The sprawling map seems to extend forever in every direction, circling back around and in on itself with plenty of optional alleyways in which to get lost searching for rare power-ups. And while the game is a <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/09/is-hollow-knight-silksong-too-hard-well-it-depends-on-what-you-mean-by-hard/">punishingly hard</a> take on action platforming, there’s usually a way around the most difficult reflex tests for players willing to explore and think a bit outside the box.</p>
<p>Even players who hit a wall and never make it through the sprawling tunnels of <i>Silksong</i>’s labyrinthine underground will still find plenty of memorable moments in whatever portion of the game they do experience.</p>

<p>In a real-time-strategy genre that can often feel too bloated and complex for its own good, <i>The King Is Watching</i> is a streamlined breath of fresh air. Since the entire game takes place on a single screen, there’s no need to constantly pan and zoom your camera around a sprawling map. Instead, you can stay laser-focused on your 5×5 grid of production space and on which portion of it is actively productive under the king’s limited gaze at any particular moment.</p>
<p>Arranging tiles to maximize that production of basic resources and military units quickly becomes an all-consuming juggling act, requiring constant moment-to-moment decisions that can quickly cascade through a run. I’m also a big fan of the game’s self-selecting difficulty system, which asks you to choose how many enemies you think you can take in coming waves, doling out better rewards for players who are willing to push themselves to the limit of their current capabilities.</p>

    <div>
          
          
<p>The bite-size serving of a single <i>King Is Watching </i>run ensures that even failure doesn’t feel too crushing. And success brings with it just enough in the way of semi-permanent ability expansions to encourage another run where you can reach even greater heights of production and protection.</p>

<p><i>Kingdom Come: Deliverance</i> was a slog that I had to will myself to complete. It was sometimes a broken and janky game, but despite its warts, I saw the potential for something special. And that’s what its sequel, <i>Kingdom Come: Deliverance II,</i> has delivered.</p>
<p>While it’s still a slow burn, the overall experience has been greatly refined, the initial challenge has been smoothed out, and I’ve rarely been more immersed in an RPG’s storytelling. There’s no filler, as every story beat and side quest offers a memorable tale that further paints the setting and characters of medieval Bohemia.</p>
<p>Unlike most RPGs, there’s no magic to be had, which is a big part of the game’s charm. As Henry of Skalitz, you are of meager social standing, and many characters you speak to will be quick to remind you of it. While Henry is a bit better off than his humble beginnings in the first game, you’re no demigod that can win a large battle single-handedly. In fact, you’ll probably lose fairly often in the early goings if more than one person is attacking you.</p>
<p>Almost every fight is a slow dance once you’re in a full suit of armor, and your patience and timing will be the key to winning over the stats of your equipment. But therein lies the beauty of <i>KC:D II:</i> Every battle you pick, whether physical or verbal, carries some weight to your experience and shapes Bohemia for better or worse.</p>

</a>After the incredible success of <em>Mario Kart 8 </em>and its various downloadable content packs on the Switch, Nintendo could have easily done a prettier “more of the same” sequel as the launch-window showcase for the Switch 2. Instead, the company took a huge gamble in trying to transform Mario Kart’s usual distinct tracks into a vast, interconnected open world.</p>
<p>This conceit works best in “Free Roam” mode, where you can explore the outskirts of the standard tracks and the wide open spaces in between for hundreds of mini-challenges that test your driving speed and precision. Add in dozens of collectible medallions and outfits hidden in hard-to-reach corners, and the mode serves as a great excuse to explore every nook and cranny of a surprisingly detailed and fleshed-out world map.</p>
<p>I was also a big fan of Knockout Mode, which slowly whittles a frankly overwhelming field of 24 initial racers to a single winner through a series of endurance rally race checkpoints. These help make up for a series of perplexing changes that hamper the tried-and-true Battle Mode formula and long straightaway sections that feel more than a little bit stifling in the standard Grand Prix mode. Still, Free Roam mode had me happily whiling away dozens of hours with my new Switch 2 this year.</p>

<p>For decades now, I’ve been looking for a twin-stick shooter that fully captures the compulsive thrill of the <i>Geometry Wars</i> franchise. <i>Sektori</i>, a late-breaking addition to this year’s top games list, is the first game I can say does so without qualification.</p>
<p>Like <i>Geometry Wars</i>, <i>Sektori</i> has you weaving through a field filled with simple shapes that quickly fill your personal space with ruthless efficiency. But <i>Sektori</i> advances that basic premise with an elegant “strike” system that lets you dash through encroaching enemies and away from danger with the tap of a shoulder button. Advanced players can get a free, instant strike refill by dashing into an upgrade token, and stringing those strikes together creates an excellent risk-vs-reward system of survival versus scoring.</p>
<p><i>Sektori </i>also features an excellent <i>Gradius</i>-style upgrade system that forces you to decide on the fly whether to take basic power-ups or save up tokens for more powerful weaponry and/or protection further down the line. And just when the basic gameplay threatens to start feeling stale, the game throws in a wide variety of bosses and new modes that mix things up just enough to keep you twitching away.</p>
<p>Throw in an amazing soundtrack and polished presentation that makes even the most crowded screens instantly comprehensible, and you have a game I can see myself coming back to for years—until my reflexes are just too shot to keep up with the frenetic pace anymore.</p>

          <p>Vince Zampella, a video game developer who has co-created or helmed some of the most popular franchises in the world, died in a car crash on a Los Angeles highway at 12:45 pm Pacific time on Sunday, December 21. He was 55 years old.</p>
<p>According to the California Highway Patrol, Zampella was in a car on Angeles Crest Highway when the vehicle veered off the road and crashed into a concrete barrier. No other vehicles were reported to be part of the crash.</p>
<p>A passenger was ejected from the vehicle, while the driver was trapped inside after the vehicle caught fire. The driver died at the scene, and the passenger died after being taken to the hospital. The report did not indicate whether Zampella was the passenger or the driver.</p>
<p>Angeles Crest Highway is a scenic road under the San Gabriel Mountains on the eastern end of LA and is commonly used for Sunday leisure drives. The vehicle involved in the crash was a 2026 Ferrari 296 GTS.</p>
<h2>A storied career in game development</h2>
<p>Early in his career, Zampella worked at SegaSoft and Panasonic, and he was the lead designer for the influential World War II shooter <em>Medal of Honor: Allied Assault</em>, which was released in 2002. But it was the famed studio Infinity Ward that turned him into a household name for gamers. He co-founded Infinity Ward with Jason West and Grant Collier in 2002.</p>

<p>The new year is here, so let's see what Team NL and co. (or at least the ones we could get hold of who aren't still off enjoying their hols) have lined up for the weekend...</p>
<h2>Jim Norman, Staff Writer</h2>
<p>What day is this? Christmas? New Year? All concept of time has left me. All I have left is <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment">Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment</a> and enough cold ‘This Is Not’ Turkey Roast to feed a small army.</p>
<p>I'll be putting at least one of those to use this weekend (spoiler: it's not the turkey), and then maybe finally get around to checking out <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/yakuza-0-directors-cut">Yakuza 0</a> if I manage to polish things off.</p>

<h2>Gonçalo Lopes, Contributor</h2>
<p>Started the year taking care of something that has been nagging me for years.</p>
<p><strong>Ace Combat 6: Fires of Liberation</strong> was the one single entry in the whole franchise that I never owned because it remains an Xbox 360 exclusive. In those days I was a happy Wii owner and had no way to afford a RRoD incubator, but by the end of this weekend Gracemeria will be free again. I now understand why this entry is so revered within the Ace Combat community; no way a game could look and play this good in back in 2007.</p>
<p>On Switch 2 I am back to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/assassins-creed-shadows">Assassin’s Creed Shadows</a> since I managed to clear (almost) all my backlog on the system during the holidays.</p>
<p>First game of the year goes to <strong>Tape to Tape</strong>. This is the Steam-only, early access spiritual sequel to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/nhl_hitz_pro">NHL Hitz</a> with more than a hint of <strong>Shoresy</strong> for good measure. Winter is the perfect time for some action on the ice and that is exactly what I’m getting. Onwards to 2026!</p>
<h2>Gavin Lane, Editor</h2>
<p>Having worked most days beyond the 'big ones' this year — and with large amounts of Lego and food prep taking up my off days — I've barely managed to touch my Switch over Christmas. So, I've still got <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/skate-story">Skate Story</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/cast-n-chill-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Cast n Chill</a>, and I still need to get on the eShop and get <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/terminator_2d_no_fate">T2D</a> downloaded. Listening to the <a href="https://www.myperfectconsole.com/">My Perfect Console</a> GOTY podcast reminded me of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/expelled">Expelled</a>, too. Gotta make use of this brief January lull!</p>
<p>Speaking of the eShop, the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/batman_arkham_trilogy">Batman Arkham Trilogy</a> for 20€ is tempting me. By all accounts, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/batman_arkham_knight">Arkham Knight</a> is now in a playable state on Switch 2, it's the only one of the three I never got to, and owning <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/batman_arkham_asylum">Asylum</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/batman_arkham_city">City</a> on Switch would be nice, wouldn't it?</p>
<p>And the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/no-mans-sky-nintendo-switch-2-edition">No Man's Sky</a> icon is still sitting there on my Home screen, poking and prodding me. <em>C´mon, now's the time.</em></p>

<h2>Ollie Reynolds, Staff Writer</h2>
<p>I actually haven’t been spending much time on the Switch over Christmas and New Year; not as much as I’d like, at least. I’ve been glued to the PS5 playing <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/silent_hill_f">Silent Hill F</a>, and my goodness, it’s incredible! The environmental design, the atmosphere, the monsters… It’s peak Silent Hill, and I’m keen to really take my time with it and soak it all in.</p>
<p>I also bought <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/grand_theft_auto_the_trilogy_-_the_definitive_edition">Grand Theft Auto: The Trilogy - The Definitive Edition</a> while it’s on sale, and it’s proving to be a delightful little blast from the past so far. It’s clearly been improved drastically since its initial release, with some lovely classic lighting and ray-tracing, and the combat controls are generally much more approachable than they used to be.</p>

This decay and rebirth, as part of the circle of life, make the Maggotkin extremely durable with high health and extra saves, but at the cost of mobility, as they plod slowly forward, relying on their resilience to get them into the fight, rather than speed.</p><p>The Maggotkin's new Battletome includes background for the Plaguefather's forces, warscrolls for returning and new units, a brand new Spearhead force, Path to Glory rules for creating your own hero, 2 armies of renown, and 2 regiments of renown (and we discuss one of them, The Pustules below).</p><picture>

  </picture><h2>Festus The Leechlord</h2><p>Festus the Leechlord is a new daemon prince for the Maggotkin. This former healer fell into Nurlge's clutches because he was obsessed with research, which led the Chaos god himself to train Festus. He rides a massive slug, Gathoblyt, into battle, which also keeps his workshop within reach so that he can create new poisons to use against his foes.</p><p>Festus can cast The Leechlord's Curse on an enemy, which has a chance to deal mortal wounds and heal Festus for each wound dealt, every time that unit uses a core ability or command. He can also poison units he is in combat with, dealing wounds to heroes and monsters, or simply slaying a model in a unit outright on a command roll off, and if any units in combat with Festus are slain, he gains D3 Leech points, which boost his command stat by the number he has.</p><p>Festus' model isn't particularly imposing, not when compared to the likes of <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/helsmiths-of-hashut-army-units-review-infernal-reinforcements" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">Urak Taar</a>, but it is a solid miniature, full of thematic detail that captures the mobile tainted apothecary.</p><picture>

This gives them a sweat-soaked and reeking ability, which stops units that have charged and are in combat with them from using commands on a 3+. The Rotswords come armed with Ruined Master Crafted weapons that have 2 attacks and deal 2 hits on a crit.</p><figure role="group">

Still mounted on their now corrupted steeds, they have 2 attacks dealing 3 damage on the charge, and their Pall of Exhaustion ability can give a unit they're in combat with Strike Last on a 3+.</p><p>The Sloven Knights come in a box of 3 fixed builds with different head options.

  </picture><h2>Putrid Blightkings</h2><p>The bloated Putrid Blightkings are some of the most devoted of Nurgle. They're extremely effective against wizards and priests, with their Discomforting Stench ability, which can make it more difficult for a targeting wizard or priest to use their spells and blessings by rolling over their power level. They're also armed with Pox-blighed weapons with 4 attacks, and rend 2 against priests and wizards.</p><p>The Putrid Blightkings come in a box of 5, with mainly fixed builds except for the 2 head options for the Champion, and the option to build a Standard Bearer, or normal Blightking.</p><picture>

  </picture><h2>The Pustules</h2><p>The Pustules are a Maggotkin Regiment of Renown, and the box comes with 10 Plaguebearers, a Spoilpox Scrivener, and a Feculent Gnarlmaw. The Spoilpox Scrivener is also available separately in this wave of releases, having only been available in the Spearhead box before. This Regiment of Renown can be included in forces from the other 3 Chaos gods (Blades of Khorne, Disciples of Tzeentch, Headonites of Slaneesh), or in Slaves to Darkness, Skaven, or <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/age-of-sigmar-helsmiths-of-hashut-army-set-review-let-fire-duardin-of-war" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">Helsmiths of Hashut</a> armies.</p><p>Normally, Nurgle's Plaguebearers are more difficult for enemies to hit while they're contesting an objective, and the Spoilpox Scrivener can boost their Control Score to help win that objective. The Gnarlmaw is a terrain feature that deploys at the start of the battle, and can heal the Plaguebearers if they are within 12 inches of it, and can return slain models if they are contesting an objective for some overlapping synergies to make sure your Plaguebearers dominate the objective their sitting on.</p><picture>

  </picture><h2>From The Depths Of Darkwater</h2><p>Several units from the recent <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/warhammer-quest-darkwater-review-cant-stop-rot" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">Warhammer Quest Darkwater</a> are getting separate releases and appear in the new Maggotkin of Nurgle Battletome. The only ones that don't make an appearance are Mulgoth the Cleaver and the Blight Templars, with the following releases in boxes we detail below.</p><ul><li>Court of Gelgus Pust - Gelgus comes in a box along with Belga the Cystwitch and Shaman Foulhoof. Gelgus comes armed with Malady and Contagion, which have 7 attacks with 3 damage each, and once per game, he can pollute a terrain feature that boosts the healing of nearby friendly units and reduces the healing of nearby enemy units. Belga can deal mortal wounds to diseased enemy units within 18 inches, and enemies removed by that ability can return slain Plaguebearers to the battlefield. Foulhoof can boost the attacks of nearby Pestigor units, which also get a release in this wave.</li><li>Pestigors - Pestigors are the beastmen of Nurgle, and come in boxes of 10. They are just as durable as their Nurgle brethren, with an additional save. They each have 2 attacks and gain Rend 1 within their own territory. Foulhood can boost those attacks to 3 to make them very capable.</li><li>Cankerborn - The Cankerborn come in a box of 2, and you get 2 objective miniatures, which are used to mark objectives or terrain at the end of any turn with Pesilent Pollutants. The Cankerborn can use the Pollutants to teleport around the battlefield in their movement phase. They each have 4 attacks dealing 3 damage and dealing mortal wounds on crits.</li><li>Pox-Wretches - Pox-Wretches come in a box of 14, with 6 Mire Kelpie tokens, which the Pox-Wretches can remove to try and give a unit they're in combat with the Diseased keyword. The Diseased keyword plays into the Maggotkin of Nurgles' faction abilities, like the Blessed by the Plaguefather ability, which deals 1 mortal wound to all enemy units if all enemies have the Diseased keyword.</li></ul><h2>Age of Sigmar Maggotkin of Nurgle Units Final Thoughts?</h2><p>I've always been a fan of the Plaguefather's forces. I love the detail that the 2 ranges miniatures have (<em>AoS</em> and <em>40K</em>), and these new sculpts are no different. I've always been respectful of their resilience, having come across them many times playing <em>Warhammer 40,000</em>. It also pleases me that the releases come hot off the back of the release of <em>Warhammer Quest Darkwater</em> and that the units are available so soon after, rather than being locked behind a separate game.&nbsp;</p><p>The new Maggotkin of Nurgle units have a lot of synergies on the battlefield, through the common goal of spreading disease to empower other abilities, and through local abilities like Foulhoof boosting the Pestigors. The Pustules regiment of renown is a lot of fun, and making the Plaguebearers even more resilient than normal is very satisfying. The whole wave of new release miniatures is full of fantastic detail, but the Sloven Knights and the Rotswords musician are my favourites.</p><hr><p><em>The copies of</em> <strong>The Age of Sigmar Maggotkin of Nurgle releases&nbsp;</strong><em>used to produce this review were provided by Games Workshop.</em></p></div><div><p><span><div>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p><strong>FYQD</strong>, the one-man studio led by <strong>Zeng Xiancheng</strong> and known for <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/bright-memory-infinite-interview-zeng-on-raytracing-next-gen-and-december-target-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bright Memory Infinite</a></strong>, has announced a new game. In a tweet <a href="https://x.com/FYQD_Studio/status/2006553505306489063" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">posted on X</a>, he said the currently untitled project is a third-person action shooter game set during the historical period of the <strong>Republic of China</strong>, 'amidst a time of turmoil and collapsing order, rival gangs clash in the shadows, as violence and conspiracy quietly spread through the streets.'</p>



<p>The Republic of China was formally established at the beginning of <strong>1912</strong>, following the <strong>Xinhai Revolution</strong> that ended <strong>over two thousand years of imperial history</strong>. It lasted until <strong>1949</strong>, when the Kuomintang-led government was ultimately defeated in the <strong>Chinese Civil War</strong> and forced to retreat to <strong>Taiwan</strong>, while the <strong>Chinese Communist Party</strong> assumed control of the mainland and founded the <strong>People's Republic of China</strong>.</p>



<p>It is certainly a unique setting for a videogame. Most titles set in China are based on much earlier eras, such as the <strong>Three Kingdoms (AD 220–280)</strong> (by far <a href="https://wccftech.com/romance-of-the-three-kingdoms-8-remake-to-launch-on-october-24/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the most used setting in games</a>), the <strong>Tang Dynasty (618–907)</strong>, and the <strong>Ming Dynasty (1368–1644)</strong>. Indeed, when FYQD shared the news on the Chinese social network <strong>Bilibili</strong>, a user advised him 'not to touch' the subject matter, as 'getting involved with real history is never a good thing'. The Bright Memory Infinite developer replied:</p>



<p><em>The story and all aspects of this work are fictional and have no connection or association with actual historical events. It merely uses the Republican era as a background setting. The focus of the game is on third-person action shooting.</em></p>



<p>Depending on the story's depiction, it could indeed attract scrutiny from the Chinese government. However, FYQD is undoubtedly aware of that, and it does not sound like he's planning to make the game controversial.</p>

<p>The developer also posted a few gorgeous in-game screenshots of the game on social media. That's not much of a surprise, though, as his graphical skills were already shown in Bright Memory Infinite. Be prepared for a long wait, though: this seems to be a way more complex project.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, the studio's previous game is now <strong>50% off on Steam</strong> and <strong>30% off on the PlayStation, Xbox, and Nintendo stores</strong>. Over 90% of the global Steam user reviews are positive, and sales estimates based on SteamDB project a range between 1.18 million units and 2.32 million units sold on Valve's platform.</p>

<h2 id="h-faker-recognized-in-new-year-s-ceremony">Faker Recognized in New Year’s Ceremony</h2>



<p>Faker was invited to the State Guest House in Cheong Wa Dae to receive his Cheongnyong Medal, recognizing his dedication and evolution in the esports industry over the last ten years.</p>



<p>For just over a decade, Faker has been dominating the League of Legends space, and has secured more world titles than any ofther competitor in the business. He has secured records in the domestic space in South Korea and has become synonymous with the ongoing success of the esports industry.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It’s an enormous personal honor to receive a decoration that represents the Republic of Korea. But I could not be standing here without the teammates and colleagues who have run alongside me up to this point.</p>



<p>This would have been impossible without the support of the fans who are always there giving me strength. I will continue to devote myself with my best effort in every moment, both in and out of competition, so that I can share positive messages and help raise the stature of Korean esports.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In social circles, Faker is seen as an eternal ‘good guy’ who never fails to deliver. He’s a stalwart competitor but also a wholesome, charitable, and polite individual who takes his success in his stride.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Todd Howard Showed No Interest in Fallout 4’s Most Impressive Mod]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/todd-howard-no-interest-fallout-4-mod-london/</link>
            <guid>1396324</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>In July 2024, Fallout: London was released after years of development. The game-sized mod represented one of the most ambitious and long-awaited conversion projects in the history of the Fallout franchise, and it was very well received by fans worldwide. Owing to the size and stature of Fallout: London, it garnered quite a cult following over the years.</p>



<p>However, one of the people who perhaps <strong>should </strong>have been interested in it but <strong>wasn’t </strong>was Bethesda Game Studios’ Todd Howard. In a recent interview, Howard revealed that he hasn’t played and never really followed Fallout: London, arguably the biggest Fallout 4 mod ever created and a transformative, mighty project.</p>







<h2 id="h-todd-howard-plays-it-safe-with-fallout-london">Todd Howard Plays it Safe with Fallout: London</h2>



<p>The driving theory behind Todd Howard’s apparent disinterest in Fallout: London is that he was hampered from praising the project by legal conditions. It’s no big secret that mods walk a grey area when it comes to legitimacy and IP infringement, but they’re part and parcel of the Bethesda landscape regardless.</p>



<p>If Todd Howard started gushing over Fallout: London, he’d have netizens taking to social media the world over to declare the mod canon, or something.</p>



<p>In a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/fallout4london/comments/1q03rsp/todd_howard_on_fallout_london/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">recent interview</a> hosted to celebrate the launch of Fallout’s second season, Todd Howard was asked about his interest in the Fallout: London mod, but the recognizable developer played coy:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Only some videos that I’ve seen online; I have not played it.</p>



<p>Only a little bit. I would say we look at a lot of the modding that’s going on, and when you have those total conversions – I just want to say how <em>hard </em>that is.</p>



<p>And so, the fact that it came out, first of all, because most of those never come out, and the fact that it came out… It seems a lot of fans love it.</p>



<p>It’s just – I need to express to everybody out there how difficult and what a journey that is for some of these big mod teams to do stuff like that.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It also doesn’t help that he’s probably so busy he’s lucky ever to scrape a few hours playing <strong>any </strong>Fallout game, modded or otherwise.</p>



<p>Fallout: London represents what’s possible when a team of dozens pours resources, time, money, and effort into creating a passion project and turning it into something tangible and wholly accepted by a community. It’s one of the single-biggest mods in the gaming space, and it takes Fallout 4 and manipulates it into something otherworldly.</p>



<p>Team FOLON, the folks behind the mod, did such a good job that one or two of them were ultimately <strong>hired </strong>by Bethesda Game Studios.</p>



<p>When it launched, it was hosted on GOG and was downloaded a whopping 500,000 times in 24 hours, and in 2025, a <strong>VR version </strong>of the mod surfaced. If that wasn’t enough, more than a year after release, an expansion called Rabbit and Pork dropped, fuelling more interest in the mod.</p>

<p>During a New Year chat, he has now been asked once again about the possibility of this title coming to Switch systems and has reportedly told fans to "please look forward to it" (<a href="http://blog.livedoor.jp/umadori0726/archives/62900051.html">thanks, Livedoor</a>).</p>
<p>Yoshida has been talking about bringing Final Fantasy XIV Online to Nintendo platforms for a number of years now. In June 2024, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2024/06/final-fantasy-xiv-online-director-would-love-to-see-square-enixs-mmo-on-a-nintendo-platform">he noted at the time</a> how the game could potentially target Nintendo's Switch "successor".</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytC1rrCdi_XjA" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067vutnqw&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>841k</span></a></p>

<p>More recently, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/final-fantasy-14-director-has-had-positive-discussions-with-nintendo-on-switch-2-port">in August last year at Gamecom</a>, he mentioned how his team and Nintendo had "positive discussions" about the possibility of a port. Keep in mind, there has been no official announcement at this stage for Nintendo platforms.</p>
<p>In the immediate future, Square Enix is focused on bringing <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade">Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade</a> to the Switch 2 this month.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/elder-scrolls-online-project-blackbird-shooter-rpg-canceled-microsoft-2000656493</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Matt Firor founded Zenimax Online in 2007 and helped Bethesda shepherd<em> The Elder Scrolls Online</em> into one of the premier MMORPGs out there. He left abruptly last summer when Microsoft laid off dozens at the studio amid a wider bloodbath at the company and canceled the upcoming online multiplayer game he and others were working on, <a href="https://kotaku.com/blackbird-mmorpg-leaks-gta-dan-houser-eso-free-2000615981">Project Blackbird</a>. He recently broke his silence on the reason for his departure, confirming what fans had long suspected.</p> <p>“Project Blackbird was the game I had waited my entire career to create, and having it canceled led to my resignation,” Firor wrote in a January 1 post on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7412202293737046016/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-analytics-id="inline-link" data-url="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7412202293737046016/" data-hl-processed="none" data-mrf-recirculation="inline-link" data-hawk-tracked="hawklinks" data-mrf-link="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7412202293737046016/">LinkedIn</a>&nbsp;which he later <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:sdsbjnwwyzxwz3b4lqtbtwd5/post/3mbeicw5hgw2f?ref_src=embed&amp;ref_url=https%253A%252F%252Fwww.pcgamer.com%252Fgames%252Fmmo%252Fformer-elder-scrolls-online-chief-confirms-microsofts-2025-bloodbath-drove-his-departure-from-zenimax-project-blackbird-was-the-game-i-had-waited-my-entire-career-to-create%252F">shared on Bluesky</a>. “My heart and thoughts are always with the impacted team members, many of whom I had worked 20+ years with, and all of whom were the most dedicated, amazingly talented group of developers in the industry.”</p>   <p>The post never mentions Microsoft directly and doesn’t take aim at the decision makers at Xbox, which acquired Zenimax Online in 2021, but the move clearly left a very bad taste in many veteran developers’ mouths. Some of Firor’s former colleagues went on to form Sackbird Studios to work on their own multiplayer game. “With internal funding and full creative control, the studio is focused on crafting bold, character-driven experiences free from corporate compromises,” they <a href="https://kotaku.com/halo-studios-gta-6-price-fortnite-simpsons-2000633663">wrote last year</a>.</p>

 <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-layoffs-zenimax-online-blackbird-elder-scrolls-1851785629"><em>Bloomberg</em> reported</a> that Blackbird was an ambitious loot shooter that mixed elements of <em>Destiny</em> and <em>Blade Runner</em> with the structure and questlines of an MMORPG. Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer reportedly played a build of the game last March and loved what he saw, making its eventual cancelation even more perplexing. The layoffs and cuts came as Xbox game studios were <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-microsoft-price-hike-game-pass-layoffs-new-console-2000638546">reportedly tasked</a> with achieving a controversial 30-percent profit margin despite being forced to make all of their games playable for free on Game Pass.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/ps-plus-jan-2026-free-monthly-games-core-keeper-2000656495</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The first free monthly <a href="https://kotaku.com/ps-plus-december-2025-extra-assassins-creed-jrpg-2000652236">PlayStation Plus games</a> for paying subscribers in 2026 have been revealed and it’s a sleepy month for PS5 and PS4 players. There are also only three additions for this month, compared to last month’s five.</p> <p>On December 31, Sony revealed the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/12/31/playstation-plus-monthly-games-for-january-need-for-speed-unbound-disney-epic-mickey-rebrushed-core-keeper/">first batch of PS Plus Essential games</a> coming this year and while they’re decent games, none of the picks make a big splash. These games will be available to add to your PlayStation library permanently beginning on January 6. Once added, you can install them and play them whenever you want as long as you are an active PS Plus Essential, Extra, or Premium subscriber. Here’s the list of games and what platforms they are available on:</p> <ul> <li> <p><em>Need For Speed Unbound</em> | PS5</p> </li> <li> <p><em>Disney Epic Mickey: Rebrushed</em> | PS4, PS5</p> </li> <li> <p><em>Core Keeper</em> | PS4, PS5</p> </li> </ul> <p><em>Rebrushed</em> is the 2024 remaster of the 2010 platformer from <em>Deus Ex</em> director Warren Spector. Nice for anyone who didn’t play the original or wants an important lesson in game development history. <em>Unbound</em>, meanwhile, is the 25th installment in the&nbsp;<em>Need for Speed</em> series and features a neat cel-shaded art style. The 2022 release is a fun racer but far from the most memorable in the franchise.</p>

 <p><em>Core Keeper</em> is arguably the best pick-up this month. It’s a top-down pixel art crafting sim that marries <em>Minecraft</em> and <em>Stardew Valley</em>. Like those games it continues to receive meaty free updates, with one coming later this month called Void &amp; Voltage. Not the worst month overall, though not as generous as last month’s <a href="http://PlayStation Plus games">pre-holiday haul</a>.</p>

              <p>2026 is shaping up to be another big year for video games. The next 12 months are set to bring massive sequels like <em>Forza Horizon 6, Resident Evil Requiem,</em> and <em>Gears of War: E-Day.</em> There are also some smaller games we’re excited to get our hands on, like <em>Bubsy 4D, Mouse: P.I. for Hire,</em> and <em>Slay The Spire 2.</em> And of course, there’s<em> Grand Theft Auto 6,</em> which, assuming it doesn’t get delayed again, will close out 2026 with a big, industry-shaking bang.</p> <p>There are so many games to be excited about in 2026 that you might have forgotten about some of them. So we here at <em>Kotaku</em> have created this handy list of 31 games we’re excited to play in the new year. Now, place your bets for how many will actually launch in 2026 and how many will instead be delayed to 2027 or beyond.</p>

 <h2><b><i>Resident Evil Requiem</i></b><b> – Feb. 27</b></h2>  <p><span>I was already excited for a new mainline </span><i><span>Resident Evil</span></i><span> game arriving in early 2026; you didn’t need to add Leon Kennedy. But I’m very grateful. -Zack Zwiezen</span></p>

 <h2><b><i>Lego Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight </i></b><b>– 2026&nbsp;</b></h2>  <p><span>We ain’t getting a new </span><i><span>Arkham </span></i><span>game anytime soon, so this Lego spin on the formula will have to do. Luckily, it looks rad as heck. – Zack Zwiezen</span></p> <h2><b><i>Forza Horizon 6 </i></b><b>– 2026</b></h2>  <p><span>The follow-up to one of the best Xbox games ever made, and it’s set in a gorgeously dense open-world recreation of Japan. Yup. That’s going to be goooood. – Zack Zwiezen</span></p>

 <h2><b><i>Control Resonant </i></b><b>– 2026</b></h2>  <p><span>Remedy’s 2019 </span><i><span>Control </span></i><span>was a wonderful and creepy paranormal shooter. I’ve desperately wanted a sequel, and that’s finally arriving next year. – Zack Zwiezen</span></p>

 <h2><b><i>Mouse: P.I. for Hire </i></b><b>– March 19</b></h2>  <p><span>Mixing a boomer shooter with classic black-and-white cartoons is an odd choice, but the final product seems awesome, and we don’t have to wait long to play. – Zack Zwiezen</span></p>

 <h2><b><i>007 First Light –</i></b><b> March 26</b></h2>  <p><span>IOI, the people behind </span><i><span>Hitman</span></i><span>, seem like the perfect studio to make a James Bond game. Hopefully, it all comes together in the spring. – Zack Zwiezen</span></p> <h2><b><i>Bubsy 4D</i></b><b> – 2026</b></h2>  <p><span>I didn’t have “Excited for a new <em>Bubsy</em> game” on my bingo card for 2026, but here we are. What can I say? <em>Bubsy 4D</em> looks good. – Zack Zwiezen</span></p>

 <h2><b><i>The Duskbloods</i></b><b> – 2026</b></h2>  <p><span>FromSoftware’s upcoming eight-player online action RPG sounds like a great idea </span><i><span>now</span></i><span>, after </span><i><span>Nightreign </span></i><span>proved to be a huge hit and a great game. Hopefully, the Switch 2 is able to handle it. – Zack Zwiezen</span></p> <h2><b><i>Gears of War: E-Day </i></b><b>– 2026</b></h2>  <p><span>I’m sad that <em>Gears 5</em>’s story isn’t moving forward. Still, it should be fun seeing Marcus and Dom back together in this upcoming prequel to the OG Xbox 360 trilogy. – Zack Zwiezen</span></p> <h2><b><i>Star Wars: Galactic Racer</i></b><b> – 2026</b></h2>  <p><span>So many <em>Star Wars</em> games are RPGs, shooters, or action-adventure experiences. That’s fine, but I’m happy to see someone making a racing game set in my favorite sci-fi universe. – Zack Zwiezen</span></p>

 <h2><strong><em>Marathon</em> – March 2026</strong></h2>  <p>The it’s over/we’re so back graph has been all over the place on this one, but with a series of post-alpha test tweaks, including the addition of proximity chat, I’m once again looking forward to seeing Bungie’s take on the extraction shooter, especially if they can weave as much of the background sci-fi lore into a <em>Destiny</em>-style aspirational end-game as I’m hoping they can. <span>– Ethan Gach</span></p> <h2><b><i>Grand Theft Auto 6</i></b><b> – November 19&nbsp;</b></h2>  <p><span>At this point, I feel like I’ve written so many words about the upcoming</span><i><span> GTA 6 </span></i><span>that I’m not sure what else to say. You know what this game is. You are probably excited for it. Let’s hope Rockstar lands this sucker. – Zack Zwiezen</span></p>

 <h2><b><i>Marvel’s Wolverine</i></b><span> –<strong> 2026</strong></span></h2>  <p><span>Insomniac’s </span><i><span>Spider-Man</span></i><span> games have been joyous open-world treats that feel great to play. So people are understandably excited for the studio’s upcoming </span><i><span>Wolverine </span></i><span>game that looks fun and very, very bloody. – Zack Zwiezen</span></p> <h2><strong><em>Saros</em> – April 30</strong></h2>  <p><em>Returnal</em> will always have a special place in my heart, but I’m looking forward to seeing Housemarque branch off into a more forgiving roguelike arcade shooter structure with a robust metagame progression that gives more players more footholds, which will hopefully see more of them hang on and stick it out for the whole ride. <span>– Ethan Gach</span></p> <h2><strong><em>Mina the Hollower</em> – 2026</strong></h2>  <p>Following a brief delay, I can’t wait to see the <em>Shovel Knight</em> team’s take on <em>Castlevania</em> meets <em>The Legend of Zelda: Link’s Awakening</em>. I’m looking forward to a retro homage that pushes the genres it’s playing with to new heights. <span>– Ethan Gach</span></p>

 <h2><strong><em>Replaced</em> – March 12</strong></h2>   <p>This game looks incredible. Looking at it will be enough. Playing it will hopefully feel extra special. <span>– Ethan Gach</span></p> <h2><em>Forbidden Solitaire&nbsp;</em>– Q1 2026</h2>  <p><i><span>Forbidden Solitaire </span></i><span>is ostensibly about you finding and playing a spooky ‘90s CD-ROM solitaire game—think </span><i><span>The 7th Guest </span></i><span>but, y’know, solitaire—and getting way more than you bargained for. I have no idea what that means in gameplay terms, but I can’t wait to find out. – Carolyn Petit</span></p> <h2><strong><em>The Blood of Dawnwalker</em>&nbsp; – 2026</strong></h2>  <p>Ex-<em>Witcher 3</em> devs make a vampire immersive-sim RPG. Enough said. <span>– Ethan Gach</span></p> <h2><strong><em>Danganronpa 2×2</em> – 2026</strong></h2>  <p><em>Danganronpa 2: Goodbye Despair</em> is getting a fancy remake, but it’s also getting a new “what if” scenario in which different victims and killers manifest in its murder mystery. So hey, even if the new storyline isn’t great, we’ll get to play <em>Danganronpa 2&nbsp;</em>again. – Kenneth Shepard</p>

 <h2><strong><em><i>Pokémon</i> Champions</em> – 2026</strong></h2>  <p><i data-stringify-type="italic">Pokémon Champions&nbsp;</i>is the new competitive platform for the series moving forward, and it’s going to integrate several mechanics, such as Mega Evolution and Z-Moves, into one place, meaning it has the potential to completely transform the competitive space, and free up the main games to no longer be beholden to a particular way of doing things. – Kenneth Shepard</p> <h2><b><i>Mario Tennis Fever</i></b><b> – February 12</b></h2>  <p><span>The world needs more fun tennis games. Thank you, Mario and company, for hearing these calls and showing up so early in 2026 to deliver a game that looks like it’ll be exactly what folks want. – Zack Zwiezen</span></p>

 <h2><b><i>Tomb Raider: Legacy of Atlantis</i></b><b> – 2026</b></h2>  <p><span>Sure, another remake of the first </span><i><span>Tomb Raider game </span></i><span>seems a bit silly. But, hey, it looks great and will hold fans over until 2027’s </span><i><span>Tomb Raider: Catalyst.</span></i><span> – Zack Zwiezen</span></p> <h2><strong><em><i>Pokémon</i> Pokopia</em> – March 5</strong></h2>  <p><em><i>Pokémon</i> Pokopia </em>appears to be Pikachu and friends’ take on an <em>Animal Crossing</em>-style life sim, but it also seems to have a dark, post-apocalyptic setting that might keep it from being as cozy as other games in the genre. Intriguing! – Kenneth Shepard</p>

 <h2><strong><em>Pragmata</em> – April 24</strong></h2>  <p>New AAA franchises are so few and far between, it’s a special treat whenever we get one, especially out of Japan. It’s not 3D <em>Mega Man</em> but it might be the next best thing. <span>– Ethan Gach</span></p> <h2><strong><em>Marvel Tokon Fighting Souls</em> – 2026</strong></h2>  <p>When it comes to anime fighters, you don’t bet against Arc System Works.&nbsp;<em>Marvel Tokon Fighting Souls&nbsp;</em>is a 4v4 fighting game with Earth’s Mightiest Heroes on the roster, and it looks pretty rad. – Kenneth Shepard</p> <h2><strong><em>Scott Pilgrim EX</em> – 2026</strong></h2>  <p>It’s about time we got a new&nbsp;<em>Scott Pilgrim&nbsp;</em>beat em up, and this time, it’s coming with a brand new story by series’ creator Bryan Lee O’Malley set after the events of the <em>Scott Pilgrim Takes Off&nbsp;</em>anime. – Kenneth Shepard</p> <h2><strong><em>Demon Tides</em> – February 19</strong></h2>  <p><em>Demon Tides&nbsp;</em>is a modern-day PS2-style mascot platformer that manages to nail the middle ground between pinpoint precision and free-flowing, fast-paced action that so many others in the genre can’t quite inhabit. – Kenneth Shepard</p>

 <h2><strong><em>Nocturne</em> – June 30</strong></h2>  <p>I had to get at least one rhythm game on this list, and <em>Nocturne</em>, a rhythm RPG inspired by science fantasy games of the ’90s, is basically&nbsp;<em>Guitar Hero</em> meets&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy</em>. – Kenneth Shepard</p> <h2><strong><em>Slay the Spire 2</em>– March 2026</strong></h2>  <p>I slept on the first <em>Slay the Spire</em> when it initially launched. I will not make that mistake again. With most sequels I want a little bit more than just “bigger and better,” but with <em>Slay the Spire 2</em> that will be more than enough. <span>– Ethan Gach</span></p> <h2><b><i>Halo: Campaign Evolved</i></b><b> –</b><strong> 2026</strong></h2>  <p><span>Like </span><i><span>Tomb Raider</span></i><span>, it’s a bit silly that we are getting yet another remake of the first </span><i><span>Halo</span></i><span>, but this one is coming to PlayStation 5, and I wish I could go back in time and tell 12-year-old Zack that fact. It would blow his dumb pre-teen mind. – Zack Zwiezen</span></p> <h2><b><i>Yoshi and the Mysterious Book –</i></b><strong> 2026</strong></h2>  <p><span>This ain’t the Nintendo platformer I was hoping for in 2026, but it looks cute, and for folks who love the </span><i><span>Yoshi </span></i><span>games, well, here’s another one for you. – Zack Zwiezen</span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p><strong>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</strong> was undeniably the defining game of 2025. For all the industry discussion it drove, to its <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-game-awards-2025-winners-full-list/">dominating performance at <strong>The Game Awards 2025</strong></a>, it was the one game that came out of nowhere and took over for the year. Not only did it win Game of the Year at The Game Awards, but it was <a href="https://wccftech.com/golden-joysticks-awards-2025-winners-full-list/">the winner at the <strong>Golden Joysticks</strong></a>, and the choice of several media outlets across the globe as they all picked Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 as well. </p>



<p><a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/2025-video-game-awards-season-tracking-and-discussion-thread.1348411/">ResetEra user Angie keeps an amazingly long and detailed thread of games during each awards season</a>, with several stats for anyone interested to dig through. Now that we're into 2026, the numbers for 2025's awards season have mostly been tallied, with <strong>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 getting 291 Game of the Year wins in 2025</strong>.</p>



<p>That sets it just above Baldur's Gate 3, which was awarded 288 Game of the Year wins when it arrived in 2023. Ahead of it by a fairly large margin is The Last of Us Part II at 326, and ahead of everything by a country mile is Elden Ring with <strong>435 Game of the Year wins in 2022.</strong></p>



<p>Looking at the list, it'll be quite the event when/if something ever beats The Last of Us Part II and Elden Ring, since The Last of Us Part II is a solid 35 wins ahead of Clair Obscur, and Elden Ring is <strong>109 wins</strong> ahead of The Last of Us Part II. </p>



<p>Here's the full list of the 21 games with over 100 Game of the Year Wins:</p>



<ol>
<li>Elden Ring (FromSoftware) - 435</li>



<li>The Last of Us Part II (Naughty Dog) - 326</li>



<li><strong>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 (Sandfall Interactive) - 291</strong></li>



<li>Baldur's Gate III (Larian Studios) - 288</li>



<li>The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt (CD Projekt Red) - 281</li>



<li>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild (Nintendo EPD) - 264</li>



<li>God of War (2018) (Santa Monica Studio) - 263</li>



<li>The Last of Us (Naughty Dog) - 257</li>



<li>The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim (Bethesda) - 229</li>



<li>Astro Bot (Team Asobi) - 196</li>



<li>Uncharted 4: A Thief's End (Naughty Dog) - 190</li>



<li>Red Dead Redemption 2 (Rockstar Games) - 178</li>



<li>Grand Theft Auto V (Rockstar Games) - 163</li>



<li>Dragon Age: Inquisition (BioWare) - 139</li>



<li>Death Stranding (Kojima Productions) - 118</li>



<li>God of War Ragnarök (Santa Monica Studio) - 118</li>



<li>Uncharted 2: Among Thieves (Naughty Dog) - 115</li>



<li>The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom (Nintendo EPD) - 114</li>



<li>Overwatch (Blizzard Entertainment) - 114</li>



<li>Red Dead Redemption (Rockstar Games) - 111</li>



<li>Mass Effect 2 (BioWare) -102</li>
</ol>



<p>This may not be the most 'official' list in the view of some people, but it is an interesting one to look at as a way to 'take the temperature' of what games media and game critics value and look toward as their picks for what is the best of the best each year. The top five, for example, are all single-player, story-driven experiences, with four out of five being fantasy-based RPGs. The only game in the top ten that's not fantasy-based, isn't largely narrative-driven, doesn't have RPG mechanics, and isn't an open-world game is 2024's Astro Bot with 196 wins.</p>



<p>In the top 21 listed, the only multiplayer-focused game is Overwatch in 19th place. Rockstar, Naughty Dog, BioWare, Santa Monica Studios, and Nintendo all have multiple titles on the list, with Naughty Dog leading the pack at four.</p>



<p>Multiplayer games may be the games people are going to daily, and the ones that sell the most each year, but it's clear that they are not the ones critics are looking to as the best-of-the-best each year.</p>



<p>As for Wccftech's pick of 2025's best, Clair Obscur was indeed <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-games-of-2025-year-of-the-indie-ish/">one of our top ten Best Games for 2025</a>. It also made our list for <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-indie-games-of-2025-the-year-of-the-indie/">Best Indie games</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-role-playing-games-of-2025-another-incredible-year/">Best Role-Playing games</a>.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-port-asa-only-doable-ue-5-7-says-ark-dev-studio-trying-to-get-fg-running/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>I recently had the opportunity to speak for a solid hour with <strong>ARK: Survival Ascended Co-Creative Director and Lead Programmer Jeremy Stieglitz</strong>, and he had a lot to reveal, including the studio's ongoing attempts to bring the game to the <strong>Nintendo Switch 2</strong> platform.</p>



<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/ue-5-7-is-close-to-a-magic-bullet-for-performance-says-ark-developer-though-it-wont-fully-eliminate-stutters/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">In the previous slice of the gargantuan interview</a>, we focused on Stieglitz's confirmation that Unreal Engine 5.7 represents a massive performance boost in their testing. It is so massive, in fact, that the Nintendo Switch 2 port is only possible after the studio completes the engine upgrade to UE 5.7. The twist, however, is that even that alone won't be enough, which led Stieglitz to inform us that they are exploring ways to implement Frame Generation on the platform, utilizing either NVIDIA DLSS or AMD FSR 3.1. </p>



<p><em>Unreal Engine 5.7's performance boost is so extreme, in fact, that one of the reasons we had been working on it is that, on the side, we'd been exploring doing a Nintendo Switch 2 port of ARK: Survival Ascended. We actually have that running internally, and we found that <strong>the Nintendo Switch 2 port was only doable with Unreal Engine 5.7 with those performance upgrades</strong>. It wasn't possible otherwise. It was that significant a performance improvement. So, we're really excited to get that one out.</em></p>



<p><em>I should note that the good news is <strong>the 5.7 improvements, they're not PC specific</strong>. Most of them apply to both consoles as well. So, we're really looking forward to releasing this upgrade for the <strong>Xbox</strong> and <strong>PlayStation</strong> player base who, to this point, aren't still quite at the level of performance we would like them to be at. This is going to put those over the top in terms of getting them to the best possible performance state, which is, by our reckoning, <strong>a solid, unbreakable 60FPS is where we really want to be on those consoles</strong>. So, PlayStation and Xbox users have something to look forward to with that upgrade and not just PC users, but with Nintendo Switch 2 in particular... </em></p>



<p><em>We actually do have a working build of it and frankly, <strong>it was about half off where it needed to be performance-wise</strong>. Memory was actually very good, or I would say good enough. <strong>The Nintendo Switch 2 has, in effect, more addressable memory than the Xbox Series S</strong>, the so-called Lockhart platform, does. And so, since we already had basically scaled ARK: Survival Ascended for Series S, we found that we were in a better memory state than on that console and therefore weren't in a case of running out of memory on the Nintendo Switch 2, even with using more advanced graphics on the Switch 2 than we do on the Series S. But the issue was the GPU primarily being weaker. We were able to use all the primary rendering features. Working on it, we wanted to make sure that it looked essentially like the Xbox Series X version. </em></p>



<p><em><strong>We've downgraded the graphics quite significantly for Series S and we didn't want the Switch 2 experience to be like that</strong>. We needed the game to look approximately like the Series X version or the PlayStation 5 version, even if it would be at a lower resolution. So, the issue was not core rendering features. We would have to do <strong>Lumen</strong>, <strong>Nanite</strong>, and <strong>Virtual Shadow Maps</strong>. All three of those things are important to us on Switch 2. I think we may have dropped the shadows to Cascade Shadows rather than Virtual Shadow Maps, which is kind of a slightly older way of handling shadows, but in practice, most users wouldn't be able to tell the difference on a lower resolution device like the Nintendo Switch 2, which for us would be a 1080p handheld 1440p docked resolution as opposed to 4K in either case. So Cascade shadows are good enough, but Lumen and Nanite, Nanite in particular with the large open world foliage scenes, were just hammering it very badly, and we were basically about half off of where we needed to be on the Nintendo Switch 2. </em></p>



<p><em>What does the Switch 2 version need? I mean, let's be clear, <strong>it's not going to be a 60 FPS experience</strong>. It's just not in the cards for Switch 2 with ARK: Survival Ascended. But the bottom line is, <strong>it needs to be a solid 30 FPS experience</strong>, and we were about half off where we needed to be to get to that. That was prior to the Unreal Engine 5.7 test. We have found gains of about <strong>33 to 40% overall frame rate</strong>. It was completely GPU-bound, and it gains us about 33 to 40% off the GPU in those scenes. That was very, very good</em>, <em>but <strong>still not<br>where we need to be</strong> to get to a 30 FPS perceived frame rate solidly. </em></p>



<p><em>So, even the Unreal Engine 5.7 upgrade alone was not enough. There's one last thing we're exploring right now. It's still an open question, which is why I can't say precisely when the game would come out on the Nintendo Switch 2, because it really requires getting to that solid core 30 FPS frame rate. Right now, just to be quite frank, it's around 20 or so FPS on UE 5.7. So, how do we get to a 30-plus FPS frame rate? <strong>We're about to try experimenting with Frame Generation</strong>, but the truth is, I honestly don't know the results on that yet because it's not inherently something we can just turn on. It's not yet supported by either <strong>NVIDIA</strong>, who makes the Switch 2 GPU, or <strong>AMD</strong>. AMD has an open API for frame interpolation that theoretically can operate on the Switch 2, but they don't have a Switch 2-ready port of it. So, we would have to port it ourselves, or work with them to do so. We've been just starting the process of experimenting with whether NVIDIA DLSS Frame Generation is possible on the Switch 2, or if AMD's frame interpolation shader set is doable. We don't know the answer. One of those I have to presume will be doable, hopefully. I mean, it's technology that should in theory work, especially AMD's, which is not hardware specific. That should be doable, but we would have to explore more of the ports. Until we get more results on frame interpolation, we're still not quite where we need to be on the Nintendo Switch 2 version of ARK: Survival Ascended. </em></p>



<p><em>Let me be frank, <strong>I'd rather have a 30 FPS frame rate without frame interpolation</strong>. But if I can get to 20 to 25 without frame interpolation, then use frame interpolation to push it over 30 solidly, I think that'll feel good enough. I don't think it'll look too smeary or too laggy if we're close to 30 without it. The reality is we're getting there. It's looking good and it's progressing, so I hope it's going to happen and be released this year and is impressive. </em></p>



<p>I then asked if the game would utilize NVIDIA DLSS Super Resolution, which the Nintendo Switch 2 definitely supports (although not every game takes advantage of it). Stieglitz said yes, while also adding that <strong>NVIDIA has been 'vague' about whether the hybrid console can support DLSS Frame Generation</strong>.</p>



<p><em>Yeah, DLSS works fine and is quite impressive. It helps quite a bit with the up-resing and image sharpening and clarity, but they separate the DLSS upscaling algorithm from the Frame Generation algorithm. What we've heard from NVIDIA is that they don't currently support Frame Generation on the Switch 2, but they've been a little vague about whether it can be supported. So, <strong>we have to poke them a little harder and try and get an answer on that in the new year</strong>.</em></p>



<p>To our knowledge, the platform does not support it; however, it's interesting to hear that Studio Wildcard did not receive a conclusive 'no' from NVIDIA. Needless to say, it could be a big deal for future game releases if the Nintendo Switch 2 supported some form of Frame Generation. We'll remain vigilant on the subject.</p>



<p>Lastly for the Nintendo Switch 2 portion of our ARK: Survival Ascended interview, Stieglitz confirmed that if it does come out on the console, it will join the same community of PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X, unlike the <a href="https://wccftech.com/ark-survival-evolved-nintendo-switch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ill-fated Nintendo Switch port of ARK: Survival Evolved</a>.</p>



<p><em>If ARK: Survival Ascended does come out on the Nintendo Switch 2 (fingers crossed, and we are working on it), <strong>it would be a cross-platform, cross-multiplayer version of the game</strong>. It would not be a segmented, diluted, isolated version of the game. The original Switch 1 version of ARK: Survival Evolved was unfortunately a slightly watered-down and segmented version of the product, which made it difficult to maintain, and I also think led to it not being as successful as it otherwise would have been by not connecting with the wider player base and not getting all the same content. We wouldn't be making that mistake again for the new version if it comes to pass.</em></p>



<p>Stay tuned for the rest of our chat with Jeremy Stieglitz on ARK: Survival Ascended's recently launched premium DLC, <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/ark-survival-ascended-lost-colony-dlc-expansion-out-now-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Lost Colony</a></strong>, and what's next for the popular survival game.</p>

Bizarre as it is, that’s apparently the case, and PS5 jailbreakers are now trying to track down the limited number of physical copies of </span><i><span>Star Wars Racer Revenge </span></i><span>to crack the console open, with the price of the game going up significantly since the news broke.</span></p> <p><span>As </span><a href="https://resellcalendar.com/news/news/ps5-jailbreak-star-wars-racer-revenge-reseller/"><i><span>Resell Calendar</span></i></a> <span>outlines, PS5 hackers believe they’ve found a jailbreak for the system’s upcoming 12.00 system update, but the developers behind the jailbreak say you’ll need a physical copy of the 2019 </span><i><span>Racer Revenge</span></i><span> port to pull it off. This isn’t unheard of, as earlier jailbreak methods have required a Blu-ray disc to access the proper exploit, and the </span><i><span>Racer Revenge</span></i><span> port has an issue that allows users to “inject code into the system” and that has gone unpatched since the original 2002 release on PS2.</span></p>

            <title><![CDATA[Microsoft Tells Piggies To Stop Calling It AI Slop]]></title>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Gen AI isn’t going anywhere. In fact, it’s just getting started. That’s what Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella believes. He’d also like you to stop calling everything generated by LLM AI “slop.” People need to “get beyond” that in 2026, the executive who <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/satya-nadella-microsoft-xbox-pay">earned $79 million</a> in compensation recently announced.</p> <p>These and other musings were shared on his personal “sn scratchpad” blog in a December 29 post titled “<a href="https://snscratchpad.com/posts/looking-ahead-2026/?v=1">Looking ahead to 2026</a>.” It acknowledges the challenges of people figuring out how to actually use gen AI to do things that are useful, but remains bullish on the underlying technology itself to continue improving at a rate worth investing $100 billion in. Here’s the part that caught everyone’s’ attention, though:</p>

 <blockquote><p>We need to get beyond the arguments of slop vs sophistication and develop a new equilibrium in terms of our ‘theory of the mind’ that accounts for humans being equipped with these new cognitive amplifier tools as we relate to each other. This is the product design question we need to debate and answer.</p></blockquote> <p>I’m not sure what exactly Nadella means by “a new equilibrium in terms of our ‘theory of the mind,'” and perhaps he doesn’t either. Given the executive’s <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2025-05-15/microsoft-ceo-satya-nadella-on-his-ai-efforts-and-openai-partnership">penchant for folding AI use into every facet of his work life</a>, it’s not only possible but actually very likely that some version of Copilot, perhaps even a “rich” multi-agent “scaffold,” was the “bicycle for the mind” that helped him conjure this blog post in the first place. If true, that would be as good a reason as any not to move so quickly beyond the “slop vs. sophistication” distinction.</p>

 <p>But there’s no doubt a deeper philosophical schism that separates people who deploy the term “slop” against AI from those whose future is inextricably bound up in gen AI services becoming widely and eagerly adopted. For Nadella, the difference is one of apparent quality. Like the Turing test which ascribes human-like intelligence to anything that can convincingly manipulate language well enough to trick humans, some think it’s only slop if the slop can’t convince them otherwise. For others, it’s slop, no matter how sophisticated it may be, the second human creativity is interrupted, or even supplemented, by a plagiarism machine.</p>

 <p>In the world of cloud computing and stock prices, where everything is interchangeable and fungible, such distinctions are meaningless, or at the very least, don’t drive quarterly profit growth. But in the world of people, slop in is slop out. Being content to eat from the trough does not transform it into a Michelin Star meal.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[The Epic Games Store Saved You Over $550 With Its 2025 Holiday Daily Free Games]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/epic-games-store-free-game-saved-you-over-550/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>The Epic Game Store's annual holiday daily giveaways have come to an end, and if you redeemed each of the games that were made free for 24 hours between December 18 and January 1 (including <a href="https://wccftech.com/hogwarts-legacy-free-add-your-epic-games-store-library-through-december-18/">Hogwarts Legacy on December 11</a>), you just saved over $550 by not having to buy those games.</p>



<p>The giveaway ended with Epic giving away two games on January 1, 2026, instead of one: <a href="https://wccftech.com/wildgate-out-now-ps5-xbox-series-pc/"><strong>Wildgate</strong>, the PvP shooter from Dreamhaven that was released in 2025</a>, and <strong>Total War: Three Kingdoms</strong>. With those two games, and the fact that the Trine Collection was technically four games in one single day, the Epic Games Store gave away <strong>20 games this past holiday season.</strong></p>



<p>Totalling up the cost of the games at their non-discounted prices, you would have paid $567 USD to buy all of those games, including buying the four Trine games in a bundle as the Trine Collection. If you bought the Trine games individually, then the total goes up to $604.</p>



<p>That is not an insignificant amount of money saved if you're the kind of person who would have bought all of the games given away, which range in price and genre, from more narrative-driven and some smaller experiences that cost anywhere between $13-$30, to popular indies and even some triple-A titles costing between $40-$60. </p>



<p>Wildgate and Total War: Three Kingdoms will remain free for players to grab on the Epic Games Store until January 8, 2026, at which point the regular pace of one free game a week resumes, starting with Bloons TD 6.</p>



<p>Here's the full list of games that were given away by Epic, starting on December 11, and then starting daily from December 18 through to January 1:</p>



<ul>
<li>Hogwarts Legacy (Dec. 11-18)</li>



<li>Jotunnslayer: Hordes of Hel (Dec. 18)</li>



<li>Eternights (Dec. 19)</li>



<li>Blood West (Dec. 20)</li>



<li>Sorry We're Closed (Dec. 21)</li>



<li>Paradise Killer (Dec. 22)</li>



<li>Bloodstained: Ritual of the Night (Dec. 23)</li>



<li>The Callisto Protocol (Dec. 24)</li>



<li>Disco Elysium: The Final Cut (Dec. 25)</li>



<li>We Were Here Together (Dec. 26)</li>



<li>Cassette Beasts (Dec. 27)</li>



<li>SKALD Against the Black Priory (Dec. 28)</li>



<li>Viewfinder (Dec. 29)</li>



<li>Trine Collection (Dec. 30)</li>



<li>Chivalry 2 (Dec. 31)</li>



<li>Wildgate (Jan. 1)</li>



<li>Total War: Three Kingdoms (Jan. 1)</li>
</ul>



<p>It's all together, not a bad list of games. It's not the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1plsdrt/epic_games_christmas_free_game_giveaways_leaked/">fake list that appeared on Reddit</a> that seemed to gain traction based on how people would've genuinely loved it to be real. But it's not a terrible bunch of 20 games.</p>



<p>That said, what is unfortunate is that several of the titles, <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-callisto-protocol-free-on-epic-games-store/">including The Callisto Protocol</a> and Chivalry 2, were games that you might've already grabbed for free as a previous Epic Games Store giveaway. So you're not always getting something new to add to your library if you use the Epic Games Store.</p>
