			<p>F1 25 is just around the corner – OK, maybe it’s a chicane or chicken – with the latest entry in Codemasters’ long-running motorsport series set to arrive on the 30th of May for PS5, XSX|S and PC. While there are improvements over last year’s entry across the board, from extensive visual updates through to new systems and features that aim to bring the digital version of the sport closer than ever to the real thing, today’s focus is on the returning Braking Point, the F1 series’ central narrative mode, that drops you into the endless drama surrounding the fictional Konnersport team.</p>
<p><iframe title="F1 25 Braking Point 3 Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/D52QfcK9qJc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>A dramatic event sees the Konnersport team thrown into chaos this time around, and given the real-world drama that surrounds F1, they’ve got plenty to draw from, whether its the loss of sponsorship, drivers moving to another team, rookies nope-ing out of contracts on social media, or some wide-reaching breach of the extensive rules and regulations. Either way, things aren’t looking good at Konnersport, and you’re stepping in here to steady the ship.</p>


<p>New to this year’s entry is branching or alternative storylines, and you can decide which of the Konnersport drivers you’re going to take control of, leading to bespoke objectives for that driver, and a unique storyline conclusion. Whether that means there’s a minimum of two endings, or even more, we’re excited to find out, but it’s great to see Codemasters heaping new content into a mode that’s well-liked, but previously hasn’t had the same mileage as the others. It looks as though you’ll want to play through it multiple times to see all of the possibilities, and that’s a great option for those who tire of the long seasons or the high adrenaline and inevitable crashes of competitive online racing.</p>
<p>That’s not where the story ends though, as once you’ve finished with Braking Point you can take your driver into Driver Career or take the position as their Team Principal in My Team, making them the 11th team on the grid. I especially like this, giving the whole storyline some serious longevity and impact, and there’s also some mirroring of Brad Pitt’s forthcoming F1 movie or upcoming Cadillac team, where they will take this 11th spot.</p>


<p>While the on-screen action is at the heart of Braking Point, the team has made some welcome changes to various technical aspects of the mode, including the appearance of an all-new Hard mode to ramp up the challenge, and updating and revising the facial capture for the drivers using Nvidia’s Audio-to-Face technology through the returning interview sequences, making sure that the drama and high-tension moments look better than ever before. It’ll also benefit from all of the other improvements across the board, making it feel as though this is an essential part of the F1 25 experience.</p>
<p>2025 looks to be an amazing year for F1 storylines, and F1 25 hopes to put itself at the centre of that with Braking Point. We can’t wait to finally get our hands on it in the near future.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/oblivion-remastered-stability-performance-improvements-mods/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/oblivion-remastered-new-mods-introduce-stability-and-performance-improvements.1172415/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/oblivion-remastered-stability-performance-improvements-mods/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>A couple of Oblivion Remastered mods shared online a few hours ago introduce stability and performance improvements to the game, allowing those with more dated systems to run the game with fewer technical issues.</p>
<p>The No More VRAM Leaks Crashes mod, which was released today by SmokerNaruto on <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/399?tab=description" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nexus Mods</a>, is a modified Unreal Engine 5 configuration file that caps texture streaming to the user's GPU VRAM and disables ray tracing and Lumen to prevent crashes on GPUs with lower VRAM capacity, like 4 and 6 GB. However, improvements for 8 GB VRAM GPUs are also expected, so this mod is definitely worth a try for those who are having trouble running the game properly.</p>
<p>Much like stability, performance in Oblivion Remastered is not particularly solid on anything&nbsp;<span>other than a top-end machine. As such, the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/280?tab=description" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LEGEND FPS patch</a> by NBCoo is another mod that is more than worth a try. It</span> introduces some tweaks that can improve performance without significantly impacting the visuals, such as turning off motion blur, bloom, film grain, and even improving water. Some users, however, have experienced slightly worse performance with this mod, so the experience may vary depending on the system configuration.</p>
<p>After months of rumors and speculation, the Oblivion Remastered was finally confirmed to be real this week with a highly anticipated reveal, which came shortly before the game<a href="https://wccftech.com/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered-looks-gorgeous-and-its-out-now/"> launched</a> on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S. Developed by Virtuos, the game uses Unreal Engine 5's latest version to deliver improved visuals while keeping the Gamebryo engine for its underlying logic to offer gameplay mostly in line with the original, complete with some choice improvements such as revamped UI and more.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/frostpunk-1886-is-an-unreal-engine-5-reimagining-of-the-original-game/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Today, Polish developer 11 bit studios announced <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3645160/Frostpunk_1886/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Frostpunk 1886</a>, a reimagining of the original Frostpunk game powered by Unreal Engine 5 technology. The game is currently slated to launch at some point in 2027.</p>
<p>11 bit studios plan to provide a much improved visual experience, but they won't stop there. Fans can expect a lot of new content, mechanics, events, technologies, and buildings. There will even be an entirely new Purpose path in addition to the existing Faith and Order paths. Additionally, the switch from the original game's proprietary Liquid Engine to Epic's Unreal Engine 5 will also bring mod support, a feature that franchise fans have requested for years, to Frostpunk 1886.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the studio also expressed a desire to continue making content for both <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/frostpunk-2-day-after-tomorrow/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Frostpunk 2</a> and this reimagining of the original, keeping both updated for a long time.</p>
<p><iframe title="Frostpunk 1886 | New Game Announcement" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/q9fw6_MvSss?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The studio didn't share any further specifics, but there'll be time for that, given that we will have to wait for a couple of years. Meanwhile, you can refer to <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/frostpunk-chilling-good-stuff/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">our original Frostpunk review</a> (scored 8.5/10 back then):</p>
<p><em>Frostpunk is unforgiving and punishing but that’s why you’ll invest more and more time into it. It takes what you know about city builders and turns it on heads. It’s bleak, and the beautiful design brings life to an otherwise frozen hellscape. The race against the clock is stressful as you try to make sure everyone is alive while the weather gets colder and colder and materials become more and more scarce. Frostpunk is a pleasant surprise that is definitely worth your time if you’re looking for something different and brutally challenging.</em></p>
<p><em>Frostpunk is a challenging city builder where your decisions have dramatic repercussions on the citizens you’re tasked with looking after in a wintery apocalypse. It's a pleasant surprise that is definitely worth your time if you’re looking for something different and brutally challenging.</em></p>

            <p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/ea-sports-fc-25">EA Sports FC 25</a> is introducing its first paid battle pass, after previously experimenting with a free version of the feature.
</p>
<p>
Timed ahead of the game's Team of the Season (TOTS) event, EA will roll out a premium version of the Season 7 pass priced at 500k in-game UT Coins, or which you can buy for 1000 FC Points (around £9).
</p>
<p>
Access to this 40-tier pass begins today, 24th April, and will reward tradeable packs, Season Point boosters, TOTS items, evolution consumables and retro cosmetic evolutions. Its centrepiece is an exclusive 96-rated Immortal Icon Franck Ribery, the former French winger who spent most of his career at Bayern Munich. 
</p>
<p>
Announcing the Premium Pass, <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/ea-sports-fc/fc-25/news/pitch-notes-fc25-premium-pass">EA said</a> that while this iteration of the battle pass wouldn't change, it would be  "monitoring your feedback to make sure we deliver the best experience possible in whatever mode you play in FC moving forward".
</p>
<p>
Anyone with feedback is invited to provide it via the EA Sports Discord, or EA's own direct feedback portal. 
</p>
<p>
On social media, however, the opinions are somewhat mixed. While some players have pointed to the items within the pass making up for its costs - and Ribery alone being worth the coins - others have said that Ultimate Team is already a money-sucking experience, without another additional thing to buy.
</p>
<p>
"Having Players EXCLUSIVE to the Paid Season pass is extremely greedy and is not the path to go down," <a href="https://x.com/Wildcatz442/status/1915300812835737605">wrote social media user Wildcat</a>. "If its packs/cosmetics/SP/kits im sure 99 percent of the community won't mind. But locking a card like that ribery behind a paywall??? Even if its only 500k coins its just greedy as hell."
</p>
<p>
"Don't get the outrage," <a href="https://x.com/NCFC_CJW/status/1915325530091487610">wrote Norwich City supporter Callum</a>, however. "I ain't sticking up for EA but if that Ribery was an SBC everyone would be happy spending 500k on it 😂 Let alone the other rewards (you even get coins back from tradable packs)."
</p>
<p>
EA Sports recently said that its upcoming <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-sports-says-switch-2-versions-of-fc-and-madden-nfl-to-have-feature-parity-with-consoles-as-much-as-the-hardware-allows">Switch 2 versions of FC and Madden NFL would aim to have feature parity</a> with other consoles "as much as the hardware allows".
</p>
<p>
"This is a new FC, with some genuine differences on- and off-pitch," our Chris Tapsell wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-sports-fc-25-review">Eurogamer's EA Sports FC 25 review</a>. "It's also the exact same FC it's always been."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>As shown on Nintendo's official store, <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Games/Nintendo-Switch-2-Edition/The-Legend-of-Zelda-Breath-of-the-Wild-Nintendo-Switch-2-Edition-2787250.html">The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild – Nintendo Switch 2 Edition</a> will cost £66.99 on its release, but those who already own the game on the original Switch can upgrade their copy for £7.99. This is the same for its sequel, <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Games/Nintendo-Switch-2-Edition/The-Legend-of-Zelda-Tears-of-the-Kingdom-Nintendo-Switch-2-Edition-2787249.html">Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</a>.</p>
<p>However, while <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Games/Nintendo-Switch-2-Edition/Kirby-and-the-Forgotten-Land-Nintendo-Switch-2-Edition-Star-Crossed-World-2787773.html">Kirby and the Forgotten Land - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition + Star-Crossed World</a> also retails for £66.99 via Nintendo, its upgrade back is £16.99. So, £9 more than <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/zelda-breath-of-the-wild-walkthrough-guide-tips-4857">Breath of the Wild</a>'s upgrade pack.</p>

<p>This is the same pricing as <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Games/Nintendo-Switch-2-Edition/Super-Mario-Party-Jamboree-Nintendo-Switch-2-Edition-Jamboree-TV-2785806.html">Super Mario Party Jamboree – Nintendo Switch 2 Edition ＋ Jamboree TV</a>. As with Kirby, the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-nintendo-direct-everything-announced">Switch 2</a> edition of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/super-mario-party-jamboree">Super Mario Party Jamboree</a> retails for £66.99, with an upgrade pack available for owners of the original game coming in at £16.99.</p>
<p>It is worth noting that while the Zelda games do both have new features arriving with their Switch 2 editions, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/achievements-can-be-earned-in-switch-2-editions-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-and-tears-of-the-kingdom">such as Zelda Notes</a>, Kirby does have new content coming, which <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-a-closer-look-at-kirby-and-the-forgotten-lands-remixed-switch-2-worlds">takes the form of a remixed campaign known as Star-Crossed World</a>.

			<p>English voice recording for Final Fantasy VII Remake part 3 may have already begun, judging from a recent social media post.</p>
<p>As reported on the <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/english-voice-recording-for-final-fantasy-vii-part-3-likely-underway.1172094/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ResetERA forums</a>, Cody Christian, who plays Cloud Strife in the Remake trilogy, recently shared an Instagram story with a caption that suggests the voice actor is recording lines for the character. Considering the story was confirmed to have been <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-remake-part-3-story-completed/">complete</a>d a few months back, it's not unlikely the script has also been finalized, thus allowing the voice recordings to begin.</p>
<p>Very little is known about the third part of the Final Fantasy VII Remake trilogy, except that its development started before Final Fantasy VII Rebirth launched last year on PlayStation 5. As already mentioned, it was confirmed a few months back that the plot for the game is complete, and the concept powering the final part of the trilogy is crucial. One of the features that will set the upcoming finale apart from its predecessor is the ability to explore the world with the Highwind airship, a feature the development team is fully committed to delivering without compromises. Hopefully, this means that even the regions that already appeared in Rebirth will receive some shakeup to make it interesting to revisit them.</p>
<p>While Final Fantasy VII Remake fans who own a PlayStation 5 had the chance to experience the second entry in the series last year, PC players were given the opportunity to play Final Fantasy VII Rebirth only this year. The wait, however, was worth it, also thanks to modders who are introducing features not available in the vanilla game, such as additional <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth-new-mods-new-playable-characters/">playable characters.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/original-oblivion-designer-says-the-word-remaster-doesnt-do-justice-to-the-new-release/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Ever since we learned via rumors and leaks that Oblivion was returning, it was unclear whether it would be a remaster or remake. The initial wording found in Bethesda's internal documents <a href="https://wccftech.com/oblivion-fallout-3-remasters-leaked-alongside-dishonored-3-ghostwire-tokyo-sequel-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shared</a> during the Microsoft vs. FTC trial mentioned a remaster, but then we <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remake-rumors-intensify-as-details-on-the-improvements-emerge-in-new-report/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">found out</a> that Bethesda had enlisted another developer (Virtuos, the same one that's doing Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater) to port the game to Unreal Engine 5 and make several improvements to areas such as combat, leveling, user interface,</p>
<p>Indeed, after the <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered-looks-gorgeous-and-its-out-now/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">unveiling and launch</a> earlier this week, many were surprised at the amount of work that had been done. One of them was original The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Design Director Bruce Nesmith, who became Lead Designer of Skyrim and also worked on Starfield before leaving Bethesda in September 2021 to pursue a career as a book author. <a href="https://www.videogamer.com/features/original-elder-scrolls-oblivion-designer-was-floored-by-new-release-im-not-sure-remaster-does-it-justice/?callback=in&amp;code=ZTGYZMU0ZTETM2I4NS0ZOGU3LTGXMJETMZIXY2IZOGFINWMX&amp;state=e74208805f8a402a906dbd7c2f353923" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Speaking to Videogamer</a>, he said this is closer to 'Oblivion 2.0' than a mere remaster:</p>
<p><em>I spent a lot of years working on that game. A lot of blood, sweat, and tears went into it, along with everybody else on the team. And I intimately knew every single scene that they were showing. And they looked amazing.</em></p>
<p><em>I was assuming this was going to be a texture update. I didn’t really think it was going to be the complete overhaul that they’ve announced it to be… I would not have batted an eye at that. But to completely redo the animations, the animation system, put in the Unreal Engine, change the leveling system, change the user interface. I mean, that’s, you’re touching every part of the game. That’s a staggering amount of remastering. It almost needs its own word, quite frankly. I’m not sure 'remaster' actually does it justice. The closest that could come to categorizing it is Oblivion 2.0.</em></p>
<p>Interestingly, the new game is also <a href="https://wccftech.com/oblivion-remastered-seems-to-be-rather-well-suited-to-mods-and-one-of-them-adds-ray-reconstruction/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">heavily moddable</a>. While its graphics run on Unreal Engine 5, the game logic is still powered by the original engine, so several original mods are being ported right now. This could pave the way to many further improvements from the already thriving modding community. There are already 270 mods on Nexus, and it's just the beginning.</p>
<p>Do you agree with Nesmith's statement? Vote in the poll and let us know below.</p>

<p>Personally, I have quite a soft spot for the Sims 4 Island Living pack. This is the one set on Sulani, and it gives Sims 4 players the chance to live out their tropical beachy dreams. Please hand me a cocktail with an umbrella in it right now. Cheers! </p>
<p>Another personal favourite of mine from this batch of leavers is <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/batman-arkham-knight">Batman: Arkham Knight</a>.

<p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/ghostrunner">Ghostrunner</a>, meanwhile, is a fast-paced cyberpunk action game our Bertie called a "constant joy to play".</p>
<p>"Ghostrunner is a game about the joy of movement, and I love how it never loses sight of that," he wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ghostrunner-review-an-exhilarating-display-of-acrobatic-first-person-platforming">Eurogamer's Ghostrunner review</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/24/frostpunk-1886-has-been-announced-by-11-bit-studios/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>11 bit studios has announced Frostpunk 1886, an expanded remake of the original Frostpunk. The name Frostpunk 1886 has been chosen in reference to the in game lore, when the Great Storm first hit New London. Frostpunk 1886 is going to built up in Unreal Engine 5, bringing the original up to new standards along with additional content.</p>
<p><iframe title="Frostpunk 1886 | New Game Announcement" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/q9fw6_MvSss?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Frostpunk 1886 will introduce new gameplay mechanics, new laws, new content, and a new Purpose path for players to wander down. Additionally, Frostpunk 1886 will have mod support too. That was not possible in the original release of Frostpunk. 11 bit studio may also consider creating new DLC for Frostpunk 1886. Frostpunk 1886 has moved into development, but it will not release until 2027. 11 bit will continue to develop both Frostpunk 1886 and Frostpunk 2.</p>
<h2><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2018/05/03/frostpunk-review/">Frostpunk Review</a></h2>
<p>In our original Frostpunk review, Jason said, <em>“Frostpunk is a horrifyingly playable post-apocalyptic survival game that demands more out of you than most games ever could. Each decision and each sacrifice you make is hard on your city and on you. There are so many impossible choices and no win situations that the game is almost hard to play, but it’s so compelling that you will be unable to step away from it. The only real negative is the sheer overwhelming nature of the world the game is set in, and really that is more of a compliment to the designers than anything else. Frostpunk is a truly harrowing game in the best possible way and one that will have you steeped in the harsh reality of eternal winter for dozens of hours to come.”</em></p>

			<p>According to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/unannounced-blade-runner-game-canceled-supermassive-games/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Insider Gaming</a>, Guildford-based game developer Supermassive Games recently canceled an unannounced game based on the Blade Runner IP.</p>
<p>The game was allegedly titled Blade Runner: Time To Live. It would have been a "character-driven, cinematic, action-adventure game" set in 2065. The plan was to make a "compelling story that blends the philosophical themes of Blade Runner with kinetic action-adventure gameplay," with an expected length between 10 and 12 hours.</p>
<p>Blade Runner: Time To Live started pre-production in September 2024 and was being worked on by the team that made <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-quarry-supermassive-big-screen/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Quarry</a>. Pre-production was supposed to be completed in March 2025, while prototyping was scheduled to end around six months later.</p>
<p>The game's release was tentatively planned for September 2027 on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC. Interestingly, the report also mentions a potential launch on next-generation PlayStation and Xbox platforms. However, it's hard to imagine that Supermassive would already know so much about Sony's and Microsoft's plans that they would be aware of whether the new consoles will be available then.</p>
<p>Blade Runner: Time To Live was projected to have a budget of approximately $45 million, with $9 million set aside for external performance capture and acting talent. Original music production, image rights, usage fees for actors, QA and game testing, localization, and any future DLCs would have to be budgeted separately.</p>
<p>The game would feature a replicant known as So-Lange as the playable character. It would start in New Zurich, with So-Lange tasked to 'retire' a dangerous leader of an underground replicant network called Rev. However, So-Lange would soon be betrayed and left for dead in a hostile environment. In terms of game mechanics, the report says it would have been possible to upgrade skills and abilities.</p>
<p>The reasons behind the early cancellation weren't detailed, although it is said that Blade Runner IP owner Alcon was to blame. Of course, this is just one side of a story that may never fully come to light. It's a shame, though, as Supermassive definitely has the chops to make an interesting adventure game set in this universe.</p>
<p>It's been a long time since there was any game set in this seemingly ripe setting. Thankfully, there's still Blade Runner 2033: Labyrinth, in development at Annapurna Interactive since 2022.</p>

While <em><a title="Games > Frostpunk 2 [8 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/frostpunk-2">Frostpunk 2</a></em> continues to forge ahead with free major content updates, a console launch, and downloadable content, this newly announced project marks a return to the franchise’s roots, offering both newcomers and longtime citizens of New London an evolved take on the harsh, morally challenging survival experience that started it all.</p><p>But <em>Frostpunk 1886</em>—so titled to honor a pivotal moment in the timeline of the universe, when the Great Storm descended upon New London—is no mere visual overhaul.

            <p>Developer 11 bit Studios has officially unveiled its new <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/frostpunk">Frostpunk</a> game.</p>
<p>It's called Frostpunk 1886, and is a revamped version of the original Frostpunk using Unreal Engine 5. However, 11 bit has said this release won't simply be a visual overhaul of the original. Rather, Frostpunk 1886 will include new content for players to discover, as well as new mechanics, laws, and an entirely new Purpose path.</p>
<p>The upcoming release - which is scheduled for 2027 - will also bring mod support with it, with the developer stating reimagining Frostpink in Unreal Engine "allows the game to become a living, expandable platform". That also means, future DLC is indeed a possibility.</p>
<p>All of this, 11 bit says, will offer up a "fresh" gameplay experience for even the "most seasoned" of Frostpunk-ers.</p>
<p>"The title marks the start of a new era for 11 bit studios - one focused on delivering in-house projects more frequently than ever before," the Frostpunk 1886 team said, promising more details in the coming months. Stay tuned!</p>

            <p>There's still no solid release date for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/subnautica-2">Subnautica 2</a>, but the studio making the fishy survival game have given folks a glimpse beneath the surface of development in a devlog video. There are shots of a bubbly submarine speeder pod, and a brief sighting of a sea creature that does an annoyed underwater bark at you, before headbutting something it doesn't like. We also get some idea of co-op, with footage of two players helping each other out - a feature that'll be new to this sequel.</p>

<p>"We've taken everything that we've learned from our experience on the previous games
and we've poured it into Subnautica 2," says Design Lead, Anthony Gallegos. The video shows the developers testing lots of stuff in Unreal Engine, like building bases, repairing vehicles, and scanning lifeforms. There's a little taster of what it'll be like to build things side by side with a pal - nothing new for survival games but a still novelty for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/subnautica">Subnautica</a>. The plan is to allow up to four players. </p>
<p>It's not a long video and it doesn't make huge waves in terms of its revelations but it does cause a few interesting ripples. One new thing in this sequel is that you'll "evolve your genetics to adapt your body for survival" in the water. And we get a hint of how that'll come about - the player scans some slime and finds "useful genetics", which your computerised assistant recommends you expose yourself to. Of course. What could go wrong?</p>
<p>I could get into every little detail hidden away in the video. I'm intrigued by the environments listed in Unreal, for example. The "Shallows" and "Plateaus" sound familiar to those who've played the first Subnautica (one of our <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-survival-games-on-pc">best survival games</a>). But the "Observatory" and the "Graveyard"? I would like to know more.</p>
<p>No. No. I should stop. Subnautica is best enjoyed when you <em>don't</em> know what's lurking out in the depths. All the beauty of Unknown Worlds' survival games comes from piecemeal discovery, in the slow methodical exploration that comes from unlocking a slightly swimmier set of flippers or a breathier oxygen tank, letting you go deeper and further than before. The studio has more of these "road to early access" devlogs planned, they say, but part of me wants to shut my eyes and wait. Subnautica 2 is coming out "later in the year", with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/subnautica-2-early-access-should-last-2-to-3-years-itll-launch-with-several-biomes-and-some-narrative">a few biomes and an incomplete story</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

This means players of Ultimate Team (FC’s most popular and controversial mode) can sell the rewards obtained in the Premium Pass to other players for in-game currency that can then be used to buy the next Premium Pass (assuming they earn enough coins from the sale of those items in the auction house, of course).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Rewards include a number of powerful cards, such as Immortal Icon Franck Ribéry, and powerful Evolution consumables that are used to improve cards you already own.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/04/24/fifa-1745484732457.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">FC's first ever paid season pass.

			<p>Imagine a world where Breath of the Wild was made without the financial force of Nintendo behind it. Imagine that it was made by a team more interested in Star Wars than in Lord of the Rings, and then imagine that rather than the ruins of Hyrule, it’s set in a vast, deserted alien world. The game you’re imagining is Star Overdrive.</p>
<p><iframe title="Star Overdrive - Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FMGJHsO_pR0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>If you’re looking for shorthand, Star Overdrive is an indie sci-fi Breath of the Wild. There’s a place where that could be my review, but, this is not that place, so I’d better provide you with a touch more context.</p>


<p>Coming from the team at Caracal Games, and published by indie powerhouse Dear Villagers, Star Overdrive is a third-person adventure where you become Bios, a hoverboard and headphone-toting space farer who’s searching for his lost girlfriend, Nous.</p>
<p>That search takes you to the distant and mostly deserted planet of Cebete, a vast wasteland where metal ruins leer hungrily out of the sand, and the vast bones of ancient creatures lie bleached by the sun. It’s all presented in Breath of the Wild-esque cel-shaded visuals, though there’s much more wasteland here than there ever was in Hyrule. It’s definitely an attractive game, managing to do a lot with a little. The azure blue skies and sandy strata are enhanced by dust particles, gusts of wind and the gleaming rings of nearby planets, and Cebete feels like a real and solid place.</p>

<p>It iss a quiet place, though, and the one thing that Caracal Games have absolutely captured is a sense of loneliness, of yearning, and of regret as Bios searches for Nous. Many moments are accompanied by the sound of the wind, with the odd atonal note or two, but you can feel quite alone. It enhances the worry and the desperation that Bios is experiencing though, and gives a unique sense of pace that its inspiration didn’t always have.</p>

<p>Much of the storytelling is delivered via Nous’s personal logs, each tape found amongst the decaying mining drills and forgotten biodomes of an abandoned mining operation. She’s clearly strong and independent, but it’s clear that the weight of her situation is becoming increasingly clear to her.</p>
<p>Our hero doesn’t immediately seem like an ideal choice. There’s a dose of Chris Pratt’s Starlord about Bios, as he rocks a cassette player, keytar-sword and over-ear headphones, and as you explore, you’ll find a series of cassette tapes beyond Nous’s logs. These each hold a classic rock-styled anthem, and while they’re enjoyable enough, they just don’t quite fit with the overarching sound design or the image they’ve constructed for Bios.</p>
<p>Andrea Federici’s excellent soundtrack mixes Vangelis-esque synth with sweeping Satriani-styled electric guitar, and this feels perfectly in tune with the rest of the game. Stylistically, I wanted the additional musical numbers to sit somewhere between Synthwave and Metalcore – something like Gunship or Bad Omens perhaps – but I was left wanting</p>

<p>Bios’s hoverboard is his main source of transportation, and it’s one of the highlights of the game, letting you go boosting, jumping and tricking your way across the sand dunes. Your abilities are fundamentally tied to your hoverboard’s enhancements, and you can craft and build new parts for your board, making it faster, stronger and more manoeuvrable. As part of that, you’ll find a steady stream of races, time trials and collectathons that put your boarding skills to the test, and though they’re occasionally frustrating, overall they do a great job of breaking up the exploration.</p>
<p>Besides your hoverboard, you have a growing set of powers. As with other elements of Star Overdrive, these are heavily influenced by Breath of the Wild. Whether it’s a magnetic push and pull or the ability to freeze time, you have to utilise them to solve puzzles and traverse huge areas, and while they’re slavishly reminiscent of Nintendo’s green-clad hero, there’s enough cleverness and skill to make Star Overdrive feel like its own thing.</p>

<p>Not to sound like a broken record, but the Breath of the Wild comparisons become even more obvious with towers to climb to unlock the map, and shrine-like mining levels that further power up your character. The way they’re implemented may be a riff on Nintendo’s original work, but they’re done well enough that you can forgive it most of its foibles.</p>
<p>Those foibles include lacklustre combat – a chore made all the more annoying by a lack of an enemy lock-on – a few performance stutters, and a camera that is occasionally the wrong side of helpful.</p>
<p>Star Overdrive also makes a terrible habit of showing you the Game Over screen and playing a mournful few notes every time you make a mistake, when really it just means you’ve died and it’s going to reset you relatively near to where you were a moment ago. Caracal really should patch this out immediately because it’s ridiculous and silly, and the longer you play the game, the more it feels like a cruel joke.</p>

            <p>The long-rumoured <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bethesda-reveals-the-elder-scrolls-4-obivion-remake-gameplay">Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion remaster released earlier this week</a>, and fans have made a humorous yet oddly heartwarming discovery. That iconic line of an actor asking for a retake, that for some reason made it into the game's original release, is still there, alive and well in 2025.</p>
<p>On Oblivion Remastered's launch, Bethesda offered some clarification on why its new release is a remaster, and not a full fat remake. "We never wanted to remake it - but remaster it - where the original game was there as you remember playing it, but seen through today's technology," <a href="https://x.com/BethesdaStudios/status/1914718584414089525/photo/1">Bethesda wrote in a post on social media</a>.</p>
<p>And, well, the studio has indeed been true to its word with the discovery that Bethesda along with co-developer Virtuos has kept the famous and really rather cherished double take voice acting mistake which has been there since the original's release in 2006.</p>

<p>The line in question is spoken by, rather ironically, Master Speechcraft trainer and Altmer (a race of High Elves) Tandilwe.</p>
<p>While Tandilwe will offer master Speechcraft training during the game - that is to say, she will help you get your influence and persuade skill up - the voice actor herself flubbed a line during recording and asked for a retake (we've all been there!).</p>
<p>When Tandilwe is chatting to the player about thieves being pesky buggers, the voice actress breaks character, clearly not happy with the take, and asks "wait a minute, let me do that one again", before proceeding to indeed do the line again. And, Bethesda kept it in the original game.</p>
<p>You can check out the original version below.</p>

<p>Anyway, when Oblivion Remastered was announced,<a href="https://x.com/TheNCSmaster/status/1914371675132506375"> fans immediately wanted that now famous line to be part of the rerelease</a>. And, it was!</p>
<p>As shared on social media, "wait a minute, let me do that one again" is still there in all its glory, almost two decades later.</p>
<p>"This might be the most perfect remaster ever," wrote one user in a now viral X post, with accompanying footage. You can check it out below.</p> <div>

<p>Elsewhere in Elder Scrolls 4 news, there are<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/theres-already-almost-100-mods-for-oblivion-remake-even-without-official-support-from-bethesda"> now over 100 mods available for Oblivion Remastered</a>, covering things like armour, weapons and HUD improvements. That's even though <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bethesda-say-no-official-mod-support-for-its-oblivion-remaster">Bethesda has said it won't offer any official mod support</a>.</p>
<p>For more, earlier this month our Jim <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/remake-morrowind-not-oblivion-you-cowards">called upon Bethesda to remake Morrowind rather than Oblivion</a>. "You cowards," Jim wrote, calling Morrowind a "special game, where a beautifully unique fantasy setting is locked away behind technology and interface design that has aged particularly badly".</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
