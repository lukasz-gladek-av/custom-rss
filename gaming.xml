			<p>Xbox fans were certainly surprised to see from <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-outer-worlds-2-gameplay-showcased-at-the-game-awards-releases-in-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Game Awards 2024 trailer</a> that Obsidian's The Outer Worlds 2 was confirmed to launch immediately on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X. There's been a lot of conflicting talk about the multiplatform strategy, with Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-handheld-red-line-porting-games/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">stating </a>that there are no red lines when it comes to ports to other consoles, only for President of Content and Studios Matt Booty to <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-executive-says-exclusivity-will-be-considered-on-a-case-by-case-basis/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">say</a> a few days ago it would be evaluated on a case-by-case basis. Even Obsidian's 2025 games show that inner conflict, with Avowed only currently announced for PC and Xbox Series S|X.</p>
<p>However, Windows Central's Jez Corden confidently <a href="https://x.com/JezCorden/status/1867638349760196645" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tweeted on X</a> that real exclusives for Microsoft's console exclusives are essentially gone for good in the company's plans.</p>
<p><em>Xbox won't have exclusives going forward. Everything is timed exclusive at most. If some games are exclusive it's gonna be incidental at best, the "case by case" argument is by and large going to be multiplatform, timed, and with maybe a few (very few) outliers.</em></p>
<p>When asked about the exclusivity status of Playground's Fable (which is scheduled to launch sometime next year), he replied:</p>
<p><em>That game was monstrously expensive. It might not be day one, but it'll come with the current plan in place, in my opinion.</em></p>
<p>Where does that leave Xbox hardware, though? Corden believes it won't be shut down...Unless it <a href="https://wccftech.com/activision-boosts-microsot-q3-gaming-revenue-xbox-consoles-sales-collapse/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">continues to shrink</a> as it has over the past few quarters. In that case, all bets are off.</p>
<p><em>I don't think they'll stop providing hardware as long as the users and revenue are there. But growth is the issue. Without finding growth elsewhere, the shareholders won't accept it, especially with the 70 billion ABK scrutiny.</em></p>
<p><em>Don't think they'll shut it down. It'll just be flat. When you're a giant company with trillions in market cap, flat isn't viable. They need to grow beyond console for that, but maintaining what they have will power that effort. </em><em>If... it doesn't shrink. And it may well.</em></p>
<p>So far, out of the five Xbox exclusives announced for next year, only The Outer Worlds 2 and <a href="https://wccftech.com/doom-the-dark-ages-revealed-release-date-xbox-games-showcase/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DOOM: The Dark Ages</a> are already confirmed to launch on PlayStation 5, too. However, the likelihood of Fable, South of Midnight, and Avowed getting there is pretty high.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/atl-faze-roster-under-fire-cdl-loss/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>For the first time in 587 days, Atlanta FaZe has been dealt a 0 – 3 loss in the qualifying stage of a CDL Major. This loss came at the hands of a dominant Carolina Royal Ravens side, which succeeded in trapping FaZe in the hundred-point club during the opening Hardpoint, and it all went downhill from there.</p>



<p>Atlanta FaZe is now 0 – 3 in the qualifiers and has failed to secure a single CDL Point since the 2025 season kicked off. Typically, Atlanta FaZe is the single-most successful team on the board in the regular season, but right now, they’re on par with the Vegas Falcons.</p>



<p>Is it time for a roster change?</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-paradigm-shift">Paradigm Shift</h2>



<p>Since the Call of Duty League became a thing in 2020, Atlanta FaZe has been a stalwart force in the scene. The squad, comprised of Simp, aBeZy, Cellium, and <strong>someone else</strong> (Drazah since last season), has been a team to be reckoned with for the longest time, but this season has started with such a sour mood that questions are now being asked.</p>



<p>In the Cold War season, Atlanta peaked, winning three Major tournaments and the CDL Championship. In the year that followed, the squad didn’t secure a single victory, and when Modern Warfare II arrived, only one Major win was lined up for the team.</p>



<p>This year, FaZe made history by winning the first Esports World Cup in the Call of Duty MP category, but coming in off that win has meant little for the squad, starting this CDL 2025 season with three heavy losses.</p>











<p>In a historic loss, Atlanta FaZe fell to the Royal Ravens. The opening Hardpoint set the tone for the series, with FaZe losing P2 on 42 points and securing just 88 points by the time the match had ended. Between the second rotation from P1 to P4, the team picked up just 24 points, counting themselves lucky to even find the final scraps on the hills.</p>



<p>Do you think a change is needed, or do Atlanta FaZe just need to find their fit in Black Ops 6?</p>

		<p>Dead of Darkness is a new 2D survival horror that is looking to kick off 2025 with some fear. Developer Retrofiction Games has announced that its take on the horror genre will be released on January 23rd, and it is coming to PC via Steam. You will see from the trailer that Dead of Darkness features lots of different horror elements including body horror, jump scares, and a creepy child.</p>
<p><iframe title="Dead of Darkness - Release Date Trailer (2D Survival Horror Action Adventure in Pixel Art)" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mgkquIEORjM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Dead of Darkness is set on the fictional English island known as Velvet Island, and the year is 1985. The main character is private investigator Miles Windham, who has travelled to the island to find out why his sister died there. On its facade, the institution on Velvel Island is a hospital, but strip away that layer and it is a place of horror not healing. Much of the game will be based around puzzle solving, though there will be combat too in a bid to escape from various enemies and creatures. Some enemies will continue to pursue you so you will have to get away from them, and watch out. There are 15 characters that are on Velvet Island that have their own stories to tell too. Resource management will be a key focus in Dead of Darkness as there are not many items that will be available to help, so every encounter has to be planned for. Miles’ mental state will also have a toll taken on it, the more powerful the hallucinations he will experience. As a investigator, Miles will need to piece together clues found around Velvet Island to discover its secrets, and work out what happened to his sister.</p>
<p>Dead of Darkness is available to wishlist and you can grab a demo through the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2157210/Dead_of_Darkness/">Dead of Darkness Steam</a> page.</p>

<p>The Game Awards 2024 was raised in celebration of the tenth anniversary of the showcase. It was an ambitious event all around, and many viewers rated it higher than any iteration in history. Collectively, we saw dozens of awards handed out (which not everyone agreed with, admittedly) and many games either revealed or updated with new trailers.</p>



<p>It has been revealed in data collected by Streams Charts that this year’s The Game Awards was the most-watched edition ever, topping more than <strong>four million </strong>concurrent viewers. The growth was aided by co-streamers and watch parties, which are fast becoming some of the most entertaining ways to watch streams online.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-bigger-than-ever">Bigger Than Ever</h2>



<p>The Game Awards played host to some massive announcements and trailers, such as The Witcher 4, Naughty Dog’s new game, a new Virtua Fighter, and Mafia: The Old Country.</p>



<p>It was potentially the most electric edition of The Game Awards we’ve ever seen, and Geoff Keighley’s team spared no expense in piecing together an all-singing, all-dancing event featuring a star-studded lineup of guests.</p>



<p>In a report published <a href="https://streamscharts.com/news/game-awards-2024-recap" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">by Streams Charts</a>, it was revealed that The Game Awards (across top channels) racked up a combined peak concurrent viewership of 4,003,578 users. It had a total watched hours count of 15,267,555, and 1,498 channels were logged broadcasting the event in some way.</p>



<p>In total, The Game Awards was on air for just south of five hours, and while the top channels for the broadcast were the official ones, the likes of IGN, Asmongold, and Moist Cr1TiKaL pulled in massive audiences while reacting to the showcase.</p>



<p>How did you rate this year’s The Game Awards? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/when-cdl-skins-coming-to-black-ops-6/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/when-are-the-cdl-skins-coming-to-black-ops-6.1061787/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/when-cdl-skins-coming-to-black-ops-6/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>On November 12, Activision revealed the full line-up of CDL skins, but fans worldwide are <strong>still waiting </strong>for them to be delivered in Black Ops 6. While this year’s CDL skins aren’t as gaudy or ‘interesting’ as they have been in recent years, fans are still eager to represent their favourite CDL teams in Black Ops 6.</p>



<p>With that being said, when <strong>are </strong>the CDL skins coming to Black Ops 6, and how much will they cost when they arrive?</p>



<p>Read on to find out what we know.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-cdl-skins-release-date-in-black-ops-6">CDL Skins Release Date in Black Ops 6</h2>



<p>It hasn’t been confirmed by Activision when the CDL skins will be released in Black Ops 6.</p>



<p>If we use last season’s release schedule as a representative example, we can determine that it might still be a couple of weeks until they arrive.</p>



<p>Last season, the action commenced on December 8, 2023, and the MWIII CDL skins were released on January 8, 2024. </p>



<p>The current season started on December 6, so it could be the first week of January that the team skins arrive once again. It was mentioned that it would be ‘later in season one’ that the CDL skins would drop, and that’s more or less where we are now that the ‘Season One Reloaded’ update has arrived.</p>



<p>If you’re holding out to know when the CDL skins are coming to Black Ops 6, take note – it could be another few weeks.</p>



<p>Which skin will you be purchasing once they’ve dropped? There isn’t much variation between the various CDL skins this year, but it’s still nice to see the teams represented, and of course, the organisations benefit from the sale of the skins.</p>



<p>On that note, how much do the CDL skins cost?</p>



<p>Typically, a CDL skin pack – which comes with the base skin, weapon camos, stickers, emblems, and calling cards, retails in the COD store for around $11.99. They can’t be purchased with COD Points – only real-world money.</p>



<p>Let us know which team you’re representing in Black Ops 6 when the CDL skin packs drop.</p>

<p>TSM has announced the benching or dismissal of its Danish Counter-Strike 2 roster ahead of the 2025 season. In a post on social media, the organisation revealed an intention to ‘evaluate roster moves’ before the next year of competitive events kicks off.</p>



<p>To that end, Valde, niko, and Rejin (coach) have all been let go, while sirah, acoR, and Zyphon have been benched pending further decisions. The players aren’t sitting around and waiting, though – acoR has already taken to socials to announce his decision to seek a new team.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-it-is-what-it-is">‘It Is What It Is’</h2>



<p>Speaking on social media about the sudden decision, Frederik ‘acoR’ Gyldstrand wrote:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We didn’t get the players that were planned when I joined the team which did make the start feel weird.</p>



<p>We had a decent period i nthe start, we managed to make the RMR with no time to practice.</p>



<p>After the benching of Altekz it took a long time to get back on track with sirah. Though it did feel like we were getting back on track in the end, but <strong>it is what it is</strong>.</p>



<p>I am looking for a new team.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It was just a few days ago that TSM brought to an end the all-female CS2 team, TSM Impact. However, it’s worth stressing that this is a different scenario, as TSM intends to stay in the CS2 scene with a male team, but it’s not yet known what that squad will look like when the 2025 season opens up.</p>



<p>On social media, <a href="https://x.com/tsmreport/status/1867990639188791782" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">TSM simply wrote</a>:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Today we part ways with Valde, niko, and a CS Head Coach Rejin. We would like to thank them for their hard work throughout the year, and wish them all the best going forward.</p>



<p>We have also opted to bench sirah acoR, and Zyphon while we evaluate our next roster moves ahead of the 2025 season.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>What do you think the future of TSM looks like in Counter-Strike? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a></p>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/greedfall">Greedfall</a> 2 developer Spiders is taking the end of the year as an opportunity to "reflect on our journey so far" and said it is "committed to building a great game alongside [the community] and listening to your invaluable feedback".</p>
<p>In an update posted to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1997660/view/554602728738784050">Steam</a>, Spiders said "a lot has happened since the start of Early Access", but the team is "thrilled" about progress to date, despite it being a challenging experience that has seen Update 0.2 delayed with still no firm release date.</p>

<p>"[The decision to delay Update 0.2] allows us to focus on implementing significant improvements and fixes based on your feedback," the team said. "These include the combat system - which is as important to you as it is to us - the UI, character customisation, optimisation, and many other aspects."</p>
<p>This means Update 0.2 will not introduce a slew of changes, but instead the improvements will be "implemented gradually" over time.</p>
<p>"We wish we could provide a release date, but we would rather wait until we're certain," the team added. "What we can promise is that our priority remains delivering a game that meets your expectations and takes your feedback into account."</p><p>The update also explained that Spiders was working behind the scenes to address issues with Alivda's voice lines, and whilst the original voice actor was unable to reprise the role, it was working with a new artist to get the lines re-recorded and switched in "the next update".</p>
<p>"Ensuring your voices shape this journey has always been the goal of Early Access," the update concluded.</p>
<p>Shortly after Greedfall 2 released in early access on Steam, the Greedfall team <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/greedfall-2-is-addressing-two-important-subjects-combat-and-character-customisation">said the early access launch had been "exciting", but acknowledged improvements were needed</a>, including improving the drop rate, adjusting AI behaviours, and making dialogue scenes "less blurry".</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/m0nesy-g2-eliminated-faze-shanghai/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>G2 Esports has officially been eliminated by FaZe Clan at the Perfect World Shanghai Major. Tomorrow, FaZe Clan will face off against a dominant Team Spirit, and it could be a day that makes history, with $500,000 sitting on the line for the grand victor.</p>



<p>It has been a whirlwind tournament thus far, and many competitors have gone home with their heads hung in disappointment. One player who felt the blow this weekend was G2’s Ilya ‘m0NESY’ Osipov, who parted ways with a message of sore emotions following his loss.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-faze-clan-vs-spirit-for-it-all">FaZe Clan vs. Spirit For It All</h2>



<p>FaZe Clan wiped out G2 with a 2 – 0 win in Shanghai to qualify for the grand final against Team Spirit.</p>



<p>It was a wash on the first map, but G2 showed up a little tighter in the second round – but it wasn’t enough, unfortunately. In a slick finish, FaZe Clan’s Robin ‘ropz’ Kool came out to play, racking up 50 kills across the two maps and cementing himself as one to watch in the grand final.</p>



<p>M0NESY took it hard, though, taking to social media to write:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I can’t find the words to describe my feelings. I’m very angry with myself, forgive me for my terrible performance this month. This is the end and the beginning of something new.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Everyone wants to see if Team Spirit’s donk will have what it takes to achieve the incredible and win a CS2 Major during his rookie season. It has been a phenomenal year for the young star thus far, and securing the top spot in Shanghai would be a fantastic way to close out 2024.</p>



<p>He’s not alone in those aspirations, though. On FaZe Clan’s side, David ‘frozen’ Čerňanský is also seeking his first Major win.</p>



<p>FaZe Clan might be coming in hot off a win, but this year has been a tough one for the squad against Team Spirit. In terms of head-to-head, Team Spirit has managed to overcome FaZe Clan three times in the last 12 months.</p>



<p>If I was a betting man, my money would be on Team Spirit to secure the Major win.</p>

My expectation and fear was that developer MachineGames’ AAA action-adventure adaptation of the popular franchise starring Harrison Ford would play mostly like <em>Uncharted</em>, but in the ‘30s and with more Nazis. Thankfully, <em>Great Circle</em> is nothing like <em>Tomb Raider</em>, <em>Uncharted</em>, or the countless other games that have been directly inspired by Spielberg’s iconic ‘80s adventure films. Instead, <em>Great Circle</em> mixes <em>Hitman</em>-like stealth, <em>Dishonored</em>-like first-person gameplay, and some escape room puzzle design to create a unique, open-ended experience that feels both fresh and yet distinctly like Indiana Jones. - Zack Zwiezen <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/indiana-jones-great-circle-review-is-it-good-pc-xbox-1851717174&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/indiana-jones-great-circle-review-is-it-good-pc-xbox-1851717174">Read More</a></span></p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="ec57c7ab74aadacd08df413b08e3da86" data-recommend-id="image://ec57c7ab74aadacd08df413b08e3da86" data-format="jpg" data-width="1411" data-height="794" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Kratos stands on a city street." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Kratos stands on a city street." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Amazon / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="ec57c7ab74aadacd08df413b08e3da86" data-recommend-id="image://ec57c7ab74aadacd08df413b08e3da86" data-format="jpg" data-width="1411" data-height="794" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Kratos stands on a city street." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><span><a data-ga="[]" href="https://www.amazon.com/salp/secretlevel?asc_campaign=kinjakotakulink-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://kotaku.com/indiana-jones-great-circle-review-marvel-rivals-1851720877&amp;asc_source=&amp;tag=kinjakotakulink-20" target="_blank" rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer nofollow noskim" data-vtas-click="self:InlineUrl:inline-url-postbody" data-amazonasin="" data-amazontag="kinjakotakulink-20"><em>Secret Level</em></a></span>, Amazon’s stunningly animated video game anthology tribute, is either a gorgeous, impactful vehicle through which some short stories are told or a soulless piece of capital C Content, depending on which episode you’re watching. - Kenneth Shepard <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/secret-level-review-amazon-playstation-pac-man-mega-man-1851716804&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/secret-level-review-amazon-playstation-pac-man-mega-man-1851716804">Read More</a></span></p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="2229f739dad206bb6bc81ddf5168ee54" data-recommend-id="image://2229f739dad206bb6bc81ddf5168ee54" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Art shows the top RPGs of 2024.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/14/24320757/infinity-nikki-review-gacha-dress-up-game<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content"><p>You know that flavor of internet conversation where one familiar item is identified as another, wholly different item in a way that shouldn’t make sense but weirdly does? Like how <a href="https://www.eater.com/2017/7/24/16019500/hot-dog-sandwich-controversy-lol">a hot dog could be classified as a sandwich</a>, or because it has a filling enclosed by dough, a Pop-Tart is ravioli. Despite <a href="https://infinitynikki.infoldgames.com/en/home"><em>Infinity Nikki</em></a>’s looks of a high-quality dress-up gacha game, it is actually <em>Breath of the Wild</em> reborn in some fancy-ass clothes.</p><p>In the game, you play as Nikki, an ordinary girl who gets whisked away to the fantasy world of Miraland along with her talking, bipedal, pantsless cat Momo. In Miraland, fashion is magic and a guild of stylists use it to combat the world’s evils and one another.</p><div><p>I had issues with its clunky, unintuitive, and at times unresponsive control scheme.</p></div><p><em>Infinity Nikki </em>having so much in common with <em>Breath of the Wild</em> was not immediately obvious. I started out disliking the game immensely. I had issues with its clunky, unintuitive, and at times unresponsive control scheme. The menu icon is in the top-right corner of the screen but is opened by holding the <em>left </em>shoulder button. But when you open the radial menu, you can only highlight icons with the right thumbstick. The direction pad is straight-up not functional, and while you use the X button to confirm selections, circle is used to click through dialogue. It’s a mess and a platform switch between mobile and PS5 didn’t address this at all.&nbsp;</p><div><p>There is an issue with linking accounts on PlayStation that could result in being unable to use cross-progression. This <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/how-link-accounts-infinity-nikki"><em>Eurogamer</em></a> article explains the confusing details. To avoid any issues, before your first<em> Infinity Nikki</em> session on any platform, make an Infold Games account on their <a href="https://account.infoldgames.com/login">website</a> and use that to sign in where you like.</p></div><div><p>Control issues aside, <em>Nikki</em> then rubbed up against my antipathy for gacha games. I don’t hate them outright despite their reputation for having the same kind of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/19/18226852/loot-boxes-gaming-regulation-gambling-free-to-play">predatory design elements</a> that led to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/12/19/16783136/loot-boxes-video-games-gambling-legal">crackdowns on lootboxes</a>. Rather, I’ve found them to be either <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24195175/zenless-zone-zero-impressions-genshin-impact-mihoyo">completely impenetrable</a> with their thousand million progression systems and currencies layered over utterly banal gameplay, or <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/6/1/23150381/diablo-immortal-preview-mobile-activision-blizzard">so naked in their core purpose to extract my time and money</a> that they turn me off. At first blush,<em> Infinity Nikki</em> felt like that.</p></div><p><small>In addition to exploration and fashion battles, Infinity Nikki is filled with all kinds of mini-games that provide an entertaining break from gameplay like this take on <em>Flappy Bird. </em></small></p><p>But as I was running through a pastoral countryside, gentle piano music playing at a default volume a few notches below a whisper, I spied a golden twinkle in the distance. I found a plant I could collect. Then another. Then Momo, who is basically the mobile game version of <em>Persona 5</em>’s Morgana, told me something called a “whimstar” was nearby. I found it at the top of a rocky cliff, requiring some light platforming to reach. From the elevation, I saw a treasure chest, so I used my bubble outfit to gently glide toward it before changing into my purification outfit to dispatch the monsters guarding it. Once they were gone, I saw a bug I could collect with the new bug catcher’s outfit I had just made. Then I…&nbsp;</p><p>It’s easy to read this and think that all <em>Infinity Nikki</em> has done is take <em>BOTW</em> and stuff it with microtransactions (which I’ll get to later). But by the time I had my, “Oh shit. This is <em>Zelda</em>,” revelation, it didn’t feel like a cheap clone. The same pleasing jolt I got solving a Korok puzzle, I felt from getting a whimstar. And the dress-up mechanics added a layer of novelty that further enhanced the game and my enjoyment.</p><div><figcaption>Infinity Nikki has a seriously robust photo mode.</figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Infold Games</cite></p></div><p>Everything in <em>Nikki </em>is powered by fashion. There are special outfits, like my monster purification dress or bug catcher uniform, that impart abilities that let you traverse the map, collect materials, and fight monsters. You then use materials you’ve gathered from those activities to upgrade your ability outfits or obtain the clothing you want to customize your avatar. There are so many pieces of clothing and accessories, each one rendered in intricately beautiful detail, that you use to exude your own style and win fashion battles against other stylists.</p><p>After exploration, I had the most fun crafting outfits in fashion duels against NPC stylists. Each piece of clothing is assigned points in five categories: sweet, fresh, elegant, sexy, or cool. Whoever has the highest points in the designated categories wins. Since these battles are based on score, you can easily win wearing an ugly mishmash of high-value clothes – kinda like how I won my first battle. The experience was so rewarding that it made me want to try winning future battles with looks that are both high-scoring and high-fashion.&nbsp;</p><div><figcaption>The absolute atrocity with which I won my first stylist duel.</figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Infold Games</cite></p></div><p>To borrow a phrase from <em>Final Fantasy XIV</em>, <a href="https://www.rpgfan.com/feature/in-final-fantasy-xiv-glamour-is-the-true-endgame/">“Glamour is the endgame.”</a> It means that you’re not playing to become powerful or beat the game, you’re playing solely to fund your fashion habit. And it’s surprisingly not expensive.</p><p>Despite<em> Nikki </em>being a gacha game that is, at its core, designed to get you to spend money, its monetization systems feel more vestigial than critical. Most gacha games never require players to spend money, but are usually designed such that you can’t help it. Core game activities are arbitrarily limited and if you want to keep playing, you have to pay up. From what I’ve seen after 15 hours,<em> Nikki</em> doesn’t have that.&nbsp;</p><p>Dressing up is the core feature and there’s a cash shop where you can spend money on consumables that give you the chance (known as “pulling” in the gacha community) of winning high-value, tantalizingly pretty clothes. But there are so many other, cash-free ways to get outfits that are just as pleasing as anything for sale.&nbsp;</p><p>You can make a look out of mixing and matching pieces from your ability outfits, earn clothing or the blueprints to make them from quest rewards, or simply buy stuff from in-game vendors with in-game cash. I was not a fan of all the lace, sparkles, and pastels I made for my first outfit that I considered tossing a few bucks into the fashion slot machine. But as I continued my magpie-like adventures I made a punk rock look I’d actually wear in real life without spending a dime. It felt like the shop is only there for the folks who just have to have the exclusives it offers.</p><div><figcaption>An example of the kinds of clothing you can “pull” for with Infinity Nikki’s gacha mechanic.</figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Infold Games</cite></p></div><p>I enjoyed how <em>Infinity Nikki </em>subverted my expectations. A gacha game managed to recreate <em>Breath of the Wild</em> in function and spirit while the depth and detail of the fashions spoke directly to my love of individual expression in games. It wasn’t simply an Unreal Engine 5 version of the dress-up games of the early internet but a spiritual, sartorial successor of one of the best games of the last decade.</p><p><small><em>Infinity Nikki </em>is available now on Android, iOS, PlayStation, and PC.</small></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>The Game Awards 2024 <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-iv-gets-first-trailer-showing-off-cirilla/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">opened</a> with a stunning six-minute pre-rendered cinematic trailer (powered by NVIDIA's GPU about to be <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-geforce-rtx-50-gaming-ces-2025-teaser/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> at CES 2025) of The Witcher IV, the first installment in the new saga.</p>
<p>The trailer confirmed what most fans had surmised following the ending of Wild Hunt: Cirilla will be the protagonist of the new saga rather than Geralt. <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/inside-the-witcher-4-cd-projekt-reds-plans-for-its-next-big-rpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Speaking to IGN</a>, CD Projekt RED developers commented on this choice, starting with Cian Maher (franchise and lore designer), who said:</p>
<p><em>‘The Witcher’ as a title refers to both Geralt and Ciri and always has. I think she's arguably more important to the plot than Geralt himself is.</em></p>
<p>They wouldn't say anything more about Geralt, although it seems unlikely he wouldn't appear in some capacity in The Witcher IV. Anyway, Game Director Sebastian Kalemba added in the interview that Cirilla's relatively new enrollment as a professional Witcher also means she still has to develop her own code for dealing with the various situations. This, in turn, will increase the player's agency in the game.</p>
<p><em>Since I can remember, we've been talking about Ciri and how much she deserves her own journey. I love this grit in her. She's almost obsessed with the way she lives. There are some moments where you have to go with your heart instead of always going with the calculated calls. And this is what I love in Ciri. She's less calculating, following her heart, her passion, her gut feel.</em></p>
<p><em>We want to let players try to define her. She's about to form her own codex on her own terms. The way she actually deals with the monsters, the way she deals with quests, the adventures, it's her own unique way. We want to put player agency at the center. We’re giving more tools for players' disposal, to be able to not only play and go with the consequences narratively but also gameplay-wise. We want to give players more opportunities to be able to feel that they define their experience.</em></p>
<p>Kalemba then admitted that Cyberpunk 2077 had more varied gameplay than The Witcher 3, and it's an area where the studio wants to improve in this upcoming title.</p>
<p><em>I believe the gameplay in Cyberpunk 2077 was more varied than in The Witcher 3, and it allowed more freedom when it comes to creating character builds and being able to experience encounters in your own way. This is something we definitely want to bring as a lesson to The Witcher IV. We want to improve on The Witcher 3's gameplay, but also we want to improve the alignment of the way you will be able to explore the world.</em></p>
<p>CD Projekt RED also told IGN that the TGA 2024 trailer underwent many revisions as the studio sought to ensure that every frame had its own meaning for fans to discover.</p>
<p>The Witcher IV has no release window. If we had to guesstimate, we'd put it between late 2026 and early 2027, so prepare for a long wait.</p>

<p><em>G-STAR was our first event in Korea. It was incredibly opening to just how prevalent gaming culture is there. Not only did we get to enjoy the convention that was stacked with game devs, but we also had the opportunity to talk to some of our biggest names like Jang Wonyoung and Kim Yeji.</em></p>



<h3 id="h-six-invitational-brazil">Six Invitational (Brazil)</h3>



<p><em>This event likely had one of the best esports environments we will ever witness. The arena in Sao Paolo was full of energy with fans bringing in flags and drums, and the final matchup included two twin brothers, both from Brazil, on opposing teams.</em></p>



<h3 id="h-esports-world-cup-saudi-arabia">Esports World Cup (Saudi Arabia)</h3>



<p><em>The Esports World Cup was one of the events we were able to get the most up close and personal with, meeting competitors from both Warzone and League of Legends. For Warzone, we were able to organise interviews with competitors like JoeWo, Breadman, and Jukeyz, as well as getting to see the Falcons dominate and entertain with some trash talk.</em></p>



<h3 id="h-evo-united-states">EVO (United States)</h3>



<p><em>This was the first EVO we attended, and it didn’t disappoint. EVO is run in a really interesting way that encourages a bit more of the ‘roots’ of esports, where you have people crowding around random tables on the floor to watch as people compete, and it eventually builds up to a massive crowd watching the main stage. We were able to see Punk, Nitro, and SonicFox take home big, passionate wins.</em></p>



<h3 id="h-thunderpick-world-championship-germany">Thunderpick World Championship (Germany)</h3>



<p><em>The Thunderpick World Championship was hosted on an incredibly small scale, boiler room-esque venue. We witnessed The MongolZ take home the win alongside a crowd that absolutely favoured them and wasn’t afraid to show it.</em></p>



<p>What was your favourite esports or gaming event of 2024? For me, it was Gamescom in Cologne. This year marked my first attendance of the event and it was mind-blowing in every respect.</p>

<p>Following a stunning run in Shanghai that saw Team Spirit eliminate both Liquid and MOUZ, the squad has secured a prestigious place in the tournament’s grand final. The team will be joined by either FaZe Clan or G2 Esports once the remaining semi-final fixture wraps up in just a couple of hours.</p>



<p>It has been a stellar run thus far for Team Spirit, and the squad has contributed to some of the most-viewed matches in the tournament until now.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-everything-to-play-for">Everything To Play For</h2>



<p>The Perfect World Shanghai Major has a $500,000 grand prize waiting for the victor, and at this point, it could be Team Spirit, FaZe Clan, or G2 Esports that lifts the trophy. It has been a relatively close-matched event thus far, and some players are appreciative of the challenge.</p>



<p>For instance, FaZe Clan’s <a href="https://www.hltv.org/news/40552/karrigan-i-want-vitality-g2-and-spirit-why-not-make-it-the-hardest-major-playoff-run-ever" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Karrigan</a> – one of the most storied competitors in CS history – set out a path ahead of him and his team that many would fear:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I want Vitality. I want G2 in the semis, and I want Spirit in the final. That’s three teams we normally haven’t beaten the whole year, why not make it the hardest Major playoff run ever? I’m down for that.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Team Spirit’s qualification into the grand final wasn’t easy going for the squad. MOUZ put up a solid fight, particularly in the opening round on Nuke. This map saw Spirit’s prodigy, donk, secure his second-worst performance of the year, emerging with a rating of just 0.36 and a KD of 6 – 17.</p>



<p>The team regained, of course – and now they sit poised to secure the biggest single prize they’ve ever nabbed in Counter-Strike esports.</p>



<p>How do you think the grand final will unfold? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/huke-optic-kenny-pickup-cdl/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/%E2%80%98the-perfect-player-for-us%E2%80%99-optic-kenny-talks-about-huke%E2%80%99s-sudden-cdl-pickup.1061601/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/huke-optic-kenny-pickup-cdl/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>In recent days, the Call of Duty League scene has been up in arms about the widely debated sudden ‘dismissal’ of Pred from OpTic Texas. The rumours circulated like wildfire after the Australian pro player was removed from OpTic Texas’ starting roster and Cuyler ‘Huke’ Garland was picked up.</p>



<p>Last night, Huke debuted (again) with OpTic, going face-to-face with Vancouver Surge, his old team, and promptly impressing fans everywhere with how quickly he gelled with the team. In some ways, it was a homecoming for Huke – but some OpTic Texas fans are still displeased with how Pred is being treated in the wake of his removal.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-we-can-do-whatever-we-want">‘We Can Do Whatever We Want’</h2>



<p>In a post-match interview, OpTic’s Kenny, a two-time world champion, explained why Huke was such a solid pickup following the team’s win over Vancouver Surge:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I think Cuyler (Huke) was the perfect player for us.</p>



<p>We can do whatever we want because our pacing is just so fast.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Huke’s dominance was displayed perfectly during the fixture against Vancouver Surge. It wasn’t a close match-up by any means, with OpTic Texas losing the opening Hardpoint and then proceeding to wipe the floor with Surge at every given opportunity, starting with a 6 – 1 scoreline in Search.</p>



<p>Like Shotzzy, Huke has insane movement capabilities, and Black Ops 6’s Omnimovement mechanics have only served to heighten those in-game talents.</p>



<p>Of course, if Vancouver Surge had beaten OpTic Texas following the Huke pickup, fans in the Green Wall would have been singing a very different tune. Regardless of the circumstances, it would have been nothing but slander and accusations against the squad for dropping Pred.</p>



<p>Do you think grabbing Huke was a good move for OpTic Texas? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>
