		<p>Square Enix has announced that Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade will be launching on January 22nd for Switch, Xbox Series X|S, and Xbox on PC. Square Enix has also confirmed that Final Fantasy VII Rebirth, and the third game in the trilogy will be released for Switch 2 and Xbox Series X|S too, with more information for both to come at a later date.</p>
<p><iframe title="FINAL FANTASY VII REMAKE INTERGRADE - Release Date Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0eIb6WcuAeo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade will feature a streamlined progression setting that will allow players to get through the game faster. Each of the settings can be toggled on or off individually, with this being the list of those settings. Essentially, each of the settings make the game easier to get through, handy for those who just want to experience the story.</p>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>HP is always full</strong>&nbsp;– your HP is at its maximum value at all times. Even when hit by an enemy, your HP won’t go down. Instant death is also removed (sorry Tonberries!)</em></li>
<li><em><strong>MP is always full</strong>&nbsp;– your MP is always at its maximum value. Sling out spells with wild abandon!</em></li>
<li><em><strong>Limit gauge is always full</strong>&nbsp;– the Limit gauge is at maximum when you enter battle, and using powerful Limit Breaks won’t deplete it.</em></li>
<li><em><strong>ATB gauge is always full</strong>&nbsp;– your ATB gauge is always maxed out, so you can unleash abilities as much as you want without restriction!</em></li>
<li><em><strong>Damage dealt is always 9999</strong>&nbsp;– with this set on, you’ll do maximum damage with every attack. No boss can stand against you!</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Pre-orders for Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade are open too. In our <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/04/06/final-fantasy-vii-remake-review/">Final Fantasy VII Remake Review</a>, Tuffcub said, <em>“An utter joy to play from start to finish, packed with memorable scenes, moustache-twirling baddies, and epic battles. The first part of Final Fantasy VII Remake isn’t just polished, it’s opulent.”</em></p>
<p>While in our <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/06/17/final-fantasy-7-remake-intergrade-review-ps5/">Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade Review,&nbsp;</a>Nic said, <em>“You should absolutely get Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade. It’s easy to be critical and nitpick, but it’s worth remembering we’re looking at the DLC for one of the best and most-loved games of the PS4. The PS5 upgrade for Intergrade looks and feels incredible, and the chance to play as Yuffie is warmly received, especially when she completely changes the tone to something more light-hearted. However, the DLC isn’t quite perfect and, despite the filler, it feels very short for its price, especially if you’re not interested in the side missions.”</em></p>

<p>To avoid any confusion the Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade that is coming to Switch 2 and Xbox features the full game and INTERmission DLC.</p>

<p>It's the best one!</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>The really rather frightening <strong><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/fatal-frame-2-crimson-butterfly-remake">Fatal Frame 2: Crimson Butterfly</a></strong> is getting a fancy remake. Hooray! Team Ninja is involved. Hooray again! And it's headed to Switch 2 in 2026. Ok that's terrifying, but also hooray...we guess.</p>
<p>This Japanese horror effort, which scared this writer good and proper back when it released for the first time in 2003, is looking like a right atmospheric treat in its fancy new trailer, which you can check out above, and the creepy tale should benefit greatly from the added horsepower of the Switch 2, after a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wii/project_zero_2_wii_edition">Wii port</a> back in the day that was, well it was fine, but it wasn't the best way to play it.</p>

<p>From former Bungie CEO's new studio</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>We love the 80s. We love anime. We love them there computer games.</p>
<p>And so, it stands to reason, there's a fair chance we could end up loving <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/storm_lancers">Storm Lancers</a>, a rather retro-cool-looking 2D action roguelike that's available for Switch today. Exciting!</p>
<p>Today's surprise stealth drop, of a game that was <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/former-bungie-ceos-studio-probablymonsters-announces-storm-lancers-for-switch">announced a little while back now</a>, sees players blast through a campaign in either solo mode or couch co-op. It looks very like a 2D <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/borderlands_collection_pandoras_box">Borderlands</a> to us in its art style, weapon pick-up descriptions and enemies, which is no bad thing, and the trailer - which you can check out above - shows a decent mix of platforming, boss battling and so on.</p>
<p>The roguelike aspect here comes through the use of "storm hearts", hence the title, which can be upgraded through play for permanent unlocks to carry into your next run. Of course this is also the first game from ProbablyMonsters, so we're very interested to see how it turns out for them.</p>

We got <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/777071/super-mario-bros-movie-sequel-nintendo-direct-september-2025">a new trailer for the <em>Super Mario Bros Movie</em> sequel</a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/777095/so-can-yoshi-read">a new Yoshi game</a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/777084/things-are-heating-up">a new <em>Mario Tennis</em> game</a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/777097/what-even-is-this-thing">this weird thing</a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/777117/hades-2-release-date-september-nintendo-switch">a <em>Hades II </em>release date</a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/777159/pokemon-pokopia-nintendo-switch-2">a new <em>Pokémon</em> game</a>, and <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/777056/metroid-prime-4-release-date-nintend-direct-september-2025#comments">Metroid Prime 4</a></em>’s release date. But if that weren’t enough, and apparently it wasn’t according to Nintendo, the company has <em>also</em> revealed a first look at the latest <em>Fire Emblem</em> game titled <em>Fire Emblem: Fortune’s Weave</em>.</p></div><p>The reveal trailer gave us a glimpse of the world of <em>Fortune’s Weave</em>. The game features what looks to be the same kind of factional rivalries that made <em>Fates</em>, <em>Awakening</em>, and <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/25/20726336/fire-emblem-three-houses-review-nintendo-switch">Three Houses</a></em> so special. <em>Fortune’s Weave</em> also features totally new characters in a brand new setting that, so far, looks much more interesting than what <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23557639/fire-emblem-engage-nintendo-switch-review"><em>Fire Emblem Engage</em> had to offer</a>.</p><p>At the heart of <em>Fortune’s Weave</em> is the Heroic Games, a gladiator-like contest that will no doubt have massive implications on the wider story. <em>Fortune’s Weave</em> looks to have the same tactical RPG rock-paper-scissors combat that I love about the series including new combat units that have some gladiatorial flair. We’ll learn all <em>Fire Emblem Fortune</em>’s <em>Weave</em> has to offer when it launches on the Switch 2 some time next year.</p><p><span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/777187/fire-emblem-fortunes-weave-annoucement-trailer#comments"><span>0<!-- --> <!-- -->Comments</span></a></span></p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTAy"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Ash Parrish</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/777187/fire-emblem-fortunes-weave-annoucement-trailer]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/these-limited-edition-nfl-echo-dot-bundles-hit-an-all-time-low-right-as-the-football-season-kicks-off.1296318/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The weather is cooling down. The leaves will be changing soon. And football season has officially begun. Any true fan it’s going to have some memorabilia of their favorite team. Most of them just sit there for display, but not this. <strong>Amazon’s Echo Dot now comes bundled with miniature NFL helmets.</strong> There are 32 different options, one for each NFL team in these limited-edition bundles. And then beyond that, you have your choice of color for the Echo dot itself, coming in either charcoal, glacier white, or deep sea blue.</p>
<p>Amazon currently has a sale going on for the NFL Echo Dot bundle, but not for every team. Between each helmet and Echo Dot color, I’ve taken on the tedious task of clicking on all 96 combinations to confirm which are on sale and which are still full price. After going through the full league, I can confirm only one set is on sale—the Green Bay Packers. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4087/">All three color options for the Wisconsin team are $25 off, bringing the price down to just $85.</a> Cheeseheads get to live large this week. Sorry all other NFL fans in the country, but you’ll be paying full price for your team’s limited-edition NFL Echo Dot bundle.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4087/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Vibrant Sound, Small Package</h2>
<p>Why even get an Echo Dot in the first place? Well this smart speaker, despite it’s small stature, is capable of producing powerful sound with a rich and deep bass. It’s got a front-firing 1.73-inch speaker which pumps out room-filling audio.</p>
<p>Streaming from you Echo Dot, be it music, podcasts, or audiobooks, comes through with clear vocals. It uses lossless HD audio from a handful for streaming services, Amazon Music HD included. Beyond Amazon’s own stuff, the Echo Dot can play from Apple Music, Spotify, SiriusXM, and more. Control the volume or start and stop the track with simple voice commands.</p>



<p>Not just a speaker, the Echo Dot is first and foremost a smart home hub. You can control other smart products in your home by just asking Alexa. Use it to adjust settings on your TV. Change the lights from off to on or dim them without getting up from the couch. You can set cooking times, ask questions, create calendar events and so much more. You can even connect with family and friends who also have an Echo device or even just the Alexa app on their phone. Use multiple Echos to communicate between rooms of your house if you so please.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4087/">Come grab the NFL Echo Dot bundle (exclusively the Green Bay Packers edition) for the reduced price of $85.</a></p>

              <p>Today, Nintendo treated us to a lovely September Direct, kicking things off with a focus on the 40th anniversary of <em>Super Mario Bros.</em>&nbsp;Where does the time go? Naturally, we saw some&nbsp;<em>Mario</em> games expected to arrive on our Switch 2s and got our first glimpse of next year’s big-screen outing for the Bros. But there was also so, so much more.</p> <p>If you weren’t up at the crack of dawn to watch it yourself, allow us to give you the rundown. Let’s get to it.</p> <hr> <h2><em>The Super Mario Galaxy Movie</em></h2>  <p>Oh hey, <a href="https://kotaku.com/the-super-mario-galaxy-movie-spring-2026-2000625274">there’s a new&nbsp;<em>Mario&nbsp;</em>movie on the way</a>. We got the briefest of looks today at&nbsp;<em>The </em><em>Super Mario Galaxy Movie.&nbsp;</em>There wasn’t a whole lot shown or revealed besides the title and a quick camera sweep through the colorful world of Mario and the announcement that several cast members would be returning including, ugh, Chris Pratt.</p>

 <hr> <h2><em>Super Mario Galaxy&nbsp;</em>&amp;&nbsp;<em>Galaxy 2</em> Arrive On Switch</h2>  <p>If you were hungry for some Wii-era nostalgia, or just <a href="https://kotaku.com/super-mario-galaxy-2-switch-remaster-release-date-2000625275">missed out on the&nbsp;<em>Galaxy</em> games</a> of the era, Nintendo has good news you for you as it showed off the return of these two beloved titles and some new amiibos based on these adventures.</p> <p><strong><em>Super Mario Galaxy</em> &amp;&nbsp;<em>Galaxy 2&nbsp;</em>land on Switch on October 2.</strong></p> <hr> <h2><em>Mario Tennis Fever</em></h2>  <p>Mario and tennis go back a long way, and some of his outings on the court have been pretty great. Today we got a look at <em>Mario Tennis Fever </em>which includes not just a <em>Mario</em>-ified tennis experience as you might expect, but also an adventure mode that tasks the cast with surviving a tennis-themed adventure as babies.</p>

 <p><strong><em>Mario Tennis Fever </em>arrives on Switch 2 on February 12, 2026.</strong></p> <hr> <h2><em>Super Mario Bros. Wonder</em> Switch 2 Edition</h2>  <p><em>Wonder</em>‘s wonderfully surreal experience is coming to Switch 2 via a new edition. There’s a ton of new content coming to this version as well when it arrives next year. And Nintendo has produced some physical talking flowers which, um, will spontaneously talk on their own. Fascinating.</p> <p><strong><em>Super Mario Bros. Wonder</em> Switch 2 edition arrives in Spring 2026.</strong></p> <hr> <h2><em>Yoshi and the Mysterious Book</em></h2>  <p>Can Yoshi read? Turns out he can! <a href="https://kotaku.com/yosh-mysterious-book-yoshi-island-nintendo-direct-september-switch-2-2000625273">In <em>Yoshi and the Mysterious Book</em></a>, Yoshi’s gonna have to piece together the mysteries of a strange book that’s arrived. But what’s particularly cool about this game, aside from its interesting environmental puzzles, is its quasi-stop-motion-animation style that looks really nice.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Today was the first big <a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-direct-september-2025-switch-2-mario-yoshi-pokemon-2000625264">Nintendo Direct</a> to happen since the company <a href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-review-best-things-list-hate-love-nintendo-1851783873">launched the Switch 2 earlier this year</a>. 2025 is also the 40th anniversary of <em>Super Mario Bros.</em> So I was excited that the pre-recorded event started with a whole section dedicated to Mario. And then I was very sad.</p> <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/super-mario-odyssey-the-kotaku-review-1819856086"><em>Super Mario Odyssey</em> launched all the way back in 2017</a> as a very early Switch game. And it was great. A truly wonderful 3D platformer. There wasn’t a more perfect time than today for Nintendo to announce the next mainline 3D <em>Mario</em> game. But that didn’t happen.</p> <p>Instead, Mario’s dad, Shigeru Miyamoto, came out and talked about a marathon, some ticket designs, a theme park, a lightshow, an art museum, and then revealed the first look at the new <em>Mario</em> movie. I’d be fine with all that, except after showing off <em>The Super Mario Galaxy Movie,</em> Miyamoto said this:</p>

 <blockquote><p><a href="https://youtu.be/tpso9KkjylY?t=2039">“The movie will be the main event of the Super Mario Bros. 40th Anniversary event.”&nbsp;</a></p></blockquote> <p>Oh… well, uh, I guess that’s one way to celebrate video gaming’s most iconic character. And don’t worry, Chris Pratt is back to voice him.</p> <p>The rest of the section dedicated to Mario’s 40th Anniversary was a bit better. <em><a href="https://kotaku.com/super-mario-galaxy-2-switch-remaster-release-date-2000625275">Super Mario Galaxy 1+2</a></em> are coming to Switch and Switch 2. <em>Super Mario Wonder</em> is getting a Switch 2 upgrade and new co-op modes. And <em>Mario Tennis Fever</em> was revealed.</p> <p>But then, Nintendo had one more announcement. Finally, it was time to end this section all about Mario’s big milestone with the thing we all wanted. And then Nintendo announced… a (very cute-looking) Yoshi game.</p>

 <p>Welp, I guess no 3D <em>Mario</em> game is coming anytime soon. That’s a shame. And while I understand that<a href="https://kotaku.com/donkey-kong-bananza-dlc-roguelike-mode-out-today-switch-2-direct-2000625314"><em> Donkey Kong Bananza</em> likely is the reason,</a> and that game is awesome and I love it, I can’t help but feel like Mario’s 40th anniversary event was a dud.</p> <p>Call the police. Call the Mushroom Kingdom’s law enforcement agency. Put out a missing person report. Mario is missing folks, for real this time, lost in the ever-expanding ambitions of Nintendo, a company once dedicated to games, that now has its fingers in so many other things.</p>

		<p>A trio of Resident Evil games are heading to Nintendo Switch with Resident Evil 7, aka Resident Evil Biohazard, and Resident Evil 8, aka Resident Evil Village, all launching on the same day as the new game, Resident Evil Requiem.</p>
<p>You can read our hands of preview of<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/08/20/resident-evil-requiem-preview-first-person-frights-third-person-delights/"> Resident Evil Requiem here</a>, and there’s a handy video as well.</p>
<p><iframe title="Resident Evil Requiem Preview – First person frights, third person delights" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pIE471UnNVc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The ninth mainline Resident Evil game casts players as Grace Ashcroft who – as RE law dictates – finds herself embroiled in an apocalyptic scenario that has players running a gauntlet of jump scares as they peel back layers of a grander conspiracy.</p>

<p>Much like Resident Evil 7, and Village, Requiem will feature first person gameplay and visuals powered by Capcom’s silky smooth RE Engine. Instead of being chased by the shambling undead, Gamescom footage shows Grace and her mother escape the clutches of someone who appears to be a deranged serial killer. It’s definitely a change of direction for Resi though one that will no doubt loop back to the familiar tropes this series is known for, with fan favourite characters likely to make an appearance at some point.</p>
<p><iframe title="Resident Evil Requiem - 2nd Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tOYqFlgF6t8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Director Koshi Nakanishi gave insides on how the game is built around the concept of addictive fear –&nbsp;as in, the cathartic effect of overcoming fears. He also discussed how that ties in with the new protagonist, FBI agent Grace Ashcroft, who is shy and introverted, needing to overcome her fears and leaning on her training to be able to use a gun and fast deduction skills.</p>
<p>Leon had been in consideration to be the lead character for this new game, and would certainly have been popular, so why not return to the franchise staple?</p>
<p>“We always thought about making Leon the protagonist,” Nakanishi-san said. “But making a horror game based around him is difficult. He wouldn’t jump at something like a bucket falling. No one wants to see Leon scared by every little thing, so he’s actually quite a bad match for horror.”</p>
<p>All three Resident Evil games will launch on Nintendo Switch 2 on 27th February 2026.</p>

<p>Fortune of battle</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Closing out today's Nintendo Direct was a surprise announcement — we're getting a brand new Fire Emblem game on Switch 2 in 2026.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/fire-emblem-fortunes-weave">Fire Emblem: Fortune's Weave</a> looks absolutely incredible and appears to take place in an arid region with a huge colosseum seemingly a central feature.</p>
<p>Expect more tactical gameplay, some rather lovely character designs, and a few hints at some interconnected lore...</p>
<p>Here's what we know so far:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The Heroic Games have begun. The newest entry in the Fire Emblem series is set to enter the arena. The debut trailer provided a glimpse of the intertwining story, characters and turn-based tactical RPG gameplay that awaits players when the game launches for Nintendo Switch 2 in 2026."</p></blockquote><blockquote>

<p>Along with RE7 and RE: Village</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Following recent rumours, Capcom has confirmed that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/resident-evil-requiem">Resident Evil Requiem</a> will launch on the Switch 2 alongside the other platforms on <strong>27th February 2026</strong>.</p>
<p>This entry will follow Grace Ashcroft as she investigates mysterious deaths, including that of her mother, <strong>RE: Outbreak's</strong> Alyssa Ashcroft. The game will also feature the ruined remains of Raccoon City and the R.P.D station.</p>
<p>It's also been confirmed that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/resident-evil-7-biohazard">Resident Evil 7: Biohazard</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/resident-evil-village">Resident Evil: Village</a> (both Gold Editions) will be heading to the Switch 2 on the same date. Both titles originally launched on the Switch as Cloud Versions to much criticism, so hopefully these native versions will go toward restoring some faith from Nintendo fans.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p><strong>Update 12/09/2025:</strong> Prices for the regular and cardboard editions of the Virtual Boy are now live on Nintendo's official website, with the <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/virtual-boy-for-nintendo-switch-2-120829/">plastic version listed at $99.99 USD</a> and the <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/virtual-boy-cardboard-model-for-nintendo-switch-2-120828/">cardboard edition at $24.99</a>.</p>



<p><strong>Original Story:</strong></p>



<p>Nintendo is bringing back the Virtual Boy. No, really. Nintendo will once again sell the Virtual Boy, this time as an accessory for your Nintendo Switch and Nintendo Switch 2 device, to play Virtual Boy games through a <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-online-adds-game-boy-game-boy-advance/">Nintendo Switch Online Plus Expansion Pack</a> subscription. It'll be available on February 17, 2026.</p>



<p>The Virtual Boy accessory is required to play any of the Virtual Boy classic titles added to Nintendo Switch Online, as this is technically the latest 'classic console' Nintendo is adding to the subscription. Your Switch or Switch 2 slots into the Virtual Boy headset with the joycons removed, and with your face in the headset, you'll be able to play games like Mario's Tennis, Galactic Pinball, Teleroboxer, and more.</p>



<p>All 14 of the Virtual Boy titles released in North America will be making their way to the subscription service over time, though the three mentioned above were the only ones that showed some gameplay, so expect Mario's Tennis, Galactic Pinball, and Teleroboxer to be among the first games released for the new version of the Virtual Boy when it arrives in February 2026.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Virtual Boy – Nintendo Classics arrives February 17th (Nintendo Switch 2 / Nintendo Switch)" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0aXT9wzOLFg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>You'll have to be a Nintendo Switch Online subscriber to buy one in the first place, and while it's not clear yet how much it'll cost, there will be a classic cardboard version also available, that will hopefully be cheaper than the plastic version shown in the above trailer.</p>



<p>Whatever the cost, Nintendo has already proven it can <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-labo-vr-kit-announced/">make money by selling cardboard to its players</a>. And while it's great for people who were fans of the headset when it first launched and catastrophically bombed, it can't help but be a little comical, considering that this iteration of Nintendo's foray into VR will last longer than the original did, since it will almost certainly be on sale for longer than a calendar year.</p>

			<p>Resident Evil Requiem, the next entry in the survival-horror series by CAPCOM announced earlier this year, is coming to Nintendo Switch 2 as well as on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S.</p>



<p>A new trailer shown during today's Nintendo Direct provided a first look at the Switch 2 version of the game, which seems to look fine despite a noticeable visual downgrade over the other versions of the game and 30 FPS gameplay, and confirmed the game will hit the new generation Nintendo system on February 27, 2026, the same day it launches on the other systems. Additionally, as previously <a href="https://wccftech.com/ports-of-every-re-engine-game-coming-to-nintendo-switch-2/">rumored</a>, Resident Evil VII Biohazard and Resident Evil Village will also launch on the Nintendo Switch 2 on the same day.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Although we have yet to see any combat, Resident Evil Requiem is setting out to be one of the best entries in the series. During Gamescom last month, I had the chance to try out the game, and I was thoroughly impressed by the game's visuals and sound production, which create an amazing atmosphere that will only feel more eerie and scary when I finally will be able to experience the game under the proper conditions in a few months. You can learn more about what else the game seems to be doing really well in my<a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-requiem-gamescom-hands-on-preview-turn-on-the-lights/"> preview.</a></p>



<p>Resident Evil Requiem launches on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S, and Nintendo Switch 2 on February 27, 2026.</p>

            <p>Supergiant Games have finally done The Thing, following some patch teases that'd left things in a bit of an '<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/sike-hades-2-devs-supergiant-had-another-pre-full-release-patch-hiding-under-their-himation">either go or get off the pot' situation</a>. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hades-2">Hades 2</a>'s full release is nigh, with version 1.0 set to drop later this month.</p>
<p>I'm pleased, because the sequel to the horniest ancient Greek roguelike of all time was already very good in early access form. I'm also terrified, because it's not like September hasn't already had enough games to fight for my attention, between <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hollow-knight-silksong">Silksong</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/borderlands-4">Borderlands 4</a>.

<p>Anyway, Hades 2 version 1.0 arrives September 25th, as announced during today's Nintendo Direct. That showcase featured the launch trailer you can check out above, which teases the battle "beyond the underworld" which awaits Melinoë as she continues her war against Chronos, the insufferable time fellow.</p><p>Developers Supergiant have confirmed in a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1145350/view/512967793587520056?l=english">post on Steam</a> that this update'll be free so long as you already own the early access version of the game, while the current price will be staying the same if you're buying for the first time. 1.0 also brings "cross-saves between the Nintendo Switch and Nintendo Switch 2 versions and the version here on Steam", if you want to utterly betray your PC roots and build on your progress over on one of the Mario devices.</p>
<p>"Hades II is our team's first-ever sequel, and we've been giving it everything we've got for more than four and a half years," the devs added. "Since May of 2024, we've been developing in Early Access, taking feedback from our player community to try and fully realize this game's potential. The result is the biggest game we've ever made, and one we hope you'll find to be a worthy successor to its namesake."
</p>
<p>Our Brendy wrote the following about Hades 2 when he <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hades-2-early-access-review">reviewed its initial early access version</a> last year:</p>
<blockquote>Roguelikes, I feel, don't suffer as much as other genres from the early access path. The first Hades did it and it quickly became one of our best action games. So, I hereby grant you permission to crack through as much as this follow-up has got to offer, to get briefly obsessed, and then to put it aside for months. The piecemeal, adaptive storytelling is still there too, eschewing anything so simple as the classic three-act structure. Which, for me, makes long absences that much easier to bear. Like the game's own shrouded Narcissus, Hades 2 is already inviting and attractive, even in its unfinished form.</blockquote>
<p>Now, get out of the Melinoë, I've got to go remind myself how to do a Hades so my first version 1.0 run doesn't end in embarrassing fashion after about three rooms. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The rumors were true. Capcom’s blockbuster horror series is finding a new home on Switch 2. Not only will <a href="https://kotaku.com/re9-resident-evil-9-trailer-teaser-sgf-summer-game-fest-1851783941"><em>Resident Evil Requiem</em></a> be a day-one release on Nintendo’s portable console in February 2026, but <em>Resident Evil 7: Biohazard</em> and <em>Resident Evil Village</em> will be joining it as a collection on the same day.</p> <p>The Switch 2 trailer opened with <a href="https://kotaku.com/resident-evil-requiem-9-grace-trailer-gamescom-mother-2000618547">FBI agent Grace Ashcroft</a> investigating a series of murders in a spooky hotel amid one jumpscare after another. The footage appeared to be taken from a Switch 2 though the trailer didn’t immediately confirm that. If that’s the case, the ninth mainline <em>Resident Evil</em> isn’t looking too shabby on the weaker hardware.</p>  <p><em>Requiem</em> is out February 27, 2026 on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC as well. That’s also the day that some older <em>Resident Evil</em> games will finally make their way to Nintendo’s platform. Gold editions of Capcom’s <em>Resident Evil 7</em> and <em>Resident Evil Village</em>&nbsp;will both arrive then as well.</p>

 <p>These unexpected<em> Resident Evil</em> ports were rumored prior to today’s Nintendo Direct, with leakers suggesting the rest of the modern <em>Resident Evil</em> series, including remakes of <em>3</em> and <em>4</em> as well as <em>Resident Evil Village</em>, will arrive on Switch 2 eventually as well.</p> <p>While not confirmed, that fact that Capcom seems to be having so much success getting RE Engine games running on the new console is a good sign that we could see some of Capcom’s other blockbusters arrive on it, including maybe <em>Dragon’s Dogma 2</em> and <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em>. The latter is still in rough shape even on PC, though, so we’ll have to wait and see.</p>
