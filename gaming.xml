            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/silent-hill-f-officially-revealed-konami<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Konami and developer NeoBards Entertainment have officially revealed&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill f</em>, the newest entry in the long-running&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill&nbsp;</em>series of psychological horror games.</p>

<p>The game was first <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/silent-hill-2-remake-and-more-all-but-confirmed" rel="nofollow">revealed back in October 2022</a> as part of a&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill&nbsp;</em>Transmission showcase, but at the time, Konami didn't show much more than a short teaser trailer hinting at some of the game's concepts and story elements.</p>

<p>Now, Konami has fully unveiled the game, although we still don't know exactly how it will play since the debut trailer mostly seems to consist of narrative setup and cinematic cutscenes rather than actual moment-to-moment gameplay.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/silent-hill-f-revealed-hinako.jpg?itok=dEf64WpE 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/silent-hill-f-revealed-hinako.jpg?itok=5nv9pSg4 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Silent Hill f&nbsp;</em>has officially been revealed by Konami.</figcaption></figure><p>The game will focus on Hinako Shimizu, a young girl who lives in the remote Japanese town of Ebisugaoka. Of course, this being a horror game, Ebisugaoka is "consumed by a sudden fog", turning Hinako's home into a "haunting nightmare". Sounds like&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill&nbsp;</em>alright.</p>

<p>Konami says&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill f&nbsp;</em>will have you "solving complex puzzles and confronting grotesque monsters" as you navigate the foggy streets of Ebisugaoka. It also looks like the town will transition between its regular appearance and a classic&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill</em>-style haunted otherworld, which seems to have a strong floral motif this time around.</p>

<p>You can check out the debut trailer for&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill f&nbsp;</em>right here. It's more of a mood piece than an informative trailer; while you won't find much gameplay, you can see what kind of direction Konami and NeoBards are heading in with the game.</p>




<p><em>Silent Hill f&nbsp;</em>will boast writing by visual novel scribe Ryukishi07, who's best known for the&nbsp;<em>When They Cry&nbsp;</em>series. Music will, of course, be handled by longtime series composer Akira Yamaoka.</p>

<p>Elsewhere in&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill&nbsp;</em>news, Konami revealed back in January that the Bloober Team-developed&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill 2&nbsp;</em>remake has <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/silent-hill-2-remake-sales-2m" rel="nofollow">surpassed two million sales</a>. The two studios are currently <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bloober-team-konami-new-game-ip" rel="nofollow">working together on another project</a>, although we don't yet know if it's a&nbsp;<em>Silent Hill&nbsp;</em>game or not.</p>

<p><em>Silent Hill f&nbsp;</em>doesn't have a release date yet, but when it does launch, it'll be coming to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2947440/SILENT_HILL_f/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Final Fantasy XIV Patch 7.2 Release Date Revealed]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/final-fantasy-xiv-patch-72-release-date</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/final-fantasy-xiv-patch-7-2-release-date-revealed.1134672/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/final-fantasy-xiv-patch-72-release-date<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Square Enix has announced the release date for&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy XIV&nbsp;</em>Patch 7.2, which will bring more raids, a new dungeon, and more later this month.</p>

<p>Per the recent Letter from the Producer showcase,&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy XIV&nbsp;</em>Patch 7.2 officially launches on March 25th (which, coincidentally, puts it one day before the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/genshin-impact-version-5-5-release-date" rel="nofollow">release of&nbsp;<em>Genshin Impact&nbsp;</em>Version 5.5</a>, so it's going to be a busy couple of days if you play both).</p>

<p>As <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/final-fantasy-xiv-patch-7-2-march" rel="nofollow">previously revealed</a> by Square Enix,&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy XIV&nbsp;</em>Patch 7.2 will continue the post-<em>Dawntrail&nbsp;</em>narrative and pick up where <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/final-fantasy-xiv-patch-71-release-date" rel="nofollow">Patch 7.1 left off</a>, and it will also bring new raid encounters, as well as the new Occult Crescent activity, which is set to continue the legacy of&nbsp;<em>Shadowbringers</em>' Bozja or&nbsp;<em>Stormblood</em>'s Eureka.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/final-fantasy-xiv-patch-7.2-release-date-raids.jpg?itok=elf4Qwc6 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/final-fantasy-xiv-patch-7.2-release-date-raids.jpg?itok=BL-nOJpu 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Final Fantasy XIV</em>'s Patch 7.2 launches on March 26th.</figcaption></figure><p>As usual, the new story will bring with it a new dungeon, the Underkeep, for you and your friends (or randoms!) to explore, and you can also expect four more Arcadion raid encounters to test your mettle, as well as a trial to face during the main story.</p>

<p>The real star of the show this time around, however, is the Occult Crescent, a new Field Exploration activity that you can take on alongside many other&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy XIV&nbsp;</em>players. It won't be arriving until Patch 7.25, though.</p>

<p>Patch 7.2 will also bring with it a new Unreal-difficulty Hells' Kier trial, in which you'll be able to take on a significantly more powerful Suzaku. This one's going to take all your skill (probably).</p>

<p>The full patch notes for&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy XIV&nbsp;</em>Patch 7.2 have not yet been released, but you can likely expect them closer to the update's launch, so you'll need to wait a little bit to see whether they've nerfed Dark Knight. Knowing my luck, probably.</p>




<p><em>Final Fantasy XIV&nbsp;</em>Patch 7.2 launches on March 26th. The game, and its latest expansion&nbsp;<em>Dawntrail</em>, are available to play right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/agecheck/app/39210/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/final-fantasy-xiv-online/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/games/final-fantasy-xiv-online" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>.

            <p>"<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/ardenfall">Ardenfall</a> is almost cheeky in how close it is to a classic 'thesda game," Alice Bell wrote of the demo to this open-world <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> back in the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/is-this-indie-fantasy-rpg-the-morrowindlike-youve-been-looking-for">Aliceful year of 2023</a>. She also asked me about my own propensity for game discovery in my staff writer interview, to which I replied she knew I was OK at it because she nicked the idea for the Ardenfall article from a comment I left. Good taste, Alice, and good taste, me: Ardenfall is great fun. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1154960/Ardenfall/">It's had a demo kicking</a> around since 2022, and now it's set for an early access release this year. You'll find a steamin' hot tray-tray* below.</p>

<p>Ardenfall is notable for its lack of marauding 'go here next' fingers. Instead you'll navigate its world through NPC hints and the original signposting itself, signposts. There are factions, conversation stats, quest reactivity, all that good stuff. As for combat, here's reliable old mate Steam with the goods:</p>
<blockquote>"Choose your weapon. Now choose another. If you are stuck, there’s always more options to get you out of a bind - a throwing potion, a single use spell, or a throwing knife of fire may do the trick. A mage specialized in summoning may spawn a great beast to do their bidding, while a thief may toss a potion of silence on their targets to ensure a clean kill".</blockquote>
<p>It's from sixteen-strong Spellcast Studios. That number includes voice actors, and they've been working on the game for seven or so years now. I imagine a good chunk of that time was spent on making every NPC killable, charmable, or stealable-fromable. Time well spent, say I.</p>
<p>*The official RPS term for 'trailer'. Unless Edwin ends up editing this, in which case I have no idea how that got there. <em>["troll-troll", morelike - Ed]</em></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p dir="ltr">Square Enix has announced a crystal-shattering sales milestone for the Final Fantasy franchise. Worldwide, the RPG series has now topped 200 million copies sold, with the achievement apparently coinciding with the Final Fantasy Pixel Remaster series surpassing 5 million units sold.</p><p dir="ltr">The official Final Fantasy account <a href="https://x.com/FinalFantasy/status/1900396747647754617" rel="nofollow ">on X</a> shared the Ifrit-sized accomplishment for the series. The post also thanks players for "wherever you joined us on our adventures." The RPG franchise began in 1987 with the original Final Fantasy, with the most recent mainline addition being <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/final-fantasy-16-review-on-its-own-terms/1900-6418081/" data-ref-id="1900-6418081">Final Fantasy XVI</a> in 2023. Last year saw the launch of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-review-destinys-child/1900-6418187/">Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</a>, and the remake made its way to PC at the beginning of this year. In fact, the game starring Cloud Strife and crew <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-sets-a-new-record-for-the-longtime-series/1100-6529033/">set a Steam concurrent-players record for the series</a>.

It's an intriguing development after Square Enix noted that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/square-enix-says-final-fantasy-16-and-final-fantasy-7-rebirth-didnt-meet-sales-expectations/1100-6526552/" data-ref-id="1100-6526552">Final Fantasy VII Rebirth and Final Fantasy XVI failed to meet sales expectations</a> in September.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/FinalFantasy/status/1900396747647754617" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">The Final Fantasy Pixel Remaster series has sold over 5 million copies worldwide, and the Final Fantasy series has now sold over 200 million copies across the globe!<br>Wherever you joined us on our adventures, thank you. <a href="https://t.co/6eoIoDBXh0" rel="nofollow ">pic.twitter.com/6eoIoDBXh0</a></p>  — FINAL FANTASY (@FinalFantasy) <a href="https://twitter.com/FinalFantasy/status/1900396747647754617?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">March 14, 2025</a></blockquote>              </div><p dir="ltr">The Final Fantasy Pixel Remaster series--consisting of the first six mainline games in the franchise--originally launched on PC and mobile devices in 2021. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/final-fantasy-pixel-remaster-collection-is-coming-to-consoles-on-april-19/1100-6513014/">Square Enix then brought the Pixel Remaster series to Switch and PS4</a> in April 2023, with an Xbox Series X|S release happening in 2024.

<p>As revealed earlier today, you can expect&nbsp;<em>Genshin Impact&nbsp;</em>Version 5.5 to arrive on March 26th. It'll bring with it lots of new stuff, including the final tribe of Natlan in the Collective of Plenty, as well as two new characters, a new map, and more.</p>

<p>First up, you can explore the new Great Volcano of Tollan map, which promises plenty of secrets if you dare to delve into its magma-filled depths. As you travel to the mountain, you'll meet the Collective of Plenty and take part in their "friendly competitions" of strength.</p>

First up is 5-star Electro Catalyst wielder Varesa, who uses plunging attacks to deal extra damage and give her access to a special Elemental Burst ability.</p>

<p>Your second new fighter in&nbsp;<em>Genshin Impact&nbsp;</em>Version 5.5 is 4-star Electro Polearm wielder Iansan, who serves as a support character by buffing and healing her allies.</p>

<p>Varesa and Iansan will both debut in the first half of Version 5.5's cycle, with a rerun coming for <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/genshin-impact-introduces-new-five-star-anemo-character-xianyun" rel="nofollow">Xianyun</a> during that period as well. In the second half, reruns for Xilonen and Venti will be available.</p>

<p>Other activities include the return of the Bloomflower Trials, which will ask you to save an ill Saurian, as well as a new Treasure Seeker minigame that has you helping baby Saurians to "collect shiny treasures". D'awww.</p>

Finally, the mobile hit’s developers have promised a major overhaul of the busted system, though the fixes could still take a long time to roll out and will destroy a currency players already wasted a bunch of cards farming for. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196165" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="What’s Coming Out Beyond Pokémon: The Indigo Disk | The Week In Games" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="95" data-playlist="196165,196663,197298" data-current="196165"><div><p>What’s Coming Out Beyond Pokémon: The Indigo Disk | The Week In Games</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196165/196165_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196165/196165_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196165/196165_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196165/196165_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21711.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>“Thank you for sharing your feedback on the trading feature in Pokémon Trading Card Game Pocket,” the team announced <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://community.pokemon.com/en-us/discussion/17262/trading-feature-update&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://community.pokemon.com/en-us/discussion/17262/trading-feature-update" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">in a new blog post</a></span>. “We’re continuing to read your comments and investigate ways to improve the feature.” The biggest change is that trade tokens, a recently introduced currency required anytime you want to trade, will be removed and converted into Shinedust which will be required for trades instead. </p><p>Moments of economic upheaval like this have become common in free-to-play games, but some fans who already destroyed a bunch of their one-star cards to farm the currency for future trades now feel duped. “Appreciate the Trade Tokens being converted to Shinedust, but I definitely feel like an idiot for stocking up on Tokens now,” responded one player <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/PokemonTCGP/status/1900351172700959147&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/PokemonTCGP/status/1900351172700959147" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">on X</a></span>. “I shredded a bunch of rare cards. Oh well…” Another was similarly disappointed. </p><p>“Oh people melting their 1* cards to get trade token while sitting on 100k shine dust and they lost nothing?” explained another. Not everyone is sympathetic. “If you traded a card in you didn’t have spares of, that’s on you man, idk what to tell you,” wrote a player debating the subject on the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/PTCGP/comments/1jas52b/shinedust_is_the_new_trade_currency/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PTCGP/comments/1jas52b/shinedust_is_the_new_trade_currency/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>PTCG</em>P subreddit</a></span>. Players who have been hoarding shinedust since launch, on the other hand, are quite pleased with themselves right now. </p><p>A future update will also let players publicize cards they want to trade for, streamlining the current clumsy process of needing to coordinate trades offline or risk blindly offering up a card with no clue what someone might offer to trade in return. Sounds great! Unfortunately, the timeline for both changes is simply by the end of “autumn 2025.” Huh.</p><p>The <em>Pokémon TCG Pocket</em> is also looking at changing the current restriction on trading cards rarer than one-star, perhaps the thing players have complained about most regarding the game’s trade system. Instead of being able to trade with a friend for the hardest-to-get card, many hardcore fans are limited to trading for cards they already have. </p><p>“We are also looking into how to accommodate cards that are currently unavailable for trades, such as promo cards and two-star rarity cards,” the developers write. “Keep an eye out for more information about this topic in the future.” Given that trade tokens aren’t getting nuked for another six months as it is, I’m not holding out hope for two-star trading anytime soon. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/hecz-curse-optic-texas-cdl-woes/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/%E2%80%98we%E2%80%99re-cursed-man%E2%80%99-hecz-discusses-optic-texas-cdl-woes-following-0-15-record.1134615/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/hecz-curse-optic-texas-cdl-woes/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>In a new video uploaded by Hector ‘HECZ’ Rodriguez, the President at OpTic Texas (amongst other things), the current ‘curse’ plaguing the Call of Duty League team was discussed at length. The 18-minute video offered a walkthrough of the offices that OpTic Texas plays out of, with HECZ talking to his team about the issues that have led to a 0-15 map record in recent weeks.</p>



<p>It’s no big secret that <strong>something </strong>is wrong at OpTic Texas, as just a few months back, the team won the Call of Duty League Championship, the first COD world title for OpTic since 2017.</p>



<p>OpTic is trying anything at this point.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-i-think-it-s-this-room">‘I Think It’s This Room’</h2>



<p>OpTic Texas’ Dashy and Kenny both suggested in the video that the room they compete out of ‘might be cursed’, with HECZ revealing that he ‘saged’ the room, revealing at the end of the video exactly what that meant. He’d even taken the time to stencil the ‘Green Wall’ mantra on a whiteboard in the room to inspire his players.</p>



<p>Shotzzy took a similar path, suggesting that they need to relocate to the old office that used to house the squad in Dallas, Texas:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I know what it is, bro – I know what it is. We need to go back to the Dallas office.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Pred, who recently returned to the team <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/huke-replacing-pred-in-optic-texas-starting-roster/">after a hiatus</a> lasting a couple of months, agreed with Shotzzy.</p>



<p>Here’s the full video from HECZ:</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Enough is Enough" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-0uP630Tamw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>







<p>HECZ stuck tightly to the theory that this is a curse, suggesting that the organisation has to try ‘supernatural’ solutions to kick out the bad luck that surrounds the team.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Let’s talk about this curse. Let’s talk about this curse, because it can’t be anything else. It can’t be skill, they’ve proven to be world champions, they’ve proven to push through adversity – what made this happen?</p>
</blockquote>



<p>He also revisited comments he made previously, wherein he stated that the current roster is the worst Call of Duty team OpTic has ever had:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I know that I jokingly and not jokingly said that this is the worst team we’ve ever had, but it is becoming more and more clear that, as talented as these guys are, there’s something else.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>HECZ then walked around the office, demanding to know who had brought the curse upon the organisation. He then went off on a tanget about the talked-about ‘ring ceremony’ from COD Champs 2024, which is yet to take place. He stressed that ‘no matter how bad they’re doing’, the Green Wall and OpTic Texas <strong>deserve </strong>to see the ring ceremony.</p>



<p>What do you think is wrong at OpTic Texas? Let me know in the comments.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Ubisoft Seeking Investors For “New Entity”, Report Claims]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-seeking-investors-for-new-entity/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ubisoft-seeking-investors-for-%E2%80%9Cnew-entity%E2%80%9D-report-claims.1134612/</guid>

<p>Ubisoft is actively looking to bring more investors into the fold for what is described as a “new entity”. This, according to a new report from Bloomberg.</p>



<p>In the <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-14/assassin-s-creed-creator-ubisoft-is-said-to-seek-gaming-backers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">report published</a> on Friday, Bloomberg says that the company is “considering selling a minority stake in the venture and has contacted potential bidders.” These bidders include Tencent along with various funds located both in France and around the globe.</p>



<p>“Ubisoft has asked for preliminary bids to be made as soon as this month, the people added, asking not to be identified discussing a private matter,” Bloomberg says.</p>



<p>This new venture would include “some of its core” gaming franchises such as Assassin’s Creed. Tencent refused to comment on the claims while Ubisoft pointed to recent earnings reports where it stated that it was exploring all possible options for the company.</p>



<p>The idea of a “new entity” isn’t completely new. Back in January, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tencent-and-guillemot-family-considering-new-venture-with-ubisoft-assets/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">it was reported</a> that Ubisoft and Tencent had talks of a “new venture” that would allow the Guillemot family to retain control of the company while giving Tencent more control over various assets. At the time, Insider Gaming sources said that there was no firm decision or direction reached with the company continuing to look at every option.</p>



<p>Recently, Ubisoft has continued to come under fire both outside and within the company. A minority shareholder has even called for a protest outside the company’s Paris headquarters after its claim that the studio <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-shareholder-claims-company-failed-to-disclose-meetings-with-ea-and-microsoft-about-ip-acquisition/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">failed to disclose IP acquisition talks</a> with EA and Microsoft.</p>



<p>What do you think of Ubisoft looking for investors to create a new company entity in order to turn things around? Let us know down below, and join the discussion in the official <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums</a>.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/commandos-origins-refreshingly-brings-back-the-stealth-tactics-marriage.1134600/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/commandos-origins-refreshingly-brings-back-the-stealth-tactics-marriage<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">The classic Commandos series was all about cleverly commanding a squad to pull off some daring operations aimed at crippling the Nazi war machine and putting a real stick in the eye of the empire. But it's also a series that's been in relative dormancy for some time, leaving other games like Shadow Tactics and Desperados to pick up the torch and offer a similar blend of real-time strategy and stealth gameplay that's all about pulling off some slick, decisive strategies.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">With the upcoming Commandos: Origins from developer Claymore Game Studios, the series finally gets its long overdue successor following the 2006 FPS spin-off, marking a return to the original's old-school perspective and brutal difficulty. I recently got to play the opening missions of Commandos: Origins and came away appreciating this revival of an open-ended tactical stealth-action game – even if it took me some time to come to grips with it.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">As a return to the classic gameplay and storytelling of the early PC games in the series, Commandos: Origins appropriately focuses on the founding of the elite squad. As green beret Jack O'Hara, he's recruited by commando Sergeant Hancock with a mission to strike back against the growing Nazi empire. Following a daring escape through a North African allied base overrun by the Axis army, the duo soon expands their crew to engage in a larger campaign to destroy key targets across Europe and even the Arctic regions.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Origins taps into the style of pulpy, ensemble action films in the vein of The Guns of Navarone or The Dirty Dozen for its campaign. </p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Commandos: Origins works has both a modern update to the classic formula of the series, but also as a jumping on point for those who've never played the originals. Much like the previous games, Origins taps into the style of pulpy, ensemble action films in the vein of The Guns of Navarone or The Dirty Dozen for its campaign. The core gameplay is a blend of real-time strategy and a carefully paced tactics game, where you command a small squad to sneak through bases, take out targets, and make it out alive. Instead of moving turns like other tactics games, your squad and all enemies on the field will move and react in real-time, which pushes you to make your moves count – or else face the onslaught of enemies on the field.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking to art director Thilo Gebhardt from Claymore Game Studios, he explained how the developer was specifically founded to help revive the Commandos series and how they approached modernizing it for Origins.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"The original owner of Kalypso Media, Simon Hellwig, who passed away, had the idea to bring back Commandos – he was a big fan of the original games," Gebhardt said. "He had the opportunity to acquire it, and once he decided to make the next game an in-house production, he founded Claymore Studios specifically to revisit the brand. [...] With other competitors in the genre recently they've shown that this type of game can still be updated to a more modern standard because it can be a hardcore experience. But we've also found ways to improve the interface and the pacing, and we hope to have made that experience more modern and less frustrating for new players."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">With each mission giving you a list of objectives and a large map to explore, you're tasked with completing them efficiently and carefully. By taking advantage of blindspots in enemy line of sight and patrol patterns and using gadgets from the key members of each squad, you're given plenty of opportunities and a wide berth in how you clear a mission. In some ways, it felt like each stage was a puzzle box to solve – by way of a stealth-action tactics game, and I soon had to get comfortable with hiding guards after I had taken them out of commission.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The opening mission in North Africa served as a solid tutorial in showcasing just how versatile but still specialized the squad members were. For instance, Sergeant Hancock takes on the role of the combat sapper, a combat engineer who can cut through wire barricades and plant powerful explosives to blow up targets. I found a lot to appreciate with how each squad member can coordinate, particularly with pulling off O'Hara's advanced traversal skills and quick stealth attacks to help clear the way for his allies to break the objectives.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The stealth mechanics are impressive and really show a level of depth with the enemy AI and level design – particularly with how guards will remember which allies are in the area and how snowprints are visible in places that shouldn't be. While I mostly crawled through the stages to be on the safe side, I still appreciated the moments when I could get a solid jump on the enemy. One useful option is the command mode, which lets you plan out specific moves for multiple squad members to execute all at once. Following the opening mission, Commandos immediately put me to the test in the following mission, which chucked me into the deep end.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Simply put, the difficulty here is super challenging. If just one commando dies, it's a loss. I ended up failing – a lot – and that meant reloading saves to try again. Much like early entries, Commandos: Origins sticks with a retro style of progression in each mission – and that means you'll need to embrace the retro concept of manually saving often – as auto-saves are not present in missions. In one instance during the second operation, I reached an important section of the stage but was quickly gunned down by patrolling troops. Because I was so focused on maneuvering my crew, I had forgotten to save and lost close to 10 minutes of progress.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">According to the developers, the classic approach to manual saving was intentional, as it sticks close to the experience of the original games and doesn't seek to give players too many safety nets.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We thought a lot about the fans of the original games, and for them, the aspect of how saving works was something you simply shouldn't change, it really comes down to taking away the liberty to decide on your own how you want to save your progress and what risk you want to take," the art director Gebhardt said. "Personally, I will save a lot, and there are some more daring and more experienced players who deliberately do not save. And they approach it like a little bit of a puzzle with a more creative way. So really for Commandos, it's about creative freedom of selecting your own safe points for."</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>These repeated mission attempts, in some cases, turned out to be a blessing...</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">My losses regularly felt crushing, especially considering just how lengthy missions can be. I often felt the need to take a break, but I still rallied and came through. These repeats, in some cases, turned out to be a blessing, as they allowed me to go through the trial-and-error process and pick up new strategies, sometimes allowing me to satisfyingly make the best of a clumsy situation.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In one mission, I had to destroy a guarded comms tower. I originally took out all guards in the area and then destroyed the tower, but upon a redo of the area, I simply destroyed the tower and watched it crash down on two guards, with me walking away feeling like I was Agent 47 in Hitman. In one satisfying instance, I used my sniper commando to pull off a Saving Private Ryan-style series of quick sniper shots on alerted guards, giving my team some breathing room to rally.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The raw satisfaction that comes from tactics games is seeing a plan come together after taking a risk, and Commandos: Origins certainly offered up plenty of those moments – even after my crushing defeats. So far, Claymore Game Studios' revival of Commandos is offering a compelling case for its comeback, which can potentially put the series back on the map as an exciting and satisfying tactics game.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-will-have-slower-adoption-game-pass-to-reach-50-million-subs-in-2025-says-superdata-founder/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 will be fully unveiled soon, with the special Direct show scheduled for April 2 and subsequent public hands-on events taking place all over the world. The rumor is that it might launch <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-june-release-announced-direct/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">as soon as this June</a>, which seems all the more likely after the <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-400000-units-shipped-north-america/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">news</a> that nearly 400K units were shipped to North America in the month of January alone.</p>
<p>Just how much of a success is the Nintendo Switch 2 going to be, though? Analysts aren't quite of the same mind in this regard. In a <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-13/nintendo-switch-2-set-for-gaming-s-biggest-ever-launch-even-at-400-plus?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc0MTkwNjI1OCwiZXhwIjoxNzQyNTExMDU4LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJTU1ZXUTRUMVVNMFcwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJBRDcxOUY5NDBGRTk0MzNBOERCNzI2OEJDOTY3NzY3QyJ9.CFhPdHSiBuDEkV7N-hnAkpNngwdsityYMc9VRAYSIZU&amp;leadSource=uverify%20wall" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bloomberg article</a> published yesterday, Serkan Toto shared his bullish outlook:</p>
<p><em>They will sell boatloads of Nintendo Switch 2 in the first months in particular, almost regardless of the price. We can expect a great software lineup in year one, from new Mario Kart and 3D Mario after eight years to Pokémon Legends: Z-A and Metroid Prime 4. There will also be third-party support from day one, most probably including blockbusters like Call of Duty.</em></p>
<p>However, SuperData Research co-founder Joost van Dreunen has a different opinion on the subject. Van Dreunen, who sold SuperData Research to Nielsen in 2018 and is now the CEO of data intelligence firm <a href="https://www.aldora.io/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Aldora</a> (while also teaching at the NYU Stern School of Business), wrote in the freshly <a href="https://www.beautiful.ai/player/-OL44iya9VPmIeTHhtHw/ALDORAs-SXSW-2025-State-of-Play-Report" target="_blank" rel="noopener">published </a>'The 2025 State of Play on Games, Tech, and Media' report:</p>
<p><em>No. The backward compatibility of the Nintendo Switch 2, combined with its relatively modest technical improvements, ensures a slower adoption curve, especially among cost-conscious consumers during the start of its new hardware cycle. It is expected to cost around $399 at launch.</em></p>
<p>In the report, van Dreunen shared a few more interesting opinions on the hottest games industry topics. As mentioned in this article's headline, the analyst believes Game Pass will reach 50 million subscribers this year as consumers become more careful with their spending on video games and look for cheaper alternatives like that offered by Microsoft. He also reckons an ad-based tier will be added soon.</p>
<p>Speaking about the rising game costs, van Dreunen doesn't think Rockstar and Take-Two will bump up the price of Grand Theft Auto VI to $100 as some have feared. However, he adds that there will be a myriad of incentives for the more expensive editions, which will cost up to $150-200. Additionally, van Dreunen expects GTA VI to&nbsp;generate a billion dollars in sales on launch day.</p>
<p>His last two predictions are less positive. The veteran analyst thinks that Ubisoft is about to be bought by private equity, which will trigger another wave of layoffs across the publisher's many studios. The industry as a whole will suffer more layoffs, especially among the bigger studios, as they keep cutting in-development titles that aren't projected to do well upon release.</p>

                <p>A new report sheds some light on the situation surrounding the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-release-date-specs-display-price/1100-6520278/" data-ref-id="1100-6520278">Switch 2</a>'s upcoming launch, which is poised to be one of 2025's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-and-switch-2-will-help-video-game-industry-rebound-in-2025-analyst-predicts/1100-6526016/" data-ref-id="1100-6526016">biggest events in the gaming industry (alongside the debut of GTA 6).</a></p><p>Analyst Serkan Toto told <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-13/nintendo-switch-2-set-for-gaming-s-biggest-ever-launch-even-at-400-plus?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc0MTkwNjI1OCwiZXhwIjoxNzQyNTExMDU4LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJTU1ZXUTRUMVVNMFcwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJBRDcxOUY5NDBGRTk0MzNBOERCNzI2OEJDOTY3NzY3QyJ9.CFhPdHSiBuDEkV7N-hnAkpNngwdsityYMc9VRAYSIZU" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Bloomberg</a> that Nintendo will sell "boatloads" of the Switch 2 in the first few months after launch, "almost regardless of price." Toto also elaborated on what he believes will be some of the Switch 2 games coming in the first year, guessing that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/mario-kart-9/" data-ref-id="5000-658545">Mario Kart 9</a>, a new 3D Mario game, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/metroid-prime-4-beyond/" data-ref-id="5000-465595">Metroid Prime: Beyond</a>, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pokemon-legends-z-a-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6521882/" data-ref-id="1100-6521882">Pokemon Legends Z-A</a> will come to the system within the first 12 months.</p><p>He also predicted there will "probably" be a Call of Duty game released on Switch 2 in the first year, among other third-party support.</p><p>Regarding the price of the Switch 2, Toto joined other quoted analysts like Yijia Zhai of UBS and Robin Zhu of Sanford C. Bernstein in predicting the Switch 2 will be at least $100 more expensive than the original Switch was at launch ($300). Zhu said the Switch 2 may launch in June, with Nintendo preparing between 6 million and 8 million units for day-one inventory.</p><p>Regarding the potential higher price point relative to the OG Switch, Toyo Securities analyst Hideki Yasuda said the Switch 2's new chipset from Nvidia will cost as much as $150, which compares to $80 per unit for the original Switch. Given that, Yasuda said, "I wouldn't be surprised if Nintendo goes ahead with $499."</p><p>There is also the matter of how <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-tariffs-may-lead-publishers-to-abandon-physical-games-says-analyst/1100-6529858/" data-ref-id="1100-6529858">possible US tariffs</a> could impact pricing for the Switch 2. It remains to be seen how it'll all shake out. Bloomberg reported that Nintendo has already shifted some of its hardware production efforts to Vietnam, a country with no new tariffs right now. Nintendo will also produce Switch 2 units in China, where tariffs may be in effect when the Switch 2 launches. Units produced in China could be allocated for other regions outside of the US, but nothing is known or confirmed as of yet.</p><p>As for how well the Switch 2 could sell in its first year, analyst Hiroshi Yamashina of Macquarie Capital said the system could shift more than 20 million units. By comparison, the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/analysts-say-nintendo-switch-2-wont-outsell-the-original-switch-but-thats-okay" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">original Switch sold 13.12 million units during its first calendar year.</a></p><p>As for when Nintendo will officially share more information on the Switch 2, that's going to happen on April 2 during a special <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-revealed-launch-date/1100-6528762/" data-ref-id="1100-6528762">Switch 2 Nintendo Direct.</a></p>

			<p>The next entry in the Call of Duty series launching later this year could feature up to a total of six fully-fledged zombies maps throughout its lifecycle, according to rumors circulating online.</p>
<p>A new report shared today by <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-2025-zombies-maps-details/">Insider Gaming</a> revealed that developer Treyarch's plan for zombies was to create maps from the ground up to allow them to be used in different play modes, like traditional round-based modes, grief, and outbreak. As for the settings, Treyarch has been experimenting with some extreme scenarios, including a post-World War II New York map devastated by a nuclear attack, a map set in a Japanese temple located at the foot of a volcano, a space station map, and others. It is unclear if all of these maps will make the cut, but according to today's report, some of them are expected to be released for the final game.</p>
<p>The next entry in the Call of Duty series has yet to be officially revealed, but leaks have already revealed that the game codenamed Saturn will be a semi-futuristic sequel to Black Ops 2, which will also feature remastered maps from the classic entry in the series. The game's development is reportedly being led by Treyarch Games, which released the solid Black Ops 6 last year on PC and consoles.

			<p>Despite the deluge of other shopkeep simulators and crafting games, the Atelier series has something like a comforting warm blanket. It’s a long-running RPG series that tends to focus more on the day-to-day life of being an alchemist and creating goods for the common folk. While the series has shied away from the mundane as the series has gone on, the spirit of creativity and crafting remains at its core. After a three-game run with Ryza Stout, Gust has finally introduced the latest entry in the series with <a href="https://wccftech.com/atelier-yumia-ps5-preview-alchemy-finally-comes-to-xbox/">Atelier Yumia: The Alchemist of Memories &amp; the Envisioned Land</a>.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Atelier-Yumia-Memories.png"></a></figure>

<p>As is the case with most of the subseries of Atelier, players don’t necessarily need to play any of the previous titles to fully comprehend the setting or core gameplay mechanics. That’s in part due to most Atelier trilogies mixing up the combat and crafting mechanics from one series to the next, and Atelier Yumia is no exception. The tough constraints of taking time to craft against an ever-dwindling calendar are long gone, and so much of Atelier’s focus this time around is on the adventure outside of the atelier rather than the mysteries within.</p>
<p>Atelier Yumia: The Alchemist of Memories &amp; the Envisioned Land centers around the titular Yumia Liessfeldt, an already somewhat established alchemist who’s been dabbling in the taboo arts that once sought the great kingdom of Aladiss ruin. In her role as the junior member of an exploratory group put together to explore abandoned ruins and learn the mysteries of what happened, she’s often stigmatized for her craft. There’s good reason for many of these expeditionary forces to be wary of her, as alchemy had led to a number of great catastrophes in their lifetime. Nevertheless, Yumia’s goal in all of this is to uncover the mysteries of just what happened to make alchemy such a feared topic and track down her missing mother in the process.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Atelier-Yumia-Journal.png"></a></figure>

<p>The open world of Atelier Yumia is filled with so many little landmarks and items to gather that you can barely walk ten feet without bumping into another point of interest. In my OCD nature, I found myself aiming to reach 100% of each of the continent’s four regions for both achievements and a sense of completion. From locked treasure chests to small shrines of power that need basic logic puzzles completed before they confer their skill points to Yumia, there are often times too many little side diversions that keep the player from following along with Atelier Yumia’s storyline. In many ways, Gust shows its influence from the likes of Genshin Impact and tries to capture some of that Chinese title’s energy and design. When there’s no time limit to finish the story and bag space large enough to fit the materials of an entire house in your bag, there’s little reason not to just wander the open plains of Aladiss, beat up a Puni or two, and just spend the afternoon ticking off completion checkmarks for every little node that pops up on the map.</p>
<p>Something I didn’t realize until my thirtieth hour of playing Atelier Yumia is that the expeditionary force has a small checklist of activities they would like Yumia to take care of for them in each region as part of their Pioneering Effort. These range from using a specific item or character skill in combat to crafting specific pieces of furniture and the like. Initially, I thought these were just another way to gain experience and skill points, but I finally realized that completing this evergrowing checklist in each region, at least in the case of the first two, unlocks special ammo for Yumia’s gunstaff that can be used to break some of the barriers in her path. If you come across marbled walls that seem brittle to the touch or a spider’s web blocking access to a treasure chest, that’s how Yumia comes across these different ammo types.</p>
<p>One thing that I wish I had known sooner was that she has to return to the leader of the expeditionary force each time she crosses the 10% threshold on the completion list to cash in her current progress, earn a small reward, and unlock the next tier of objectives. Only by completing this list to 100% in a given region does Yumia unlock the special ammo or other tool to aid in her adventure. There isn’t a quest marker or anything obvious to guide the player, so it’s worth checking up on the expedition team once in a while if you feel like you’ve done enough to further the cause.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Atelier-Yumia-Greenhouse-1.png"></a></figure>

<p>Combat in the Atelier series has typically been a turn-based affair, or at least something more methodical. Atelier Yumia mixes up the formula by instead turning the entire focus of combat into an action affair. Yumia and her two party members can all act independently (with some AI strategies for the characters not actively being controlled) and attack the enemy all at once. Rather than being able to freely run around the battlefield, Yumia fights the enemy by circling around them in two set planes where she can fight from either short or long range with a single button press jumping between the two distances. Players can strafe around the enemy or block attacks, with perfectly timed defensive moves giving a powerful counterattack.</p>
<p>Yumia and her crew don’t have your standard attack and separate skill commands, but rather, all four of their attack commands are skills unique to that character and differ depending on if they’re approaching the enemy from short or long range. Each skill has a set number of uses before it needs to recharge over time, so players have to manage whether they want to burst all of their damage at once or play conservatively and keep a couple of skills on reserve for a precision counterattack. The items Yumia crafts operate in a similar fashion and are just a quick button press away to swap from skills to items. Yumia can carry four different attack items into combat, and much like other Atelier games, understanding the crafting system to make overpowered weapons is, while not required, sometimes the most enjoyable way to play as it makes combat little more than a formality. By the time I was set to venture off between the second and third biomes of Aladiss, I already had a wind boomerang and massive ice hammer that could hit for somewhere in the region of 5,000-12,000 damage, depending on the enemy’s weakness.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Atelier-Yumia-Nice-Levelup.png"></a></figure>

<p>Another strange oddity to Atelier Yumia’s combat that helped turn the combat into a breeze was the actual EXP rate. It wasn’t uncommon for me to go two, maybe three fights at a time between leveling up. My concerns of only having two or so combat skills available from my preview of Atelier Yumia last month were quickly resolved as I was already close to level 40 before even setting foot in the Atelier for the first time. It’s hard to say whether this was an intentional growth rate or merely the unintended side effect of testing out the various difficulty levels and the one EXP-boosting accessory I could craft early on. Regardless, I hit the level cap of 100 midway through the second biome of Aladiss and only had to worry about crafting stronger armor and combat items for the growth of my party. Grinding never felt like it was necessary with how quickly I was leveling up, although I did see myself hunting down a few specific enemy types over and over to gather up their raw materials for crafting.</p>
<p>The actual art of crafting items in your atelier is something that sets this alchemy RPG series apart from one another, even in terms of individual trilogies. Where Yumia draws her inspiration from are memories of items, remembering the base materials they’re made from and combining those raw goods with an elemental alchemy core to recreate the image in her mind rather than throwing it all together in a massive melting pot as is series tradition. This allows Yumia to craft simpler things on the go, from bandages and repair kits to the various ammo types for her gunstaff. More complex items, i.e., anything usable in battle, do require the use of an atelier or at least a mobile crafting station she can put down in any of the buildable campsites around Aladiss. There’s a strange minigame to crafting, where Yumia has to install the raw materials into her alchemy core and use the resonance area that each material has to capture stray mana particles and make the particular item stronger based on a number of arbitrary factors per recipe. If all of this sounds too complex, players can just push the touchpad when beginning a recipe and pick whether they want a high-quality item with stronger innate effects or the bare minimum made with the cheapest materials possible.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Atelier-Yumia-Combat.png"></a></figure>

<p>Building campsites and rest stations across Aladiss in also a simple automatically guided affair if you want it to be. Sure, you can build yourself the crafting stations and meticulously craft your ideal atelier on the go and build everything from the walls to the individual chairs yourself, or there are prefab recipe guides where you can just throw your extra wood and metal resources in at once and come out with a perfectly functional two-story abode. It’s a nice touch for those who like to fully immerse themselves in the RPG and show off their own style, but in a single-player JRPG with no way to share your creations outside of posting screenshots on social media, may be a bit much for the average gamer.</p>

<p>Calling Atelier Yumia: The Alchemist of Memories &amp; the Envisioned Land a guided JRPG experience is probably the best way to recommend this title to others. Everything bar the combat has been streamlined and simplified to make this entry the most approachable one to date for newcomers. Series veterans might not find much of a challenge to this mystery, but Gust has put together a solid first experience to bring the long-running alchemy RPG series to Xbox.</p>

            <p>Fans of damp tunnels and chatty skeletons may have enjoyed <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/lunacid">Lunacid</a>, a first-person dungeon crawler which left early access in October 2023. Sin <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/lunacid-is-lo-fi-first-person-dungeon-skulking-done-right">called it</a> “lo-fi first-person dungeon skulking done right” and suggested that it “could well earn a place in some best of the year lists”. (It didn’t appear on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/our-24-favourite-games-of-2023">ours</a>, but in fairness, that was the year <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/baldurs-gate-3-class-list">Baldur's Gate 3</a> devoured everybody’s brain.) </p>
<p>Lunacid takes copious inspiration from <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dark-souls">Dark Souls</a> developer FromSoftware’s old Shadow Tower and King’s Field games for PS1. Now, creators KIRA LLC are going even further with Lunacid: Tears Of The Moon - a new RPG made using FromSoftware’s ancient Sword Of Moonlight: King’s Field game creation tools from 2000, which came with hundreds of map parts, objects and characters plus scripting features and the ability to insert AVI movies and even a credits reel.</p><!--more-->
<p><a href="https://en.swordofmoonlight.org/wiki/Sword_of_Moonlight">Officially released only in Japan</a>, Sword Of Moonlight granted buyers unlimited use of the King's Field intellectual property, including the right to release and sell their own games. While hardly the Unity Engine of its day, it fostered a quietly thriving fangame scene with projects such as <a href="https://kings-field.neocities.org/som/dom/info">Diadem Of Maunstraut</a> finding an audience overseas.</p>
<p>Even if you don’t jive with elderly fangames, Lunacid - Tears of the Moon has charm. Like many a FromSoftwork, it takes place in a fallen kingdom and sees you journeying underground to soothe/defeat a restless cosmic being. Not being familiar with Sword Of Moonlight, I can’t say how much it tests the capabilities of FromSoftware’s 25-year-old toolset, but I enjoy the lurid smog of the dungeons and the lumbering choreography of the first-person combat.</p>
<p>Tears Of The Moon will release on 12th April 2025 - here's the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3506110/Lunacid__Tears_of_the_Moon/">Steam page</a>. While reading up on Sword Of Moonlight, I also stumbled on <a href="https://swordofmoonlight.itch.io/k">this King’s Field 2 preservation project</a>, which makes use of the same tools. It seems like a noble enterprise, though sadly the creator has run into difficulties following a schizophrenia diagnosis. If you’re checking out Tears Of The Moon, maybe show this some love, too.</p>

      </p></div><div><p>The version 5.5 update for <em><a title="Games > Genshin Impact [122 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/genshin-impact">Genshin Impact</a></em>, dubbed “Day of the Flame’s Return,” will launch on March 26, developer <a title="Companies > miHoYo [187 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/mihoyo">miHoYo</a> announced. <span id="more-950103"></span></p><p>Here is an overview of the update, via miHoYo:</p><blockquote><p>Venturing into the southwestern reaches of Natlan, players will meet a new tribe, the Collective of Plenty, and explore the Great Volcano of Tollan, where they may begin their journey towards the sacred city. Meanwhile, Varesa, a new ally, and the long-awaited Iansan will become playable alongside a new Saurian companion, the Tatankasaurus, all to collectively enrich combat and exploration!</p><p>Long revered as a sacred mountain, the Great Volcano of Tollan now extends its fiery embrace to all players who dare to tread its depths— where traces of its rich, layered history lie hidden, where a sacred city built by the Dragonborn slumbers, slowly roused by the restless roiling of magma beneath. Players can enter the Sacred City of Tollan through a special method, and set out to unravel the mystery of the “Flamelord’s Blessing” and the enigma surrounding their Little One.</p><p>On the path to the sacred mountain, players will encounter a new tribe, the Collective of Plenty. The people there are deeply devoted to fitness and love to test their strength in friendly competitions. Nurtured by fertile volcanic soil, the tribe’s harvest is blessed with exceptionally sweet and juicy fruits. However, the volcano, though usually simmering in silence, can occasionally spring to life and spew out showers of falling rocks. When this happens, players can transform into the Tatankasaurus, a new Saurian from the Collective of Plenty, capable of smashing through large chunks of Pulverite and even briefly dashing across water or liquid Phlogiston.</p><p>New Saurians roam this scorching land, as do the Collective of Plenty’s noble warriors. Among them are Varesa and Iansan, who can sprint and perform flying leaps as they traverse Natlan’s terrain.</p></blockquote><!-- AD: content -->
        <div id="carousel_950104"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><blockquote><p>Varesa is a 5-star Electro Catalyst user who uses Plunging Attacks to trigger her Fiery Passion state. While in this state, she deals more Electro DMG, and can access a special Elemental Burst with reduced Energy cost. To quickly enter this state, Varesa can tap her Elemental Skill, then follow up with Normal Attacks to perform swift Plunging Attacks. Additionally, her unique talent helps restore Phlogiston after the party consumes food. As her Tribal Chronicle will reveal, Varesa is only fierce in battle, and leads a daily life almost far too laid-back.</p><p>Known as Varesa’s coach and one of the six heroes of Natlan, Iansan is a 4-star Electro Polearm wielder. She provides powerful support to the party by enhancing the on-field character’s ATK while also healing her allies. Her Elemental Burst increases the on-field character’s ATK even when she is off-field, and her ATK buff scales with the distance that her teammates move. Additionally, when her teammates trigger a Nightsoul Burst, Iansan obtains the Warming Up effect, allowing her to continuously restore HP to the on-field character for a short duration. In the first phase of Version 5.5’s Event Wishes, Varesa and Iansan will debut alongside Xianyun’s rerun, followed by reruns for Xilonen and Venti.</p><p>After a long hiatus, Natlan’s traditional Bloomflower Trials will be making a return. Players will team up with Mavuika, Ifa, and their other Natlan allies to participate in this unique event, and save a brave Saurian afflicted by a rare illness. Moreover, in the “Saurian Treasure Seeker” mini-game, players can also assist a group of baby Saurians in their quest to overcome obstacles and collect shiny treasures. By taking part in the event, players will have the opportunity to invite Ororon for free.</p><p>Version 5.5 also introduces new challenges and system optimizations. A new boss, the Lava Dragon Statue, awaits in the geothermal fissures of the volcano. As for optimizations, the Artifact leveling experience will be enhanced, as upgrading Artifacts defined with Sanctifying Elixirs guarantees at least two upgrades to the defined Minor Affixes.</p></blockquote><p><em>Genshin Impact</em> is available now for <a title="Platforms > PS5 [9,048 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps5">PlayStation 5</a>, <a title="Platforms > Xbox Series [6,878 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/xbox/xbox-series">Xbox Series</a>, <a title="Platforms > PS4 [27,805 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps4">PlayStation 4</a>, <a title="Platforms > PC [22,599 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> via <a href="https://ys-api-os.mihoyo.com/event/download_porter/link/ys_global/genshinimpactpc/default" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">client</a> and <a href="https://www.epicgames.com/store/p/genshin-impact" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Epic Games Store</a>, iOS via the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/genshin-impact/id1517783697" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">App Store</a>, and Android via <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.miHoYo.GenshinImpact" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Google Play</a>.

The player takes on the role of an adventurer tasked with saving a town plagued by a curse, while exploring dungeons filled with hidden treasures. However, within the dungeons, curses can suddenly befall the player due to enemy attacks, treasure chest traps, or certain locations. Curses are not just a disadvantage—if brought back to town and purified, they can be used to strengthen the player. Players will need to decide how long they can endure the curse as they press forward.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>The gameplay system follows the traditional command battle RPG format, with turn-based battles that split the party into a vanguard and rearguard. The player’s party will consist of a variety of classes, with the following five revealed so far: Fighter, Barbarian, Archer, Paladin, and Sorcerer. Additional classes are expected to be revealed in the future.</p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/NIS-New-Titles_03-14-25_Curse_002.jpg"></a></figure><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/NIS-New-Titles_03-14-25_Curse_003.jpg"></a></figure><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/NIS-New-Titles_03-14-25_Curse_004.jpg"></a></figure><p><strong>■ Project Name: <em>Gobble</em></strong></p><ul><li><strong>Platforms:</strong> PlayStation 5, Switch</li><li><strong>Release Date:</strong> 2025</li><li><strong>Genre:</strong> <a title="Genres > Side-Scrolling [931 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/side-scrolling">Side-Scrolling</a> Action</li></ul><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/NIS-New-Titles_03-14-25_Gobble_001.jpg"></a></figure><p><em>Gobble</em> is a side-scrolling action game that originated from Nippon Ichi Software’s annual internal competition, the “Nippon Ichi Project Festival.” The game was conceived by an employee in their second year at Nippon Ichi Software, who is now serving as the project’s development manager. Past contests have resulted in the creation of titles like <em>htoL#NiQ: The Firefly Diary</em>, <em>Yomawari: Night Alone</em>, and <em>The Liar Princess and the Blind Prince</em>.</p><p>The game is set in a world that should have found peace after the defeat of the Demon King. The protagonist, a young boy, encounters a talking “sickle” during a sudden monster attack. The brash sickle and the boy, who is searching for his missing family, form a duo, and a quirky, dark adventure begins.</p><p>The key mechanic in the game is “predation.” By consuming defeated enemies, the sickle can steal their abilities.</p><p>The game stands out with its distinctive use of American comic-style events and cartoon-like animations. Players should also pay attention to the visuals featured throughout the game, during moments like attacking or defeating enemies, or when events occur.</p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/NIS-New-Titles_03-14-25_Gobble_002.jpg"></a></figure><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/NIS-New-Titles_03-14-25_Gobble_003.jpg"></a></figure><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/NIS-New-Titles_03-14-25_Gobble_004.jpg"></a></figure><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/NIS-New-Titles_03-14-25_Gobble_005.jpg"></a></figure><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/NIS-New-Titles_03-14-25_Gobble_006.jpg"></a></figure><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/NIS-New-Titles_03-14-25_Gobble_007.jpg"></a></figure><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/NIS-New-Titles_03-14-25_Gobble_008.jpg"></a></figure><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/NIS-New-Titles_03-14-25_Gobble_009.jpg"></a></figure><p><strong>■ Project Name: <em>Kyouran</em></strong></p><ul><li><strong>Platforms:</strong> PlayStation 5, Switch</li><li><strong>Release Date:</strong> 2026</li><li><strong>Genre:</strong> <a title="Genres > Action RPG [1,528 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/rpg/action-rpg">Action RPG</a></li></ul><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/NIS-New-Titles_03-14-25_Kyouran_001.jpg"></a></figure><p><em>Kyouran</em> is an action RPG developed by the main staff behind the <em><a title="Series > Disgaea [34 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/series/disgaea">Disgaea</a></em> series.

This is done by using the powers of a goat monster, which can eat and destroy the picture book world, and a girl who can alter the paper-made backgrounds within the book’s world.</p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/NIS-New-Titles_03-14-25_Shinigami-Hime_002.jpg"></a></figure><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/NIS-New-Titles_03-14-25_Shinigami-Hime_003.jpg"></a></figure><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/NIS-New-Titles_03-14-25_Shinigami-Hime_004.jpg"></a></figure></div><p>Watch the full archive of the Nippon Ichi Software UNTITLED// event below.</p></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Since it was first revealed, Rebellion's upcoming game <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/atomfall/" data-ref-id="5000-631970">Atomfall</a> has often been compared to Bethesda's Fallout. While both games do share a few similarities--from post-apocalyptic themes to killer robots--Rebellion says the game is more than just Fallout with a British coat of paint.</p><p>"Once you play it for a bit, you're like, 'oh, this is its own thing for sure,'" art director Ryan Greene explained to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-atomfall-developers-knew-it-would-be-compared-to-fallout-as-soon-as-it-was-revealed-average-playthrough-around-25-hours" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN</a>. "And one of our owners, Jason Kingsley, he's a big Fallout fan, so inevitably there was going to be some parallels in that any kind of survival in the apocalypse, immediately Fallout's going to come up as a thing. And those guys are great at what they do. And that's cool. The reality is, here's this very successful franchise and we're version 1.0. To be compared to those guys--thank you very much--yes, we appreciate it because that’s a skillful team that's making that stuff."</p><p>Another key differentiator in the game is its lack of a traditional main quest, as players will instead work their way through several interconnected stories that all eventually connect to the overarching mystery of the game. Greene added that Atomfall will even allow you to adopt a non-lethal approach to playing the game, and he's "fairly certain" that the game can be completed without needing to kill a single person.</p><p>In his hands-on impressions of Atomfall, GameSpot's Jake Dekkeras wrote about how the game has more in common with cult-classic investigative adventure <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/paradise-killer/" data-ref-id="5000-506065">Paradise Killer</a> than Fallout.</p><div tabindex="0" data-id="1933864494" data-promo-id="0" data-user-has-ads="1"

detective game. Yes, the post-apocalyptic first-person shooter from the Sniper Elite studio feels more like Paradise Killer than Fallout. Rather than ping-ponging between objective markers around a map, Atomfall's story is structured around a series of clues that are organically picked up and tracked as you explore its world. Its quests are nonlinear and you're gently guided to points of interest," Dekker wrote in GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/atomfall-is-a-detective-game-in-a-post-apocalyptic-england/1100-6529960/">Atomfall preview</a>. "From there, it's on you to reference your quest log and put the story of its world together."</p><p>Atomfall will launch for PC, PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X|S, and Xbox One on March 27, and it'll also be a day-one release through Game Pass.</p>

                <p>Konami is alerting players that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/silent-hill-f/" data-ref-id="5000-574203">Silent Hill f</a> features a range of potentially upsetting topics, including depictions of gender discrimination, child abuse, bullying, drug-induced hallucinations, torture, and graphic violence. A <a href="https://www.konami.com/games/silenthill/f/us/en/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">notice on the game's website</a> mentions this, along with Konami's statement about how the content in the game does not reflect the opinions of people involved with making the game. This all came about as part of the Silent Hill Transmission livestream <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/silent-hill-f-cinematic-trailer-brings-small-town-horror-to-japan/1100-6530124/" data-ref-id="1100-6530124">where a new trailer also debuted.</a></p><p>"This game is set in Japan in the 1960s and contains depictions based on the customs and culture of that time. These depictions do not reflect the opinions or values of the developers or any individuals involved," Konami said. "If you feel uncomfortable at any point while playing, please take a break from playing or speak to someone you trust."</p><p>Silent Hill f carries an M rating from the ESRB. The <a href="https://www.esrb.org/ratings/40315/silent-hill-f/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">ESRB's ratings description</a> says the game's cutscenes show "gore and more

            <p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/pokemon-go">Pokémon Go</a> looks set to let you increase the stats of your Pokémon, fans say, after code snippets relating to the feature were spotted in a fresh datamine. 
</p>
<p>
References to systems for a "stat increase" as well as to a "Hyper Training Service" have been found by <a href="https://x.com/thepokemodgroup/status/1900247443666854310">prolific Pokémon Go dataminers The Pokemod Group</a>, and suggest players will be able to boost a Pokémon's attack, defense or stamina.
</p>
<p>
Hyper Training is a feature from the main Pokémon games that allows you to max out a creature's stats - referred to as its IVs - using a currency known as Bottle Caps.
</p>
<p>
The system means you can turn a Pokémon with good stats into one with better or even perfect stats, making it more competitive in battles, including with other players.
</p>
<p>
Pokémon Go has never had a system like this before, though fans have long discussed how it might work. On the one hand, the ability to boost stats brings with it questions of balance, and concerns over how much a Bottle Cap might be sold for. 
</p>
<p>
On the other, there are plenty of players with 98% stat Pokémon who would love to turn them into perfect 100% Pokémon instead, and secure a "hundo".
</p>
<p>
In Pokémon Go, hardcore fans play and pay repeatedly for the chance to earn hundo stat Pokémon from raid battles, with hundreds of tries likely needed. Any item that could be used to shortcut this system would be a major shakeup, and likely be highly valued.
</p>
<p>
Naturally, the suggestion this potentially-lucrative feature is coming to Pokémon Go now has led to discussion among fans that this is a design decision driven by changes to the ownership of the game.
</p>
<p>
Earlier this week, it was confirmed that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-go-will-be-sold-to-monopoly-go-maker-scopely-niantic-confirms">developer Niantic planned to sell Pokémon Go to Monopoly Go maker Scopely</a>, as part of a $3.5bn deal.
</p>
<p>
Eurogamer has contacted Niantic for more.
