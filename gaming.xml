            <p>
Previously unseen concept art purportedly showing character designs from <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/warner-bros-games-montreal">Warner Bros. Games Montreal</a>'s cancelled <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/batman-arkham-knight">Batman: Arkham Knight</a> follow-up Project Sabbath has surfaced online, showing further glimpses of a beardy Bruce Wayne, Damian Wayne, and more.
</p>
<p>
Whispers of Project Sabbath's existence first emerged back in 2016, with Batman: Arkham Oranges developer Warner Bros. Games Montreal said to be at the helm. Along the way, however, Project Sabbath was ditched in favour of what would ultimately become the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gotham-knights-review-batman-minus-batman-is-scrappy-but-riddled-with-charm">rather middling Gotham Knights</a>, and much of what we know about the cancelled game has been gleaned through various bits of concept art that've emerged over the years.
</p>
<p>
In 2019, for instance, concept art from Project Sabbath - which would supposedly see Bruce Wayne's son Damian donning the famous cowl and cape - popped up on 4chan, showing off various elements including an older Bruce Wayne, a rundown Gotham City, Gorilla Grodd, and more. All that was accompanied by claims the game would have used <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/middle-earth-shadow-of-mordor">Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor</a>'s acclaimed Nemesis System. Additional concept art then <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/batman-arkham-knight-canned-sequel-apparently-shown-via-concept-art">emerged two years later</a>, offering closer looks at both Bruce and Damien.
</p>
<p>
And now, yet more Project Sabbath concept art has emerged, this time from character artist Rodrigue Pralier, who worked at Warner Bros. Games Montreal circa 2014/2015. Although the Artstation page originally featuring the concepts has now been removed, the images have been <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/arkhamvideos.bsky.social/post/3ls75vje3d22d">saved for posterity on social media</a>, revealing a further look at Damian Wayne and his beardy pa Bruce, alongside Killer Croc, The Huntress, and more.

<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/gotham-knights">Gotham Knights</a> - the title WB Games Montreal switched its attention to after ditching Project Sabbath - did, of course, fail to generate much enthusiasm among critics and fans, and it was followed in 2024 by Arkham Knight studio Rocksteady's Suicide: Kill the Justice League. That proved to be <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-fails-to-meet-warner-bros-expectations">another Batman-adjacent flop</a> in a year that also saw Harry Potter: Quidditch Champions underperform and the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/multiversus-to-shut-down-until-2024-with-no-refunds-for-paying-players">limp return of Warner's now-cancelled MultiVersus</a>.
</p>
<p>
At the start of this year - following <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gotham-knights-developer-warner-bros-games-montreal-slashes-99-jobs">several rounds</a> of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-developer-rocksteady-hit-by-end-of-year-layoffs">layoffs</a> across its studios - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/warner-bros-games">Warner Bros. Games</a> boss David Haddad <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/warner-bros-games-boss-david-haddad-departs-following-rocky-period-for-publisher">departed the company</a>. Just a month later Warner Bros. announced it was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/warner-bros-reportedly-cancels-wonder-woman-closes-monolith-and-other-studios">cancelling Monolith Productions' long-in-the-works Wonder Woman game</a>, closing the studio, and shutting down Player First Games and Warner Bros. Games San Diego too. Since then, it's announced a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/warner-bros-games-restructures-leadership-team-following-new-focus-on-game-of-thrones-dc-harry-potter-and-mortal-kombat">drastic shift in leadership</a> that'll see it refocusing on several core brands, including Mortal Kombat, Harry Potter, DC, and Game of Thrones.

                <p>Hytale has been canceled by Riot Games and Hypixel Studios a decade after the project first started development.</p><p>Hypixel Studios' co-founder Aaron Donaghey, better known by the Hytale community as Noxy, broke the news in a <a href="https://hytale.com/news/2025/6/a-difficult-update-about-hytale" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">post on Hytale's website</a>. "Today, I shared some incredibly tough news with the Hypixel Studios team: we’re ending development on <em>Hytale</em> and beginning the process of winding down Hypixel Studios over the next few months," Noxy wrote. "This is not the outcome any of us - at Hypixel or at Riot - wanted. But after years of pushing forward, adapting, and exploring every possible path, it became clear we couldn’t bring Hytale to life in a way that truly delivered on its promise."</p><p>Hytale is a standalone game project that sprouted from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypixel" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Hypixel</a>, the popular <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/minecraft/" data-ref-id="5000-73990">Minecraft</a> server from which Hytale's development team gets its name. It was planned to be a Minecraft-like sandbox game that was more modder-friendly, incorporated more RPG elements, and featured numerous minigames for players to try out alongside the basic sandbox experience. To better understand the project's ambitions, you should watch this developer diary that Riot Games released in 2021.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GWW28OCIkNE" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/GWW28OCIkNE" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Noxy's post about Hytale's cancellation essentially admits that this was all too ambitious for the studio. That can be seen in the project's lengthy development timeline. The project has roots going all the way <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hytale-is-a-brand-new-game-from-giants-of-the-minecraft-community" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">back to 2015</a>, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/riot-has-bought-the-developer-behind-a-minecraft-l/1100-6476132/" data-ref-id="1100-6476132">Riot Games acquired Hypixel</a> in 2020, yet no release was in sight.</p><p>Noxy admits that "it became clear we’d need a lot more time to get it to a place where it could support the ambitious vision for the game," even after a complete overhaul of the game engine being used to make <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/hytale/" data-ref-id="5000-507834">Hytale</a>. Rather than reducing the scope or adjusting the development timeline to make the project a reality, Hypixel Studios and Riot decided to cancel the game entirely.</p><p>Hypixel Studios will be shut down as a result, although Noxy says Hypixel's developers are being "supported with generous severance and resources to help them find what’s next." As for the Hypixel server that Hytale is based on, Noxy's message explains that it is run separately from Hypixel Studios and will not be impacted by Hytale's cancellation.</p>

As spotted <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/wario64.bsky.social/post/3lscg5aodzt2a">by @Wario64</a>, Valve has started selling the device <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fsteamdeck%2F" rel="sponsored">on its online store</a> again after it was out of stock in the US and Canada for over a week.</p><p>Earlier this month, <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/steam-deck-oled-out-of-stock">Valve cited</a> “recent supply chain constraints” for the Steam Deck OLED’s unavailability, adding that it expects the device to come back in stock by the end of the summer. It looks like Valve may have resolved its supply chain issues — at least for now — as the 512GB Steam Deck OLED is currently on sale for $549, while the 1TB version is available for $649.</p><p>Both devices come with a 7.4-inch HDR OLED display, up to a 90Hz refresh rate, a carrying case, and battery life ranging from three to 12 hours, depending on content. The 1TB version adds a “premium anti-glare etched glass” display, a removable liner with the carrying case, and an exclusive startup screen and virtual keyboard theme. However, neither model includes the Steam Deck Docking Station, which is available separately for $79 (there <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/6/30/23776368/jsaux-rgb-dock-steam-deck-rog-ally-aya-neo">are plenty</a> of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/8/23/23843324/gulikit-steam-deck-rog-ally-dock-super-nintendo-snes-xbox-elite-gamepad">third-party</a> options out there, too.)</p><p>But if you’re still holding out for a Switch 2, the $450 console has been popping up intermittently at retailers like Walmart, Target, and Best Buy.</p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/691604/steam-deck-oled-valve-in-stock]]></content:encoded>

                <p>EA has revealed some of the major changes coming to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/ea-sports-college-football-26/" data-ref-id="5000-675130">College Football 26</a>, and a clear theme has emerged. The company is significantly expanding in-game representations of college traditions, such as mascots, rivalry trophies, marching band formations, and other elements of school spirit. Included among a huge list of additions is one of the few mascots that everyone, regardless of allegiance, seems to be able to root for: a Pop-Tart.</p><p>Yes, one of the internet's favorite mascots is coming to CFB 26, EA announced in <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/ea-sports-college-football/college-football-26/news/cfb26-campus-huddle-presentation?cid=84496&amp;ts=1750691127277" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">a blog post</a>.. The anthropomorphic toaster pastry has become beloved among college football fans for its role in the Pop-Tarts Bowl, arguably the most eccentric bowl game among the dozens of bowls in college football's postseason. To put it simply: At the end of the game, the giant Pop-Tart gets put into a toaster, and then an edible version emerges, to be promptly ripped apart and consumed by the winning team.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZ6HoJdHslI" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ZZ6HoJdHslI" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>The tasty (but somewhat macabre) mascot aside, EA is also expanding the school mascots that'll appear in the game. Over 30 new mascots are being added, bringing more realistic school spirit for universities like Army, Navy, Kansas, Colorado State, and others.</p><p>Other aspects of school traditions are also being enhanced. EA is recreating band formations, light shows, drone shows, and different types of run-outs for some universities, adding additional showmanship and pageantry to games. More of college football's large array of rivalry trophies will be represented in CFB 26, too.</p><p>CFB 26 launches on July 10, but people who preorder special editions of the game can get access three days early. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-sports-college-football-26-preorder-bonus-ps5-xbox-series-x-releases-july-10/1100-6531106/" data-ref-id="1100-6531106">Check out our preorder guide</a> for more on the different versions of the game. EA is likely hoping that CFB 26 can replicate its predecessor's success; CFB 25 was wildly popular and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cfb-26-officially-unveiled-with-reveal-trailer-and-first-details-on-whats-new-this-year/1100-6531900/" data-ref-id="1100-6531900">produced over $1 billion in revenue for the company</a>.</p>

    <p><em>Civilization VII</em> has a lot of visual polish, and great gameplay systems. A flurry of patches have been improving other aspects, too.

<p>It has been just over 130 days since <em>Civilization VII</em> launched to mostly positive reviews—but quite a bit of disappointment for series traditionalists. At first, developer Firaxis was releasing primarily bug, balance, and UI fixes, but today saw the release of version 1.2.2—possibly the biggest yet in terms of adding features to the game.</p>
<p>Available for all platforms except Switch and Switch 2—which will get it later—the update adds several tweaks that allow the game's players to customize games in a more granular way, with a particular emphasis on the ability to disable controversial new additions that a subset of players felt took things too far from the traditional Civ experience.</p>
<p>Many of the new options are available in the advanced settings menu during game setup, though one of the major additions is in the standard setup screen: large and huge map sizes. (Both of these new sizes have a default civilization/player count of 10.)</p>
<h2>RIP Legacy Paths and Crisis (if you want)</h2>
<p>The biggest change is the option to disable Legacy Paths.</p>
<p>Legacy Paths are structured sequences of objectives that lead to major rewards as the player transitions from one Age of history to another. They add some fun new gameplay approaches and dovetail nicely with the other systems in the game, but traditionalists felt they added a bit too much structure to the game, which has roots in a more sandbox-style design.</p>
<p>You can now disable any specific Legacy Path for any Age, or you can just turn them all off, which makes the game more open-ended, akin to earlier entries in the franchise. <em>Civilization VII</em>'s radical Age transitions are still in place, though.</p>

          
                      
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>Some fans are also calling for Firaxis to allow players to disable the new Ages system entirely, but the developers haven't said they're working on that—and we'd be surprised if they did, frankly, as distinct Ages are foundational to the game's design in a way not even Legacy Paths are.</p>
<p>That's not where the options to turn off tentpole <em>Civilization VII</em> features end, though. You can also individually or completely turn off Crisis, the urgency mechanics that kick in near the end of Ages.</p>
<p>While I know many <em>Civilization VII </em>players who like Legacy Paths, I've hardly spoken to anyone who enjoys Crisis (though I'm sure they exist somewhere), so this will be a particularly welcome change for many.</p>


<p>The last tentpole <em>Civilization VII</em> feature you can now turn off is Civ unlocks during age transitions. A key design choice of <em>Civilization VII</em> that contrasts with prior titles is the fact that you pick a new civilization when you transition between Ages. At launch, your options for which civ to pick were limited by the choices you'd made in the previous age. That's still the default, but now you can set the game up from the start to not have that limitation, meaning you can switch to any civ you want each time the Age changes.</p>
<p>As a bonus, you can also disable score victory at the end of the Modern Age, which allows for infinite play, similar to the "one more turn" option in prior Civ titles. That's something players on the Civilization subreddit have been requesting for months. Previously, the game would abruptly end as soon as the Modern Age ended and scores were tallied.</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<h2>More granular difficulty options</h2>
<p>There are two more things of note that Firaxis has added to the advanced settings during game setup. First, you can fine-tune the difficulty settings by picking a different difficulty level for each aspect of the game. For example, you can set combat strength for AI players to Viceroy difficulty, while using the Happiness rules for Settler.</p>
<p>There has already been some confusion about this feature, though, as it's hard to find. It was promised in the patch notes, then players took to Reddit and YouTube to complain that it's not actually present in the patch. It is, but you have to set the top-level difficulty to the newly available "custom" value before you can see these options.</p>


<p>The last game setup addition is the option to change how friendly or hostile independent powers tend to be, which is welcome for players who prefer building to fighting, especially in the Antiquity Age.</p>

<h2>Mod support and other gameplay changes</h2>
<p>The <em>Civilization VII</em> community has already been modding, but that required the old-school approach of mucking around in files and folders. Now, Firaxis has introduced official mod support, including distribution via Steam Workshop, documentation, and some example mods made by the dev team.</p>
<p>There's also a new loading screen with more detailed information and more interactive elements, which Firaxis says is a hint at other major UI overhauls to come. That said, players have already complained that it doesn't look very nice because the 2D leader assets that appear on it have been scaled awkwardly and look fuzzy.</p>
<p>The remaining changes are largely balance and systems-related. Trade convoys can now travel over land, which means treasure ships will no longer get stuck in lakes, and there are broader strategic options for tackling the economic path in the Exploration Age. There has been a significant effort to overhaul town focuses, including the addition of a couple new ones, and the much-anticipated nerf of the Hub Town focus; it now provides +1 influence per connected town instead of two, though that may still not be quite enough to make the Hub Town, well, not overpowered.</p>

    <div>

        
        <div>
          
          
<p>You can find a bunch of other small balance tweaks in <a href="https://civilization.2k.com/civ-vii/game-update-notes/">the patch notes</a>, including new city-state bonuses, pantheons, and religious beliefs, among other things.</p>
<p>Lastly, and perhaps most importantly to some, you can now issue a command to pet the scout unit's dog.</p>
<h2>Next steps</h2>
<p>As far as I can tell, there are still two major traditional features fans are waiting on: autoexplore for scout units and hotseat multiplayer support. Firaxis says it's working on both, but neither made it into 1.2.2. Players have also been asking for further UI overhauls. Firaxis says those are coming, too.</p>
<p>When <em>Civilization VII</em> launched, I wrote <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/02/civilization-vii-review-a-major-overhaul-solves-civs-oldest-problems/">that I quite liked it</a>, but I also pointed out bugs and balance changes and noted that it won't please traditionalists. For some players, the review said it might be better to wait. We did a follow-up article about a month in, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/03/civilization-vii-one-month-later-the-community-and-developers-chime-in/">interviewing the developers</a>. But that was still during the "fix things that are on fire stage."</p>
<p>More than any previous update, today's 1.2.2 is the first one that seems like a natural jumping-on point for people who have been taking a wait-and-see approach.</p>
<p>It's quite common for strategy games like this to not really fully hit their stride until weeks or even months of updates. <em>Civilization VII</em>'s UI problems made it a particularly notable example of that trend, but the good news is that it's also following the same path as the games before it that got good post-launch support: slowly, it's becoming a game a broader range of Civ fans can enjoy.</p>

The studio announced recently that the game launches on August 5 for Android devices, with the first two chapters offered for free as a demo.</p><p>Rather than a direct port, ZA/UM has rebuilt the game in an attempt to make it better complement smaller devices. While the original Disco Elysium is an isometric story-based RPG with full movement controls, the mobile version repackages the art style, characters, and narrative into something more akin to a visual novel. It is now played from a first-person point of view, but you're not moving the character. Rather, you survey rooms and look for items or points of interest to investigate, and all of the interactivity is designed around touch screens.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> ‘Disco Elysium For The TikTok User’ Gave Me An Existential Crisis</p>
      </div>
<p>ZA/UM has talked about how this approach is an effort to "completely cater to the habits of today's mobile users." In addition, the developer is emphasizing that the mobile version is more compatible with quick, pick-up-and-play gaming, stating, "This story-rich adventure has been optimized for short play sessions, allowing players to dive in anytime, anyplace on their mobile devices."</p><p>While this type of description might dissuade some players from checking this version out, GameSpot recently had a chance to preview the game on an Android tablet and came away quite impressed. Check out early impressions from our own Lucy James in the embed above.</p><p>If you try out the free chapters and want to grab the full game, Disco Elysium for Android will cost $10 when it launches on August 5. ZA/UM has not yet announced details about an iOS release, but chances are good that it'll come to more devices in the future.</p><p>This might be the only new Disco Elysium-related product in the works, though. Following <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/disco-elysium-expansion-and-sequel-canceled-report/1100-6521118/" data-ref-id="1100-6521118">significant upheaval and controversy</a>, ZA/UM canceled a sequel and expansion and shifted its focus to a new title, called <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/disco-elysium-studios-next-rpg-is-a-paranoid-spy-thriller/1100-6530033/" data-ref-id="1100-6530033">Project C4</a>. Highlighting espionage, intelligence, and betrayal, the game will be an RPG inspired by novels like Tinker Tailor Soldier Spy.</p>

		<p>A new developer diary from Bloober Team has revealed more about how combat works in <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/cronos-the-new-dawn">Cronos: The New Dawn</a>, their new and original sci-fi horror game.</p>
<p><iframe title="Cronos: The New Dawn | Deep Dive into The Combat" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qWVTXo05K7s?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Combat in Cronos is defined by The Merge, an evolving threat that can dynamically transform each encounter. Enemies known as Orphans can absorb corpses that transforms them mid-battle into more dangerous forms. As they do this, they gain new abilities, forcing the player to adapt their approach and change weapons, but the fascinating twist is that as you kill Orphans, this provides more fodder for others to consume and transform from, building out from traditional archetypes like runners, bruisers and the like.</p>
<p>Bloober’s Jacek Zieba and Shamil Yanbukhtin explain how the encounters have all been hand-crafted to present different opportunities to players, and avoid pigeon-holing them into a single approach. You can use the environment to lure enemies out to give you the advantage, or if you’re super confident in your abilities, go ultra-aggressive and get close enough for melee.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/17/bloober-team-reveal-cronos-the-new-dawn/">Announced last October</a>, Cronos: The New Dawn’s takes place in a post-apocalyptic rendition of 1980s Poland. This is the home to a survival horror adventure with some hefty helpings of sci-fi and time travel. You’ll play as a time-hopping Traveller, going back through time rifts to try and extract people who didn’t survive the apocalypse. Some of the most notable inspirations include the Dead Space franchise and the movie Twelve Monkeys. The Traveller’s own suit takes its inspiration from older deep sea diving suits, alluding to the theme of diving through time to save people.</p>

<p>Bloober has been dishing out occasional behind-the-scenes and Q&amp;A videos like this, gradually teasing out what to expect from this horror title. We look forward to the next entry.</p>
<p>Cronos: The New Dawn is coming to PS5, Xbox Series X|S and PC later this year.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			<div><header>Game Info</header><div>
							<h5>Platform</h5><p><span>PC, PS5, Xbox Series X/S</span>
						</p></div></div>			
			<p>When I first saw that Sifu developer Sloclap would be shifting gears to make a football game with <a href="https://wccftech.com/sifu-developer-sloclap-has-announced-a-release-date-for-its-new-soccer-game-rematch/">Rematch</a>, I would be lying if I didn't say I was a little disappointed. I like football and sports games well enough. I don't necessarily play EA Sports FC every year, but I've always liked hitting the pitch with my friends, and getting between the posts to make some killer saves, since my preferred position is playing goalie.</p>
<p>I loved Sifu when it released in 2022. It was one of my favorite games that year because of how mechanically tight the gameplay was and how strong the cinematic and visual presentation was. For me, it succeeded at placing me in the middle of a martial arts movie, the perspective shifts that would happen in the levels, the excellent environmental settings for each boss fight, and just how good every punch, kick, and block felt to execute.</p>
<p>I'm ready for Sifu round 2 whenever Sloclap is ready to make it. All this to say, Rematch was not what I expected to see from Sloclap, nor was it exactly what I wanted, which is why I was so delighted when I first played Rematch. I was immediately struck by how tight the gameplay is and how good it feels to do just about everything in Rematch, in the same way it feels good to do everything in Sifu.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>That said, there's a lot about Rematch that I don't like, and so much of that comes from its structure.</p>
<p>But first, the things I do like. On a foundational level, it feels good to shoot, pass, and slide into a tackle. Doing anything, basically, on the pitch feels strong. Dribbling was the only element that took some time for me to get used to.</p>
<p>It also takes some time to get used to controlling the camera while watching for the ball to keep up with the play. You can have a mini-map in the corner of your screen if you like, but keeping track of the action in front of you while covering the map has its learning curve. Funny enough, I do wish there was some version of the camera solution that <a href="http://wccftech.com/review/review-rocket-league-wacky-vehicle-mayhem/">Rocket League</a> has for the same issue.</p>
<p>That said, getting there is a really satisfying learning curve to getting a handle on the controls. Once you start to feel like you can keep an eye on the flow of the game, while maintaining position, and be ready to know what to do when the ball is coming your way, the game opens up in a huge way.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>So much so that I feel confident saying that Rematch is one of the best sports games I've played in years. I can't say for certain that it's because of the focused camera angle, the airtight mechanics, whether you're out on the field or in the keeper's box, or the arcade, backyard-pitch-focused approach to football. It's a bit of everything that makes it a special experience I want to return to, whether I'm playing a 3v3, 4v4, or 5v5 match. Each are balanced by just how good the gameplay is at its core, and it all keeps me coming back.</p>
<p>And that's despite all the things that bring the experience down. The menu, for starters, is about as good as every other major sports game released each year, which is that its somehow, pretty bad. Even with so few game modes to choose from, Rematch aims to emulate its annual sports sim-game peers with blocky, uninspired menu designs, though that also partly comes from the overall bland look the game has.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>Having the 'Prologue' remain as an option in the main menu of the game, for example, is a grievous offence in my book. Even if I had only miss-pressed the prologue one time, I'd hate the fact that it was there. I can understand someone wanting to replay the prologue if there were practice drills included in it that weren't already available in the game's dedicated 'Practice' mode. But that's absolutely not the case.</p>
<p>Perhaps I'm harping on a small detail that doesn't matter, and it is a small detail, but it's ludicrous to me that it remains in the main menu where it serves no purpose other than to frustrate you after you accidentally click it and have to wait for the chance to pause and head back to the main menu to access either the Practice menu, or the Systems menu, both of which are options players would actually use.</p>
<p>Again, it's a small point, but it speaks to the larger structural issues that Rematch has. The Practice mode, for example, has a small number of drills demonstrating each area of the game, but there's no "Retry" option when you complete a drill. You're just sent back to the main menu, and have to navigate your way back to the drill if you want to do it again. It's all the more mind-boggling due to the fact that you can aim for bronze, silver, and gold medals on each drill.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>There's also no option to play the same team you just played in an online match. It's almost astounding, really, that there's no option to have a rematch in a game called Rematch. Besides the fact that I think these are poor UI/UX design decisions, what annoys me most about them is the fact that with a press of a button, you can be on the pitch in a free-roaming practice mode. It's a wonderful inclusion that I wish every sports game had, and it makes me all the more confused as to why the rest of the menu design is lacking.</p>
<p>Then there's the whole live service lean to Rematch, which is already a premium title and not a free-to-play game. I can appreciate working towards an unlockable cosmetic as much as the next person, and I'm well aware that having microtransactions in premium games is absolutely nothing new, but I certainly don't have to like it. Especially when the cosmetics you're working towards, that are also purchasable through the game's premium coins that you can buy with real money (or earn in gameplay) don't look all that enticing.</p>
<p>Your mileage may vary on the various hairstyles, shoes, and clothing you can unlock to customize your character with, or the stadium designs you can unlock for practice and matches, but as I mentioned earlier, the overall design of the game is quite bland to me.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>It's serviceable. Gets the job done, and that's basically my main issue with it. The character models are the only element of it that make it stand out as a Sloclap game, since they look like the same models the studio has been evolving since <a href="https://wccftech.com/absolver-downfall-free-expansion/">Absolver</a>. Three games in, I get that a serviceable design in favor of tighter gameplay and gameplay mechanics is basically Sloclap's trademark. But it's not a positive mark on the studio that, outside of trying to emulate a visual framework like how Sifu was a tailored-down version of martial arts films and their gamut of visual languages, that Sloclap can't seem to define its own visual language that stands out in a crowd.</p>
<p>I'm even more pained by its design and live service bent when I consider that the time spent making cosmetics for players to chase in a battle-pass structure that every studio seems to think is necessary for games these days is time that was taken away from developing a single-player-focused season mode or campaign to play through.</p>

<figure></figure>


<p>I do genuinely love the core gameplay of Rematch, and I've enjoyed each match I've played, win or lose, but I'm also the kind of sports game-player who appreciates the offline-focused modes that let me have a no-stakes game where I don't run the risk of being berated by toxic players abusing the message function to tell me "Good job" after I make a mistake.</p>
<p>The lack of any offline season or tournament mode not only makes it feel like there's really not much to do in Rematch, it also brings up concerns about what happens to Rematch if/when Sloclap ends their support for the game. As of now, if Sloclap were to stop running the servers tomorrow, there'd be no way to experience a proper match, and like so many other online-only games, it would be up to the community to keep things going. Which is a lot of legwork that not everyone who plays and loves Rematch will be willing to do.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>I'd also be remiss if I didn't mention that the rug-pull of <a href="https://wccftech.com/sloclap-rematch-wont-support-cross-play-at-launch/">no cross-play support hours before launch</a> doesn't leave a good taste in the mouth, nor does all the<a href="https://wccftech.com/sloclap-pushes-hotfix-for-rematch-network-stability-issues-as-rematch-hits-1-million-unique-players-in-first-24hrs/"> bugs and networking issues</a> I've faced along with the rest of the community since the game has been live. These issues will get resolved in time, so they're not the biggest concern, but they are annoying for players jumping in at launch. When I wasn't having networking issues though, the performance was more than solid on both my laptop and desktop.</p>
<p>Ultimately, Rematch is an incredibly solid arcade football game, that is able to capture that feeling of getting a bunch of friends together and kicking a ball around at the local park, elevated by the fact that my avatar in Rematch is far, far better than I could ever be in football, and capable of incredibly acrobatic stunts for some spectacular highlight reels.</p>

<p>I love how solid it feels, whether I'm between the pipes or out on the pitch, and how intense the matches can get whether I'm playing the ranked 5v5 mode or the more casual 3v3. But the lack of content, poor design choices, and a lacking art style combined with a slow-progressing battle pass-like structure and less-than-inspired unlockable cosmetics cut the whole package of Rematch at its knees.</p>

						<section>
				<p>Rematch is arguably the best sports game I've played in years, and that comes down to the air-tight mechanics at the core of its gameplay, and how good it feels to dribble, make a pass, take a shot, or make a save - all of which wonderfully balances its 3v3, 4v4, and 5v5 game modes. It's tackled at the knees by everything around that core gameplay, from its poor UI/UX menu design, to its uninspired visual style and the fact that it currently lacks any offline game modes, and, at least at launch, the several networking issues and bugs that plague the experience.</p>

I wasn’t expecting that at all.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197586" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Disney+ Pulls The Abyss Over Controversial Rat Scene — Again" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="128" data-playlist="197586,197585,197583" data-current="197586"><div><p>Disney+ Pulls The Abyss Over Controversial Rat Scene — Again</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197586/197586_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197586/197586_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197586/197586_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/23107.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>I’m not a soccer fan. I find the sport boring to watch. I’ve never liked any soccer video games. I outright hated EA’s <em>FIFA </em>series any time I was forced to play it for a few minutes. I didn’t even love<em> Rocket League.</em> And yet, I stayed up until 2 a.m. over the weekend playing a soccer game. And I did it again the next night. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/rematch-does-it-have-crossplay-launch-no-xbox-ps5-pc-1851784595&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/rematch-does-it-have-crossplay-launch-no-xbox-ps5-pc-1851784595">That’s because <em>Rematch</em>, out now,</a></span> is unlike any other soccer game I’ve played or seen. It captures the best parts of the sport while excising the junk. The result is amazing. </p><p>Most modern soccer games are played from a high-up perspective, and you’re asked to control the entire team all at once. In these games, you aren’t really <em>playing </em>soccer, but instead controlling a match from afar like a weird soccer god. For fans of the sport, like my brother, this can be fun enough. But <em>Rematch</em>, out now on Xbox, PS5, and PC, is very, very different. In <em>Rematch</em>, you control one player throughout the whole match. The camera is located directly behind you, and every other player on the pitch (I Googled that) is controlled by another player.</p><p>Those changes alone are enough to make <em>Rematch</em> stand out from <em>FIFA</em> and similar soccer games. (No, I won’t call it football.) But that alone is not why I keep playing the colorful and stylized <em>Rematch</em>. No, what has me hooked is how it plays. </p><p>Moving, sliding, shooting, blocking, and passing in <em>Rematch</em> feel wonderful. Everything is snappy and responsive. When my brother charges up the middle and I’m being attacked by two players, I can effortlessly hit one button to slip the ball behind me, maneuver past the defenders, and pass it to my bro without even looking. Other times, a long pass will be hurled to me and I can run up to it and bicycle kick it into the goal, adding a bit of bend to the shot before it goes in. </p><p>All of this feels great, and once you’ve learned the controls, it’s a blast. Thankfully, the opening tutorial gives you just enough of the basics that you’ll be set to hold your own online. As you play more, you’ll learn more ways to combine the controls and techniques you were taught into more complicated and impressive moves. For example, you can flick the ball over your head and kick it in midair, aiming not to score but to bounce it off the wall above the goal, hopefully throwing off the goalie in the process and setting up a teammate to finish the shot.</p><p>Oh, right, the wall around the field. I forgot to mention that. See, the soccer in <em>Rematch </em>isn’t normal soccer. There are no yellow or red cards. No penalties. Instead, the game of soccer has been distilled down into its simplest form. Two goals, a pitch, a few players, and the ability for goalies to touch the ball with their hands. That’s it. And around you is a giant clear wall that stops balls from flying out of bounds. (This wall also changes during the match via fancy AR-tech to display wild settings, like being in space or in a jungle.) You can use this wall to bounce passes off at weird angles, too. </p><figure id="" data-id="0a42ab144b49c3c6b3a1b8a02cde6e19" data-recommend-id="image://0a42ab144b49c3c6b3a1b8a02cde6e19" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Sloclap</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="0a42ab144b49c3c6b3a1b8a02cde6e19" data-recommend-id="image://0a42ab144b49c3c6b3a1b8a02cde6e19" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>When playing <em>Rematch</em>, I almost felt like a kid playing basketball on a small court in the park with my friends. We didn’t follow most of the rules. No, instead we just played a pure form of basketball that was focused on being fun and exicting, letting us do wild shit and make really dumb mistakes. <em>Rematch</em> recaptures that feeling of playing a sport in its purest, simplest form. And it’s exhilarating.</p><p><em>Rematch </em>is also filled with smart, tiny design choices that keep matches flowing. If a team goes up four goals, the game ends due to a mercy rule. No dragged-out matches against much better teams. There are four options to communicate, and if you spam any of them, like saying “Thanks” or “Sorry” too much, you’ll be blocked from using them for a bit. Anyone can be the goalie, just drop back to the goal and if you’re alone, you become the goalie, giving you increased stamina and the ability to catch and hold the ball. Don’t want to be the goalie, walk away. Simple as that.</p><p>There are no stats to manage, perks to unlock, cards to earn, or anything like that. There’s a basic battle pass system, but it’s just cosmetics like new shirts and socks. The rest of the game is lean and focused. If <em>Rematch’s </em>developers set out to make a soccer game that is badass, super fast, and very fun, that is also easy to pick up play, while having a ton of depth for those who are willing to sink dozens of hours into it, well, job well done. <em>Rematch</em> is the best soccer game I’ve ever played. And it’s one of the best games of 2025 so far. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/rematch-game-ps5-xbox-game-pass-review-soccer-crossplay-1851784959]]></content:encoded>

"Our goal is not to force PvE players to interact with a PvP system that they may have no interest in."</p><p dir="ltr">While PvE players will now be able to venture in the Deep Desert, Bylos said those who are playing solo will find the experience grindy. The endgame will remain balanced around guilds and groups, and the most lucrative resources and spice fields in the Deep Desert will still be high-risk, high-reward PvP zones, he said.</p><p dir="ltr">Bylos additionally addressed the Scout Ornithopter meta that is currently dominating warfare in the Deep Desert, in which the flying vehicles have become essential to competitive play. Having recently <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dune-awakening-patch-notes-fix-frustrating-endgame-pvp-problems/1100-6532538/" data-ref-id="1100-6532538">removed the ability to deal damage</a> to other players by ramming them with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-to-unlock-craft-and-repair-all-dune-awakening-vehicles/1100-6532312/" data-ref-id="1100-6532312">vehicles</a>, Funcom will soon introduce even more changes to bring the all-mighty Ornithopter down a few notches. Those changes will range from bigger penalties for those who equip Scout Ornithopters with rockets, to an additional way for players to deal with the thopters in the form of a new rocket launcher. Bylos said that Ornithopters, while important, shouldn't be dominant force in PvP battles</p><p dir="ltr">"We have infantry and ground vehicles and air vehicles, and they're all supposed to have clear roles, clear strengths, and clear counters," Bylos said. "'Thopters will always be incredibly important for crossing the desert, but they shouldn't be the dominant force in actual battles. We're planning to make more changes to the Deep Desert to accommodate ground battles and reinforce the use of player builds."</p><p dir="ltr">The Landsraad, another endgame system, is set to receive changes as well. Bylos acknowledged that the system "isn't exactly in the right place," and will be updated to provide more "micro rewards" for solo players and small groups. As many of the Landsraad tasks currently revolve around turning in large numbers of resources or crafted items, the current system rewards stockpiling materials ahead of time to turn in as soon as a task is revealed. Bylos said that isn't the intention behind the system and that Funcom will be looking to make changes "best we can."</p><p dir="ltr">Despite endgame complaints from PvE players since its June 5 "advanced access" launch, Dune: Awakening continues to be a big success on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1172710/Dune_Awakening/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Steam</a>. The sci-fi survival game recently reached a new concurrent-player record of 189,000 players, according to SteamDB. Alongside endgame changes, Funcom also announced Dune: Awakening has sold one million copies, making it the fastest-selling game in the studio's history.</p>

            <p>
Promising Minecraft-like sandbox adventure Hytale has been cancelled after a decade of development, and creator Hypixel Studios is "winding down" its operations.
</p>
<p>
Hytale began development in 2015, and was Hypixel's attempt at combining the mini-games found on its hugely popular eponymous Minecraft server - which has been visited by more than 18m visitors since its inception in 2013 - with its own RPG-like, Minecraft-style sandbox experience, built from the ground up. And there's been a lot of buzz around the project for a long time, with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/league-of-legends">League of Legends</a> developer Riot Games investing millions in Hytale prior to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/riot-games-snaps-up-studio-behind-promising-minecraft-like-sandbox-game-hytale">acquiring Hypixel in 2020</a>. But now the plug has been pulled.
</p>
<p>
Hypixel announced the "incredibly tough news" in a <a href="https://www.hytale.com/news/2025/6/a-difficult-update-about-hytale">lengthy statement on its website</a>. "This is not the outcome any of us - at Hypixel or at Riot - wanted," it wrote. "But after years of pushing forward, adapting, and exploring every possible path, it became clear we couldn't bring Hytale to life in a way that truly delivered on its promise."
</p>
<p>
"Game development is brutally hard - especially when you're trying to build something original that speaks to a creative, passionate community," it continued. "Over time, as our vision evolved and the genre matured around us, the bar kept rising. Our technical ambitions grew more complex, and even after a major reboot of the game engine, the team found that Hytale still wasn't as far along as it needed to be. It became clear we'd need a lot more time to get it to a place where it could support the ambitious vision for the game.
</p>
<p>
"We looked at reducing scope, adjusting timelines, and finding new angles to keep moving forward. But each of those options would have meant compromising on what made Hytale special in the first place. It wouldn't have been the game we set out to make. And it wouldn’t have been the game you deserve. This is a painful decision. We still believe in Hytale. We believe in the team, and are forever grateful to every member, past or present, who poured their love into the game. We're also incredibly proud of the work we did: the world we imagined, the risks we took, and the heart we poured into this project. None of that can be taken away. And just to clarify - this doesn't affect the Hypixel server on Minecraft. It's run separately from Hypixel Studios and will continue to operate as usual."
</p>
<p>
Hypixel's statement suggests it had attempted to "see if there were investors or acquirers who could continue to help carry Hytale forward", but with no more funding coming from Riot and the project now dead, employees - said to number "100+" on Hypixel's website - are being "supported with generous severance and resources to help them find what's next". Hypixel itself is "beginning the process of winding down... over the next few months".
</p>
<p>
"To our community: thank you," the statement concludes. "Your belief in Hytale kept us going through thick and thin... Even though we're closing this chapter, the spirit of Hytale and everything we hoped it could be will stay with us. We're proud of what we built, and we’ll carry those lessons forward into whatever comes next."

            <link>https://aftermath.site/partner-weird-oreos</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/i-love-my-partner-despite-the-weird-way-she-eats-oreos.1226208/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>In an age when some folks would rather <a href="https://youtu.be/cFRuiVw4pKs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">“marry” an AI</a>, I’m closing in on four years with my real-life partner: learning, growing, and trying to be mindful of how <a href="https://www.polygon.com/review/533198/split-fiction-review-pc-ps5-xbox" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">differently the world works from her point of view</a>. That is, until she casually revealed her fucked up high-society Oreo-consuming routine, and I had to drop all “wife guy” pretences and call her a weirdo.&nbsp;</p><p>For starters, my partner doesn’t eat normal Oreos, Double Stuf, More Stuf, or any of the other flavors that would make sense to have a preference for. No, she eats the lemon creme-flavored Oreo Thins. That's fine; whatever rocks your boat. In all seriousness, she explained it to me as a part of her <a href="https://embrace-autism.com/an-introduction-to-audhd/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">AuDHD</a> where, to her, the OG Oreo cookie tastes like “dirt, sand, and dry.” It could be worse; she could be the type of person I was in college, who would eat Oreos with soda instead of milk—a choice I’m paying for with my recent dentist visit. What’s got me cross isn’t the why, but the how of my partner’s Oreo eating habit. Here’s documentation of my partner's Oreo eating ritual:</p><h2>Step One: Twisting the cookie in half</h2><figure><figure></figure><figure></figure><span><figure></figure></span></figure><p>The least surprising part of my partner’s demonstration, which I immediately felt compelled to document because of its next step, involves her splitting the cookie in two. While doing so, she revealed that this step’s success rate, contrary to my reservations about its narrow margin for error, exponentially improves with the thin version of the cookie, as opposed to the original or Double Stuf options, due to the ratio of creme to cookie wafer.&nbsp;</p><p>“I do my best to evenly get all of the creme on one side and have an empty shell on the other,” she said, noticing how my face scrunched up when she referred to the halves of the cookies as “shells.”&nbsp;</p><h2>Step 2: Fancy feasting</h2><figure><figure></figure><figure></figure><span><figure></figure></span></figure><p>The next step in my partner’s process involves, as she puts it, “using the empty one like a little chip, dipping into the lemon creme.” However, that’s only one of the methods she uses. While this is her all but putting her pinky up and scraping creme off the cookie like it was a makeshift charcuterie board, method two sees her strip-mining the creme cookie chip until it's barren, using her teeth to make marks on it until all of the “stuf” is gone, and then eating the cookies straight out.&nbsp;</p><h2>But why?</h2><figure><figcaption><span>Isaiah Colbert</span></figcaption></figure><p>My partner doesn't know when her Oreo-eating ritual started. But she remembers eating them this way as a child, after getting the ick from eating them the pedestrian way. That includes a disdain for the dipping-in-milk process because she dislikes both when the Oreo gets soggy and when its crumbs sink to the bottom of the cup, i.e., the whole point of why folks do that.&nbsp;</p><p>“When they would always bring the Oreos out for all of us, all my cousins or whoever else would dip them in milk and eat them the regular way. I never liked that,” she said. “I thought the cookie was too thick. I thought it tasted like dirt.”&nbsp;</p><p>Why lemon-flavored Oreos? Well, she says she randomly saw them in the grocery store and realized they were better suited for her than the mainstream option. They had the right flavor profile and the perfect balance of cookie and creme to add to the thrill of “peeling it off perfectly.”&nbsp;</p><p>“It’s the perfect amount of cookie, the perfect amount of lemon creme. It’s not too much of either. These are my favorites,” she said.&nbsp;</p><p>Despite my teasing, her response to why she eats Oreos the way she does is beautiful.&nbsp;</p><p>“It's just a part of who I am,” she said after finishing off her cookie. “I've never really questioned it, I never thought it was weird, it’s just something I do.”</p><p>In writing this, her Oreo revelation doesn’t come as a surprise, considering the first time we went grocery shopping together. She sincerely asked me what I used my vanilla almond milk for, and was taken aback by my response, “To drink.” And yet, despite knowing some of her other quirks—like the time I watched in silent outrage as she scraped the frosting off her cake and lobbed it straight into the trash—I wasn’t fully prepared for her lore drop show-and-tell. At least now we’ve established a system: she gets her Oreos, and any rejected frosting is referred to me instead of being thrown away. Everyone wins.&nbsp;</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/dont-rank-cuomo-video-game"><h3>Experience The Joy Of Rejecting Andrew Cuomo Through A Video Game</h3></a><p>Robert Yang's latest browser game lets you, too, not rank Andrew Cuomo for NYC mayor</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/gamestop-trading-card-game-problems-scalpers"><h3>GameStop’s Expanding Trading Card Business Could Make A Tough Situation For Workers Worse</h3></a><p>“Unlike hardware, it has high margin potential,” GameStop CEO Ryan Cohen said to shareholders</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/siivagunner-youtube-channel-high-quality-rips"><h3>SiIvaGunner Is An Elaborate Game Music Joke Collective And One Of The Best Parts Of YouTube</h3></a><p>SiIvagunner started as YouTube elaborate in-joke about game music on YouTube and has evolved into a volunteer, Discord-managed democratic artist collective.</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div><br/><br/>https://aftermath.site/partner-weird-oreos]]></content:encoded>

More graphically impressive games on my PC cause extra heat to build up in my tiny home office. Consoles also spit out a shocking amount of hot air when you play games that push the hardware. The Xbox Series X, in particular, is very effective at expelling burning hot air at a rapid rate. This is very good for the console, of course. But it also means that I have a mini-jet engine cooking me alive. At least it’s quiet while I melt.<br></p><p>I spoke to some friends who are experiencing similar issues. Some of them are avoiding certain games on specific platforms right now because it’s too damn hot, and because running your AC all day is expensive and bad for the environment. I personally try to limit how often I run our apartment’s AC system, and if I can save some money and electricity by skipping some sessions of <em>Marvel Rivals,</em> that seems like a good trade-off.</p><p>And sure, as those folks on that once-popular show often said, “Winter is coming.” Well, first fall, <em>then </em>winter. The point is: Cooler and colder days are not too far away. But as these extreme shifts in weather and climate become more common and more extreme every year, I expect the summer months to become an even worse time to use electronics that produce tons of heat. </p><p>Of course, as things get worse, being able to play games comfortably will probably become one of my lower priorities behind things like finding water, staying cool, and fighting off roving bandits hunting down any resources they can find. Still, I’ll miss playing video games. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/it-s-too-hot-to-play-video-games-1847410462]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Rekindling the long-running debate about whether Call of Duty skins have well and truly gone off the deep end, Beavis and Butt-Head are heading to the game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Beavis and Butt-Head are perhaps the poster boys of the MTV generation and genuine 90s cartoon icons. Created by Mike Judge, Beavis and Butt-Head are two idiotic teen slackers who sit around grunting and giggling at rock music on MTV.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Call of Duty has form when it comes to 90s-themed skins, so perhaps we shouldn’t be surprised to see Beavis and Butt-Head finally get their moment in the shooter. But what is perhaps surprising is how their skins look, which is a jarring combination of the cartoon style fans know Beavis and Butt-Head for, but wearing MilSim outfits.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">Mike Judge’s Beavis &amp; Butt-Head are coming to Call of Duty Season 04 Reloaded 🔥 <a href="https://t.co/3QnIYMv2AN" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/3QnIYMv2AN</a></p>— Call of Duty (@CallofDuty) <a href="https://twitter.com/CallofDuty/status/1937194237554295005?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">June 23, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">“Of all the collabs to get military-themed outfits in this game, I definitely did not see Beavis and Butt-Head getting one,” <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/blackops6/comments/1limd1t/comment/mzd1p8m/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">said redditor RdJokr1993</a>. “Lol these are unironically more MilSim than most skins in the game,” added LoneRogue2018.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Others are coming up with on-brand one-liners we might hear Beavis and Butt-Head say in-game. For example: “Heh heh heh heh, he said 'Duty.'”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In truth, Beavis and Butt-Head shouldn’t come as any surprise to anyone who’s played Call of Duty in the last few years. This is a game that has the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, a Dragon Knight that looks straight out of Skyrim, and, more recently, a skin made from strips of bacon, all running around realistic, war-torn environments. Activision releases these sorts of skins and players complain about realism, but they sell enough for Activision to keep releasing these sorts of skins. And so the cycle continues.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The question will be how much Beavis and Butt-Head cost. Activision has come under fire recently for its ultra aggressive monetization of Black Ops 6 and Warzone, with some players complaining about the high price of bundles, the introduction of event passes, and ever more expensive battle passes. Earlier this month, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/activision-insists-heavily-criticized-call-of-duty-black-ops-6-and-warzone-ads-in-loadout-menus-were-a-test-published-in-error-strips-them-out-following-backlash">Activision pulled controversial adverts placed inside Black Ops 6 and Warzone loadouts</a>, insisting they were a “feature test” published “in error.” It’s worth remembering that Black Ops 6 is a premium, $70 game, and this year’s Black Ops 7 is set to jump to $80.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And will this Beavis and Butt-Head skin carry forward into the recently announced Black Ops 7? Activision has yet to say. But given the timing of its release, the hope is that anyone who forks out for Beavis and Butt-Head will get bang for their buck.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For now, Call of Duty players are speculating that getting a headshot against Beavis and Butt-Head might be a little easier than against other skins in the game. Is this a pay-to-lose bundle?</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">Good luck to those sitting on them headies… 💀 <a href="https://t.co/U4nd9l8PxS" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/U4nd9l8PxS</a></p>— Team WaR (@OfficialTeamWaR) <a href="https://twitter.com/OfficialTeamWaR/status/1937196728785993828?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">June 23, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">We don't know when the Season 4 Reloaded mid-season update is set to launch exactly, but based on how many days players have left to complete the Season 4 battle pass, it should be released on or around June 26.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/death-stranding/" data-ref-id="5000-451575">Death Stranding</a> was visually arresting when it launched on PS4, taking Guerrilla's Decima Engine and applying it in ways not explored by the studio's Horizon series. With the sequel, Kojima Productions has yet again delivered a game that pushes boundaries visually, with some key enhancements on some of the engine's improvements we've already seen in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/horizon-forbidden-west/" data-ref-id="5000-513799">Horizon Forbidden West</a>.</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach/" data-ref-id="5000-577622">Death Stranding 2</a> crams a lot of detail into its gorgeously sparse open world, with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-death-stranding-2-tech-review" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Digital Foundry</a> noting how high the image quality is and how far details stretch out before having to taper off to keep performance in check. It makes static images of Death Stranding 2 look pristine and almost life-like, with that illusion maintained in motion. Digital Foundry notes how impressive the various weather effects in the game are, with specific mention of how water physics have been improved on over Horizon's implementation to account for more dynamic behavior for gameplay purposes. You can watch the full technical breakdown below.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ApWCtAuKcI" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/-ApWCtAuKcI" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>In testing, Death Stranding 2 sticks to its two performance targets, staying locked to either 30 or 60 frames per second depending on the mode you chose on PS5 or PS5 Pro. Better yet, choosing performance mode on either console runs the game inside a 120Hz container on supported displays, offering more responsive inputs in tandem with the dependable performance.</p><p>Differences between Sony's two consoles aren't as stark as you might expect, with both aiming for 1440p outputs and using the Decima Engine's own approach to upscaling to 4K. Digital Foundry notes that this causes some image instability on the original PS5 where the image looks cleaner on the PS5 Pro, perhaps thanks to the more powerful console sticking closer to a native 1440p most of the time.</p><p>The bigger differences are between the Quality and Performance modes on PS5, which Digital Foundry notes have enough of a gulf between them that players might prefer the lower framerate albeit shaper quality mode. On PS5 Pro, the difference between the two is so imperceptible that the publication suggests just sticking with the Performance mode.</p><p>Death Stranding 2 is out soon for players who have ordered the game's Deluxe Edition, granting 48 hours early access before the game launches for everyone on 26 June. In GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/death-stranding-2-review-tied-up/1900-6418377/" data-ref-id="1900-6418377">Death Stranding 2 review</a>, writer Diego Nicolás Argüello notes that the sequel sticks too closely to its predecessor at times, writing, "This second iteration doesn't feel as arresting as it mired in familiar story beats, a disappointing lack of friction, and an obsession with doubling down on the weaker aspects of Death Stranding."</p>

To date, my <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dune-awakening">Dune: Awakening</a> experience has largely consisted of building an ungainly box and hanging from the ceiling in my underwear. But more driven players have already barrelled their way to the endgame, where its "extremely competitive" PvP focus has become something of a concern for PvE players. Enter developer Funcom, which reckons it might have found a solution.
</p>
<p>
Dune: Awakening's endgame, if you're unfamiliar, is focused on the Deep Desert. This vast, ever-shifting landscape is where players can venture in search of valuable resources and endgame gear as they make a grasp for factional supremacy, and one that's reset every week by Coriolis storms. It's also PvP-focused - a design decision <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dune-awakening-pvp-changes-next-update">Funcom has previously stood firm on</a>, even as Ornithopters <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dune-awakening-pvp-is-being-dominated-by-one-busted-technique-crushing-people-with-helicopters">rained down from above</a>. Now, though, Dune: Awakening creative director Joel Bylos has admitted the system isn't quite working in the way the team had hoped.
</p>
<p>
"We still believe in the core concept of the Deep Desert," he explained in a <a href="https://duneawakening.com/news/a-message-from-the-creative-director-on-pve-and-pvp/">newly shared developer blog</a>. "The tension of heading out there, head on a swivel, eyes peeled for foes as you enter the most dangerous part of the most dangerous planet in the universe. Our wish was that players would embrace this loop, forming guilds to work together to overcome the bleakness of the Deep Desert... The reality is that players are reporting being cut out of the endgame due to the extremely competitive nature of the Deep Desert.

<p>
This runs counter to the team's vision, according to Bylos. "We want PvE players to be able to play the endgame and have access to the content of the endgame. Our goal is not to force PvE players to interact with a PvP system that they may have no interest in."
</p>
<p>
As such, Funcom is introducing Partial Warfare (PvE) zones to the Deep Desert where players can explore testing stations and harvest T6 resources without being forced into conflict with other players. However, Landsraad control points, shipwrecks and the largest spice fields will remain War of Assassins (PvP) flagged. "The deepest parts of the Deep Desert," Bylos continued, "will remain as they currently are - high reward, high risk areas."
</p>
<p>
"The beauty of the Deep Desert design with weekly resets and renewals," he added, "is that we can iterate and experiment with different layouts and setups to really help us tune it. As we make changes we will send out surveys to help us capture your thoughts."
</p>
<p>
On top of that, Bylos acknowledged a variety of issues impacting PvP. Some of these relate to Ornithopters, which have <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dune-awakening-early-meta-helicopter-infested-nightmare">dominated Dune: Awakening's endgame</a> ever since players <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dune-awakening-patch-ends-the-reign-of-vehicular-terror-as-ramming-into-other-players-no-longer-deals-damage">realised they could drop them on other people's heads</a>. Scout Ornithopters will see a range of changes, which Funcom details in its blog, as will other mechanics the studio believes are being "abused", including respawn timers, vehicle storage tools, and hand scanners.
</p>
<p>
"The intended dynamic of Deep Desert PvP" Bylos noted, "is that - unless you really mess up - you always have the option to retreat in good order with whatever you've managed to claim so far. If you're smart and vigilant, you never <em>have to</em> fight if you don't want to. If you run, you'll have to call a halt to whatever task you were pursuing, but that should always be a choice. PvP should happen when both parties decide they want to fight over a location."
</p>
<p>
And finally, Bylos had a few words to say on Dune: Awakening's Landsraad design, admitting this endgame "framework" still has a number of "key flaws". Funcom is currently looking at addressing some of these, including the "inability to hand in items after a square is completed and the rapidity at which some squares are turned in", alongside stockpiling, which is currently being unintentionally rewarded. Additionally, the studio will be introducing Landsraad "micro rewards" for solo/small group players. 
</p>
<p>
"Once a live game launches, it becomes a collaborative effort between the developers and the players to make it something amazing," Bylos concluded. "We appreciate your feedback on what we hope is the beginning of a long journey together. Bear with us – our intention is to be clear and open in our communications and to make Dune: Awakening a game that everybody can enjoy." And by all accounts, Dune: Awakening - which we <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dune-awakening-review">gave four stars in our review</a> - currently has a lot of everybodys, what with having <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dune-awakening-worms-its-way-past-one-million-sales-funcoms-best-performing-game-to-date">already hurtled passed 1m sales</a>.

			<p>When you think of Cyberpunk 2077, the game's romances may not be the first thing that comes to mind, but they are still worth highlighting as possibly the best RPG romances, at least according to Fallout: New Vegas, Pillars of Eternity, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/pentiment/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Pentiment</a> creator Josh Sawyer. <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/rpg/pentiment-and-fallout-new-vegas-designer-josh-sawyer-isnt-usually-a-fan-of-rpg-romances-but-thinks-cyberpunk-2077-nailed-it-if-i-were-gonna-base-romances-on-anything-id-probably-do-something-like-that/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Speaking to PC Gamer</a>, Obsidian's Game Designer noted that the romances are well separated from everything else in Cyberpunk 2077, unlike in other RPGs, where the romantic conversations happen in the party's camp with everyone nearby.</p>
<p><em>The reason is because those relationships, whether you like the characters or not⁠—which I feel is kind of beside the point, from a design perspective⁠—it's not in a party context. [In other RPGs] there are six of us together, and we're engaging in these romantic talks right next to everyone, and it feels kind of odd.</em></p>
<p><em>[In Cyberpunk 2077] You do something with Judy, let's say, and then, you wrap it up, you have a convo, and then she's like, 'I gotta go do some things, bye. She is gone, and you're not going to hear from her until time has elapsed, and probably until you've progressed the critical path. There's a built-in pacing, so the development of the human component of that relationship is developed over content that is specifically made for the two of you, like it's content for you and Judy alone. River doesn't come into it at all. It's not to say that's flawless, but I really do enjoy that way of doing them. If I were gonna base romances on anything, I'd probably do something like that.</em></p>
<p><em>Some of it is production value, which, of course, Obsidian is not necessarily the big cutscene company. Larian does that extremely well. Of course, CDPR does that exceptionally well. BioWare also does it well.</em></p>
<p>Do you agree with Sawyer's praise of Cyberpunk 2077 romances? And what do you think about RPG romances as a whole? Let us know in the comments below.</p>

              <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p dir="ltr">Prior to attending <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/day-of-the-devs-summer-game-fest-edition-2025-everything-revealed/2900-6641/" data-ref-id="2900-6641">Summer Game Fest</a>, I had heard exceedingly little about Heart Machine's upcoming title, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/possessors/" data-ref-id="5000-631833">Possessor(s)</a>. Admittedly, this might be because I was a bit tapped out; for as big of a fan I was of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/hyper-light-drifter/" data-ref-id="5000-228161">Hyper Light Drifter</a>, the studio's newer releases--<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/solar-ash-review-ash-wins-day/1900-6417797/" data-ref-id="1900-6417797">Solar Ash</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hyper-light-breaker-update-brings-a-more-traditional-roguelike-experience/1100-6531151/" data-ref-id="1100-6531151">Hyper Light Breaker</a>--didn't capture me the same way Drifter's lush-yet-somber world did. It seemed to me that Heart Machine was building upon the parts of their legacy that I found less compelling, emphasizing fast, fluid traversal and breadth in exploration rather than depth. Don't get me wrong--I <em>liked </em>both Solar Ash and Hyper Light Breaker, but they didn't captivate me--and their trajectory made me unsure if a new Heart Machine title ever would. Fortunately, a brush with Possessor(s) has proven me <em>very </em>wrong.</p><p dir="ltr">Billed as a search-action game--a more game-neutral term to describe the metroidvania genre--Possessor(s) marks a shift to the second dimension for Heart Machine and combines fast-paced, side-scrolling action (a la Metroid) with Dark Souls-inspired mechanics to create a tense, brutal, and gorgeous adventure game that emphasizes continuous discovery. Whereas the studio has previously shipped titles with more abstract stories and characters that aren't particularly humanoid in appearance, Possessor(s) also seems to mark a pivot towards a more traditional version of storytelling, with hand-drawn, swoon-worthy characters that dish out plot beats and dialogue with accompanying character art, similarly to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/hades/" data-ref-id="5000-490217">Hades</a>.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4519275-copyofqas%2813%29.png" data-ref-id="1300-4519275" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4519275-copyofqas%2813%29.png" data-ref-id="1300-4519275"></a><figcaption>Rhem speaks to Luca.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4519275-copyofqas%2813%29.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">So far, this description contains <em>a lot</em> of comparisons to some incredibly beloved games, so I want to emphasize that despite this, in the section I played, I didn't find Possessor(s) to be overly derivative. Although it pulls inspiration from some of my favorite titles and I'd argue I didn't see anything that reinvents or refines its genres, its urban-horror setting, lustrous art direction, overall tone, and budding narrative feel both distinctly Heart Machine and like a new direction for the studio.</p><p dir="ltr">Set in a world being overtaken by dimension-hoping demons, Possessor(s) kicks off with main character Luca watching one of her loved ones get ripped apart by a demon while pinned under a pile of debris. Eventually, she is able to move out from underneath it, only to find both her legs have been severed from her body. After a few moments spent crawling and crying out for help, she finds it in the shape of a tall, dark, and handsome individual named Rhem--who also just so happens to be one of the demons terrorizing humanity. Rhem tells Luca he can graft her new legs and save her life, so long as she enters a pact with him that will help save his life, too. She reluctantly agrees, and the two form a unique bond that ties both their souls to Luca's body.</p><p dir="ltr">As the two proceed, Rhem alludes to Luca not understanding the demons' motives or the true purpose of a global corporation associated with household appliances and creating better living for its customers. This ultimately sets up a mystery for Luca to unravel, causes all the game's evil, inanimate object enemies to make a whole lot more sense, and creates a path forward for her and Rhem's coexistence. Although not entirely novel--science-fiction and corrupt corporations tend to go hand-in-hand--it's still an interesting premise made more compelling by its macabre leanings, fantastic character art, and the overall atmosphere of the decaying urban sprawl I explored.</p><p dir="ltr">Most importantly, however, Possessor(s)' gameplay feels great. It's fluid, fun, delightfully difficult, and, based on the portion of the map I saw, seems like it will offer up a large, dense world ripe for exploration. Though some metroidvanias (or search-action games) leave room for hack-and-slash style gameplay, Possessor(s) requires a level of dexterity and intention that reflects the team's desire to incorporate souls-like elements into it. It also includes "bonfires" and a world that resets once you rest, further emphasizing that influence.</p><p dir="ltr">Possessor(s) has already impressed me, and with its promises of a complex narrative that allows you to play through multiple paths and meet a variety of characters with their own "heartbreaking" stories, it has quickly become one of my most anticipated releases of 2025.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Ravensburger has new details on<em> Horrified: Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em>. This fifth entry in the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/horrified-american-monsters-board-game-review" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Horrified</em></a> board game series will feature iconic monsters, character classes, and puzzle mechanics from the world's most popular fantasy TTRPG.</p>

<h2>The <em>Horrified: Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> Preview</h2>

<p>&nbsp;As the name implies, <em>Horrified: Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> will take players on an adventure through the Forgotten Realms. On this journey, players will take on at least two of four monsters drawn from the fantasy TTRPG's fifty years of lore.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/horrified-dungeons-dragons-game-board.jpg?itok=oss3yY3U 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/horrified-dungeons-dragons-game-board.jpg?itok=cIs7CUzX 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Those four monsters are the stuff of both legends and total party wipes. The Mimic, the killer treasure chest that feeds on foolish or greedy treasure hunters. The (non-<a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/wizkids-announces-official-dungeons-dragons-potato-head-beholder-miniature-coming-to" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Potato Head</a>) Beholder, the multi-eyed bringer of death and doom. The Displacer Beast, the ferocious feline with the power to cast illusions. Lastly, there is the Red Dragon, the most prideful and destructive of the chromatic dragons.</p>

<p>You can't just fight the monsters in <em>Horrified: Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em>. Each one has a puzzle that must be solved before you can test your mettle against them. For example, the Red Dragon's puzzle involves finding its prized Orb of Dragonkind and luring it to its hoard.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/dungeons-dragons" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em></a> influences don't stop at the monsters. Each player can choose to play as one of five heroes: the Wizard, Rogue, Fighter, Cleric, or Bard. Each hero has their own unique set of abilities that can aid the group in their journey. Those special abilities are determined by rolling the most iconic of TTRPG dice: the d20.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;“With the assets provided by Hasbro and Wizards of the Coast, we got to see and read through the expansiveness of the worldbuilding; in many ways, our biggest challenge was deciding what we wanted to show,” said Sam Dawson, Art Director at Ravensburger. “Then, of course, we had to decide how to interpret that for the board and fill in the seams where no definitive visual exists.&nbsp; I think the result will both feel like familiar territory to fans alongside some new interpretations of the Undermountain they know and love.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>If you are interested in how <em>Horrified: Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> plays, there is an opportunity to see it in action. The game will be featured in the latest episode of Critical Role's "Everything is Content" show, which will debut on Twitch on June 24th at 10 PM ET.</p>

<p><em>Horrified: Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> will launch worldwide on August 1.</p>
