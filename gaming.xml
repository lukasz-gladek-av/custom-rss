It was, in my opinion, the best alternative if you weren’t keen on splashing out on Nintendo’s own <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2-pro-controller-a-new-benchmark-in-comfort-and-design">Pro Controller</a>.</p>
<p>Until now, that is. Gulikit made headlines <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/gulikits-elves-2-is-the-first-third-party-pad-with-switch-2-wake-up-support">in 2025</a> by introducing the first third-party controller with wake-up support for Switch 2.

<p>With the TT Pro / TT Max pads, however, Gulikit has created its best controllers yet at $59.99 / £59.99 and $69.99 / $69.99 respectively; two that, in my opinion, just edge out 8BitDo’s Pro 3 as the strongest third-party offering for Switch 2 so far.</p>

<p>One glance at the Pro or Max — I'm covering both here — and you’d be forgiven for thinking, 'But this is just an Xbox controller!' And yes, Gulikit has been leaning heavily on Microsoft’s design for a while now, so the overall shape is much the same. Putting it side-by-side with an official Xbox pad reveals that the Pro/Max is slightly lengthier, but otherwise you’d be hard pressed to find much difference with the form factor.</p>
<p>What <em>is</em> different, however, is the D-pad placement, which has been swapped with the left analogue stick for a more symmetrical design akin to the PlayStation DualSense (and, fortuitously for comparison's sake, the Pro 3). Whether this is a good thing or not really depends on personal preference, but I like it. Having the D-pad up high makes the Pro/Max a wonderful choice for both fighting and retro games, but if you do want to use it for 3D titles with both analogue sticks, this still feels really good.</p>
<p>The D-pad includes two floating designs that you can swap out on the fly. One is more traditional, with a cross on its face, while the other is basically just a concave disc. When I saw the latter in promotional images, I feared the worst, but it’s actually my go-to option. You can still feel the tactile response from the eight directional inputs, and it just feels really nice to waggle about. Overall, the D-pad is responsive and satisfying to use, while lacking the annoying ‘clicking’ sound of the Pro 3.</p>

<p>The analogue sticks feel great, too, and the TMR tech <em>should</em> keep dreaded stick drift at bay for many years to come. Gulikit has also included RGB lighting around both sticks if you’re into that kind of thing, and you can change this via the controller itself to display a basic blue, a rainbow multi-coloured effect, or have it light up depending on the direction you’re moving the sticks. If you don’t want any of this, you can turn it off entirely.</p>
<p>This is also where the Pro and Max differ the most. The latter contains an extra four stick caps of varying heights. In my time testing the controllers, I didn’t really come across any scenarios in which a lengthier stick cap proved necessary, but it’s nice that these are included.</p>
<p>The Max also includes the option to swap between four and eight-directional inputs on the D-pad, while the ‘Auto-Pilot Gaming’ (APG) functionality — which lets you record and play back specific input combos — includes longer time options.</p>
<p>The ABXY buttons all feel exactly as you’d expect, though like the D-pad, these are generally a bit quieter than the Pro 3. If you fancy using the Pro/Max on PC, you can also swap out the buttons for the standard Xbox layout using the included tweezers. Spacing is slightly closer than what you’d see on Nintendo's official Pro Controller and the Pro 3, so everything is easily within reach, while the convex shape of the buttons themselves feels pleasant enough.</p>

<p>Up on top, you’ve got Xbox-inspired triggers, and just like the Pro 3, you can toggle between micro-switch inputs and pressure-sensitive Hall Effect inputs with the relevant switches over on the back. Both options feel great, and I found I’ve been swapping between the two depending on what game I’m playing. So I’d have the full Hall Effect triggers activated for something like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a>, while the micro-switches feel better on more retro offerings like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/super_metroid">Super Metroid</a>. To be clear, Mario Kart doesn't make use of analogue triggers; they just feel more natural to me in modern games.</p>
<p>Both pads come with additional paddles that you can add into the four slots on the back. These are nearly identical to what you’d find on the Xbox Elite Controller, and so they’re designed in a way that your two middle fingers rest comfortably on them without accidentally pressing them in.</p>
<p>Again, mapping inputs to these is all done via the controller itself by utilising the settings button in the centre of the device. Gulikit includes a manual for any settings you might want to fiddle around with, and it’s much preferable to loading up an app. If you’re not keen on having the paddles, then the controllers still feel comfortable without them.</p>

<p>In addition to all the bells and whistles you’d expect to find, the Pro and Max have a plethora of additional options. I mentioned a few already, but you’ve also got a range of rumble settings depending on how much feedback you want. I can’t stress enough just how good the rumble really is; it’s just a hair away from being on par with the official Pro Controller 2.</p>
<p>You can also adjust gyro sensitivity, dead zones, and more, and there's a capture button for snapping those sweet Mario Kart World wins. In terms of exclusions, it lacks a headphone jack, NFC amiibo support, and a dedicated chat button. I don’t personally consider any of these essentials, but you may feel different.</p>
<p>Gulikit states wireless latency of 2.62ms with a 730Hz polling rate (the frequency at which data is sent from the controller to the console), while plugging the controllers in reduces this even further to 2.16ms. I've found them to be remarkably responsive in practice.</p>
<p>The retail models also come bundled with Gulikit's own <a href="https://www.gulikit.com/productinfo/1534859.html">Hyperlink 2 Adapter</a>, so if you want to go Bluetooth wireless while eliminating the possibility of interference from elsewhere, that's an option too with a quoted polling rate of 820hz at 2.95ms (and if you <em>really</em> want to, you can use the adapter to link up a PS5 Dualsense to the Switch 2 – wild stuff).</p>
<p>Meanwhile, I’ve used the Max specifically almost every day for over a month and only needed to recharge it once. Gulikit claims between 14 - 26 hours between charges depending on settings, and that sounds about right; it easily lasted for longer than 20 hours or so in practice. It’s head and shoulders above most competition, then, and is perhaps second only to Nintendo's Pro Controller.</p>

<p>So overall, the TT Pro and Max are absolute beasts. Not only do they have wake-up support for Switch 2, but they're easily two of the most comfortable controllers I've ever grasped in my grubby mitts. The D-pad placement works nicely for me, but I could certainly understand if you prefer the offset approach. And with the TMR sticks, Hall Effect triggers, RGB lighting, and loads of settings to fiddle around with, Gulikit has provided almost everything you could reasonably want or need from a third-party pad.</p>
<p>Most folks will be quite happy with the Pro model here, with only a minority finding genuine use for the additional stick caps found in the Max. Heck, at $70 though, the Max provides pretty much everything you'd find in Xbox's own Elite Controller at more than half the price. It's insane value for money, and in my opinion, the best third-party controller for Switch 2 so far.</p>
<p>Now, if companies could stop using the word 'Pro' to name their controllers, that'd be <em>great</em>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Digital Foundry Confirms Monster Hunter Wilds PC Performs ‘Thousands’ of DLC Checks That Hurt Performance, But Only in Certain Conditions]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-wilds-pc-thousands-dlc-checks-only-certain-conditions/</link>
            <guid>1408549</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Yesterday, we <a href="https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-wilds-performance-can-reportedly-double-removing-dlc-check/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reported</a> that one of the reasons <strong>Monster Hunter Wilds PC</strong> players may encounter unexpected frame rate drops is that the game checks for DLC ownership, and <strong>the less DLC you own, the worse the frame rate is going to be.</strong> That can be a problem, especially since there are dozens of cosmetic DLCs. Thankfully, after modder de_Tylmarande found this out, a fix was quickly deployed by Nexus Mods user Vaeux <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/monsterhunterwilds/mods/3798?tab=description" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">with the so-called '<strong>Less DLC Checks</strong>' mod</a>. The mod requires praydog's <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-rise-modding-tool-reframework-updated-to-work-with-sunbreak-expansion/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">REFramework</a></strong>, which improves and fixes various issues in <strong>CAPCOM</strong>'s games built with the <strong>RE Engine</strong>.</p>



<p>Now, Digital Foundry <a href="https://www.digitalfoundry.net/news/2026/01/the-latest-monster-hunter-wilds-pc-perf-drama-explained" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">has investigated the issue</a> and discovered that the user's computer is indeed being hammered by <strong>'thousands' of DLC checks</strong>, which are lowering the frame rate. However, <strong>this only happens in a specific scenario</strong>: when your character is in a hub zone and one of the Support Desk felyne characters is nearby. That's because those NPCs handle the DLC menu.</p>



<p>Still, the modder's claim under said conditions is perfectly valid. Using a <strong>Ryzen 5 3600 CPU</strong> test system, the testing performed by Digital Foundry's Richard Leadbetter discovered that the performance boost granted by the Less DLC Checks mod got higher when the graphics settings were lowered:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Maxed settings (1440p ultra, RT, DLSS balanced):</strong>&nbsp;11.4% performance improvement</li>



<li><strong>High settings with RT:</strong>&nbsp;20% performance improvement</li>



<li><strong>Lowest settings (DLSS ultra performance, no RT):</strong>&nbsp;25.6% performance improvement</li>
</ul>



<p>The good news is that this issue only really affects the Monster Hunter Wilds PC performance in the aforementioned conditions. That said, CAPCOM should absolutely fix it as soon as possible, and in a way, it's wild that a user discovered it almost a year after the game's original release.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Nintendo Could Learn Something From This Incredible 3D Platformer]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/nintendo-could-learn-something-from-this-incredible-3d-platformer-2000660289</link>
            <guid>1408543</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>One of the most important aspects for a 3D platformer to nail is making sure it feels amazing. Running around, jumping, climbing, diving, all of it should be a joy. You should be able to run and jump in a mostly empty room with no textures or music and still have a good time. And </span><i><span>Big Hops</span></i><span>, out now on PS5, PC, and Switch, is a new 3D indie platformer that succeeds perfectly at providing a platformer that’s incredible to play while also offering up plenty of ways to experiment and explore.</span></p> <p><span>In </span><i><span>Big Hops</span></i><span>, you play as the young, precious, and very agile Hop, a talking frog with dreams of leaving his forest to see more of the world. While out with his younger sister on a hike through the woods, which serves as the game’s short and not-annoying tutorial, Hop is summoned by a mysterious voice into a strange dimension. From there, he goes on an epic journey across three different worlds to find the pieces needed to get back home. The eight hours that followed were some of the best 3D platforming I’ve played in a long, long time.</span></p>

 <h2><b>Tongue Tied</b></h2> <p><span>Like most main characters from platforming games, Hop can, well…hop, roll, dive, climb, and eventually swim. But Hop has something special that Mario, Ratchet, and beloved icon Bubsy lack: A handy, dandy, and very long tongue. And it’s Hop’s tongue that elevates </span><i><span>Big Hops </span></i><span>from a great platformer to an all-time classic.</span></p>

 <p><span>With his trusty tongue, Hop can grapple and swing to new locations like Spider-Man. He can also use his tongue to open chests, flip levers, collect items, and even unlock doors via one of the strangest lock-picking mini-games I’ve ever seen. The tongue in </span><i><span>Big Hops</span></i><span> is implemented so well that using it just became second nature to me, as natural as jumping or running in any other game.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>That’s not to say the tongue in</span><i><span> Big Hops </span></i><span>isn’t very cool and awesome, because it is, and the developers designed a lot of clever puzzles and platforming segments that take advantage of it. But it never feels</span> <span>like a silly slapped-on gimmick or a worthless ability that you have to be reminded of via constant screen prompts.</span></p>

 <p><span>And yet, as cool a feature as it is, the devs don’t rely solely on Hop’s tongue to add variety to each of the massive semi-open worlds you explore over the course of </span><i><span>Big Hops’</span></i><span> runtime.</span></p>  <h2><b>Experimenting With Freaky Fruits</b></h2> <p><span>As you meet the locals in these places, which include pirate otters and punk rock bats, you’ll find various fruits that have all sorts of effects. One fruit, for example, when thrown against a wall, generates a rope bridge. Another fruit sets things on fire.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>My favorite special fruit is a green apple that sticks to nearly any surface and can be used to create permanent grapple points. All of these fruits offer a lot of creativity and let me pull off maneuvers that felt like cheating. Wildly,</span><i><span> Big Hops</span></i><span> lets you hold a few of these fruits in your expandable backpack, meaning you can take them to areas where maybe the developer didn’t plan on you having a fire fruit or trampoline fruit. It feels risky as heck to offer the player so much freedom, yet I’m not complaining.</span></p>

 <p><span>Combined, the fruits and tongue let me pull off some wild shit in this colorful 3D platformer. I was able to skip some sections of a level here or avoid a puzzle there using a combination of </span><i><span>Big Hops’</span></i><span> tongue swinging and fruit storing. And it’s this focus on rewarding and encouraging experimentation and exploration that really stood out to me. There were countless times in my journey to get Hop back home when I used my tongue and a fruit to get somewhere that I thought was out of bounds, but hiding up in a corner were a few coins or other small collectibles, a little hat tip from the makers of the game for trying something weird and pulling it off.</span></p> <div>           <ul>                           <li>                 <p>Back-of-the-box quote:</p>                 <p>“Hop does what Mario won’t: Licking everything useful he sees.”</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Developer</p>                 <p>Luckshot Games</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Type of game:</p>                 <p>Third-person 3D platformer</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Liked:</p>                 <p>Wonderful visuals,  awesome controls, unique tongue features, music</p>               </li>                               </ul><ul>                                         <li>                 <p>Disliked:</p>                 <p>Some performance issues, a few glitches</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Platforms:</p>                 <p>Switch, Switch 2, PC, PS5 (Played on PS5 Pro) </p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Played:</p>                 <p>Completed the main story and some side content in about 8 hours</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Release Date</p>                 <p>January 12, 2026</p>               </li>                                     </ul>         </div>  <p><span>Exploring and poking around levels is a joy in </span><i><span>Big Hops,</span></i><span> not only because the devs clearly want you to do that, but because each area and level is gorgeous, featuring cel-shaded-like visuals and crisp colors. On PS5, the game looks stunning and runs at a mostly locked 60FPS that helps the platforming feel snappy, fast, and fluid.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>The creepy, purple-tinted Void sections of the game are a standout, featuring stylish environments that twist and fold around in impossible ways. Oh, and the music is wonderful, too, evoking the same vibes as you’d expect from a classic platformer from the PS1 or N64 era.</span></p>

 <h2><b>No Fighting, Just Jumping</b></h2> <p><span>If you’re wondering what combat feels like or what kind of enemies Hop has to deal with, well, there’s none of that in </span><i><span>Big Hops.</span></i><span> Technically, there are a few bugs that will chase Hop (and many more that he can eat for a stamina boost) as well as a handful of fairly easy boss fights. But outside of that, 90 percent of </span><i><span>Big Hops</span></i><span> is combat-free and focused entirely on platforming, exploring, and puzzle-solving.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Don’t expect a relaxing or completely cozy adventure, though, as </span><i><span>Big Hops</span></i><span> has some tense and fast-paced platforming challenges, especially in the second half of the game. You just won’t have to squash 300 random enemies along the way.</span></p>

 <p><i><span>Big Hops</span></i><span> is exactly what I want out of a modern 3D platformer. It takes advantage of what modern games can do, with massive levels, detailed graphics, and lots of well-performed voice acting, while also remembering that the main reason people play these kinds of games is to have fun hopping between platforms and obstacles, to feel the satisfaction of getting better with each level and conquering new, trickier jumping challenges.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><i><span>Big Hops</span></i><span> delivers that experience and more via a visually varied journey that rewards you for poking at the edges of each level while using the game’s brilliant tongue mechanic to find different ways to succeed. Nintendo designers should play </span><i><span>Big Hops</span></i><span> and learn some valuable lessons from this very special game.</span></p>

            <title><![CDATA[EXCLUSIVE: WWE 2K26 Adding Four New Match Types]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/wwe-2k26-new-match-types/</link>
            <guid>1408540</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>WWE 2K26 is just about two months away, and players will have some new matches to enjoy when they load up the game.</p>



<p>In addition to learning that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/wwe-2k26-cm-punk-showcase-mode/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CM Punk will be the feature superstar</a> in the game’s Showcase mode, sources have told Insider Gaming what to expect from match types this year.</p>







<h2 id="h-what-are-the-new-wwe-2k26-match-types">What Are The New WWE 2K26 Match Types?</h2>



<p>In total, there are four new match types coming to this year’s. One of which, Insider Gaming understands, has been in the works for quiet some time.</p>



<p>The first new type is the I Quit match. This match hasn’t been seen since WWE 2K14, but is making a return after 13 years (the game launched in October 2013). </p>



<p>Another match returning after 13 years is the Inferno Match. In it, players can win by setting their opponent on fire. As you do heavier moves, the flames will get larger. The last returning match is the 3 Stages of Hell. A match type that hasn’t been seen since the days of Smackdown vs. Raw, this match type has players select three different stipulations for a 2-out-of-3 falls match.</p>







<p>As far as the new match coming to the game, the Dumpster Match is making its debut in the WWE 2K series. While it’s unsure, at this point, exactly how it’ll work, it’s possible that it’ll be akin to the casket match. Exact details on the match are expected to come in the coming weeks. </p>



<p>As far as a match type that debuted last year, Intergender Matches are returning to the game. It’s also been said that they will even be a part of MyFACTION.</p>

                <p>There are few things more important in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/hytale/" data-ref-id="5000-507834">Hytale</a> than the armor your character equips. Armor can save you from dying to a dangerous mob when you're exploring at night or in a dark cave. It also plays a large part in how your character looks, which does play a factor in your experience if you play in third person. While you might have already figured out how to craft the most basic armor in Hytale, there are several more advanced options that offer stronger protection from mobs.</p><p>The guide below shows you all of the current crafting recipes we have for armor in Hytale. As a note, some armor that you see in a Creative-mode world might not be available in Survival yet, similar to our guide on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/all-hytale-weapons-and-how-to-craft-and-upgrade-them/1100-6537414/" data-ref-id="1100-6537414">all Hytale weapons</a>.</p><h2 id="How_to_craft_armor_in_Hytale">How to craft armor in Hytale</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4636165-3a0ea143fb281f0a8e3f8863d5d19d8d.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4636165" data-ratio="0.53521126760563" data-width="2556" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4636165-3a0ea143fb281f0a8e3f8863d5d19d8d.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4636165"></a><figcaption>A character donning some rare armor in Hytale</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4636165-3a0ea143fb281f0a8e3f8863d5d19d8d.jpg"></figure><p>If you view your character from the inventory screen in Hytale, you'll see that you have four available slots to equip armor. These slots are for your Helm, Gauntlets, Cuirass, and Greaves. For some reason, there is no dedicated boot slot, but maybe that will be added in a future update. You also have a slot for a shield, but that's not necessarily armor, so we won't be covering those crafting recipes.</p><p>Before you rush into trying to craft armor, though, you'll need the right Workbench. All armor can be crafted at an Armorer's Workbench, but some higher-tier armor requires a tier two or tier three Armorer's Workbench. You can find out <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/all-workbench-crafting-recipes-in-hytale/1100-6537409/" data-ref-id="1100-6537409">how build the Armorer's Workbench</a> and upgrade it to higher tiers in our previous guide.</p><h2 id="All_armor_crafting_recipes_in_Hytale">All armor crafting recipes in Hytale</h2><p>You can find every single crafting recipe for all types of armor in Hytale.

Right now, it's essentially the same as the weapons system, as every weapon category has six options, as well. Perhaps future updates will start to include some of the ultra-rare armor and weapons that we can currently see and equip in Creative, but this is what we have available in Survival at the start of early access in Hytale.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Games Journalism Layoffs Hit Inverse, The Verge]]></title>
            <link>https://aftermath.site/layoff-verge-inverse-gaming/</link>
            <guid>1408525</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
      <p>Well, it wouldn't be a new year if there weren't a fresh hell--today, writers at the gaming section of Bustle Digital Group's Inverse said the section has been closed, and layoffs affected Vox-owned The Verge's gaming coverage as well.</p><p>According to a former Inverse writer, the closure affects three writers and the site's gaming editor. That editor, Shannon Liao, confirmed the news on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/shannonliao.bsky.social/post/3mcki3gpiy22o?ref=aftermath.site" rel="noreferrer">Bluesky</a>, alongside others. (Liao previously worked with Aftermath co-founder Nathan and me at The Washington Post's gaming vertical Launcher, which was shut down in 2023.) The former writer told Aftermath they were told in a Zoom call that the company is "'divesting' from gaming content," language echoed by other laid-off writers on social media today. <strong>(Update, 1/16/26, 1:27pm--</strong>One Inverse worker has <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/theloniusly.bsky.social/post/3mckkyivg4c2x?ref=aftermath.site" rel="noreferrer">said</a> they still have a job at the site, though their role will "be changing significantly."<strong>)</strong></p><p>They say this leaves Inverse with a "skeleton crew Entertainment Team." Bustle bought Inverse in 2019, which <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/bustle-digital-group-acquires-inverse-staffers-laid-off-2019-7?ref=aftermath.site" rel="noreferrer">included layoffs</a>; since then, BDG has seen a rash of layoffs so extensive that opening tabs about them is threatening to crash my browser, including in <a href="https://variety.com/2020/digital/news/the-outline-shut-down-joshua-topolsky-layoffs-bustle-1234570276/?ref=aftermath.site" rel="noreferrer">2020</a>, <a href="https://x.com/thefineprintnyc/status/1571958588326780936?s=20&amp;ref=aftermath.site" rel="noreferrer">2022</a>, <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/inverse-lays-off-staff?ref=aftermath.site" rel="noreferrer">2023</a>, and <a href="https://laid0ff.substack.com/p/negotiating-severance?ref=aftermath.site" rel="noreferrer">2024</a>, several of which affected Inverse specifically. BDG briefly revived Gawker, sister site of Aftermath's founders' previous home Kotaku, in 2021, and then shuttered it in <a href="https://variety.com/2023/digital/news/gawker-shutting-down-1235509262/?ref=aftermath.site" rel="noreferrer">2023</a>. BDG owner Bryan Goldberg, meanwhile, <a href="https://aftermath.site/ceo-of-media-company-who-owns-napoleons-hat-reviews-napoleon-movie-for-website-he-also-owns/" rel="noreferrer">owns a silly hat</a>.</p><p>"Management had been really telling us the last few months that numbers have been rebounding," the former writer told Aftermath. "But Inverse has always kind of been the black sheep of BDG, because we were so different from all of their other brands. Personally, I've always gotten&nbsp;the sense they just didn't really know what to do with us, despite our numbers justifying our existence."</p><p>In other bad news, Vox-owned The Verge's gaming writer Ash Parrish announced on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/adashtra.bsky.social/post/3mckkus43js22?ref=aftermath.site" rel="noreferrer">social media</a> that she'd been laid off today. (Parrish previously worked with Aftermath's co-founders at Kotaku.) Last May, Vox sold its <a href="https://aftermath.site/polygon-layoffs-sale/" rel="noreferrer">gaming site Polygon</a> to <a href="https://aftermath.site/tag/valnet/" rel="noreferrer">Valnet</a>. Vox also had rounds of layoffs in <a href="https://www.thewrap.com/vox-media-third-round-layoffs-in-two-months/?ref=aftermath.site" rel="noreferrer">2024</a> and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DND2aSmsR2c/?hl=en&amp;ref=aftermath.site" rel="noreferrer">2025</a>. </p><p>That media owners don't know what to do with their gaming coverage is nothing new, but seeing them continue to flail around, impacting the lives of writers in the process, is both heartbreaking and embarrassing. That we're so early in the new year feels like a sign we're in for another <a href="https://pressgazette.co.uk/publishers/journalism-job-cuts-2025-tracked/?ref=aftermath.site" rel="noreferrer">rough year</a> for journalism, though I'd love to be proven wrong. </p>

<p>Originally founded in 2008 by ex Retro Studios developers Mark Pacini, Todd Keller, and Jack Mathews, Armature has primarily worked on ports, starting with the PS Vita version of <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/psvita/metal_gear_solid_hd_collection">Metal Gear Solid HD Collection</a>.</p>
<p>It soon ventured into the world of VR and was acquired by Meta Platforms in 2022, a company that, at the time, were very keen to put all of its efforts into the metaverse. Now that tech bros around the world are obsessed with AI, Mark Zuckerberg has seen fit to steer away from VR.</p>
<p>The result is the closure of three key VR studios: the aforementioned Armature Studio alongside both Twisted Pixel Games and Sanzaru Games. Overall, around 10% of Meta's Reality Labs division has been laid off.</p>
<p>We sincerely hope the folks at every studio affected find their feet in due course. Heck, maybe Retro Studios can snap up Pacini, Keller, and Matthews again..? We'll have to wait and see.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/co-lead-desinger-on-skyrim-wouldve-made-the-elder-scrolls-vi-to-be-like-the-empire-strikes-back-if-he-was-in-charge/</link>
            <guid>1408510</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p><strong>Kurt Kuhlmann</strong> worked at <strong>Bethesda Game Studios</strong> as a designer for two decades, during which time he was the co-lead designer on <strong><a href="http://wccftech.com/review/skyrim-special-edition-review-when-some-polish-is-not-enough/">The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim</a></strong>, a game that could potentially go down in history as the studio's biggest hit ever. He was also known as the series "<em>loremaster</em>," and though he's no longer with Bethesda, in an interview with <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/the-elder-scrolls/bethesdas-former-elder-scrolls-loremaster-on-why-he-left-starfields-communication-breakdowns-and-how-he-wanted-the-elder-scrolls-6-to-be-the-empire-strikes-back/">PC Gamer</a>, Kuhlmann claims he was in line to lead up <strong>The Elder Scrolls VI</strong>, and if he had it his way, we'd be looking at a major <strong>Star Wars</strong>-inspired style of game for the long-awaited entry in the Elder Scrolls series.</p>



<p>Kuhlmann was never officially offered the job of lead designer on The Elder Scrolls VI, but according to him, Bethesda boss <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/ai-can-speed-up-game-development-human-intention-is-what-makes-our-stuff-special/">Todd Howard</a></strong> had verbally offered him the role following the completion of Skyrim. In fact, according to Kuhlmann, if not for <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/fallout-76-wearisome-wasteland-wandering/">Fallout 76</a></strong> and <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/starfield-the-elder-space-scrolls/">Starfield</a></strong>, we would've gotten The Elder Scrolls VI a lot sooner.</p>



<p>"<em>Of course, after <strong>Fallout 4</strong> we didn't go to TES6, we made Fallout 76, and then even then we didn't make TES6, we made Starfield," </em>said Kuhlmann<em>, "which became this extremely long project compared to other ones. So from my point of view, I've been waiting like 11 years to be the lead on TES6</em>."</p>



<p>"<em>I was obviously one of the old-timers there and had a lot of experience. <strong>Bruce [Nesmith]</strong> and I had been the co-leads on Skyrim</em>," Kuhlmann continued, "<em>I think most people would call it a successful project, so I thought that it wasn't unreasonable for me to think that I could be a successful lead on TES6. It wasn't just my expectation—I had been told that that was going to happen</em>. <em>And they made the decision, no, you're not going to be the lead.</em>"</p>



<p>Not being given the lead was what stamped home the reality for Kuhlmann that "<em>what I wanted and what he wanted were different at that point</em>," when it finally came to pass that the studio would focus on The Elder Scrolls VI. That, alongside the fact that Bethesda had grown to a point where it functioned in a way that wasn't compatible with how he preferred to operate, contributed to his leaving in 2023.</p>



<p>But if he had been given the lead, and if he had it his way? The story we would've gotten in his version of the game would've been the "<em>Empire Strikes Back</em>" moment for The Elder Scrolls. </p>



<p>"<em>I had in my mind that TES6 was going to be like The Empire Strikes Back</em>," said Kuhlmann. By the end of it, the Thalmor, the elven supremacists who were on the fringes of Skyrim's story, would've seemed to have won, save for the player doing something at the very end of the story to leave a hopeful, cliffhanger ending that would lead into The Elder Scrolls VII. "<em>So you've preserved hope for the future, but overall it looks like the Thalmor are on the march</em>."</p>



<p>Kuhlmann admits that he doesn't believe his idea would've gone far with the rest of the team. Making a game is not like making a movie. After waiting more than a decade for The Elder Scrolls VI, if it ended with evil winning, and a cliffhanger for good potentially succeeding in the next game, which could very well be another decade away, players might not have appreciated it as much as Kuhlmann. "<em>That's not a good way to end a game and say, yeah, we'll see you in 10, 15 years</em>," Kuhlmann said.</p>



<p>Still, it's interesting to hear Kuhlmann's side of the story, and to hear a little more insight into The Elder Scrolls VI, which we've not seen hide nor hair of <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-elder-scrolls-vi-starfield-announced/">since its far-too-early reveal back in <strong>2018</strong></a>. Now that Starfield is out of the way, at least we know the studio is working on it, as Todd Howard and other Bethesda executives <a href="https://wccftech.com/bethesda-speaks-on-the-elder-scrolls-vi-development-can-confirm-its-going/">can say nothing more than "<em>it's going</em>"</a> and that <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-elder-scrolls-vi-still-a-long-way-off-says-todd-howard/">the game is still "<em>a long way off</em>"</a> when it comes to the game's development progress.</p>



<p>And while Kuhlmann may be right that players wouldn't have loved his Empire Strikes Back, the reality is that no matter what Bethesda does, it won't be able to live up to expectations, as former Bethesda artist <a href="https://wccftech.com/how-do-you-beat-that-why-the-elder-scrolls-vi-is-in-a-no-win-situation/"><strong>Nate Purkeypile</strong> rightly calls the game a "<em>no-win</em>" situation</a>. </p>

              <p><span>The ongoing battle between </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/how-cory-in-the-house-ds-went-from-bad-forgotten-game-1842525482"><i><span>Cory in the House</span></i></a><span> and </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-rpg-review-in-progress-1851777402"><i><span>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</span></i></a><span> to decide which will ultimately be crowned the top user-rated game on Metacritic rages on, but an unforeseen consequence of the conflict is that secondhand copies of the Nintendo DS Disney game are skyrocketing in price in online marketplaces.</span></p> <p><span>As </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/clair-obscur-metacritic-cory-in-the-house-ds-game-2000659380"><i><span>Kotaku</span></i><span> first reported on Tuesday</span></a><span>, something strange was brewing over on Reddit: a seemingly organic campaign to get the long-memed 2008 Nintendo DS game </span><i><span>Cory in the House</span></i><span> to the top of Metacritic’s user-rated rankings, unseating 2025’s Game of the Year. </span><span>When I originally reported on the story, </span><i><span>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</span></i><span>, the current top-ranked user-rated game on the platform, had just dipped from a 9.6 to a 9.5. </span><i><span>Cory in the House </span></i><span>had just risen from 9.3 to 9.4. The meme was about to become a reality.</span></p>

 <p><span>Since then, things have simultaneously changed drastically and also somehow stayed exactly the same. </span><i><span>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</span></i><span> is still clinging on to a 9.5 rating, but </span><i><span>Cory in the House</span></i><span> is back down to a 9.3. </span><span>The big change is in the number of ratings on Metacritic. I made a note on the 13th that the PS5 version of</span><i><span> Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</span></i><span> had roughly 23,351 ratings. Now it has 23,654 user ratings. On the other hand, </span><i><span>Cory in the House</span></i><span> had roughly 2,400 ratings on the same date. Now that’s climbed up to whopping </span><a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/disney-cory-in-the-house/"><span>4,666 user ratings</span></a><span>. Actually, never mind, I typed that and then immediately refreshed the page. Now it’s up to 4,684.</span></p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">As a result of users flooding metacritic &amp; pushing the game to the #2 spot of all time, sealed copies of Cory In The House have skyrocketed by more than 3000% in the past 2 weeks. <a href="https://t.co/nlVkLGWP0V">pic.twitter.com/nlVkLGWP0V</a></p> <p>— Resell News 💸 (@resellnews) <a href="https://twitter.com/resellnews/status/2011945080198930695?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 15, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span>The point is, the focus is less on review-bombing </span><i><span>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</span></i><span>, as some had assumed, and more on reverse review-bombing </span><i><span>Cory in the House. </span></i><span>That also probably goes some way toward explaining the recent meme-fueled price increases for physical copies of the Nintendo DS game on eBay. </span><span>The first writer to spot this story seems to have been </span><a href="https://www.cllct.com/sports-collectibles/auctions/cory-in-the-house-meme-makes-video-game-flop-a-collectible-hit"><span><em>Cllct</em>’s Will Stern</span></a><span>.

              <p>The<em> Inverse</em> gaming section is dead. Three staff, including Deputy Editor Shannon Liao, were laid off from the website on Friday as it reportedly “divests from gaming.” It’s a shift that comes as owner Bustle Digital Group pivots to being an “influencer company,” whatever that is.</p> <p>Launched in 2015 by Dave Nemetz, who previously co-founded <em>Bleacher Report</em>,<em> Inverse</em> began life primarily as a tech and science website before later pivoting to entertainment and gaming. It will seemingly now only cover movies and TV as the gaming side of its masthead has been wiped out. Several staff, including Liao, shared the news on Bluesky.</p>

 <p>“After flying back from Vegas last week, I was just laid off from <em>Inverse</em> today,” she <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/shannonliao.bsky.social/post/3mcki3gpiy22o">wrote</a>. “<em>Inverse</em>‘s gaming section is being shut down as the company ‘divests’ from gaming content.

 <p>Bustle Digital Group, which purchased<em> Inverse</em> in 2019, has been on a rollercoaster ride over the last 12 months. Last February, it was being <a href="https://www.curbed.com/article/bryan-goldberg-bustle-digital-media-back-rent-lawsuit.html">sued for $3 million</a> it allegedly owed in back rent.&nbsp;CEO Bryan Goldberg, who also co-founded <em>Bleacher Report</em>, <a href="https://www.adweek.com/media/bdg-targeting-record-profits/">then announced in May</a> that profits were soaring and the company’s cost-cutting era was behind it.</p>

 <p>By the fall, however, he was pitching the investor world on a new pivot. “We are the next generation influence company,” Goldberg <a href="https://www.axios.com/2025/10/14/bdg-media-bustle-scary-mommy-nylon">told<em> Axios</em></a> last October. The idea was to turn style and clothing audience members into cash-generating influencers by giving them special access to brands. The whole thing still sounds really weird, but apparently 12,000 people applied. It’s basically the unpaid blogger network that <em>Bleacher Report</em> pioneered, but for Instagram.</p>

 <p><em>Update: 1/16/2026 1:09 p.m. ET: Clarified that one of Inverse Gaming’s staff members remains at the company.&nbsp;</em></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>It seems that the worlds of Fortnite and Fall Guys are going to collide again as a new collaboration has been teased. </p>



<p>A lot of rumours around Fortnite collaborations have been surfacing lately, with names like <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-office-x-fortnite-collaboration-could-be-coming-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Office</a>, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-rumored-to-be-working-on-a-minecraft-collab/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Minecraft</a>, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-x-chainsaw-man-could-be-the-next-anime-collaboration-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Chainsaw Man</a>, and more popping up. However, these were just rumours; now we have a confirmed collaboration on the way, and it’s with a game that Fortnite has already collaborated with in the past. </p>







<h2 id="h-fall-guys-mention-a-ball-in-fortnite-collaboration-tease">Fall Guys Mention ‘A Ball’ in Fortnite Collaboration Tease</h2>



<p>The confirmation of the 2026 collaboration between Fortnite and Fall Guys comes via an <a href="https://x.com/FallGuysGame/status/2012164984047120647" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> post (formerly Twitter) from the latter. The post states, “Beans caught practicing… something involving a ball. Might want to keep an eye on this, Fortnite.” Players have already started speculating what the “ball” could mean, with some guessing it’s basketball-related, while others think it could be related to other sports that involve a ball. </p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Fortnite and Fall Guys collaborated back in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-fall-guys-collab/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">2024</a>, through the ‘Where We Fallin’ event. In this special event, players had to find a Golden Bean Idol, which would then transform them into a Fall Guys bean and let them compete in an obstacle course in the sky. Players would earn Gold, Silver, or Bronze tier loot based on how quickly they complete the course.</p>



<p>The Fall Guys collaboration also made it to Creative, where players could not only create their own obstacle-course-filled islands but also explore 6 Islands published by Mediatonic. </p>







<p>In other news, check out the Fortnite update 39.20 <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-39-20-patch-notes-january-9/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">patch notes</a>, which introduced the South Park collab to the game.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section data-cy="article-content" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">Bethesda’s former Elder Scrolls loremaster has revealed his idea for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-vi">The Elder Scrolls 6</a> story, and how it would have set up The Elder Scrolls 7.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In an interview with <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/the-elder-scrolls/bethesdas-former-elder-scrolls-loremaster-on-why-he-left-starfields-communication-breakdowns-and-how-he-wanted-the-elder-scrolls-6-to-be-the-empire-strikes-back/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PC Gamer</a> discussing his dissatisfaction with working at Bethesda and subsequent departure from the company following the release of Starfield, Kurt Kuhlmann said if he had got the chance to lead The Elder Scrolls 6 it would have been like the beloved Star Wars movie The Empire Strikes Back.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Kuhlmann, who left Bethesda in 2023 after more than 20 years at the studio, said that in his story the elven supremacists the Thalmor would not only have been the big bad of The Elder Scrolls 6, but they would have ended the game on the road to victory. This, he said, would have turned Elder Scrolls’ long-running ‘player is the chosen one’ who achieves a definitive victory at the end of the game plot on its head, saying that while you would have “preserved hope for the future” by the end of The Elder Scrolls 6, “overall it looks like the Thalmor are on the march.”</p><span data-cy="faceoff-view-trigger"></span><p data-cy="paragraph">The problem, Kuhlmann said, is that he doubts Bethesda would go for an Elder Scrolls game with a “bad” ending such as this, and a cliffhanger is "completely unfeasible" because it takes so long for Bethesda to release new mainline games in the fantasy series. "That's not a good way to end a game and say, yeah, we'll see you in 10, 15 years,” he said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Alas, Kuhlmann’s idea is just that: an idea, and it’s unlikely that the actual storyline of The Elder Scrolls 6 will turn out to be anything like it. As for when we’ll find out, it could be some time yet. Last year, amid increasing pressure from fans for some information on the game, Howard said <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/im-preaching-patience-the-elder-scrolls-6-is-still-a-long-way-off-todd-howard-warns-fans-teases-potential-shadowdrop"><u>The Elder Scrolls 6 wouldn’t be out for some time</u></a>. In an interview with <a href="https://www.gq-magazine.co.uk/article/fallout-4-anniversary-todd-howard-interview" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>GQ magazine</u></a> to celebrate the release of Fallout 4 Anniversary Edition, Howard said The Elder Scrolls 6 is “still a long way off,” adding: “I’m preaching patience.

Those trailers are not cheap.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN. Find him on Twitter at @wyp100.

            <p>Julian Gerighty, a long-time key cog at Massive Entertainment, has announced that he's departing the Ubisoft-owned studio after 12 years to go and work on Battlefield at EA. His departure swiftly follows Ubisoft <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/having-asked-division-devs-to-lay-themselves-off-ubisoft-are-now-cutting-55-jobs-at-massive-and-ubisoft-stockholm">revealing earlier this week</a> that they're planning to lay off staff at Massive, with a voluntary redundancy process late last year reportedly having not resulted in enough departures to stave off this bloodletting.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the publishers have opted to take the opportunity of Gerighty's departure to reassure folks that The Division series is just fine.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"While we’ll miss him, his mark will live on at Massive and we’ll continue to bring the world he’s been part of creating to our players for years to come,” Ubisoft wrote in <a href="https://x.com/UbiMassive/status/2012157010784186856">said statement</a>. "For our players, don’t worry, Agents. Our teams who built this world with Julian are still here, carrying it forward with an ambitious, unchanged commitment for the future with The Division 2, The Division 2: Survivors, The Division Resurgence and The Division 3."</p>
<p>"It's time for me to hang up my go bag (keeping the watch) as I go on another grand adventure," Gerighty wrote in his own <a href="https://x.com/jgerighty/status/2012156450039033939">departure tweet</a>. "The Division future burns bright, and I can't wait for you to discover what the teams have been working on."</p>
<p>According to Ubisoft, veteran Division developers Yannick Banchereau and Mathias Karlson remain creative directors on The Division 2 and The Division 3 respectively, while The Division creative director Magnus Jansen is now helming The Division 2's extraction mode Survivors.</p>
<p>The Division 3 was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ubisoft-are-building-a-team-to-make-tom-clancys-the-division-3">announced back in 2023</a>, but word in had had gone pretty quiet until <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/the-division-3-will-have-as-big-an-impact-as-the-division-1-says-producer/">Gerighty recently said</a> in an appearance that the New Game+ Showcase that he reckoned it'll "have as big an impact" as the first Division game.</p><p>Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-division-definitive-edition-looks-like-it-may-be-thing-assuming-this-poster-in-japans-the-real-deal">a poster</a> spotted at a Ubisoft-run esports event in Japan earlier this week prompted speculation that a definitive edition of that first entry into the Clancy-filled series might be about to be revealed. As of writing, no such announcement's been forthcoming.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/deadpool-marvel-rivals-banter-references-gta-pokemon-67-2000660614</link>
            <guid>1408414</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Deadpool, Marvel’s merc with a mouth who loves to spout off meta jokes and wink at the camera, is the kind of gimmick character that can come together like a spectacular, fourth-wall-breaking fireworks show or </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/deadpool-vr-is-a-game-for-deadpool-fans-and-nobody-else-2000645514"><span>be so grating and obnoxious</span></a><span> that he can push you away from a project entirely.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>In </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-review-hero-shooter-overwatch-netease-1851717975"><i><span>Marvel Rivals</span></i></a><span>, Wade Wilson can’t just hijack the whole game with his antics; he has to synergize with the established dynamics of other heroes’ tool kits and banter. As such, developer NetEase has found a ton of really smart and funny ways to slot Deadpool into the game that are additive, rather than disruptive. And yes, he drops a fair amount of fun pop culture references to media both in and out of the Marvel universe.</span></p>

 <p><span>Deadpool’s in-game abilities and behavior </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/deadpool-marvel-rivals-role-fourth-wall-break-meta-2000659834"><span>include numerous nods to his tendency to break the fourth wall</span></a><span>, with comic-book-style panels and pop-ups often appearing around him, </span><a href="https://x.com/HoshizoraTTV/status/2012008202855203157"><span>in-character ability descriptions</span></a><span> that you can swap to the straightforward, “emotionless” descriptions written by the NetEase team for clarity’s sake if you prefer, and even the ability to have conversations with announcer Galacta.</span></p>

    <p><span>His banter with </span><i><span>Marvel Rivals</span></i><span>’ other heroes is full of nods to pretty much every facet of the Marvel multimedia franchise. He makes references to the </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/8EaW9rnSJNc"><i><span>Rivals</span></i><span> community leakers</span></a><span> and memes as well as to the MCU’s </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/avengers-doomsday-teaser-leak-thor-doom-trailer-avatar-2000654848"><span>fumbling multiverse saga</span></a><span>, and there’s also an </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/waHFQEfGY-c"><span>“It’s Morbin’ Time!” line</span></a><span> referencing the notorious Sony</span> <span>flop </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/morbius-memes-twitch-movie-morbing-time-nintendo-switch-1848987370"><i><span>Morbius</span></i></a><span>. As </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-is-desperate-to-make-avengers-doomsday-the-biggest-event-of-2026-2000659295"><span>pretentious and self-important as Marvel has become</span></a><span> in the past 20 years as its movies have shifted pop culture, Deadpool does usually act as a reminder that someone in the writing room is paying attention to the criticism people have been levying at the franchise for years now. Even </span><i><span>Deadpool &amp; Wolverine</span></i><span> was </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/x-men-movies-best-worst-ranked-deadpool-logan-wolverine-1851595435"><span>taking shots at the MCU from the inside</span></a><span>.</span></p>

   <p><span>But it’s not all Marvel references. It’s fitting that in a video game Deadpool would borrow lines from series like </span><i><span>Pok</span></i><i><span>é</span></i><i><span>mon</span></i><span>, </span><i><span>Grand Theft Auto</span></i><span>, and </span><i><span>Super Mario</span></i><span>. There’s some stuff from other media as well, like </span><i><span>Spongebob Squarepants</span></i><span>. From the looks of it, voice actor Alejandro Saab ad-libbed several of these lines and “can’t believe” that NetEase kept them in the game. Oh, and you’ll also find some memes like “67” and “Hawk Tuah” in the mix. The “67” one is </span><a href="https://x.com/nerdyomniman/status/2011606344210792595"><span>pretty clever, at least</span></a><span>, and can’t be spammed like the one in </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-soldier-76-6-7-emote-season-20-release-date-2000651668"><span>another hero shooter</span></a><span>.</span></p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">I CAN'T BELIEVE THEY KEPT ALL OF THIS! HAHAHAHAHA I love my job 🤣 <a href="https://t.co/IYABRuTEZq">https://t.co/IYABRuTEZq</a></p> <p>— Alejandro Saab | DEADPOOL | Marvel Rivals (@KaggyFilms) <a href="https://twitter.com/KaggyFilms/status/2011962195064525201?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 16, 2026</a></p></blockquote>   <p><span>Deadpool launches today as part of </span><i><span>Marvel Rivals</span></i><span>’ sixth season.</span></p>

                <p>The Italian Competition Authority is investigating Activision Blizzard over claims that the mobile games Diablo Immortal and Call of Duty Mobile engage in "misleading and aggressive practices."</p><p><a href="https://en.agcm.it/en/media/press-releases/2026/1/PS13020-PS13039" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The watchdog said</a> the games are structured in such a way to encourage people to "play more often, extend their gaming sessions, and take up promoted offers" through "the possible use of deceptive user-interface design."</p><p>"Examples include repeated prompts, both during and outside gameplay, urging users not to miss out on rewards--also through in-app messages and push notifications--as well as to purchase time-limited items before they become unavailable," the group said.</p><p>"These practices, together with strategies that make it difficult for users to understand the real value of the virtual currency used in the game and the sale of in-game currency in bundles, may influence players as consumers--including minors--leading them to spend significant amounts, sometimes exceeding what is necessary to progress in the game and without being fully aware of the expenditure involved."</p><p>The group further claims that the parental controls in Diablo Immortal and Call of Duty Mobile default to options "that offer a lower level of protection for minors," including allowing in-game purchases, social features, and "unlimited play time."</p><p>The Italian Competition Authority also said it wants to look into how Diablo Immortal and Call of Duty Mobile go about collecting personal data. "It seems that consumers--including minors--are led to select all consent options, including consent to profiling for commercial purposes, in the belief that they are faced with a mandatory choice," the group said.</p><p>GameSpot has reached out to Activision Blizzard for comment. The company and its franchises are now owned by Microsoft following the company's blockbuster $75.4 billion buyout.</p>

            <p>Senior producer for The Division series Julian Gerighty has announced his departure from Ubisoft, heading over to Battlefield Studios.</p>
<p><a href="https://x.com/UbiMassive/status/2012157010784186856">In a statement posted to social media</a>, the official Massive Entertainment account posted its fond farewells to Gerighty. It reads: "Today we want to share that Julian Gerighty, executive producer on the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/tom-clancys-the-division">Tom Clancy's The Division</a> franchise is heading off on to a new adventure at Battlefield Studios. While we will miss him, his mark will live on at Massive and we'll continue to bring the world he's been part of creating to our players for years to come.</p>
<p>"Julian, your legacy is part of this studio and remember: once an Agent, always an Agent."</p>

<p>This post ends with a short paragraph reassuring fans of The Division that the series will be left in good hands now that Gerighty is leaving, concluding: "Our teams who built this world with Julian are still here, carrying it forward with ambitious, unchanged commitment for the future with The Division 2, The Division 2: Survivors, The Division Resurgence and The Division 3."</p><p><a href="https://x.com/i/status/2012156450039033939">Gerighty himself posted a personal update</a>, stating: "It's time for me to hang up my go bag (keeping the watch) as I go on another grand adventure. The Division future burns bright, and I can't wait for you to discover what the teams have been working on. Long live The Division"</p>
<p>This news comes only a few months after <a href="https://x.com/UbiMassive/status/1979546362405351487">Massive Entertainment had to curb rumours that Gerighty was leaving the company</a>, and just one week after <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GE_C1ueUnss">he took part in an interview during the New Game + showcase</a>. During this interview he described The Division 3 as "a monster", and shared his belief it would have: "as big of an impact as The Division 1".</p>
<p>Despite this peculiar timing, it does appear as if both Massive Entertainment and Julian are leaving on good terms. Which is nice, we should all be so lucky. The Division 3, the project he is leaving behind, still hasn't got a release date are <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-quietly-confirms-its-working-on-the-division-3">remains a bit of a mystery over at Ubisoft and Massive</a>. One wonders if we'll be seeing it soon...</p>

<figure data-uuid="a9036198f3f22"><a title="Animal Crossing: New Horizons" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/a9036198f3f22/animal-crossing-new-horizons.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Yes, the time is finally upon us. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/animal-crossing-new-horizons-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Animal Crossing: New Horizons</a> is now available in its swanky new Nintendo Switch 2 Edition package!</p>
<p>While the free ver. 3.0 update arrived a little earlier than expected for <em>all</em> users (Switch 1 <em>and</em> 2), yesterday marked the big release of Nintendo's latest paid Switch 2 upgrade. This one includes a resolution bump, the new Megaphone item, Mouse Mode integration, and beefed-up online capabilities to make the most of GameChat.</p>
<p>It's something of a slight package, considering there's no free path between the two (it'll only set you back £4.19 / $4.99 to upgrade, but still), and that was our Alex's biggest gripe in his <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/animal-crossing-new-horizons-nintendo-switch-2-edition">6/10 review</a>. "It makes things a bit prettier, has a few more options to take advantage of the console’s new features," he wrote, "but all in all, it’s not an especially exciting upgrade".</p>

<p>But of course, this is Animal Crossing: New Horizons that we're talking about, perhaps <em>the</em> defining game of the Switch generation, so we want to hear what you think too.</p>
<p>Whether you've spent the whole day getting to grips with the latest addition to the NS2E lineup, or you're just diving in for the first time, you can tell us what you make of the upgrade in the following poll. And don't worry if you want to change your mind later on, you can come back whenever and do exactly that!</p>

			<p>On the onset of this year's edition of <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">CES</strong>, NVIDIA took advantage of one of the key tech shows of the year to <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-dlss-4-5-6x-mfg-240hz-gaming-400-games-available-on-all-rtx-gpus/"><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">introduce NVIDIA DLSS 4.5</strong></a> which, in its early iteration, left pretty much everyone <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">stunned</strong>, delivering in <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-dlss-4-5-in-quality-mode-delivers-better-image-quality-than-native-resolution-in-red-dead-redemption-2/"><strong>Quality mode better than native resolution quality in <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Red Dead Redemption 2</em></strong></a> and<a href="https://wccftech.com/this-really-puts-a-nail-in-amd-fsr-redstones-coffin-clair-obscur-expedition-33-nvidia-dlss-4-5-performance-mode-stuns-with-image-quality-close-to-native-4k/"><strong> close to native resolution image quality in Performance mode in <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33.</em></strong></a></p>



<p>The impressive image quality, however, comes at a <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">performance cost</strong> on previous-generation <strong>RTX 20 and 30 series GPUs</strong>, as older-generation cards lack <strong>FP8 support</strong>, which NVIDIA DLSS 4.5 leverages to deliver its stunning results. However, the performance hit may not be as severe as expected on some older GPUs, such as the RTX 3080.</p>



<p>A new comparison video shared on YouTube by <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://www.youtube.com/@MxBenchmarkPC"><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">MxBenchmark PC</strong></a> compares <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><strong data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)">Cyberpunk 2077</strong></em> running at 4K, 1440p, and 1090p resolutions at Ultra Settings and with ray tracing with Ultra Performance mode at 4K resolution, Balanced mode at 1440p resolution, and Quality mode at 1080p resolution using the following presets:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>DLSS 3 - Preset E</strong></li>



<li><strong>DLSS 4 - Preset K</strong></li>



<li><strong>DLSS 4.5 - Preset L for Ultra Performance and Preset M for everything else</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>The results are, as YouTube user darknuance_ix put it, <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">"not bad at all."</em> While the <strong>performance hit is noticeable</strong>, it's, on average, <strong>lower than expected</strong> - in the <strong>8, 12 FPS range at all resolutions</strong> from NVIDIA DLSS 3 to DLSS 4.5. </p>



<p>As such, the latest version of the upscaler powered by the 2nd-generation Transformer model may still be a viable option for those still rocking RTX 20 and 30 series cards, who also have the option of setting a lower base resolution and still enjoy excellent image quality to offset the performance loss, although how effective this will be will obviously vary depending on the game.</p>
