<figure><a title="LEGO Voyagers Review - Screenshot 1 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/158950/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure><p>If you asked me what sort of game genre I think makes the best use of the Lego brick-building format, I’m not sure I’d answer with a two-player co-op adventure game. But here we are with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/lego-voyagers">LEGO Voyagers</a>, a touching co-op title from Light Brick Studio (<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/lego_builders_journey">LEGO Builder's Journey</a>) that uses the brick-based gameplay to send you and another player on a small adventure.</p>
<p>Voyagers is a hybrid between a platformer and a puzzle game, utilising a very simple control scheme. You pilot either a red brick or a blue brick that live together on an idyllic little Lego island, and after a mishap nearby, the two bricks set out on an adventure that takes them to some strange and scary new places.</p>
<p>It’s strictly two-player co-op, so you can’t play this alone, but you can either tackle it online with someone or in couch co-op. The latter is how I played the game, over a couple of evenings with my fianceé. If one of you owns the game, a second player can also download a free Friend’s Pass, so that’s something to keep in mind.</p>
<figure><a title="LEGO Voyagers Review - Screenshot 2 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/158948/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Voyagers’ gameplay and tone are very charming, and it’s all helped along with a gorgeous art style, which especially shines on Switch 2. While the protagonist bricks have one emotive little eye, the world itself uses realistic lighting to make those plastic platforms look almost realistic, albeit made entirely of Lego. Adding to the whimsy of the two main bricks you control, you can press 'Y' at any time to make a little grunt or noise, and it’s always adorable.</p>
<p>Upon setting off on your adventure, it’s clear that Lego Voyagers feels a bit clumsy to control. Instead of simply running around, you must roll your individual bricks, with all of the resistance that rolling a cuboid against steps and other bricks brings. It’s often a mission in and of itself getting your little brick to the right spot, and while rolling them around is fun, this resistance occasionally gets tiresome, especially when trying to reach difficult platforms.</p>
<p>Thankfully, it’s not just platforming, however, as the game's focus is on the different little islands or areas you encounter, and individual puzzles. Each chapter feels like its own diorama, and as you might expect from a Lego game, you and whoever you are playing with will be doing a lot of building.</p>
<figure><a title="LEGO Voyagers Review - Screenshot 3 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/158951/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Most puzzles involve you trying to get from A to B, and making either a bridge or some sort of steps to do so. It’s a concept that feels quite obvious, but is still really engaging. There’s just something so baseline enjoyable about putting Lego bricks together, especially when doing it with someone else.</p>
<p>To move bricks, you roll over to them and press 'A' to snap your red or blue brick onto them. Then, you roll over to your destination and press and hold 'A' again to assign a space for the other bricks. From this angle, you can quickly rotate bricks with 'X' and place them wherever you want.</p>
<p>This snapping onto bricks feels quite intuitive, and is essential to platforming as well, as later you must jump between ledges and use the snapping feature to move forward. It takes a while to understand, but it’s well executed. However, it doesn't always feel as tight as it should, and occasionally my partner had to hand her controller to me, as she couldn’t quite nail exactly what the platforming sections demanded.</p>
<figure><a title="LEGO Voyagers Review - Screenshot 4 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/158947/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>From here, there are a few different types of puzzles, or ways to extend the ‘bridge-building’ concept a bit further, but ultimately, the game only has around two or three solutions you’ll ever need to find. Even when other things are littered around, the game mostly focuses on building a bridge or steps. This feels a bit disappointing, as with a two-player co-op title, I want the chance to communicate with the other player and solve a larger puzzle together.</p>
<p>Quite often, Voyager devolved into realising we had to build a bridge, and my partner just watching me do it because I found it easier to control. One puzzle involved moving a boat around to gather batteries, and the mixture of both players having to move the boat, and figure out the smaller puzzles around the batteries was a highlight, but a high that was all too rare.</p>
<p>There’s an argument to be made that Lego Voyagers is a ‘vibes’ game, as between the gorgeous visuals and the beautifully propulsive synth-led soundtrack, you’re probably just meant to experience this game together and enjoy the ride. We certainly did enjoy the ride, but compared to the constant ingenious puzzle-solving and essential communication of titles like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/it_takes_two">It Takes Two</a>, Voyagers often left us silent, waiting for one person to do what clearly needed to be done.</p>
<figure><a title="LEGO Voyagers Review - Screenshot 5 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/158949/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Outside of the gameplay itself, the visual language of the game is often confusing, too. On the main menu, it is almost impossible to tell what option you’re picking, as the selected text just goes a slightly different shade of white. Then, in the game, there’s quite a lot of screen shake that made both of us occasionally feel unwell. And that extremely bright lighting gives an overly washed-out look, which also meant that often we found it really hard to tell either where our bricks were or which bricks we could use to move forward.</p>
<p>There is a really lovely game here, but before you spend £19.99/$24.99, be aware that this is around a four or five-hour game maximum, and two or three at minimum.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>While I adored Lego Voyagers' visual style and emotive design of the main bricks, I often found the actual puzzles underwhelming, and the game ended just as they started to get interesting.</p>
<p>If you ever find this on sale and want to just enjoy an evening with someone, this is a clever little co-op adventure with surprisingly touching themes. But when it comes to the difficulty of the main puzzles and the amount of content on offer, Lego Voyagers feels a few bricks short of a full set.</p></section>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Today, independent developer Keepsake Games is launching its debut game, Jump Space, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1757300/Jump_Space/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on Steam Early Access</a> and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-us/games/store/jump-space-game-preview/9p95q2bl6gs4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Xbox Game Preview</a>. At Gamescom 2025, I met with Keepsake Games co-founder and game director Filip Coulianos (who previously worked at Hazelight Studios with Josef Fares) to discuss this first-person cooperative space adventure game where up to four players take the roles of a spaceship's crew. The backstory is that evil robots have attacked humans everywhere in the galaxy and, as such, robots are the game's antagonists.</p>



<p>In Jump Space, the spaceship is your collective Diablo character. You'll keep upgrading it together as you complete missions throughout the game. A session starts in the hangar, where you meet up, customize your character, pick what ship to play and which components you want for the ship, and then choose the mission. The game is powered by the Unity engine and isn't that much of a looker, but it runs very smoothly, even at this stage.</p>



<p>It's best to immediately clarify that Jump Space is not some kind of sci-fi simulation game. Instead, it is meant to be very accessible, with highly intuitive controls. That said, every component of the spaceship is physically represented. You can walk up to the engine and uninstall it. If the engine breaks down in the middle of a mission, someone must run down there and fix it. </p>



<p>There's also a power grid where a block represents every component in the ship, and the challenge is to fit everything onto the green squares. If you have really powerful weapons, they will be very big blocks, and you might not be able to fit everything onto the grid. This means you have to really think about what things you can bring on a mission. </p>



<p>Keepsake Games also hammered in another key feature: the seamlessness between the inside and outside of the spaceship. Players can just walk on the outside, double-type space, detach themselves from the ship and fly around in zero G. If you hold SHIFT, you will start flying around. You can also board other ships while flying; it's all seamless. Lastly, there's a grappling hook-type gadget that can be used to latch on surfaces. It is very useful when moving in and out of the spaceship.</p>



<p>At this stage, Jump Space is a little barebones in terms of content, but it's also very fun to play. Depending on how well the developer is able to expand and improve the game throughout early access, it could turn out to be a very popular title in the genre. The game is currently $19.99 and</p>

<p><strong>Philip, what are we doing here?</strong></p>



<p>For this mission, we will travel to and defend a friendly ship that has been attacked by evil robots. To get there, we have to do a series of jumps now.</p>



<p><strong>Can you fly without people being seated?</strong></p>



<p>Yes, you can, but then they would die. You'd have to revive them and that costs resources, so it's probably not a good idea. It's worth noting that with every mission, we don't really know what's going to happen because the map is procedurally generated, so we don't know what awaits us. We also share ammunition, so we might run out of that. But you can craft ammunition, components, weapons and stuff like that on the ship using a shared resource called materia. </p>



<p><strong>Can every player repair ship components?</strong></p>



<p>Yes, we don't have classes in the game, so anybody can do anything. You can just drop everything you're doing and get to the most pressing task.</p>



<p>This is a mission in a super-compressed format with two jumps. Obviously, there can be long missions with eight jumps that last like half an hour. It depends on how much time you want to spend in the game.</p>



<p><strong>Do you also have missions on planets?</strong></p>



<p>Yes, absolutely. We didn't see that in here, but there are definitely desert planets, ice planets, asteroids, and moonlike areas. Roughly half of all the levels take place on different types of planets. Some missions are much more on foot, others are more on the ship, and others still are a mix of the two.</p>



<figure><figcaption><em>Roughly half of all the levels take place on different types of planets. Some missions are much more on foot, others are more on the ship, and others still are a mix of the two.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Do you have a randomized mission system, too?</strong></p>



<p>Yeah. In the mission we just saw, all the jumps up to the very end were all kind of randomized. Even if we played the same defend the ship mission five times, it would never quite play the same way, and what happens within each level is also a little bit different every time.</p>



<p>Sometimes there could be very few enemies, sometimes it could be a lot. We also have an AI in the background that we call the Director, which keeps track of what we're doing. It could spawn various events that could happen, like asteroid showers or ion storms, if we're doing too well. Even if all the levels you're seeing are handcrafted, there's a lot of randomized aspects to the game.</p>



<p><strong>What about the planets in Jump Space? Are they randomized, too?</strong></p>



<p>The planets are handcrafted. But you can't fly around the entire planet, as every level is kind of a bubble. If you tried to fly in a direction, eventually, after a long while, again, the game would tell you to turn back. So, it's not procedurally generated. Nothing really is. We just have some randomization in the end, in sort of the composition of a mission and what happens within each level.</p>



<p><strong>I saw something like character levels. Is that right?</strong></p>



<p>Yeah. That is kind of under development. The idea is that the more emissions you play and finish, the higher you can get with the level of your character. Certainly, rewards will be given to you, depending on what level you are, so maybe you get like a helmet at level 10 or something like that. We'll see how we developed that in the future, but for now, it's more to show off how long you've been playing.</p>



<p><strong>Would you get more powerful with those rewards?</strong></p>



<p>During the early access of Jump Space, we're going to work on allowing you to customize your character so that maybe you can add augmentations to your suit. Also, right now, you're stuck with one pistol, and maybe you will be able to unlock different pistols, stuff like that. It's not in the game right now, but it's something we are going to work on during early access. Right now, most of the upgrades are focused around the ship. But we can tell that players will really want to upgrade their characters as well. That's going to be something that happens during early access.</p>



<p><strong>What else are you planning to add throughout the early access phase?</strong></p>



<p>One thing the community really wants is more ships. We have two ships now, but we look forward to make much more in the future. Another thing is more missions. At the early access launch, there's only Chapter One, but with every big update, we'll add more missions with the story that finally concludes with us fighting against the evil robots. We'll add more equipment for players.</p>



<p>Another thing that's been pretty popular among the community is endless missions, trying to survive for as many jumps as possible. The game would never end up until your crew gets destroyed, trying to get as far as it can. Generally, we also want to expand the difficulty spectrum of missions, catering to both casual players and more hardcore players.</p>



<p>Of course, right now, we're releasing for PC and Xbox. We would like to release Jump Space on all consoles, but as we are a small team, we're gonna do one console at a time.</p>

But we can tell that players will really want to upgrade their characters as well.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Did you already think about a potential Nintendo Switch 2 port?</strong></p>



<p>I mean, right now, we're open to anything. I think it depends on how well we are doing, how well the game is selling, and how well the Switch 2 is doing.</p>



<p><strong>So far, I would say the Switch 2 is doing pretty well. Anyway, do you have cross-play between the PC and Xbox version?</strong></p>



<p>We do not. We are just a small team and we have to really be careful about what we attempt to do. Maybe sometime in the far future. We want to focus on the game first.</p>



<p><strong>Do you have humanoid enemies as well, or just robots?</strong></p>



<p>No. We do robots, mainly because of production reasons. They're easy to make, while making humans is a lot more work. We would love to have like pirates and stuff you can fight off. I think that depends on how well the game is doing, and you know, if we can expand the team. Nothing is off the table, but it's just a matter of where do we want to put our money.</p>



<p><strong>How many developers do you have at Keepsake?</strong></p>



<p>We're sixteen in the office at Stockholm, and then we have some contractors, but the team itself has like 16 people.</p>



<p><strong>I know you've got some prior experience, though.</strong></p>



<p>Yes, I was a founding member of Hazelight. I worked a lot with Josef Fares on <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/a-way-out/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">A Way Out</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/it-takes-two-love-multi-genre/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">It Takes Two</a>, and Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons. </p>



<p><strong>This is a very different game from those titles.</strong></p>



<p>Definitely. This game has really been something I've been working on in my spare time for a long time before starting the studio. I really love sci-fi. But the lessons I learned while at Hazelight were very valuable. Even though the games are different, there's a little bit of magic from Hazelight as well.</p>



<p><strong>What's the price going to be?</strong></p>



<p>$19.99.</p>



<p><strong>Do you plan to increase it after early access?</strong></p>



<p>That's the plan. We'll see how quickly or how far into the development of early access. It depends on the reception we get and how much content we're able to produce.</p>



<p>This is a co-op game, and you don't want the price to be why one of your friends doesn't want to jump in with you, right? We're quite aggressive on the price, but we're hoping to compensate by having a lot of people be able to play. We'll definitely announce way ahead of time if we decide to increase the price. </p>

We'll definitely announce way ahead of time if we decide to increase the price. </em></figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Do you think you'd be open to adding Jump Space to Game Pass and/or PlayStation Plus if Microsoft or Sony asked? Would you like that?</strong></p>



<p>Depends on the deal. We're open for anything. It depends on what deal is on the table. We're great fans of Game Pass, for example. We've been using, but it all depends on what we get in return.</p>



<p><strong>Do you plan to support mouse and keyboard on Xbox at some point? </strong></p>



<p>Yes. We don't have it today, but it sounds like it should be pretty easy to do.</p>



<p><strong>Thank you for your time.</strong></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Atlus has released the first ever official music video for a song from the&nbsp;<em>Persona&nbsp;</em>series, and the video sets one of&nbsp;<em>Persona 3 Reload</em>'s most iconic battle themes to a very thematically relevant visual element.</p>

<p>The video is for the battle theme "It's Going Down Now", which plays whenever the party gets the drop on an enemy in the Tartarus dungeon in&nbsp;<em>Persona 3 Reload</em>. If you're anything like me, that means you'll be hearing the song hundreds of times over the course of your time with the game.</p>

<p>As revealed in a press release, "It's Going Down Now" is the most-streamed song from the&nbsp;<em>Persona 3 Reload&nbsp;</em>soundtrack on Spotify, having built up over 100 million plays. It makes sense, then, that this was the song chosen for the series' first music video.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/persona-3-reload-music-video-battle.jpg?itok=HVo2nqiA 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/persona-3-reload-music-video-battle.jpg?itok=2wf_ubTj 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Persona</em>'s first ever music video is for a battle theme from&nbsp;<em>Persona 3 Reload</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>The track was created specifically for&nbsp;<em>Persona 3 Reload</em>; it doesn't have an equivalent in the original&nbsp;<em>Persona 3</em>, which simply uses the equally iconic "Mass Destruction" as its general battle theme. That song still plays in&nbsp;<em>Persona 3 Reload</em>, but only for battles in which you don't have the advantage.</p>

<p>The music video for "It's Going Down Now" sees rapper Lotus Juice and singer Azumi Takahashi performing in front of&nbsp;<em>Persona 3 Reload</em>'s famous Tartarus steps, which lead up to the dungeon proper. The video is also interspersed with other visuals you'll recognize if you're a&nbsp;<em>Persona 3 Reload&nbsp;</em>fan.</p>

<p>You can check out the music video for "It's Going Down Now" in its entirety right here. If you've played the game, it's a great opportunity to hear the song for that extra-special thousand-and-first time.</p>




<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Persona 3 Reload</em>, it's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/persona-3-reload-persona-5-tactica-leaked-by-atlus-itself" rel="nofollow">a remake</a> of Atlus' cult hit JRPG&nbsp;<em>Persona 3</em>&nbsp;that boasts all-new visuals, gameplay improvements, and a rearranged soundtrack.</p>

<p>The game proved a success for publisher Sega and developer Atlus, having <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/persona-3-reload-sales-2m" rel="nofollow">racked up two million sales</a> around the world at last count. A remake of its successor,&nbsp;<em>Persona 4</em>, was announced during this year's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xbox-games-showcase-2025-all-news-and-announcements" rel="nofollow">Xbox summer showcase</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>In case it wasn’t clear, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/21286964/the-last-of-us-part-2-review-ps4"><em>The Last of Us</em></a> made it obvious: at their very best, big-budget video games should be comparable to prestige television, so much so that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tv-reviews/644415/the-last-of-us-season-2-review-hbo">adapting one for HBO</a> is a relatively straightforward affair. This bar-setting exercise is further exemplified by other PlayStation franchises marching toward adaptation: <em>Ghost of Tsushima</em> is set to be a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/25/22350484/sony-ghost-of-tsushima-movie-film-director-john-wick-sucker-punch">film</a> and <a rel="sponsored" href="https://crunchyrollstore.sjv.io/c/482924/1941456/20100?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.crunchyroll.com%2Fnews%2Fannouncements%2F2025%2F1%2F7%2Fghost-of-tsushima-legends-anime-series-2027-crunchyroll%3Fsrsltid%3DAfmBOoqRO6dRM2VdzQBXlAkJr6kS0nu4n2YPdzHlhw_-LTWt1frOto5M">anime</a>, <em>God of War</em> has <a href="https://deadline.com/2024/10/god-of-war-ronald-d-moore-amazon-series-showrunner-1236122550/">Prime Video aspirations</a>, and <em>Horizon Zero Dawn</em>, previously on its way to becoming a Netflix series, is now <a href="https://variety.com/2025/gaming/global/last-of-us-fallout-creators-tv-adaptations-bafta-games-awards-1236352651/">being adapted for cinemas</a>. It’s not an accident: games at this scale are a high-risk affair, too expensive to just be games.</p><p>Some developers, however, make it look easy by taking the exact opposite approach. Japanese developer Nihon Falcom, an early trailblazer in the RPG space, has steadily built out one of the grandest stories in video games with its <em>Trails</em> series. Thirteen games deep, the Trails games span the continent of Zemuria and the nations within it, juggling personal relationships with a wider interest in the march of history and how cultures and governments respond to the destabilizing advance of modernity. What Falcom has done here is astonishing and unparalleled for a single studio of its size — which, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-08-15/toshihiro-kondo-falcom-ceo-behind-trails-games-started-off-as-a-fan">according to <em>Bloomberg</em></a><em>,</em> sits at 68 employees — and it did so by resisting the mainstream gaming impulse to equate lavish expense with quality.</p><p>If most big-budget games are chasing the sensibilities of prestige TV, Falcom’s games are comparable to the soap opera: affordable, modest affairs that are not as widely acclaimed as their peers but passionately followed by a small but growing audience. (Sales of the <em>Trails </em>series sit at <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-08-15/toshihiro-kondo-falcom-ceo-behind-trails-games-started-off-as-a-fan">8.8 million copies</a>.) What they lack in visual flair and technical prowess (which is a lot) they make up for in narrative complexity and long, rewarding character arcs (which is astounding). The pleasures of the <em>Trails</em> series lie in watching small-stakes hangouts curdle into gut-wrenching conflicts as characters’ individual struggles get subsumed by political machinations and ideologues who seek to hijack technological progress for their own bigoted ends.</p><p>Under company president Toshihiro Kondo’s leadership, Falcom has been working to grow its audience slowly, narrowing the gap between <em>Trails</em> games’ Japanese releases and their worldwide localizations, partnering with other studios to bring its older titles to modern platforms, and, in its most confident step of all, releasing a new ground-up remake of the first game to give the curious the perfect on-ramp. That remake, <em>Trails in the Sky 1st Chapter</em>, is more than just a reworking of a cult favorite. It’s a document of Falcom’s progress — the studio’s technologically crudest game remade with the gloss of its most recently localized installment, 2022’s <em>Trails Through Daybreak</em> <em>II</em>.</p><p>The result is spectacular. <em>1st Chapter</em> takes a clunky, patient turn-based RPG and transforms it into a slick and modern experience, incorporating 21 years of Falcom’s growth alongside innovations cribbed from other games, like <em>Persona 5</em>. Systems are thoughtfully layered to combine both action- and turn-based RPG mechanics with pizzazz; players that enter a fight with a clear strategy will be able to execute it while hardly feeling like they’re in a turn-based encounter at all. Those who like to take things slow can also kick it old-school, like nothing ever changed.</p><p>Of course, such an effective remake will then make things a bit awkward for those who want to continue on. <em>1st Chapter</em> is the first half of a two-part story about Estelle and Joshua Bright, adoptive siblings who join an outfit of civic-minded mercenaries and discover a grand conspiracy in the kingdom of Liberl. A remake of the sequel <a href="https://www.inverse.com/gaming/the-trails-in-the-sky-1st-chapter-sky-the-3rd-remakes-falcom">seems to be underway</a>, but after that, there are nearly a dozen more games across multiple sub-series, each set in a different region. Each sub-series has its own central plot and advances the wider <em>Trails</em> story, each presages future titles and references back to previous ones, and each is available on different platforms and has its own design quirks and difficulties. Playing them all can be a real headache.</p><p>Yet people still seek <em>Trails</em> out, still want to embark on this strange journey through Zemuria. Part of the appeal isn’t just the story being told, it’s <em>talking</em> about the story that’s told. The unique structure of these games allows people to talk to each other across the fictional time and space of its setting. Talking to someone who is a sub-series or two ahead of you, or playing out of order, is like corresponding with someone in another country: <em>Things are a little different here, but a lot of what you love is also present. Let me tell you about it.</em></p><p>Everything about this is deliberate. In <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hot-on-the-trails-of-falcom-japans-longest-running-rpg-developer">a 2019 interview with <em>Eurogamer</em></a>, Kondo stated that the studio’s founder, Masayuki Kato, made the express decision to focus on writing while others chased graphics. “As time progressed, other companies began putting a lot more manpower into graphics. We realised we’d need well over 100 people solely focused on that,” Kondo said. “But our founder [Kato] realised if we can get a writer who knows how to write good stories, and is able to build up their knowledge as a writer, that’s something we can make a sales point going forward.”</p><p>It’s not limited to Falcom, either. Other studios have found success this way. RGG Studio’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22321087/yakuza-like-a-dragon-story-interview-masayoshi-yokoyama">sprawling <em>Like a Dragon</em> saga</a> continually wrings new flavors of gangster melodrama out of the same locations and characters, carefully expanding its scope to include new game mechanics and locales, finding new fans along the way. Similarly, Atlus built its massive <em>Shin Megami Tensei</em> franchise on grueling dungeon crawlers that weren’t afraid to be quite similar, applying the designs of Kazuma Kaneko in new contexts, widening the franchise’s appeal by shifting genres and tones until striking it big with the most recent <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/3/29/15098458/persona-5-review-ps4-ps3"><em>Persona</em></a> games.</p><p>This recycling of design work used to be frowned upon by video game fans and some press, who demanded some kind of graphical novelty accompany every release. All sorts of dirty words would be attributed to this process, from “asset flipping” to the more broadly popular accusation of “lazy devs.” Indulging in this attitude has led to the current graphical arms race, with its skyrocketing costs and widening gaps between new game releases. But there is another way. It’s a very old way, one that is reminiscent of the 8- and 16-bit eras, where technological progress was prized but not so ruthlessly pursued, because their visual fidelity had not yet put them in spitting distance of Hollywood.</p><p>Video games are not film or television, but they all can connect with people in ways indifferent to the money spent to produce them. For Falcom and <em>Trails</em>, it’s about building the most singularly sprawling story in video games, which the studio achieved by putting its resources where fans care most, and getting around to the rest when it was possible. And what’s incredible is that in spite of these games’ uneven visual quality, their niche anime appeal, the lack of a massive staff, and a frankly daunting number of installments totalling many hours of gameplay — the team just might pull it off.</p><p><sub>Trails in the Sky 1st Chapter<em> launches September 19th on Steam, the PS5, and the Nintendo Switch / Switch 2.</em></sub></p><p><span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/781492/trails-in-the-sky-1st-chapter-switch-ps5-steam#comments"><span>0<!-- --> <!-- -->Comments</span></a></span></p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6Mzc2NDc="><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Joshua Rivera</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games/781492/trails-in-the-sky-1st-chapter-switch-ps5-steam]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		<p><em>A home is where the heart is. It's also where crumbs drop, fester, and eventually attract creatures to feast upon it. There are piles of dust. Clothes pile up. Dishes stack. A home—an apartment, a room, a house, whatever—requires attention.</em></p><p><em>Rob, as you probably know, is beginning to grasp what it means to turn that kind of attention to a much bigger space than he's already known. There are going to be losing battles. You cannot keep an entire house clean. Instead, it's about shuffling priorities, dividing labor between partners, and realizing some stuff stays dirty.</em></p><p><em>So, sure, home is where the heart is. It's also where the dirt is. </em></p><p><em>Dirt is love?</em></p><hr><p><strong>Rob: </strong>Division of household labor has always been kind of fraught around my house. I was raised to do a lot of chores: clean the kitchen and bathrooms, wash the cars, vacuum the house, mow the lawn, do laundry, occasionally dust (I did it less than I was supposed to because I hated it so much). Somewhere in there I also became someone who was, if not a neat freak, sensitive to when things got a little too messy. At some point a threshold will be crossed and I immediately need to start cleaning up whatever problem I’ve spotted. MK, on the other hand, is oblivious to mess. It’s not that she can’t appreciate a clean house versus a cluttered and messy one, it’s just that if she’s got her mind elsewhere (and she usually does) then her surroundings don’t really register.</p><p>There’s the added fact that MK has some physical constraints around dysautonomia that make it tough for her to spend a lot of time on her feet. Basically the stuff that everyone’s nervous system is supposed to do automatically to even-out bloodflow in different postures and at different activity levels? Hers doesn’t do that real well, and will occasionally try and cause her to black out like a pilot pulling 7Gs because she stood up too fast. That means we have to be real selective about what is worth her limited time on her feet. Taking the dogs out? Not too hard now that we live in a house where she can just walk outside and not wait for an elevator. Dishes? That’s a lot of standing in front of a sink or next to a dishwasher. She can do it but it’s rarely worth it.</p><p>So we’ve always had to think about what is the extra stuff I take on around the house, and then what we have to offload somehow. Even before MK’s health issues cropped up, cleaners were a necessity for maintaining a baseline level of cleanliness around the house without us having to negotiate or nag at each other.</p><p>However, the new house poses new challenges. Our yard requires a lot of work if we’re going to keep it looking as nice as it has under the previous owners. There’s about thirty years of previous landscaping and horticulture here that has created a pretty idyllic yard but we’ve lived in city apartments our entire adult lives. I never liked yard work when I lived with my parents and, more importantly, I have no idea what I’m doing with flowers or decorative pushes and trees. Plus, the new house is much bigger than the old condo, and cleaners’ prices understandably scale with the size of the home. Having someone come clean our condo was a small luxury, not much more than splurging on delivery sushi for a night. Having cleaners fully service the new place would suddenly be like having a new car payment.</p><p>So we’re each going to have to do more, and that’s got me thinking about what are the chores that are easiest for me to do, and which are the ones I actually like the most. What are the household task power rankings?</p><p>I can tell you right at the start that cleaning the kitchen is S-tier. It’s something I’m good at, it can be really meditative if you’re giving it a full deep clean where all the appliances are getting unplugged, cleaned, and moved aside so the counters can receive a good scrub. It’s also maybe the most podcast-friendly task there is, so it’s easy to have fun paying attention to something else while I’m doing wax-on, wax-off stuff.</p><p>Garbage tier task? Weeding. This is more a personal thing for me, but there’s two issues. One, it’s all low to the ground and I’m tall, so it’s just physically uncomfortable and miserable. Two, I never know what’s&nbsp; the good-enough version of weeding a lawn or a garden. Do you pull out every plant that’s not supposed to be there? That’s a huge amount of work and might not even be appropriate for the health of the yard. But if you take too lax an approach, you might discover that the innocuous sprouts you ignored have turned into nutrient-sucking vampires who have metastasized into a lawn cancer around all the plants you actually care about. It feels like there’s a learning curve to it, but I hate the basic task so much I don’t want to invest the time into figuring out what is the stuff I have to do, should probably do, and can safely ignore.</p><p>What are your S and trash tier chores? You have any tasks you feel will “build character” if you make your kids do them?</p><figure><figcaption><span>Photo by </span><a href="https://unsplash.com/@anniespratt?ref=remapradio.com"><span>Annie Spratt</span></a><span> / </span><a href="https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=ghost&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=api-credit"><span>Unsplash</span></a></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Patrick:</strong> Hah, my wife is the opposite. I have to specifically mark boxes around the house that I do not want thrown out yet, because it’s something I’ve ordered and I’m not sure we want to keep it. (The most recent example was an alarm clock for my nine-year-old that was a little wonky. I wanted to keep the box for a week, see if the device was what we wanted. I told her this. She still threw the box out a day later.)</p><p>Chores in our house are interesting because they’re divided by proximity. I work from home every day of the week, while my wife spends at least a few days in downtown Chicago. It means, generally speaking, I’m the point of contact for everything related to the kids (i.e. sickness, activities) and much of the day-to-day household upkeep falls in my lap because I can fit them in-between things during work.</p>

              <p>LEGO is easily one of the most beloved sets of collectibles. Just about from kids to adults love them. They make for great toys, gifts, or collectors items. But really what it’s all about is the build. Loading up the latest episode of your favorite podcast or the next chapter of an audiobook your working through while you sit at a table on down on the carpet, putting pieces together one by one. You watch your progress unfold in front of you as your mind wanders and you forget about the stressors in your life. You get lost in it. And then when you’re done, you have a cool replica of the likely the most famous spaceship in cinema history.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4190/">On that note, you can get the LEGO Star Wars Millennium Falcon set for 20% off in honor of Bricktember.</a> Yes, we’re pretending that’s a real month. For a limited time, the price of this Star Wars LEGO set has come down from $85 to just $68. You’ll be saving a good $17.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4190/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Build Nostalgia</h2>
<p>This LEGO Millennium Falcon is built to be display (but I won’t tell any one if you pretend to fly it around your bedroom while making the noises). When displayed, it sits at a dynamic angle like it’s taking a tight turn. The model measures in at just over five inches tall, about nine and a half inches long, and then seven and a half inches deep. It’s a great fit for any moderately-sized shelf.</p>
<p>The 921-piece set of the renowned Corellian freighter starship first seen piloted by smuggler Han Solo and his loyal companion Chewbacca has every part of the ship inside and out in great detail. Well, decent detail. To keep everything to size, the characters are all depicted with just two or three small round pieced stacked on top of each other. LEGO even decided to represent that weird holographic chess game Han and Chewie play in George Lucas’ original trilogy.</p>



<p>LEGO and Star Wars collaborated on this set in honor of the 25th anniversary of LEGO Star Wars. Back in 1999, as a way to promote the new prequel trilogy’s first film&nbsp;<em>Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace</em>, LEGO released its first Star Wars sets. Among them were an X-Wing fighter, a Landspeeder, and even minifigures of Luke Skywalker and Ben Kenobi.</p>
<p>And now here we are a little over 25 years later, LEGO and Star Wars are just has over thousand sets together — but we’re only here to talk about one set.<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4190/"> Get this LEGO Millennium Falcon for 20% off for a limited time.</a></p>

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/resident-evil-requiem/">Resident Evil Requiem</a> is setting out to be one of the most interesting Nintendo Switch 2 ports launching next year, judging from the footage released so far.</p>



<p>During the latest episode of their weekly podcast, the tech experts at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@DFClipsChannel">Digital Foundry</a> compared the <a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-requiem-confirmed-for-nintendo-switch-2-with-new-trailer/">Nintendo Switch 2 version announcement trailer</a> of the next entry in the CAPCOM series with the same trailer captured on PC, highlighting how this port is going to be notable for how it has been built with ray tracing in mind and for how the Nintendo console will support RT in a seemingly competent capacity. </p>



<p>Comparing the two trailers shows how RTGI is present in the Switch 2 version, delivering an experience that looks very much the same as that on the other systems, although with some cutbacks regarding image quality, hair rendering, shadow maps resolution, and reflections, as this version of the game seems to lack RT reflections. Performance also seems to be a little unstable from the footage, but considering it has been captured on a pre-release build, there's a good chance Resident Evil Requiem's performance will better in its final release.</p>

<p>Building the game with ray tracing in mind seems to be doing wonders for the experience as a whole, as Resident Evil Requiem looked stunning when I tried it last month during <a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-requiem-gamescom-hands-on-preview-turn-on-the-lights/">Gamescom</a>. Although I wasn't able to experience combat, the short sequence set in Rhodes Hill Chronic Center made me very excited to see how the game will push the series forward when it launches on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S, and Nintendo Switch 2 on February 27, 2026.</p>

<p>"How beautiful, a divine quest so unobtainable..."</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Devolver Digital certainly has form when it comes to bringing us original indie games that go about things just a little bit differently than your usual fare, and with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/skate-story">Skate Story</a>, by developer Sam Eng, it seems the publisher's streak of off-kilter experiences looks set to continue. A good thing, we think you'll agree.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/skate-story">Skate Story</a>, which is set to drop at some point a little later this year on Switch 2, sees you assume the role of a skateboarder, nothing unusual about that. However, this particular skateboarder, you see...well, he's sort of made out of glass, it says here. He's made a deal with the devil and he has to skate to the moon and then swallow it in order to be freed. Yep.</p>
<p>What this all means for us players, apparently, is some incredibly cool-looking skateboarding action as your trippy, glass skater-boi gets busy blasting around the Wastelands en route to the actual moon. Good luck with that!</p>
<p>You can check out the slick new trailer for the game above, and here's some more official details and some Switch 2 screens:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ollie, kickflip, and grind your way through the ash and smoke of The Emptylands as you take on a seemingly impossible quest. Learn to master your weight and motion to conquer the weeping concrete. Savour the ritualistic beauty as you set your feet to pop a perfect kickflip.</p>
<p><strong>Hypnotic Beats for Demonic Streets</strong><br>
Cruise through The Underworld to a psychedelic soundtrack by enigmatic New York artist Blood Cultures, and additional tracks by John Fio.</p>
<p><strong>Stylish Street Skating Adventure</strong><br>
Skate through nine layers of The Underworld. Cruise through streets and surreal landscapes full of waxed ledges, unholy gaps, and tortured demons. Push your way through precarious paths and shred freeform skate spots. Discover and create your own challenges as you explore the world and master your board.</p>
<p><strong>Succumb To The Beauty of The Board</strong><br>
Sell your soul for decks, wheels, and trucks to keep your skating fresh. Over 70+ skate tricks to progress and improve. Complete skate trials to level up, learn new tricks, and get new gear. Destroy vicious demons with your 360 flip… or at least impress them.</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>It's all very stylish, the soundtrack seems awesome from what we glean from the short trailer, and there does seem to be an emphasis on actual skilful skating stuff, which has got our inner Tony Hawks very, very intrigued.</p>

</div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
I confess, after reading the comments on yesterday's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/endless-legend-2s-early-access-launch-is-a-triumph-of-asymmetrical-4x-design-but-i-do-wish-it-were-even-stranger">Endless Legend 2 early access impressions</a>, I am mortally afeared that I'm one of those accursed "positive outliers" I keep reading about in the Gamer Witchfinder Almanac. Seemingly, a fair portion of you were turned off by the recent Steam demo. You may be interested, then, to read specifics about how Amplitude have changed the game in response to demo feedback.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
As detailed in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3407390/view/496081198026588764?l=english">a new Steam post</a>, here's what they think you liked. Firstly, the Tidefall mechanic, whereby the ocean retreats periodically to reveal extra playable terrain, and the regular Monsoons that sweep the land. "This was a core element of the game, and we were happy to see it having a real impact," the devs write, adding that they tinkered a lot with the quantity of Monsoons and Tidefalls. Apparently, there were once eight smaller Tidefalls to every game of Endless Legend 2, so many that players began ignoring them.
</p>
<p>
They also reckon you're keen on the asymmetrical faction design - "always a focus of Amplitude" - and that you're mostly enjoying the art and sound, including the map design, characters and jingles for stuff like minor factions, or the weird echoey thudding you might hear during Monsoons.
</p>
<p>
Now for weaknesses. According to Amplitude, the bulk of the negative feedback concerned the user interface. "A quarter of reviews mentioned UI and only 30% of those comments were positive," they note. "In reading all your feedback we realize it's not as simple as making a few changes and we are looking at something larger. There are instances where we displayed the wrong or not enough information. There were UI and text bugs to fix and we think more is needed here, which will take some time."
</p><p>
In particular, they're looking at making the city screens more intelligible. "Adjacency, leveling districts, managing population, and having clear decisions on what to build next were all muddy," the devs write. This is a "flow issue", apparently, which I guess refers to how your eyeballs and attention move from one UI element to the next in the course of urban management.</p>
<p>Amongst other things, they might change up Districts so that you can select them from a construction list like Improvements, rather than picking a tile to build on first. "This will take time to change and won't be in the initial Early Access, but we will be sharing concepts with you to get feedback," the devs comment.
</p>
<p>
To belatedly update my impressions from yesterday, I haven't had much of a problem with the UI in the early access build, but there were definitely a couple of moments this week when the verdant tile designs made it hard to discern, say, city centres, or units inside cities. It's definitely rather busy, which is to be expected for a 4X <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy</a> game with such florid factions and a turbulent expanding map. I also sometimes forgot what right-click and left-click do in different contexts. I don't consider any of these deal-breakers, however.
</p>
<p>
Following on from those UI thoughts, Amplitude acknowledge that some players have found the colourful world a little too hallucinogenic. They've addressed this in early access by making city foundations clearer, so you know to build there, while getting rid of bugs (not the Necrophage) that caused blurriness, and adding more graphics options.  They've also reduced the colour saturation of the terrain a little and made the all-important hexagonal grid lines more prominent, while shrinking certain fancier vegetation that players kept confusing with Anomalies. 
</p><p>
"It's a difficult balance between providing a lush, detailed world where you can see the leaves blow in the wind during monsoon, and still not have to strain or be confused when trying to see information you need to play," the developers observe.
</p>
<p>
In my impressions of Endless Legend 2, I was most critical of the character writing. Demo players were also iffy about this side of the game. In their Steam post, Amplitude note that there are many more words in Endless Legend 2 than the 2014 original, including reams of character dialogue. "We want heroes to feel personal and deep," they write. "They may be members of your council, have their own friends and enemies, and they talk directly to you and each other. But this additional granularity also came with issues. 
</p>
<p>
"For Early Access we have updated the presentation of the dialog, we are cutting lines and events to focus on only the best and most suitable," the devs continue. "In some cases, the wrong character would say something, or a character it didn't make sense for, which we are fixing." I definitely picked up on a few instances of the latter, but my overarching problem with the character writing is that the focus on characters doesn't do certain factions justice. The Necrophage are a horde, not a cast. The Aspect are a reef, not an ensemble. That's what I find attractive about them conceptually, at least.
</p>
<p>
Endless Legend 2 launches into early access on 22nd September. It'll start off with five factions. They're planning to add a sixth plus multiplayer and custom faction support before the 1.0 release next year. If you end up disliking it please don't burn my house down.

Though yes, AI art is a plague on this planet and we should absolutely speak out against companies using it instead of hiring real artists, firing the accusation from the hip ultimately risks throwing the very artists you claim to be advocating for under the bus.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/fogpiercer-is-a-train-based-roguelite-deckbuilder-coming-out-next-year.1302426/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>There is a new roguelite deckbuilder chugging its way into town in the form of Fogpiercer, which is being developed by Mad Cookies Studio and published by Hooded Horse. Fogpiercer is set in a post apocalyptic world where the trains still run, but are the targets of bandits who want whatever the train carriages are carrying. Your mission is to fight off these bandits and get the train to safety.</p>
<p><iframe title="Fogpiercer - Announcement Trailer | Roguelite Deckbuilder On a Train" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OuEIQH6AsCU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The announcement trailer of Fogpiercer shows how the game works in practice. As you can see, the train has its set route to take, making it easy for bandits to roll up in their own vehicles and attack. However, the nature of this deckbuilder means you can equip the train with different carriages, and each of those as their own deck. These decks contain various cards that equip the train with offensive and defensive capabilities. Each ability has its own way of dealing with enemies, with some forcing enemies to crash into each other or get caught under the train. As the train chugs along, you will need to pick the route to travel, with different dangers presenting themselves.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-xiv-a-realm-reborn">Final Fantasy 14</a> director and producer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/naoki-yoshida">Naoki Yoshida</a> (Yoshi-P) intends to work on the game "for at least a good while", even as he works on other projects within <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a>.</p>
<p>In an interview with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8zydl9wAQuc">Noisy Pixel</a> at Pax West, Yoshida discussed what keeps him working on the MMORPG after 12 years, to which he described himself as "more of a businessman" than a creative person.</p>
<p>"People tend to say we're creators or creative, but I am an employee at Square Enix and I receive money to make games," he said, "and I think my primary purpose is to make games so that we are delivering it to gamers out there, fans, players that want to consume our product. I think that is fundamental or a minimum requirement that I have because I belong to this company."</p>

<p>He continued that designers working in a company and feeling bored should remove themselves from a corporate environment, but he doesn't "have that strong personal desire to go into my own creative things".</p>
<p>"So when asked, do I ever get bored with Final Fantasy 14?" Yoshida concluded. "I don't think so, because there are a lot of things that I have yet to actualise in 14, things that I want to do, things that I must do, things that require to be taken care of. And so I think for at least a good while, I should be ok."</p><p>Yoshida added he wishes to do less "management or operational things", joking he may be scolded for his response. "I already do a lot of game developing and I've sacrificed some sleep sometimes," he said, "but perhaps if I were to have a choice, I would like to focus in on the game development design."</p>
<p>Yoshida is best known for his work on Final Fantasy 14, but in recent years has been pulled into other projects. Yoshida heads up Square Enix's Creative Business Unit 3, responsible for the MMORPG as well as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-xvi">Final Fantasy 16</a> and the forthcoming <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-tactics">Final Fantasy Tactics</a>: The Ivalice Chronicles. He was also co-producer on Fantasian: Neo Dimension.</p>
<p>In another interview at Pax West, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-14s-naoki-yoshida-wants-players-to-stop-sending-developers-demoralising-abuse">Yoshida requested players stop sending developers demoralising abuse</a>.</p>
<p>"I want to emphasise here, there is a person behind the games," he said. "While I understand some harsh criticism might be necessary sometimes, there's a person behind the games that you enjoy and if you have that harsh criticism, I think we would want to have it be constructive.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>I am exhausted this week, and that’s only slightly because I’ve repeatedly been up until the wee hours of the morning playing a bunch of video games for review. Chief among them has been <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/09/17/frostpunk-2-console-review/">Frostpunk 2</a> on console, which is such an incredible game, made only slightly more annoying by playing with a controller. Other than that, I didn’t really get on with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/09/18/sonic-racing-crossworlds-review/">Sonic Racing: Crossworlds</a>, which feels lacking the same soul as previous Sonic kart racers, but I’ve quietly enjoyed <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/09/19/formula-legends-review/">Formula Legends</a>, even if it is a bit limited.</p>

<p><strong>Steve</strong> has played the slightly worrying heading to the hospital for an op game, but has happily come out the other side of it, and his nose only flashed a couple of times so the doctor probably did a fairly good job. He told us, “I’ve got back into Breath of Fire II on my Retroid and really enjoying the benefits of a fast-forward feature for the random battles.” Besides that, he’s hoping to get back to reviewing, at least as soon as he can sit in a chair again.</p>
<p><strong>Aran</strong> is working on Ghost of Yotei, and that’s literally all he’s allowed to say about that, so we’ll move on to <strong>Jim</strong> finished Sword of the Sea, saying, “It offers some great visual set pieces but little in the way of compelling gameplay as you cruise around levels, interacting with the occasional node to make water (and marine life) suddenly appear. I was left a little disappointed, as I was expecting something more in line with The Pathless, or even an evolution of that format.”</p>
<p><strong>Nic B</strong> has been playing Final Fantasy Tactics: Chronicles of Ivalice for review, and you can find out what he thinks about that next Wednesday. While that’s been going on, <strong>Jason</strong> has been playing a lot of Borderlands 4, saying, “I’ve managed to not experience any bugs, and am really enjoying it. It’s a bit leap from previous games, and with more fluid movement and a strong roster of Vault Hunters and NPCs, it’s just a really good time all around.”</p>


<p>Next up was Ade, telling us that “between bouts of Marvel Rivals I played <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/09/18/towa-and-the-guardians-of-the-sacred-tree-review/">Towa and the Guardians of the Sacred Tree</a> for review, which offers a surprisingly innovative take on the standard Hades formula. Also, I’ve spent a frankly shocking amount of my overall leisure time painting my Castigator battle tank for Warhammer 40k!”</p>
<p><strong>Gamoc</strong> has played <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/09/18/dying-light-the-beast-review/">Dying Light The Beast</a>, Discounty, and Rise of Industry for review. That’s not all though, as he’s been watching Blippo+ which he says is, “Indescribable”.</p>

<p>Continuing the slate of upcoming reviews, <strong>Laura</strong> has been solving all the mysteries this week: a bit of murder in Egypt in the 70’s alongside Poirot in her review of Agatha Christie’s Death on the Nile, and solving all sorts of haunting cases in 17th century New England in Banishers Ghosts of New Eden!</p>
<p>It’s been a busy week for <strong>Tuffcub</strong>, who’s been playing the immersive sim “I have a real job again”. He says, “While it’s interesting and I am enjoying wandering through the realistic render of Canary Wharf, I kinda miss just getting up, walking doggos, writing music and not having to care about anything. Will be seeking out the Sugar Daddy DLC pack so I can return to that.”</p>
<p>And finally,&nbsp;what has <strong>Tef</strong> played? Well, there was some Strange Antiquities for review later today, a brief refresher of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/09/18/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-preview-torpor-less-in-seattle/">Vampire: The Masquerade – Bloodlines 2</a> for his Gamescom preview, and he finished a jaunt through the DLC for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/09/16/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-the-order-of-giants-whips-up-a-mini-matinee-adventure/">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a>, which was a nice bitesized adventure.</p>
<p>What about you, what have you played this week?</p>

		<p>Developer Spooky Doorway and publisher Raw Fury have confirmed that the supernatural detective mystery The Séance of Blake Manor will launch on October 27th for PC. Just in time for Halloween. The release date was confirmed during the Convergence Games Showcase, where a brand new trailer was also shown.</p>
<p><iframe title="The Séance of Blake Manor | Release Date Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ATH_4Ea5O6s?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Set in Ireland in the year 1897, players take on the role of Detective Declan Ward who has been summoned to solve the case of the disappearance of Evelyn Deane. The case is going to be tough especially when it is Halloween, you are surrounded by mystics gathered for a séance, and the unexplainable situations that plague the investigation. The gameplay consists of speaking to the other people gathered on the island, observing the events that are taking place, and being in the right place at the right time. Time is not a luxury Declan has due to the guests going about their day, so if you are not in certain places you may miss vital evidence that could help solve the case.</p>
<h2><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/07/03/the-seance-of-blake-manor-channels-classic-detective-tales-with-an-irish-supernatural-twist/">The Séance of Blake Manor channels classic detective tales with an Irish supernatural twist</a></h2>
<p>In our preview of The Séance of Blake Manor, Stefan wrote, <em>“Having such a broad cast of characters to investigate, it will be fascinating to see how this gels with the game’s time limit. Certainly, there’s an implication from my brief game over that you need to not only save Miss Deane, but also save people from attending the séance. This is absolutely one to watch for fans of mysteries and puzzles.”</em></p>

There was really only one way to enhance the prospect of an Antarctic open world game with a choice of playable penguins that's actually a fractious retelling of Lovecraft's Mountains of Madness, created by the developers of Umurangi Generation. And that one way was to <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/veselekov.bsky.social/post/3lz56tdcfg22z">hire Lenval Brown</a>, narrator for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/disco-elysium">Disco Elysium</a>'s special edition, to voice the first proper trailer. And also, make the trailer look a lot like John Carpenter's The Thing. No further words from me are needed or desired. Find the footage below.

So be it! <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/whats-next-for-the-umurangi-generation-devs-why-a-game-about-penguins-and-people-going-mad-on-a-mountain-of-course">Announced in June</a>, Penguin Colony is a short narrative adventure in which an explorer thrown outside Time by the Old Ones seeks aid by possessing or manipulating the local penguins. You will slide and slip around the surface of the bergs and also, travel deep beneath the ice, which is generally not a great place to be in anything Lovecraftian.
</p>
<p>
This being a game from the people behind Umurangi Generation, a brilliant political artwork which <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/i-cant-stop-snapping-umurangi-generations-dazzling-jet-set-radio-cityscape">deals in themes of decolonization from the perspective of a Māori shutterbug</a>, I imagine there will be some critique of Lovecraft's notions about foreign parts and people. I don't have the linguistic knowledge to confirm this, but based on some quick online research, part of the trailer also appears to be voiced in Māori.
</p><p>
The last penguin game I had the pleasure of was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/faaast-penguin">Faaast Penguin</a>, which Brendy (RPS in peace) <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/faaast-penguin-is-that-super-mario-64-level-where-you-race-a-penguin-except-now-the-penguin-is-39-other-players">summarised</a> as "that Super Mario 64 level where you race a penguin except now the penguin is 39 other players". There are no Old Ones in Faaast Penguin, but it did launch <em>almost exactly a year ago to the day</em> - a temporal alignment that surely reflects the dire intervention of some cosmic Cthulhuin or Penghulu, tracing cryptic sentences with its immense pygostyle (tail bone) upon the snows of unreality. 
</p>
<p>
While researching penguin anatomy in order to construct that stupid skit about the penguin god, I discovered that a "penguin diagram" is also <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Penguin_diagram">some kind of quantum field McGuffin</a> referring to the "flavours" of "quarks". Coincidence? None of this is coincidence, foolish child! The universe is ending and Lenval Brown is here to preside over the collapse. Let's see if we can distil any further cortex-flensing insight from the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3695930/Penguin_Colony/">Steam page</a>.
</p>
<p>
"Unlock different penguins to replay the game as," it comments. "Different penguins have different abilities and challenges. For example playing as a baby penguin means you can fit in smaller gaps but you cannot swim."
</p>
<p>
Well, that seems harmless enough. Please try to distract yourself from the coming doom by telling me which is your favourite penguin. If you wrote anything other than Rockhopper then sorry, you are wrong. Alternatively, exacerbate your awareness of the coming doom by rewatching <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAoONl2P8fw">Thingu</a>.

		<p>The most premium of games which is only for premium players, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/borderlands-4/">Borderlands 4</a>, is absolutely great and there’s nothing wrong with it, it’s your PC that’s rubbish and you don’t know how to configure it. That’s what <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/09/16/randy-pitchford-reminds-you-that-borderlands-4-is-a-premium-game-made-for-premium-gamers/">Randy Pritchford say</a>s so we can all ignore the statement released by Gearbox that states:</p>
<p>“We know some PC players are running into bugs and crashes. We hear you. Updates to improve stability and performance already started rolling out over the weekend and another is coming. This is our top priority.”</p>



<p data-start="0" data-end="456">Look, folks, let me tell you something very important about Borderlands 4—it runs beautifully.&nbsp; Everybody’s saying it’s one of the smoothest, most incredible games ever made. No performance issues, none. The people trying to say otherwise? Fake news. They’re the same people who always want to tear down great American entertainment, the same tired critics like Jimmy Kimmel, a bad man, who has been wrong about everything from the beginning. Believe me.</p>
<p data-start="458" data-end="780">Borderlands 4 is fast, it’s sharp, it looks amazing—better than anyone thought possible. The developers did a tremendous job, maybe the best job ever. Everybody’s talking about how great it feels, how stable it is, how much fun they’re having. And you know what? They’re right. Because it works perfectly. Zero problems.</p>

<p data-start="782" data-end="1180" data-is-last-node="" data-is-only-node="">The fake news media doesn’t want you to enjoy it, they want to make up stories about “frame drops” or “performance problems.” Total lies. Don’t believe them. Ask the gamers, ask the fans—they’ll tell you the truth. Borderlands 4 is a massive success, running flawlessly, and people are loving it more than ever before. It’s a big, beautiful win. And we’re not going to let fake news take that away.</p>
<p data-start="782" data-end="1180" data-is-last-node="" data-is-only-node="">You know me, I like a border, big beautiful borders with big fences and to keep the robotic pyschos out of my game. We need more Borderlands like this because it’s the biggliest and best Borderlands ever.</p>

		<p>A new video for Football Manager 26 has been released by Sports Interactive, and the core subject is the introduction of women’s football to the series. The video shows how Sports Interactive has incorporated women’s football into Football Manager, confirming there will be 14 leagues across 11 countries with WSL and WSL2 among those leagues. Women’s football has been fully integrated into the game, allowing players to have both men and women’s league active in their games, or you can choose to play either men’s football or women’s football only.</p>
<p><iframe title="Football Manager 26 | Introducing Women's Football" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zjJ39Hd-O-I?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The women’s football database will include over 40,000 players as well, making it the biggest women’s football database in any game. Women’s player stats are equivalent to the men’s stats, but also within the context of the women’s game. Sports Interactive has gone further with animations with women footballers being used to motion capture movements, so the on the pitch action resembles close to the reality of how women play football. Sports Interactive has also confirmed that this is just the first step for women’s football in the Football Manager series, with the database set to expand and the experience to get more depth in the future.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/09/10/football-manager-26-releases-on-november-4th/">Sports Interactive recently confirmed that Football Manager 26 releases on November 4th</a> for PC, PS5, Xbox Series XS, Game Pass, and mobile exclusively through Netflix. Football Manager 26 Touch will launch on December 4th for Switch.</p>

            <p>To invert or not to invert? The question of whether to flip the Y-axis in games is often answered with recollections of childhood habits and/or varyingly smug declarations of which joystick setting is 'better'. Now, though, a cognitive research study posits that our control preferences are less about whether or not we played GoldenEye after school and more about the innate quirks of our brains.</p>
<p>As reported by Keith Stuart at <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/games/2025/sep/18/why-do-some-gamers-invert-their-controls-scientists-now-have-answers-but-theyre-not-what-you-think">The Guardian</a>, Dr Jennifer Corbett and Dr Jaap Munneke’s <a href="https://cognitiveresearchjournal.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s41235-025-00626-5">paper</a> 'Why axis inversion? Optimizing interactions between users, interfaces, and visual displays in 3D environments' details their experiments into control inversion choices. After answering a questionnaire about whether and why they think they use invert controls or not, participants were tasked to, as Corbett puts it, "mentally rotate random shapes, take on the perspective of an 'avatar' object in a picture, determine which way something was tilted in differently tilted backgrounds, and overcome the typical '<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/neuroscience/simon-effect">Simon effect</a>' where it’s harder to respond when a target is on the opposite v the same side of the screen as the response button."</p>
<p>These experiments, the study claims, indicated that none of the participants’ stated reasons for rejecting or embracing inversion "had anything to do" with their actual choice. "It turns out," Corbett says, "the most predictive out of all the factors we measured was how quickly gamers could mentally rotate things and overcome the Simon effect. The faster they were, the less likely they were to invert. People who said they sometimes inverted were by far the slowest on these tasks."</p>
<p>Or, as Stuart puts it, "It’s much more likely that you invert or don’t invert due to how your brain perceives objects in 3D space." And the speed factor doesn’t mean that electing to invert is a skill issue either, as the study adds that while non-inverters would flip their images at a faster pace, they’d make more mistakes than the cautious inverters, resulting in an overall equal accuracy rate.</p>

<p>I suspect my C grade in GCSE Biology isn’t quite enough to let me give a learned interpretation of these findings, but it sure sounds like the desire to invert is based mainly on unconscious brainworkings – hardly sure footing for any "No, MY way is better" reasoning. Though on a personal level it’s nice to know, as someone who’s always inverted the Y axis on thumbstick controls but can’t remember a reason why, that I don’t actually <em>need</em> a reason. It’s just how I perceive objects in 3D space, guys. I shall continue to go around gaming trade shows, flipping the sticks at all the demo booths and forgetting to reset them, thus leaving a trail of harmless inconveniences like a hallway full of slightly tilted paintings. And it’ll all be fine, because it was basically an accident of birth.</p><p>Then again, the study doesn’t entirely reject the impact of learned behaviour, and in fact suggests we try practicing the opposite of our control preference – just in case we’ve convinced ourselves to stick with a method that isn't a cognitive match.</p>
<p>"Non-inverters should give inversion a try – and inverters should give non-inversion another shot," Corbett argues. "You might even want to force yourself to stick with it for a few hours. People have learned one way. That doesn’t mean they won’t learn another way even better.</p>
<p>"A good example is being left-handed. Until the mid-20th century, left-handed children were forced to write with their right hand, causing some people to have lifelong handwriting difficulties and learning problems. Many older adults still don’t realise they’re naturally left-handed and could write/draw much better if they switched back."</p>
<p>Sometimes, when I’m running a quick test of something on the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-steam-deck-games">Steam Deck</a>, I leave the Y-axis uninverted just because I can’t be bothered to delve into the menus to change it. Does that count?</p>
