<figure data-uuid="4dae6d8a5f80d"><a title="Baldur's Gate 3 Shadowheart" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/4dae6d8a5f80d/baldurs-gate-3-shadowheart.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Larian Studios</em></figcaption></figure><p>Of all the dream Nintendo Switch 2 ports, <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/baldurs_gate_3">Baldur's Gate 3</a> is probably extremely high on many people's lists. It certainly is on ours too! But that pipe dream may have to stay as just that — a pipe dream.</p>
<p>Larian Studios, the developer behind the GOTY winning RPG from 2023, held a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1q870w5/larian_studios_divinity_ama/?sort=qa">Reddit AMA</a> earlier today mainly focusing on its upcoming <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/divinity">Divinity</a> title, which was revealed at The Game Awards 2025. And, as you'd expect, one fan asked about the potential of a Switch 2 port of the latest Baldur's Gate game.</p><div><figure data-videoid="nq-wlNfCGDw" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nq-wlNfCGDw?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytnq-wlNfCGDw" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/nq-wlNfCGDw?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/nq-wlNfCGDw?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed7bb9d0hmivtp&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>841k</span></a></p>

<p>When asked if a port is even possible, Larian CEO <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1q870w5/comment/nylkog6/">Swin Vincke's response</a> was disappointing and a little vague: "We would have loved to but it wasn't our decision to make."</p>
<p>So, were their plans to make this happen, and if so, who could have got in the way? Would Nintendo refuse the game? Unlikely, we think. The only possible answer we can think of is Dungeons &amp; Dragons publishers and IP owners Hasbro and Wizards of the Coast.</p>
<p>It seems like a strange decision either way — Baldur's Gate 3 is primed for success on the new console. And, of course, this response might mean nothing. We're still going to hope <em>something</em> changes.</p>
<p>On more positive news, regarding that new Divinity game, Larian is potentially considering a Switch 2 version of that title. Another user asked about this while praising the recent <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/divinity-original-sin-2-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Divinity: Original Sin 2</a> Switch 2 upgrade, which came out in December 2025.</p>
<figure data-uuid="bdd1acc0308f4"><a title="Divinity Announcement trailer screenshot" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/bdd1acc0308f4/divinity-announcement-trailer-screenshot.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Larian Studios</em></figcaption></figure>
<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1q870w5/comment/nylf8qz/?context=3">Technical director Bert replied</a>: "We love the platform and we will certainly consider Switch 2 for the next Divinity game." So it sounds like the Switch 2 is firmly on the mind for the team at Larian.</p>
<p>We can only hope at this stage that one, or both games, make it to the system. But Divinity is likely a while away, while Baldur's Gate 3... well, anything could happen there.</p>
<p>Larian announced this AMA back in December following the reveal of Divinity and an interview with <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-12-16/-baldur-s-gate-3-maker-promises-divinity-will-be-next-level">Bloomberg</a>, where Vincke revealed the team were using generative AI for generating ideas, concept art, PowerPoint presentations, and more.</p>
<p>In this AMA, Vincke seems to have changed his stance on AI use, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1q870w5/comment/nyl9tdz/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">stating</a> "there is not going to be any GenAI art in Divinity." That's good news.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/the-division-3-in-production-will-have-as-big-an-impact-as-division-1-ubisoft-massive/</link>
            <guid>1401976</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/the-division-3-announced-star-wars-outlaws-director-julian-gerighty/">It's been over two years since <strong>Ubisoft Massive</strong> confirmed</a> that it would be making <strong>The Division 3</strong>, and that series creator<strong> Julian Gerighty</strong> would be at the forefront of the project. Since then, Ubisoft has released <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-division-2-battle-for-brooklyn-dlc-launches-on-may-27/">major updates and expansions for The Division 2</a>, and at <a href="https://wccftech.com/topic/gamescom/">Gamescom 2025</a>, we even got a major reveal of what the company has planned for the franchise, with a new survival extraction game called The Division 2: Survivors and an upcoming mobile MMO title called The Division Resurgence.</p>



<p>As for The Division 3? Ubisoft did not mention it at the time, but during yesterday's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gDt-guVbQMs">New Game Plus Showcase,</a> when Gerighty was showcasing and discussing The Division 2: Survivors, he also answered a question regarding The Division 3.</p>



<p>While he couldn't say much beyond the fact that the game is still coming and a confirmation that it is in production, he does set the expectation bar quite high for what players can look forward to.</p>



<p>"<em>So, The Division 3 is in production, right? This is not a secret; it's been announced. It's shaping up to be a monster</em>. <em>I can't really say anything more than that. But this is, within these walls, in Massive, we are working extremely hard on something that I think will be as big an impact as Division 1 was</em>."</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="The Division 2 Developer Interview | New Game+ Showcase 2026" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GE_C1ueUnss?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Ultimately, Gerighty isn't saying too much, and he quickly moves on to continue talking about Survivors and Resurgence, since those are the two projects that he was technically supposed to be talking about. But as you'll see from the first few comments under the interview, players were more pleased to just have a few new words on The Division 3. </p>



<p>Hopefully, these aren't the last words we hear on the game before 2026 is done. <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/tom-clancys-the-division-2-loot-capital/">The Division 2</a></strong> will officially be seven years old when we get to March 12, 2026, and while Ubisoft Massive has done a great job in maintaining the third-person shooter and updating it with new content, for two, arguably three of those last seven years, all players have wanted to see is a third mainline entry in the franchise.</p>



<p>We likely won't get it in 2026, but hopefully, we'll know to expect it for 2027.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The boss behind the studio that developed one of 2025’s best RPGs, <em><a href="https://kotaku.com/kingdom-come-swen-vincke-larian-bruce-straley-ai-warhorse-2000654591">Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2</a>,</em> says that online controversies about the game and its predecessor involving representation likely didn’t hurt the game’s sales and only mattered to “a handful” of people who are online 24/7.</p> <p>Some quick history. <a href="https://kotaku.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-the-kotaku-review-1823606430">In 2017, in the lead-up to the launch of </a><em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance,</em> developer Warhorse Studios was criticized by some online for not including people of color in the game. The studio defended this by claiming it was <a href="https://kotaku.com/kingdom-come-owes-its-popularity-to-realism-and-conserv-1823420208">historically accurate</a> that in early 15th-century Bohemia, especially in the countryside where the game was set, it was rare to see non-white people. Some scholars agreed, others weren’t sure, and people online yelled about it, with some right-leaning gamers very invested in protecting the studio from the “woke agenda.” Fast forward to 2025, when a lot of the people who had previously defended Warhorse’s dedication to historical accuracy were now mad that the studio was including more people of color. The studio explained that it made sense as the sequel involved a large city that would have brought in more people from around the world. There were also some folks angry about the ability to have a gay relationship.</p>

 <p>So, did any of this controversy affect the game sales? <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/rpg/attacks-on-kingdom-come-deliverance-for-gay-romance-representation-only-mattered-to-a-handful-of-terminally-online-culture-warriors-reckons-kcd2s-exec-producer-and-probably-didnt-impact-the-games-reception/">That’s what <em>PC Gamer</em> recently asked</a> Martin Klíma, Warhorse’s co-founder and the executive producer on <em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2.&nbsp;</em></p> <p>“I would really, really like to know the answer to this one. You can really convincingly argue both ways,” Klíma told the outlet. “You can convincingly argue that we got some extra visibility—that it doesn’t matter what they say about you, as long as they spell your name right.” At the same time, he said, you could argue that “any controversy is hurtful, and you want to speak about the game, and you don’t want to explain some…tangled reasoning.”</p>

 <p>Klíma further explained that he personally felt that the online controversies surrounding both games “only mattered to, really, a handful of terminally online culture warriors” and believed that they are “an insignificant intersection with the gaming public writ large.”</p>

 <p>“The real players really don’t care about it at all, and probably most of them never really even heard about these pseudo-controversies,” said Klíma.</p> <p>Considering the fact that <em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance</em> has sold over 10 million copies since 2017, and that its sequel has already sold over four million, I think Klíma might be right. It’s a good reminder that most people aren’t online as much as your favorite journalists, content creators, or posters. That’s not to say they don’t care about things like representation, but they aren’t really hearing about most of this stuff, and instead are just buying that game that people said was good or that has a cool cover. Honestly, I’m jealous.</p>

"This is the year of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/clair-obscur-expedition-33-sales-5m-update" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="a11aa258-e2c1-48df-ac44-95f3a37e9c4a" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">our lord and savior</a> <em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em>! Surely it is the single greatest year in the history of interactive media, and thus are you branded a heretic for your divergence from scripture."</p><p>Reader, <em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 </em>left me not just cold, but frozen thanks to its ending, and while I'm sure I just didn't understand it because it was actually very clever and well-constructed, I have no interest in revisiting the game to confirm or deny that.</p><p>Thankfully, I managed to find five other games to keep me warm during that cold snap, so here, in tantalizingly reverse order, are my top 5 games of 2025!</p><h2>Honorable Mentions</h2><p>If I may, I'd like to start with a couple of games that just about didn't make the grade. I won't take much of your time with these, but I wanted to nod in their general direction without officially numbering them.</p><ul><li><em>Look Outside</em>. Very strong horror theming and non-linear exploration, but the combat's just a little too basic for my tastes.</li><li><em>Hades II</em>. The gameplay is complex and exciting, and there's loads to do, so it's a shame the story is terrible.</li><li><em>The Alters</em>. I found <em>The Alters</em>' core gameplay stressful and just a little dull, which is a shame because the story is superb. It's the inverse <em>Hades II </em>problem.</li></ul><p>Right, that's that out of the way. Here are the real heavy hitters!</p><h2>5. <em>Shinobi: Art of Vengeance</em></h2><figure role="group">

  </article>

<figcaption>Yeah, yeah, alright. It's good.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>It would be churlish not to acknowledge one of the biggest and most generous Metroidvania platformers ever created on this list, even if I do have some issues with wonky storytelling and some questionable difficulty choices.</p><p><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/hollow-knight-silksong" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="e6454f0b-6800-4e17-96eb-7c686c1e2c90" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow"><em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em></a><em> </em>is, to put it simply, the platformer that keeps on giving. Like its predecessor, it keeps going when you think it surely must have run out of ideas, and then it tacks on entire extra areas and bosses after that as well.</p><p><em>Silksong </em>also represents a level up for Team Cherry's already drum skin-tight combat design; Hornet is an acrobatic protagonist, and she's an absolute thrill to control as she bounces and weaves her way through Pharloom's many and varied denizens.</p><p>Much like <em>Hades II</em>, however, things come apart for me in the story stakes. <em>Silksong</em>'s narrative is unfocused and sprawling, and it never quite coalesces around an identifiable goal, nor does it succeed in making Hornet feel like a genuine character for me.</p><p>I'm also not sure <em>Silksong </em>needed to be quite so frustrating. Some of its boss runs are <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/opinions/death-to-death-runs" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="bc88c70a-a511-49c5-9fc0-4b3f70907424" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">a little patience-testing</a>, and while its encounters feel perfectly tuned to me, one or two of its nastier surprises feel unfair rather than punishing.</p><p>With all that said, <em>Silksong </em>is a superb sequel to <em>Hollow Knight</em>, and I look forward to knitting my broken fingers back together to play its upcoming free expansion.</p><h2>3. <em>The Roottrees Are Dead</em></h2><figure role="group">

<figcaption>Do you like genealogy puzzlers? <em>The Roottrees Are Dead </em>is for you.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Representing an extremely strong start to the year, <em>The Roottrees Are Dead </em>is exactly what I think deductive puzzle games should be, which is to say it's inspired by <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/return-of-obra-dinn" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="cf4c55bd-209b-4472-8975-e018955d838d" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow"><em>Return of the Obra Dinn</em></a>.</p><p>Tasking you with sorting through a tangled web of genealogy in order to uncover the secrets of a family of candy magnates, <em>The Roottrees Are Dead </em>isn't particularly flashy or sexy, but it is rich with puzzle goodness.</p><p>Discovering the identity of a particularly elusive family member by digging through periodicals and books might not sound like your idea of fun, but it's certainly mine, so I for one am grateful to Evil Trout.</p><p>In an era of AAA games treating players like complete morons (looking at you, <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/metroid-prime-4" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="c195faed-5d46-484c-bbea-f034fca5544b" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow"><em>Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</em></a>), <em>The Roottrees Are Dead </em>represents a refreshing and exciting trend towards do-it-yourself puzzle-solving, and I'm very much here for it.</p><p>The art is a little uncanny at times, and it's true that there's no pulse-pounding action or multi-stage boss fight to captivate adrenaline junkies, but <em>The Roottrees Are Dead </em>thrilled me thoroughly, so onto the list it goes.</p><h2>2. <em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em></h2><figure role="group">
<article>
  
      
  

  </article>

<figcaption><em>Donkey Kong Bananza </em>shows Nintendo's innovative spirit isn't dead.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Yes, yes, alright. I'm a Nintendo shill, I admit it. Still, there were very few games that matched <em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em>'s sheer joie de vivre and inventive spirit for me this year.</p><p>Okay, so DK's latest adventure can sometimes feel like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/donkey-kong-bananza-super-mario-odyssey-team" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="95f40f3e-5162-45ed-8871-019d18466db6" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">a reskin (presumably a banana skin) of <em>Super Mario Odyssey</em></a>, and the dynamic between Donkey Kong and his young charge Pauline is odd, to say the least.</p><p>None of that changes the fact that Nintendo is still creating best-in-class platformers, and that <em>Donkey Kong Bananza </em>represents a thrilling demonstration of the legendary Japanese company's design chops.</p><p>Even without DK's ability to tunnel through levels, thus skipping entire platforming challenges and causing potentially devastating sequence breaks, <em>Bananza</em>'s many and varied challenges would be the cherry on top of the chef's kiss, as it were.</p><p>Taken with its innovative <em>Minecraft</em>-style digging systems, though, <em>Bananza</em>'s responsive platforming and wealth of diverse levels made it a joy to play through. I'm not collecting every banana, though. That way madness lies.</p><h2>1. <em>Blue Prince</em></h2><figure role="group">
<article>
  
      
  

  </article>

<figcaption><em>Blue Prince </em>has its flaws, but it's just so gosh-darn interesting.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Dogubomb and Raw Fury released roguelite adventure puzzler <em>Blue Prince </em>in April, and not only was it easily the highlight of that month for me, it was also easily the year's best, with a couple of heavy caveats.</p><p>Let's get this one out of the way first: yes, the RNG is a problem. It's baked into <em>Blue Prince</em>'s design, so I can't think of a way to fix it, but having a puzzle most of the way solved only to repeatedly fail to get the room you need can be aggravating.</p><p>Despite that, though, <em>Blue Prince</em>'s mixture of randomized room-laying and puzzle-solving that stretches across multiple runs absolutely captivated me this year.</p><p>Between this and <em>Roottrees</em>, 2025 really was the year of retrieving an actual pen and notepad with which to make notes (I also thoroughly enjoyed <em>Lorelei and the Laser Eyes </em>this year, but I'm restricting myself to 2025 releases for this list).</p><p>As well as the wealth of puzzles to solve, <em>Blue Prince </em>also has a story to discover, and it's told out of order, so you'll need to be paying attention if you want to piece together what happened in this cozy but deceptively complex world.</p><p>I won't deny that <em>Blue Prince </em>frustrated me at times, but it's still my game of the year simply for its uniqueness and experimentation. I'd rather play a single <em>Blue Prince </em>than a thousand <em>Ghost of Yotei</em>s (<em>Ghosts of Yotei</em>?).</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>While 2025 was a relatively tame year when it came to AAA game releases, there were still plenty of standout titles if you knew where to look. <em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em> of course was the breakout hit of the year, definitively proving that you don't really need 20 different studios and billions of dollars to deliver a top-tier experience.&nbsp;</p><p>Naturally, the success of one game isn't indicative of an upheaval in the entire industry. However, between the apparent stagnation of old guard studios, the rapid maturation of Chinese gaming studios as a whole, and the proliferation of new software that enables smaller teams to pump out competitive titles, 2026 may be a very interesting year in terms of both individual games and the industry at large.</p><h2><em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em></h2><picture>

  </picture><p>What else can be said about <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/clair-obscur-expedition-33-review-french-revolution" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow"><em>Expedition 33</em></a> that hasn't already been said by others? If you're a fan, or have even a passing interest in turn-based RPGs and you have the time to try the game, you should.&nbsp;</p><p>While the idea of implementing action-game mechanics into a turn-based RPG isn't new, <em>Expedition 33</em> does it so flawlessly that it sets a new standard for the genre. Throw in some excellent music and writing with some very creative world design and it's no surprise that it's one of the more undisputed Game of the Year contenders in recent memory.</p><p>On a small side note, I personally quite like the default skins of the playable characters. They all have similar uniforms with a very neat color scheme, but with just enough personalization that you can tell who is who with a mere glance. Given the context of the expeditions, it seems like a logical and practical choice, and it's a small deviation from the norm of every party member having completely different clothing and armor.</p><p>There are two small quibbles I have with <em>Expedition 33</em> though in that it seems like no matter what language you play on, the lip syncing seems to be just a little bit off. The second is that the jumping animation is a little stiff. Yet these are such a relatively minor issues in an otherwise excellent game.</p><h2><em>Doom: The Dark Ages</em></h2><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/doom-the-dark-ages-mech_0.jpg?itok=3FK3KbBh 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1920" height="1080">
              <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/doom-the-dark-ages-mech_0.jpg?itok=zgwYi9QC 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1200" height="675">
                  

  </picture><p>Sequels to first-person shooters tend to be rather hit or miss in my experience and thankfully, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/doom-dark-ages-review" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="6c34b81d-7c3a-4488-97a7-1de8454240f4" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow"><em>Doom: The Dark Ages</em></a> delivers more of the former than the latter. While the changes to <em>Doom's</em> core gameplay formula took a little bit to get used to, the shield and all of its abilities opens up so many more venues for violence that it's hard to see it as anything but an upgrade.</p><p>The shift from a sci-fi setting to a more fantasy-inspired backdrop was a great idea though. There have been a million and one interpretations of what humanity in space might look like, yet there are only so many games that take medieval design and decide to use that as a starting point for a sci-fi society.</p><p>Unfortunately, the new mech and dragon levels kind of just exist. They're a step up from those on-rails segments that were in every FPS decades ago, although in practice they're fundamentally identical. Simply put, if there was any real disappointment to be found in <em>Doom: The Dark Ages</em>, it's that the on-foot combat is somehow more visceral and more dynamic than flying a dragon with guns or piloting a huge mech.&nbsp;</p><h2><em>Ninja Gaiden 4</em></h2><picture>

  </picture><p>After so many years it's nice to see one of original "git gud" game franchises make a return in the modern era, and what a humbling return it is. The gameplay is ridiculously fast paced and the enemies aren't pulling their punches, even on normal difficulty. Miss a dodge and that random generic goon is taking off a big chunk of your health. Oh and there's usually several goons per encounter. The damage goes both ways though, and if you play correctly you can eviscerate bosses in mere minutes.&nbsp;</p><p>Admittedly, some of the difficulty comes from the camera and how it sometimes struggles to track enemies, but for the most part you really do have to just learn how to play. It's less "memorize these attack patterns and parry" and more "combo this guy out of existence before his friends spawn in," which I personally find to be more visually satisfying.&nbsp;</p><p>The injection of cyberpunk elements into the art direction of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/ninja-gaiden-4-review-blackened-rain-beckons" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="cd1796d1-2f9f-45e0-9bc3-182e5870632c" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow"><em>Ninja Gaiden 4</em></a> is quite neat too. There are chapters where you have a mix of contemporary, cyberpunk, and traditional/demonic themes playing off of each other and it's usually very well done.&nbsp;</p><h2><em>Where Winds Meet</em></h2><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/where-winds-meet-outpost.jpg?itok=uzmWUqAO 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1920" height="1080">

  </picture><p><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/where-winds-meet" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="09a36c6b-7807-494f-9194-2047bdcea2c4" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow"><em>Where Winds Meet</em></a> is one of those rare games that I would recommend solely for the world design and art direction. While countless games draw from European fantasy for their setting, <em>Where Winds Meet</em> stands out because it quite obviously inspired by Chinese fantasy. The broad strokes of both genres are actually quite similar in concept, although the latter typically involves things like using martial arts to throw bears around or flying through the air with special sword moves and such.&nbsp;</p><p>Thankfully, such physics-defying tropes are used sparingly in the main quest and are seemingly there mostly for exploration purposes. <em>Where Winds Meet</em> plays like any other action game with parry and dodge mechanics otherwise.&nbsp;</p><p>Your arsenal is quite unique though. You have access to your standard array of swords, spears, and bows, but you also have more atypical options like umbrellas and fans. Similarly, your "magic" options are to get drunk and fist fight your enemies, throw geese at people, meditate really hard to get a damage reduction buff, and other similar moves that don't usually appear in games.&nbsp;</p><p>Again, this ties into the aspect that sets <em>Where Winds Meet</em> apart from its competitors. Without the strong adherence to the Chinese fantasy art direction, you're left with a mechanically sound yet somewhat mundane action game.&nbsp;</p><h2><em>Persona 5: The Phantom X</em></h2><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/persona5x-trial.jpg?itok=_jruadxn 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1920" height="1200">
              <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/persona5x-trial.jpg?itok=vMrYWdhm 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1200" height="750">
                  

  </picture><p>While it's certainly not ideal that the latest <em>Persona </em>game is a spin-off of <em>Persona 5</em> but with gacha mechanics, credit should be given to the developers of <em>Persona 5: The Phantom X</em> for implementing a lot of features that demonstrably improve the classic Persona experience. The most obvious addition would be the inclusion of multiple adult confidants and playable characters of various ages, ranging from college students and young adults to senior citizens.</p><p>Another neat change is the modernization of various core gameplay mechanics. For instance, party roles are more strictly defined, so you might have characters that are specialized buffers or tanks. Personas have similar niches, so while you do have the freedom to build a Persona however you want, you're still encouraged to pick certain Personas based on what your team needs. Navigators also play a more active role in combat, functioning as a kind of off-screen support.&nbsp;</p><p>The most controversial changes might be the removal of the calendar system and some of the writing. The mere notion that you might miss relevant story content in previous Persona games due to the calendar was like a specter that haunted every dialogue decision that you could make, so I certainly didn't miss its absence.</p><p>Unfortunately, most everyone can agree that <em>Persona 5: The Phantom X's</em> story has a very weak opening act. While I like the first two antagonists on a conceptual level, the execution of these concepts in terms of both writing and presentation left much to be desired.</p><p>The narrative only starts to shine at the third Palace, which is much better executed thus far. While it's not quite on the level of Dr. Maruki's arc in <em>Persona 5 Royal</em>, it has the potential for greatness, and its themes are quite contemporary too.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>As the midway point of the 2020s, the year 2025 has given us some excellent games. This was a pinnacle year, with a major console release from Nintendo and so many developers focusing exclusively on current-gen hardware. It was also an incredible year for indies, giving me such a diverse field of games to play through.</p><p>Here are my top 10 games I played in 2025.</p><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/ghost-of-yotei-deer.JPG?itok=PdKlAb54 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1920" height="1080">
              <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/ghost-of-yotei-deer.JPG?itok=Th6Qq_Fl 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1200" height="675">
                  

  </picture><h2>1. <em>Ghost of Yotei&nbsp;</em> &nbsp;</h2><p>Easily my most-anticipated title, having loved<em> </em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/ghost-of-tsushima" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow"><em>Ghost of Tsushima</em></a> and wanting to spend more time in that beautiful world,<em> Ghost of Yotei </em>delighted me in every way. I actually like it better than its predecessor, with Atsu's story and character being more compelling to me personally.</p><p>Taking full advantage of PlayStation 5, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/ghost-of-yotei-review-new-ghost-in-familiar-tale" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow"><em>Ghost of Yotei</em></a><em> </em>brought to life a vibrant world packed with wildlife, side quests, shrines and adventures around every region. Plus, Atsu was able to shred Jin's sense of honor that permeated the <em>Ghost of Tsushima</em> story so heavily, removing a lot of the guilt her predecessor felt about his actions. This is my top game of the year and one that I look forward to jump back into when<em> Legends</em> releases later this year.</p><h2>2. <em>Metroid Prime 4&nbsp;</em></h2><p>Eight years in the making and 18 years since <em>Metroid Prime 3</em>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/metroid-prime-4" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow"><em>Metroid Prime 4</em></a> finally launched this past December, and I loved almost every minute of it. It sounds contradictory, but my least favorite thing about Metroidvania games is the actual Metroidvania part, so a more straightforward action-adventure experience like <em>Metroid Prime 4 </em>was perfect for me.</p><p>It also motivated me to launch a spreadsheet to log powerups and secret locations, a tactic I'll bring forward to other games that I may have bounced off of because of their complexity. Incredible boss battles and gorgeous art direction (Sol Valley notwithstanding) all combine brilliantly to make this one of my favorite games of the year.</p><h2>3. <em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em></h2><p><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/donkey-kong-bananza-review-oohh-banana" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow"><em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em></a> is currently one of the best Nintendo Switch 2 exclusives, and it does a brilliant job of showcasing what the Switch 2 is capable of. I spent countless hours exploring the levels as DK with Pauline by my side, punching through dirt, gravel, and any other material I came across.</p><p>It reminded me of everything I love about <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/minecraft" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow"><em>Minecraft</em></a> while combining the smooth platforming of a <em>Super Mario</em> game. Knowing that<em> Donkey Kong Bananza </em>came from the <em>Mario </em>team at Nintendo, it sets up great possibilities for what the future of platformers looks like on Switch 2.</p><h2>4. <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em></h2><p><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/monster-hunter-wilds" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow"><em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em></a> switches up some of the core formula of the franchise that not all friends appreciated, but I did. SOS flares and AI companions meant I could take on some of the more difficult battles without waiting for friends to be online, and the responsive controls on PS5 made combat an incredibly satisfying experience.</p><p>The monster designs in this game were some of my favorite in the series, and I found myself replaying battles over and over just because of how cinematic they felt, dodging lightning strikes or navigating sandstorms. <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em> helped turn me into a full <em>Monster Hunter</em> fan, and I'll always appreciate it for that.</p><h2>5. <em>Blue Prince</em></h2><p><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/blue-prince" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow"><em>Blue Prince</em></a> was a delightful surprise on Game Pass this year (before I cancelled my account due to price increases, but <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/opinions/xbox-game-pass-ultimate-price-increase" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">that's another article</a>). I did not think that an indie game about exploring an estate room by room would have resonated with me as well as it did, but it pulled me in right away.</p><p>Solving the mysteries of the mansion only brings up more questions, and finding ways to navigate away from dead-ends and store important items for future runs only made this game more addicting.<em> Blue Prince</em> is a title I'll happily return to again and again to uncover more mysteries.</p><h2>6. <em>Split Fiction</em></h2><p>I had the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/split-fiction-review-everything-everywhere" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow"><em>Split Fiction</em></a> release date on my calendar for months, as my wife and I were so excited to play it together. When it launched in March, we had an incredible time working together to clear the puzzles and challenges of this game. Hazelight Studios deploys some of the best couch co-op experiences in gaming, and <em>Split Fiction </em>hits the mark just as well as its previous titles.</p><p>We found ourselves laughing and screaming in surprise as the many, many diverse gameplay vignettes played out during our time. I loved playing <em>Split Fiction</em> with my partner, and I have plans soon to start a new run-through with one of my best friends—I can't wait to experience this game again.</p><picture>

  </picture><h2>7. <em>Pokémon Legends Z-A</em></h2><p>Is there a title this year that received more negative criticism than <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/pokemon-legends-za-review-mega-adventure" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow"><em>Pokémon Legends Z-A</em></a><em>? </em>The initial discourse made me avoid it for a few weeks, but the night before boarding a plane to Las Vegas I decided to download it and play it during my vacation, and I'm so happy I did.</p><p><em>Pokémon Legends Z-A </em>combines a beautiful world (yes, even with 2D balconies) with impressively smooth gameplay, giving longtime fans a <em>Pokémon </em>experience worthy of a mainline title. Lumiose City was so much fun to get lost in, and battling through the ranks and discovering new Pokémon in the Wild Zones never got boring. <em>Pokémon Legends Z-A</em> gives me great hope for what the future of the <em>Pokémon </em>franchise holds for Switch 2 players.&nbsp;</p><h2>8. <em>Arc Raiders</em></h2><p><em>Arc Raiders </em>dominated my fall by not just being a great game, but it was a phenomenal multiplayer experience that reconnected me with some friends as we went raiding together. The short mission structure and variety of weapon upgrades and crafting options made the hours in this game easily tick away.</p><p>I found myself up late many nights jumping into raid after raid, checking my notes to hunt specific enemies for parts and making split-second decisions to engage or run away when confronted with human fighters. <em>Arc Raiders</em> satisfies with a near-perfect gameplay and level-up system, solidifying it as a game that I'll love to play for a long time to come.</p><h2>9. <em>Marvel's Midnight Suns</em></h2><p>Not a 2025 release, but this was the year I dove back into <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/marvels-midnight-suns-review" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow"><em>Marvel's Midnight Suns</em></a>. I had played a bit of it when it first came out but decided to pick it back up on Steam Deck. I was pleased to see how well it performs on the portable PC, allowing me to chip away at battles and build relationships while on lunch breaks, traveling, and relaxing on the couch.</p><p>This has become my bedtime game, treating it like a comic book that I jump into each night to hang out with Blade, Captain Marvel, Spider-Man, and all the others. <em>Marvel's Midnight Suns</em> is a slow-burn for me, and the perfect pace for a game to play in-between the other heavy-hitting titles I pick up throughout the year.</p><h2>10. <em>Alan Wake 2</em></h2><p>I initially started <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/alan-wake-2-review-mesmerizing-murder-mystery" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow"><em>Alan Wake 2</em></a> this fall to coincide with the Halloween season, and it was the perfect spooky game to play late at night as the days got shorter.<em> Alan Wake 2</em> combines everything I love about survival horror and mystery, giving you a fun assortment of weapons and upgrades, as well as impressively designed locales to explore.</p><p>After about 20 years in games, I found myself turning down some of the jump-scare settings, an element I was pleased to be able to control as they were starting to hurt my experience. Saga is one of my favorite new characters I got to play as this year, and no game has accomplished flashlight-wielding and gunplay quite like <em>Alan Wake 2 </em>has—this game was definitely a major highlight of mine this year.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Gaming in 2025 was arguably the most difficult it has ever been. Hardware and software prices are increasing due to illegal tariffs and unethical AI datacenters. High-profile releases appear to be charging more and providing less. Smaller studios that push the envelope struggle for the spotlight. This year, more than others, gaming was a struggle both as players and creators.</p><p>Yet, pleasant surprises did happen this year. Thoughtful, thematically rich, and downright delightful games broke through the haze of tumult, and I would like to share them here. These are my top 10 games of 2025.</p><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/total-chaos-twisted-hallway-image.jpg?itok=EBqwzBk7 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1400" height="788">

  </picture><h2>10.<em> Total Chaos</em></h2><p><em>Total Chaos</em> is a standalone survival-horror game based on a <em>Doom II</em> total conversion mod created by the same guy behind <em>Turbo Overkill</em>. With that kind of dry description, it is easy to dismiss this late-in-the-year release.</p><p>But I cannot keep <em>Total Chaos</em> out of my mind. My journey through the island of Fort Oasis was one packed with memorable monster encounters, supremely timed scares, excellent sound design, haunting musical score, and challenging levels that pushed my survival-horror skills to the limit.</p><p>The narrative it tells, while opaque at times, is one packed with heavy subject matters: substance abuse, terminal illness, depression, and self-harm. Its gameplay loop is a satisfying mix of building makeshift melee weapons, scrambling against deranged monsters, and managing health.</p><p><em>Total Chaos</em> isn't higher on my list because some of its <em>Doom II</em> roots make it an acquired taste. The labyrinthine maps, manual save system, unforgiving resource management, and occasional jank can lead to a hostile player experience. Thankfully, I'm one of those sickos who completely clicked with this nasty surprise of a game.</p><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/no-i-m-not-a-human-window-appearance.jpg?itok=7BpQ5FZB 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1400" height="788">

  </picture><h2>9. <em>No, I'm Not a Human</em></h2><p>The second horror game on my list is from indie studio Trioskaz and from the same publisher as last year's <em>Mouthwashing</em>.</p><p><em>No, I'm Not a Human</em> truly feels like a game that came straight from a nightmare. You are trapped in your home during a calamity. At night, people come to your home seeking aid. There are human-looking Visitors that will kill you if you invite them in. Certain Visitors will break into your home and kill you if you're completely alone. Who do you let in? Who do you trust? It manages all of this in an experience you can easily finish in an afternoon.</p><p>Yet in just under three hours, N<em>o, I'm Not a Human</em> presents an excellent demonstration of social anxiety horror and pitch-dark human misery. For that particular consideration in design, it gets a place on my list.</p><picture>

  </picture><h2>8. <em>Hades II</em></h2><p>Supergiant Games shocked fans this year with the first sequel in their development history. In addition, it is a sequel to one of their most critically acclaimed games.</p><p>The only real problem with <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/hades-2-review-new-standard-for-rougelites" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="ee979716-54c8-4f21-87b7-fe53a52b6c74" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow"><em>Hades II</em></a> is that Melinoe's quest is a far more conventional fantasy narrative compared to the more nuanced family drama of the original.</p><p>But <em>Hades II</em> more than earns a spot on my list thanks to Supergiant packing this sequel with more of just about everything. Even if it isn't as ambitious the second time around, <em>Hades II</em> is still a fantastic accomplishment.</p><picture>

  </picture><h2>7. <em>Dispatch</em></h2><p>AdHoc Studios' superhero workplace drama was one of 2025's greatest surprises.

But when you have well-rounded leads, hilarious interludes, and strong performances by some of the best actors in the business, it's hard to complain.</p><picture>

Better still, developer Neobards Entertainment takes several creative risks in this spin-off that ultimately pay off.</p><p><em>Silent Hill f</em> moves away from the titular haunted town to a Japanese fishing village in the 1960s. The focus returns to a female protagonist for the first time since 2003. There is a strong emphasis on melee combat. Its disturbing Otherworld eschews the rusted liminal industrial aesthetic in favor of ethereal dark expanses, Shinto shrines, and torii gates. The story, courtesy of <em>Higurashi</em> creator Ryukishi07, is a layered, at times contradictory, folk tale of twisted rituals and the troubles of female adolescence.</p><p>These are all major swings in their own right. The fact that the final product is an engaging and terrifying horror experience is a miracle.</p><picture>

His only allies are Alters: parallel versions of himself with different career skills and personalities. This narrative experience blends elements of films like <em>The Martian</em>, <em>Moon</em>, and a bit of <em>Everything, Everywhere, All at Once</em>.</p><p><em>The Alters</em> gets a spot on my list for two remarkable achievements. First, its complex, interlocking strategy, base management, and survival sim gameplay clicked with me (genres I personally find dry at best). Second, the experience is elevated by intelligent sci-fi worldbuilding and a strong central journey for the main character. Any narrative that can make you contemplate Albert Camus while facing serious ethical debates is one worthy of praise.</p><p>For that extra step beyond, 11-Bit Studios deserves all the praise.</p><picture>

  </picture><h2>4. <em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em></h2><p>For better and for worse, Sandfall Interactive's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/clair-obscur-expedition-33-review-french-revolution" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="07f3b1f2-234f-4782-8556-c21c1fb23302" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow"><em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em></a> is a game that has critically dominated discussions this year.</p><p>It is praise well-deserved. <em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em> is a triumph of visual presentation and musical brilliance. The story it tells is an emotionally fraught journey of grief and the limitations of art as a means of coping with loss. The gameplay is a polished blend of other RPG contemporaries. The style and impact of <em>Persona</em>. The hybrid combat of the <em>Mario RPG</em> series. The obtuse yet rewarding progression system of early 2000s' <em>Final Fantasy</em>.</p><p>So why isn't it at the top of my list? Because, despite some measured explanations by Sandfall's CEO regarding their implementation, Sandfall Interactive utilized generative AI assets during development and failed to disclose it. While it is true these assets were ultimately used as placeholders and no longer exist in the game's current version, it is still a damper on an otherwise great title.</p><picture>

  </picture><h2>3. <em>Absolum</em></h2><p><em>Absolum</em> is the kind of game I'm surprised didn't happen sooner: a roguelike beat-em-up in the vein of classic <em>Golden Axe</em> made by the same studio behind <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/streets-of-rage-4-review" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow"><em>Streets of Rage 4</em></a>.</p><p>As someone who has spent countless quarters in such button bashers, the core experience of <em>Absolum</em> is a fantastic blend of punchy hits, satisfying supers, and welcome modern flourishes. Combine this strong core loop with an exemplary spread of levels with branching paths and evolving storylines, and you have an endlessly replayable romp. A fun, addictive retro throwback with all of the right modern touches that earns its place among the year's best.</p><picture>

  </picture><h2>2. <em>Split Fiction</em></h2><p>Hazelight Studio's latest co-op adventure doesn't make the best first impression. To be blunt, <em>Split Fiction's</em> narrative is barely above a boilerplate YA sci-fi story at best; its characters are thinly sketched, and its story beats are rote.</p><p>So why is <em>Split Fiction</em> so high on the list? Two words: Level design. Across its twelve-hour runtime, my co-op partner and I were consistently surprised and blown away by the game's relentlessly creative setpieces, vignettes, and boss fights. The finale alone has quickly risen to one of my favorite gaming moments ever. Take a bow, Hazelight development team and director Josef Fares, for this rollercoaster ride of a game.</p><picture>

  </picture><h2>1. <em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em></h2><p><em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em> was a game in an unenviable position. This long-awaited sequel to <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/hollow-knight" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow"><em>Hollow Knight</em></a> has been in development so long that fans descended into rabid speculation and delusion. It was the kind of self-sustaining hype only bolstered by <em>Hollow Knight's</em> already impressive reputation of being one of the best 2D action games of the past few years.</p><p>It's a narrative too familiar in this industry. Excellent debut title. Sky-high expectations for the follow-up. Inevitable disappointment when it fails to deliver, followed by backlash.</p><p>But something funny happened with <em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em>. It delivered. Hornet's journey to the land of Pharloom is an impressive Metroidvania adventure, one that explores and interrogates corrupt religious institutions and the importance of faith. The game's murderous, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/opinions/death-to-death-runs" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="bc88c70a-a511-49c5-9fc0-4b3f70907424" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">borderline unfair, difficulty curve</a>, and brutal in-game economy reinforce its cogent commentary.</p><p>On top of that, Team Cherry put multiple AAA publishers to shame by delivering this excellent title, not through crunch or by cutting corners, but by taking their time.</p><p>It is thanks to that perfect blend of development and result that secures <em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em> my top spot.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>2025 was a weird year! I don’t think anyone would disagree with that. For me personally, this was my first year post-college graduation, which I imagine is a weird time for everyone, but it feels especially weird in a post-COVID world.</p><p>There were a lot of times the world was confusing. I had to find out how insurance works! Buying a car is really expensive and complicated! But, while there weren’t any games that blew me away this year, I found a lot of comfort in games this year. Here were the ones that helped me most.</p><h2>10. <em>Monster Train 2</em></h2><p><picture>

In short, <em>Monster Train 2 </em>ended up my second favorite deckbuilder of the year, thanks to how many ways it gives you to play.</p><h2>9. <em>Ball X Pit</em></h2><p><picture>

  </picture>The subgenre that <em>Vampire Survivors</em> spawned had some great entries this year, but for me, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/ball-x-pit-review-bubble-bobble-toil-and-trouble" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="bc62caf3-6a98-45be-907e-22ef807517ec" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow"><em>Ball X Pit</em></a> is the one that takes the cake. As you descend into a pit, you upgrade your arsenal of balls, using characters with varied abilities to constantly put new twists on your run. After being a PC-heavy gamer this year, <em>Ball X Pit</em> has been the perfect “chill on the couch after work” game.</p><p>Where I thought it might lose me is the city building. I’ve never been enamored by games like <em>Stardew Valley</em>, and the mechanic in games like <em>Cult of the Lamb</em> has just never interested me. After getting a few hours into <em>Ball X Pit</em>, though, I had a great time developing the village. The loop of repositioning my buildings to try and send my villagers on the perfect harvest became really satisfying and, if nothing else, a very low-time investment way to build a city and get right back into the action.</p><h2>8. <em>Rematch</em></h2><p><em><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/rematch.jpg?itok=7qJJI4YS 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1920" height="1080">

But, what <em>Rematch</em> lacks in a skill ceiling, it makes up for with a high skill floor.</p><p>Once you get the hang of the controls, pulling off cool stuff is pretty easy. Passing across the pitch to a teammate is one thing, sure. But, running down the field, slamming the ball against the wall to your teammate, who bicycle kicks it into the goal? Man, that feels good. Compared to <em>Rocket League</em>, <em>Rematch</em> is more of a battle of wits than a battle of execution, and it’s a ton of fun.</p><h2>7. <em>StarVaders</em></h2><p><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/starvaders-key-art.jpg?itok=59E0TZWo 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1920" height="1080">

  </picture>Remember earlier when I said <em>Monster Train 2</em> was the second-best deckbuilder I’ve played this year? <em>StarVaders</em> is the one taking the number one spot.</p><p>Like <em>Slay the Spire</em> and <em>Space Invaders</em> had a baby bathed exclusively in Saturday morning cartoons, <em>StarVaders</em> is much more puzzle than traditional combat. Instead of being concerned with health, your job is to prevent Doom, generated when enemies reach a certain position on the board.&nbsp;</p><p>When you take damage, junk is temporarily added to your deck instead of losing HP. It’s a small change, but makes calculations so different from other deckbuilders. Should you take a hit to avoid generating Doom, but make your deck worse? It's a fun calculus to run, and while it hasn't eaten as many hours as other deckbuilders I've played, the hours I spent were memorable ones.</p><h2>6. <em>Ninja Gaiden: Ragebound</em></h2><p><picture>

  </picture>At the start of this year, I had never played a <em>Ninja Gaiden</em> game. I’m not a big <em>Souls</em> guy, and I don’t really seek out difficult games. But after seeing rave reviews, I gave <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/ninja-gaiden-ragebound-review-razor-sharp-retro-platformer" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="1f5be4cb-8821-406e-ac38-384d019a3a18" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow"><em>Ragebound</em></a> a chance, and I’m really glad I did!</p><p>In the midst of a busy travel season in the spring and summer, I was playing a ton of this on flights. As I progressively got more frustrated, it made those eventual defeats all the more sweeter. I think I finally understand Soulslike gamers. I still won’t be one of them though!</p><h2>5. <em>PEAK</em></h2><p><picture>

  </picture>In one run, I saw a bbno$ concert, got eaten by my friend, and shot myself out of a cannon across a lava pit. There’s nothing quite like <em>PEAK</em>.</p><h2>4. <em>Rift of the NecroDancer</em></h2><p><picture>

  </picture>I miss <em>Guitar Hero</em>, man. For a while, I thought there might not be anything that scratches a rhythm game itch like it ever again. Then, I played <em>Rift of the NecroDancer</em>.</p><p>Like <em>Guitar Hero</em>, notes come at you on a track, and you’ll need good reflexes and rhythm. Unlike <em>Guitar Hero</em>, these notes come in the forms of little guys, each of which will need different types of rhythm to defeat. Sure, skeletons and slimes just need to be hit on the beat once. But what about armadillos? They need to be hit in quick succession a la eighth notes in music. Enemies of different species and colors all have their own quirks that you need to be ready for.</p><p>And at first, it’s tough. It can be difficult to remember all of the traits that each creature has. But you get out of <em>Rift</em> what you put in. The more time you spend chasing high scores, the more fun you’ll have, and the more everything will start to connect. Not to mention, with DLC tracks from other games like <em>Shovel Knight</em> and <em>Everhood</em>, and even a pack of songs by Hatsune Miku, there’s always something new to play. <em>Rift of the NecroDancer</em> is one of my favorite rhythm games, and it just keeps getting better.</p><h2>3. <em>Hades II</em></h2><p><picture>

  </picture>Depending on the day, <em>Hades</em> is one of my all-time favorite games. The way it intertwines roguelike trappings with fantastic storytelling is still unmatched, including by its sequel.</p><p>In the moment-to-moment gameplay, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/hades-2-review-new-standard-for-rougelites" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="ee979716-54c8-4f21-87b7-fe53a52b6c74" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow"><em>Hades II</em></a> blows its predecessor out of the water. The cast is far more effective than it is in <em>Hades</em>, and the new Boons and weapons are all fantastic. Runs to both the surface and underworld are varied, and runs all feel really distinct.</p><p>Where <em>Hades II</em> unfortunately lost me is the writing. The stories and characters I loved so much in the first game felt lacking in the sequel. When I want to go back for a story, I’ll probably go back to the original <em>Hades</em>. But, when I want to go back for one run, I’ll go back to <em>Hades II</em>.</p><h2>2. <em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em></h2><p><picture>

  </picture>After spending a much higher than I hoped amount on a Nintendo Switch 2, there weren’t a ton of games that were on my radar right away. Playing <em>Cyberpunk</em> on it has been great, sure, and <em>Mario Kart World</em> provided a few great nights of multiplayer fun, but nothing was a strict system seller for me. But, after picking up <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/donkey-kong-bananza-review-oohh-banana" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="1274fb40-6e8d-4703-bb0e-20669236af7b" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow"><em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em></a>, I really am glad I waited outside Best Buy for that Switch 2.</p><p>Another Nintendo game, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/legend-of-zelda-tears-of-kingdom-review" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="90af5ca2-2e3e-472f-baf1-9df7fb10d3cc" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow"><em>The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</em></a> is one of my favorite games of all time. The big thing it has in common with <em>Bananza</em>? Neither game should work, but they do. Both are massive technical achievements, and <em>Bananza</em>’s destructible environments are densely packed with things to do.&nbsp;</p><p>Most anywhere you dig will lead to something cool. And if it doesn’t? Who cares, dude? You just punched through a planet! That’s awesome! There’s some cracks that show in <em>Bananza</em> that aren’t in <em>Tears of the Kingdom</em>; in particular, I recall some frame rate dips in the middle of some tough boss battles. But moment-to-moment, <em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em> is just pure fun. What more can you ask for?</p><h2>1. <em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em></h2><p><picture>

I’ve been wrestling with my feelings on the game for a while after feeling pretty conflicted, especially after the game was shown to have placeholder assets created by generative AI. But when I think about my experience playing <em>Expedition 33</em>, I think of two things that I feel are both head and shoulders above other games and undeniably human.</p><p>First is the music. I’ve been a big fan of video game music, and this soundtrack is an incredible achievement. The way Lorien Testard leaps between styles effortlessly is really something to behold, and Alice Duport-Percier’s vocals elevate the music to become something really special. I still listen to it quite often while I'm at work.</p><p>Second is the performances. Sure, the glitzy castings of Charlie Cox and Andy Serkis made a big splash, and they both give excellent performances. The real standouts, though, are Jennifer English and Ben Starr as Maelle and Verso. The final hours in particular feature some really great moments for both actors, and the facial animation is top-notch. I felt truly affected by the performances in <em>Expedition 33</em>, and I’m sure I’ll still be thinking about these performances and listening to this soundtrack for quite some time in 2026.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>2025 is the year that broke me when it comes to video games. The years of a constant barrage of new AAA releases, almost all of which need to be 50+ hours, has worn me down, especially when juxtaposed with rampant layoffs, studio closures, and the general state of capitalism in the industry.</p><p>I've found some solace in the indie and AA space, however you want to define those terms. And there were still some interesting AAA games out there this year. <em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em> is a great adventure that's as fun as it is playful, and <em>Doom: The Dark Ages</em> turns the Doom Slayer into Captain America if he were bathed in hellfire.</p><p>In the not-so-AAA space, I loved playing <em>Peak </em>for a couple weekends. It's a fantastic way to kill time with friends. <em>Ball x Pit</em> is a genius mix of <em>Arkanoid</em>, city building, and roguelike elements that offers perfect bite-sized gaming sessions. And I found a new way to zone out with <em>PowerWash Simulator 2</em>, which adds just enough upgrades over the previous to make it easier but not too braindead.</p><p>But let's draw the arbitrary line in the sand here and start diving into my top 7 games of 2025, in some vibes-based order.</p><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/top-games-2026-split-fiction.jpg?itok=OjGyXmXC 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1920" height="1080">

  </picture><h2><em>Split Fiction</em></h2><p>I played <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/split-fiction-review-everything-everywhere" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="97535e5a-e23e-4679-b20b-f4071ecead93" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow"><em>Split Fiction</em></a> with my partner in the first half of 2025, and granted, partway through the game, we got a little bored. Every new set of powers and upgrades was novel and interesting, but the length of time with each mechanic dragged on just a tiny bit in some sections. It was like, "Okay, we get it."</p><p>But the final race to the finish line really stuck with us. It felt fresh, innovative, and chaotic, playing with the literal split fiction that the entire game sets up. Rushing between worlds and seeing things blend together felt like a fever dream.</p><p>Much like <em>Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons</em> or <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/way-out-review-cooperative-camp" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="0a8b056d-dfa1-4eb5-bf43-657d581fa8c1" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow"><em>A Way Out</em></a> before it, Josef Fares' team has one big, unique, genuinely cool idea at the end of <em>Split Fiction </em>that makes it<em> </em>worth the journey.</p><picture>

  </picture><h2><em>Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii</em></h2><p>Can I defend <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/like-dragon-pirate-yakuza-in-hawaii-review-yarr-kuza" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="94818ce8-72d8-409e-b568-4f7ba9a213ad" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow"><em>Like a Dragon: Pirate Yakuza in Hawaii</em></a> in a scholarly GOTY debate with fellow peers? Probably not. At this point, you're either super into <em>Like a Dragon</em> games, want to get into them, or absolutely don't get them. I fall in the first camp, and even though <em>Pirate Yakuza</em> isn't as good as some of the other recent games in the series, it's still a tonally unique and wild ride.</p><p>The protagonist, Goro Majima, gets amnesia, ends up on the shores of Hawaii, and becomes a pirate on a whim. His journey is kicked off by a campy musical number, and he plays a wonderful role model for a young boy, despite being rough around the edges.</p><p>With silly mini games, pirate ship death matches, and the ability to summon spectral monkeys, <em>Pirate Yakuza</em>—and the franchise at large—injects some levity into its unserious machismo. There really isn't anything like these games, and I'll always go out of my way to play the newest releases.</p><picture>

  </picture><h2><em>Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</em></h2><p>Honestly, Kojima won me over with this one. I was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/death-stranding-review" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="ae097f31-89e8-48fb-a0e2-73ea8500c938" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow"><em>Death Stranding's</em></a> biggest hater back in the day—I even argued against it being <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/features/every-game-techraptor-scored-10-10" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="98bd7345-b819-4204-99ab-eec184133f3b" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">one of our few 10/10 games</a>—but something about this sequel just hits perfectly. It streamlines some of the more tedious parts of the first game, and you get to the fun parts sooner.</p><p>It doesn't take long for you to build up a suite of tools and vehicles to optimize your routes. Doing side quests gets easier as the game goes on, and even the tedium of building roads and rails becomes easy, if not just a tiny bit tedious still. Even better, there's all sorts of silly and new ways to play the game. You can hurt people with pizza fu, ride a hoverboard, and jump off ramps with no consequence.</p><p>I think with <em>Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</em>, I found a zen state that the gameplay was going for. Combat sequences are more straightforward too, making it easier to mode shift between delivery man and demolition man.</p><p>Of course, the story is still absolutely ridiculous. It's a world where the rule of cool is arguably more important than the substance, where it's more vibes-based than anything else. The game's most memorable moments come from when the game doesn't take itself that seriously, even when the dramatic tension soars.</p><picture>

It takes everything I loved about the classic Telltale formula but streamlines it for the better. Episodes are tight and full of twists, making it an extremely lean package that trims out all the fat.</p><p>It pulls you into the narrative and gives you a front row seat to steer the story. Your choices truly feel like they matter, even when they ultimately don't. It's that belief and immersion that makes <em>Dispatch</em> work so well, especially for the big choices that change the overarching journey (like the one at the end of episode 3).</p><p>While the main characters are fine enough, the best people in <em>Dispatch</em> are the smaller side characters who all bring different levels of comedy relief. The scene of Phenomeman slowing highway traffic on the news while Waterboy disgustingly cleans the TV perfectly encapsulates the energy of <em>Dispatch</em>'s best moments. It concisely and effectively shows who both of these characters are right when you need to make a choice relevant to them. Plus, it's hilarious.</p><picture>

I played it with my partner this year, and it was so much fun figuring out its myriad secrets together. I distinctly remember the moment we had to pull out a notepad and pen together, realizing how deep the waters beneath us were.</p><p>Granted, the roguelike gameplay ultimately undermines and weakens the puzzle gameplay, weakening the overall package. Before the magic wore off though, <em>Blue Prince</em> was easily one of the most enthralling experiences I've had in 2025. Even when I wasn't playing it, I was thinking about all the different possible solutions.</p><p>Everything about this game is clever, even down to its name. I sometimes still mistype the game as "blue prints" because it feels like both names perfectly fit the game.</p><picture>

  </picture><h2><em>Hades II</em></h2><p><em>Hades</em> won our <a href="https://techraptor.net/blog/2020-techraptor-awards-game-of-year" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">Game of the Year Award in 2020</a>, so it's not surprising to see its sequel on my list. <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/hades-2-review-new-standard-for-rougelites" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="ee979716-54c8-4f21-87b7-fe53a52b6c74" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow"><em>Hades II</em></a> really is just a bigger, better, bolder version of its older brother. It has twice as many levels, but it feels like quadruple the amount of content.</p><p>The action takes a slightly different approach considering Melinoe's slight aversion to close-ranged combat, but it's still a riveting, rewarding story full of intense combat, touching stories, and fleshed-out characters.</p><p>Her struggle to kill time is framed through a (somewhat) relatable family conflict, and with the post-release patch, the final parts of the story wrap up nicely. The excuse to continue doing runs in the post-game feels a little far fetched, but it works because the combat is ridiculously satisfying.</p><p>When a build works, it just hits so perfectly. Building around one mechanic, whether it's your cast or your omega special, simply feels so good. <em>Hades II</em> is more than everything I wanted in a sequel. The action, music, and narrative all hit just right.</p><picture>

It was unexpected and continues to surprise all the way through the final act. The hype for it is definitely overplayed and annoying, though the hatred for it is just as equally obnoxious. Regardless of where you fall on the fence, let's remember that other games besides the ones you like can be good to different people as well.</p><p>Unfortunately, yes, the use of generative AI in <em>Clair Obscur</em> isn't ideal—<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/interviews/witchfire-ceo-no-ai-larian" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="b6a9181d-93fd-4739-9598-8dc67ddaf53c" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">AI in general is a complicated topic in the industry.</a> I personally am not a fan of it being used in any game since it's such a creative field, and that includes with this game. But when you take the overall package for what it is, it's compelling and full of heart, tragedy, and twists.</p><p>The rock-solid turn-based gameplay feels so satisfying, especially when you set off a combo of effects. At some point though, it evolves into something that rewards you for breaking it. Sure, this makes the final couple hours stupidly easy, but by then, I was more invested in the story rather than the gameplay.</p><p>The narrative takes some big swings, deconstructing what you thought were the boundaries of this world for the sake of highlighting its characters and emotional struggles. It gets surreal, but in that space, <em>Clair Obscur</em> delivers a memorable story about the many ways people process grief—or put off processing it.</p>

<p>Layoffs in the video game world seemingly wait for no one. According to recent posts on social media, Warner Bros. Games held layoffs in December at its San Francisco location.</p>



<p>The layoffs, which were first reported on by <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/report-warner-bros-games-eliminates-roles-at-san-francisco-studio" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Game Developer</a>, point to a number of LinkedIn posts from, now former, employees at the company. Two such employees impacted by the cuts were the San Francisco studio’s Art Director and Director of Design.</p>







<p><strong>“It’s been a helluva ride but all good things must come to an end,”</strong> former Art Director Roland Herran wrote. <strong>“Just wrapped up my time at WB Games San Francisco last month- unfortunately hit by, you guessed it, layoffs. Super appreciative and proud of everything we accomplished at the studio in the last 11 years.”</strong></p>



<p>Tony Perkins, former director of design, said, <strong>“Loved my time here with the San Francisco team and the project we worked on is awesome and something I am super proud of. </strong></p>



<p><strong>“Unfortunately, the stars didn’t align, and a great game didn’t find the success it needed!”</strong></p>



<p>There’s no word as to what specific game Perkins is referencing in his statement.</p>







<p>Warner Bros. Games San Francisco has been around since 2013. As a studio, it primarily focused on free-to-play and mobile games over the years.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming has reached out to Warner Bros. Games for more context surrounding the layoffs. Should a response be received, it will be added to this article. </p>



<p>Currently, Warner Bros. Games is part of a potential sale of that side of the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/netflix-set-to-buy-warner-bros-in-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">business over to Netflix</a>. Rival company Paramount has continued to make efforts in a “hostile takeover” bid, but it <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/warner-bros-expected-to-reject-paramounts-latest-offer-sticking-with-netflix/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">has been rejected</a> multiple times. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Following some controversy, the developers at <em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em> creator Larian Studios have further clarified their use of generative AI. CEO Swen Vincke and other Larian developers held an AMA on Reddit where they answered users’ questions about the team’s next title, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxzyVeAG00w"><em>Divinity</em></a>. They also fielded questions related to reports that the studio was <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/845713/larian-ceo-divinity-ai-swen-vincke">using generative AI in its development process</a>.</p><p>“So first off - there is not going to be any GenAI art in Divinity,” <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1q870w5/comment/nyl9tdz/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">Vincke wrote</a> in response to a question on Reddit. Last month, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-12-16/-baldur-s-gate-3-maker-promises-divinity-will-be-next-level?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc2NTg5MzY2NSwiZXhwIjoxNzY2NDk4NDY1LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJUN0Q4ODFLSVAzSTkwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.D26Cs7X_5kH5HuJT2frcX_AMIXyuXWefzz5NK2VlXEI">in an interview with <em>Bloomberg</em></a>, Vincke stated that while they weren’t using AI-generated assets in <em>Divinity</em>, the team was experimenting with AI tools “to explore ideas, flesh out PowerPoint presentations, develop concept art and write placeholder text.”</p><p>His comments were immediately and fiercely criticized online by gamers, developers, and former Larian employees. In response, Vincke <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/larian-ceo-responds-to-divinity-gen-ai-backlash-we-are-neither-releasing-a-game-with-any-ai-components-nor-are-we-looking-at-trimming-down-teams-to-replace-them-with-ai">issued a statement</a> clarifying that they were not using the tool to generate concept art, but as something artists could use to iterate on ideas faster.</p><p>Now, in the Reddit AMA, he says they won’t use it for concept art at all. “We’ve decided to refrain from using genAI tools during concept art development,” he wrote. “That way there can be no discussion about the origin of the art.” But Vincke did leave room for the possible use of gen AI assets in the future.</p><p>“If we use a GenAI model to create in-game assets, then it’ll be trained on data we own,” he wrote.</p><p>In addition to art, Larian also clarified gen AI usage with text. “We don’t have any text generation touching our dialogues, journal entries or other writing in Divinity,” <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1q870w5/comment/nylh1fm/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">wrote writing director Adam Smith</a>. He said text generation was only for research, not development purposes, and that the results were too low-quality when compared to a human writer and Larian’s own standards.</p><p>“We had a limited group experimenting with tools to generate text, but the results hit a 3/10 at best,” Smith wrote. “Even my worst first drafts ... are at least a 4/10 ... and the amount of iteration required to get even individual lines to the quality we want is enormous.”</p><p>While these comments might reassure players that at least gen AI assets won’t be in the final product, Vincke reaffirmed that gen AI would still play some role at Larian.</p><p>“Our hope is that it can aid us to refine ideas faster, leading to a more focused development cycle, less waste, and ultimately, a higher-quality game.”</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTAy"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Ash Parrish</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games/859551/baldurs-gate-3-larian-studios-gen-ai-concept-art-reddit-ama]]></content:encoded>

            <title><![CDATA[Would You Pay Over $1,000 For A Steam Machine?]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/steam-machine-price-leak-division-3-fable-ps5-2000658489</link>
            <guid>1401889</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Valve is supposed to reveal pre-order options for the <a href="https://kotaku.com/steam-machine-valve-console-price-ps5-pro-2000643554">Steam Machine</a> in early 2026 but PC gaming prices are getting out of control. Ubisoft is already hyping up <em>The Division 3</em>. And a mystery game is set to appear at the first Xbox showcase of 2026. <em>Pentiment 2</em>? It’s another edition of Morning Checkpoint, <em>Kotaku</em>‘s daily roundup of gaming news and culture.</p> <p>While it’s been the case for years now that physical games come with almost nothing inside the case but the disc, I still feel a brutal pang of disappointment <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1q7a7rg/the_excitement_of_opening_up_a_video_game_sure/">every time I encounter it</a>. I recently bought a handful of discounted games <a href="https://kotaku.com/rpg-sale-cheap-ff12-kingdom-come-2-ps5-switch-2000653958">over the holidays</a> and while their presence on my shelves pleases me, I can’t totally shake the disturbing void hiding within. It makes the rare game that does come packed full of inserts <a href="https://kotaku.com/the-binding-of-isaac-on-nintendo-switch-has-a-gorgeous-1793423566">all the more special</a>.</p>

 <h2>A Czech retailer has placeholder pricing for the Steam Machine starting at $950</h2> <p><a href="https://clawsomegamer.com/retailer-leak-puts-steam-machine-price-at-over-1000/">Clawsomegamer discovered</a> the detail in the source code for the web listing at Smarty.cz. That’s not an official retail partner for the device, making it extra unlikely that this is actually reflective of Valve’s pricing strategy rather than retailers just inserting placeholder guesstimates (Smarty.cz has $1,070 for the 2TB version). Still, it does have people worried about what kind of sticker shock they might eventually see as recent RAM shortages propel PC gaming component prices <a href="https://kotaku.com/asus-rog-ally-price-increase-nvidia-amd-ai-ps6-delay-2000656448">through the roof</a> at the start of 2026.</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Big grain of salt:</p> <p>A Czech retailer (<a href="https://t.co/XIPdLHBOif">https://t.co/XIPdLHBOif</a>) has already put up a preliminary listing for the upcoming Valve Steam Machine (512GB) 👀</p> <p>The product page doesn't display a public price yet, but checking the site's source code via browser developer tools reveals a… <a href="https://t.co/QRqJxbnT6x">pic.twitter.com/QRqJxbnT6x</a></p> <p>— Clawsomegamer (@Clawsomegamer) <a href="https://twitter.com/Clawsomegamer/status/2009619612280017118?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 9, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p>Valve previously promised to reveal more information about its new living room console early this year, but those plans could be pushed back if the current supply chain issues are making it harder to get the first wave of devices manufactured at an affordable price point. While Valve has hinted that Steam Machines would be priced more like a gaming PC than a $500 console, no one knows if that means closer to $700 or closer to $1,000. The company <a href="https://kotaku.com/steam-machine-price-console-linus-skillup-valve-2000646965">did hint that it’s not going to be</a> using profits from Steam to subsidize the price.</p>

 <h2>An Xbox showcase later this month hides a mystery game reveal</h2> <p>A fourth game at the Dev Direct taking place on January 22 was first teased <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/xbox-game-studios-bethesda-abk-ot36-oops-all-obsidian.1310962/page-215#post-149812867">by Shinobi602</a>.&nbsp;VGC corroborated the hint and <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/the-xbox-developer-direct-will-feature-a-secret-unannounced-fourth-game/">reports</a> that the mystery release is “a smaller-scale original game from one of Xbox Game Studios’ first-party developers.” That suggests it could be a side project in the mold of Obsidian Entertainment’s <em>Pentiment</em>.</p>

 <h2><em>Fable</em> will come to PS5, too</h2> <p>But there’s more! Alongside<em> Forza Horizon 6</em> and Game Freak’s <em>Beast of Reincarnation</em>, both already confirmed for PS5, <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/the-xbox-developer-direct-will-feature-a-secret-unannounced-fourth-game/"><em>VGC</em> also reports</a> that <em>Fable</em> is in development for the Sony platform as well. Xbox exclusivity is dead, yes, but the question remains whether Microsoft will push to start getting these multiplatform releases out day-and-date or still stagger them where it sees fit.</p>

 <h2><em>Helldivers 2</em> kicks off its deadliest year yet</h2> <p>Strange new Illuminate structures <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1q7mfl4/new_squid_structures_23_seconds_into_star_of/?utm_source=embedv2&amp;utm_medium=post_embed&amp;utm_content=post_title&amp;embed_host_url=https://www.gamesradar.com/games/third-person-shooter/after-helldivers-2-boss-teased-death-and-destruction-in-upcoming-update-new-illuminate-structures-ominously-appear-in-a-blink-and-youll-miss-it-moment-in-super-earth-media/">are popping up</a> in the extraction shooter after Arrowhead Game Studios promised players that 2026 would be even bloodier for the forces of space fascism. “A lot of Helldivers will die,” CEO Shams Jorjani recently teased on the game’s Discord when talking about the studio’s upcoming plans. Arrowhead will have its work cut out for it after fans spent the early part of last summer <a href="https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-eos-prosperity-china-steam-reviews-1851782983">beating back an invasion of Super Earth</a>.</p>

 <h2><strong><em>Where Winds Meet</em> starts 2026 off strong</strong></h2> <p>The surprise open-world hit on console and PC has <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfrGu8nZ3i8">dropped its 1.2 update</a> that adds a new boss fight, Guild Battles, and other activities ahead of additional chapters coming later this month and next.</p> <h2><em>The Division 3</em> is shaping up to be a “monster”</h2> <p>That’s according to executive producer Julian Gerighty. “It’s shaping up to be a monster,” he told fans in a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SCiMJQkjV2M">new Ubisoft vidoc</a>. “I can’t really say anything more than that. But within these walls [at] Massive, we are working extremely hard on something that I think will [have] as big an impact as <em>The Division 1</em> was.” There’s no release date in sight for the sequel and Massive is still producing new content for <em>The Division 2</em>. Finding a way to combine the innovation and novelty of the first game with the gameplay polish and scope of the second could be a recipe for something special. Also something that takes a long time to make.</p> <h2>Warner Bros.

              <p><span>The companions who join you on </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/baldurs-gate-3-bg3-review-dungeons-dragons-rpg-larian-1850726491"><i><span>Baldur’s Gate 3</span></i></a><span>’s </span><i><span>epic journey along the Sword Coast</span></i><span> are a </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/the-best-video-game-characters-of-2023-1851085884"><span>wonderful bunch</span></a><span>, but one character definitely got the short end of the stick: Wyll. The Warlock was </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/baldurs-gate-3-character-creator-bear-romance-wyll-1850616671"><span>famously rewritten</span></a><span> ahead of the game’s launch in 2023 when developer Larian decided his story in the early access release wasn’t quite working. Some things stayed the same, such as his character design, Warlock status, and where the player would ultimately recruit him, but his story was completely revamped, his voice actor was changed, and he was given ties to other characters, such as Tiefling party member Karlach.</span></p> <p><span>In </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1q870w5/comment/nylf1wn/?utm_source=embedv2&amp;utm_medium=comment_embed&amp;utm_content=whitespace&amp;embed_host_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.thegamer.com%2Fbaldurs-gate-3-lack-of-wyll-content-larian-response%2F"><span>an ongoing Reddit AMA</span></a><span>, the team at Larian provided some insight into the process and also explained why Wyll has notably less content than other party members as a result. It turns out Wyll’s story was finally coming together right when most other members of the player’s traveling party were being solidified, and some storylines the team planned on implementing him into ended up being cut. Senior writer Kevin VanOrd also explains that he had health issues during some of those iteration phases, which meant that he lost precious time that was meant to be spent fleshing out Wyll’s role. Overall, it sounds like VanOrd loves the character but wishes he could have done more with him.</span></p>

 <blockquote><p><span>As you probably know, we weren’t connecting with Wyll’s Early Access recruitment and initial questing, so we started over at a point when most of the other companion stories were fairly solid. A lot of decisions came later in development than was ideal – and there was a key situation near Baldur’s Gate that I intended to heavily involve Wyll in (the Red War College) that got cut. That meant back to the drawing board again. We eventually tied him to Duke Ravengard and started to work on that element of his arc just in time for me to get unexpectedly ill. I was out of the office for quite a while, and again after the epilogue’s release.</span></p> <p><span>I think that Ansur’s lair was Swen’s idea – we did have the resources for a standalone dungeon, so we got to work on tying Wyll to the Wyrmway, but I couldn’t get more than a dungeon boss out of it. Once the situations were in place, that was that – I had to start writing them.</span></p> <p><span>Wyll’s content is sparser than I’d have liked as a result. He’s also split into two stories, really – the Mizora story and the Ravengard story, and that might have been a mistake in hindsight. I also wish I could [have] given him a stronger endpoint – it always bugged me that he can end up just as he started, as the Blade of Frontiers, without any meaningful difference. All that said, I love the Blade and I am really proud of him, his sincerity, his good nature, and his eager heroism. I’m truly sorry I didn’t give you more quality time with him.</span></p></blockquote> <p><span>In the years since </span><i><span>Baldur’s Gate 3</span></i><span>, Larian has patched in some new content for Wyll and other companions, but he has always felt like he was a few steps behind the rest of the crew. But based on VanOrd’s explanation, it sounds like the character was mostly a victim of circumstance, though that may not satisfy his diehards who have watched other characters get more scenes, interactions, and love over the course of the game.</span></p>

    <div>
        
<p>Intel integrated graphics seem to be getting a significant upgrade with the next generation. One known leaker has gone online to give insight into just how big of a boost they’ll be getting.</p>



<p>In a post on social media, known hardware leaker <a href="https://x.com/OneRaichu/status/2008504896476348601" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">OneRaichu</a> spoke about the in-development Intel Nova Lake CPUs and what it entails from the integrated graphics perspective.</p>







<p>They say that the new architecture, Xe3P, which is expected to launch with the new CPU lineup in 2027, will see a performance uptick of “20-25%” with “even more [performance] uplift for the Xe3P-12C.”</p>



<p>Currently, Intel is preparing to launch its Panther Lake Core Ultra 300 series processors. Those will feature the Xe3 architecture that is also expected to be the main architecture behind the Intel Celestial graphics card line up. Those aren’t expected to be seen, however, until late 2026. </p>







<p>As with all rumors and leaks, until it’s made official or confirmed by Insider Gaming, take the information with a grain of salt. Even from leakers that have been reliable in the past.</p>



<p>What do you think about the rumored performance jump for Intel’s integrated graphics? Does it really matter to you?

Towerborne comes from Stoic, the studio behind The Banner Saga series.</p><p>The news was announced during yesterday's New Game+ Showcase. Towerborne first entered Steam Early Access in September 2024 and Xbox Game Preview in April 2025. It is a co-op fantasy action RPG in the vein of a classic beat ‘em up. Players control an immortal warrior named Ace who must defend the land against a deadly corruption while solving the mystery of a crumbling city. The side-scrolling combat emphasizes combo-heavy melee action, and Ace can be customized with gear that alters your playstyle.</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/V304dd9HZj0"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/V304dd9HZj0" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>When Towerborne first launched in Early Access, it was billed as a free-to-play, always-online title. Stoic has since reworked the game into a traditional paid experience that can be played offline, though it supports online co-op. Additionally, paid cosmetics have been removed; players now unlock cosmetics for free by playing, and new items will be added in the 1.0 version.</p><p>The 1.0 update also features a completed main story, two new bosses, new gear/player abilities, a reworked difficulty system including a new Brutal difficulty setting, and an updated world map. The final version of Towerborne also boasts new music from famed composer Austin Wintory</p><p>Towerborne launches in full on February 26, and it will debut on PlayStation 5 alongside Xbox Series X/S and PC. The Standard Edition is $24.99. The Deluxe Edition, which includes two cosmetic sets, crafting materials, and more, is $29.99.&nbsp;</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/2026/01/09/towerborne-the-action-rpg-by-the-makers-of-the-banner-saga-launches-out-of-early-access]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-a-critical-success-with-critical-failures">Baldur's Gate 3</a> developer Larian "will certainly consider" getting its upcoming release Divinity onto <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Switch 2</a>.</p>
<p>This small nugget of hope for Nintendo users comes from today's AMA with Larian, which the developer hosted over on Reddit. Here, the studio was asked about releasing Divinity - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/larian-announces-new-game-takes-ownership-of-desert-statue">which it announced at The Game Awards last month</a> - on Switch 2.</p>

<p>To this, the studio's technical director <a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Bert_Larian/">u/Bert_Larian</a> noted Larian had just recently released <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/days-after-larians-big-the-game-awards-announcement-2017s-divinity-original-sin-2-receives-current-gen-upgrade-for-switch-2-ps5-and-xbox-series-xs">Divinity Original Sin 2 on Nintendo's latest console</a>, saying: "We love the platform." The developer then assured the community that Larian would of course also keep the Switch 2 in mind for Divinity.</p>
<p>During this same AMA, the developer was also asked about Divinity being playable on Steam Deck, because who doesn't enjoy that welcome portability. Again, Bert was very enthusiastic about the platform, and just like the studio loves Switch 2, it also loves Steam Deck.</p>
<p>"Since [Baldur's Gate 3] was one of the most played games on the platform, we will do our best to again release on the platform," Bert said.</p>

<p>Following Divinity's announcement last month, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/larian-is-using-generative-ai-confirms-ceo-but-divinity-wont-contain-anything-ai-generated">Larian's CEO stated the studio was using generative AI to explore ideas, expand on internal presentations, develop concept art, and write placeholder text</a>. It then faced its fair share of backlash following this comment, and Swen Vincke responded, stating: "<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/holy-fck-guys-were-not-pushing-hard-for-or-replacing-concept-artists-with-ai-larian-ceo-responds-to-genai-backlash">Holy **** guys we're not 'pushing hard' for or replacing concept artists with AI</a>."</p>
<p>He then announced the AMA, and today the studio head said <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/change-of-mind-larian-says-it-will-not-use-gen-ai-at-all-in-relation-to-divinity-concept-art">Larian had changed its stance on generative AI following the backlash</a>.</p>

            <guid>1401847</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p><strong>Hooded Horse</strong>, a publisher that made a name for itself when it picked up <a href="https://wccftech.com/manor-lords-indie-hit-160k-concurrent-steam/">Manor Lords</a> and has since been known to have a keen eye for strategy and city-building games, has drawn its line in the sand on GenAI tech. In an interview with <a href="https://kotaku.com/hooded-horse-gen-ai-art-ban-4x-strategy-steam-2000658179">Kotaku,</a> Hooded Horse's chief executive officer, <strong>Tim Bender</strong>, made it clear that the publisher will not sign studios that use GenAI.</p>



<p>The studio has even gone so far as to add a <strong>"<em>no f***ing AI assets"</em></strong> line into its contracts, banning any studios that work with it from using generative AI technology in the process of developing their game. "<em>If I sound frustrated, it's because, like, honestly, all this thing has done is made our lives more difficult</em>," said Bender.</p>



<p>"<em>I f***ing hate GenAI art, and it has made my life more difficult in many ways,</em>" Bender continued. "<em>Suddenly it infests s**t in a way it shouldn't. It is not written into our contracts if we're publishing the game, 'no f***ing AI assets.'"</em></p>



<p>It's a strong stance for the publisher to take, though not a surprising one when you consider the amount of <a href="https://wccftech.com/larian-studios-will-refrain-from-using-genai-tools-to-develop-concept-art-will-use-it-elsewhere/">backlash studios like Larian</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/amidst-arc-raiders-success-embarks-use-of-gen-ai-voices-bubbles-over-even-epics-ceo-joins-the-fray/">Embark Studios</a> have received with their admittance of using GenAI tech, and even non-gaming companies like <a href="https://wccftech.com/dell-pulls-back-ai-first-push-after-admitting-customers-arent-interested/">Dell admitting that consumers are "<em>not buying based on AI</em>,"</a> signifying that people do not want to hear that AI and GenAI is at the forefront of new products.</p>



<p>That said, Bender goes on to say that simply including the ban on GenAI in the contract and drawing its line in the sand is what's easy. Actually ensuring that developers follow through with the ban is a different story. </p>



<p>"<em>We've gotten to the point where we also talk to developers and we recommend they don't use any GenAI anywhere in the process because some of them might otherwise think, 'Okay, well, maybe what I'll do is for this place, I'll put it as a placeholder,' right? Like some, people will have this thought, like they would never want to let it in the game, but they'll think, 'It can be a placeholder in this prototype build.' But if that gets done, of course, there's a chance that that slips through, because it only takes one of those slipping through in some build and not getting replaced or something</em>. <em>Because of that, we're constantly having to watch and deal with it and try to prevent it from slipping in, because it's cancerous</em>.<em>"</em></p>



<p>It's clear that GenAI is going to continue to be a controversial topic in the video game industry when it comes to its use in game development. Some studios, like the aforementioned Embark, will continue to use it without shame or fear, especially when you consider that Embark's latest release,<strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/roundup/arc-raiders-everything-we-know-about-the-latest-hot-extraction-shooter/"> ARC Raiders</a></strong>, is arguably <a href="https://wccftech.com/arc-raiders-helped-push-steam-to-have-highest-grossing-december-yet/">one of the biggest recent commercial successes in games</a>.</p>



<p>But for Hooded Horse, it's not so much a question of using GenAI being bad PR; it's that the team firmly does not believe in the technology and takes an ethical stance against it. "<em>When it comes to GenAI, it's not a PR issue, it's an ethics issue,</em>" Bender added. "<em>The reality is, there's so much of it going on that the commitment just has to be that you won't allow it in the game, and if it's ever discovered, because this artist that was hired by this outside person slipped something in, you get it out, and you replace it. That has to be the commitment. It's a shame that it's even necessary, and it's a very frustrating thing to have to worry about</em>."</p>



<p>Ultimately, Hooded Horse is just one indie publisher in a sea of publishers. We can't say if another company will take the same approach, but as conversation and controversy around GenAI continue to rise, it wouldn't be a surprise if we start seeing more companies draw their own line in the sand on GenAI.</p>

            <p>With <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/baldurs-gate-iii">Baldur's Gate 3</a> and its gang of rowdy adventuring mates in the rear view mirror, Larian are hoping to improve a couple of aspects of how they handle companions going forwards - a process that'll likely kick off in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/divinity-larian">Divinity</a>. In particular, the development of deeper relationships between party members and a more subtle build to the moment when the player's relationship veers into <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/baldurs-gate-3-is-a-relentlessly-horny-video-game">deeply horny territory</a> are on their list of learnings.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>That's the answer senior writer Kevin VanOrd game when asked what narrative improvements he's keen to pull off in today's Larian AMA, which also saw the studio <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/larian-will-no-longer-use-genai-for-divinity-concept-art-and-any-genai-used-for-other-games-will-be-trained-on-data-we-own">provide an update</a> on how they plan to handle using generative AI.</p>
<p>"Firstly, to have more interaction between companions - not just with more and better banter, but to have them develop deeper relationships with each other, just as they do with players," he wrote. "Secondly, to ramp up player friendship and romance more subtly, so relationship building feels natural."</p>
<p>It's nice to see the studio not simply hand-waving the first part away, especially given all the praise Baldur's Gate 3 rightly got for the regular little chats its companions have at various points throughout your roaming with them. While that banter's great, it can still sometimes feel like the distances between each of your buddies' tents in camp aren't bridged all to often, unless <a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/G8-dxmsnVsQ">Minthara fancies having some fun with Gale</a> while the two are out and about.</p>
<blockquote data-embed-height="280"><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1q870w5/comment/nyljdr7/">Comment</a><br> by<a href="https://www.reddit.com/user/Wombat_Medic/">u/Wombat_Medic</a> from discussion<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1q870w5/larian_studios_divinity_ama/"></a><br> in<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/">Games</a></blockquote><p><span data-type="targeting">
<span>To see this content please enable targeting cookies.</span>
</span></p><p>Then there's the sometimes rapid progression of the player's relationships to seriously sexy states perhaps a tad too quickly. It's not something I recall being too bothered by, possibly because I was keen to spend hours giggling at bear sex after seeing clips of that cutscene or because I'm a bloke and therefore the concept of such things lasting more than two minutes is beyond me. There's also the matter of BG3 sex speedruns taking off as their own form of bonkers entertainment, something that might not have happened if you had no choice but to still be courting deep into the final act.</p><p>On the other hand, having such bonds feel as genuine and human as possible is something I can't knock people for desiring, and Larian for striving to deliver. Who knows, maybe the luxuriously-rendered lovemaking BG3 boasted will become even more beloved if you've got to work a bit harder to reach such points of climax.</p>
<p>There we go. I've lowered the tone last thing on a Friday. Merry weekend.</p>

                <p>The publisher behind strategy games Endless Legend 2, Terra Invicta, and Against the Storm has officially banned the use of AI-generated assets in all its products. Hooded Horse has had a significant presence in the strategy game space over the last few years, thanks to hits like Manor Lords. Now, when many publishers and developers are evaluating (or touting) their relationship to generative AI, Hooded Horse is rebuking its use for art generation.</p><p dir="ltr">Hooded Horse CEO Tim Bender discussed the ban in an interview with <a dir="ltr" href="https://kotaku.com/hooded-horse-gen-ai-art-ban-4x-strategy-steam-2000658179" rel="noreferrer nofollow ">Kotaku</a>, emphasizing that restrictions on AI art are part of every contract Hooded Horse signs. He said, "It is now written into our contracts if we’re publishing the game, 'no f**king AI assets.'" He also expressed personal exasperation with how GenAI has made his job harder. He said, "If I sound frustrated, it’s because, like, honestly, all this thing has done is made our lives more difficult."</p><p dir="ltr">This frustration comes from the fact that GenAI usage can be difficult to catch. Even if the intention is to use a generated asset only as a placeholder, those assets can easily make their way to the final product. "We’ve gotten to the point where we also talk to developers and we recommend they don’t use any gen AI anywhere in the process," Bender elaborated.</p><p dir="ltr">Still, preventing these slip-ups requires constant vigilance. As Bender put it, "We’re constantly having to watch and deal with it and try to prevent it from slipping in, because it’s cancerous." Bender's concerns have precedent. <a dir="ltr" href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/clair-obscur-expedition-33-just-lost-its-indie-game-of-the-year-awards-over-ai-concerns/1100-6537129/">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 lost its Indie Game of the Year award</a> over "placeholder" AI assets, which were removed after players spotted them.</p><p dir="ltr">Generative AI has become a ubiquitous and controversial feature of game development and tech culture in general. Developers and fans alike criticized <a dir="ltr" href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/larian-ceo-says-a-lot-has-been-lost-in-translation-amid-divinitys-ai-blowback/1100-6537085/">Baldur's Gate 3 developer Larian's usage of generative AI</a>, prompting clarification from Larian CEO Swen Vincke. <a dir="ltr" href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/arc-raiders-dev-defends-use-of-ai-yet-again/1100-6537166/">Arc Raiders developers Embark</a> has continued to defend its deployment of AI text-to-speech models. <a dir="ltr" href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/lies-of-p-publisher-is-excited-about-ai-to-maximize-player-engagement/1100-6537198/">Lies of P publisher Neowitz</a> has touted its incorporation of AI to enhance productivity.

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/roblox">Roblox</a> has begun its global rollout of facial age verification onto the popular gaming platform starting today, in an attempt to improve child safety following a deluge of criticism. This comes after a partial rollout of the technology back in December.</p>
<p><a href="https://corp.roblox.com/newsroom/2026/01/roblox-age-checks-required-to-chat">In a blog post on the official Roblox website</a>, chief safety officer Matt Kaufman and VP of user discovery Rajiv Bhatia explained how these new age checks will work. Over the next week, users will find this new security measure added to Roblox as a barrier between them and the gaming platform's chat feature.</p>
<p>The blog post states: "As the first large online gaming platform to require facial age checks for users of all ages to access chat, this implementation is our next step toward what we believe will be the gold standard for communication safety. It enables age-based chat, which promotes a positive, age-appropriate experience for all users globally, and limits communication between adults and children younger than 16."</p>

<p>The post also features statistics <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/roblox-continues-efforts-for-child-safety-by-expanding-age-estimation-to-all-users-by-end-of-the-year">from its earlier partial rollout</a>. It claims that following the facial age verification implementation in Australia, New Zealand, and the Netherlands more than 50 percent of daily active users had completed the process.</p>
<p>For Roblox users younger than nine-years-old, parental permission will be required to use the chat functionality. Those aged 13 or older will be able to chat with those from a wider age group ranging from nine to seventeen thanks to what Roblox is calling their "Trusted Connections Feature". This age group will not be able to speak to those above or below that range, and similar restrictions are present for different detected age groups. Those over the age of 13 can instead verify their age using ID.</p><p>Roblox claims that user privacy is paramount, and that images taken to verify the age of users are deleted immediately after the security check is completed. <a href="https://en.help.roblox.com/hc/en-us/articles/37725513985812-Unlocking-Trusted-Connections-Expressive-Chat-Features-Party-Voice-chat-without-filters">On a Roblox help page dedicated to this Trusted Connections feature</a>, it states that occasionally users may have to redo this age verification process. In the event that the age verification software places a user into an age bracket that's incorrect, an appeal process is available where real-world ID or parental controls can manually circumvent the user's assigned age.</p>
<p>These age verification checks come following a period of intense scrutiny aimed at Roblox in regard to what many believe to be subpar efforts in child safety. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/louisiana-sues-roblox-for-allegedly-choosing-profits-over-child-safety-claiming-its-basically-open-season-for-sex-predators-on-this-app">The platform was sued by the state of Louisiana</a> last year over child safety, with Roblox's CEO previously <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/parents-worried-about-childrens-safety-shouldnt-let-them-play-roblox-company-boss-says">stating that parents not comfortable with their children playing the game shouldn't let them Roblox</a>. Months later, he would return to the forefront of this debate in a trainwreck interview, in which he stated <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/roblox-boss-says-problem-of-predators-is-an-opportunity-for-the-platform-in-disastrous-interview-following-latest-child-safety-measures">the game's predator problem was an "opportunity" for the platform</a>.</p>
<p>While undoubtedly a step in the right direction, this type of facial recognition technology has been circumvented by younger users in recent months. When the UK rolled out its online safety bill requiring larger websites to verify the ages of users, <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/hardware/brits-can-get-around-discords-age-verification-thanks-to-death-strandings-photo-mode-bypassing-the-measure-introduced-with-the-uks-online-safety-act-we-tried-it-and-it-works-thanks-kojima/">many used Norman Reedus in Death Stranding 2 to trick the facial recognition software</a>. Whether or not this is a great stride towards a safer Roblox for kids remains to be seen.</p>
