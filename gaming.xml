            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/16/24158246/sony-playstation-pc-overlay-hands-on<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Ghost of Tsushima Director’s Cut</em> debuts on PC today, and it’s the first game to feature Sony’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/17/24132846/sony-playstation-pc-overlay-shared-trophies-ghost-of-tsushima">new PlayStation PC overlay</a> and shared Trophies system. I’ve had a chance to get a first look at this new overlay, and my initial impression is that it’s really unobtrusive, clean, and simple.</p><p>There are five main sections here: search, friends, Trophies, profile, and settings. Search lets you find other PlayStation players and add them as friends, whereas the friends section lists both your online and offline friends. You can see your friends’ Trophies, but you can’t message friends or party chat from this overlay, unfortunately. You’ll have to use in-game chat if you want to speak to a console friend, or just use Discord.</p><div><figcaption><em>The PlayStation PC overlay in action.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>GIF by Tom Warren / The Verge</cite></p></div><p>The Trophies system works just as you’d expect, by syncing <em>Ghost of Tsushima Director’s Cut </em>trophies from the PS5 version of the game to PC, and vice versa. You just sign in to your PlayStation Network ID, and the overlay and Trophies are both available.</p><p>The profile section lets you view all your existing Trophies across all your PlayStation games, and the settings section is largely web links to account management, privacy settings, and PlayStation support. There are settings to enable or disable notifications for Trophies, and the ability to see who you’ve blocked on PSN.</p><p>Overall, the PlayStation PC overlay works much like Steam’s, in the sense that it’s only active within a game. Sony hasn’t created something that’s constantly running in the background like Nvidia’s GeForce Experience or Microsoft’s Xbox Game Bar. </p><div><figcaption><em>A trio of notifications will greet you if you haven’t disabled GeForce Experience and the Steam overlay pop-ups.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Screenshot by Tom Warren / The Verge</cite></p></div><p>I did notice that if you haven’t disabled notifications for the GeForce Experience and Steam overlays, then you’ll get a trio of pop-up notices when you start <em>Ghost of Tsushima Director’s Cut </em>because the PlayStation one also has its own notification<em>. </em>Unfortunately, there’s no way to disable the PlayStation notification, as the pop-up notifications toggle doesn’t affect this particular message.</p><p>Still, the overlay looks and feels lightweight, even if it’s a little basic right now. Nixxes Software, the in-house port developer that Sony acquired in 2021, helped create it, and I’m hoping this simple start will lead to even more features in the future. It sure would be great to have the option of using the voice chat features of the PlayStation Network instead of having to use in-game chat or Discord. Sony is increasingly investing in the PC space, so there’s a good chance this PlayStation overlay improves over time.</p><div><p><em>Ghost of Tsushima Director’s Cut </em>is available now <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fapp%2F2215430%2FGhost_of_Tsushima_DIRECTORS_CUT%2F">on Steam</a> and the <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/ghost-of-tsushima">Epic Games Store</a>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Centered around a cosmic tarot aesthetic, Astrologian is a healer role (one of four in the game) whose kit focuses heavily on drawing cards from a deck to perform actions. Each card has a particular buff that only activates when applied to a party member of a specific role. The randomness of card draws and the requirements for playing them gives Astrologian a particular sense of improvisation as it keeps players on their toes. You can’t just hit a regular rotation of skills if the game randomly gives you your next action. Compared to other healer roles, which can feel stagnant and a bit “set it and forget it”, Astrologian lets me get more involved as a player.</p><p>At least that was the case—once <em>Dawntrail </em>releases all that will change. “The card system will no longer be random,” reads the official change as shown during the live letter, “and will instead simultaneously draw cards with offensive, defensive, and curative effects.” In addition, players will now be able to draw four cards within a 60-second window that they can play depending on the given situation (players can currently draw one card every 30 seconds). Each card pulled will have curative, damage, or buffing abilities. The big issue, at least in this Astrologian’s opinion, is that these changes take away the best part of the job—the randomness.</p><figure id="" data-id="6b0e36caf15822dc4107c2cb0fb73a11" data-recommend-id="image://6b0e36caf15822dc4107c2cb0fb73a11" data-format="jpg" data-width="1141" data-height="643" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A lalafell draws a tarot card" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A lalafell draws a tarot card" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Square Enix</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="6b0e36caf15822dc4107c2cb0fb73a11" data-recommend-id="image://6b0e36caf15822dc4107c2cb0fb73a11" data-format="jpg" data-width="1141" data-height="643" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A lalafell draws a tarot card" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>For a while, there has been a slow, but steady, shift with many of <em>FF14</em>’s jobs towards making them simpler. Healers have faced the brunt of this shift, so much so that the community has identified it as <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-14-ff14-dawntrail-healer-job-rework-1851432853&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-14-ff14-dawntrail-healer-job-rework-1851432853">a major problem</a></span>. It isn’t an issue of whether <em>FF14 </em>is too hard or should be more friendly to newcomers— it’s very good at onboarding new adventurers, but it’s a question of job complexity. For healers, that complexity has felt lacking due to how relatively simple average healer gameplay is, which is often reduced to spamming attacks with one or two buttons and healing off the global cooldown with skills as needed. For new players, that simplicity can be helpful for learning the other many systems of the MMORPG but after hundreds of hours, it becomes boring.<br></p><p>Astrologian’s randomness has been a cure for healer boredom. While other healers have a fairly defined rotation, Astrologian has a built-in unpredictability that makes it exciting. For my first three expansions I played as a White Mage, but changed to Astrologian when I needed a job that gave me more to do in moment-to-moment combat. Making split-second decisions based on whatever the deck provides while in encounters makes healing a much more interesting affair and a much-needed alternative to other healing jobs. Taking that away feels like a major loss.</p><p>Although it wasn’t an entirely unexpected one. Ahead of <em>Dawntrail </em>players knew that Astrologian would be getting a rework, but were worried that it would be oversimplified, like the Summoner changes of Endwalker that sought to reduce the fabled two-minute rotation of the job into something easier to pick up. And honestly, it feels like our worries were valid with this erasure of card randomness. It’s part of a larger conversation about job simplification that even director <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-14-ff14-more-stressful-1851332485&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-14-ff14-more-stressful-1851332485">Naoki Yoshida has said</a></span> may have gone too far in recent updates.</p><hr><p>This doesn’t have to be an either-or situation though. That’s why we have multiple jobs, for multiple styles of play. There should be some jobs that allow for a more complex rotation for players who want that. This is why the coming changes to Astrologian feel like a loss.<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

According to Activision’s press release, the new studio will be focused “exclusively” on developing a “new narrative-based,” “genre-defining AAA franchise.” </p><p>That seems to imply that this new studio won’t be another gear in the enormous <em>Call of Duty</em> content creation machine, unlike Raven Software and High Moon Studios. Activision has made headlines over the years for essentially taking <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/now-every-single-activision-studio-works-on-call-of-dut-1846798677&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/now-every-single-activision-studio-works-on-call-of-dut-1846798677">all of its studios and throwing them into the <em>Call of Duty</em> mines</a></span>. Perhaps this time, things will be different.</p><p>“Built from the ground up, Elsewhere Entertainment is a premier and standalone studio dedicated to establishing an environment that inspires bold and diverse ideas. The team’s underlying mission encourages everyone to explore and collaborate creatively to craft a franchise with an enduring legacy that resonates far beyond games,” reads Activision’s press release, which was seemingly written by someone who was also trying to set a new record for most buzzwords used in one paragraph. </p><p>Activision says Elsewhere Entertainment features staff who have previously worked on games like <em>The Last of Us, Uncharted, The Witcher, Cyberpunk, The Division, Destiny, </em>and <em>Far Cry. </em>The studio has seemingly gone public now as it continues to staff up and likely ramps up development on its first big game.<br></p><h2 id="h8817"><a id=""></a>The timing of this news is not great, Bob</h2><p>Of course, the timing of this reveal hasn’t gone over well online. Activision’s parent company—Xbox—was recently in the news after it suddenly closed three Bethesda-owned studios on May 7. </p><p>Things only got worse for Xbox after an all-hands meeting with Bethesda leaked and reportedly revealed that the company had shut down those studios due to <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/xbox-bethesda-studio-closings-arkane-too-many-games-1851464885?rev=1715203138081&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-bethesda-studio-closings-arkane-too-many-games-1851464885?rev=1715203138081">resources and staff being spread too thin</a></span>. Xbox President Matt Booty reportedly said that shutting down these teams would help provide <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/xbox-bethesda-layoffs-high-impact-games-1851464703&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-bethesda-layoffs-high-impact-games-1851464703">more money and staff to  projects</a></span> as the company focuses on fewer, more “high-impact” games. </p><p>So, a big AAA studio being unveiled shortly after a bunch of people lost their jobs has gone over poorly online. And while Activision is its own large company with its own leaders and marketing plans, I understand why so many online are reacting poorly to the news. It’s likely that Activision was building Elsewhere Entertainment long before the Microsoft merger happened. But it’s extremely <em>unlikely </em>that Xbox leadership had no idea this studio existed or that it was going to be announced publicly around this time.</p><p>Personally, if I was an executive at <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reuters.com/technology/microsoft-hits-3-trillion-market-value-2024-01-24/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/microsoft-hits-3-trillion-market-value-2024-01-24/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">one of the biggest tech companies in the world</a></span>, I’d probably wait at least, like, I don’t know...a month after closing studios down before letting another part of the corporation reveal a big new video game studio, even if that means delaying plans that have been in the works for months. But hey, what do I know? </p><p>&nbsp;.<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Some videos were inspired by other artists’ renditions of Pokémon as <em>Animal Crossing </em>characters, including <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://twitter.com/Gokuchan/status/1230665049645010944&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://twitter.com/Gokuchan/status/1230665049645010944" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gokuchan</a></span>’s drawing of the electric sheep Mareep, and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://twitter.com/Yencatx/status/1156555444959080448&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://twitter.com/Yencatx/status/1156555444959080448" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Yencatx’s</a></span> Sylveon as an <em>Animal Crossing </em>fox.

But something like a life sim that lets you take care of <em>Pokémon </em>outside of capturing and battling with them feels like an untapped market.

<p data-characters="203" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">In preparation for&nbsp;<em>XDefiant’s&nbsp;</em>launch, Ubisoft <a href="https://twitter.com/PlayXDefiant/status/1791121436674801781" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">has disclosed</a> the PC specs to get players ready. So, let’s dive into what minimum and recommended system requirements are needed.&nbsp;</p> <h2 id="h-all-xdefiant-pc-requirements" data-injectable="false">All XDefiant PC requirements</h2> <p data-characters="174" data-current-count="174" data-injectable="false">The <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/when-can-you-preload-xdefiant/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">XDefiant</a> </em>PC specs include various systems, from the minimum to Ultra 4K requirements. To cover all the bases, we’ll break down each <em>XDefiant</em> PC system requirements:</p> <h3 id="h-minimum-xdefiant-pc-requirements" data-injectable="false">Minimum XDefiant PC requirements</h3> <ul data-found-items="6" data-current-count="414" data-injectable="true"> <li><strong>Resolution:</strong> 1080p</li> <li><strong>CPU:</strong> Intel i3-10105F/AMD Ryzen3 3100</li> <li><strong>GPU:</strong> Intel ARC A380 (6GB)/Nvidia GTX 1050Ti (4GB)/AMD RX 5500 XT (4GB)</li> <li><strong>RAM:</strong> 8GB (Dual channel)</li> <li><strong>OS:</strong> Win10</li> <li><strong>Storage: </strong>35GB</li> </ul>
 <h3 id="h-recommended-xdefiant-pc-requirements" data-injectable="false">Recommended XDefiant PC requirements</h3> <ul data-found-items="6" data-current-count="240" data-injectable="false"> <li><strong>Resolution:</strong> 1080p</li> <li><strong>CPU:</strong> Intel i3-10105F/AMD Ryzen3 3100</li> <li><strong>GPU:</strong> Intel ARC A750 (8GB)/Nvidia GTX 1060 (6GB)/AMD RX 5500 XT (8GB)</li> <li><strong>RAM:</strong> 16GB (Dual channel)</li> <li><strong>OS:</strong> Win10</li> <li><strong>Storage: </strong>35GB</li> </ul> <h3 id="h-enthusiast-xdefiant-pc-requirements" data-injectable="false">Enthusiast XDefiant PC requirements</h3> <ul data-found-items="6" data-current-count="480" data-injectable="true"> <li><strong>Resolution:</strong> 1440p</li> <li><strong>CPU:</strong> Intel i5-10400/AMD Ryzen5 3600</li> <li><strong>GPU:</strong> Intel ARC A770 (16GB)/Nvidia RTX 2060 (6GB)/AMD RX 5600 XT (6GB)</li> <li><strong>RAM:</strong> 16GB (Dual channel)</li> <li><strong>OS:</strong> Win10/Win11</li> <li><strong>Storage: </strong>35GB</li> </ul>
 <h3 id="h-ultra" data-injectable="false">Ultra</h3> <ul data-found-items="6" data-current-count="240" data-injectable="false"> <li><strong>Resolution:</strong> 4K</li> <li><strong>CPU:</strong> Intel i7-9700K/AMD Ryzen7 3700X</li> <li><strong>GPU:</strong> Nvidia RTX 3080 (10GB)/AMD RX 6800 XT (16GB)</li> <li><strong>RAM:</strong> 16GB (Dual channel)</li> <li><strong>OS:</strong> Win10/Win11</li> <li><strong>Storage: </strong>35GB</li> </ul> <p data-characters="330" data-current-count="570" data-injectable="true">The most convenient aspect of&nbsp;<em>XDefiant’s&nbsp;</em>PC specs is the low space requirement of just 35GB across the board. This means that even those with a high-end setup can rest assured, knowing that their storage won’t be overly burdened. Both DX11 and DX12 are also supported, giving you the freedom to choose.&nbsp;</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Ubisoft</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="352" data-current-count="652" data-injectable="true">For those curious about&nbsp;<em>XDefiant’s&nbsp;</em>frame rate, it’s worth noting that it remains uncapped for maximum FPS. However, the game also provides the option to cap the frame rate, which can be beneficial for improving performance. You can easily adjust these settings from <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/xdefiant-will-not-use-skill-based-matchmaking-in-casual-game-modes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the game’s</a> menu using your preferred specifications.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="400" data-current-count="400" data-injectable="true">Due to&nbsp;<em>XDefiant’s&nbsp;</em>online play, a stable internet connection is required. The PC version is also supported by NVIDIA Reflex, a technology that reduces system latency and offers better responsiveness in gameplay. This can be particularly beneficial in fast-paced games like <em>XDefiant</em>. Those with high latency may want to close other applications on their device to fix the problem.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="96" data-current-count="96" data-injectable="false">Besides the specs mentioned above, <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/ubisoft-cancels-development-on-the-division-heartland/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ubisoft</a> suggests having an SSD for the best experience.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>
US rapper Doja Cat has fired off a series of social media posts blasting "horrible" and "garbage" Fortnite players who use the game's powerful (many would say over-powered) Chains of Hades weapon. 
</p>
<p>
The Grammy Award-winning artist, whose hits include Say So, Paint the Town Red and Kiss Me More, posted a series of messages complaining about the Fortnite weapon in quick succession yesterday. A warning: Doja Cat uses extremely strong language which we reproduce below.
</p>
<p>
For the uninitiated, the Chains of Hades are a Greek god-themed whip weapon available this season with two uses: yoinking far-off players towards you, then following up with a blistering series of close-up swipes. They are really annoying... unless it's you using them.
</p>
<p>
Writing on social media platform X (<a href="https://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:https://twitter.com/dojacat/status/1790619105156030635">cached</a> by Google), Doja Cat had the following insight to share:
</p>
<p>
"If you're horrible and garbage at Fortnite make sure you grab a Chains of Hades whip to pass the time. Dumb cunts.
</p>
<p>
"If Fortnite knew what was good for them they'd get rid of Chains of Hades," she followed up with, two minutes later.
</p>
<p>
Responding to a fan who replied and said the Chains of Hades were their favourite weapon, Doja Cat <a href="https://twitter.com/lolm3gan/status/1790618760681762883">concluded</a>: "Because you're terrible."
</p>
<p>
Doja Cat is no stranger to Fortnite, and streams playing the game.
</p>
<p>
The artist is also featured in Fortnite via several songs featured in emotes ("Say So" was ubiquitous for a time, while the popular Joy skin - the game's first representation of a character with vitiligo - samples another Doja Cat track for its built-in emote).
</p>
<p>
Fortnite is even name-dropped in one of Doja Cat's tracks, Agora Hills. ('Cause love is pain, but I need this shit (Yeah) / We fuck too good when the bean kicks in / Like Fortnite, I'ma need your skin (Yeah) / Don't give a fuck where the penis been (Uh)'). 
</p>
<p>
So there's that.
</p>
<p>Earlier this week, Fortnite developer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnite-to-appeal-11m-fine-over-unfair-commercial-practices-aimed-at-children">Epic Games said it would appeal a €1.1m fine</a> from the Dutch consumer regulator over "unfair commercial practices aimed at children".</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/nvidia-rtx-remix-nfs-underground-mod-looks-stunning-in-new-video/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>One of the most impressive NVIDIA RTX Remix mods currently in development is certainly the <a href="https://www.moddb.com/mods/need-for-speed-underground-rtx-remix" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Need for Speed Underground RTX remaster by alessandro893</a>, which received another showcase video recently.</p>
<p>This NVIDIA RTX Remix mod features path-traced global/direct illumination, upscaled textures, and more than 1,000 lights added. Some textures were generated by Stable Diffusion. The modder said this is his first work, and he's working on it alone. It is an early Alpha version, though 80% of the lighting job is done. Some of the cars are matte, and only a few cars (Skyline, MX5) have headlights at this moment.</p>
<p>To install the NVIDIA RTX Remix NFS: Underground mod, follow this procedure. Download the latest version (v0.0.4a), then unzip and copy the content of the mod directory into the game's root folder, respecting this file hierarchy:</p>
<p>mod<br>
└ .trex<br>
└ d3d9.dll<br>
└ dinput8.dll<br>
└ dxvk.conf<br>
└ NvRemixLauncher32.exe<br>
└ rtx-remix<br>
└ rtx.conf<br>
└ scripts<br>
└ SNDSTREAMS (optional, lossless audio)<br>
└ Sound (optional, lossless audio)</p>
<p>The rendering resolution is set to 4K by default. To set a custom resolution, users may edit the "scripts/NFSUnderground.WidescreenFix.ini" file. As for the original video settings of Need for Speed: Underground, the modder recommends setting everything to High except shadows and reflections.</p>

<p>This week's NVIDIA GeForce NOW Thursday update also adds support for the first-person strategy game Colony Survival (on Steam), Tomb Raider: Definitive Edition (on the Xbox app and PC Game Pass), and, last but not least, 2024's earliest and most unexpected commercial success: <a href="https://wccftech.com/palworld-summer-update-new-pals/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Palworld</a>.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/my-favorite-anime-joaquim-dos-santos%E2%80%99-journey-from-macross-to-sword-of-the-stranger.873114/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/anime/24157255/my-favorite-anime-joaquim-dos-santos-macross-sword-of-the-stranger<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="LY1n4l">As an animator, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24094777/spider-man-across-spider-verse-director-interview-anime">Joaquim Dos Santos</a> has steadily carved out a career boasting credits on some of the most influential American animated series of the past two decades. The 46-year-old animator and director has gone from directing episodes of <em>Justice League: Unlimited</em> and <em>Avatar: The Last Airbender</em> to co-directing one of the biggest animated features of last year: <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/23742233/spider-man-across-spider-verse-review"><em>Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse</em></a>.</p>
<p id="Qg9xoJ">Polygon recently had a chance to connect with Dos Santos, so we had to ask: <strong>What was your first favorite anime, and what’s your favorite anime now?</strong></p>
<p id="sYQ9tc">My Favorite Anime is Polygon’s column dedicated to collecting the stories of the biggest celebrity anime fans in the world, charting a path from their earliest introductions to Japanese animation, to the series and films they love today. Here’s what Joaquim Dos Santos had to say.</p>
<hr id="cAqt2G">
<h2 id="ujt0Yk"><strong>What was your first favorite anime?</strong></h2>

<p id="Qflo5q">Premiering on Japanese TV in 1982, <em>Super Dimension Fortress Macross</em> was co-produced by Studio Nue and Artland and based on an original concept by Shoji Kawamori, who would go on to become one of the series’ principal mechanical designers. Inspired by <em>Mobile Suit Gundam</em>, <em>Macross</em> is a sci-fi mecha anime that follows Hikaru Ichijyo, a civilian fighter pilot, who enlists to fight in a war between humanity and a technologically advanced species known as the Zentradi. During the Human-Zentradi conflict, Hikaru meets and falls in love with Lynn Minmay, an idol singer whose music inadvertently proves to be a critical asset in humanity’s war effort.</p>
<div id="wG02ZS"><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/uY4fme_AvW4?rel=0" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share;"></iframe></p></div>
<p id="WvvuwD">The success of the original 36-episode series not only gave birth to the Macross anime franchise, but brought fame to three members of the show’s production staff: Kawamori, who would go on to be credited for popularizing the concept of transforming mecha in anime; Ichiro Itano, whose <a href="https://www.polygon.com/22370461/godzilla-vs-kong-anime-macross-plus">eponymous animation technique</a> would become synonymous with the Macross franchise and a widely recognized trope across Japanese animation; and Mari Iijima, the Japanese voice actress for Lynn Minmay, who successfully transitioned into a pop music career built in part on her character’s popularity.</p>
<p id="XGOngc"><em>Super Dimension Fortress Macross</em> has gained a reputation for its notorious inaccessibility in the West. Licensed by U.S. production company Harmony Gold USA, the original Macross anime was re-edited and broadcast in the United States as <em>Robotech</em> in 1985. In 2021, an agreement between Studio Nue and Harmony Gold USA <a href="https://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2021-04-08/big-west-studio-nue-harmony-gold-usa-agree-to-global-distribution-of-macross-robotech/.171570">was announced</a> that would allow the global distribution of most of the Macross television sequels and films.</p>
<h2 id="LaGdMy"><strong>What’s your favorite anime now?</strong></h2>

<p id="uGIOQW">Directed by Masahiro Ando, who was previously known for his work as storyboarder and animator for films like 1995’s <em>Ghost in the Shell</em> and 1997’s <em>End of Evangelion</em>, <em>Sword of the Stranger</em> is an action-adventure film known for its impressive fight sequences and cinematography. </p>
<p id="nOVQ6Y">Set during the Sengoku period, the movie follows the story of an orphan named Kotaro who, while on the run from a band of Ming warriors, crosses paths with a mysterious ronin who has vowed to never unsheathe his sword again. Desperate to elude his captors, Kotaro “hires” the ronin to act as his bodyguard. Meanwhile, Luo-Lang, the second-in-command of the Ming warriors pursuing Kotaro, remains relentless not only in his search for the boy, but for a worthy opponent.</p>
<div id="4jI7dU"><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jFh9M2iaxbA?rel=0" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share;"></iframe></p></div>
<p id="ivvO9h">Speaking to Polygon earlier this year, Dos Santos mentioned Yutaka Nakamura was one of his favorite Japanese animators. Nakamura is considered by many to be one of the preeminent action animators working in the anime industry, lauded for his work on shows like <em>Cowboy Bebop</em>, <em>Fullmetal Alchemist</em>, <em>My Hero Academia</em>, and <em>One Punch Man</em>, among many others. Nakamura also worked on several key action sequences in <em>Sword of the Stranger</em>, including the climactic duel between the film’s nameless protagonist and Luo-Lang, one of the most impressive sword fights in animation history.</p>
<p id="naCIto">The impact of both <em>Macross</em> and <em>Sword of the Stranger</em> on Dos Santos’ sensibilities as an animator and storyteller is plain to see for anyone familiar with his work. His attention to detail and cinematography are heavily anime-inspired, as is his proclivity for character-driven stories with large ensemble casts and an emphasis on stylish action sequences. The gift of good anime keeps on giving.</p>
<p id="4dc4AR"><small><em>Sword of the Stranger</em></small><small> is available to stream on Crunchyroll.</small><small><em> Super Dimension Fortress Macross</em></small><small> is currently not available to stream in the US.</small></p>

<p>Arena Breakout: Infinite is setting itself up to be a main challenger to juggernauts of the extraction shooter genre like Escape from Tarkov. But, after spending time playing the game’s closed beta, does it live up to the hype surrounding it, or are you better off sticking with what’s already out there?</p>



<h2 id="h-arena-breakout-infinite-review">Arena Breakout: Infinite Review</h2>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Arena Breakout Infinite Review | Buy, Wait, or Skip?" width="1200" height="675" src="about:blank" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/aHCykP9O47E?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>When you first load into Arena Breakout: Infinite, you’ll be welcomed by a series of tips and pointers to get your footing. If you’ve played Tarkov, you’ll immediately feel at home with how things are set up. You have your character – and militant, or SCAV –, your gear, supplies, traders, missions, and maps to choose from.  Again, all very familiar…for better or worse.</p>



<p>Outside of the action, the game’s user interface is friendlier than the ones it’ll often be compared to. Everything just seems easier to find. Quality-of-life features like quickly buying and equipping rations, easier storage organization, and even healing based on suggestions from the game are so nice that you’re left wondering why other games aren’t implementing these.</p>



<p>Even the after-match reports are special. After finishing a run, you’ll be shown a full report of everything that happened during the raid including a map that shows you everywhere you went and highlights key moments along with full breakdowns of every gunfight you were a part of.</p>



<figure></figure>



<h2 id="h-get-into-the-raid">Get Into The Raid</h2>



<p>Joining a raid is simple enough. You gear up, select your map, and choose whether you want to play Normal mode or enter the Forbidden Zone. Normal is the standard experience that’s more arcade-like in how people play while the Forbidden Zone caters to the more hardcore group of players. That’s likely because there’s far more to lose as not only do you have to pay Koen to enter, but your gear has to be worth at least 80,000 Koen.</p>



<p>Getting into raids took no time at all. The longest I waited was just about a minute to connect and deploy. There’s also a team system that, if you don’t already have a squad, will put you in one just as quickly. But should you not want to join a team, you can simply turn off automatching.</p>



<p>When in a raid, I’ll admit that it’s a mixed bag at this point. On the positive side of things, gun sounds are solid, and the use of your weapon feels pretty good. Submachine guns, shotguns, rifles, and pistols all feel different enough to add variety. </p>



<p>Gunplay itself feels strongest in close quarters. There was never a situation where I questioned how or why something happened in a gunfight. It all played out and felt exactly how I thought it should. At long distances, though, sometimes the guns just feel off. It’s kind of hard to explain without experiencing it yourself, but at times you feel like you’re aiming and using a BB gun as opposed to a rifle.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>The two playable maps in the beta – Farm and The Valley – are nice, but they’re nothing to write home about. They feel a bit boring and lack the personality that you see in the maps of Tarkov and even in Lamang in Gray Zone Warfare.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Speaking of Tarkov, there are a lot of one-to-one comparisons between the two with what’s offered. Like Tarkov, Arena Breakout: Infinite has traders who offer you missions as you progress. There are also items you can loot that are identical. Blue tape, anyone? I don’t want to compare too much to Tarkov here, but, I mean, that is the target audience for this game.</p>



<p>Going back to the gameplay, the AI feels a bit hit or miss. Sometimes, you’ll find yourself in a fun fight against a group or a boss like Ajax. Other times, well, you’ll just watch the AI run around aimlessly or stand there looking like a deer in headlights.</p>



<p>Visually, Unreal Engine 5 shines in making the game look good. There were some frame drop issues, but that’s something I chalk up to the game being in beta. </p>



<p>Of course, there’s the worry about monetization when the game fully launches. Being free-to-play means that microtransactions are coming. After all, the developers have to make money somehow. But how it works will be something to watch as it could turn the game into a pay-to-win experience.</p>



<figure></figure>



<h2 id="h-should-you-play-arena-breakout-infinite">Should You Play Arena Breakout: Infinite?</h2>



<p>At every step of the way, it’s clear that Arena Breakout: Infinite has its eyes set on both Escape from Tarkov and Gray Zone Warfare. The game offers several things that neither of its main competitors have while having gameplay that’s captivating enough to want to come back to.&nbsp;</p>



<p>At the end of the day, however, it’s going to come down to what else Morefun Games does to the gameplay and the out-of-raid experience that makes players want to come back rather than feel like they need to. Also, how the team attacks monetizing a PC audience will play a big role in the success of the game.</p>



<p>For now, though,&nbsp;Arena Breakout: Infinite is one game that all players <a href="https://www.arenabreakoutinfinite.com/en/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">need to keep an eye on</a> and get into as soon as the opportunity arises.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-16-best-board-games-for-couples-to-play-in-2024.873105/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/best-board-games-for-couples<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>While there are plenty of <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-2-player-board-games"><u>two-player board games</u></a> that are excellent, board games for couples to play together deserve their own special sub-category. A lot of two-player games are pretty hardcore <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-war-board-games"><u>war board games</u></a> or abstracts, for example, which are difficult categories for couples to agree over. Even if you can avoid such niche picks, two-player games also have a tendency to be fiercely competitive, which might also be a bad idea unless you’re both super forgiving. So here are our picks of the best games that balance the competitive and the cooperative, and the luck with the strategy, just so you can find a sweet spot to enjoy together.</p><h3>TL;DR The Best Board Games for Couples</h3><ul data-cy="list"><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/3w7Xw" target="_blank">Race to the Raft</a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/jdZwP" target="_blank">Sky Team</a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/7L5YE" target="_blank">The Search for Lost Species</a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/NwjJd" target="_blank">Fog of Love</a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/8OxLd" target="_blank">Patchwork</a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/1gZ6n" target="_blank">Codenames Duet</a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/pPAX0" target="_blank">The Adventures of Robin Hood</a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/3qlR3" target="_blank">Hive</a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/Gymgq" target="_blank">Onitama</a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/pPA7l" target="_blank">Five Tribes</a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/w4NRR" target="_blank">The Fox in the Forest</a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/RpwnK" target="_blank">7 Wonders: Duel</a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/NwjJd" target="_blank">Schotten Totten</a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/R6YmE" target="_blank">Splendor: Duel</a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/lVLMP" target="_blank">Sea Salt &amp; Paper</a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/GYwAE" target="_blank">Dorfromantik: The Board Game</a></li></ul><h2>Race to the Raft</h2><div id="195588"><p><h3>Race to the Raft</h3></p></div><p>Some of you may remember the movement puzzle games that were popular in the early days of the internet: they’re a clear predecessor to this bright and absorbing board game about guiding finicky cats to safety. Each cat will only travel over one colour of terrain, so it’s your job to work together to build a path for it to reach a raft before a blazing fire cuts it off. Your goal is hampered by the random nature of terrain cards you draw, the likelihood you’ll cut off another cat’s route with each play, and limited communication rules that may see you meowing desperately at one another to try and get a point across. Both challenging and hilarious, the game offers more than 80 scenarios of ever-increasing difficulty. </p><h2>Sky Team: Prepare for Landing</h2><div id="195589"><p><h3>Sky Team: Prepare for Landing</h3></p></div><p>What better way to say “I love you” than to take a flight together to an exotic destination? That’s what you get to do in Sky Team, with the notable catch that you’re playing as the pilot and co-pilot, and you have to work together to land the plane first. It’s far harder than it sounds: both of you have your own pool of dice and sets of instruments you must attend to using the results. Some of them even require you to balance the two values assigned by each player, a task made even trickier by the fact you can’t discuss strategy during the placement phase. At least that should avoid the potential for arguments when you find the dice pool is running short, the plane is tilting at a dangerous angle and there’s a queue of air traffic in front of you for the runway.</p><h2>The Search for Lost Species</h2><div id="195590"><p><h3>The Search for Lost Species</h3></p></div><p>Boasting an appealing theme and an ever-shifting puzzle dynamic, this app-driven game sees players racing to map the ecology of an island and discover a long-lost animal. This engaging skin hides a logic puzzle of fiendish complexity. Each animal on the island has several rules dictating where it lives: some of them are fixed and some change from game to game, revealed by the app as the players research. They must use these rules, and clues from their island exploration, to figure out what hexes hold which species and slowly pin down the location of the mysterious beast. It’s complex but plays quickly once mastered, and every game is a fresh puzzle thanks to the app. You can even work together against the app, although you’ll have to share one playing piece.</p><h2>Fog of Love</h2><div id="155164"><p><h3>Fog of Love</h3></p></div><p>We have to start a list like this with a game designed specifically to tell the story of a couple in a relationship. However, it isn’t your relationship but one that you’ll create between a pair of fictitious characters and then go on to explore its nuances and ups and downs. Although there’s a certain amount of blue and pink in the visuals it’s also open to same-sex relationships, too. Your couple each get a brew of secret traits and destinies and then go on to play through a number of scenes, making choices based on traits that affect the outcome. As an experimental game, there is no winner here in the strict sense, but you’ll win by enjoying a fascinating journey through an imagined relationship instead.</p><h2>Patchwork</h2><div id="162166"><p><h3>Patchwork</h3></p></div><p>Patchwork works because it’s a super simple synthesis of several clever concepts in one small package. Players buy geometric pieces using buttons to try and form a quilt with as few holes in it as possible. Each purchase also moves you forward on a time track, which intermittently earns you extra buttons or very useful single-square patches for your quilt, but the person last on the time track always takes the next turn. This lets you set up interesting plays like planning for double turns or trying to leapfrog your opponent to snatch a one-square patch. Gently addictive while it transfixes several parts of your brain at once, it’s no wonder it won a slew of awards and nominations.</p><h2>Codenames Duet</h2><div id="162167"><p><h3>Codenames Duet</h3></p></div><p>The original <a href="https://zdcs.link/kvOK6" target="_blank">Codenames</a> was a rare breakout hit into the wider world of <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-board-games-for-parties-and-large-groups">party games</a>. Players laid out a grid of cards with words on them. Then one player per team had to give out single-word clues to try and link multiple words together in order to help their teammates identify which cards were coded to their side. Codenames: Duet is very similar but it’s been refined for two into a much sleeker <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-cooperative-board-games">cooperative game</a>. Now you’re trying to find fifteen clues between you before a timer runs out. Because you both take turns giving clues, downtime while someone thinks of a clue to give is almost eliminated, bringing a fun slice of party game magic to the table with just the two of you.</p><h2>The Adventures of Robin Hood</h2><div id="162168"><p><h3>The Adventures of Robin Hood</h3></p></div><p>Unlike the other games on this list, The Adventures of Robin Hood is a narrative-driven title where you retell the legend of the famous outlaw across nine scenarios. But it brings all sorts of clever ideas to the formula, making it intriguing and engaging to play. There are no board spaces for starters: instead, you measure your progress across the map with a long base on your wooden playing piece, trying to stay in printed shadows and out of sight of guards. The board is like an advent calendar, with hundreds of numbered pieces you can lift out and flip over to create the feel of a living, dynamic world you encounter by looking up the numbers in the included book. Can you and your partner work together to save Nottingham from the clutches of the evil Sheriff before Guy of Gisborne hunts you down? </p><h2>Hive</h2><div id="162169"><p><h3>Hive</h3></p></div><p>Played with delightful chunky plastic hexes, Hive is a game with an unfortunate tendency to make your skin crawl thanks to its insectoid subject matter. On the plus side, it also makes your brain crawl in all the best ways with its ever-escalating web of interlocking strategies. Each player has a Queen hex and you win by surrounding your opponent’s Queen with your pieces. There are four other types of insects, each with its own movement rules that you must leverage in pursuit of your goal. There are only eleven tiles on each side, which enter play one by one, and the Hive itself must always be a single conglomeration of tiles. That makes Hive easy to transport, set up and play, but the complex interaction of movement rules makes it devilishly hard to win.</p><h2>Onitama</h2><div id="162170"><p><h3>Onitama</h3></p></div><p>Onitama gets a lot of mileage out of a very simple idea. It’s played on a grid where each player starts with a master pawn and five students. Moving any of your pieces onto an opponent’s piece knocks it off the board and you win either by knocking out the enemy master or moving your own master to the opposite end of the board. The kicker is that the legal moves for your pieces depend on a random deal of cards: you have a choice of two each turn and the one you pick is discarded and refreshed from an extra card from the side of the board. This creates a fascinating and challenging interplay of cause and effect where you can see the likely path to plan ahead but the ever-changing roster of potential moves muddy the waters. </p><h2>Five Tribes</h2><div id="162171"><p><h3>Five Tribes</h3></p></div><p>You may have played the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-classic-board-games">classic board game</a> Mancala where you grab a handful of beads from a pit and pop one each in the following sequence of pits. Five Tribes translates this concept into a modern strategy game played on a grid of tiles. Each handful you pick up will consist of multiple color pieces and the final tile you drop one on determines what actions you take for that round. However, the changed board state then determines possible combinations for the next player to take, making each turn a mind-bending puzzle of balancing your own needs against your opponent’s opportunities. Add in an auction to determine the first player and you’ve got a modern classic. With two, Five Tribes lets you double your turns meaning there’s a whole other layer of using your first turn to set yourself up for a combo second turn.</p><h2>The Fox in the Forest</h2><div id="162172"><p><h3>The Fox in the Forest</h3></p></div><p>If you’ve ever played a traditional trick-taking game like Whist you might be baffled that such a thing could work with two. Yet that’s what The Fox in the Forest achieves thanks to its three-suit deck in which even-numbered cards work like standard playing cards, but odd-numbered cards all have a special power. The 3-value Fox, for instance, lets you change the trump suit while the 9-value Witch is treated as always being a trump. Its other clever coup is the scoring system which rewards you for winning either the majority or the minority of tricks, making it very hard to eke out a lead unless you can time your wins to perfection. Fast, fun and innovative, The Fox in the Forest is an incredible answer to a seemingly impossible question.</p><h2>7 Wonders: Duel</h2><div id="162173"><p><h3>7 Wonders: Duel</h3></p></div><p>While the original <a href="https://zdcs.link/e1jK6" target="_blank">7 Wonders</a> was a smash hit by itself, this two-player refinement is widely regarded as being even better. The core concept is the same: you’re drafting cards to make point-scoring sets representing aspects of an ancient civilization. Different types of cards represent different aspects such as military, technology or wonders of the world, and will give you bonuses and resources when added to your tableau. However, instead of the standard pick and pass drafting of the original game, 7 Wonders: Duel instead has players drafting from a pyramid of overlapping cards, most of which start face down and only become available when the cards atop them are taken. This adds a wonderful element of timing to the draft as you balance taking your best picks against giving more options to your opponent.</p><h2>Schotten Totten</h2><div id="155160"><p><h3>Schotten Totten 2</h3></p></div><p>A classic from back in 1999, Schotten Totten still holds up well today. Its central idea is that you’re battling across nine stones with each player trying to create Poker-style three-card combos on their own side, one card at a time. This creates the most delicious tension as your opponent wonders what meld you’re aiming for, and you worry whether you’ll draw the right cards to complete it. Just like Poker itself, there’s plenty of strategy in playing the probabilities, plus there’s an extra deck of special power tactics cards to spice things up. And if that wasn’t enough for you, you can also use the cards with their amusing cartoon art to play a completely different game called <a href="https://zdcs.link/GymrV" target="_blank">Lost Cities</a>.</p><h2>Splendor Duel</h2><div id="195790"><p><h3>Splendor: Duel</h3></p></div><p>The original Splendor, one of the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-engine-building-board-games">best engine building games</a> around, already worked well with two, so you might wonder why a version exists that feels like it was specifically created for couples. The answer is that the refinements to the core gameplay loop make it better in every respect. You’re still master jewellers, trying to create the most beautiful works for your noble clientele, each one of which enriches your purchases power against future masterpieces. But you’re now picking your raw gems off a board, with placement rules, vying against three different victory conditions, and working with a slew of simple but highly significant special effects to vary your strategies. The result is a fantastic dance of two-player delight, which is ideal over the original if you’re only planning to play with your significant other.
</p><h2>Sea Salt &amp; Paper</h2><div id="200703"><p><h3>Sea Salt &amp; Paper</h3></p></div><p>This is a delightful abstract card game from prolific designer Bruno Cathala which combines several classic gameplay elements in one simple package. You take a card each turn, either randomly off the deck or a face-up one from a discard pile, and your aim is to build sets, which will score you points. Pairs of certain cards can be played for a special effect like taking an extra card or stealing one from an opponent, although that reveals some of your points to the whole table. Why does this matter? Because it's up to the players when the hand ends, and they can gamble they’ve got a winning combo at the potential cost of a lot of their points! While this classic small-box game works with a group, it’s best, fastest and most balanced with a cosy couple and, as a bonus, you can both appreciate its absolutely unique origami artwork, specially commissioned for the game.
</p><h2>Dorfromantik: The Board Game</h2><div id="186796"><p><h3>Dorfromantik: The Board Game</h3></p></div><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>Age Range: </strong>8+</li><li><strong>Players: </strong>1-6</li><li><strong>Playtime: </strong>30-60 mins</li></ul><p>Dorfromantik the video game gained a deserved reputation as a pleasantly relaxing puzzle in which you could build your own slice of rural utopia hex by hex. This board game adaptation brings the same vibe to one or several players as you work together, taking one tile at a time and trying to complete as many groups of similar terrain features as you can before the pile runs out. It has a trick up its sleeve: a delightfully addictive campaign mode that sees you climbing a tree of different reveals, adding a slow drip of straightforward but highly impactful new content to your game. These come in little boxes that you break open with each reveal, and there’s a particular pleasure in sharing your new discoveries with a partner, so you can coo over your new toys without the excitement getting lost in the crowd, before you move on to your next tile-laying escapade.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/the-best-dungeons-and-dragons-books<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>It’s safe to say that Dungeons &amp; Dragons is enjoying something of a golden age. Between the renewed popularity for the hobby brought on by Stranger Things to the success of the Honor Among Thieves movie, from the explosion of tabletop-focused podcasts and YouTube shows to the massive popularity of <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-review">Baldur’s Gate 3</a> last year, there’s seriously never been a better time to start rolling for initiative.</p><p>But navigating the nearly decade-long reign of the Fifth Edition of Dungeons &amp; Dragons (AKA 5E) can be a bit difficult for newcomers to digest, especially owing to the plethora of high quality content being put out by third-party creators. If you’ve recently decided to get into the hobby, but don’t know where to start, here’s our recommendations on the best Dungeons &amp; Dragons books in 2024. You can also check out our <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/how-to-play-dungeons-and-dragons">beginner's guide to D&amp;D</a> for additional tips.</p><h2>First-Party Content</h2><p>A few disclaimers before we dive in! First, this guide will primarily focus on first-party content, since there’s a dizzying amount of third-party content that mostly is geared towards D&amp;D veterans looking to spice up bog standard dungeon crawling. Secondly, we’re going to be excluding the three most essential books: <a href="https://zdcs.link/yN3pw?_ga=2039368431.1689096814" target="_blank"><strong>The</strong> <strong>Player’s Handbook</strong></a>, the <a href="https://zdcs.link/bN5yx?_ga=2039368431.1689096814" target="_blank"><strong>Dungeon Master’s Guide</strong></a>, and the <a href="https://zdcs.link/nJlyx?_ga=2039368431.1689096814" target="_blank"><strong>Monster Manual</strong></a>. While all three of these books are great (and have exciting <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-biggest-changes-coming-to-dds-core-rulebooks-overhaul">new versions</a> slated for later this year), it’s probably not particularly helpful to recommend them, since you’ll obviously want those basics before diving deeper. If you don’t have those three core rulebooks, you should get them.</p><p>Here are the best Dungeons &amp; Dragon books worth having in 2024 and beyond:</p><h3>Xanathar’s Guide to Everything (Sourcebook)</h3><div id="189104"><p><h3>Xanathar's Guide to Everything</h3></p></div><p>Quite possibly the most essential sourcebook since it was published in 2017, this expansion focuses on providing additional player options, including over 25 subclasses, 20 racial feats, new spells, and more. It also includes some helpful tools for the game master (like building traps) and some optional rules to flesh out some concepts from the core rulebooks (like playing through downtime).</p><p>Admittedly though, this sourcebook is more useful to players than it is to game masters, but if you want your party to have more options, you’d be hard-pressed to find a better sourcebook than this one. If you want Wizards who can learn War Magic, Paladins who have made an Oath of Redemption, or most importantly, Monks who can master drunken fighting style, you’re going to want to add this sourcebook to your collection immediately.</p><h3>Tasha’s Cauldron of Everything (Sourcebook)</h3><div id="189105"><p><h3>Tasha's Cauldron of Everything</h3></p></div><p>Similar to Xanathar’s Guide to Everything, this sourcebook is all about providing more player options and expanding upon ideas from the core rulebooks. <a href="https://www.wargamer.com/dnd/classes" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Every class</a> gets access to optional class features, there’s a whole host of new spells to peruse, and the game master can look forward to considering new rules for sidekicks, natural hazards, parlaying with monsters, and supernatural environments.</p><p>Again, most of the options in this one are geared towards players, but we consider this an essential part of injecting some class diversity into your milquetoast D&amp;D party.</p><h3>Waterdeep: Dragon Heist (Adventure)</h3><div id="189106"><p><h3>Waterdeep: Dragon Heist</h3></p></div><p>One of the coolest adventures published by Wizards of the Coast, this roleplay-heavy quest is filled with intrigue and deadly feuds. While many D&amp;D adventures are filled with dungeon crawls and loads of monsters to fight, we prefer journeys that are packed with social encounters, political conflict, and subterfuge, and Waterdeep provides just that in one fantastic package.</p><p>The adventure begins when a famous explorer ensnares the party in a bitter conflict between two criminal enterprises, with the promise of great riches that lie hidden somewhere in the city’s shadowy corners. Also, the book offers four possible antagonists, which can be swapped out by the game master depending on their preference – a neat little feature that allows for surprises even if players have played or seen other groups play the adventure before.</p><p>Also, if you like this adventure, there’s a direct follow-up called <a href="https://dnd.wizards.com/products/waterdeep-dungeon-of-the-mad-mage" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Waterdeep: Dungeon of the Mad Mage</a>. As the name suggests, it has a significantly different vibe (trading intrigue for dungeons), but it at least provides some options for an extended campaign.</p><h3>Planescape: Adventures in the Multiverse (Sourcebook/Adventure Bundle)</h3><div id="189107"><p><h3>Planescape: Adventures in the Multiverse</h3></p></div><p>Planescape, the multiversal setting that sits at the center of the Forgotten Realms, is one of D&amp;D’s most interesting worlds (not to mention the setting for <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/1999/12/18/planescape-torment"><u>Planescape: Torment, one of the all-time greatest RPGs</u></a>), and this collection of three sourcebooks absolutely knocks it out of the park.</p><p>If you’re concerned that the three-book bundle follows in the disappointing footsteps of <a href="https://dnd.wizards.com/products/spelljammer" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Spelljammer</a> – fear not – clearly Wizards of the Coast has heard the feedback loud and clear and this expansion doesn’t skimp out on the details. The setting book, Sigil and the Outlands, is bursting with setting details from major landmarks to my personal favorite: factions (complete with extremely troubling philosophies). The setting’s monster manual, Morte’s Planar Parade, provides plenty of options for GMs to throw at their PCs during a campaign in Sigil, and the adventure, Turn of Fortune’s Wheel, goes some really interesting places.</p><p>All-in-All, this sourcebook bundle has really impressed us, and makes great use out of one of D&amp;D’s best settings. We love it and think you will too.</p><h3>Phandelver and Below: The Shattered Obelisk (Adventure)</h3><div id="189108"><p><h3>Phandelver and Below: The Shattered Obelisk</h3></p></div><p>Another recent release is the massive expansion to <a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/sources/lmop" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Lost Mine of Phandelver</a>, an adventure that was many tabletop players’ first foray into the magical universe of D&amp;D. Phandelver and Below takes players back to the frontier town of Phandalin to dive deeper into the mystery of the magical obelisks found throughout the land. Throughout the course of this lengthy campaign, the party will unravel a conspiracy that’s worse than anything they could have imagined, when mystery becomes cosmic horror.</p><p>Honestly, this adventure is unlike anything Wizards has published in the past, and with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Illithid" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mind Flayers</a> taking a central role in the narrative, hot on the heels of Baldur’s Gate 3, combined with the nostalgia hit of Phandalin, this is one of the best campaigns to run right now.</p><h3>Eberron: Rising from the Last War (Sourcebook/Adventure)</h3><div id="189109"><p><h3>Eberron: Rising from the Last War</h3></p></div><p>This setting sourcebook is set in a war torn world with floating castles, skyscrapers, and airships, and is one of the more unique setting options to consider if you’d like to stray from the basics of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forgotten_Realms" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Forgotten Realms</a>. There’s some really cool stuff packed in this one, including some new species options called Dragonmarks.</p><p>The pulpy post-war vibes in this setting offer lots of opportunities for roleplay-focused groups, but also plenty of swashbuckling goodness as well. The package also includes a campaign that focuses on Mournland, a creepy place that’s rife with not-so-fun magic. We’ll leave it at that, for now….</p><h3>Dragonlance: Shadow of the Dragon Queen (Adventure)</h3><div id="189110"><p><h3>Dragonlance: Shadow of the Dragon Queen</h3></p></div><p>This adventure also introduces a new (at least to 5E) setting, Dragonlance, which was recently incorporated into <a href="https://dnd.wizards.com/products/the-practically-complete-guide-to-dragons" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Practically Complete Guide to Dragons</a> lorebook. If you dream of mass combat encounters featuring lots of enemies warring with one another and dragons laying waste to numerous foes, this is the book for you.</p><p>The adventure is quite lengthy, and focused on the death knight Lord Soth and his frightening army of draconians as the primary antagonist. There’s also some new player options to boot!</p><h3>Curse of Strahd (Adventure)</h3><div id="189111"><p><h3>Curse of Strahd</h3></p></div><p>One of the OG adventures from Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons, this classic gothic horror is a remake of a very old adventure from the first edition of the game. It’s got vampires! It’s got blood! It’s got really creepy toys you probably shouldn’t interact with, but probably will! What’s not to like?</p><p>If you enjoy this one, there’s also a supplement to support the setting called <a href="https://zdcs.link/xRNpx" target="_blank"><strong>Van Richten’s Guide to Ravenloft</strong></a>, though honestly, it’s vampires hanging out in castles – you probably get the idea without needing to read a whole book on the matter.</p><h3>The Wild Beyond the Witchlight (Adventure)</h3><div id="189112"><p><h3>The Wild Beyond the Witchlight: A Feywild Adventure</h3></p></div><p>Did we mention we like adventures with lots of roleplaying potential? Because another great option for doing just that is The Wild Beyond the Witchlight, an adventure that takes place in the Feywild setting that’s got a pretty cool carnival going on where nothing untoward is going on – probably. This one’s a lot of fun for parties that like having multiple options for solving a problem, not all of which include physical violence.</p><p>The book also offers two new playable species and some additional backgrounds to go with them. You can even decide to be a carny, meaning your character’s dreams of running away to join the circus can now become a reality – or a background.</p><h2>Third-Party Content</h2><p>Okay, okay – we know we were supposed to keep this thing limited to first-party stuff, since there’s just too much to cover in the third-party space, but we can’t help but name drop just a few quick titles you should consider checking out, including:</p><p><strong></strong><a href="https://shop.mcdmproductions.com/products/strongholds-followers-pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Strongholds and Followers</strong></a>, a sourcebook published by MCDM Productions that adds rules for GMs to give their parties bases and NPC friendlies. This book was so good that Wizards seems to be cribbing from it with their much more player-focused Bastion rules that will debut in next year’s revisions for the core rulebooks.</p><p><strong></strong><a href="https://shop.mcdmproductions.com/collections/flee-mortals-the-mcdm-monster-book" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Flee, Mortals!</strong></a><strong>,</strong> a monster manual published by MCDM Productions that redesigns lots of D&amp;D monsters to be more interesting and adds some new ones to boot. It also has a companion book called <a href="https://shop.mcdmproductions.com/collections/where-evil-lives-the-mcdm-book-of-boss-battles" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Where Evil Lives</a> that provides a single dungeon for groups to enjoy.</p><p><strong></strong><a href="https://koboldpress.com/kpstore/product/creature-codex-for-5th-edition-dnd/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Tome of Beasts/Creature Codex</strong></a>, monster manuals published by Kobold Press that add even more monsters to the mix. The three volumes of Tome of Beasts are particularly useful for high-level groups looking for endgame challenges.</p><p><strong></strong><a href="https://ghostfiregaming.com/product-category/game/grim-hollow/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Grim Hollow</strong></a>, a dark fantasy setting created by Ghostfire Gaming that brings players into a much grimmer world of war, dark magic, and plagues. If you want to step out of the basic D&amp;D settings, this is definitely one to consider. Plus, they’ve got plenty of books to support the setting, so you can dive in as deep as you like!</p><p>And there you have it! Those are our top recommendations for the books you should consider buying in 2024. What do you think? Are there any of your favorites that we missed?

<p data-characters="391" data-injectable="true" data-video="true"><em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/tag/destiny-2/">Destiny 2</a></em> players, myself included, are eager to get their hands on the now-craftable Exotic pulse rifle, Outbreak Perfected. While completing the <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/destiny-2-zero-hour-rewards-and-loot/">Zero Hour</a> mission on Normal is enough to receive the weapon, it’s not enough to unlock the craftable perks. Those come from weekly missions where Guardians must hunt down switches. Here is the first set of switches for Outbreak Refined I.</p> <h2 id="h-where-are-the-switches-in-outbreak-refined-i" data-injectable="false">Where are the switches in Outbreak Refined I?</h2> <p data-characters="276" data-current-count="276" data-injectable="false">After going through the Covert Passage into the open space with the ship, there will be a series of vents on your right. Proceed to the row furthest away from you and turn around to face the way you came. You’ll see an opening in the left corner where you can jump down.</p> <figure data-current-count="576" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="387" data-current-count="387" data-injectable="false">Follow the path until you jump down a silo with two crossed catwalks at the bottom. There will be a pair of Fallen Captains below that need to be eliminated. In each corner of this room are switches that will open hatches in the next room. Additionally, there is a switch in the middle of a wall, above a piece of machinery. Remember this switch as you’ll need to press it shortly.</p> <figure data-current-count="687" data-injectable="true"><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/destiny-2-zero-hour-outbreak-refined-002.jpg"></a><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="150" data-current-count="150" data-injectable="false">Kitty corner from that switch will be a passage lined with red pipes on the wall. Go there and activate that switch to open Hatch 03 in the next room.</p> <figure data-current-count="450" data-injectable="true"><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/destiny-2-zero-hour-outbreak-refined-003.jpg"></a><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="324" data-current-count="324" data-injectable="false">After activating the Hatch 03 switch, proceed into the next room. There will be a large gap between you and the next wall. Jump over to the sluice and up it to reach the platform on top where you’ll see the opened Hatch 03. Hop atop the lid of the hatch and use it to reach the vertical strip of platforms in the silo.</p> <figure data-current-count="624" data-injectable="true"><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/destiny-2-zero-hour-outbreak-refined-004.jpg"></a><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="476" data-current-count="476" data-injectable="true">At the top of the silo will be a darkened room with a switch on the wall. This is one of two switches needed, with the other being the first switch I mentioned. You can press them in either order, but I find it’s much quicker to activate this switch first, jump down the silo, and run back to the first switch. Once activated, you’ll see “Catalyst Switch Primed” with a 30-second timer. Reach the second switch within that window to complete this step.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/destiny-2-zero-hour-outbreak-refined-005.jpg"></a><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="301" data-current-count="601" data-injectable="false">The remaining step for Outbreak Refined I is to complete Zero Hour on Legend. Due to the tight time limit, I recommend heading back to orbit and restarting the activity once everyone has completed this first step.

            <p>
Activision has announced a new game development studio opened in Poland named Elsewhere Entertainment.
</p>
<p>
Based in Warsaw with additional resources in the US, the studio is developing a "new narrative-based and genre-defining AAA franchise".
</p>
<p>
It's the second Activision studio in the country after the Krakow-based Infinity Ward Poland and, while this is its public unveiling, it's already been working on its first project.

</div><figcaption>Newscast: Is the closure of Hi-Fi Rush and Redfall's studios a sign the Xbox Game Pass publishing model is failing?<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Dx4fu4H6us" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>
That explains why a new studio announcement comes a week after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-shuts-slew-of-bethesda-studios-including-redfall-hi-fi-rush-developers">Microsoft closed Bethesda studios Arkane Austin, Tango Gameworks, and Alpha Dog Games</a>. Microsoft's subsidiaries have separate budgets and <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/activision-and-microsoft-are-opening-a-new-game-studio-in-poland-elsewhere-entertainment-with-a-totally-new-ip">Windows Central</a> reports Elsewhere has been operating for some time.
</p>
<p>
So what new project could Elsewhere be working on? There are no details yet beyond it being "narrative-based", with the studio aiming to craft a "franchise with an enduring legacy that resonates far beyond games". It certainly sounds ambitious.
</p>
<p>
The studio includes "storytelling experts" from franchises like The Last of Us, The Witcher, Cyberpunk 2077, Uncharted, Far Cry and more. It is not working on a Call of Duty game.
</p>
<p>
The studio is also seeking talent to join its ranks, so presumably its first project remains a long way off.
</p>
<p>
It's certainly some positive news after last week's shock closures. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-president-responds-to-studio-closures-as-commitment-to-make-sure-that-the-business-is-healthy-for-the-long-term">Xbox president Sarah Bond responded</a> soon afterwards in an interview with Bloomberg, describing studio closures as a "commitment to make sure that the business is healthy for the long term".

</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hi-fi-rush-creator-praised-good-situation-in-our-studio-and-freedom-of-risk-taking-a-month-before-closure">Hi-Fi Rush creative director John Johanas</a> had described a "good situation in our studio" just a month ahead of its closure.

  <p id="iSYIY4">We are thrilled to announce Polygon’s latest book: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Year-Ring-Susana-Polo/dp/B0CTYGTKC6/ref=tmm_hrd_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&amp;qid=&amp;sr=&amp;tag=polygon05-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank" has-subtag="true" data-cdata="{&quot;rewritten_url&quot;:&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Year-Ring-Susana-Polo/dp/B0CTYGTKC6/ref=tmm_hrd_swatch_0?ascsubtag=___pl__p_23920713__m_m-placeholder__s_s-placeholder__t_w__c_c-placeholder__r_r-placeholder__d_d-placeholder\u0026_encoding=UTF8\u0026qid=\u0026sr=\u0026tag=polygon05-20&quot;,&quot;subtag_max_length&quot;:99,&quot;subtag_delim_length&quot;:3,&quot;subtag_key&quot;:&quot;ascsubtag&quot;,&quot;subtag_data&quot;:{&quot;ascsubtag&quot;:&quot;___pl__p_23920713__m_m-placeholder__s_s-placeholder__t_w__c_c-placeholder__r_r-placeholder__d_d-placeholder&quot;,&quot;_encoding&quot;:&quot;UTF8&quot;,&quot;qid&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;sr&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;tag&quot;:&quot;polygon05-20&quot;},&quot;encode_subtag&quot;:false}"><em>Year of the Ring</em></a>, an in-depth exploration of Peter Jackson’s Lord of the Rings trilogy and the books that inspired them. <em>Year of the Ring</em> — <a href="https://www.polygon.com/year-of-the-ring">authored by Susana Polo and a variety of Polygon contributors</a> — will hit stores on Oct. 15, 2024, kicking off Polygon Pages, an ongoing publishing partnership with Insight Editions.</p>
<p id="60BZl2">Here’s how our publisher describes the book: </p>
<blockquote><p id="WNmJfp"><em>Year of the Ring</em> is a beautiful hardcover volume that chronicles the origins and incarnations of J.R.R. Tolkien’s foundational text as it has wended its way towards leaving an indelible stamp on pop culture. The book charts the history of Lord of the Rings from Tolkien’s original books up through Peter Jackson’s landmark trilogy of adaptations and the lasting cultural impact they’ve all left on mass culture. <em>Year of the Ring</em> is an absolute treasure trove for fans of the series and those of us out there who’ve found Tolkien’s fantastically imaginative world difficult to leave.</p></blockquote>
<p id="I8Eych">The book pulls from Polygon’s yearlong <a href="https://www.polygon.com/year-of-the-ring">Year of the Ring editorial package</a>, in which Polo partnered with writers, authors, and fans to revisit the iconic films in new ways. Molly Ostertag wrote about <a href="https://www.polygon.com/lord-of-the-rings/22550950/sam-frodo-queer-romance-lord-of-the-rings-tolkien-quotes">queer readings</a> of the series. The “other” actor who played Gimli <a href="https://www.polygon.com/lord-of-the-rings/22535564/lotr-gimli-actor-double-brett-beattie-cast-fellowship-tattoo">told his tale</a> of life on set. We even uncovered <a href="https://www.polygon.com/lord-of-the-rings/22283921/peter-jackson-movies-lotr-alternate-versions-weinstein">Peter Jackson’s original two-movie pitch</a> for the series.</p>

Well, it’s the single <em>least </em>important door in the world. In fact, it’s the reverse side of the door <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/best-mario-games-galaxy-world-64-sunshine-kart-odyssey-1851325267&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/best-mario-games-galaxy-world-64-sunshine-kart-odyssey-1851325267">Mario</a></span> exits after getting the star at the end of the slide section of the level. That’s right, we’ve actually all <em>been</em> on the other side of the door and know damn well what it’s hiding—it’s just we haven’t been able to get back in.</p><p>Once you exit the door, you’re dropped right back into the main section of the level, next to the mother penguin who insists you find her kid and bring them back to her. The problem is the outside of the door doesn’t have a knob, and doesn’t allow you back through. Though I remember trying to go back through the door and failing as a kid, I didn’t realize that some folks hadn’t just <em>moved on</em> from it. Now, pannenkoek2012 has cracked this decades-long quest wide open thanks to some light platforming and knowledge of <em>Super Mario 64</em>’s coding logic.</p><p>According to their video, the biggest impediment to opening the door from the outside is the fact that the cabin walls around the entrance have collision that literally blocks the way to it. If you’ve ever tried to open the door yourself, you’ll know that Mario just kind of winds up shimmying against an invisible wall in front of the door. However, by hacking the game and removing the walls, pannenkoek2012 discovered that simply walking up to the door <em>would</em> open it, which led them to consider if it might be possible to open without hacks.<br></p><p>It turns out that by manipulating the game’s logic, you absolutely can open the door. The door’s hitbox (and this is true of every door in the game) requires that Mario be walking into the door in order to open it. Since the cabin walls’ collision barred Mario from interacting with the hitbox, it’s physically impossible to accomplish by normal means. But by manipulating the AI of the mother penguin (whose hitbox pushes Mario outwards) it’s possible to just barely clip Mario into the door enough to have him open it. Though players have found that jumping over the mother penguin into the door would send Mario free falling through the level’s geometry, someone who goes by the Discord username Alexpalix1 discovered that by turning around immediately after the free fall (which sets Mario’s condition to walking), you would miraculously be able to collide with the door’s hitbox and open it from the outside.</p><p>Naturally, pannenkoek2012 tried to apply this newfound exploit to <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/awesome-games-done-quick-2024-agdq-shiba-inu-1850939684&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/awesome-games-done-quick-2024-agdq-shiba-inu-1850939684">speedrunning</a></span> and see if it was a quicker strategy than the pre-established route. Though they found that it didn’t really save time, the discovery of the tech itself could pave the way for optimizations down the road.</p><p>Even though the door leads to a room we’re all very familiar with, and contains no secrets, it’s always neat to see <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/the-shadow-of-the-colossus-remakes-big-new-secret-is-a-1822871508&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/the-shadow-of-the-colossus-remakes-big-new-secret-is-a-1822871508">communities come together</a></span> to solve mysteries like this. <em>Super Mario 64 </em>players in particular have been trying to crack that game wide open for a long while now, and seeing the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/super-mario-64-youtube-sm64-nintendo-secret-1up-hidden-1850214597&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/super-mario-64-youtube-sm64-nintendo-secret-1up-hidden-1850214597">fruits of their labor</a></span> is always pretty incredible. You’d think that after all this time the game would run out of ways to keep surprising us, but its most diehard fans have kept it alive and entertaining for 28 years and counting. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Undisputed boxing is heading to consoles in October. Developer <a href="https://twitter.com/PlayUndisputed/status/1791136581413146733" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Steel City Interactive (SCI) has announced</a> that Undisputed will launch version 1.0 on PC, Xbox Series X|S, and PlayStation 5 (PS5) on October 11, 2024.</p>



<p>When it releases, Undisputed will be the first simulation boxing game since Fight Night Champion in 2011 to be available on console.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>The game will offer a Standard Edition as well as a Deluxe WBC Edition. Those who purchase the WBC Edition will get access to the following:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>The Fighters Pack:</strong>&nbsp;Jaime Munguia, Regis Prograis, Jesse ‘Bam’ Rodriguez, Dmitry Bivol, Caleb Plant, and Julio Cesar Chavez, along with alternative ring attire for each.</li>



<li><strong>The Apparel Pack:&nbsp;</strong>Alternative ring attire for Claressa Shields, Canelo Alvarez, Oleksandr Usyk, Katie Taylor, Tyson Fury, and Amir Khan.</li>



<li><strong>The Eras Pack:</strong>&nbsp;Three young fighter versions – Tyson Fury ’09, Canelo Alvarez ’11, and Muhammad Ali ’64.</li>
</ul>



<p>If you purchase the physical Deluxe WBC Edition you’ll also receive a WBC patch.</p>



<p>In an interview with Insider Gaming in February, SCI CEO Ash Habib talked about the game’s development and its <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/exclusive-undisputed-boxing-development-now-focused-on-console/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">focus on the console release</a> after launching the career mode in beta for those on PC.</p>



<p><strong>“We’re fully focused on our console development,” </strong>Habib said at the time. <strong>“We’re going through that process right now in terms of getting us to that version one launch on consoles.</strong> <strong>Launching the game on Steam or PC platforms is a completely different ballgame when it comes to consoles, so we’re just navigating that path at the moment.”</strong></p>



<p>In addition the game’s release on Xbox Series X|S and PS5, SCI has been <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nWCw6ZHrPPo" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reworking a number of gameplay elements</a> to add to the realistic feel of the game and how the fighters move and act within the ring.</p>



<p>Those who pre-order the game for console will get access to Roy Jones Jr. ’93.</p>

                <p>Apple recently changed <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/apples-new-rules-mean-theres-a-game-emulator-on-the-app-store-now/1100-6522747/">App Store guidelines</a> to allow retro-gaming emulators to be downloaded on iOS, and that's led to a flood of such apps on the storefront. Now, the popular PSP emulator PPSSPP is sizzling the sales charts, as is the multi-system RetroArch.</p><p dir="ltr">RetroArch is one of the biggest names in the world of emulation, as it's essentially a front-end for dozens of emulator "cores" that support a wide variety of consoles, from the Atari on down. However, it's PPSSPP that's really garnered a lot of attention on the App Store, as it currently sits at #3 on the most-downloaded <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/charts/iphone/top-free-apps/36" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">free app charts</a>. RetroArch is sitting comfortably at #16.</p><p dir="ltr">Several emulators (such as Delta) have been available on iOS through unofficial means for years, using workarounds and "sideloaded" apps through alternatives like the AltStore. However, it's worth noting that Apple's guidelines still prevent developers from providing (pirated) copies of the games that these emulators are designed to play, and the long-term future of emulators on the App Store has yet to be determined.</p><p dir="ltr">Apple changed its rules in response to the EU's recent Digital Markets Act, which expressly prohibits the "walled garden" approach that the tech giant has applied to the App Store for decades. Though these rules were motivated by this EU-only law, the regulations apply to developers worldwide.</p>

                <p>Microsoft is reportedly pushing to have no "red line" or restrictions when it comes to putting Xbox games onto PlayStation.</p><p>According <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/microsoft/microsofts-quest-for-short-term-dollardollardollar-is-doing-long-term-damage-to-windows-surface-xbox-and-beyond" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Windows Central,</a> Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella and CFO Amy Hood are mandating increasing margins across all departments. While franchises like Minecraft and Call of Duty have always been on multiple platforms even after Microsoft purchased their developers, now the conversation is reportedly involving putting even more games on rival platforms like PlayStation.</p><p>Reportedly, there's an internal plan within Microsoft codenamed "Latitude," which is focused on moving Xbox games onto other platforms, and there are already more Microsoft games that will be coming over to PlayStation.</p><p>However, it seems like there's some debate and discussion surrounding the initiative as to whether it's a good idea. If Microsoft puts more of its games onto more platforms, that would potentially decrease the reasons to even purchase an Xbox console.</p><p>Earlier this year, Microsoft <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-confirms-four-first-party-games-are-coming-to-playstation-and-nintendo-switch/1100-6521128/" data-ref-id="1100-6521128">revealed that it'd be porting</a> Sea of Thieves, Pentiment, Grounded, and Hi-Fi Rush to other platforms.

The book was published in April 2024 by Amherst College Press and is available for open-access download or paperback purchase.</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In her classic work on human-computer interaction,&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Computers as Theatre</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, game designer Brenda Laurel (</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.fulcrum.org/epubs/sf268776w/OEBPS/xhtml/ch15.xhtml#r198">2013</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">) posits that computer games and software programs are not whole systems on their own—they are partial, complete only when they are in use, with the human user essential to completing the system. Alexander R. Galloway (</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.fulcrum.org/epubs/sf268776w/OEBPS/xhtml/ch15.xhtml#r150">2006</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">) further suggests that games exist primarily as potential:</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>video games are actions</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">&nbsp;[…] Without action, games remain only in the pages of an abstract rule book. Without the active participation of players and machines, video games exist only as static computer code. Video games come into being when the machine is powered up and the software is executed; they exist when enacted.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">(Galloway&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.fulcrum.org/epubs/sf268776w/OEBPS/xhtml/ch15.xhtml#r150">2006</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, 2, emphasis in original)</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Drawing on both Laurel and Galloway, we argue that&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Ultima</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">&nbsp;titles rely heavily on players for their very existence as games. Games, but especially those which depend on players to craft personalized characters who make moral choices and evolve as imagined people, require players to put them into motion. The attract mode on an arcade screen, for example, is not a game but an invitation.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As the&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Ultima</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">&nbsp;franchise expanded in scope and complexity, with its geographic and narrative worlds becoming larger and more open-ended, the games increasingly depended on players to make them function. Structurally,&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Ultima</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">&nbsp;titles invite players to think of their in-game experiences as unique and personal, encouraging their investment and sense of ownership. This intimate player-game relationship is integral to understanding the long-standing appeal of the franchise. Personal investment encourages players to create&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Ultima</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">&nbsp;artifacts, stories, and experiences inside and beyond the boundaries of the games; it inspires and sustains fan-driven efforts to preserve and archive the titles; it catalyzes original works made in homage; and it encourages a sense of community as evidenced by the thousands of people who still, today, connect over the games on discussion boards, websites, and social media. These practices are essential to understanding the impact, legacy, and importance of the franchise and help explain why the games continue to enjoy cultural cachet rather than&nbsp; being merely historically interesting. They raise provocative questions about the intersection between forms of authorship, notions of personal and shared ownership, and the power of player communities to sustain a fantasy universe long after it has ceased to be an attractive commercial property.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">While a strong sense of ownership can be a double-edged sword—inspiring players’ loyalty&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>and</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">&nbsp;fostering their desire for meaningful control—it is central to the long-standing success of the series. Devoted players and fans occupy a distinct role in the&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Ultima</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">&nbsp;universe by documenting, extending, and analyzing the games with an incredible attention to detail. Game studies scholars Melanie Swalwell, Helen Stuckey, and Angela Ndalianis (</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.fulcrum.org/epubs/sf268776w/OEBPS/xhtml/ch15.xhtml#r274">2017</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">) argue that the work of game fans can be considered in a variety of ways: “It is time to recognize the impact and centrality of video game fan communities—as a collective intelligence, as a pool of individual creators of games and as interested and engaged parties in the collecting and remembering of game history” (1).</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In the case of the first&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Ultima</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, original copies of physical game media and packaging are rare, and finding functional solutions for playing the earliest releases on discontinued media formats like the 1980s floppy disk can range from challenging to impossible. The popularity of the&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Ultima</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">&nbsp;series has resulted in a number of reissues and remastered versions, but remakes usually lack the physical artifacts and packaging in ways that substantially alter the original play experience. Fan preservation efforts help maintain evidence of these materials. Both preservation (including emulation projects) and documentation efforts illustrate fans’ collective sense of ownership and the cultivation and sharing of player expertise. They also make clear the centrality of community to many games, including single-player titles. If games without players are incomplete, then player communities are indispensable for maintaining and recreating those primary and supporting materials necessary for accessing what the game might have looked and felt like on its initial release. Further, as Anastasia Marie Salter (</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.fulcrum.org/epubs/sf268776w/OEBPS/xhtml/ch15.xhtml#r255">2009</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">) suggests, the locus of game authorship can actually change over time. Writing about classic adventure games, they note: “Authorship of these games has changed hands: it is now under the control of the fans, the former and current players” (0.1). To some degree, this is true of&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Ultima</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">&nbsp;as well.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Organizations like the Ultima Dragons Internet Chapter (UDIC) and websites and repositories like the Ultima Codex represent game emulation and preservation efforts that breathe life into aging franchises. Some of these initiatives are extremely long running. For example, UDIC was initially founded in 1992 on the online service Prodigy and remains active more than three decades later. The Ultima Codex positions itself as a fan network, offering a rich collection of news items and documentation&nbsp;related to everything&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Ultima</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, including an&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Ultima</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">-focused podcast and a vast wiki cataloging all of the&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Ultima</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">&nbsp;titles in great detail. A separate wiki hosted at Fandom.com boasts of 2,994 articles related to the series (Ultima Wiki&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.fulcrum.org/epubs/sf268776w/OEBPS/xhtml/ch15.xhtml#r297">n.d.</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">). More general repositories of video game knowledge also demonstrate the devotion of fans. The Museum of Computer Game Adventure History, launched in 2001 by Howard Feldman, currently has scans of 49 different editions of&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Ultima</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">&nbsp;games. While this website is substantial, it still isn’t as exhaustive as Stephen Emond’s&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Ultima:</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The Ultimate Collector’s Edition</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">&nbsp;(</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.fulcrum.org/epubs/sf268776w/OEBPS/xhtml/ch15.xhtml#r139">2012</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">). This tome spans 826 pages, covering 520 different releases of&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Ultima</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">&nbsp;games and cataloging a total of 955 distinct items, which is unique in its inventory of international editions of the games.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As a genre, RPGs across media invite player engagement in distinct ways. This sense of immersion through player-customized characters in an expansive world complete with its own culture, history, and reality has proven to have exceptional stickiness for those who continue playing and replaying the games for years or even decades. In the case of&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, this long-term engagement has kept this analog tabletop title—and its many iterations across media—commercially viable for decades. Its current publishers regularly update it, and the game supports an entire microindustry. But in the case of computer games, this longer engagement represents a complicated commitment. Changes in technology can result in games quickly becoming inaccessible. For instance, publishers stop supporting servers needed for online play once a title has faded in popularity or when it becomes financially problematic. Or supplementary paratexts that complete games may be lost or damaged with the passage of time. These types of challenges are understandable at a production level. Maintaining servers and support staff can be expensive, as can the fabrication of physical goods. Even during its initial release, the metal feelies of the&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Ultima</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">&nbsp;universe were borderline cost prohibitive. Decades later, these titles have become of more niche interest and, as game distribution has increasingly moved towards digital channels, reproducing the feelies would increase production and distribution costs considerably.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">However, these games are incomplete without their paratexts, just as they are incomplete without their players. Preservation and documentation efforts that make, at the very least, information about the games’ paratexts available serve a critical role in keeping the games playable and at least passably complete. These projects, carried out through online efforts like the Ultima Codex or the High-Resolution Ultima Map Project (HRUMP) offer a corrective to the type of digitally driven reissues that make up the bread and butter of digital game distribution businesses like Good Old Games (GOG.com). There, games are ported to modern machines and stripped of their initial, physical context—we get the game, but are typically denied the out-of-box accessories and multimodal thresholds. While many editions include digital versions of physical artifacts, these function differently than their physical counterparts. This is what the market can support, perhaps, but it is neither an accurate representation of what the game was, nor is it likely what fans would prefer under ideal circumstances.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Sites like the Museum of Computer Game Adventure History carefully catalog the packaging and other paratexts of numerous games in an act of fan-driven documentation that serves as a corrective to the games’ digital decontextualization. Ironically, these otherwise orderly sites also embrace a certain unruliness when it comes to corporate control of commercial products that are formational for communities. They exist as sometimes radical remedies, providing through informal channels something the market will no longer bear. Emulation and reproduction efforts bring this tension into sharper relief. That is, while Electronic Arts&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>de jure</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">&nbsp;owns&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Ultima</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">&nbsp;outright, its de facto ownership is much muddier. These types of volunteer efforts are driven by connection, by love—for the games, for the community, for the medium, and for the present and past of all three. If games are only completed with player participation, older games are most completely realized in their fan-preserved incarnations, in collective memory, and in ongoing play; or, in what game historian Raiford Guins (</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.fulcrum.org/epubs/sf268776w/OEBPS/xhtml/ch15.xhtml#r166">2014</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">) terms, their “afterlife.”</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Here Be Ultima Dragons">Here Be Ultima Dragons</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Members of the Ultima Dragons Internet Chapter (UDIC) are at the forefront of these efforts. If someone is involved in anything&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Ultima</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">-related, and if they’re using an online name with “Dragon” in it, they’re almost certainly a UDIC member. The fan group today boasts nearly 16,000 members on its official website roster, where members are individually listed by their Dragon name, human name, and their UDIC email address. UDIC also lists a similar number of members on its public Facebook group, where members discuss&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Ultima</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">-related projects of their own, ask for help accessing or playing the games, and share a diversity of content ranging from RPG-related memes to science reporting, to Halloween decorating tips (“Ultima Dragons&nbsp;Page 144 →Internet Chapter Facebook”&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.fulcrum.org/epubs/sf268776w/OEBPS/xhtml/ch15.xhtml#r296">n.d.</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">). Dragons talk shop about gameplay, share obscure lore, celebrate&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Ultima</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">-related news, make their own series-inspired projects, and meticulously document anything that may be remotely related to&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Ultima</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Their efforts are central to&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Ultima</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">’s afterlife. At the UDIC website, membership is open to those who “have played an&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Ultima</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, are willing to help others with their&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Ultima</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">&nbsp;questions, and would like to be a member of the Ultima Dragons.” Prospective members can join via email or by a short questionnaire that asks for some biographical information, which&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Ultima</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">&nbsp;titles the applicant has played and/or completed, and what their Dragon name should be (“UDIC – Ultima Dragons Internet Chapter”&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.fulcrum.org/epubs/sf268776w/OEBPS/xhtml/ch15.xhtml#r290">n.d.</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">). On the last point, the site offers this tip: “Don’t pick something that’s been in an&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Ultima</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">; pick something that ought to be. ‘Dragon’ will be automatically appended. You may want to check the master roster of current members before choosing a dragon name.” A last requirement is made explicit elsewhere on the site: prospective members must provide a “real name.” The transparency about membership—the membership roster is public on both the Facebook group and the UDIC website—and the visibility of real names are indicative of the age of the community (as is the site’s late-1990s design aesthetics that, once generic,&nbsp;now convey a distinctive visual style). In fact, providing a real name and having played an&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Ultima</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">&nbsp;game are the only two requirements for joining, and Fallible Dragon offers the following explanation for the name policy:</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">First, where it asks for real name, you have to type in your real name. If you’re really concerned, you can use your first initial and your last name. But it has to be your real name. The whole thing. “John” alone won’t cut it. We want to see “John Doe” or “J. Doe”.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This is a question of honesty and respect. You being honest with the rest of the club and respecting us, and the rest of the club respecting you in return. How can we respect you if you don’t feel we’re worthy of knowing your name? If you really don’t want to give out your real name, then you’re welcome to lurk and participate in the activities, but please don’t waste your time by filling out an application.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">(“Dragon Requirements”&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.fulcrum.org/epubs/sf268776w/OEBPS/xhtml/ch15.xhtml#r134">n.d.</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">)</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Research on the implications of real-name policies suggests that they can reduce antisocial behaviors at the aggregate level, shaping community norms and discourse (Cho, Kim, and Acquisti&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.fulcrum.org/epubs/sf268776w/OEBPS/xhtml/ch15.xhtml#r118">2012</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">). This policy is, effectively, a community management practice that shapes the UDIC, and the UDIC, as an exceptionally visible group, shapes the collective experience of&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Ultima</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. Further, the mixing of real names and dragon names interpellates community members through the types of naming practices that exist throughout the&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Ultima</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">&nbsp;universe. Here, you are a person who exists in the real world and as a character all at once. The language of the name policy is reflective of the kinds of values integrated across the series. Honesty, respect, and worth may sound like a heavy burden for an internet community made up of members with names like Rainbow Dragon to bear, but this dual emphasis on personal values&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>and</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">&nbsp;a sense of play are central to the series and its community.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Devotees of&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Ultima</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, like the members of UDIC, cannot help but engage with questions of values because those questions are central to the series. The players understand community behaviors and norms as a matter of values, and they directly and indirectly point towards the games as moral texts. In preserving the games and shaping a community, UDIC exhibits a central concern with integrity—of member behavior and of the game world, which is viewed as something to be preserved and supplemented with careful fidelity. This investment in the&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Ultima</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">&nbsp;franchise can reflect a certain degree of reverence, but it also invites a sense of ownership. After all, many UDIC members are experts on the games, and a fundamental function of the group is to grow and to share that expertise. This use of expertise goes far beyond playing with the games as once published and extends into efforts aimed at preservation and immersion.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In many real ways,&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Ultima</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">&nbsp;fans are the series’ historians and its guardians. Indeed, because the games’ original developers no longer have the intellectual property rights to the brand and lack the liberties available to fans as producers of transformative works, fans protect the series’ legacy to a greater extent than the original producers.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Authorship and Ownership">Authorship and Ownership</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Fan-driven projects can raise the visibility and usability of historic games, such as those preserved through multiple arcade machine emulation (MAME). While original&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Ultima</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">&nbsp;paratexts and ephemera may be difficult to locate today, fan projects provide and expand on information that can substitute for these missing materials. They can also provide insights into the aspects of the games players find particularly compelling. For example, fan-made tourism brochures reveal a loving devotion to the games’ cultural and geographic landscapes. But more importantly, these practices demonstrate the degree to which&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Ultima</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">&nbsp;is for many players a fully-rendered world. In both drawing from and extending the series’ narrative universe, fan works participate in metalepsis, a narrative practice articulated by French literary theorist Gerard Genette (</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.fulcrum.org/epubs/sf268776w/OEBPS/xhtml/ch15.xhtml#r156">1980</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, 234–236). Tisha Turk (</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.fulcrum.org/epubs/sf268776w/OEBPS/xhtml/ch15.xhtml#r287">2011</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">), who studies fan videos, describes how these projects engage in metalepsis: “These fan works are both texts in their own right and supplements (in the Derridean sense) to the original source material: fan works supplement texts that are already complete, but always with the shadow meaning, the possibility, of adding&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>in order to</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">&nbsp;complete” (83–84).&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Ultima</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">&nbsp;fan works both assume that Sosaria and Britannia are real worlds&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>and</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">&nbsp;that they can supplement what is available in the official canon—a process that they first initiate through character-creation. Later, as they become well-versed in the games, players sometimes invest time in producing supplements and utilities they would find useful or those they think will make the games more accessible by expanding the series’ spaces and stories. Yes—fans document&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Ultima</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">&nbsp;but they also iterate on it. Fan works can preserve and conserve the original, world-building efforts. Furthermore, they can also correct, complicate, adapt, and expand those realms. These practices build worlds upon worlds, offering experiences that are anchored in but are nevertheless distinct from the original titles.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Conclusion: Whose Game World Is It?">Conclusion: Whose Game World Is It?</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Many of the expansion, documentation, and preservation efforts of&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Ultima</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">&nbsp;players fall into an awkward status with regards to copyright. These projects are overwhelmingly small-scale and are noncommercial in nature. And while some creators are hit with cease-and-desist letters, most produce works that extend the broader&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Ultima</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">&nbsp;world without incurring the ire of lawyers. Writing about fan practices around adventure games, Salter notes that copyright does not always curtail fan creation because fans either ignore it or because the projects are deemed to be transformative works. In reproducing or expanding the games, fans become creators in their own right. Salter (</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.fulcrum.org/epubs/sf268776w/OEBPS/xhtml/ch15.xhtml#r255">2009</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">) notes:</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Fan creators of the classic adventure game movement can also be identified as cocreators, as they are in dialogue with the work of the original developers[…]. Fan authorship co-opts material from the existing games without requiring the game itself. A game authored by a fan stands on its own and is playable as a complete structure. It is informed by the original, and may even be an exacting remake of the original, but it is developed separately.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Players, then, pursue diverse activities that preserve and document games. They also engage in metaleptical practices that extend and&nbsp;conceivably complete the games as well. Through these activities, fans claim ownership of the game world, either directly (as in reproductions or extensions of the&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Ultima</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">&nbsp;franchise) or indirectly (through documentation and preservation). They build on the customization and personalization of game experiences, moving from sanctioned to unsanctioned types of engagement and remaking CRPGs and their game worlds.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Like all digital and analog games, the&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Ultima</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">&nbsp;series present partial gaming texts—systems that are incomplete without players and their gameplay practices. Even when these games were new, players created resources for one another. And as the games have aged, fans increasingly claim ownership and actively participate in various acts of authorship. Without fans extending the game experience,&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Ultima</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">&nbsp;would largely be mothballed. Instead, their robust activities keep the games circulating in popular culture.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Ultima</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">&nbsp;titles demonstrate how vital community can be for a game series. The fan community that grew up with the series provided dependable commercial support when the games were first released. But its community has, over time, evolved to become central to others’&nbsp;experiences of the franchise. Fans like those who join UDIC play&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Ultima</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, but—as importantly—they also&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>play with</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">&nbsp;it, expanding its world with works of their own, experimenting with what the narrative limits of that world might be, and mentoring others in the skills and the knowledge needed to participate in the community. Richard Garriott and Origin Systems built the first generation of&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Ultima</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">&nbsp;worlds, but the series endures and maintains its landmark status because fans have stepped into the creative void as its collective of world-builders and world-preservers.</span></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The studio is based in Warsaw, Poland, and, according to a report from&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/activision-opens-new-studio-tasked-with-creating-narrative-based-aaa-franchise"><em>IGN</em></a>, it is not working on a Call of Duty-related project.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This studio, which has been formed behind-the-scenes before today's public unveiling, arrives roughly one week after <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/news/2024/05/07/xbox-is-shutting-down-arkane-austin-tango-gameworks-and-more">Xbox closed four Bethesda studios</a>, including <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/review/hi-fi-rush/riff-city">Hi-Fi Rush</a> developer Tango Gameworks and <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/review/redfall/a-life-draining-trip-to-new-england">Redfall</a> team Arkane Austin. While the company has yet to publicly address the closures directly, Xbox president Sarah Bond said in an interview that <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/news/2024/05/10/xbox-president-addresses-bethesda-studio-closures-says-its-about-keeping-business">the closures were about keeping the business healthy in the long-term</a>. It's why news of this new studio might be surprising, given one week ago, the parent company of Activision was closing studios to cut costs.&nbsp;</p>

"The team's underlying mission encourages everyone to explore and collaborate creatively to craft a franchise with an enduring legacy that resonates far beyond games. [The] new studio has full access to Activision's resources and tools as it continues to increase production and development.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Elsewhere is opening its search for best-in-class talent from across the industry and around the world to help create a state-of-the-art and next generation gaming experience."&nbsp;</p>

<p>Elsewhere is currently made up of developers with experience working on franchises like The Last of Us, Uncharted, The Witcher, Cyberpunk 2077, Destiny, Tom Clancy's The Division, and Far Cry.&nbsp;</p>

<p data-characters="232" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Remember the rumours of 2017’s <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-horizon-zero-dawn/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Horizon Zero Dawn</a></em> getting <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/horizon-zero-dawn-remaster-remake-ps5-rumor-sie-guerrilla-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a PlayStation 5 remaster</a>? No such project has been formally confirmed, but the newest <em>Horizon</em> related rumour says we’re instead getting some kind of Lego spin-off.</p> <p data-characters="549" data-current-count="549" data-injectable="true">A trademark for something called <em>Lego Horizon Adventures</em> was recently discovered by <a href="https://twitter.com/Kurakasis/status/1791073620069929442" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Twitter user Kurakasis</a>, the same person who <a href="https://twitter.com/Kurakasis/status/1745225191762870283" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">uncovered the title of Microsoft’s <em>Indiana Jones</em> game</a> before its official reveal. Shortly afterwards, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/lego-horizon-adventures/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Insider Gaming’s Tom Henderson</a> claimed to have heard from his own sources that this is referring to what was only described as “<em>Horizon Forbidden West</em> but Lego.” The only other detail Henderson added was that the game will have “realistic graphics,” which is strange for a Lego game.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><div> <blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>LEGO Horizon Adventures</p><p>This is the name of the project that is going to be announced at the upcoming PlayStation event</p><p>I don't know if it's a game</p></div>— Kurakasis (@Kurakasis) <a href="https://twitter.com/Kurakasis/status/1791073620069929442?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 16, 2024</a></blockquote> </div></figure> <p data-characters="524" data-current-count="824" data-injectable="true">As bizarre as the concept may sound, Sony and Lego did collaborate on an official Lego set based on the <em>Horizon</em> series. Plus, not too long ago, Lego entered a big partnership with Epic Games for <em>Lego Fortnite</em>, which suggests the Lego company is still looking to expand for new ways to expand into gaming. Henderson hasn’t mentioned, though, whether <em>Lego Horizon Adventures</em> would recreate the original <em>Forbidden West</em>‘s gameplay or be more in line with previous Lego titles like <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-lego-star-wars-the-skywalker-saga/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Lego Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga</a></em>.</p>
 <p data-characters="460" data-current-count="460" data-injectable="true">Assuming such a project exists, it could potentially make an appearance at the similarly rumoured PlayStation showcase that’s supposedly happening soon. It’s been suggested one will take place before the end of May, and it’s not unreasonable to assume that’s the case. Sony held a big gaming showcase in May 2023 as well, and we are coming up to what was once E3 season; the time of year where publishers share big gaming announcements.</p>
 <p data-characters="436" data-current-count="436" data-injectable="false">Sony’s first-party output is also looking incredibly slim. Aside from live service title <em>Concord</em> (which is aiming for a 2024 launch), Sony has no other first-party exclusives on its release schedule, with the likes of Insomniac’s <em>Wolverine</em> game and Bungie’s <em>Marathon</em> reboot lacking any sort of launch window. <em>Lego Horizon Adventures</em> would at least be something, though probably not what most PS5 owners are asking for.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/activision-elsewhere-entertainment<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Activision has announced a brand new studio called Elsewhere Entertainment. Based in Poland, the studio consists of industry vets who've worked on games like <i>The Last of Us</i>&nbsp;and <i>The Witcher</i>.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://blog.activision.com/activision/2024/activision-announces-new-studio-elsewhere-entertainment-all-new-franchise-development" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a blog post on its official website</a>, Activision says that Elsewhere, which is an internal development studio, is currently hard at work on "a new narrative-based and genre-defining AAA franchise".</p>
<p>The company also says Elsewhere's new franchise will create "an enduring legacy that resonates far beyond games", potentially suggesting that multimedia projects based on said franchise could also be in the works.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/far-cry-5-activision-elsewhere.jpg?itok=ijLIhz_i 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/far-cry-5-activision-elsewhere.jpg?itok=cnZ0CTxp 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Elsewhere Entertainment consists of veterans from franchises like&nbsp;<em>Far Cry</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>According to Activision, Elsewhere's staffers have worked on franchises like "<em>The Last of Us</em>,&nbsp;<em>Uncharted</em>,&nbsp;<em>The Witcher</em>,&nbsp;<em>Cyberpunk</em>,&nbsp;<em>Destiny</em>,&nbsp;<em>Tom Clancy's The Division</em>, and&nbsp;<em>Far Cry</em>".</p>
<p>Since the announcement is relatively brief, it's not clear exactly which staffers Elsewhere has on board from those franchises, nor do we know how they're contributing to the studio's inaugural project.</p>
<p>However, we do know that Elsewhere will have "full access to Activision's resources" as it "continues to increase production and development", and that the studio is "opening its search for best-in-class talent".</p>
<p>Obviously, Elsewhere's debut game isn't ready to reveal yet, but we may well learn more about it in the coming months.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-last-of-us-part-i-elsewhere-activision.jpg?itok=rhQIQAWZ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-last-of-us-part-i-elsewhere-activision.jpg?itok=UI1geM7w 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>The Last of Us&nbsp;</em>is just one of the all-star franchises that staffers from Activision's new studio Elsewhere have apparently been involved in.</figcaption></figure><p>Elsewhere's formation comes as Activision's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/microsoft-activision-blizzard-merger-finalized">parent company</a> Microsoft finds itself under the microscope for what many consider to be its questionable recent decisions.</p>
<p>Recently, Microsoft <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/microsoft-arkane-austin-tango-gameworks-shutdown">shut down</a>&nbsp;<em>Redfall&nbsp;</em>creator Arkane Austin and&nbsp;<em>Hi-Fi Rush&nbsp;</em>studio Tango Gameworks, as well as two other studios, shortly before declaring that the Xbox brand <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xbox-smaller-games-comment-hi-fi-rush">needed "smaller games"</a> to garner prestige and awards.</p>
<p>Those decisions were made following a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/microsoft-xbox-layoffs-report">round of layoffs</a> that saw Microsoft letting go of almost 2,000 employees. There's probably a lot of number-crunching we're not seeing behind the scenes, but Activision opening a new studio in the wake of all of that seems...interesting.</p>
<p>We'll have to wait and see what Elsewhere Entertainment comes up with for its first game. Stay tuned for more.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/your-apple-tv-may-have-become-one-of-the-best-retro-gaming-devices-out-there-overnight.873003/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24158137/apple-tv-video-game-emulators-retroarch<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="lDsq6f">The RetroArch video game emulation frontend was <a href="https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/retroarch/id6499539433">released on the iOS App Store</a> yesterday, alongside popular <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/ppsspp-psp-emulator/id6496972903">PSP emulator PPSSPP</a> (itself a core available in RetroArch). </p>
<p id="ed09Ik">While the popular and more elegant Delta emulator emulates six Nintendo consoles for iOS at the moment, RetroArch’s somewhat unwieldy UI brings support for a wild 78 (!) emulators covering a wide range of console and computer systems. But it also brings one other notable feature: It’s the first emulator to be released for Apple’s tvOS App Store, as spotted by <a href="https://www.threads.net/@sigjudge/post/C7AYptfofLI">MacStories’ Sigmund Judge</a>. </p>
<p id="E6A5pC">And that’s all because of a historic change in policy from Apple. In March, the company released an iOS update that included concessions to comply with the European Union’s Digital Markets Act (DMA), which forced the tech giant to open its platform to alternative app marketplaces in Europe. Of course, one reason a user might travel outside of Apple’s walled garden would be to acquire a video game emulator, and Apple changed a long-standing policy to allow video game emulators a month later, in an effort to head off that eventuality.</p>

<p id="qdtXOL">Before RetroArch’s release, it was technically possible to use game emulators on Apple TV via AirPlay, effectively casting Delta to the Apple TV. But native support means no casting latency, and the ability to use an actual gamepad instead of your phone’s slippery glass screen. With RetroArch, you’ll be able to play games from classic Sega systems like the Master System, Genesis and Saturn, as well as more obscure consoles like the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Watara_Supervision">Watara Supervision</a>. </p>

<p id="bxJFaC">As access to video game emulators becomes simpler, and the hardware more capable of providing a high quality experience — like playing Sega Genesis games on an Apple TV for example — the emulation community, and the platforms that they are being distributed on, are creating a moment similar to that of the iPod in the early aughts. The technology existed to play MP3 files, but it wasn’t until the iPod’s release that it became truly mainstream. And once playing MP3s was easy, the question of where you got all those MP3s from in the first place changed music distribution forever, first with the iTunes Store and later streaming services like Spotify. </p>
<p id="6tum7z">You can find <a href="https://apps.apple.com/gb/app/retroarch/id6499539433">RetroArch</a>, <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/delta-game-emulator/id1048524688">Delta</a>, and <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/ppsspp-psp-emulator/id6496972903">PPSSPP</a> on the App Store today. And if you’re so inclined, let us know in the comments if you’re interested in using your Apple TV for retro games.

The PlayStation Store leak that occured last week revealed not only the Deluxe Edition cover, but <a href="https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/6640db93966b70e6c5c909d3/EACF25/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&amp;crop=1655,932,x0,y19,safe&amp;width=1440" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a screenshot of gameplay</a> featuring players from the Notre Dame Fighting Irish football team exiting the tunnel and heading onto the field. </p><p>In February, EA dropped <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ea-sports-college-football-25-full-reveal-coming-this-may">an official teaser trailer</a> showing development concepts, such as players from the Notre Dame Fighting Irish football team tapping the "Play Like a Champion Today" sign before heading into the tunnel. </p><p>Following the teaser announcement in early February, EA Sports revealed to <a href="https://www.espn.com/college-football/story/_/id/39574788/players-opting-ea-sports-college-football-25-get-600" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ESPN</a> some <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ea-sports-college-football-25-player-compensation-revealed">new details for College Football 25</a>. This includes confirmation that all 134 FBS football programs will be included, how much players who opt-in will be paid for using their likeness in the game, while those who do not opt-in will not be allowed to create themselves as a playable character, as well as reaffirming that Dynasty and Road to Glory game modes will return.</p><h2><strong>The long road to make the next College Football video game</strong></h2><p>EA officially announced it was <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ea-sports-college-football-is-returning-for-the-first-time-since-2013">making another college football game in 2021</a> when it originally planned not to use any real names or likenesses of the student-athletes. When <a href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/20pdf/20-512_gfbh.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the Supreme Court ruled</a> that student-athletes could profit from using their name, image, and likeness (NIL), EA announced it <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ea-ncaa-football-players-comments">would add real college football players</a> into its upcoming game. </p><p>Similar legal challenges surfaced for EA in its recent venture into college football video games. Initially canceled due to legal issues, the series encountered similar obstacles when The BrandR Group, a licensing agency for student-athletes, <a href="https://law.justia.com/cases/federal/district-courts/california/candce/4:2023cv02994/414223/23/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">filed a lawsuit against EA</a>, arguing that compensation for participating student-athletes was "significantly below market value." EA <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ea-sports-college-football-still-on-track-for-summer-2024-release-following-lawsuit-settlement">eventually settled the lawsuit</a>.</p><p>College Football 25's Standard and Deluxe Editions are available to pre-order now, but EA said it is offering a third version called the EA Sports MVP Bundle, which includes one copy each of the Deluxe Editions of both College Football 25 and Madden NFL 25, both of which will move the release date up by three days for each game, allowing you to play sooner.</p><p><em>Taylor is a Reporter at IGN.

It is currently recruiting developers in hopes of creating a "state-of-the-art and next-generation gaming experience," which IGN understands is not a Call of Duty-related project.</p><p>Little else is known about Elsewhere Entertainment's first franchise, though the post does mention that the studio hopes to "craft a franchise with an enduring legacy that resonates far beyond games." That would seem to point to a transmedia franchise that will try to replicate the success of <a href="https://www.ign.com/tv/the-last-of-us-the-series">The Last of Us</a> and <a href="https://www.ign.com/tv/fallout-the-series">Fallout</a>, or maybe just <a href="https://www.ign.com/tech/super-nintendo-world">get its own theme park</a>.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>To this point, Activision has mostly been known for its work on the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-2024-file-hinting-at-possible-may-reveal-discovered-in-modern-warfare-3-update">Call of Duty series</a>, with Crash Bandicoot developer Toys for Bob opting to go independent following the Xbox acquisition. In addition to the Crash Bandicoot games, Activision Publishing has also released <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/03/21/sekiro-shadows-die-twice-review">Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice</a> and <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2014/09/03/destiny-review">Destiny</a>. </p><p>Elsewhere Entertainment's opening stands out in an industry that has lately been rocked by layoffs. Last week, Activision Blizzard parent company Microsoft closed multiple studios including <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/shock-and-anger-as-xbox-shuts-down-arkane-austin-tango-gameworks-and-more">Tango Gameworks and Arkane Austin</a>. Activision Blizzard was also impacted by layoffs in the early part of 2024, with Blizzard being particularly affected.</p><p>It's unclear when Elsewhere Entertainment's game will be released, though based on existing development timelines it's likely to be a few years yet. In the meantime, Activision appears to be preparing to reveal the next Call of Duty at <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-games-showcase-announced-for-june">next month's Xbox Showcase</a>, which is set for June 9.</p><p><em>Kat Bailey is IGN's News Director as well as co-host of Nintendo Voice Chat.
