<figure><a title="Silksong Cute" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/6a449938508fd/silksong-cute.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Over a week after beating <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hollow-knight-silksong-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a>, I’ve decided that we’re all focusing on the wrong things. Hornet’s fast-paced movement and range of options are breathtaking, sure, and the game can be maddening. But instead of succumbing to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/team-cherry-explains-hollow-knight-silksongs-steep-difficulty">the difficulty discourse</a>, instead of falling into a pit of spikes for a 13th time after a pogo-platforming section, let’s all take a deep breath and give in to the truth about Silksong.</p>
<p>This game is so gosh-darned <em>cute</em>.</p>
<p>Now, cute isn’t exactly alien to Team Cherry; The Knight in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/hollow_knight">Hollow Knight</a> is adorable, a little guy in a big ol’ world, mute with big eyes and small proportions. The Grubs and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eGPI76PVjnw">their babbles</a> entice you to rescue each and every one of them. And don’t tell me you’ve resisted the fuzziness of the <a href="https://hollowknight.wiki/w/Tiktik">Tiktiks</a> or <a href="https://hollowknight.fandom.com/wiki/Hiveling">Hivelings</a>.</p><div><figure data-videoid="8PPa7JzGiQE" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8PPa7JzGiQE?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/8PPa7JzGiQE?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8PPa7JzGiQE?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed61a957isphxy&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8PPa7JzGiQE" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>Tonal dissonance is part of the magic of both Hollow Knight and Silksong; both Hallownest and Pharloom are full of the weird and wonderful, the dark and the beautiful, the horrifying and adorable. But Silksong takes all of this to a new level, even the cuteness.</p>
<p>It took less than a day for the world to fall in love with the singing pilgrim Sherma, who happily taps his chime against his stick. It’s irresistibly catchy, and there’s no way you won’t be singing along with him by the time you unlock the door he stands in front of, hoping his cheerful tune will light the way.</p>
<figure><a title="Silksong Cute" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/63fd4cdd54d4d/silksong-cute.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Sherma reminds me of Myla from Hollow Knight, a singing miner who, despite everything, continues to do what she does best, with a spring in her step. Sherma is a little beacon of joy amidst the cruelty of Pharloom, there every step of the way, napping by benches, singing their song, and helping those in need.</p>
<p>Hornet needs a friend like that in Pharloom, because she's different from The Knight in many ways; she’s cool, she’s stoic, and she’s both elegant and direct in her speech. But, she’s also a massive goofball who floats like an umbrella with her limbs dangling and her eyes vapid and empty. Every ounce of Hornet’s demeanour evaporated when I saw this for the first time.</p>
<figure><a title="Silksong Cute" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/480c3c1cf3163/silksong-cute.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Oh, and did you know Hornet loves fluffy things? We’re so alike in that way. She never explicitly says anything about it, but as you begin to fill up the Hunter’s Journal and complete entries for each foe, Hornet’s appreciation for the softer side of life comes through.</p>
<p>Take the first bug you defeat in Pharloom, the Mossgrub. Hornet says, “If not for the spikes, I would think it an appealing bug.” I can’t disagree with you, Hornet; it’s pretty darn cute with that mossy green exterior. She’s even more complimentary about the larger version (“So close to a perfect furred form…”) and the flying ones (“This bug is soft and clumsy”).</p>
<p>The enemies around Bellhart receive similar treatment – donning bells on their backs and haunted eyes, Hornet can barely resist the temptation of these fluffy foes: “Huge and soft, a fantastic combination ruined by their haunted aggression,” she says of the Winged Furm.</p>
<figure><a title="Silksong cute" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/bc89bb52ec7ed/silksong-cute.large.jpg"></a><figcaption>These guys are cute too, but also pretty <em>annoying</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Hornet has similar feelings about Fleas, and honestly, so do I. Fleas in the real world <em>suck</em> – literally. I’ve had pet dogs before and tall grass + fluffy dogs are <em>not</em> a great combination, especially because bugs seem to enjoy the taste of...me. *shudder*</p>
<p>Silksong’s Fleas, though? Absolutely perfect. They’re part of a travelling caravan and, like the Grubs in Hollow Knight, you need to rescue them for some nice rewards. But I’m not here for the rewards; I’m here for the fuzzy little Fleas that yap and bark and howl like puppies.</p>

<p>I love the Grub noises in Hollow Knight, but I think I love the Fleas’ going <em>“awoooo!”</em> even more. Every time you free them, they flap around, eyes covered by their mounds of fluff, do a little howl and then zoom off to the caravan. They’re no less cute when gathered together, either, sometimes sleeping on the bench, other times taking a bath in the nearby lake.</p>
<p>The most delightful part of collecting the Fleas, though, comes when Mooshka, the caravan’s leader, decides to move the caravan.</p>
<p>This happens a few times throughout Silksong, but every time Mooshka asks if you want to get in the caravan, <em>do it</em>. You’ll get a little cutscene with Hornet stuffed inside the transport with a whole bunch of other Fleas. Surely she’s living in bliss amidst all the fluffiness?</p>

<p>But I’ve saved the best till last, at least in my eyes: Silksong’s equivalent of The Last Stag, the Bell Beast. I’ve affectionately named her Isabelle, because, well…. I’m sure you can tell why.</p>
<p>As the game’s first boss, the Bell Beast isn’t hard, but the reward she gives you is invaluable: Access to the game’s Bellways and a form of fast travel. Oh, and a creature that essentially becomes Hornet’s ride-or-die, her best buddy, and the equivalent of an oversized dog.</p>
<p>She naps at Bellway stations as you explore Pharloom; she growls softly when you ring the bells hanging above her. She stops her many feet when she’s eager and excited. If you play the Needolin next to her, she starts to sing next to her. Isabelle is just a giant dog in my eyes. When Team Cherry was asked to patch in the option to pet the Bell Beast, they revealed it was already in the game: <a href="https://x.com/griffinmatta/status/1964016769237909832">“Attack to pet”</a>.</p>
<figure><a title="Silksong Cute" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/f6b649f3a4c37/silksong-cute.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>And she does like it! She growls and purrs when Hornet uses the Needle on her, and presumably it’s the only way she can feel anything because her shell is so hard. This also totally recontextualises the boss battle against her – you’re not subduing the Bell Beast with violence, you’re actually petting her over and over again until she calms down.</p>
<p>I’m not even touching on late-game stuff here, because even when things are at their most dire, Silksong still has moments of adorableness, parts of the game where you can unwind and admire the craft of the world and the characters. If these delightful aspects weren’t in the game, Silksong would be pretty overwhelmingly dour. You need these moments of fun.</p>
<figure><a title="Silksong Cute" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/bfa1b252f2dee/silksong-cute.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>So I urge you, if you’re struggling against a boss, or you’re fed up with pogo-jumping across a pit of death, pay the Bell Beast a visit. Go and find some of those yapping fleas. Just run around and spend time absorbing the locations with a less oppressive atmosphere.</p>
<p>The precious characters, interactions, and animations of Silksong are far more important than the challenges put in front of you. Is there anything truly better than coming home after a crappy day at work to your pet saying hello? I don’t think so, and so, when I’m up against the wall, fighting a boss, I know that Isabelle, the Fleas, Sherma, and so many other things are waiting on the other side to brighten my day.</p>

Were there any real-life inspirations in designing the cult?</strong></p><p><strong>Kazutaka Kodaka, Creator, Planner, and Scenario Writer:</strong> “Originally, I wanted an indie game idea, tackling an edgy theme that wouldn’t be possible with a big budget, so I chose to focus on cults and dismemberment murder.</p><p>“Later, I came up with a trick that really fit that theme, but to pull it off the game’s scale ended up becoming too large, so I put it on hold for a while.</p><p>“When I got to know <a title="Companies > DMM Games [91 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/exnoa/dmm-games">DMM GAMES</a>, I showed them a plot that incorporated this idea. Despite the extreme theme, they agreed to work on it together, and that’s how this title came to life.”</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p><strong><em>SHUTEN ORDER</em>‘s religion forbids violence, yet the story revolves around murder. How did you balance that without breaking the cult’s rules?</strong></p><p><strong>Kodaka:</strong> “As a cult, they have their own unique values ​​and rules. That’s why they wish for the end of the world. Everything ties back to a single, overarching mystery, the dismemberment murder of their leader. I constructed the story and setting specifically to lead to that conclusion. <a title="Series > Persona [91 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/series/persona">Persona</a>lly, I think it’s one of my best works, so I hope you’ll see for yourself.”</p><p><strong>Each Minister’s route uses a different genre. How did you keep them feeling like one game, versus a collection of several smaller games?</strong></p><p><strong>Takumi Nakazawa, Director and Scenario Writer:</strong> “There are two key points.</p><p>“The first is to stick to the main theme. In every route, we made sure to organically weave the story into the scenario of each route, so as not to lose sight of the core of the story, which is the murder of the cult leader, and the protagonist’s goal of finding the killer.</p><p>“The second is to maintain a consistent tone. When developing the game systems for each genre, we were careful not to stray from the setting of <em>SHUTEN ORDER</em>.”</p><p><strong>When designing the Ministers, did you start with their character archetypes and then match genres to fit them, or did you first decide on the genres and build the characters around that? Can you talk a bit about that process?</strong></p><p><strong>Nakazawa:</strong> “I heard from Kodaka that both were decided on almost simultaneously, but the genre came slightly ahead. For example, it was broadly decided that one of the routes would be a mystery adventure. Since that seemed like a good place for a detective character to play an active role, we constructed the image for Kishiru Inugami around Sherlock Holmes. The scenario’s plot was then built around that idea. After that, the details of the character were solidified as the scenario was written.</p><p>“On the other hand, for the Ministry of Science route, there were times when the genre was reconsidered after the character had already been decided. It’s not like we decided completely on one element and then solidified the other.”</p><p><strong>The routes range from <a title="Genres > Horror [713 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/horror">horror</a> to romance. How did you approach creating the soundtrack so that it fits all these different genres?</strong></p><p><strong>Masafumi Takada, Composer and Sound Director:</strong> “To evoke the culture of Shuten Order, I first created several thematic motifs shared across the entire game, and then arranged them to match each route, thereby shaping the soundtrack’s sense of world.</p><p>“In other words, if the motifs are like ‘words,’ the arrangements can be seen as the ‘rhythm and harmony’ of each genre’s language.</p><p>“By doing so, the soundtrack transforms with each route, yet throughout the game the world of <em>SHUTEN ORDER</em> lingers like a scent, remaining with players as a lasting part of their experience.”</p><p><strong>The protagonist Rei only has four days to live. Why four? How did you decide on that time limit for the story? And how did that limit change your approach to pacing?</strong></p><p><strong>Kodaka:</strong> “The four-day rule is something shared across all of the routes. I decided on it by looking at the balance within each route.</p><p>“Depending on the route, it turned out to be quite a tough restriction, but I think we somehow managed to pull it off.”</p><p><strong>You’ve previously said <em>SHUTEN ORDER</em> is influenced by every <a title="Genres > Visual Novel [605 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/visual-novel">visual novel</a> you’ve loved. Can you share a couple of direct examples?</strong></p><p><strong>Kodaka:</strong> “<em>Cross Tantei Monogatari</em>, <em>Machi</em>, <em>Princess Tomato in the Salad Kingdom</em>, <em>Cross Channel</em>, <em><a title="Games > Clock Tower: Rewind [3 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/clock-tower-rewind">Clock Tower</a></em>, <em>428: Shibuya Scramble</em>,<br><em>The Portopia Serial Murder Case</em>, <em>Zero Escape</em>, <em>Ever 17</em>, <em>Ace Attorney</em>, <em>Higurashi When They Cry</em>, and <em>The Song of Saya</em>.”</p><p><strong>Most of Mr. Kodaka’s past works revolve around investigating murders. What keeps drawing you back to that theme, and what feels new about it this time?</strong></p><p><strong>Kodaka:</strong> “I’ve always loved mysteries, and I think it’s one of my strengths as a creator.</p><p>“Right now, whether you look at Japan or overseas, there really aren’t many game developers focusing primarily on mysteries, so I want to keep exploring that space. Of course, I enjoy working on other genres too.”</p><p><strong>The story is about pursuing the truth, but also making sacrifices. Can you talk more about the nature of these sacrifices, and how they affect the player?</strong></p><p><strong>Kodaka:</strong> “I can’t go into detail without spoilers, but the truth doesn’t always lead to a happy outcome. It can also reveal hardships.”</p><p><strong>How do you hope this game stands out from other mystery or <a title="Genres > Adventure [2,573 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/adventure">adventure games</a>? What do you hope sticks with the player after the story is complete?</strong></p><p><strong>Nakazawa:</strong> “There are two points that stand out.</p><p>“The first is that it’s a mystery that unfolds within the context of religion, a world where values differ from common sense. There are original tricks that are not found (and would not work) in other works.</p><p>“The second point is that the secrets hidden in the story can be revealed in any order. These secrets are spread across five routes. Players can choose to play through the routes in any order, so the order in which the secrets are revealed will be different for each player. This creates an experience that is unique for each player.</p><p>“After finishing the story, players will experience a distinct feeling that comes from this work, and at the same time, realize that it was a special experience that only they could have. That’s the way I see it.”</p><p><strong><em>SHUTEN ORDER</em> is currently only available for for Switch and PC. Is there any possibility we’ll see the game on PlayStation or Xbox in the future?</strong></p><p><strong>Kodaka:</strong> “DMM Games owns the property, so ultimately it’s up to them.”</p><p><strong>Thank you for your time, everyone!</strong></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2025/09/shuten-order-interview-with-kazutaka-kodaka-takumi-nakazawa-and-masafumi-takada-cults-mysteries-and-multiple-genres]]></content:encoded>

It's pretty explosive in details--literally, as the teams have modified a mechanic to make it way more deadly.</p><p>If you've played <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-6/" data-ref-id="5000-630093">Black Ops 6</a>, then you should be familiar with the Body Shield. Sneaking up behind your enemy, this mechanic lets you grab them and use their bodies to soak up bullets as you shoot your way through. It's already pretty brutal, but in Black Ops 7, it can become explosive as you tack a grenade onto your body shield's back for a fiery finish.</p>

<p>"Once you have your adversary locked into a Body Shield, you can jam a grenade onto them and shove them forward," the developers wrote in the post. "They’ll stagger for a few seconds before the grenade detonates and other enemies can be caught in the explosion."</p><p>Raven and Treyarch note that it's a "well-timed grenade," implying that a quick-time button press may be required for these fireworks. You can practice this until your fingers go blue in the Multiplayer Training menu. That way, you can always help your foes go out with a bang.</p><p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 comes out on November 14 for PC, PlayStation 4 and 5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X|S.

            <p>A lawsuit over the rights to the Sonic the Hedgehog song Live and Learn has been dismissed, but the songwriter claims the song "remains in 'limbo'".</p>
<p>Last year, Crush 40 musician and songwriter <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sonic-songwriter-sues-sega-over-ownership-of-iconic-live-and-learn-theme">Johnny Gioeli sued Sega of America over ownership of the Sonic Adventure 2 theme song</a>, ahead of its feature throughout the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/sonic-hedgehog-3">Sonic the Hedgehog 3</a> film.</p>
<p>At the time, Gioeli claimed Sega had the rights to the lyrics, but not the "master recording musical composition". However, "unbeknownst" to the songwriter, the company had "exploited and licensed" the song in "at least 25 video games, television shows, live performances/events and films".</p>

<p>In a new statement, Gioeli stated the case against Sega was dismissed "based on time, not on ownership" and so the song remains in "limbo".</p>
<p>The reason for the statement? Sonic's forthcoming appearance in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a> - we reported last week on leaks suggesting <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sonic-and-shadow-coming-to-fortnite-leaks-suggest-but-not-how-youd-expect">Sonic and Shadow are headed to the battle royale</a>.</p>
<p>"Just two weeks ago, I was contacted by Epic Games to potentially use Live and Learn," stated Gioeli, "and the amazing part is Sega had them call ME for the rights to use the song. So there you have it. The most epic song remains in the 'abyss of ownership'."</p>
<p>Gioeli added: "The song is mine. I wrote it with Jun [Senoue], I sing it, I created the melody, I recorded my vocals in my studio, and they do not own it."</p> <div>

<p>News of the lawsuit emerged last year ahead of both Sonic x Shadow Generations and the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sonic-the-hedgehog-3-film-review">Sonic the Hedgehog 3 film</a>, both of which make use of the song in their soundtracks.</p>
<p>Gioeli's latest comments precede not just the Fortnite collaboration, but the release this week of Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds.</p>
<p>A leak last week, showed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sonic-racing-crossworlds-leak-reveals-more-iconic-characters-coming-to-its-roster-which-retro-fans-will-love">more unannounced DLC is on the way to the racing game</a>.</p>

<p>Parts of Daft Punk's extensive back-catalogue will be available in Fortnite, starting with a supercut of the 2007 album <em>Alive</em> and the accompanying tour. (thanks, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/wario64.bsky.social/post/3lzgl7hf4r32p">Wario64</a>!)</p>
<p>You'll be able to remix a bunch of the duo's songs, make a music video in LEGO, get new furniture from fine furniture designer <a href="https://hervet-manufacturier.com/">Hervet Manufacturier</a>, and much more, all in the run up to a big afterparty...</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067xmyzhi&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>And, as with any collaboration, there are tons of new outfits and accessories to purchase and decor bundles to furnish your space. Though we're <em>pretty</em> partial to that Daft Punk Pyramid Build, which apparently lights up in-sync with music.</p>


<p>We don't know how long the Daft Punk Experience will be going on in Fortnite (Epic has only said "for a while"), so if you want to get down to the dance floor and go around the world, then you can do just that starting from this Saturday.</p>
<p>You can find all of the details on the experience over on <a href="https://www.fortnite.com/news/party-harder-better-faster-stronger-in-fortnite-with-the-daft-punk-experience">the official Fortnite website</a>. But it's worth noting that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/fortnite_festival">Fortnite Festival</a> Season 10 also has some pretty good music going on right now in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/gorillaz-dare-to-headline-fortnite-festival-season-10">the form of headliners Gorillaz</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>This past Friday afternoon, Microsoft <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-series-x-s-prices-will-reportedly-go-up-again-in-us-microsoft/">quietly announced</a> that it would be raising the price for its Xbox Series X/S consoles in the United States, with the Series X getting a $50 increase, the 2TB Series X getting a $70 increase, and the Series S getting a $20 increase starting October 3. It's the second price jump for the Xbox console line this year, meaning that when we finally get to Oct.3, in the US alone, the Series S will have gone up $100, the Series X $150, and the 2TB Series X variant will have jumped up $200 in price.</p>



<p>Many have been quick to point to the current US administration's new tariffs as the real reason behind these price jumps, or as Microsoft puts it, "<em>changes in the macroeconomic environment</em>." According to former Blizzard president Mike Ybarra, however, that's only part of the story.</p>



<p>In a post on <a href="https://x.com/Qwik/status/1969178567490597232">X (formerly Twitter)</a>, Ybarra plainly states, "<em>Console price increases are not tariff issues, they are profit issues</em>. <em>And the reason why profits are not where they should be is a far, far deeper issue vs. the tariff excuse.</em>"</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Console price increases are not tariff issues, they are profit issues. And the reason why profits are not where they should be is a far, far deeper issue vs. the tariff excuse.</p>— Mike Ybarra 😇 (@Qwik) <a href="https://twitter.com/Qwik/status/1969178567490597232?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 19, 2025</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>He further clarifies that he's pointing out that the tariffs only account for one price increase. This second jump in price "<em>is simply a different problem and they are going to make consumers continue to pay for those problems</em>," while tariffs remain "<em>an excuse to continue raising prices</em>."</p>



<p>The tariffs introduced this year are undoubtedly part of the price increases on hardware from <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-us-price-changes-nintendo-switch-2/">Nintendo</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/ps5-ps5-pro-price-increases-us-tomorrow/">PlayStation</a>, and Xbox. But Ybarra isn't exactly wrong to point out that Microsoft raising its prices a second time, and the struggles it faces when competing with PlayStation and Nintendo go deeper and started well before this year's tariffs came into the equation.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/cancer-stricken-streamer-scammed-for-30k-by-malware-riddled-steam-game.1304466/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A streamer battling stage 4 cancer has been scammed to the tune of around $30,000 by a Steam game that concealed cryptodrain malware, and while the game has been removed, it remained online for around three weeks with the malware infecting its code.</p>

<p>As spotted by ResetEra user <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/streamer-rastaland-raising-money-for-his-stage-4-cancer-treatment-gets-30k-stolen-from-steam-game-containing-malware-while-streaming.1303938/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Atheerios</a>, streamer rastaland, who is suffering from a stage 4 sarcoma (which means the cancer has metastasized to other parts of his body), was tricked into downloading a Steam demo by the name of&nbsp;<em>BlockBlasters</em>, which&nbsp;contained a cryptodrainer.</p>

<p>If you're not sure what a cryptodrainer is, it's essentially a malicious piece of software that drains cryptocurrency from users' wallets (hence the name). As rastaland himself <a href="https://x.com/rastalandtv/status/1969629808788181258" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">says</a>, the malware drained him for "over $32,000" in creator fees earned through crypto platform pump.fun.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/blockblasters-streamer-scam-game.jpg?itok=fon6Iud6 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/blockblasters-streamer-scam-game.jpg?itok=Ydho9znT 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The Steam game&nbsp;<em>BlockBlasters&nbsp;</em>(which has since been removed) tricked streamer rastaland out of $30,000.</figcaption></figure><p>You can see rastaland realizing what's happened in <a href="https://x.com/vxunderground/status/1969786282831130872" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">this clip</a> posted by X user vx-underground. Honestly, I'd recommend against watching it because it's completely heartbreaking, but if you'd like to get all your ducks in a row, it's there for you to watch.</p>

<p>As reported by cyber defense blog <a href="https://www.gdatasoftware.com/blog/2025/09/38265-steam-blockblasters-game-downloads-malware" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">G Data</a>,&nbsp;<em>BlockBlasters&nbsp;</em>seemingly didn't contain any malicious code until August 30th, when the cryptodrainer in question was added to the game. G Data's report also contains a great rundown of how exactly the drainer works and what you can watch out for to avoid being scammed yourself.</p>

<p>G Data points out that this isn't the first instance of malware being injected into Steam games; other examples include free-to-play survival sims&nbsp;<em>PirateFi&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Chemia</em>, both of which were compromised by malicious updates.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/chemia-scam-cryptodrainer-steam.jpg?itok=brvatRhM 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/chemia-scam-cryptodrainer-steam.jpg?itok=0Lr34Rj7 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Chemia&nbsp;</em>is another example of a Steam game injected with malware.</figcaption></figure><p>All three of the games I've mentioned in this article have now been removed from Steam, but according to <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/3872350/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">SteamDB</a>, two people are still playing&nbsp;<em>BlockBlasters&nbsp;</em>on Steam right now. If that's you and you're reading this, I'd strongly recommend backing out of the game and deleting it.</p>

<p>As for rastaland, he's apparently been <a href="https://x.com/rastalandTV/status/1969993892889027069" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">inundated</a> with support and kind words from his community, and it looks like crypto enthusiast Alex Becker <a href="https://x.com/ZssBecker/status/1969774353211695441" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">sent</a> the streamer enough money to cover the loss, which is a lovely gesture.</p>

<p>This feels to me like a pretty sobering reminder to be extremely careful when getting involved with anything Web3-related, whatever <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/might-and-magic-fates-blockchain-mobile" rel="nofollow">certain major publishers</a>&nbsp;may <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/immensely-popular-classic-sega-franchise-will-become-nft-game" rel="nofollow">tell you</a>.

It is written that when the Sumerian king Gilgamesh first beheld the gleaming ramparts of Uruk‐Haven, many centuries ago, he said unto his architects: "be sure to save up gaps for those long straight ones, and try your best to start a multiplier". But then Gilgamesh realised that, by means of temporal fluctuations too nonsensical to explain, he was actually looking at the submissions page for <a href="https://bsky.app/hashtag/FallingBlockJam">Falling Block Jam 2025</a>, the latest Itch.io "make a thing with a theme" festival, which ran from last week till today. 
</p><!--more-->
<p>
Falling block games! Such a simple concept, capable of so many perversions. I have played a handful of<a href="https://itch.io/jam/falling-block-jam/entries"> the jam's 239 entries</a> and found them to be enjoyable, if often rudimentary. As is the style round these parts, I will now try to briefly communicate their enjoyableness to you using words. This is honestly going to be quite difficult, because I keep seeing another entry I want to try.
</p>
<p>
A pretty one to start: <a href="https://fayer.itch.io/bloquecitos">Bloquecitos</a> is a Tetrislike with real-time physics, and blocks that merge to create different-shaped blocks when you match their patterns. It's a crafty rejig of the developer's previous <a href="https://fayer.itch.io/pancitomerge">Pancitomerge</a>. I'm fond of the mosaic tile patterns, and I like engineering cascades by merging two blocks so that others tumble together.

<p>
<a href="https://apotheum.itch.io/this-side-up">This Side Up</a>, meanwhile, trades the "falling" component of the "falling block" genre for a gradually retreating 3D camera. You've got a shipping crate and you're trying to fill it with vintage household objects such as cacti, cathode-ray televisions, Nintendo Gamecubes, and lizard tanks.</p><p>I strongly relate to this one inasmuch as I had a bunch of stuff in lock-up during a flat move last year. There's a dark art to filling shipping crates so as to optimise both storage space and retrievability. I do not claim to have mastered this art. After all, I managed to divide up all my paired belongings between separate crates. I had left socks and saucepans in one box, right socks and saucepan lids in another. Get ye behind me, This Side Up! You are bringing back traumatic memories.

<p>
<a href="https://datagoblin.itch.io/bone-scrambler">Professor Gambler's Bone Scrambler</a> is a falling block game born of the fateful realisation that a thrown die is a kind of falling block. Each turn, it rolls out a line of dice. You then slide the line horizontally to match the blocks below and create combos, or spend points to reroll the set. How do you earn points? From combos. It's got nice chiptune aesthetics, as you might expect from a game that has also been submitted to <a href="https://itch.io/jam/gbjam-13">GBJAM 13</a>.
</p>
<p>
A Pico-8 one next. In <a href="https://werxzy.itch.io/recycled-blocks">Recycled Blocks</a>, you control a little laser drone that has to sculpt blocks as they fall to complete work orders and remove them from the board. I found the control scheme a bit confusing, but I love the concept. Ditto the self-explanatory <a href="https://sunrysky.itch.io/circuit-makers">Circuit Makers</a>.</p><p><a href="https://walaber-ent.itch.io/jelly-well">Jelly Well</a>, meanwhile, gets two thumbs up for its subliminal hatred of LocoRocos and for its soundscape of human mouth noises. More of this kind of thing, please. Call of Duty games would sell twice as much if all the gun effects consisted of voice actors yelling "bang". I would hire Sir Anthony Hopkins to voice an AK47, myself.
</p>

</figure>
<p>
Simply scrolling the Falling Block Jam submission feed makes me feel as though I'm losing badly at Tetris, so I'll resist the urge to write up any more. OK, one more, but only because it doesn't require a computer: <a href="https://npckc.itch.io/doctorvsvirus">Doctor Vs Virus</a> is a table-top falling block game you can play with a standard deck of cards.</p>
<p>If you see any others you like, please rotate and slide them dextrously into the comments below. Why not see if you can form a line with people recommending the same game - I'll try to add some block-clearing score attack functionality to our moderation software.

              <p>Nobody should have to decide which one of their devices gets the fast charger while the other ones get the slow version, or none at all. You carry your smartphone and earbuds and wear your smartwatch at the same time, so you should be able to fast-charge them the same way.</p>
<p>That’s what Anker’s MagGo 3-in-1 charging station does for your Apple devices, including the brand-new iPhone 17, Apple Watch 11, SE 3, and Ultra, and AirPods 4 and Pro 3. They all get 15W charging power, and your desk or nightstand get a clean, organized look with just one cable for 3 devices. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4221/">Speaking of cleaning up, that’s what you’ll be doing with this limited-time Amazon sale that cuts the price of the MagGo 3-in-1 charging station by 30%, down to just $63.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4221/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Apple Certified</h2>
<p>The Anker MagGo 3-in-1 charging station is one of the rare chargers that’s officially certified by Apple as a fast charger for the Apple Watch. It’s powerful and fast enough to bring an Apple Watch Series 10 from 0 to a full charge in just an hour and 13 minutes — over 2 hours less than other wireless chargers. (It’s not compatible with Samsung or other non-Apple smartwatches.)</p>
<p>That amazing speed also applies to your MagSafe-compatible iPhone — watch your iPhone 16 Pro Max go from totally dead to 20% in just 20 minutes, a task which takes a 7.5W wireless charger over twice as long. And the Qi pad at the rear of the stand is a perfect fit for your AirPods wireless charging case, with a non-slip surface to prevent you (or your cat) from knocking them off in the middle of the night.</p>



<h2>Nightstand Upgrade</h2>
<p>The MagGo is a charging&nbsp;<em>stand</em>, so let’s not lose sight of that feature. Your iPhone charges with equal speed in portrait or landscape position, and the powerful MagSafe grip holds the phone in place and allows you to tilt it back vertically by as much as 45 degrees. That’s perfect if you want to watch a video or take a FaceTime call at your desk hands-free while your phone charges, and on your nightstand, your iPhone can be placed in StandBy mode and act as your bedside clock, all while receiving an optimal charge.</p>
<p>Anker’s rep for top-of-the-line charging device is well established, especially for the Apple ecosystem. This one’s not going to damage that rep one bit — <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4221/">the MagGo 3-in-1 fast charger earned an Amazon’s Choice tag, and this 30% limited-time deal makes it a $63 steal</a> that will keep your devices charged and your desk or nightstand organized.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/why-major-events-like-charlie-kirk%E2%80%99s-death-end-up-on-roblox.1304448/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>It took mere hours after Charlie Kirk’s death at Utah Valley University before recreations of the scene—in which suspect Tyler Robinson allegedly shot Kirk from a nearby rooftop—started appearing on <em>Roblox</em>. Rendered in <em>Roblox</em>’s crude, low fidelity style, people quickly created experiences (what Roblox calls the different games and locations on its platform) that lets users participate in or watch the killing play out. The following day, Roblox said it had removed <a href="https://www.axios.com/2025/09/11/charlie-kirk-shooting-roblox-game-removed" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">more than 100 experiences</a> that referenced the event.&nbsp;</p><p>It’s very likely these experiences drew <a href="https://corp.roblox.com/newsroom/2025/09/roblox-annual-economic-impact-report" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">just a tiny fraction of <em>Roblox</em>’s 111.8 million average daily users</a>. (One clip shared on X of an experience called "assassinate charlie kirk” <a href="https://x.com/crusty83106/status/1966289140473016497/video/1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reported 12 active players</a> at the time the video was recorded.) But the recreations of Kirk’s death found a wider audience when clips started circulating on TikTok and X, where they’ve received thousands of views, reposts, and likes. <a href="https://x.com/jackunheard/status/1966255591036432886/photo/1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Several posts on social media suggest</a> that some users were selling <em>Roblox</em> avatar skins designed to look like the T-shirt Kirk was wearing during the event, often with blood around the neckline. (Aftermath observed at least one of these avatars still available in Roblox at the time of writing.)</p><p>On Sept. 12, <a href="https://x.com/DavidBaszucki/status/1966550631327658374" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Roblox CEO David Baszucki responded</a> to a post regarding the <em>Roblox</em> experiences from Florida representative and a former staffer for Kirk’s organization Turning Point USA Anna Paulina Luna—<a href="https://www.axios.com/2025/09/11/charlie-kirk-shooting-house-boebert-luna" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">who, while on the House floor, blamed Democrats for Kirk’s killing</a>. Baszucki said he was “saddened by the passing of Charlie Kirk" and continued, “Our Community Standards prohibit content and behavior that re-enacts specific real world violent or sensitive events or promotes terrorism or hatred against individuals or groups, and we do not allow any image or video sharing in chat.”</p><p>Though the juxtaposition of a graphic shooting and the childish nature of <em>Roblox</em> can be jarring, that the event quickly showed up in these spaces is not. It doesn’t matter the event: <a href="https://aftermath.site/fortnite-roblox-minecraft-steam-trump-assassination-attempt" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">As Aftermath’s Nathan Grayson put it last year</a>, “this clockwork cycle plays out following almost any event of significance; the modern internet has been engineered for it.”</p><p>When a shooter attempted to assassinate Donald Trump during his presidential campaign last year, recreations of the event popped up in <em>Fortnite</em>, <em>Minecraft</em>, and yes, <em>Roblox</em>. There have been players who <a href="https://kotaku.com/roblox-school-shootings-columbine-ass-adl-report-kids-1851777207" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recreate school shootings</a>. People roleplay crossing the Mexican border, playing as both migrants and border control. There has been <a href="https://youtu.be/vjEjU9uFUhk?feature=shared&amp;t=398" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">an experience in which players encounter an assassinated JFK</a> and must complete an obstacle course to find the killer. Often, recreations spread further than the players who have actively participated even after being taken offline, thanks to social media platforms like Instagram, TikTok, and X.</p><p>Dr. Rachel Kowert, <a href="https://www.takethis.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/ExtremismInGames_APrimer_FINAL-1.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a psychologist who studies extremism in games</a>, told Aftermath that some of these in-game scenarios—she pointed specifically to recreations of Columbine and playing as a Nazi in World War 2 games in <em>Roblox</em>—could be explained as propaganda designed to radicalize people. She said there may be some of that when making and spreading <em>Roblox</em> experiences recreating Kirk’s death. Recreations of these sorts of events may also be a way for young people to “recreate and process” an experience; lots of people were "inadvertently exposed” to videos of the actual shooting with clips shared widely on social media, she said. “I would hypothesize that’s a minority of people, but it is a possibility.”</p><p>Of course, that doesn’t mean <em>Roblox</em> should be used as the place to process traumatic events. “If you need to roleplay process, go to therapy,” Kowert said. “These places are town squares. Not everyone wants to roleplay process that, like not everybody wants to see it on their TikTok feed.”</p><p>The reality of internet culture, though, is that it’s very hard to ascribe actual intention to memes—and these <em>Roblox</em> experiences are often memes. It’s the same culture that bewildered mainstream media in interpreting the engravings on the bullets used by suspected shooter Tyler Robinson; what was originally described as “<a href="https://www.wsj.com/livecoverage/charlie-kirk-shot/card/ammunition-in-kirk-shooting-engraved-with-transgender-antifascist-ideology-sources-pdymd1sXXMSlVRhpvR4b" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">transgender and anti-fascist ideology</a>” ended up being references to video games and internet culture. <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/09/16/us/text-message-tyler-robinson-roomate-vis" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Robinson allegedly said so himself in text messages sent</a> after the killing: “remember how I was engraving bullets? The fuckin messages are mostly a big meme, if I see ‘notices bulges uwu’ on fox new[s] I might have a stroke.”</p><p>Memes are essentially a social currency online. Recreating violent events through memes can give a rush of attention and the thrill of being edgy. They often go viral on social media platforms like TikTok, which leads to an influx of clicks and views. This attention can translate into gain; sometimes it’s actual currency, as in the case of the Kirk assassination, where people were selling cosmetic items referencing the event.</p><p>“It’s impossible to know who’s doing it for the lulls and the clicks and who’s doing it because they’re radicalizing or actively trying to cognitively change the way you view and see the world,” Kowert said. “That’s why you can have none of it, because you can’t tell which is which.”</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/aftermath-hours-podcast-charlie-kirk-killer-steam-discord"><h3>What A Shock, The Government Is Scapegoating Video Games Again</h3></a><p>"That nihilism isn’t really reflected or addressed in either political party"</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/arma-trans-platoon"><h3>Arma Can Be A Boys Club, But This Trans Women-Only Platoon Aims To Change That</h3></a><p>'It’s a community that is made for the trans community...

Now called "Wall Jumps," the ability to hop off of walls is coming to the new Call of Duty game as part of updates to the Omnimovement system.</p><p>In a <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2025/09/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-multiplayer-deep-dive" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">long blog post</a> revealing details about Black Ops 7's multiplayer mode, developers Treyarch and Raven Software detailed how players will be able to jump off walls. Most notably, Black Ops 7 will restrict when and how you can use this traversal option. Wall Jumps will only be available on certain surfaces that are marked with special icons, and each Wall Jump will reduce the player's momentum. Three Wall Jumps can be chained together without needing to return to flat ground.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 | Multiplayer Gameplay Reveal Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>Running on walls has appeared in occasionally in past Call of Duty games, <a href="https://callofduty.fandom.com/wiki/Wall_Running" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">most notably Black Ops 3</a>. In that game, players wore exoskeletons that allowed them to run, boost, and jump across walls, although its implementation was met with a mixed reception.</p><p>Wall Jumps are just one of numerous changes coming to multiplayer that were shown off in the blog post. Black Ops 7 will also feature a significant modification to the way that Tactical Sprint works, and players can now use Body Shield to booby-trap enemies. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-multiplayer-trailer-shows-off-all-18-maps-coming-at-launch/1100-6534905/" data-ref-id="1100-6534905">Finally, all the maps and modes coming at launch have been revealed</a>.</p><p>Black Ops 7 launches on November 4, but you can check it out before that via a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-beta-start-time-how-to-get-in-and-everything-else-to-know/1100-6534073/" data-ref-id="1100-6534073">multiplayer beta that kicks off in early October.</a> For more, check out our overview of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-2025-everything-we-know-about-rumored-black-ops-2-sequel/1100-6529073/" data-ref-id="1100-6529073">everything to expect from Black Ops 7</a>.</p>

In December, Barone said <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/stardew-valley-creator-reconfirms-next-task-is-haunted-chocolatier/1100-6528253/">he was resuming work on Haunted Chocolatier</a> after finishing up the Stardew Valley 1.6 update.

But in the meantime, he likes doing updates for the original game. "It's so much easier to just add more stuff to Stardew Valley than to make a whole new game from scratch," Barone said on a podcast in May.</p>

                <p>Just before the holiday rush comes to a head, Nintendo of America will reportedly start outsourcing its customer service support in October. However, the company disputes that it's doing anything but continuing to "evolve and expand [its] customer service experiences.</p><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-customer-support-concern-following-outsourcing-decision-ahead-of-switch-2s-first-holiday-season" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN reports</a> that Nintendo of America is shifting all its customer service-related operations from the U.S. to South American countries. The contractors who performed these duties--which include "back office teams, fraud, financials, chargebacks, customer services, chatlogs, customer phone and email support, refunds, account bans, remote data transfers, repair support, everything customer support," as one described--will see their contracts phased out at the end of September. It's estimated that 200 workers will be impacted, many of whom have worked with the company for years. One contractor said that while there are still a few people running these operations on-site, "it’s all going away."</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Nintendo Switch 2 Console Review</p>
      </div>
<p>According to the contractors IGN spoke to on the condition of anonymity, Nintendo of America didn't provide any communication on the decision. However, as their employment comes to an end, the contractors must still help train the new hires before leaving their roles.</p><p>This, along with the language barrier, has created frustrations for everyone, the contractors said. As a result, the workers being let go fear that the quality of Nintendo of America's customer service will suffer in the long term. Contactors said Nintendo of America's decision has already produced a noticeable increase in irate or belligerent customers, with one person saying they've seen customers use racial slurs towards agents.</p><p>Nintendo of America said the claims in IGN's article are "inaccurate," refuting them in the face of its "high-quality" service:  </p><p>"While we have nothing to announce about our internal business activities, the claims shared with IGN include inaccurate information. At Nintendo of America, we are extremely thankful to have partnered with several companies and their talented contractors over the years to deliver high-quality customer service experiences. We continue to evolve and expand our customer service model with external partners that have deep experience in all the markets we serve across the Americas. This approach allows us to support the full scope of our customer service mission in both North America and our growing Latin American markets, and better scale to seasonal needs for consistent support. As always, our top priority is to provide excellent customer support, and we are pleased that customer satisfaction with the service provided by all our partners remains positive."</p><p>This all comes on the heels of the Nintendo Switch 2's massive success. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-sales-massively-outpacing-switch-1-sales-so-far-in-the-us/1100-6534305/" data-ref-id="1100-6534305">Outpacing the original</a> just a handful of months on the market, the console-handheld hybrid has already <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-sales-blast-past-expectations-now-6-million-globally/1100-6533625/" data-ref-id="1100-6533625">sold more than six million units globally</a>. The Switch 2 is an evidently very in-demand console right now, and as it enters its first holiday season, "high-quality" customer service will remain more important.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/resident-evil-requiem-will-feature-a-large-interconnected-story-and-grounded-action-elements-%E2%80%93-rumor.1304412/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/resident-evil-requiem/">Resident Evil Requiem</a> is shaping up to be one of the most ambitious entries in years, and the <a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-requiem-gamescom-hands-on-preview-turn-on-the-lights/">demo</a> I tried during <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/gamescom-2025/">Gamescom</a> last month proved how the whole experience will be elevated by high-quality ray-traced lighting and layered sound design, which made every dark corridor haunting and every escape attempt tense, even in a noisy, expo environment. And if new rumors are to be believed, Resident Evil Requiem may also deliver the most complex narrative the series has seen.</p>



<p>In a new video shared on YouTube by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@ROEnetwork">Residence of Evil</a>, well-known leaker Dusk Golem went over the rumors currently circulating regarding the next entry in the series launching next year, revealing some additional, previously unknown details. As previously mentioned, Leon will be the second playable character in the game besides Grace, and the classic Resident Evil series protagonist will feature in the ninth entry in the series with an older appearance - unshaven and with greying hair. </p>



<p>Leon's gameplay segments, which are expected to be revealed during this week's Tokyo Game Show, will be action-oriented, but in a more grounded sort of way than <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/resident-evil-4/">Resident Evil 4</a> or <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/resident-evil-village-horror-greatest-hits/">Resident Evil Village</a>, doing away with enemies like possessed statues and more. Generally, the insider expects these action segments, which will take place in larger environments also featuring vehicles to move from one location to another, similar to the boat section in Resident Evil 4, to be compared to <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-last-of-us-part-ii-remastered-the-definitive-package/">The Last of Us Part II gameplay.</a></p>



<p>The most interesting thing Dusk Golem revealed about Resident Evil Requiem is how Grace's and Leon's campaigns will be set in different years. Most of Grace's campaign will be set in 2028, while Leon's in 2020, and both will form a large, cohesive and interconnected story. While the Resident Evil series has often featured different campaigns with different main characters interconnected on some levels, this would be the first time this element is brought to such a scale.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="RESIDENT EVIL 9: REQUIEM | NEW LEAKS! | LEON REVEAL, GAMEPLAY, VEHICLES &amp; More!" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NnvzOMHoDL4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>While Dusk Golem proved to have access to insider information in the past, we still have to take everything revealed in the video above with a healthy grain of salt. Thankfully, it's very likely we won't have to wait much longer to see Leon's new appearance and gameplay. No matter when this reval will occur, we know for certain we won't have to wait until Resident Evil Requiem launches on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S, and Nintendo Switch on February 27, 2026 to learn more about its more action-focused elements.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fortnite-daft-punk-collab</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/fortnite-daft-punk-collab-confirmed-launches-later-this-week.1304409/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Epic Games has announced the latest band to make its way into&nbsp;<em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em>as a crossover, and it's none other than legendary French house duo Daft Punk, who will feature in the game as an "experience" later this week.</p>

<p>As revealed in an <a href="https://www.fortnite.com/news/party-harder-better-faster-stronger-in-fortnite-with-the-daft-punk-experience?lang=en-US" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">official blog post</a>,&nbsp;<em>Fortnite</em>'s Daft Punk Experience will begin on September 27th, and rather than just consisting of a few songs for&nbsp;<em>Fortnite Festival&nbsp;</em>or a couple of skins, it'll serve as a full-scale "sonic journey", according to Epic.</p>

<p>In the post, Epic says the experience will take players to a "transformative dancefloor destination" where they'll be able to "remix Daft Punk's music at Dream Chamber Studios" or "blast hordes of robots with a soundwave laser in the Robot Rock Arena".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/fortnite-daft-punk-collab-skins.jpg?itok=5b-1BR1N 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/fortnite-daft-punk-collab-skins.jpg?itok=wY2SvpAe 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Fortnite</em>'s new Daft Punk collab isn't just skins, but those are on offer too.</figcaption></figure><p>If that doesn't tickle your fancy, then perhaps you'd prefer to "make a Lego music video at Around the World" or "hit the Daft Club to dance til dawn". Furniture company Hervet Manufacturier, which has worked with Daft Punk in the past, will also have several virtual pieces displayed throughout the experience.</p>

<p>Epic is also promising an "afterparty" for the Daft Punk experience, but the studio is keeping the details close to its chest for now, promising to reveal more info about that "at a later date".</p>

<p>Of course, if you do want to pick up some Daft Punk skins for your&nbsp;<em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em>character, you can do so with a new bundle that launches this Thursday. It's got two new outfits and a bunch of accessories for you to spruce up your battle royale-ing with.</p>

<p>Daft Punk is far from the first artist to feature in&nbsp;<em>Fortnite</em>. The duo follows on from the likes of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fortnite-festival-hatsune-miku-crossover" rel="nofollow">Hatsune Miku</a>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fortnite-festival-reveals-first-glimpse-of-weeknd-gameplay" rel="nofollow">The Weeknd</a>, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fortnite-the-big-bang-eminem" rel="nofollow">rap legend Eminem</a>, among many others.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/fortnite-eminem-skins.jpg?itok=HMJkSiLA 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/fortnite-eminem-skins.jpg?itok=n0xRxKau 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Daft Punk isn't the first artist to get its own&nbsp;<em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em>skins.</figcaption></figure><p>News of the&nbsp;<em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em>Daft Punk collab follows the announcement of a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fortnite-v-bucks-exact-amount" rel="nofollow">new exact amount-focused V-Bucks purchasing option</a> earlier this month, allowing you to buy only the V-Bucks you need for skins and accessories instead of buying bundles and having currency left over.</p>

<p><em>Fortnite</em>'s Daft Punk collab lands on September 27th, and the "grand opening" for the event kicks off at 2pm Eastern that day, so make sure to be there if you want to see it all begin.</p>

		<p>I'm not sure what to do with myself. The Chicago Bears looked...good? Excellent? Yes, yes, I know the Cowboys defense is notoriously bad and yes, yes the Bears nearly gave up a franchise high amount of points to the Lions just one week ago—but let me have this moment. Let me hold onto it, before it slips away a week from now. We'll probably do exactly that on a podcast I'm about to record with Rob, but if you're also wondering "Hey, I wanna hear more about stuff going horribly wrong at Rob's house," don't worry, we have an entire HOA in the bank that you'll hear in the near future. I'm told that even in the weeks since recording that, there's more to talk about it. Somehow, I should not be surprised.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Daft Punk, one of the biggest electronic dance music groups in history, is coming soon to <a href="https://kotaku.com/gaijin-war-thunder-fortnite-the-pit-deal-millions-epic-1851786813"><em>Fortnite</em></a> alongside some classic tracks, Lego skins, new emotes, and also a big confirmation from Epic that, no, they aren’t getting back together. Sorry.</p> <p>On September 22, after some online leaks and teases, <a href="https://www.fortnite.com/news/party-harder-better-faster-stronger-in-fortnite-with-the-daft-punk-experience">Epic officially announced that Daft Punk</a> was coming to <em>Fortnite</em> as part of a large in-game event. The robotic duo will arrive in Epic’s ever-growing battle royale on September 27 as part of something called the “Daft Punk Experience.” This will be an in-game location that players can visit alone or with friends, and it will feature various activities, including the ability to remix Daft Punk’s music, a horde mode featuring robots, and a dance club.</p> <p>But before all that, on September 25, cosmetic items based on the duo will be added to <a href="https://kotaku.com/fortnite-missing-characters-wishlist-grimace-agent-47-weird-al-star-trek-2000617211"><em>Fortnite’s</em> in-game shop</a>. Cosmetics include multiple Daft Punk outfits, emotes, weapon skins, in-game music tracks, and even some adorable Lego minifigs based on the famous robots.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000627583" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000627583"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000627583">©Epic Games / Daft Punk</figcaption></figure> <p>Now, if you’re a big fan of Daft Punk like me, you might see all this news and start thinking that maybe, just maybe, the duo is about to get back together. Perhaps this is just a tease of something bigger. A new album? A new song? A new tour? Well, bad news: Epic makes it very clear in the post announcing all of the new <em>Fortnite</em> x Daft Punk content that, no, the group is not getting back together. First, Epic starts the post off with a mention of the group being “no longer” around and then, to make it very clear, Epic included this in the event’s FAQ:</p> <blockquote> <ul> <li><em>Is Daft Punk getting back together?</em></li> <li>No. The Daft Punk Experience is an immersive music experience based on the band’s beloved music. The band is not getting back together.</li> </ul> </blockquote> <p>So there you go. Sorry about that. Of course, if they wanted it to be a surprise, that’s exactly what they would say. So perhaps there is still a chance… (Editor’s note: It’s not happening, Zack. Move on.)</p>

                <p>A new trailer for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-2025-everything-we-know-about-rumored-black-ops-2-sequel/1100-6529073/" data-ref-id="1100-6529073">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</a> has arrived, and this one is focused entirely on multiplayer. The trailer shows off all 18 multiplayer maps that will be available at launch and all footage was captured in-game. The trailer is set to the song "FE!N" from Travis Scott ft. Playboi Carti.</p><p>The trailer shows off some of the new traversal systems, too, including wall-jumping, while some of the new scorestreaks, guns, and gadgets are on display here as well. Black Ops 7 is set in the year 2035, which helps explain why some of the gameplay looks semi-futuristic. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>A new survey shared on <a href="https://x.com/MGSMGN/status/1969354623007014979">X (formerly Twitter) by user Metal Gear Network</a> (spotted by <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/konami-asked-fans-which-metal-gear-remade/">Insider-Gaming</a>) reveals that Konami wants to know which Metal Gear Solid game fans think should get the remake treatment next, now that we're beyond the release of Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://questant.jp/q/7DNR3EOO">survey</a> is entirely in Japanese, so unless you can read it or have a translation tool handy, you'll probably struggle to answer the questions to be able to submit your choice. But the key takeaway here is that Konami is clearly trying to gauge what fans want to see next.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>The choices presented in the survey are: </p>



<ul>
<li>Metal Gear</li>



<li>Metal Gear 2 Solid Snake</li>



<li>Metal Gear Solid</li>



<li>Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty</li>



<li>Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots</li>



<li>Metal Gear Solid: Peace Walker</li>



<li>Metal Gear Solid V: Ground Zeroes</li>



<li>Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain</li>



<li>Other (with a box to type in your selection)</li>
</ul>



<p>We know that there is more MGS on the horizon, if only through the coming release of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/metal-gear-solid-4-peace-walker-mgs5-references-found-in-metal-gear-solid-master-collection-files/">MGS: Master Collection Vol. 2</a>, which is said to include MGS4, MGS: Peace Walker, and MGSV. Those wouldn't be major remakes or touch-ups of the aforementioned titles, though; they'd be in line with the first volume of the Master Collection, which is, they'd just be a means of playing the series on modern hardware. Of course, there's a larger question around what this would mean for MGS4 due to it currently being marooned on PlayStation 3, but that's a whole different topic.</p>



<p> So far, the MGSD: Snake Eater remake has had a strong commercial start, <a href="https://wccftech.com/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-million-seller-day-one/">selling over 1 million copies in its first day,</a> according to Konami. It's also had a strong critical start, with players and critics (<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-ps5-review-based-on-a-hideo-kojima-game/">Wccftech included</a>) praising the remake for its efforts in updating what many consider to be one of the best stealth-action games out there.</p>



<p>From an external point of view, strong sales and critical reception should be exactly what Konami wanted out of the MGSD: Snake Eater remake, so why not move forward and pick another game in the series to repeat it with? Besides MGS2: Sons of Liberty, MGS3: Snake Eater was the riskiest game to remake, because it's the one that most of the series fans hold in higher regard than the rest.</p>



<p>Just like it did with <a href="https://wccftech.com/silent-hill-2-remake-sells-over-2-million-units-worldwide/">Silent Hill 2</a>, Konami got the most difficult one off the board first, and by all means, knocked it out of the park. There will be high expectations for whatever comes next, but at least we can have some confidence in what Konami is trying to do with the series.</p>



<p>So, which game would you pick to get the same treatment that MGS3 got next? Personally, I don't need any of them to get a remake, I'd just like to be able to play my beloved MGS4 without having to boot up my aging PS3.</p>
