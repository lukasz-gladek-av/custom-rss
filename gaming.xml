            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/reviews/23916193/aggro-dr1ft-review-travis-scott-harmony-korine-incel-gamer-movie<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="X8EDwA"><small><em>This review of </em></small><small>AGGRO DR1FT</small><small><em> was originally published after its screening at the 2023 New York Film Festival. It has been updated and republished for the film’s limited theatrical run. </em></small></p>
<p id="xSLyh3">It’s rare to see a movie that challenges basic ideas about how films are made or what they should look like. It’s even rarer to see a movie in that mode that’s actually enjoyable. <em>AGGRO DR1FT</em>, from <em>Spring Breakers</em> and <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2019/3/29/18286004/the-beach-bum-review-matthew-mcconaughey"><em>The Beach Bum</em></a> director Harmony Korine, made in collaboration with <a href="https://www.travisscott.com/utopia-world/">rapper and music producer Travis Scott</a>, certainly doesn’t look like any kind of conventional movie, but it also isn’t an exception to the rule. It’s strange and mostly eventless — some viewers will probably jump ship on after five minutes or less. But it’s also utterly fascinating in the rare moments when it’s actually coherent. </p>
<p id="zCf2k7"><em>AGGRO DR1FT</em> follows BO (Jordi Mollà), a middle-aged man who loves his wife and children deeply. He’s also the world’s greatest assassin. He tells the audience both of these things directly, via omnipresent voice-over narration. The majority of the movie has BO wandering aimlessly around Florida from one meeting to the next. The encounters are only linked by his narration, which seems related to the plot only about half of the time. The plot, such as it exists, is about BO’s attempt to assassinate The Beast, a demonic villain with giant wings who has two katanas and hangs out with scantily clad women who he sometimes keeps in cages. </p>
<p id="bWdCcR">It isn’t really clear what The Beast did to earn the contract put on his head, but at one point, he stands between two women in bikinis and chants, “Dance, bitch. Dance, bitch” over and over again until the scene finally cuts and BO’s narration says, “There’s magic in this brutality.” I can’t say what that means for sure, but I can say that Korine seems to believe it’s true, and also that it’s exactly in keeping with the tone of the rest of the movie. More than once we see several uninterrupted seconds of The Beast pelvic thrusting while holding his sword and yelling, only for BO to cut in with narration telling us how terrifying The Beats is.</p>

</p>
<p id="hGKnuc">BO rolls around southern Florida buying sniper rifles, telling the audience to be careful of strippers because if you stare into their eyes for too long, you’ll lose your soul, and meeting with other assassins, including Travis Scott’s character, Zion, who BO seems to take under his wing. But after every brief trip, BO always returns to his home base, where his wife has been waiting in bed for him, while her voice over talks about how much she misses him and wants to have sex with him. </p>
<p id="FuOYFy">What makes all this fascinating, though, is <em>AGGRO DR1FT </em>is accidentally a more insightful look at an incel’s fantasies than most of the movies that actually attempt to portray incel life. </p>
<p id="uJNf09">BO is a bit of a schlub, but he has a cool, sexy job, a cool, sexy wife, and a family he loves very much, and would do anything to protect. He also sees evil everywhere in a cruel and horrible world. It just happens to look like a demon in a mask, holding samurai swords. His wife is perfect and must be protected, but strippers are evil sirens who exist to steal men’s souls. </p>
<p id="EGaaHX">All this performative hyper-masculinity feels like it’s been filtered through the lens of a 14-year-old boy screaming on Xbox Live over a game of <em>Modern Warfare 2</em>. Evil is something you vanquish with a special sniper rifle, and women are made to be protected, not spoken to. The movie doesn’t create a coherent ideology, but it’s clear BO’s worldview is inherently self-righteous, and the world of the movie contorts itself around justifying him. </p>
<p id="0qalyd">What’s unique about <em>AGGRO DR1FT</em> is seeing all of this presented so brazenly, and without the defense of irony or sarcasm to dress it up. Like most of the movie, though, it’s fascinating to think about, but an absolute slog to actually watch.</p>
<p id="tiyqGF">The most uncomplicatedly interesting thing about <em>AGGRO DR1FT</em>, though, is the way it looks: Shot entirely with an infrared camera, with morphing neon colors that are often inverted, moving characters from bright featureless red to bright featureless blue, the movie looks unique. These aren’t entirely successful choices — the movie often just looks like an ugly mess of colors. But it’s a style that a different, more carefully conceived and directed movie could use well. The blocky neon vagueness of the bright colors often used in infrared photography also grants space to the movie’s best and most interesting feature: shifting illustrations that show up inside of the colors. </p>

<p id="YcCGiK">When a character or space (like the sky, for instance) slips all the way into a deep red hue, ink-like illustrations start to appear inside of the color, creating demonic heads, intricate machine parts, or presumably any other design Scott or Korine thought looked neat. These moments sometimes mean things, like when a massive demon-monster appears as BO commits a particularly nasty bit of violence, which seems to reflect his own self-image. Though these illustrations pop up constantly throughout the movie, especially in the second half, they feel criminally underthought, and like a disappointing waste of a great stylistic choice.  </p>
<p id="fJ2jqz">Reading all this, it might be tempting assume that, in spite of its flaws, <em>AGGRO DR1FT</em> is at least entertaining or exciting. I cannot stress enough that it is not. For all the movie’s talk about demons and assassinations, most of the movie’s nearly 90-minute runtime is taken up by characters driving from place to place, awkwardly standing around, or walking around southern Florida. </p>
<p id="mndGai">Writing a review of <em>AGGRO DR1FT</em> is already letting Korine win. It’s defiantly non-traditional and deliberately provocative. I can’t say that the movie really made me mad, but I can say I’m happy to let Harmony Korine win. He’s earned it;<em> AGGRO DR1FT</em> is an obtuse, ridiculous, headache-inducing movie to watch. It’s nearly impossible to tell whether any moment of the movie is entirely a joke or entirely sincere — it’s called <em>AGGRO DR1FT</em>, for God’s sake. It’s a meaningless phrase, rendered in all capital letters with a 1 standing in for an I; for all we know, it might as well be Travis Scott’s Gamertag. But the movie is more than that too. It’s as clear a depiction of a certain kind of distinctly male-coded interior life as I’ve ever seen, and there is value to making that in such a weirdly unfiltered way. <em>AGGRO DR1FT</em> isn’t an enjoyable or particularly well-made movie, but it is the movie I’ve thought about most this year. For better or worse, that’s worth something. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/persona-6-everything-we-know-so-far<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>With <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/persona-3-reload-review">Persona 3 Reload</a> officially in the rearview mirror, our next major slice of Persona-branded high school student simulation and turn-based dungeon battles will come via a presumed Persona 6. But when exactly will we see this next Persona game? And what will it be?</p><p>In truth, we know very, very little right now, but that doesn't mean we can't take a look at some early rumours and comments from the teams over at Atlus regarding Persona's next mainline entry. So, let's run through all the brief bits of information we've learned so far about what's next for the series.</p><h2>Persona 6 Isn't Confirmed Just Yet, but Atlus Wants to Make a New Entry</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/01/30/persona3reloadalt2-review-blogroll-1706584896935.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>Although Atlus hasn't come out and officially confirmed that Persona 6 is on its way, the team has gone on record to confirm that there will be future additions to the franchise. Back in 2018, the Persona studio's chief director, Kazuhisa Wada, told Dengeki Playstation (later translated by <a href="https://personacentral.com/kazuhisa-wada-interview-excerpts-on-persona-series-developments/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Persona Central</a>) that it was working on "mid-to-long term plans, including new numbered entries."</p><p>Since then, the company has alluded to the release of a new mainline entry several times, whether that's through job postings or hints that the company is working on something new. Although even without Atlus continuing to make clear that a sequel is in the works, it feels somewhat inevitable. <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/persona-5-series-passes-10-million-units-sold-after-tactica-launch">Persona 5's sales recently crossed 10 million units</a> and <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/persona-3-reload-becomes-fastest-selling-game-in-atlus-history-with-1-million-sales">Persona 3 Reload became the fastest-selling game in Atlus' history this year</a>, amassing a million copies sold in just one week. With recent entries pulling in record profits, it's hard to imagine Persona 6 isn't in the studio's future.</p><h2>Persona 6 Doesn't Have a Release Date, But Leaks Suggest It Could Come in the Next Few Years</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2022/06/27/persona5-1656362448085.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>Considering we don't have an official reveal of Persona 6 just yet, there's very little to go off regarding how far along it is and when it will hit shelves. That being said, one prominent leak seems to imply we can expect the game in the next two years. <a href="https://twitter.com/MbKKssTBhz5" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Midori</a>, A reputable insider who has shared multiple leaks pertaining to Atlus, SEGA and the Persona franchise in the past, shared on X that they'd <a href="https://twitter.com/MbKKssTBhz5/status/1699205462766326233" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">heard the game will either launch in 2025 or 2026</a>. They went on to claim that 2026 seems the most likely candidate, especially as the series' 30th anniversary falls within the same year.</p><p>As with any leak, it's worth taking the release window with a grain of salt until Atlus officially confirms anything, however, Midori has been a reliable source of information when it comes to early Persona news in the past. Considering Atlus has been rapidly releasing Persona content as of late, with Persona 5 Tactica, Persona 3 Reload and Persona 5: The Phantom X's China-exclusive open beta all launching in the space of a year, the studio seems to be ramping up its output of Persona titles, so a new mainline release in the next few years feels pretty fitting.</p><h2>There's a Very Good Chance Persona 6 Won't Be PlayStation Exclusive</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2023/12/08/metaphorthumb-1701998361881.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>Without an official Persona 6 reveal from Atlus, we don't currently have any firm information about the platforms the sequel will release on, but a major change in Atlus' attitude towards exclusivity could likely mean the next mainline release is the first to debut on multiple systems. </p><p>In the past, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/persona-games-in-order">every mainline Persona game</a> has debuted exclusively on PlayStation. However, Atlus' focus on Sony's systems has changed significantly in the past few years. Following the studio's decision to release Persona 3 Portable, Persona 4 Golden and Persona 5 Royal on PC, Xbox and Switch, it has trended towards releasing its major, tentpole titles on as many platforms as possible.</p><p>Persona 3 Reload was not only available on PS5, Xbox and PC when it hit shelves, but was added to Xbox Game Pass at launch. Meanwhile, the team's next major release, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/metaphor-refantazio-playstation-steam">Metaphor ReFantazio, is slated to hit all major platforms bar the Switch this fall</a>. With the team catering to a wider audience when releasing its biggest games, it seems Persona 6 could well be the first mainline entry to debut across a range of different platforms.</p><h2>Atlus's Goal is to Have Persona 6 "Exceed" Persona 5</h2><a href="https://assets1.ignimgs.com/2015/05/01/persona7jpg-a6e80f.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>Although Persona has always had a large, loyal fanbase, Persona 5 was the game that launched the series into the stratosphere. From glowing reviews to millions of sales, it was a huge hit and is still considered one of the best RPGs of the modern era. However, Atlus is aiming to outdo it in their next game, and has even brought on a bigger team to ensure they do.</p><p>As spotted and translated by <a href="https://personacentral.com/atlus-discusses-desire-to-grow-within-the-industry-persona-6-needing-to-surpass-persona-5/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Persona Central</a>, Atlus posted a job recruitment page back in 2017. Alongside listings for different roles within the company were interviews with staff at Atlus, including the studio's director: Naoto Hiraoka. In his interview, he claimed the team's goal was to "create a [Persona] 6 which exceeds [Persona] 5," and that the recruitment drive was imperative because "exceeding 5 will be difficult with the current staff." Considering Persona 5 was the team's biggest and most ambitious game yet, it'll be interesting to see what Atlus does to up the ante in the sequel.</p><h2>The Game's Colour Scheme Will Allegedly Be Green</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/04/08/persona-1712577088693.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>One of the major calling cards of a Persona game is its bold, attention-grabbing art style. Each game has its own take on the Persona aesthetic, usually themed around a specific colour. Persona 3 heavily featured a gothic blue, Persona 4 went for a more uplifting yellow and Persona 5 bathed itself in a chaotic red. For Persona 6, it seems <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/persona-3-4-and-5-were-blue-yellow-and-red-and-persona-6-will-seemingly-be-green">the developers are aiming to add a splash of green to the franchise</a>.</p><p>Once again taking a look at Atlus leaker <a href="https://twitter.com/MbKKssTBhz5" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Midori</a>'s recent tweets, they claimed in April that <a href="https://twitter.com/MbKKssTBhz5/status/1777240240824197390?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">"The color theme for Persona 6 is green."</a> Interestingly, the leak adds fuel to the fire of a long-running fan theory that started after Atlus posted some artwork for the series' 25th anniversary event. The image showed a lineup of all the lead characters throughout the franchise's six mainline games. Next to Joker from Persona 5, you can see a bucket filled with green paint.</p><p>Ever since the image dropped, fans were convinced the bucket confirmed that the next game would feature a green color-scheme, and if Midori's claims are true, it seems the theories were correct all along.</p><p><em>Callum Williams is a  freelance media writer with years of experience as a game critic, news reporter, guides writer and features writer.</em></p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

Many fans of Nolan’s work believe that, despite  his other critically acclaimed films and recent Oscar for Oppenheimer, Inception is quite possibly his masterpiece. With a stellar cast and an air-tight, intellectual plot, the indelible visual effects are just the cherry on top for this gem of a film. As with most Nolan films, there are many plot twists and turns throughout this one-of-a-kind cinematic experience, which is what fans are likely searching for more of in this list. </p><p>As fans continuously debate the true meaning of <em>that</em> final scene, we’re highlighting  some other movies like Inception that will keep you guessing no matter how many times you watch.</p><h2>Shutter Island (2010)</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/03/15/shutter-island-1710532711610.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>The closest selection to horror on the list, Shutter Island is a psychological thriller from Martin Scorcese that will surprise most viewers. Summoned to a remote island that houses an insane asylum, U.S. Marshall Teddy Daniels (Leonardo DiCaprio) must investigate the disappearance of a patient while attempting to fight off the demons that threaten to trap him in his insanity. Full of impressive performances and a nightmarish script from writer Laeta Kalogridis, Shutter Island is guaranteed to thrill.</p><p><em>Read our </em><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2010/02/19/shutter-island-review"><em>review of Shutter Island</em></a><em>.</em></p><h2>Memento (2000)</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/03/15/memento-1710540284337.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>Nolan’s Memento is the debut film that sparked his successful film career. Suffering from a rare, untreatable short-term memory loss condition, Leonard (Guy Pearce) attempts to track down his wife's murderer using limited clues and tattoos on his own body. Full of red herrings and a confusingly out-of-order plot, the viewer is placed directly in the shoes of our frustratingly confused protagonist.</p><p><em>Read our </em><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2001/03/30/review-of-memento"><em>review of Memento</em></a><em> or check out our list of the </em><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-thriller-movies"><em>best thriller movies</em></a><em> of all time.</em></p><h2>Get Out (2017)</h2><a href="https://assets1.ignimgs.com/thumbs/userUploaded/2017/2/22/url-1487805646530.jpeg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>Jordan Peele’s breakout directorial debut, Get Out is a genre-blending masterpiece built around mind-melding social commentary on race. Invited to a weekend getaway at his girlfriend's family's house, Chris (Daniel Kaluuya) grows suspicious of their overly welcoming nature. By maintaining an air of mystery and subversion throughout its skillfully crafted narrative,  Peele’s Get Out has been compared to the works of master filmmakers such as Hitchcock, Carpenter, and Kubrick.</p><p><em>Read our </em><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2017/02/23/get-out-review-2"><em>review of Get Out</em></a><em>.</em></p><h2>Source Code (2011)</h2><a href="https://assets2.ignimgs.com/2011/03/05/source-code-20110304064203609-3409174.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>Successfully blending elements of sci-fi, thriller, action, and romance, Source Code comes out of left field to deliver an unexpectedly sensational film.

Two rival magicians, set at odds by a previous partnership gone awry, compete to achieve the greatest illusion of all: teleportation.

<p data-characters="348" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">The year was 2015 and I was sitting on an uncomfortable futon in my living room at 3 am when I saw an advertisement for a free weekend of <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/tag/destiny-2/">Destiny</a></em>. With my curiosity piqued, I made a Titan, woke up in the Cosmodrome, and followed <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YTQp6loFEkM&amp;t=52s">Dinkle-bot</a> to the Last City. I unknowingly had found my favorite game and would spend nearly a decade playing it wrong.</p> <h2 id="h-the-cosmodrome" data-injectable="false">The Cosmodrome</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/destiny-2-the-cosmodrome-shuttles.jpg"></a><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="322" data-current-count="622" data-injectable="true">By the time I got into <em>Destiny</em>, both <em>The Dark Below</em> and <em>House of Wolves</em> expansions had been released, and Bungie was prepping for the release of <em>The Taken King</em>. It was the prime time for someone to be introduced, gorge themselves on the story, and then seamlessly dive into one of the greatest expansions in the franchise.</p>
 <p data-characters="280" data-current-count="280" data-injectable="false">This is where I got the notion that <em>Destiny</em> was a story-driven game with an incredibly strong core gameplay loop. Everything I did was guided by the narrative, from escaping the Fallen in the Cosmodrome to stealing Eris Morn’s ship and infiltrating Oryx’s Dreadnaught.</p> <p data-characters="279" data-current-count="559" data-injectable="true">Sure, there were Strikes, but those were story snippets for me. Since weapons were leveled up to unlock additional perks from columns, there wasn’t much, if any, of a loot chase in my mind. It wasn’t even until the <em>Rise of Iron</em> expansion that I even got into raiding.</p>
 <p data-characters="283" data-current-count="283" data-injectable="false">This trend continued with the release of <em>Destiny 2</em> in 2017 up until the release of <em>The Witch Queen</em> in 2022. No matter what you thought of their quality, Bungie regularly released expansions and Seasons. However, after two years of the drip-fed seasonal model, I was becoming starved.</p> <h2 id="h-neomuna" data-injectable="false">Neomuna</h2> <figure data-current-count="583" data-injectable="true"><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/destiny-2-neomuna-skyline.jpg"></a><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="273" data-current-count="273" data-injectable="false">The Seasons leading up to <em>Lightfall</em> were turbulent as I began recognizing that activities and their mechanics were essentially being reused. With the story being reduced to meager weekly updates, I was only logging in at reset to experience a 30-minute or less story beat. </p> <p data-characters="298" data-current-count="571" data-injectable="true">Despite this, Bungie had the hype machine working at full steam, and I was optimistic. <em>The Witch Queen</em> was an amazing expansion, and I was fully expecting Bungie to deliver with <em>Lightfall</em>. After all, the studio was surely skimping with seasonal content in favor of more resources for the expansion.</p>
 <p data-characters="355" data-current-count="355" data-injectable="false">This wasn’t the case. I wasn’t kind in <a href="https://progameguides.com/destiny/destiny-2-lightfall-review-the-light-has-abandoned-us/">my own review of <em>Lightfall</em></a> and my overall interest sharply declined. As the Seasons came and went, my play time came to a standstill as it felt like Bungie was just phoning it in at this point. Additionally, rumors had begun swirling that the developer had been poaching the <em>Destiny 2</em> staff for <em>Marathon</em>.</p> <p data-characters="435" data-current-count="790" data-injectable="true">Then came the <a href="https://progameguides.com/destiny/a-full-recap-of-the-bungie-layoff-situation-and-what-it-means-for-players/">October 2023 layoffs</a>. Without warning, Bungie laid off roughly 8% of its staff. While that is the worst part of that story, additional information surfaced suggesting those aforementioned rumors were accurate. Bungie leadership was bleeding <em>Destiny 2</em> dry and doing the bare minimum to keep it generating revenue so that money could be redirected to the development of <em>Marathon</em>. All of my worst fears had been proven true.</p>
 <p data-characters="261" data-current-count="261" data-injectable="false">It was a betrayal on every level, and while I had suspicions that Bungie was cheating on me as a player, it hurt all the more to get that confirmation. I had my doubts before, but now I was confident that my beloved decade-long saga was going to crash and burn.</p> <h2 id="h-the-tower" data-injectable="false">The Tower</h2> <figure data-current-count="561" data-injectable="true"><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/destiny-2-tower-titan-ramen-shop.jpg"></a><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="394" data-current-count="394" data-injectable="false">Outside of work obligations, I was done with <em>Destiny 2</em>. I had no faith the story would be brought to any meaningful conclusion. It was depressing and this continued for months until I hit a breaking point. Remembering the days when I would come home exhausted from work and finding solace in exploring Mars and Venus, I set aside my feelings regarding Bungie leadership and booted up <em>Destiny 2</em>.</p> <p data-characters="313" data-current-count="707" data-injectable="true">I like having a checklist of things to do in a game. Completing a Triumph releases the good chemicals in my brain, and chasing something like a Title is an easy recipe for that tasty dopamine. So, that’s what I did. I started with the most recent Season and began knocking out the Triumphs for the Titles. </p>
 <p data-characters="411" data-current-count="411" data-injectable="true">This led me down a rabbit hole of content whose surface I had barely scratched. I began paying attention to rolls with the hopes of either bolstering a loadout or finding something to build a new one around. I was now toying with Exotics that had never left my Vault prior. Old content became fresh as I was tackling it not only with new loadouts, but different builds on classes I hadn’t touched in ages.</p>
 <p data-characters="385" data-current-count="385" data-injectable="false">A whole new side of <em>Destiny 2</em> opened up as I was no longer shying away from higher-difficulty content. Instead, I was using it as a proving ground for my builds and refining them. This led to me connecting with different parts of the community and becoming more active overall. By no longer letting the story lead me, I saw the broader appeal of a robust gameplay loop full of options.</p> <p data-characters="484" data-current-count="869" data-injectable="false">At the time of this writing, <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/a-content-update-and-four-streams-completely-turned-the-destiny-2-community-around/">everything is looking bright for the future of <em>Destiny 2</em></a>. <em>Into the Light</em> is going strong and <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/new-trailer-for-destiny-2-the-final-shape-showcases-environments-inside-the-traveler/">what’s been shown of <em>The Final Shape</em></a> looks promising. Sure, this is all the result of Bungie breaking the “in case of emergency” glass, but I’ll take it. I have zero faith that the story will be brought to anything resembling a satisfying conclusion, but I’m not going to let that detract from things like an Onslaught Rat King run.</p>

From the first console with defining titles like <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/final-fantasy-vii">Final Fantasy VII</a> to the PlayStation 5 with smash hits like <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/god-of-war-ragnarok">God of War Ragnarok</a>, PlayStation is still today one of the key pillars in the games industry. Numerous consoles have been released over the last 29 years, with revisions, portable consoles, and new generations included. Below, we've compiled every single PlayStation console ever released. Take a stroll down memory lane and dive into the history of PlayStation!</p><p><em>Looking to save on a new PlayStation 5 or new titles for your system? Be sure to check out the </em><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-playstation-ps5-deals"><em>best PlayStation deals</em></a><em> available today.</em></p><h2>How Many PlayStation Consoles Have There Been?</h2><p>In total, <strong>fourteen PlayStation consoles</strong> have been released since the first PlayStation released in 1995 in North America. This list includes Slim revision models for consoles and the two portable consoles that Sony has released under the PlayStation branding. </p><h2>Every PlayStation Console in Order of Release</h2><h3>PlayStation - September 9, 1995</h3><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/05/17/playstation-1-1715925648913.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>The Sony PlayStation is the console that started it all. In a major departure from the industry leader Nintendo's cartridge-based approach, the PlayStation utilized CD-ROM. These discs had much more space on them, which led to major developers like Square Enix crafting games for the console. The PlayStation is forever remembered for titles like Metal Gear Solid, Final Fantasy VII, Resident Evil 2, Vagrant Story, Crash Bandicoot, and many more <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-ps1-games-playstation">great PS1 games</a>.</p><h3>PS One - September 19, 2000</h3><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/05/17/ps-one-1715925609306.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>PS One is a redesigned model of the PlayStation, offering the same features in a smaller form factor. The one major change with this model was the removal of the reset button. In 2002, Sony released an attachable screen for the PS One called the Combo. This was made possible due to the removal of a few miscellaneous ports on the back of the console. It's also worth noting that the PS One outsold the PlayStation 2 in 2000, which is wild looking back.</p><h3>PlayStation 2 - October 26, 2000</h3><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2023/09/27/playstation-2-1695822857065.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>PlayStation 2 took to the scene in October 2000 offering a massive increase in visual fidelity compared to its predecessor. Long gone were the days of polygon-shaped figures, and in were the days of detailed character models and 3D action titles. To this day, the PlayStation 2 is still <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-selling-video-game-consoles-nintendo-playstation-ps5-xbox">the best selling console of all time</a>.

First off, the disc drive was changed to be top-load, which fixed some issues players ran into with dual layer discs on the standard PlayStation 2 consoles. Additionally, Sony reduced the power draw for the PS2 Slim by reworking the internals to be more efficient. PS2 Slim was much smaller than the original PS2, hence the 'Slim' name. This was the first Slim revision by Sony, which has been utilized in every PlayStation generation since.</p><h3>PlayStation Portable - March 24, 2005</h3><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/05/17/playstation-portable-1715928720661.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-10-best-psp-games">PlayStation Portable</a> was the first portable console Sony ever released under the PlayStation name. Also referred to as the PSP (not to be confused with the new <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/playstation-portal-review">PlayStation Portal</a>), this console had capabilities of playing games, watching movies, and listening to music. It utilized UMDs as its method of physical storage for games and movies. The device was even capable of connecting to the PlayStation 2 and PlayStation 3 in some capacities, with certain titles allowing for the PSP to be utilized in-game. The <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-10-best-psp-games">best PSP games</a> of the time were also really solid entries in various franchises.</p><h3>PlayStation 3 - November 17, 2006</h3><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/05/17/ps3-fat-1715926934428.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-10-best-ps3-games-of-all-time">PlayStation 3</a> was a massive step up from the PS2, with all sorts of new capabilities. The major shakeup came with the new online features, specifically with PlayStation Network. PSN brought online multiplayer, digital downloads, and much more. This console was also backwards compatible, so PlayStation and PlayStation 2 titles could be inserted and played rather than just <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-10-best-ps3-games-of-all-time">PS3 games</a>. Lastly, PS3 introduced support for Blu-ray discs, which allowed players to insert movies and watch through their console. This addition is one of the reasons consoles have become some of the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-blu-ray-players">best Blu-ray players</a> on the market in 2024.</p><h3>PlayStation 3 Slim - September 1, 2009</h3><a href="https://assets1.ignimgs.com/2019/03/15/ps3-1552660016477.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>PlayStation 3 Slim arrived three years after the release of the original PS3, dropping over 33% of the weight, bulk, and power consumption of the original model. The cooling system was completely redesigned to save space, which also provided better thermals for the system. By far, the biggest departure of this release was the lack of backwards compatibility. Sony dropped support for PlayStation and PlayStation 2 titles in this model, and this is a feature that has never returned.</p><h3>PlayStation Vita - February 22, 2012</h3><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/05/17/playstation-vita-1715926692269.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/tech/playstation-vita">PlayStation Vita</a> marked Sony's first new entry in the portable gaming space in nearly seven years. A key draw for many was the ability to play hundreds of incredible titles across both the PS3 and the Vita. At the time of release, it was the most advanced portable system on the market, with dozens of features no other developer offered. Later in its life, Remote Play for PlayStation 4 was added, allowing players to stream PS4 games to the Vita anywhere in their homes.</p><h3>PlayStation 3 Super Slim - September 25, 2012</h3><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/05/17/ps3-slim-1715907474134.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>PlayStation 3 Super Slim was the final revision for PlayStation 3. Releasing just a year before PS4 hit the market, the PS3 Super Slim featured a top-load Blu-ray drive, better power efficiency, and an even slimmer design. Looking back on this release, the PlayStation 3 Super Slim ended up being the most durable PS3 that Sony released, which was largely due to the disc drive design and slimmer body. </p><h3>PlayStation 4 - November 15, 2013</h3><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2023/06/05/51roi4d4pul-sl1280-1686009312538.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/tech/playstation-4-1st-gen">PlayStation 4</a> offered internals that were over five times faster than PS3, allowing for a massive jump in visual quality for games. PS4 saw the release of incredible titles like Uncharted 4, God of War, Ghost of Tsushima, and many more. Another quality feature available on PlayStation 4 was the addition of a removable HDD, which allowed players to swap hard drives in and out for more storage. The <a href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/playstation-4/DualShock_4">DualShock 4 controller</a> was also a massive step up from the DualShock 3, offering a more ergonomic design to aid in comfort during long play sessions. The <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-ps4-games">best PS4 games</a> are still some of the best modern games you can play.</p><h3>PlayStation 4 Slim - September 15, 2016</h3><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/05/17/51t0bpwu8ul-1715906977543.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>In short, <a href="https://www.ign.com/tech/playstation-4-slim">PlayStation 4 Slim</a> was just a smaller and better version of the PlayStation 4. The PS4 Slim was much more power efficient than its predecessor, which allowed for the internals to be shrunk down into a smaller form factor design. While there was no difference in performance between this console and the standard PS4, the smaller design and quieter cooling system was a huge draw for many.</p><h3>PlayStation 4 Pro - November 10, 2016</h3><a href="https://assets1.ignimgs.com/2016/09/07/ps4700003jpg-5ebd03.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/games/playstation-4-pro">PlayStation 4 Pro</a> was a monumental step forward from the standard PlayStation 4. The console marked Sony's first entry into 4K support, with upscale technology utilized to create a 4K image. Combined with <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/what-is-hdr">HDR support</a>, the PS4 Pro finally allowed players to take advantage of their 4K displays. With twice the GPU power of PS4, this console was able to provide boosted frame rates for many titles. </p><h3>PlayStation 5 - November 12, 2020</h3><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/05/17/ps5-1715906405961.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/games/playstation-5">PlayStation 5</a> marked the most powerful PlayStation console to date, with support for <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/what-is-ray-tracing">ray tracing</a>, 120FPS, steady native 4K output, and more. By far, this is the largest PlayStation ever released, though it comes just under the PlayStation 3 in terms of weight. Alongside the console, the <a href="https://www.ign.com/tech/playstation-5-dualsense-controller">PlayStation DualSense Controller</a> brought loads of new features, including adaptive triggers, haptic feedback, and a USB-C charging port. Our list of the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-best-ps5-games">best PS5 games</a> dives into some of the greatest console titles to be released in this decade.</p><h3>PlayStation 5 Slim - November 10, 2023</h3><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2023/10/10/ps5-slim-1696956567005.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/tech/playstation-5-slim">PlayStation 5 Slim</a> brought new changes to the PlayStation 5 without drastically changing any of the hardware inside. First, the console is much smaller than the original PlayStation 5, which is a bulky console that can be challenging to fit in shelves. The major change with PS5 Slim is the modular design, which allows you to buy a console without a disc drive and buy the attachable drive separately later on.</p><h2>Upcoming PlayStation Consoles</h2><p>Although the PS5 Slim was released just last year, we are already expecting the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ps5-pro-everything-we-know">release of the PS5 Pro</a> at some point during the holiday season in 2024. As for the next generation of PlayStation consoles, we don't really have an exact date of when to expect them to arrive. Some speculation puts the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/playstation-6">release of the PS6</a> anywhere between 2026 and 2030.</p><p><em>Noah Hunter is a freelance writer and reviewer with a passion for games and technology.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/diablo-immortals-new-tempest-class-wields-wind-and-water-to-fun-effect<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Step aside, Mother Nature. There’s a new master of the environment in town.</h2></div><section><p>Diablo Immortal has had its ups and downs, just as its big brother Diablo IV has, but I have to admit the team working on Immortal has constantly been adding things that pique my interest. The Blood Knight was the first new class added to the Diablo franchise in nine years and it was an interesting spin on what I’d imagine a Castlevania protagonist would play like in the Diablo world. The Tempest is next and after playing for a while, I’m happy to report that the class adds an interesting set of new abilities and moves that make it a compelling option for players. I couldn’t tell if it would land in the S-tier category during my playtime, but it’s certainly got a lot of style that sets it apart from the others.</p><p>The Tempest’s main ability is focused on duplicating your character to set up an attack from all angles, as each clone (aka Zephyr) will mimic your attacks, which makes for some great gameplay moments that make you feel like a powerful trickster running laps around the demons on the map. The waterblades your character wields gave me God of War vibes for a moment, but in practice, the Tempest is a bit more like a trickster, zipping around the map and making it hard for enemies to get a bead on you.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div><h3>Diablo Immortal Tempest Release</h3></div></output><p>Using the power of wind and water, combined with your Zephyr’s, you’ll find that the initial Wave Edge and Mist-Touch combo will make great building blocks that help you get a feel for the playstyle. Some of the first skills like Squall and Crosswinds are wave and wind attacks that will propel you in a direction and spawn a Zephyr once cast. From there you can finish off that initial setup with an attack like Cascade which makes “you and your Zephyrs slam your edges into the ground, unleashing a crashing wave around you.”</p><p>In practice, with these abilities I found the early game had me quickly zipping around the map to spawn my Zephyrs before setting up this trap over and over again to take me through the first few missions. It was a lot of fun to figure out a good flow and watch enemies melt as you did so. Not only are the movements interesting, but the overall design style is something I really like. These dual dagger-wielding Tempests look sleek and stylish, with vibes from other games and classes in the mix. The Zephyr mechanic could be compared to a Necro minion build, but for the Tempest, the Zephyrs act on a cooldown as opposed to having a set health meter – meaning you’ll need to set them up with each encounter as opposed to simply having them follow you around. That said, on a late game build they provided us with the Samilian WIndbrush and a 5-Star Echoing Shade that added a 15% chance to "summon a shadow clone for 17 seconds that attacks nearby enemies with one of your Primary Attacks." This addition did give you closes that romed along side you for a short period of time. These touches mean it's definitely a class I could see myself having a lot of fun with. The Tempest has a short origin quest when starting out with the character too, giving you a bit more history about the Tempest origin. </p><p>The other notable part of this preview was the huge change to the Paragon system. Blizzard tells us that all progress made on the Paragons so far will be retained, and that the 15 Paragon trees have been reduced to five. The goal is to give more options to mix and match your skills and because your progress is retained it’ll be nice to keep building it out as you grind the endgame. The trees you could stat into now include Frenzy of Battle, Soul of Conquest, Grind Expedition, Invincibility, Stringed, and for the Tempest there was a Wind tree. Add the skills you want to use to your new skill tree and take them for a spin. I like this new system, as in the retail build it does feel like you get locked in a bit more, and now you can, at Paragon level 300, choose six skills to put into your build.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/05/17/ign-2024-05-09-station-12-00-03-21-25-still004-1715981627251.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>The new Paragon System in Diablo Immortal</figcaption></figure></output><p>The main criticism I have so far, strangely, is that Immortal feels incredibly easy. I know I’m the target audience, but progression has been ratched up so much that in the span of about an hour I had hit level 20 while everything around me melted. I realize that Blizzard wants to get you to endgame faster when rolling a 2nd or 3rd character instead of using the Class Swap option introduced a year after launch, but it doesn’t really give you a chance to learn by failing. You’re thrown so much loot and information a bit fast. Even trying out a Blood Knight at home after the event, I took him past level 30 by playing a mission here and there passively with minimum time put in. The ease of which takes away from the rewarding feeling you get when conquering something challenging.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The main criticism I have so far, strangely, is that Immortal feels incredibly easy.</p></div><p>All that said, when I asked about the health of the player base for Diablo Immortal, Blizzard told us that it “has been very healthy the whole time” during our interview. And because player counts saw a huge spike with the Blood Knight release, I’d imagine that we see one again with the Tempest. They also let us know that they’re already working on another character class addition and that they’d love to bring back characters they used to have as well</p><p>While I’ve had my criticisms about some of the mechanics Diablo Immortal uses, I do admit that I am impressed with the sheer amount of additions made to it in two years. There’s so much to dive into that it’s almost overwhelming when you sign back in. But because they’ve added two classes that are entirely new to the franchise, it’s worth trying them out for a few levels to see how they feel. I know I’ll be taking a peek in between my Diablo IV time when the Tempest and Paragon changes come to Immortal on May 23rd.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

He's best-known for streaming games like <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/grand-theft-auto-online">GTA Online</a>, though he has also sprinkled in Red Dead Redemption 2, Minecraft, and other games. </p><p>Neverthless, Cenat's stream has been a hit, bringing with it a seemingly endless stream of reactions and clips as he has his cursed his way through each difficult encounter.</p><blockquote data-theme="light">— d r e w (@its_nadaaa) <a href="https://twitter.com/its_nadaaa/status/1790156423038738592?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">May 13, 2024</a></blockquote> <p>Despite his inexperience, Cenat perservered, even managing to defeat the <a href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/elden-ring/Malenia,_Blade_of_Miquella_Location_and_Guide">notoriously difficult Malenia</a> on his 271st try following a struggle that lasted more than 20 hours.</p><p>After rolling credits, Cenat celebrated by watching the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/15-hidden-details-in-the-elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-trailer">trailer for the Shadow of Erdtree DLC</a>, which he roundly applauded, then he watched a speedrunner finish the game in less than two minutes, prompting one last furious reaction. </p><p>In all, Cenat's run lasted roughly 167 hours and took some 1,700 deaths to finalaly complete.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">After nearly 167 hours and over 1,700 deaths, Kai Cenat has officially beaten Elden Ring <a href="https://t.co/IQqb5JQGFC" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/IQqb5JQGFC</a></p>— Jake Lucky (@JakeSucky) <a href="https://twitter.com/JakeSucky/status/1791576240471884186?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">May 17, 2024</a></blockquote> <p>In his final review, Cenat thanked the Soulsborne community and called Elden Ring "a masterpiece." </p><p>"To the people who watch on the regular, thank you. Because y'all gave me a chance to explore a new game that is not in our category that we don't normally play and we had a great time...gaming is really huge and I really respect Elden Ring," Cenat said. </p><p>"[T]o the Souls community, y'all are some gamers. Second of all, this game is a masterpiece. Does it deserve game of the year? Yes. I love God of War. I love it. This game is cinema...I literally enjoyed every boss battle...I don't know what game compares to this now.

			<p>Xbox fans, and some of their employees, were blindsided earlier this month when <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-shuts-down-arkane-austin-tango-gameworks-and-a-couple-more-bethesda-softworks-studios/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Microsoft announced a number of their studios were being shuttered</a>, including the <a href="https://wccftech.com/deathloop-director-arkane-austin-closure-gut-stab-redfall-development-ceases/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">“gut stab” closure of Arkane Austin</a>, developer of the acclaimed Prey and the more troubled <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/redfall/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Redfall</a>. Following the announcement Arkane Austin was shutting up shop, it was reported that the <a href="https://wccftech.com/perfect-dark-in-very-rough-state-rumor-redfall-big-updates/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">team had been working on additional updates for Redfall</a>, including one that would deliver a long-promised offline mode. Unfortunately, at the time, it seemed unlikely any of these promised updates would come to fruition.</p>
<p>Well, thankfully, it seems there’s a glint of light amongst the darkness here, as it seems the Redfall team will indeed get to complete one last update, which will usher in that offline mode, single-player pausing, revamps to how enemies spawn, and more. Here’s what the <a href="https://x.com/playRedfall/status/1791491460858020040" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Redfall X account had to say on the matter</a>…</p>
<p><em>“Thank you for all your supportive messages. We are working to release our final update, Game Update 4, that brings revamped Neighborhood and Nest systems, Single Player Pausing, Offline Mode, and more. &nbsp;We’ll provide additional details soon. Thank you all.”</em></p>
<p>The shuttering of Arkane Austin is just part of wider change and turmoil going on at Xbox, which has <a href="https://wccftech.com/four-months-after-the-merger-with-activision-blizzard-microsoft-is-laying-off-1900-employees/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">included widespread layoffs</a>, the closure of other studios like Hi-Fi Rush developer Tango Gameworks, <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-flatlining-europe-publishers-questioning-support-ps5-ports/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">flatling Xbox Series sales</a>, and the <a href="https://wccftech.com/starfield-indiana-jones-not-going-multiplatform-4-older-xbox-titles-will/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">porting of some older games</a>, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-multiplatform-plans-playstation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">possibly even some top-of-the-line titles</a>, to other platforms. On the other hand, Microsoft now owns Call of Duty and it seems they’re <a href="https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-2024-coming-to-game-pass/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">planning to bring the blockbuster series to Game Pass</a>, so they’re far from out of the game. As for Arkane themselves, their main team in Lyon, France will continue onward as they're working on a <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/marvels-blade/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Blade game for Marvel</a>.</p>
<p>Redfall can be played on PC and Xbox Series X/S. There’s no official word on when the final update will arrive, but previous rumors stated it was being prepared to launch sometime in May.</p>

<p id="YTiIUY"><strong>Genre:</strong> Superhero action<br><strong>Run time: </strong>1h 54m<br><strong>Director: </strong>S.J. Clarkson<br><strong>Cast: </strong>Dakota Johnson, Sydney Sweeney, Isabela Merced</p>
<p id="bhlqkr">Sony’s latest entry in its <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24071940/madame-web-post-credits-sony-marvel-mcu-comics">Spidey-less Spidey Universe</a> stars Dakota Johnson as Cassie Webb, a paramedic living in Manhattan who gains the ability to see visions of the future after a near-death experience. When a mysterious superpowered stranger (who was with Cassie’s mom when she was <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23964014/madame-web-ezekiel-marvel-in-the-amazon-with-my-mom">in the Amazon researching spiders right before she died</a>) begins hunting a trio of young girls, Cassie takes it upon herself to protect them.</p>
<p id="0lsZkj">From our <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/24071362/madame-web-review-post-credits-scene-sequel-teaser-bad">review</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p id="qJDKn2"><em>Madame Web</em> might be the most shameless superhero movie of all time. Far from just the cash-in that it <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23962097/madame-web-movie-trailer-spider-man">seemed like a few years ago</a> when this movie headlined by an F-tier superhero was first announced, Sony’s latest Marvel offshoot is a two-hour post-credits scene, made only intermittently tolerable by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XX_Rxvg8vdo">Dakota Johnson’s underappreciated knack for comedy</a>.</p></blockquote>

<p id="mDw1V3"><strong>Genre: </strong>Dystopian action<br><strong>Run time: </strong>2h 37m<br><strong>Director:</strong> Francis Lawrence<br><strong>Cast: </strong>Tom Blyth, Rachel Zegler, Peter Dinklage</p>
<p id="64kMuC">Francis Lawrence returns to the world of The Hunger Games to tell the story of the early years of Coriolanus Snow (Tom Blyth), who would go on to become the president of Panem and the nemesis of Katniss Everdeen.</p>
<p id="Cfw1Cc">Set 60 years before the events of the first film, <em>The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds &amp; Snakes</em> recalls the fateful meeting between Coriolanus and Lucy Gray Baird (Rachel Zegler), a tribute from District 12 who would leave a profound impact on his life and worldview.</p>
<p id="3dMDbl">From our <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/23952899/hunger-games-ballad-songbirds-snakes-review">review</a>,</p>
<blockquote><p id="3zPjB6">Collins’ book and Lawrence’s movie don’t redo the action of the Hunger Games events; they dissect them, then force us to sit on the Capitol side of the equation. They demand to know why we were even drawn to the love triangle, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S2sXXG3tTaI">the pretty dresses</a>, and the themed arenas in the first place. We’ve always been the spectators, after all, watching Katniss’ story from a safe distance. <em>The Ballad of Songbirds &amp; Snakes </em>shows us what happens if we get too carried away by propaganda, luxury, and the promise of safety. In that way, it’s a fitting end to the franchise — and a fitting end to the way the genre evolved into a beast of its own.</p></blockquote>

<p id="ZbSuUQ"><strong>Genre:</strong> Sports drama<br><strong>Run time: </strong>2h 11m<br><strong>Director: </strong>Luca Guadagnino<br><strong>Cast: </strong>Zendaya, Josh O’Connor, Mike Faist</p>
<p id="J7i5tZ">Luca Guadagnino’s sensual sports drama, about a love triangle in professional tennis, has set certain circles of the world on fire since its release in late April and is <a href="https://www.polygon.com/what-to-watch/24064917/best-movies-2024">one of the best movies of the year</a>. Now, you can enjoy it at home.</p>
<p id="VqxjVF">From our <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/24127886/challengers-review-zendaya-luca-guadagnino">review</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p id="BJ2hPN">That script is a terrific three-course meal for Faist and O’Connor. They get to trade off face and heel roles from scene to scene and era to era, as Art and Patrick help and hurt each other in equal measure. But it’s an absolute smorgasbord for Zendaya, who <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24091605/dune-2-zendaya-movie-star-best-performance">even in starring roles</a> has <a href="https://www.polygon.com/22268795/malcolm-marie-review-netflix">never been given this much room</a> to stretch. Tashi is a gratifyingly rich character, both righteously angry over the thwarting of her ambitions and cruelly angry at all the men who have the nerve to keep on playing the game that was taken away from her. She’s hungry for affection and withholding it at the same time, by turns sensually curious and coldly dispassionate, ambitious and exhausted, conflicted and confident. She’s the kind of character that media master’s theses are made of, and unpicking Tashi’s conflicting motives and how she integrates them is likely to become a pop culture obsession in the months to come.</p></blockquote>

<p id="XO70Mz"><strong>Genre:</strong> Monster action<br><strong>Run time: </strong>1h 55m<br><strong>Director:</strong> Adam Wingard<br><strong>Cast:</strong> Godzilla, Kong, Rebecca Hall</p>
<p id="ARjsIF">The boys are back in town — the boys being Godzilla and Kong, of course. <em>Godzilla vs. Kong </em>director Adam Wingard returns for this team-up movie, where the big lads must work together to stop an invasion from Hollow Earth.</p>
<p id="lAzoOV">From our <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/24114548/godzilla-x-kong-the-new-empire-review">review</a>: </p>
<blockquote><p id="6wqRzU"><em>Godzilla x Kong</em> (yes, it’s styled like that, like a streetwear collab) is beyond “good” or “bad” or “movies.” It’s an arena show, a pro wrestler shouting in the squared circle, thumping their chest and raising the jumbotron hype meter before doing their signature move. Through brutally efficient pacing that minimizes what the script doesn’t care about (people, mostly) and maximizes what it does (giant monsters doing wrestling moves), it constantly eschews connection in favor of escalation. It’s an achievement in absurd spectacle, a comically silly way to spend $135 million. I hope Warner Bros. keeps burning money this way.</p></blockquote>

The plan is to launch a new permanent logo in the future alongside update 1.6. As pointed out by the outlet, Delta’s old icon most closely resembled Adobe’s Cloud Experience app icon. Since the ‘80s, most of Adobe’s logos and branding have included a stylized A featuring a gap, a design that does look similar to Delta’s old, now-defunct icon. </p><p>Hopefully, Delta’s next icon doesn’t share anything in common with some other giant and litigious corporation.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<!-- cache hit 1:single/related:5b6bb85477df652b6bb8d9bc4f030696 --><!-- empty -->
<p>Apple’s initial pitch for the tvOS and the Apple TV as it currently exists <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/09/tvos-17s-extra-column-of-icons-is-its-most-useful-new-feature-in-years/">was centered around apps</a>. No longer a mere streaming box, the Apple TV would also be a destination for general-purpose software and games, piggybacking off of the iPhone's vibrant app and game library.</p>
<p>That never really panned out, and the Apple TV is still mostly a box for streaming TV shows and movies. But the same App Store rule change that recently allowed <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/delta-game-emulator/id1048524688">Delta</a>, <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/ppsspp-psp-emulator/id6496972903">PPSSPP</a>, and other retro console emulators onto the iPhone and iPad could also make the Apple TV appeal to people who want a small, efficient, no-fuss console emulator for their TVs.</p>

<p>So far, few of the emulators that have made it to the iPhone have been ported to the Apple TV. But earlier this week, the streaming box got an official port of RetroArch, the sprawling collection of emulators that <a href="https://www.retroarch.com/?page=platforms">runs on everything</a> from the PlayStation Portable to the Raspberry Pi. RetroArch could be sideloaded onto iOS and tvOS before this, but only using <a href="https://docs.libretro.com/guides/install-ios/">awkward workarounds</a> that took a lot more work and know-how than downloading an app from the App Store.</p>
<p>Downloading and using RetroArch on the Apple TV is a lot like using it on any other platform it supports, for better or worse. ROM files can be uploaded using a browser connected to the Apple TV's IP address or hostname, which will pop up the first time you launch the RetroArch app. From there, you're only really limited by the list of emulators that the Apple TV version of the app supports.</p>                                            
                                                        
<p>The main benefit of using the Apple TV hardware for emulation is that even older models have substantially better CPU and GPU performance than any Raspberry Pi; the first-gen Apple TV 4K and its Apple A10X chip date back to 2017 and still do better than a Pi 5 released in 2023. Even these older models should be more than fast enough to support advanced video filters, like <a href="https://docs.libretro.com/guides/runahead/">Run Ahead</a>, to reduce wireless controller latency and higher-than-native-resolution rendering to make 3D games look a bit more modern.</p>
<p>Beyond the hardware, tvOS is also a surprisingly capable gaming platform. Apple has done a good job adding and maintaining support for new Bluetooth gamepads in recent releases, and even Nintendo's official Switch Online controllers for the NES, SNES, and N64 are <a href="https://www.macstories.net/news/apple-adds-nintendo-online-classic-controller-support-to-the-iphone-ipad-mac-and-apple-tv/">all officially supported</a> as of late 2022. Apple may have added this gamepad support primarily to help support <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/story/id1490288609?ign-itscg=20201&amp;ign-itsct=acd-sem-153300447325-683554519918&amp;mttnagencyid=c1a&amp;mttncc=US&amp;mttnpid=Google%20AdWords&amp;mttnsiteid=47267711&amp;mttnsubad=acd-sem-153300447325-683554519918&amp;mttnsubkw=kwd-349709206040&amp;mttnsubplmnt=c_adext%3A">its Apple Arcade service</a>, but all of those gamepads work equally well with RetroArch.</p>
<p>At the risk of stating the obvious, another upside of using the Apple TV for retro gaming is that you can also still use it as a modern 4K video streaming box when you're finished playing your games. It has well-supported apps from just about every streaming provider, and it supports all the DRM that these providers insist on when you're trying to stream high-quality 4K video with modern codecs. Most Pi gaming distributions <a href="https://kodi.tv/download/raspberry-pi/">offer the Kodi streaming software</a>, but it's frankly outside the scope of this article to talk about the long list of caveats and add-ons you'd need to use to attempt using the same streaming services the Apple TV can access.</p>                                            
                                                        
<p>Obviously, there are trade-offs. Pis have been running retro games for a decade, and the Apple TV is just starting to be able to do it now. Even with the loosened App Store restrictions, Apple still has other emulation limitations relative to a Raspberry Pi or a PC.</p>

<p>The biggest one is that emulators on Apple's platforms <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/04/why-a-gamecube-wii-emulator-may-not-be-possible-on-the-ios-app-store/">can’t use just-in-time (JIT) code compilation</a>, needed for 3D console emulators like Dolphin. These restrictions make the Apple TV a less-than-ideal option for emulating newer consoles—the Nintendo 64, Nintendo DS, Sony PlayStation, PlayStation Portable, and Sega Saturn are the newest consoles RetroArch supports on the Apple TV, cutting out newer things like the GameCube and Wii, Dreamcast, and PlayStation 2 that are all well within the capabilities of Apple's chips. Apple also insists nebulously that emulators must be for "retro" consoles rather than modern ones, which could limit the types of emulators that are available.</p>
<p>With respect to RetroArch specifically, there are other limitations. Though RetroArch describes itself as a front-end for emulators, its user interface is tricky to navigate, and cluttered with tons of overlapping settings that make it easy to break things if you don't know what you're doing. Most Raspberry Pi gaming distros use RetroArch, but with a front-end-for-a-front-end <a href="https://retropie.org.uk/docs/EmulationStation/">like EmulationStation</a> installed to make RetroArch a bit more accessible and easy to learn. A developer could release an app that included RetroArch plus a separate front-end, but Apple's sandboxing restrictions would likely prevent anyone from releasing an app that <em>just</em> served as a more user-friendly front-end for the RetroArch app.</p>
<p>Regardless, it's still pretty cool to be able to play retro games on an Apple TV's more advanced hardware. As more emulators make their way to the App Store, the Apple TV’s less-fussy software and the power of its hardware could make it a compelling alternative to a more effort-intensive Raspberry Pi setup.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/f1-24-qa-codemasters-talks-ai-improvements-confirms-nvidia-dlss-3-frame-gen-support/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>With two weeks left before the launch of <a href="https://wccftech.com/f1-24-features-dynamic-handling-the-series-most-comprehensive-physics-update-yet/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">F1 24</a>, the latest installment in the licensed Formula 1 racing game series, we have sent a few questions to Codemasters to discuss some of the new features and improvements that fans will find in the game. The answers were provided by Senior Creative Director Lee Mather and Senior Producer Simon Lumb.</p>
<p>As a reminder, F1 24 debuts on May 31 on PC, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series S|X. However, the Champions Edition ($20 more expensive than the Standard Edition) grants three days of early access, allowing owners to start playing on May 28.</p>
<p><iframe title="F1 24 Official Gameplay Deep Dive" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BWyNOpuzid8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p><strong>What was the community's reaction to the announcements? Will you address some of the feedback that has emerged in the launch version and afterward, and if so, which?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Lee:</strong> We’ve seen positive feedback to the F1 24 announcement and players have really engaged with the deep dive videos we’ve delivered. Players are really excited about the handling and physics updates alongside the new Driver Career. As always, we’ll be looking to log all player feedback once the game has launched. Players who have been part of our beta program have given feedback on stability, physics, handling, and AI, and we’ve already made adjustments based on this.</p>
<p><strong>What kind of tweaks and changes have been made to the AI?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Lee:</strong> With the significant changes in the physics and car setup in F1 24, the AI have also undergone a considerable amount of development to allow them to extract the best performance from the new model. This will be evident to the player in how they brake and exit corners and in the level of confidence they have when going wheel to wheel. The added stability of the cars this year impacts the ability of the AI to race cleanly in close proximity to the player.<br>
Another area of major change in F1 24 is in how the AI will manage the updated ERS system. ERS management will have a significant impact on how both the player and the AI attack and defend.</p>
<p><strong>What's your personal favorite new feature of F1 24?</strong></p>
<p>Lee: I can never answer this with just one thing because most of the features in this year’s game are complementary to one another. We have the fantastic new Driver Career, which represents the world of F1, giving players so many ways to fulfill their goal of becoming an F1 World Champion or taking a team to the top of the Constructors Championship. None of this would be possible without an amazing and immersive on-track experience. The core of any racing game is how the cars feel and race and, of course, how great they look. These are both areas of significant advancement in F1 24.</p>
<p><strong>Are there any improvements to the ray tracing features in F1 24?</strong></p>
<p>Simon: Yes, in F1 24, we have extended the Ray Traced Dynamic Diffuse Global Illumination solution. DDGI is a technique that better represents the light response in shaded areas. This gives us an extra dose of realism in terms of softer shadows, light response, and light bounce across such dramatic F1 locations as a bright (or rainy!) Monaco, the unmatchable light show of Las Vegas, or the lush forest of Spa Francochamps.</p>
<p><strong>NVIDIA's <a href="https://wccftech.com/ser-improves-ue5-lumens-hardware-rt-performance-says-nvidia/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Shader Execution Reordering</a>, a feature from RTX 40 GPUs that accelerates ray tracing performance, was supported at launch in F1 23 but did not work as intended and was subsequently removed. Will it be available in this new game?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Simon:</strong> Working with our partners at NVIDIA, we aim to give every user the best possible performance in F1 through our technology implementation. SER is a feature on their latest GPUs that helps with some specific ways that game engines work regarding Ray Tracing efficiency. When SER support was introduced in F1 23 at launch, we discovered that the technology did not provide enough benefit on the whole as EGO is already heavily optimized for the Ray Tracing workloads that SER was designed to improve in other engines. As there was no benefit for players, we removed the option from the UI. It remains off for F1 24.</p>
<p>What we have enabled in F1 24, which was not previously available in F1 23, is NVIDIA's Frame Generation performance solution. We hope that players with 40-series enjoy this upgrade for F1 24.</p>
<p><strong>Will there be any graphics updates (e.g., higher rendering solution, etc.) for the VR version of the game?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Simon:</strong> The VR solution will benefit from all of the new graphical updates added to the engine, with compatible hardware and a sufficiently powerful GPU.</p>
<p><strong>Will F1 24 support NVIDIA and AMD's frame generation techniques at launch?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Simon:</strong> F1 24 will support Frame Generation for NVIDIA GPUs.</p>
<p><strong>Will the game support triple screens/surround setups?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Simon:</strong> As has been the case in previous games, the game can be stretched across as many monitors as you have VRAM for. It is not currently perspective-correct, so in a 3-monitor setup, the side monitors look more stretched than the middle one. The UI is always rendered in a 16:9 aspect ratio, so in a 3-monitor setup, it will appear on the middle monitor only.</p>
<p>We are continuing to evaluate how we might better support such set ups and appreciate the enthusiasm from our players who want to get as close to the sport as possible.</p>
<p><strong>Are there any joystick support additions compared to last year?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Lee:</strong> We’ve added support for the Turtle Beach Velocity One. With the changes to the physics this year, players will really feel what the car is doing beneath them on both a force feedback wheel or controller with rumble and haptic feedback.</p>
<p><strong>Are there plans to ever bring back classic cars/tracks and integrate them in a more meaningful way?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Lee:</strong> We always have great fun with the classics and I’d never say never to them making a return at some point but there are no immediate plans for this. This year we’ve really focused on delivering an improved, expanded and deeper modern day F1 experience. Of course, the legends are all playable as part of the new Driver Career which is really fun, being able to play with such legends as your teammate opens up a whole new way to play Career.</p>
<p><strong>Will other racing series, such as Formula 3, ever be included in the future? Are there plans to bring back the paddock atmosphere from games like F1 2010, 2016, and 2017?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Lee:</strong> There are no immediate plans for this. We are currently hard at work and focusing on F1 24.</p>
<p><strong>You've mentioned that F1 24 is still powered by EGO Engine, which is bespoke and currently best for the game. However, your fellow Codemasters team from EA WRC <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-sports-wrc-tech-q-no-plans-to-add-lumen-or-nanite/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">switched to Unreal Engine</a>. Do you see yourselves considering the same option for next year?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Lee:</strong> The EGO engine which F1 is built upon is bespoke to F1. It’s what gives us our ability to move and change effectively, we are continuously adding new physics and rendering tech allowing us to keep the engine up to date and delivering the latest tech. The requirements of F1 and WRC are very different with WRC moving to Unreal to open up the opportunity to deliver a specific feature, that being long stages, which isn’t really a need for a track-based game like F1.</p>
<p>One of the key strengths of EGO is its ability to scale and deliver a high quality experience based on the hardware it’s being played on. While people might think it is the same engine, every year we adapt and grow EGO adjusting it to support what we want to achieve in the game that year.</p>
<p><strong>Thank you for your time.</strong></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24159200/twitch-shaking-butts-twerking-emotes-unbanned<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="RO52d7">Finally, all those little dumpy Crewmates from <a href="https://www.polygon.com/game/among-us/40702"><em>Among Us</em></a> can start shaking their asses on <a href="https://www.polygon.com/twitch">Twitch again</a>. CEO Dan Clancy announced changes to the platform’s Community Guidelines  on Wednesday, allowing cute animated emotes where characters shake their butts and twerk will be allowed on the platform. </p>
<p id="BETmn0">Emotes help cultivate lively and active viewers in Twitch. Oftentimes, spamming emotes and using channel-specific icons in the chat can be just as fun as consuming the content itself. Now, the team is changing the emote content rules so that they’re in line with the general Community Guidelines. This means: time to twerk. </p>
<p id="5l17XY">“So in particular emotes that feature shaking butts — commonly referred to as twerking but we’ll just call them shaking butts — are now permitted under our guidelines,” Clancy said on <a href="https://clips.twitch.tv/CheerfulExpensiveEmuRalpherZ-bGLmmLakcLJN5oER">Patch Notes livestream on Wednesday</a>. </p>
<p id="x7FYvO">The banned emotes were never particularly graphic to begin with and impacted a lot of simple cartoon drawings. Twitch users reported strict moderation in response to the emotes <a href="https://x.com/KaraCorvus/status/1412529590359117825">in the summer on 2021</a>. But now, those restrictions won’t apply. Polygon reached out to Twitch to ask about the change and a representative of the company replied with the following statement: </p>
<blockquote><p id="CNGnrg">We set out to clarify how emotes are evaluated for approval by our teams. Before today, the guidelines we used to evaluate emote requests differed from our Community Guidelines, in some ways. We realize that this may have caused confusion, as it wasn’t always clear how we made approval decisions. Now, we’ve brought our emote guidelines more in line with the rest of our Community Guidelines. We think this step will help to clarify our decision-making process for the community, something that’s important to us.</p></blockquote>
<p id="J58fvN">Twitch users have already embraced the change with open cheeks. Popular memes — like a GIF where a <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2020/9/21/21449498/among-us-fans-pretty-sus-meme-explained">Crewmate from <em>Among Us</em></a><em> </em><a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/among-us-twerk">shakes and bounces its butt</a> — will be able to make a return to Twitch chat. The ass-shaking has long been a popular format for emotes in general so artists have been responding by sharing art of various characters and other cute little drawings of characters shaking their butts. So if you’re a fan of cheeky art like of <a href="https://twitter.com/sweetxsage/status/1790832110334312598/photo/1">this voluptuous Kirby</a>, well ,you’re in luck, because now you might see plenty of it on Twitch. </p>

However, <em>Animal Well </em>also contains some standalone brainteasers that even a full set of tools can’t overcome. Take, for instance, the three-lever wave chart puzzle you’ll encounter in the bottom-right quadrant of the map. You’ll see a line on the wall alongside three dots, and you must use the levers beneath it to manipulate the shape of the line.<br></p><div data-video-id="196923" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Kotaku’s Hopes For Spyro The Dragon’s (Reported) Comeback" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="355" data-playlist="196923,196922,196918" data-current="196923"><div><p>Kotaku’s Hopes For Spyro The Dragon’s (Reported) Comeback</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196923/196923_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196923/196923_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196923/196923_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196923/196923_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/22494.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><p>As you might have guessed, you’ll solve this puzzle by adjusting the line so it passes through the three dots on the wall. Fortunately, you don’t have to get the line exactly through each dot; as long as you see each dot light up, it counts. <strong>The middle and right levers will manipulate the intensity of the line itself, while the left lever will wholesale move the line vertically</strong>.</p><p>The trick here is that you have to imagine what shape the line needs to be to hit all three lights at once. If, for example, you just try to pass through the first light, you may undo that work by the time you manipulate the line to hit the third light. Fortunately, <strong>you can adjust the levers to make the wave straightforwardly pass through the three lights in a gradual slope shape</strong>. Thinking of it that way may make the solution easier to visualize.<br></p><p>If you’re just sick of this puzzle and want the solution spelled out for you, check out the image below:<br></p><figure id="" data-id="1f892d570c0719e412e98e2644daeb2a" data-recommend-id="image://1f892d570c0719e412e98e2644daeb2a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1600" data-height="900" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Animal Well player character stands near three levers, with a line on the wall above them." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Animal Well player character stands near three levers, with a line on the wall above them." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Shared Memory / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="1f892d570c0719e412e98e2644daeb2a" data-recommend-id="image://1f892d570c0719e412e98e2644daeb2a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1600" data-height="900" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Animal Well player character stands near three levers, with a line on the wall above them." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Note the position of the levers at the bottom. You’ll want to position the left lever towards the bottom, and the middle lever should be tilted up. The right lever should be tilted slightly up, but remain relatively close to the center.</p><p>With the gate opened, you can open the treasure chest and obtain the Jade Egg.</p><h2 id="h203944"><a id=""></a>But what’s with that fish head on the right side of the room?</h2><p>Good question! If you’re still early in the game, you might be done here for now. However, if you find an item that blows bubbles, maybe the fish head will react in some way. Consider leaving yourself a reminder to check back here later on in your adventure.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>"Basically, fast-paced interesting ADHD gameplay. <span>Combination of <em>Dota 2</em>, <em>Team Fortress 2</em>, <em>Overwatch</em>, <em>Valorant</em>, <em>Smite</em>, <em>Orcs Must Die</em>."</span></p>
<p>That's how notable Valve leaker "Gabe Follower" <a href="https://x.com/gabefollower/status/1791115270905290793">describes</a> <em>Deadlock</em>, a Valve game that is seemingly in playtesting at the moment, for which a few screenshots have leaked out.</p>
<p>The game has been known as "<em><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/valve-register-mysterious-new-neon-prime-trademark-in-the-us">Neon Prime</a></em>" and "<em>Citadel</em>" at prior points. It's a "Competitive third-person hero-based shooter," with six-on-six battles across a map with four "lanes." That allows for some of the "Tower defense mechanics" <a href="https://x.com/gabefollower/status/1791110448114188557">mentioned</a> by Gabe Follower, along with "fast travel using floating rails, similar to <em>Bioshock Infinite</em>." The maps reference a "modern steampunk European city (little bit like <em>Half-Life</em>)," after "bad feedback" about a sci-fi theme pushed the development team toward fantasy.</p>
<div><blockquote data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Since testers started sharing Deadlock screenshots all over the place, here's ones I can verify, featuring one of the heroes called Grey Talon. <a href="https://t.co/KdZSRxObSz">pic.twitter.com/KdZSRxObSz</a></p>— ‎Gabe Follower (@gabefollower) <a href="https://twitter.com/gabefollower/status/1791311128422748285?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 17, 2024</a></blockquote></div>
<p>Valve doesn't release games often, and the games it does release are often in development for long periods. <em>Deadlock</em> purportedly started development in 2018, two years before&nbsp;<em>Half-Life: Alyx</em> existed. That the game has now seemingly reached a closed (though not closed enough) "alpha" playtesting phase, with players in the "hundreds," could suggest release within a reasonable time. Longtime Valve <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/01/what-to-make-of-valves-recent-fan-project-takedowns/2/">watcher</a> (and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2016/09/the-unreleased-half-life-multiplayer-mod-that-you-can-play-now/">modder</a>, and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/09/recent-valve-vr-update-contains-hidden-half-life-demo-code/">code examiner</a>) Tyler McVicker suggests <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k8MqhEz6N_k">in a related video</a> that <em>Deadlock</em> has hundreds of people playing in this closed test, and the release is "about to happen."</p>                                            
                                                        
<p>McVicker adds to the descriptor pile-on by noting that it's "team-based," "hero-based," "class-based," and "personality-driven." It's an attempt, he says, to "bring together all of their communities under one umbrella."</p>
<figure><p><iframe type="text/html" width="980" height="550" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/k8MqhEz6N_k?start=0&amp;wmode=transparent" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><figcaption><p>Tyler McVicker's discussion of the leaked <em>Deadlock</em> content, featuring ...&nbsp;<em>BioShock Infinite&nbsp;</em>footage.</p></figcaption></figure>
<p>Many of Valve's games do something notable to push gaming technology and culture forward. <em>Half-Life&nbsp;</em>brought advanced scripting, physics, and atmosphere to the "<em>Doom </em>clones" field and forever changed it. <em>Counter-Strike </em>and <em>Team Fortress 2</em> lead the way in team multiplayer dynamics. <em>Dota 2</em> solidified and popularized MOBAs, and <em>Half-Life: Alyx</em> gave VR on PC its killer app. Yes, there are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artifact_(video_game)"><em>Artifact</em></a> moments, but they're more exception than rule.</p>
<p>Following any of those games seems like a tall order, but Valve's track record speaks for itself. I think players like me, who never took to <em>Valorant </em>or <em>Overwatch</em> or the like, should reserve judgment until the game can be seen in its whole. I have to imagine that there's more to <em>Deadlock</em> than a pile of very familiar elements.</p>

<p data-characters="226" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">ARs are very well balanced at the moment in <em>Warzone</em>. There isn’t one particular weapon that is significantly better than other options, and several rifles are worth using in standard battle royale matches or Resurgence. </p> <p data-characters="423" data-current-count="423" data-injectable="true"><em>Warzone’s</em> long-range meta is usually dominated by LMGs because of their large magazine sizes and powerful damage output. Yet, in <em>Modern Warfare 3’s</em> iteration of <em>Warzone</em>, ARs tend to reign supreme as Resurgence has emerged as the more popular game mode, which has smaller maps that ARs perform better on thanks to their improved mobility. If you are a fan of ARs, here are the best options in Season 3 Reloaded. </p>
 <h2 data-injectable="false">Best AR loadouts in Warzone, ranked</h2> <h3 id="h-5-bal-27" data-injectable="false">5. BAL-27</h3> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"></figure> <ul data-found-items="5" data-current-count="500" data-injectable="true"> <li><strong>Muzzle:&nbsp;</strong>ZEHM35 Compensated Flash Hider</li> <li><strong>Barrel:&nbsp;</strong>Crown-H3 Barrel</li> <li><strong>Underbarrel:&nbsp;</strong>Bruen Heavy Support Grip</li> <li><strong>Magazine:&nbsp;</strong>60 Round Mag</li> <li><strong>Stock:&nbsp;</strong>Sandbard Heavy Stock</li> </ul>
 <p data-characters="586" data-current-count="586" data-injectable="true">Without attachments to help improve recoil, the BAL-27 will feel like it’s bouncing all over the place while firing and too inconsistent to reliably take out an enemy 30 meters away or further. We did our best to mask that deficiency, but this AR still, unfortunately, gets outclassed in that category by other options. With that being said, the&nbsp;<strong>Sandbar Heavy Stock&nbsp;</strong>greatly improves recoil control, gun kick, aiming idle sway, and firing stability. In addition, the&nbsp;<strong>Bruen Heavy Support Grip&nbsp;</strong>also checks off all of those boxes to make the AR shoot more predictably.</p>

 <p data-characters="308" data-current-count="308" data-injectable="false">Most <em>MW2</em> weapons haven’t quite found a place in <em>Warzone’s</em> meta this year, but the Kastov 545 is a surprisingly consistent weapon that deals enough damage to compete with other popular weapons. Our loadout focuses on improving overall recoil and performance in medium to long-range engagements. </p> <h3 data-injectable="false">3.SVA 545</h3> <figure data-current-count="608" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid </figcaption></figure>

Either way, this AR will shred through enemies and is extremely easy to use. This rifle’s time-to-kill speed doesn’t jump off the page, but the weapon never suffers from a massive drop-off at longer ranges and won’t have any issues going toe-to-toe to with any other top-tier option. </p>

 <p data-characters="313" data-current-count="313" data-injectable="false">Our loadout focuses on addressing all areas to round out the MTZ-556. The&nbsp;<strong>L4R Flash Hider</strong>, for example, improves recoil control and gun kick so the versatile AR can extend its range. Then, the&nbsp;<strong>MTZ VLDL-3568 Barrel</strong>&nbsp;improves ADS and sprint-to-fire speeds to make up for what’s lost from the barrel.</p> <p data-characters="461" data-current-count="774" data-injectable="true">Next, the&nbsp;<strong>Chewk Angled Grip</strong>&nbsp;hits a little bit of everything, improving aiming idle sway, aiming walking speed, and horizontal recoil. With these attachments equipped, this loadout should have no issue taking on opponents up to 30 meters away. Anything else will require the sniper rifle. Finally, a&nbsp;<strong>50-round drum</strong>&nbsp;makes it easier to take on multiple enemies simultaneously, while the&nbsp;<strong>MK.3 Reflector</strong>&nbsp;compensates for poor iron sights.</p>

 <p data-characters="423" data-current-count="423" data-injectable="false">The BP50 is the best AR in <em>Warzone</em> Season 3 Reloaded. According to <a href="https://www.truegamedata.com/#/home" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">TrueGameData</a>, the BP50 has the best TTK by a wide margin from 0-15 meters compared to other ARs, and remains fast for most medium range engagements. We don’t recommend using this weapon for any gunfight past 40 meters as there is a massive drop off in damage, but you won’t find a better option for short to mid-range gunfights in this class. </p>

This is according to leaks from playtesters posted on social media earlier today, with some of the details verified by known Valve dataminer @GabeFollower and Valve watcher Tyler McVicker. </p><p>“Since testers started sharing <em>Deadlock</em> screenshots all over the place, here’s ones I can verify, featuring one of the heroes called Grey Talon,” <a href="https://x.com/gabefollower/status/1791311128422748285">@GabeFollower posted on X</a>.</p><p>The post included four screenshots allegedly from the game, which features characters (one of which looks like the Sniper from <em>Team Fortress 2)</em> battling in a city map that seems reminiscent of <em>Half-Life 2’</em>s City 17. Another image shows a hero named Grey Talon and includes the character’s weapon and ability icons with a short description.</p><p><em>Deadlock</em> wasn’t a game Valve gave any indication was in the works, so its reveal is certainly surprising. Earlier this week, GabeFollower shared <a href="https://x.com/gabefollower/status/1791115270905290793">more information about <em>Deadlock</em> on their X page</a>, writing that the game is “fast-paced interesting ADHD gameplay. Combination of<em> Dota 2</em>, <em>Team Fortress 2</em>, <em>Overwatch</em>, <em>Valorant</em>, <em>Smite</em>, <em>Orcs Must Die</em>.” <em>The Verge</em> has reached out to Valve for comment.</p><p>Though Valve is now mostly known for its PC publishing platform Steam and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24152085/hades-2-steam-deck-performance">the Steam Deck</a>, the company is still making games. Last year, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/9/27/23893279/valve-counter-strike-2-launch">Valve released <em>Counter-Strike 2</em></a>, an update to the perennially popular <em>Counter-Strike GO.</em> Back in 2017, Valve president and co-founder Gabe Newell shared that the company was <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/2/10/14578652/valve-vr-games-announced-htc-vive-gabe-newell">working on three “<em>full</em>&nbsp;games” for VR</a>, with one of them being the 2020 hit <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/23/21188291/half-life-alyx-review-valve-index-oculus-quest-vr-shooter"><em>Half-Life: Alyx</em></a>. <em>Deadlock</em> doesn’t seem to be a VR title, so there might be even more secret Valve games looming on the horizon.</p><p><em><strong>Correction, May 17th: </strong>An earlier version of this story misattributed some of the info. Those portions came from GabeFollower, not Tyler McVicker.&nbsp;</em></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/new-claim-suggests-next-xbox-console-will-launch-in-2026/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>A new claim from a Call of Duty data miner suggests that the next Xbox console could launch as soon as 2026. The console would also feature that year’s Call of Duty as a launch title.</p>



<p>“Hearing from trusted sources that the next Xbox is planned to be released in late 2026,” <a href="https://x.com/TheGhostOfHope/status/1791524663807328666" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Ghost of Hope wrote</a>. “Very likely that COD2026 is a day one release for it.”</p>



<p>Call of Duty 2026 is being developed by Infinity Ward. It’s also worth noting that Ghost of Hope has sources within Activision, which could be where his information is coming from.</p>

</div></figure>



<p>Microsoft has gone on record multiple times in saying that a next-generation Xbox console would be coming. In an episode of the official Xbox podcast in February Xbox president Sarah Bond said that the company was exited about what’s coming with future Xbox hardware.</p>



<p>“We’re also invested in the next-generation roadmap,” she said. “What we’re really focused on there is delivering the largest technical leap you will have ever seen in a hardware generation, which makes it better for players and better for creators and the visions that they’re building.”</p>



<p>In April, according to an <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/exclusive-xbox-president-sarah-bond-has-set-up-a-new-team-dedicated-to-game-preservation-and-forward-compatibility" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">internal email</a>, she reiterated the company was “moving full speed ahead” on the next system.</p>



<p>As far as a timeline for a next-gen console goes, it was discovered as part of the case investigation Microsoft’s purchase of Activision that the belief was that next-gen consoles from both Microsoft and Sony <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-6-xbox-series-xxx/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wouldn’t be coming until 2028</a>. The document sourced in the case was from 2022.</p>



<p>In it’s most recent earnings, however, Microsoft says that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xboxrevenue-up-and-down/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Xbox hardware sales were down</a> 31% year over year. That could change the timeline for getting its next console out the door.</p>



<p>Aside from a next-gen system, a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/first-images-of-white-xbox-series-x-all-digital-leaked-online/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new white Xbox Series X</a> is expected to be released at some point.</p>



<p>It’s worth noting that nothing regarding the next generation Xbox console has been confirmed by Microsoft, and likely won’t be addressed. So, with any rumor like this that hasn’t been confirmed or independently verified by Insider Gaming, please take the claims with a grain of salt.</p>

            <p>
In news that should be of no surprise to anyone given Fortnite's all-consuming nature, post-apocalyptic RPG series Fallout will soon be making an appearance in the battle royale game.
</p>
<p>
Fallout is, of course, currently enjoying a bit of a renaissance thanks to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/amazons-fallout-tv-show-was-watched-by-65m-people-in-its-first-two-weeks">Amazon's recent live-action TV adaptation</a>, making it a prime target for the popularity vampire that is Fortnite.
</p>
<p>
Fortnite's impending Fallout collaboration was teased on its <a href="https://x.com/FortniteGame/status/1791499072789979575">official X account</a>, where a winky face and thumbs-up emoji (squint a bit and it could be Vault Boy) accompanied an image of someone in T-60 power armour staring pensively out of frame amid clouds of belching smoke.

<p>
A little more information was shared in Fortnite itself; as per a caption under the same image in-game, Fortnite's next season - officially titled Chapter 5 Season 3: Wrecked - is said to come "courtesy of the Brotherhood of Steel" when it begins on 24th May. At which point players can probably expect Fallout-themed skins, quests, and whatever else Epic can cook up as all involved look to capitalise on the Bethesda series' recent success.

<p>
Fallout's impending arrival in Fortnite will follow the battle royale game's recent collaborations with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/lego-fortnite-adds-big-new-star-wars-world-this-week">Star Wars</a> - to celebrate 4th May - and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/billie-eilish-coming-to-fortnite-adding-weight-to-a-much-discussed-leak">pop star Billie Eilish</a>. Entities less likely to appear in Fortnite in the coming months include the Netherlands' Authority for Consumers and Markets - which has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnite-to-appeal-11m-fine-over-unfair-commercial-practices-aimed-at-children">fined Epic €1.1m</a>, accusing it of "unfair commercial practices aimed at children" - and rap star Doja Cat, who <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rap-star-doja-cat-says-only-horrible-and-garbage-players-use-fortnites-most-over-powered-weapon">isn't particularly happy with Epic</a> thanks to Fortnite's Chains of Hades.

But the last version of the dungeon crawling board game, its fourth, was published way back in 2008, well before the modern board gaming Renaissance really began. Now <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23998290/hasbro-layoffs-before-christmas">Hasbro</a> is bringing it back for a fifth edition. Pre-orders, priced at $59.99, are live now. The game returns to mass market retail on July 1.</p>
<p id="H8wlLh">In <em>Talisman</em>, players take on the role of stock fantasy heroes on the quest for a MacGuffin called the Crown of Command. The highly linear board game takes players round and round a citadel, where they encounter traps and monsters, and even fight against the other players at the table. It’s an unusual hybrid of an action-oriented tabletop role-playing game and something like <em>Candyland</em>, but a novel format that has resonated with generations of casual fans of tabletop games.</p>
<p id="nfoVAo">Polygon reached out to Hasbro following Friday’s press release. They confirmed that the IP hasn’t changed hands. Instead, the game is being produced under license from Games Workshop. Here’s the official description:</p>
<blockquote><p id="7L4wFA">In the game, players set forth on an epic adventure, racing to be the first to obtain a Talisman, reach the Crown of Command in the center of the board, and defeat the elder dragon to win. With a diverse range of characters to choose from and a vast world of possible scenarios plus an easy to use, revised 5<sup>th</sup> Edition Rulebook, this strategy game offers limitless adventures!</p></blockquote>
<p id="3NG3x7">While the game retains the traditional spiral game board, new cover art was revealed showing a crumbling staircase leading to a glowing crown while giant statues of gilded heroes look on. Product photos also show plastic 12 plastic miniatures for each of the 12 included character classes. More information is promised in the weeks ahead. For now, all we have is the gallery of images below.</p>

One is Naoe, a ninja who will don the hood and hidden blade commonly associated with the titular Assassins of Ubisoft’s open-world action franchise.

Grab your hidden blades, it’s time to pit assassins against each other. </p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="426700d4ba1f3b3d2693317dc47066c0" data-recommend-id="image://426700d4ba1f3b3d2693317dc47066c0" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Altaïr draws his blade." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Altaïr draws his blade." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Ubisoft</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="426700d4ba1f3b3d2693317dc47066c0" data-recommend-id="image://426700d4ba1f3b3d2693317dc47066c0" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Altaïr draws his blade." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Altaïr, the protagonist of the first <em>Assassin’s Creed</em>,<em> </em>was the blueprint (derogatory) for how the franchise would portray its heroes. He was used to establish a format: a modern-day character uses the Animus, a virtual reality simulation, to view the memories of a historical ancestor. But in its first iteration, <em>Assassin’s Creed </em>seemed hesitant to make its hero more than an avatar for Desmond Miles, Altaïr’s modern-day descendant. He’s serviceable as a premise, but as a character? There’s probably a reason Ubisoft ditched him for Desmond’s far more popular ancestor, Ezio, in the sequel. — Kenneth Shepard</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="105628b0b5d87e3ced4d366839098b2d" data-recommend-id="image://105628b0b5d87e3ced4d366839098b2d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1483" data-height="834" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Arno points his blade." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Arno points his blade." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Ubisoft</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="105628b0b5d87e3ced4d366839098b2d" data-recommend-id="image://105628b0b5d87e3ced4d366839098b2d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1483" data-height="834" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Arno points his blade." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p> “Discount Ezio” is the easiest, if not the nicest, way to describe the protagonist of <em>Assassin’s Creed Unity.</em> It’s also accurate. Arno lost his father and was raised by a wealthy family, making his origin similar to Ezio’s. They both do some brooding, too. But while Ezio is a charming vagabond who oozes personality and zest, Arno is the exact opposite. He spends most of <em>Unity </em>moping around, sulking, and being annoying. His story also runs out of steam by the end, but nobody really cares (not even Ubisoft) because everyone understandably forgot about Arno and moved on. -Zack Zwiezen </p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="d054a11a563ad93a3da3e0543f5641cf" data-recommend-id="image://d054a11a563ad93a3da3e0543f5641cf" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Connor talks to someone." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Connor talks to someone." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Ubisoft</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="d054a11a563ad93a3da3e0543f5641cf" data-recommend-id="image://d054a11a563ad93a3da3e0543f5641cf" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Connor talks to someone." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Poor Connor Kenway, born Ratonhnhaké:ton, he deserved better. <em>Assassin’s Creed III </em>is a mess of a game and the biggest victim is Connor. The son of a Templar and a Native American woman, Connor struggles with his place in the world. While he ultimately ends up an Assassin, he often questions and criticizes the white leaders he’s forced to work alongside. It’s an intriguing setup.</p><p>But, sadly, Connor ends up acting more like a monotone broken record than a real character throughout the game’s main storyline. It doesn’t help that Ubisoft’s decision to make<em> ACIII </em>bigger than any previous game meant that Connor’s arc got covered in sidequests and busy work. -Zack Zwiezen</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="f46a95175a4ffa73322aaad96ef9bfb3" data-recommend-id="image://f46a95175a4ffa73322aaad96ef9bfb3" data-format="jpg" data-width="1535" data-height="857" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Aveline is perched on top of a building." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Aveline is perched on top of a building." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Ubisoft</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="f46a95175a4ffa73322aaad96ef9bfb3" data-recommend-id="image://f46a95175a4ffa73322aaad96ef9bfb3" data-format="jpg" data-width="1535" data-height="857" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Aveline is perched on top of a building." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>It’s a shame so few people played as Aveline de Grandpré when <em>Assassin’s Creed III: Liberation</em> launched on the Vita in 2012, because she’s an anomaly for the series even 12 years later. She was the first female protagonist in the series, and unlike future characters, she wasn’t a choice you could simply swap out, or sharing the spotlight with anyone else. <em>Liberation</em> follows her in the 1700s as the daughter of a freed slave who becomes inducted into the Assassin Brotherhood due to her attempts to free and protect slaves. The game makes great use of its period setting, and Aveline’s unique place in it, having her navigate different situations covertly by donning “personas” to blend in with different elements of New Orleans society.</p><p>Thankfully, more people have gotten a chance to play her story in the years since its release on Sony’s handheld, as <em>Liberation </em>has been remastered and ported to every system under the sun. Still, there’s something damning about her resurgence, as it calls attention to the fact that <em>Assassin’s Creed </em>has been hesitant to give a character like her sole presence in the spotlight since. — Kenneth Shepard</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="14056e645cc32b489562474d07463dd4" data-recommend-id="image://14056e645cc32b489562474d07463dd4" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Jacob stands in front of a clocktower" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Jacob stands in front of a clocktower" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Ubisoft</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="14056e645cc32b489562474d07463dd4" data-recommend-id="image://14056e645cc32b489562474d07463dd4" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Jacob stands in front of a clocktower" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>One half of the Frye twins who headline 2015’s <em>Assassin’s Creed Syndicate</em>, Jacob is a likable scoundrel who, frankly, is overshadowed by his even more charismatic and captivating sister. Jacob certainly has his moments of roguish charm, the ability to deploy a winning smile and defuse all the exasperation you were feeling toward him just a moment before. He’s also, at times, a rousing leader, as he attempts to organize the exploited poor of Victorian London and thwart their oppressors. However, Jacob can also come across as a real jerk sometimes, and the fact that <em>Syndicate</em> focuses more and more on him (and less on his sister) as it builds toward its climax feels like a miscalculation. Jacob is…fine, but if one of the Frye siblings had to be second fiddle, it should have been him.—Carolyn Petit</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="8857274a7522a04b5f8197b7064a1dc2" data-recommend-id="image://8857274a7522a04b5f8197b7064a1dc2" data-format="jpg" data-width="1101" data-height="620" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Cormac points his gun at something off-screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Cormac points his gun at something off-screen." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Ubisoft</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="8857274a7522a04b5f8197b7064a1dc2" data-recommend-id="image://8857274a7522a04b5f8197b7064a1dc2" data-format="jpg" data-width="1101" data-height="620" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Cormac points his gun at something off-screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Most <em>Assassin’s Creed</em> protagonists are heroes, more or less, but Shay Cormac is the big exception. As the star of<em> Assassin’s Creed: Rogue</em>, Shay lets us slide into the boots of someone who joins the Assassins and then leaves for the Templars after he loses faith in the Brotherhood’s motives and leaders.</p><p>What makes Shay such a compelling character is that Ubisoft does a good job of making him sympathetic, and his turn to the Templars seems reasonable. In a series that rarely puts a microscope on the Brotherhood, it’s refreshing to see Shay and his journey. Sure, maybe the Templars are worse, but <em>Rogue </em>and its star, Shay, make the case that the Assassins might not be as noble as the legends and its leaders suggest. -Zack Zwiezen</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="a23bbc8cb9f42302a6e062e131a4aae9" data-recommend-id="image://a23bbc8cb9f42302a6e062e131a4aae9" data-format="jpg" data-width="1919" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Eivor wields two axes." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Eivor wields two axes." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Ubisoft</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="a23bbc8cb9f42302a6e062e131a4aae9" data-recommend-id="image://a23bbc8cb9f42302a6e062e131a4aae9" data-format="jpg" data-width="1919" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Eivor wields two axes." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p><em>Assassin’s Creed: Valhalla</em>’s Viking protagonist has a fair bit of baggage. Eivor is one of the more malleable playable characters in the series, as <em>Valhalla </em>is pretty entrenched in the choice-driven RPG genre that <em>Assassin’s Creed </em>has shifted into of late. But Eivor is also one of the weirdest attempts at dealing with canon while giving the player some freedom to make the character their own. Because of <em>Assassin’s Creed</em>’s mix of mythology and science fiction, Eivor is an incarnation of Odin, the Norse god. But you can play as either a male or female version of Eivor…only to find out that the male version is just Odin’s DNA being projected through the Animus.</p><p>Ubisoft put this in as a solution to making a specific Eivor “canon,” because now no matter what you do, Eivor was a woman and her male counterpart is just her previous iteration’s DNA confusing the virtual reality technology. But all this late-game twist does is make you ask why <em>Assassin’s Creed </em>can’t have a sole woman as its lead. It even ends up complicating things like its slew of gay romantic relationships for a male Eivor, asserting that they were secretly heterosexual ones the whole time. <em>Valhalla</em>’s choice-driven structures invite the player to define who Eivor can be, only to pull the rug out from under them in the eleventh hour.</p><p>Pushing all the baggage away with all your might, Eivor is a very likable protagonist. She’s caring, loves her clan, and is, interestingly enough, pretty separate from the usual Assassins vs. Templars storyline. I appreciate some of the interesting narrative swings Ubisoft took with her, but Eivor ends up being a case study in how the modern-day framing of historical fiction is both an asset and a disadvantage to the <em>Assassin’s Creed </em>series this many years in. — Kenneth Shepard</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="5f7acd09f0011b23e1cf03e41261d5c7" data-recommend-id="image://5f7acd09f0011b23e1cf03e41261d5c7" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Adéwalé steers a ship." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Adéwalé steers a ship." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Ubisoft</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="5f7acd09f0011b23e1cf03e41261d5c7" data-recommend-id="image://5f7acd09f0011b23e1cf03e41261d5c7" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Adéwalé steers a ship." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>If it wasn’t for Adéwalé, <em>Assassin’s Creed IV: Black Flag</em> protagonist Edward Kenway would likely not have joined the Brotherhood at all. So that alone makes it worth giving Adéwalé some extra credit. But Adéwalé is more than just a sidekick of Edward.</p><p>He’s a slave who escaped that nightmare via the pirate’s life and who returns to help other freed slaves. As seen in the fantastic standalone DLC <em>Freedom’s Cry</em>, with Adéwalé’s leadership and skill, this group of freed slaves helped disrupt the slave trade and likely saved many lives in the process. It’s just a shame his adventure was so short. -Zack Zwiezen </p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="dccc2efcc07a4b7e3c20c1dc84904622" data-recommend-id="image://dccc2efcc07a4b7e3c20c1dc84904622" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Basim talks over a campfire." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Basim talks over a campfire." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Ubisoft</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="dccc2efcc07a4b7e3c20c1dc84904622" data-recommend-id="image://dccc2efcc07a4b7e3c20c1dc84904622" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Basim talks over a campfire." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Basim Ibn Ishaq was first introduced as a mysterious and possibly dangerous Assassin in <em>Assassin’s Creed: Valhalla. </em>And, spoilers for that game, it’s eventually revealed that he’s actually the reincarnated Issu god Loki. Don’t worry about it. Anyway, 2023’s <em>Assassin’s Creed: Mirage</em> reveals Basim’s origins, including his early life as a street thief and his journey within the Brotherhood. Throughout <em>Mirage </em>it’s clear that Basim is being manipulated and yet, even as people he trusts betray him, the assassin never stops trying to help people.</p><p>And, like Ezio before him, Basim is a charming rogue, too. The people’s hero. Someone willing to always help the oppressed and fight the power, even if that means the Brotherhood itself. That makes the end of <em>Mirage </em>and Basim’s evolution into a more troubled villain—who appears in <em>Valhalla</em>—all the more painful. He was once better than that. It also makes him one of the more complicated and nuanced protagonists in the franchise. -Zack Zwiezen</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="c09bb53e84483407eada6991c8fb54d9" data-recommend-id="image://c09bb53e84483407eada6991c8fb54d9" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Evie in her assassin clothes." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Evie in her assassin clothes." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Ubisoft</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="c09bb53e84483407eada6991c8fb54d9" data-recommend-id="image://c09bb53e84483407eada6991c8fb54d9" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Evie in her assassin clothes." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>I admit, I haven’t played <em>Syndicate </em>since its release almost a decade ago, and I don’t deny that some of my enjoyment of Evie at the time rested in the novelty of her being (at long last!) the first playable female character in a mainline <em>Assassin’s Creed </em>game, albeit one who had to share the spotlight with her brother. But there’s more to her greatness than that. Where her hotheaded brother Jacob is reckless and unreasonable, Evie’s ability to stay cool under pressure makes her the real brains of the operation, making it all the more frustrating that the story increasingly focuses on Jacob as it progresses. She’s also genuinely charismatic and likable, which is especially important given how bleak and oppressive the streets of Victorian London can often feel. Evie isn’t naive about the horrible conditions of the city she lives in; far from it, she’s determined to do something about them. But rather than letting the gloom of it all infect her, she stays focused, clever, hopeful, and capable. And her battle-of-wits rapport with her brother is often delightful, leaving little doubt as to who’s the smarter and sharper of the two. Thankfully she wasn’t the <em>last </em>female protagonist in a mainline <em>AC </em>game, but as the first, she proved to be a terrific demonstration of how empty and absurd an excuse for their absence “<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.autostraddle.com/ubisoft-cant-have-female-characters-because-women-are-too-difficult-to-animate-one-million-eyes-are-rolled-241278/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.autostraddle.com/ubisoft-cant-have-female-characters-because-women-are-too-difficult-to-animate-one-million-eyes-are-rolled-241278/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">women are too hard to animate</a></span>” had always been.—Carolyn Petit</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="5de69462567546d09211b82f94d2976f" data-recommend-id="image://5de69462567546d09211b82f94d2976f" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Edward standing on a ship as a whale passes by." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Edward standing on a ship as a whale passes by." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Ubisoft</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="5de69462567546d09211b82f94d2976f" data-recommend-id="image://5de69462567546d09211b82f94d2976f" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Edward standing on a ship as a whale passes by." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>  <em>Assassin’s Creed IV: Black Flag</em> holds a special place in fans’ hearts for its sea-faring pirate spin on the franchise. A big part of why that tonal shift works so well is thanks to protagonist Edward Kenway. As a swashbuckling, brash assassin, he’s the opposite of what we’d been taught to expect from this series’ heroes. No sly, subtle shadow operative, he’s more synonymous with bar fights and ship battles reeking of gunpowder. As such, he’s a rollicking, exciting hero to play whether he’s on land or sea, but he also has moments of quiet reflection that round him out. Shoutout to <em>Constantine</em> actor Matt Ryan for capturing the character’s emotional range in his lone video game credit. Get him in more games, I say. — Kenneth Shepard </p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="05e260496add116fe9109d04ba9b93b9" data-recommend-id="image://05e260496add116fe9109d04ba9b93b9" data-format="jpg" data-width="1918" data-height="1076" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Kassandra readies to deliver a killing stab." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Kassandra readies to deliver a killing stab." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Ubisoft</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="05e260496add116fe9109d04ba9b93b9" data-recommend-id="image://05e260496add116fe9109d04ba9b93b9" data-format="jpg" data-width="1918" data-height="1076" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Kassandra readies to deliver a killing stab." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><em>Assassin’s Creed: Odyssey</em>’s Greek heroes, though distinct characters in the canon, serve the same role in the game regardless of which you choose to play as. Though Kassandra is technically the canonical choice, as per her appearance in <em>Assassin’s Creed Valhalla</em>, both embody the same bold, heroic nature. Like Eivor, Kassandra and Alexios are RPG protagonists that are somewhat defined by player choice, but they’re known for their headstrong and witty nature, which makes their heroics and human interactions memorable. Their journey culminates in a stunning final scene in which they survive until the modern day by using the Staff of Hermes. It’s fascinating that Kassandra and Alexios both set things into motion in their prime in Greece, and survive long enough to nudge the course of history once more in the present. They are heroic, charismatic, and some of the most memorable characters in the series. — Kenneth Shepard</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="3a59dd360c62710f766f8ef432672e03" data-recommend-id="image://3a59dd360c62710f766f8ef432672e03" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Ezio with his hood up." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Ezio with his hood up." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Ubisoft</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="3a59dd360c62710f766f8ef432672e03" data-recommend-id="image://3a59dd360c62710f766f8ef432672e03" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Ezio with his hood up." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>It’s almost impossible not to feel like Ezio Auditore da Firenze epitomizes<em> Assassin’s Creed</em>. First introduced to players in <em>Assassin’s Creed II</em>, the suave Italian stuck around longer than any other protagonist in the series. He got not one, not two, but three mainline games. What makes Ezio so enduring as an<em> Assassin’s Creed </em>protagonist is his undeniable charm and transformative story.</p><p>He starts as an uncaring rich boy and soon finds himself thrust into the path of the order after his father’s death. <em>Assassin’s Creed II </em>gives us the journey we all wanted from an <em>AC </em>game: the one that takes us from nobody to master Assassin. But Ezio’s story doesn’t stop with that. Starring in a trilogy turned Ezio into a much more complex character that players grew with through different stages of his life. It’s what makes his last outing, <em>Revelations</em>, remain so interesting. Whether an old man weighed down by a heavy life or a young brash kid out for revenge, Ezio is human and exceedingly well-portrayed in the series. There will simply never be another protagonist like him. — Willa Rowe</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="cc5b9f176b72031ad11ebf73d6706fa6" data-recommend-id="image://cc5b9f176b72031ad11ebf73d6706fa6" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Bayek enters a tomb." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Bayek enters a tomb." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Ubisoft</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="cc5b9f176b72031ad11ebf73d6706fa6" data-recommend-id="image://cc5b9f176b72031ad11ebf73d6706fa6" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Bayek enters a tomb." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>As was said in our <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/lets-rank-the-assassins-creed-games-worst-to-best-1844019813&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/lets-rank-the-assassins-creed-games-worst-to-best-1844019813">ranking of the <em>Assassin’s Creed</em> games</a></span>, <em>Origins</em>’<em> </em>main star, Bayek, is the best protagonist in the franchise’s history. He’s both a nobleman trying to bring justice and peace everywhere he goes and a father mourning the loss of his child. Watching him try to help people while also dealing with so much rage leads to some of the best moments in <em>Origins</em>. It also doesn’t hurt that Bayek is extremely likable, and written with just enough charm and wit that he doesn’t feel like a boring vessel meant only to be controlled by the player.</p><p>Bayek and his wife, Aya, are also very important characters in the <em>AC </em>universe. They both essentially founded what would become the Brotherhood of Assassins out of the grief of losing their son to an evil man, and their journey for revenge would both destroy their relationship and change history forever. -Zack Zwiezen</p></div></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Forty-five minutes to prep a lasagna. Twenty minutes to caramelize some onions. Fifteen minutes to bake cookies. Except in the case of cookie baking speedrunners, that’s actually not as outrageous as it sounds. In fact, it’s way longer than it took Twitch streamer QTCinderella to make a batch of 12 chocolate chip cookies. She completed the task in under four minutes earlier this week, throwing the cookie baking speedrun leaderboard into chaos in the process.<br></p><div data-video-id="196923" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Kotaku’s Hopes For Spyro The Dragon’s (Reported) Comeback" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="355" data-playlist="196923,196922,196918" data-current="196923"><div><p>Kotaku’s Hopes For Spyro The Dragon’s (Reported) Comeback</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196923/196923_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196923/196923_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196923/196923_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196923/196923_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/22494.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><p>“I AM THE CURRENT SPEED RUN RECORD HOLDER FOR A DOZEN COOKIES,” she <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/qtcinderella/status/1790486384953987170&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/qtcinderella/status/1790486384953987170" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tweeted</a></span> on May 14. A snapshot of the Speedrun.com leaderboard showed recent players shredding the previous records, many of which were in the double digits. So how did QTCinderalla, a popular stream who has frequently incorporated baking into her content, including last year’s Master Baker Twitch competitions, manage to bake cookies in under four minutes?</p><p>The record-breaking run required a few significant time-saving tricks. The first was having all of the ingredients pre-measured, including oil substituted for butter. The second was having the oven and baking sheet pre-heated and extra hot. Finally, QTCinderalla used her hands to mix, a cookie scoop to quickly get blobs of dough on the cookie sheet, and then a second cookie sheet smooshed on top to expedite the baking process. It took roughly two minutes to get the confections in the oven and just 96 seconds to cook them to, well, maybe not perfection, but something surprisingly close. “Still moist, not raw, bitch,” she told her stream. “And they taste good!”</p><p>This was all in keeping with the loose rules of the speedrunning challenge, a niche IRL offshoot of the<em> </em><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/fuck-me-i-cant-stop-playing-cookie-clicker-1847794400&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/fuck-me-i-cant-stop-playing-cookie-clicker-1847794400"><em>Cookie Clicker</em> PC game category</a></span>. In addition to being completely baked through, the cookies were also more than big enough at over three inches wide each. But not everyone was pleased with the record-setting breakthrough. Shortly after celebrating her victory, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.speedrun.com/cclickermemes/news/13ejp564&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.speedrun.com/cclickermemes/news/13ejp564" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Speedrun.com decided to re-evaluate the category</a></span>. “We are temporarily archiving the IRL baking category in order to reevaluate the rules and come back with a more cohesive and comprehensive set of rules,” moderator TheStrahl wrote on the website. The new rules would codify things like which tools could be used and which cookies would pass the “baked” test.</p><p>“They are afraid of me,” QTCinderella <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/qtcinderella/status/1790560102728278070/photo/1&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/qtcinderella/status/1790560102728278070/photo/1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tweeted</a></span> in response.</p><p>“We’re not afraid, just trying to make the rules better before the inevitable shit storm of shitty speedruns you just sent my way,” TheStahl <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/TheStrahlTTV/status/1790912819606458585&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/TheStrahlTTV/status/1790912819606458585" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">later responded</a></span>. QTCinderalla wrote back,” Oh so I shouldn’t try to do a speed run on ? Fuck me right? The fun part of speed running is that ANYONE can do it. I think it’s COOL to draw attention to an unknown category. There is no reason to be rude.”</p><p>According to TheStahl, the speedrunning leaderboard gets swamped with spam, trolling, and other nonsense when niche categories blow up like this. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vaElKdZsW6N0KcKwF2rcaYFGKFrDHLWqY1zc1mo3JIA/edit&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1vaElKdZsW6N0KcKwF2rcaYFGKFrDHLWqY1zc1mo3JIA/edit" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">New rules for the 12 cookie baking speedrun challenge have already been floated</a></span> and they include things like contestants having to measure ingredients during the challenge rather than beforehand and making sure the finished cookies are circles and “as close to round as possible.”</p><p>Things get even more intense after the run is complete and the cookies are tested to make sure they’re properly baked. “First the runner will pick up a cookie to show it is structurally sound,” the new proposed rules read. “The aforementioned cookie must not completely break apart as a result. Show the bottom of the cookie to show that it has browned. The cookie will be broken in half to show that the cookie is cooked internally. Eat cookie.”</p><p>These draft rules may still be revised but they would certainly disqualify QTCinderalla’s existing record. It’s unclear if once they are settled she’ll return to protect her legacy and reclaim her title. What I do know is that the next season of The Great British Bake Off needs to include a speedrunning challenge just like this one. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/tarkov-cheaters-banned-battlestate/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>Battlestate Games just confirmed that between March 15 and May 17, it banned more than 30,000 cheaters from Escape from Tarkov, the (decreasingly) popular extraction shooter. This news might come as a wonder to some, but for those familiar with the product, it’s just another day on the job. These ban waves seem to occur once every month or two, and despite BSG kicking out tens of thousands of cheaters every time, the number never seems to meaningfully decrease.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-constant">Constant.</h2>



<p>Escape from Tarkov has a long-standing issue with cheaters. It’s a plague that has spoiled the game time and again over the years, and it has put off veteran players from continuing their extraction-based adventures and fully prevented some new players from investing in the platform.</p>



<p>Today, Battlestate Games revealed that in a two-month window, some 30,000 cheaters were banned.</p>



<p>But in March 2024, 33,000 cheaters were revealed to have been banned in two months.</p>



<p>And in January 2024, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlestate-ban-tarkov-cheaters/">11,000 cheaters were banned</a> in two weeks.</p>



<p>And in September 2023, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tarkov-cheaters-banned/">16,600 cheaters were booted off</a> the platform in one month.</p>



<p>It’s great that we’re getting a rolling tally of the number of cheaters banned, but the figure is either growing or fluctuating wildly. It’s no easy thing to stay ahead of today’s hackers and malicious operators, but it’s arguably <strong>the number one issue </strong>in Escape from Tarkov, and it doesn’t seem to be improving enough to fill players with confidence.</p>



<p>That and the recent <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/bsg-conclusion-tarkov-drama/">controversy surrounding ‘The Unheard Edition’</a> is enough to make any Tarkov player baulk at the idea of investing a sizeable amount of time in the game.</p>



<p>Once again, Battlestate Games named and shamed the thousands of cheaters, providing a spreadsheet with the name of every cheater banned from the game in this wave. There are some interesting names on the list, and fans typically scour these pages for the names of big streamers – not that they’d be named by Battlestate, of course…</p>

Ubisoft suggests a SSD for the best experience. Ubisoft's shooter has been a long time coming, having held an open beta last summer only to be <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisofts-cod-style-shooter-xdefiant-delayed-indefinitely/1100-6518278/" data-ref-id="1100-6518278">delayed multiple times</a> despite nearly releasing late last year.

It also features character classes representing factions from other Ubisoft games like Splinter Cell, The Division, and Far Cry. One key way <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/as-call-of-duty-continues-attracting-skill-based-matchmaking-complaints-xdefiant-goes-in-a-different-direction/1100-6523492/" data-ref-id="1100-6523492">XDefiant looks to set itself apart is by not including skill-based matchmaking</a>, something that has been a hot topic among Call of Duty fans in recent years. It will also feature cross-play and cross-progression across platforms.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/aftermath-hours-podcast-animal-well-1000xresist<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The video game industry is clearly in a transition period, and even though the full effects won’t be felt for years, we’re already getting hit by reverberations. Triple-A games have been <a href="https://aftermath.site/video-games-palworld-helldivers-manor-lords-aaa" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">few and far between recently</a> while indies have been absolutely flourishing – and getting some much-deserved shine from the press and public. On this week’s episode of Aftermath Hours, we discuss why a less triple-A-heavy future might not be such a bad thing.</p><p>Chris, Riley, and I begin by discussing <em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em>, which is set in feudal Japan and stars two main characters: a ninja and a samurai. It looks more interesting than the past few games in the series, if nothing else! Of course, since the ninja is a woman and the samurai is black, <a href="https://aftermath.site/assassins-creed-shadows-yasuke-racism" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a certain subset of gamers are Big Mad</a>. We (begrudgingly) talk about them, too. Then we move on to<em> </em><a href="https://www.animalwell.net/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Animal Well</em></a>, an unexpected Metroidvania-but-not hit that came out last week. Chris loves it, Riley doesn’t get it. (Gentle) fireworks ensue.&nbsp;</p><p>After that, we talk about <a href="https://x.com/Toadsanime/status/1788599443341599114" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the recent flood of extremely good indie games</a> and how triple-A publishers – who’ve chosen to go all in on a small handful of big hits, <a href="https://aftermath.site/microsoft-layoffs-franchises-ip-sony-ea" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">at the expense of everything else</a> – have forgotten how to make these types of games that there’s clearly still a hunger for. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1675830/1000xRESIST/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>1000xResist</em></a> is basically a new <em>Nier </em>while <em>Nier</em>’s actual creator is off making gacha games.<em> </em><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1574240/Dread_Delusion/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Dread Delusion</em></a> is a spiritual successor to <em>Morrowind </em>in the year of our lord 2024. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1885110/Cryptmaster/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Cryptmaster</em></a><em> </em>is… well, <em>Crypmaster </em>is just cool as hell.&nbsp;</p><p>You can find this week's episode below and on <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/7qtlX6MNeEoyNuHBU0chUJ?si=a2f12b75911f43cb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Spotify</a>, <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/aftermath-hours/id1727407094" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Apple</a>, or wherever else you prefer to listen to podcasts. If you like what you hear, make sure to leave a review so that we can eventually fund Chris’ idea for a<em> Splinter-Cell</em>-esque spies-versus-mercs-style multiplayer game, except it’s ninja-vs-samurai and it’s set in feudal Japan. It practically sells itself!</p><p>Here’s an excerpt from our conversation:</p><p><strong>Chris:</strong> I think [<em>Animal Well</em>] hits at the right time, which is – narratively, I guess – indies are having a bigger moment now specifically because of the environment that we’re in. Because big companies don’t know how to handle small-to-medium-sized games anymore. And so, to just have this one drop and to be like “Oh, this is a perfect game. What was stopping [bigger companies] from doing that?” Particularly relative to all the Microsoft shit and the Square Enix shit, where they don’t know how to market these small and medium-sized games.&nbsp;</p><p>You had a great week this week of indie titles – more than I could play. I actually tried to play all of them. I was playing <em>Cryptmaster</em> earlier, and that game is so fucking good. That game is really funny. There’s just a lot of games out. There’s a lot of bangers in a row. And it just comes at a time when it doesn’t seem like any big publisher knows what the fuck they’re doing.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Riley: </strong>I think it’s [a byproduct of] something we saw a lot this week with Square and Ubisoft and with some earnings reports last week. All these companies are like “We’re pivoting to less games.” And you have in contrast to that all these killer indies, and a big company can’t just say “Let’s do that!” I’m sure there’s somebody in a room somewhere demanding Ubisoft’s <em>Balatro </em>or whatever the heck. But are the big companies lumbering in the wrong direction, or is it <a href="https://aftermath.site/video-games-palworld-helldivers-manor-lords-aaa" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">like Luke’s article posited</a>: Have indies kind of– I don’t want to say risen to fill a gap, because they’ve always existed. But what is it that’s letting this moment happen?&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Chris:</strong> If there was a big, forgettable release right now, would we be caring about [these games]?</p><p><strong>Riley:</strong> But there have been, though. What happened to <em>Rise of the Ronin</em>? That came and went, huh?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Chris:</strong> Well, that came out the exact same day as <em>Dragon’s Dogma 2</em>. That was just really bad timing on their part. Also, it’s a medium-sized game.</p><p>But yeah, <em>Crow Country</em>, <em>Animal Well</em>…</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> <em>Cryptmaster</em>, <em>1000xResist</em>…</p><p><strong>Chris: </strong><em>1000xResist</em>, which I did play a little bit of, though not enough to really give it an assessment.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Riley:</strong> People say good stuff about it.</p><p><strong>Nathan: </strong>Yeah, people are saying wildly good stuff. Some are saying it’s one of the best games ever.</p><p><strong>Chris:</strong> It’s weird! I said it looks almost like <em>Second Life</em>. I don’t say that in a negative way, but it looks like some shit made in Unity. Not in a bad way; it has this affect of [being] sort of a narrative, <em>Nier</em>-type of game about the experience of diaspora. It has this high concept of going back into digital memories, and there’s clearly a lot there. It looks really interesting. It’s like if the kind of lesbian that wears Fox Racing gear to raves talked only in riddles. It’s like “I don’t actually know what you’re saying, but it’s fascinating.”&nbsp;</p><p>It’s definitely got that sort of queer <em>Nier Automata</em> affect to it, but done in an indie game. Which I also like because it’s like, Yoko Taro’s not gonna make a <em>Nier </em>game; we’ve got one at home.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Nathan: </strong>I find it all interesting because there’s clearly room for these games, and there’s clearly hunger for these games. But then you have Square Enix, who had this strategy for a while of putting out some smaller games, and a lot of those games I think found audiences. People clearly love a lot of them, like <em>Triangle Strategy</em>. But those games did not meet “sales expectations.” And of course Square Enix has always been really bad at predicting these things.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>But you have these companies that could create a lot of these smaller games. They have the means to do it, but it’s not going to please their shareholders enough. And so they’re pivoting to these much bigger games that represent this kind of horrible roll of the dice. It’s like “Well, if this game succeeds at the scale we hope it will and expect it to, then we have our big hit – our <em>Fortnite</em>-sized, decade-lasting hit.” But if not, that is hundreds of millions of dollars down the drain. You’ve got to lay tons of people off. You’re basically done. They’re betting it all on these titanic projects, and that just doesn’t seem wise.</p><p><strong>Chris: </strong>The shit that makes me so mad about Square Enix is, their strategy of exclusivity was always going to be a bad idea. That was always going to bite them in the ass, particularly given the install base of the PS5. On top of that, they just don’t know how to market stuff. I know that’s an easy excuse, but they don’t try. I think that if you gave <em>Harvestella </em>to Atlus, they would have known how to deal with that. That would have been an interesting game for them to pitch. Square Enix was just not a good shepherd of it.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Because I hate myself a little bit – or like inflicting pain on myself – I went back and read a year-end review from the president of Square Enix. And it starts like “This was the year of the metaverse” and then proceeds to lay out all the shit they wasted time, energy, and money on for the last three years: crypto scams, NFTs, AI horseshit. Every hit you can think of – of a scam or a bad idea – they’ve been really into. What if you spent any of that time marketing these little games? Maybe you would be in less of a bad place than you are now. Maybe if you weren’t banking on a trilogy that takes ten years to make, of one game with an increasingly smaller install base and fewer people that are on board every single time, maybe you wouldn’t have this issue. But they’re baking on this [less is more] strategy, and I think it’s not going to work out for them. I think it’s going to be a bad idea – just the shortsightedness of it all.</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> It’s sad on one hand, because we are going to miss out on a lot of these smaller, more inventive games that Square Enix was making. But I guess the upside – and we’re seeing it in real time – is that other people will make games like that. Other people will take the reins and go from there. They’ll be indies, and they’ll be different. Instead of another Nier, it’s gonna be <em>1000xResist</em>, which definitely doesn’t look as big-budget, but if the ideas are there and the game is fun to play, then are we really losing that much?</p><p><strong>Riley:</strong> I like all these indie games. I’ve definitely hit that age where shorter, smaller games are definitely more my speed than “Here’s some 60-hour big-budget thing that strains the limits of my PC.” It’s exciting too, now that we have Aftermath, that we can write about these games without stressing out as much – which isn’t to say that we didn’t write about them at our other sites. But it was always a bit of a harder proposition.&nbsp;</p><p>More different things, as opposed to fewer big things from big companies, just seems great to me. What does it mean for the broader industry? All these companies are having layoffs, and they employ far more people than a developer making an indie game. But I think it’s a good thing [for games], mostly.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/ito-card-game-getting-western-localization<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A new beloved board game from Japan is coming overseas. Not a localization of a popular TTRPG like <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/cmon-partners-with-bouken-to-bring-japanese-ttrpgs-to-west"><em>Bouken</em></a>, or a translated licensed work like the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/shin-megami-tensei-ttrpg-finally-gets-english-localization"><em>Shin Megami Tensei: Nocturne</em> TTRPG</a>. It is an official English-language of the <em>Ito</em> card game, courtesy of publisher Arcane Wonders.</p>

<h2>The <em>Ito</em> Card Game English Localization Announcement</h2>

<p>According to an official press release, the <em>Ito</em> card game is a wildly popular, easy-to-learn cooperative card game. It is designed by Mitsuru Nakamura and has gained over 300,000 fans in its native region.</p>

This number can be between 1 and 100. From here, players need to work together to put their secret numbers in order on the board. Each player can provide clues to one another about what number is theirs based on several categories. They cannot directly tell their teammates their number.</p>

<p>The English localization of the Ito card game carries a mark of status. Not only is Arcane Wonders publishing the game for English-speaking territories, it will be distributed under their Dice Tower Essentials line. This is a curated line of board game whose titles include <em>Onitama</em>, <em>Aquatica</em>, and <em>Smartphone Inc. </em></p>

<p>The Dice Tower Essentials line titles are handpicked by prolific board game reviewer Tom Vaesel, the same Tom Vaesel behind The Dice Tower podcast and designer of <em>Vicious Fishes</em> and the <em>Nothing Personal</em> series.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"We are incredibly excited to partner with Arclight Games to bring <em>Ito</em> to a global audience," said Robert Geistlinger, President of Arcane Wonders. "We believe that <em>Ito</em> perfectly embodies the spirit of the Dice Tower Essentials line of games. Its engaging gameplay and universal appeal make it a perfect addition to any gamer's collection."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The English version of the <em>Ito</em> card game will retain all of the elements that made the original game great. In addition, it will add cards to randomize category selection. The game is set to make its English debut October 2024.</p>
