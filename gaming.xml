			<p><span>Somehow, Heihachi Mishima has returned. No veteran to throwing members of the Mishima family into volcanoes, Bandai Namco and Katsuhiro Harada have made a big show about Heihachi having finally died after being thrown into one himself following a staggering loss to his son Kazuya. Much like the stock price of NVIDIA this week, he just can’t stay down for long. We recently got a sneak peek at the fighter’s new story chapters and got to take the Mishima family head for our spin ourselves with a recent hands-on with <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/tekken-8-return-of-the-king/">Tekken 8</a>.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>In a candid chat with Michael Murray between rounds, he confirmed that Heihachi will not receive a Character Episode, as the Unforgotten Echoes story content serves the purpose of giving Heihachi a narrative all his own. Those who may have wanted a more light-hearted take on the Tekken Zaibatsu’s former head will sadly have to make do with a bit of creative dress-up and some fun in the sun with Tekken Ball.</span></p>
<p><span>Bandai Namco permitted us to see through the entire narrative of Unforgotten Echoes but limited what we could showcase and talk about to the first five chapters of the narrative. The narrative largely jumps around between a few key players of the Tekken Force, namely Jin Kazama and the current Prime Minister of Poland in the Tekken universe, Lidia Sobieska. Suppose you didn’t have the opportunity to purchase the additional character DLC that added Eddy Gordo and Lidia to the roster already, this will allow players to try these characters out for free as part of the story DLC. At only a couple of hours' run time, it's more of a brief appetizer to bringing Tekken's big bad into the center stage again while leaving Yoshimitsu on the sidelines once more.</span></p>
<p><span>After a series of mandatory battles and reuniting some of the cast together, Tekken 8 Unforgotten Echoes rapidly brings players back face to face with Heihachi Mishima, a man who’s a mere shell of his former self. As Lidia, Yoshimitsu, and Eddy are brought together, they’re introduced to a sect of Tekken Monks secretly training in the forest for reasons best left for the player to discover. Among these monks, the most powerful of which are named after the four guardian spirits that protect Kyoto. If you’ve experienced some sort of Japanese mythology, chances are you’re at least remotely familiar with Genbu, Seiryu, et cetera. Heihachi Mishima has passively aligned himself with these monks as a much more meek version of himself, perhaps attributed to a bout of amnesia or perhaps regret towards seeing his sons routinely chucked into an active volcano time and time again. Heihachi has really let his hair down this time around and I couldn’t help but take note that he seemed to be taking a liking to Hulk Hogan’s hairstyle in his later years.</span></p>
<p><span>The ole Iron Hand wielder himself comes with a few new tricks up his sleeve when it comes to bringing him out in versus combat. He’ll also come out swinging with a new stage, Genmaji Temple, based on the secluded training grounds of the Tekken Monks, which features a nighttime variant with complementary mood lighting. As part of Heihachi’s new suite of abilities, the time spent training with the Tekken Monks has also unlocked some spicy tech to add to his already intimidating bag of tricks.</span></p>
<p><span>New for the godfather of Tekken are a complimentary pair of stances: Wind God and Thunder God. Each can be linked into as part of certain combos and augment his already impressive moveset with some additional tools. Heihachi has also been granted a unique powered-up state known as the Warrior Instinct that increases the amount of damage he can deal to gray damage, or Recoverable Damage along with changing up the properties on select moves. This comes with a trade-off with only being able to be activated after going into Heat mode three times in a match, so this may be the trump card players might need to come back like a level-3 X-Factor. If reliably pulling off an Electric Wind God Fist is something that’s still outside of your muscle memory, hitting it in Warrior Instinct might even eliminate the need for frame-perfect execution.</span></p>

<p><span>I’m still on the fence about Heihachi Mishima’s return to the Tekken 8 roster, as I thought it was a bold move to finally kill off one of the series’ most infamous antagonists after so long, but I have to respect the way that Tekken 8: Unforgotten Echoes was able to bring the figurehead back in a way to feels deliberate as part of the greater story and giving him a side that’s more than just pure chaos. On the other hand, I’m not looking forward to eating another axe kick to the face after taking so many of them over the decades.</span></p>
<p><span>Heihachi Mishima will come to Tekken 8 on September 30th if you have the <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/tekken-8-playable-character-year-1-pass/9PKZ04TN37M8">Playable Character Year 1 Pass</a>. Otherwise, he will be available on October 3rd for purchase. If the pricing for Lidia and Eddy still holds true, Heihachi Mishima will be available as a standalone DLC character for $7.99. The new Unforgotten Echoes story expansion will be a free part of the Version 1.08 update for all players, allowing players to go hands-on with Heihachi, Lidia, and others while also bringing in a few new features including a customizable main menu to change up your favorite fighter on display.&nbsp;</span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-stock-prices-falls-to-11-year-low-after-assassins-creed-delay/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Ubisoft’s fall has continued in a new historical way on Thursday. The first day of trading since announcing <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-to-february-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Assassin’s Creed Shadows has been delayed</a> until February 2025 has seen Ubisoft stock prices on the London Stock Exchange fall to an 11-year low.</p>



<p>As of writing, Ubisoft stock prices sit at <a href="https://www.londonstockexchange.com/market-stock/0NVL/ubisoft-entertainment-sa/overview">€9.28 per share.</a> It’s the first time since November 2014 that shares have fallen under €10. The current trading price represents a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-stock-prices-falls-to-new-52-week-low-amid-company-turmoil/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">near-20% fall of yesterday’s decade-low</a> price.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>To add to the bad news, Ubisoft’s market cap sits at just about €1.27 billion. Just over three weeks ago, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-stock-tanks/">it was at €1.99 billion</a>. </p>



<p>Trading in the US hasn’t open as of publishing, but closed on Wednesday night at just $2.25 per share. If the London market is any indication, a drop in the US could also be expected.</p>



<p>On Wednesday, Ubisoft announced not only the aforementioned delay of Assassin’s Creed Shadows, but multiple disappointing updates for investors. It had <a href="https://staticctf.ubisoft.com/8aefmxkxpxwl/5U6140Jg0IaqobyAIIEawC/af3b587a1c81f379d57bc64eefdd0285/PR_Trading_update_25092024_final.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">lowered it’s financial targets</a> for the second quarter of FY2025 and the remainder of the year, confirmed that Star Wars Outlaws <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/star-wars-outlaws-underperformed-ubisoft-confirms/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">underperformed financially</a>, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-investigation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">opened an investigation</a> into the company.</p>



<p>The company has promised more <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/star-wars-outlaws-developers-promise-to-continue-to-improve-the-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">updates and improvements</a> to Star Wars Outlaws after the lukewarm launch. It also announced that Ubisoft games will <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-will-release-games-on-steam-on-day-one/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">return to having Day One releases</a> on Steam with Assassin’ Creed Shadows.</p>



<p>As far as if those changes are good enough for investors and players to turn things around, that remains to be seen. Based on the initial response from the market, it doesn’t look good enough just yet.</p>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a> is continuing its multiplatform strategy with the release of two Mana games and the Final Fantasy Pixel Remasters on Xbox.</p>
<p>As announced today by Microsoft at the Tokyo Game Show, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/trials-of-mana">Trials of Mana</a>, Legend of Mana and the Final Fantasy Pixel Remasters are all available today across Xbox Series X/S and PC.</p>
<p>"Our partnership with Square Enix is stronger than ever," boasted Sarah Bond, president of Xbox.</p>

<p>While the two Mana games are available on Game Pass, the Final Fantasy games are not. The forthcoming Dragon Quest 3 HD-2D Remake is also coming to Xbox, but not Game Pass.</p>
<p>The Pixel Remasters include the first six Final Fantasy games, remastered to HD standards and with fresh musical orchestrations.</p>
<p>Trials of Mana is a 2020 remake of the 1995 SNES game of the same name, while Legend of Mana was originally released in 1999 for the PlayStation. It was previously rumoured the latest release, Visions of Mana, would be coming to Game Pass, but this was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/visions-of-mana-not-coming-to-game-pass-xbox-confirms">denied by Xbox</a>.</p>
<p>More details are available on <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2024/09/26/square-enix-classic-rpgs-final-fantasy-mana-dragon-quest-3/">Xbox Wire</a>.</p>
<p>Back in May, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/square-enix-aggressively-pursuing-new-multiplatform-strategy-after-reports-ff7-rebirth-underperformed-on-playstation">Square Enix stated it was "aggressively pursuing" a multiplatform strategy</a>, which would include Xbox. It's part of a move to "diversify earnings opportunities".</p>
<p>At the same time, though only recently made public, the company <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/square-enix-admits-final-fantasy-7-rebirth-and-final-fantasy-16-profits-did-not-meet-expectations">admitted profits for Final Fantasy 16 and Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth "did not meet expectations"</a>, but there's no news yet on whether these games will also make the jump to Xbox.</p>
<p>These aren't the only Square Enix games arriving on other platforms, though.</p>
<p>Announced yesterday, tactical RPG <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/triangle-strategy">Triangle Strategy</a> is heading to Meta Quest VR headsets on 31st October. It will bring a new perspective on the isometric game, allowing the camera to be freely moved and units and move selected directly using VR controllers.</p>

            <p>
Bethesda has removed the freshly-returned Thatcher's Techbase Doom mod once again - despite its creator having cheekily scrubbed it of all political references.
</p>
<p>
The publisher of Doom <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bethesda-yanks-thatchers-techbase-doom-mod-from-in-game-browser">previously pulled the mod</a>, which satirises the late and highly-controversial British prime minister, for the inclusion of "real-world politics".
</p>
<p>
But this week <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/thatchers-techbase-doom-mod-returns-in-a-blaze-of-politics-free-malicious-compliance">the mod returned in a blaze of malicious compliance</a>, retitled  ███████'█ Techbase and now with images of Thatcher covered over. The game's soundtrack was even changed from minor to major key. Alas, its return did not last long.
</p>
<p>
"Bad news everyone," Thatcher's Techbase mod creator Jim wrote on X last night, posting an image of Bethesda's latest message to him via its customer support.
</p>
<p>
"This mod has been reported one or more times for a Code of Conduct violation," Bethesda's message stated, claiming that the mod maker had still included "real-world politics" and was now "deliberately disobeying a Zenimax employee".
</p>
<p>"[The mod] has been removed. As a result, this account is receiving an official warning," Bethesda continued, with all the humour of a Conservative party political broadcast.</p>
<p>
"Further violations of any part of our Terms of Service may result in a temporary suspension or even a permanent deactivation of your account."

This seems to be the end of the road for Thatcher's Techbase - er,  ███████'█ Techbase. That said, the <a href="https://thatchers-techbase.github.io/get-original.html">original version remains available to play on PC</a> through the usual, non-Bethesda channels.

			<p>Earth Defense Force is quite possibly my favourite series of all time. I know that sounds like I’m going for a bit, but I’m really not. While I love the high-quality offerings of series like Zelda and Final Fantasy, I find they don’t always hit the spot. Tears of the Kingdom left me unenthused, and honestly, Final Fantasy hasn’t landed for me for a few years now too. EDF, on the other hand, understand the assignment every time, and Earth Defense Force: World Brothers 2 is the second cutesy take on the series.</p>
<p><iframe title="Earth Defense Force: World Brothers 2 - Launch Trailer Nintendo Switch/PS5/PS4/PC" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/52QB-0NKNeU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>World Brothers 2 is the follow-up to the voxel spinoff that <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/06/01/edf-world-brothers-review-earth-defense-force/">came out back in 2021</a>, and it just sort of feels like more of the same. You’re a person, there are things to shoot, and you get bigger things to shoot with as enemies get bigger too. The main difference is that it doesn’t feel quite as culturally insensitive so far, although I’ve somehow not unlocked all of the characters yet, because there are hundreds.</p>


<p>The core concept is the same as before, you get voxel characters who represent characters from across the series, or nationalities from across the world. That means alongside the Air Raider from EDF 6, you’ve also got characters like Yodel Sister and Viking Brother. It’s innately silly, and the cutesy art style brings with it a substantially lower difficulty as well. It makes for a good game for younger gamers, and that’s clear to see throughout. It’s why the controls are so simple, and the combat is so forgiving, and I don’t begrudge that, even though I like just a touch or two of complexity.</p>


<p>With that in mind, the game succeeds in what it’s trying to do. The weapon choices are much more limited, because every class has its specific weapon it does best with, and while you can change things up, you never need to until the hard difficulty. You also get to control a full team of four, which means you can mix and match as you please. This usually means you’ll have a Wing Diver on your team, because they can fly and it’s so fast, but other than that, the sky’s the limit.</p>
<p>It’s all good fun, but it’s just so… beige. Not the colours, of course, but the flavour of the whole thing. I didn’t leave any moment thinking “Wow, this is incredible.” Instead, it’s just pushing through levels for the sake of it, collecting new characters because they’re there. It’s definitely a lot more entertaining in multiplayer, and I still love the idea that this is some weird multiversal event, but it just doesn’t feel like anything’s really at stake, even when the story is telling you otherwise.</p>

<p>Ultimately, the biggest sin that World Brothers 2 commits is coming out so soon after <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/02/earth-defense-force-6-review/">Earth Defense Force 6</a>, which is not only the best the series has ever been by a fairly large margin, but also manages to be one of the best games about time travel around.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-already-runs-at-above-120-fps-on-pc-via-the-ryujinx-emulator.992805/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-120-fps-pc/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Despite being released today, The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom is already playable on PC with high framerates thanks to one of the Nintendo Switch emulators available.</p>
<p>As showcased in a new video put together by reznoire, the latest entry in the series, and the first one to feature Princess Zelda as the main character, can run at above 120 frames per second via the the latest public version of the Ryujinx emulator that can be downloaded <a href="https://ryujinx.org/download">here</a>. While reznoire used a power system powered by an i9-14900K CPU, RTX 4090, and 32 GB RAM), less powerful systems shouldn't have any trouble running the game at acceptable framerates, given how it's not among the most demanding Nintendo Switch games around.</p>
<p><iframe title="Ryujinx 1.1.1398 3xIR | Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom (Uncapped FPS) Gameplay" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Q9M0SAJGBUQ?start=4&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>While The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom definitely brings new ideas to the table, the game's main focus is the modernization of the classic 2D experience of the franchise. Not every one of the game's features is extremely well-realized, but there's no denying that the experience is worth any Zelda series fan's time, as highlighted by Nathan in his<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom/"> review.</a></p>
<p><em>The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom brings some new ideas to the table, but in the end, the game is more about modernizing the classic 2D Zelda experience. The attention-grabbing echo copying mechanic has its pros and cons, but where Echoes of Wisdom consistently hits is in the tried-and-true design of its world and dungeons, which are as good as any the franchise has delivered in the past. This may be Zelda's first starring adventure, but past Legends still echo strongly here.</em></p>
<p>The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom is now available on Nintendo Switch.</p>

            <p>Indie developers love making retro-styled games that look like PlayStation games you rented from Blockbuster and blitzed through in a feverish winter weekend. I'm glad, so here's another. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/cold-and-afraid">Cold And Afraid</a> is a murder mystery that aims to channel the 1990s with chunky characters and lots of lovely dithering. You play a detective out to stop a serial killer with a grisly pattern who's preying on the young women of an unnamed US city. On top of the obligatory tank controls, it aims to have "consequential dialogue choices" and a "Time Event system where you must meet certain people at specific times to forward different story threads". Ah, forgive me, you're here to see the chunky limbs. Here's a recent trailer that shows 'em.</p>

<p>"The retro style indie game trend has gone crazy," says solo developer Sunamii. "But I want this to be the greatest one you've ever played.</p>
<p>"In a genre where visuals are given priority over substance, Cold and Afraid places consequential dialogue choices, and the relationships you develop with characters at the heart of the experience."</p>
<p>Its cinematic slant reminds me a bit of Indigo Prophecy (that's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fahrenheit-indigo-prophecy">Fahrenheit</a> for you US folk), which was technically a PS2 game but let's not split hairs. Cold And Afraid has been in development for a bit, but we've not reported on it yet, probably because nobody here loves the warping textures and jagged vectors of Sony's glorious grey box as much as I do. "I'm working hard on getting a demo ready," says the developer. Take your time, my friend. I encourage cookery, as the youth say.</p>
<p>Cold And Afraid is not the developer's only PS1-styled project. They've also listed dungeon explorer <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2923590/Twilight_Bastion/">Twilight Bastion</a> on Steam. It started as a homage to PlayStation game Vagrant Story but shifted a little in feeling as the creator worked on it. </p>
<p>"As development progressed," they say in <a href="https://x.com/Sunamii_games/status/1769096290518905173">a xeet</a>, "it has become more of a mix between Demon's Souls x Symphony of the Night." </p>
<p>Those are some tough acts to follow. As a solo dev, Sunamii seems to like setting high bars. Speaking about Cold And Afraid, they say they want it to leave a lasting impact.</p>
<p>"A lot of indie games come and go. Released one week, forgotten the next. If the same happens for this one, then I've failed. Your work must live beyond release week."</p>
<p>Sunamii also previously released <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1997920/Isolania/">Isolania</a>, an adventure game about living, working, eating, and sleeping within the confines of a small cell to escape an ongoing plague (oh hello traumatic Covid memories how have you been?). </p>
<p>As for the PS1 retro craze, it kicked off in earnest following the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/try-25-lo-fi-spooky-demos-in-the-the-haunted-ps1-demo-disk-2021">Haunted PS1 Demo Discs</a>, which have been  wonderful yearly compilations of small retro-styled horror games. But other developers are embracing the aesthetic, including PS1 moderno-mementos like the upcoming <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/sorry-were-closed">Sorry We're Closed</a> and (arguably) <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dread-delusion">Dread Delusion</a>, which features the jittering vectors characteristic of Sony's machine even while it hews closer to PC classic's like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-iii-morrowind">Morrowind</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>During the Tokyo Game Show, Bethesda Game Studios took up a segment of the Xbox presentation to talk about Fallout 76. After praising the growth of the game in the region and celebrating some fantastic C.A.M.P. creations, Jon Rush, the game’s creative director, announced that <strong>pets are finally coming to the game</strong>.</p>



<p>This long-awaited addition means that players will soon be able to have cats and dogs around their C.A.M.P.s, doing the things that cute animals do, like lounging around and digging up holes in your backyard.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-it-took-them-long-enough">It Took Them Long Enough</h2>



<p>Fallout 76’s players have been waiting so long to have pets in their C.A.M.P.s. For the longest time, they’ve been able to tame creatures from across the Appalachian wasteland, but it hasn’t really been a feature that has amounted to much.</p>



<p>During the Tokyo Game Show, Bethesda showcased a brief snippet of the pets coming to Fallout 76 soon. We saw a basket fit for a cat and a doghouse fit for… Well, a dog. In the next few moments, we saw the animals exploring, interacting with their environment, and being customised by the player.</p>



<p>Jon Rush said during the stream:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Speaking about the future, we’d like to confirm some exciting news. Cat and dog people rejoice – we’re excited to tell you that CAMP pets are finally coming to Fallout 76 at the end of this year.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>I assume that they’ll be restricted to the C.A.M.P. setting and they won’t be joining players on their adventures across the West Virginian wasteland, but you never know – that might come next.</p>

<p>NetEase and Bad Guitar have revealed that FragPunk, a developing first-person shooter with some intriguing mechanics, will enter a closed beta phase on October 10. This eye-popping, visually impressive shooter wasn’t revealed too long ago, and it has already succeeded in turning the heads of many competitive players worldwide.</p>



<p>Could this be the next best esports title, or is it just adding to the oversaturation of the first-person shooter market?</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-fragpunk-combines-guns-and-cards">FragPunk Combines Guns and Cards</h2>



<p>FragPunk has a unique premise – it allows players to utilise a range of ‘cards’ to power up their character and equip powerful abilities. For instance, they can equip a card that gives them a ‘controllable flashbang’ attachment, while at the same time, they could equip a card that allows them to <strong>counter </strong>that very ability.</p>



<p>With a line-up made up of boosted armour abilities, weightlessness, and other, more ethereal powers, the card system in FragPunk promises to keep things fresh and unpredictable. That means it’s pretty wild for an esports title, but as long as it’s somewhat controllable, it should succeed in the scene.</p>



<p>While FragPunk’s release date is unknown, it was confirmed during the Tokyo Game Show that it’ll enter a closed beta phase on October 10. This crossplay-compatible test will run on Xbox and PC — but it wasn’t confirmed how long it’ll run for.</p>



<p>With a slew of hero-style characters, traditional first-person shooter mechanics, and typical modes, FragPunk will need to do something special to stand out from the ocean of similar titles.</p>



<p>Are you looking forward to FragPunk? Let us know on the Insider Gaming forum.</p>

            <p>I reckon I've got quite a strong long term memory. For instance, I can recall that time I read Stoner on a backpacking trip through Italy and realising that I particularly like sad books. I can also recall the delicious taste of a Mars Delight chocolate bar. But my short term memory, whew. Yeah it's not so good. And the demo for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/disposition">Disposition</a>, a liminal escape room game where you've got to remember how things are arranged in rooms, has hammered this point home.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>In Disposition you play as a test subject of a mysterious, dystopian research facility. The kind where corridors are shiny and white, and the office equipment is from the 90s: often chunky, often grey. You are to ascend the floors of this facility, but to do so, you must pass a series of tests between each elevator ride upwards. And those tests involve walking into rooms and observing how objects are placed within them. Once you've left these rooms, the doors lock behind you, and you're dropped an object from within them: a projector, a red lamp, a screen. It's then up to you to enter an identically laid out room, only with some or all objects missing, and place that object where you believe it was previously (you do this with a physics-based hold-and-release throw).</p>
<p>Get it right and you're clear to ascend. A new room! More objects, even tougher memory recall and the ever growing paranoia of mind blanks. Get it wrong, though, and… you start from floor zero.</p>

<p>In my brief time with the demo, I ascended to around floor 6 by some miracle. And that was with the help of a walkie talkie, whose growing or lessening static acts as a guide to where you should position the object. It does have a limited battery life, though, so you must use it sparingly. Otherwise, I spent most of the demo diligently scanning rooms for every little object only to forget all of them the moment those doors closed. Sometimes the game's really devious and starts popping objects in really random spots, like typewriters nestled bizarrely next to doors. I do wonder if those challenges will twist more as time goes by, as the Steam page mentions that "you must detect anomalies" and that "these challenges change every floor you ascend".</p>
<p>There's absolutely a story here, too, as failure led me to a corridor where I saw a man with a video tape for a head. The narrator over the tannoy said that they're a longtime employee. Yeaaaah, it's creepy.</p>
<p>Oh, and there's a timer ticking away if you want to race against others on a leaderboard or challenge yourself. Perhaps there are more timed elements on higher floors, but this is pure speculation and I doubt I'll ever get to that point.</p>
<p>There's no release date on this one just yet, but it should be due out sometime soon. If you want to give the demo a go yourself, you can find it here on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3051480/Disposition/">Steam</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Ubisoft has played down the suggestion that <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-codename-red">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> sales will suffer as a result of its delay into 2025 - the same year we know <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-reveals-ghost-of-yotei-the-follow-up-to-ghost-of-tsushima">the recently-announced Ghost of Yōtei</a> will also arrive.
</p>
<p>
Both games are set in feudal Japan, and Ghost of Yōtei's unveiling during Sony's State of Play broadcast this week received a warm reception.
</p>
<p>
But, speaking to investors via an impromptu financial briefing last night, Ubisoft boss Yves Guillemot said there was room for both games to do well.
</p>
<p>
"There is a lot of space for high-quality games, and those two games can sell very well," Guillemot said.
</p>
<p>
"On the competition relative to Assassin's Creed Shadows, the focus is really to make sure we deliver a fantastic experience, and with the game's dual protagonist approach, with two different and complementary gameplays with Yasuke and Naoe, and the setting taking place in feudal Japan - that should be really enticing. 
</p>
<p>
"So all the focus and everything that forms our decisions is to make sure we polish the game and provide this fantastic promise," Guillemot concluded.
</p>
<p>
Assassin's Creed Shadows will now launch on 14th February 2025, as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-to-2025-following-learnings-from-star-wars-outlaws">a result of Ubisoft's dramatic delay to the project</a> announced last night. 
</p>
<p>
The extra time will be spent polishing the game and readying a Steam launch for the title on day one - something <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/all-new-ubisoft-games-to-release-day-one-on-steam-starting-next-february">Ubisoft is now working to provide as standard going forward</a>. 
</p>
<p>
Last night, Ubisoft said it was acting now to delay Assassin's Creed Shadows following the underperformance of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/star-wars-outlaws-review">Star Wars Outlaws</a>, whose sales had not matched expectations.

		<p>Time has finally caught up with bandit prince Robin Hood, as Sumo Digital and Focus Entertainment have announced the shutdown of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/hood-outlaws-and-legends">Hood: Outlaws &amp; Legends</a> servers in February next year. With this being an online only game, this will render the game completely unplayable.</p>
<p>Here’s what’s going to happen:</p>


<p><strong>October 16, 2024</strong><br>
– Digital and physical retail sales will stop<br>
– Refunds will be offered to players who purchased the game 14 days prior to this announcement until the termination of sales</p>
<p><strong>February 18, 2025</strong><br>
– End of service: Hood: Outlaws &amp; Legends will no longer be playable</p>
<p>The team writes:</p>

<blockquote><p>We regret to inform you that our game, Hood: Outlaws &amp; Legends, will be ending service on February 18. After this date, the game, along with any Editions, DLCs, and Battle Pass items, will no longer be accessible.</p>
<p>This has been a difficult but necessary decision, and we understand it may be disappointing. The Hood teams deeply thank you for your support and dedication throughout this incredible adventure. We cherished every part of it and we hope your memories of Hood: Outlaws &amp; Legends will be as treasured as ours.</p></blockquote>
<p>Hood: Outlaws &amp; Legends launched back in mid-2021 and was supported with three seasons of content through the first year, most notably adding in a pure co-op mode alongside the main PvPvE game. However, as is so often the case for live games, failing to gather a large enough audience led to Sumo and Focus stop producing content after that time. The game’s servers have kept running since then, but they’re going to pull the plug after just under 4 years.</p>
<p>Hood Outlaws &amp; Legends took the classic tale of Robin Hood and his Merry Men and weaves it into an intriguing online multiplayer game. It’s PvPvE as two teams of four fight each other&nbsp;<em>and</em>&nbsp;pesky guards in order to sneak into a fortified position and steal a big load of loot.</p>
<p>There’s fun to be had, but it’s not entirely successful. In our&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/05/12/hood-outlaws-and-legends-review/">Hood Outlaws &amp; Legends review</a>, Gamoc said “Hood: Outlaws and Legends has some good ideas, but the execution is a little lacking. […] With more variety, whether in the form of different modes or with each map having its own objectives, this could have been a winner, but as it stands it’s got a lot of squandered potential.”</p>

<p>Escape from Tarkov’s 0.15.2.0 patch is here and it has added some immense updates to the game. Battlestate Games has boosted the game’s ‘transition’ mechanic, linking more maps than ever before and making it so that every raid is eligible for transitions – even Player Scav and PvE runs.</p>



<p>The team also added the ‘Mortar Strike’ event, a deadly new limited-time change that will quite literally blow the minds of players on various maps.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-duck-and-cover">Duck and Cover</h2>



<p>Mortar Strike promises to be quite interesting as events go. Per the details, ‘locals’ have uncovered stockpiles of mortar shells and launchers and are now shelling various maps, just because they can.</p>



<p>That means that Customs, Woods, Shoreline, and Reserve are fair game for spontaneous mortar attacks. Nobody is safe, as this will even impact those playing PvE <strong>and </strong>practice modes. This terrifying event will keep players on their toes, but it’ll also cause AI-driven characters to ‘react appropriately’ when shells start flying.</p>



<p>Mortar Strike has a unique in-game quest that goes hand-in-hand with the event. When you take part in this questline, you’ll be able to unlock:</p>



<ul>
<li>A special equipment item that warns about the start of mortar fire in advance to help avoid dangerous areas</li>



<li>A special consumable item that initiates mortar fire at the player’s position</li>



<li>A unique achievement as a reward for finishing the task line, available only during the event</li>
</ul>



<p>It’ll be interesting to see how the mortar strikes behave once the 0.15.2.0 patch has been deployed. </p>



<p>Fear not – we’ll have a Mortar Strike guide going live as soon as the game comes online following the update.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/tarkov-update-transition-raid-map/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/tarkov%E2%80%99s-latest-update-adds-map-transitions-to-every-raid-even-pve-runs.992739/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/tarkov-update-transition-raid-map/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Escape from Tarkov’s latest update – 0.15.2.0 – is being added to the game as we speak, and what a doozy it is. Battlestate Games has cooked with this update, adding transitions to <strong>every raid, </strong>including PvE mode <strong>and </strong>Player Scav runs. With a slew of new transitions being added, players are now able to stay in their raid for as long as they desire, swapping between maps at will.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-never-escape">Never Escape</h2>



<p>For a while, the transition feature was relatively locked down, and only Marathon-seeking players were taking full advantage of the feature. Now, in 0.15.2.0, every player has the opportunity to seek out transitions in every raid – even Player Scavs. This means you’re free to skip between maps as you see fit, using strategic extracts to pass between the borders that existed for so many years.</p>



<p>For the 0.15.2.0 patch, Battlestate Games has made it so that transitions can take place just one minute after the start of a raid, which means you’re free to sprint between maps as fast as your feet can carry you, right off the bat.</p>



<p><strong>Many </strong>new transit points have also been added:</p>



<ul>
<li>Streets of Tarkov &gt; Ground Zero</li>



<li>Interchange &gt; Streets of Tarkov</li>



<li>Customs &gt; Reserve</li>



<li>Customs &gt; Interchange</li>



<li>Factory &gt; Customs</li>



<li>Factory &gt; The Lab</li>



<li>Woods &gt; Factory</li>



<li>Woods &gt; Lighthouse</li>



<li>Reserve &gt; Customs</li>



<li>Reserve &gt; Woods</li>



<li>Lighthouse &gt; Reserve</li>



<li>Lighthouse &gt; Woods</li>



<li>Shoreline &gt; Lighthouse</li>
</ul>



<p>If you want to maximise your XP gains, complete multiple events on several maps with minimal breaks, and tick boxes like ‘Marathon’, then you’re better placed now than ever before to do just that. </p>



<p>Per the game’s ‘lore’, every map in Tarkov is inherently linked in some way, with some extracts stating quite obviously where they lead to, but up until a few weeks ago, you had to leave a raid to connect to another map and begin anew.</p>



<p>This <a href="https://www.escapefromtarkov.com/news/id/315" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">is a major update</a> that adds a few more interesting features and fixes to Escape from Tarkov. For instance, a new ‘Mortar Strike’ event has been added to all game modes that’s sure to keep users on their toes, and a slew of balancing changes and quality-of-life improvements have been applied.</p>



<p>Yes, that means that Battlestate Games has adjusted some of the audio issues that have been running wild since the wipe hit. </p>

            <p>Nintendo's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/shigeru-miyamoto">Shigeru Miyamoto</a> has stated the company would "rather go in a different direction" when it comes to using AI.</p>
<p>In an interview with the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/25/arts/design/shigeru-miyamoto-interview-nintendo-museum.html">New York Times</a>, Miyamoto discussed the importance of originality for the company and what makes Nintendo special, using AI as an example.</p>
<p>"It might seem like we are just going the opposite direction for the sake of going in the opposite direction, but it really is trying to find what makes Nintendo special," said Miyamoto. "There is a lot of talk about AI, for example. When that happens, everyone starts to go in the same direction, but that is where Nintendo would rather go in a different direction."</p>

<p>The company's pursuit of originality was instilled by Nintendo president Hiroshi Yamauchi.</p>
<p>"Mr. Yamauchi back in the day would tell us that we are not good at fighting: 'We are weak - so don't go picking fights with other companies,'" said Miyamoto.</p>
<p>The Mario and Zelda creator was interviewed in celebration of the newly-opened Nintendo Museum.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/inside-the-nintendo-museum-a-joyful-celebration-of-machines-magic-and-the-art-of-play">Eurogamer also visited the museum</a>, calling it "a joyful celebration of machines, magic and the art of play".</p>

<p>By contrast, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ai-is-the-very-core-of-our-business-says-ea-ceo">EA CEO Andrew Wilson last week</a> stated AI is "the very core of our business", while <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nvidia-boss-we-cant-do-graphics-anymore-without-ai">Nvidia boss Jensen Huang</a> has discussed the advantages of the technology to advance graphical capabilities.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>The PlayStation 5 Pro 30th Anniversary bundle went live just after 10am this morning, priced at £960, and sold out within seconds.</p>
<p>It's unclear how much stock was available to purchase here in the UK. In total, just 12,300 of the PlayStation 5 Pro 30th Anniversary Editions will be available worldwide.</p>

<p>This Anniversary bundle comprises the limited edition console, as well as a limited edition DualSense Edge wireless controller, a limited edition DualSense wireless controller, a limited edition DualSense charging station, a limited edition console cover for disc drive, the limited edition vertical stand, an original PlayStation controller-style cable connector housing, four PlayStation shapes cable ties, a PlayStation sticker, a limited edition PlayStation poster (one of 30 possible designs) and a PlayStation paperclip.</p>
<p>"This special version of the PS5 Pro console and accompanying accessories feature throwback design elements and a legacy colour scheme that pays homage to the legendary original PlayStation console," reads the bundle's blurb on <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/30th-anniversary-collection/#:~:text=PlayStation%C2%AE5%20Pro%20Console%20%E2%80%93%2030%20th%20Anniversary%20Limited%20Edition%20Bundle.">PlayStation's website</a>. </p>
<p>"Each Limited Edition PS5 Pro console is individually numbered as a collector’s item, and only 12,300 of these numbered consoles will be available for customers to purchase globally."
</p>
<p>The first PlayStation console launched in Japan on 3rd December 1994, making it 30 in just a little over two months time. Where are the years going? I just wonder if it will also suffer from increasingly creaky joints and a touch of backache in the morning.  </p>
<p>As <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-5-pro-and-digital-edition-30th-anniversary-limited-edition-consoles-announced">Tom wrote last week</a>, those of us here on the shores of Blighty had to wait a little longer to get our hands on the console, however. In fact, we had to wait until September 1995 for the PlayStation 1 to arrive on these shores.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/26/hush-hush-high-preview-no-gossip-girl/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Everyone loves a bit of gossip, no matter how much they deny it. Sometimes you just want someone to spill the tea, or maybe you are the gossipmonger yourself? In Hush Hush High, you are that gossiper, called Mochi, but you have been told you cannot gossip. It is your worst nightmare, and as the school day progresses it just gets harder and harder to keep the secrets to yourself.</p>
<p><iframe title="Hush Hush High - Demo Release Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/aW2i6m1jCXo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The Monday gossip was that a girl called The Influencer claimed she had got a new bag from Paris, but that is a lie. Scandalous! And yet, you are sworn to secrecy and have to try and navigate the school day. The school day starts with picking up your ID and checking your task list, which includes things like lessons and optional tasks like handing in some work. Sounds simple enough, right? Sure, except every task you complete raises the eagerness rating. The higher this rating goes the faster gossip spreads. But for the gossip to spread, you need to spill the beans first.</p>


<p>High school is an absolute minefield of people you can talk to. Every few steps is a test as you are tasked with holding Mochi back from gossiping. This is represented by a bar in which you have to button mash a letter, or if you want to change the setting hold the letter down, to pull her back. Some challenges are easier than others, but there will be tough ones and if you fail that gossip starts to spread. On the screen is a grade meter, which is grading Mochi on her ability to hold gossip in, and not her schoolwork. As gossip spreads that meter starts to drop, and if it hits the bottom then you fail the level.</p>


<p>In addition to avoiding trying to spread gossip, you are also trying to avoid getting stuck in a conversation with a student who just talks about themselves. This is a quick time event, where you press buttons to slowly back away from them. If you miss a hit, then you get dragged right back in again. It is pretty easy to pass this though.</p>
<p>Towards the end of the day, you run into the boss, and in this case it was The Influencer. In this run in, you enter a battle screen and it is another quick time event where you need to hit the right button at the right time. I failed and told The Influencer the gossip about her, with the game over screen informing me Mochi had been hit by the blue bag that was not from Paris. Unfortunately, you cannot reload to the start of the battle and have to restart the whole level again, but that’s something Bablabo Games could easily address.</p>
<p>Hush Hush High is a fun idea that takes a situation that many people can relate to and turns it into a game that offers a unique challenge. It captures the minefield of school, and introduces a new way to showcase a challenge to players, in this case it being gossip being the downfall. Hush Hush High is showing promise, and you can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2964000/Hush_Hush_High/">play the demo on Steam</a> to check it out too.</p>

			<p>Yesterday, Ubisoft <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-to-february-2025-ubisoft-announces-return-to-steam-on-day-1-and-departs-season-pass-model/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> that Star Wars Outlaws would be the first game to mark the company's return to Steam ahead of Assassin's Creed Shadows. The action/adventure game will be released on Valve's platform on November 21, and Massive has now <a href="https://x.com/StarWarsOutlaws/status/1838971704820801966" target="_blank" rel="noopener">revealed</a> that the first story DLC will also be available on the same date. Moreover, the team reiterated the various improvements coming to Star Wars Outlaws in a series of upcoming patches.</p>
<p><em>Outlaws, you've been roaming the Outer Rim for almost a month now, and we want to thank you again for your support! Your feedback is invaluable in helping us prioritize the improvements and changes we will make to the game. We're hard at work creating multiple title updates, which will bring optimization, gameplay polishing, and tweaks as well as quality of life changes, including adjustments to combat and stealth gameplay.</em></p>
<p><em>That's not all—our very first story pack, Star Wars Outlaws: Wild Card, will also launch on November 21st. It will see Kay and Ninx infiltrate a high-stakes Sabacc tournament, where they will face off against the legendary Lando Calrissian. In addition, new contracts will be added free for all players. For our pc players, we're also thrilled to announce that the game will be available on Steam starting November 21st. Thank you for being part of the journey and stay tuned for more updates soon.</em></p>
<p>The Wild Card DLC, just like the second DLC (A Pirate's Fortune) that will come later, is included with the Season Pass, which can be bought separately or with the Ultimate Edition of the game.</p>
<p>Between the story DLCs and the aforementioned updates, Ubisoft is hoping to position Star Wars Outlaws as a 'long-term performer' to recoup from the lower-than-expected launch sales that contributed to the company's financially underwhelming fiscal second quarter.</p>

            <p>A year and a day after wonderful <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-horror-games">horror</a> visual novel <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/slay-the-princess">Slay The Princess</a> first released, the promised Pristine Edition is arriving this October on the 24th. Like a very loud sticker on a very large bag of crisps, it promises to have “roughly 35%” more stuff in it. It’s a great game, and this sounds like the perfect time to pick it up, especially if you previously pirated it after the devs <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/piracy-preservation-and-the-devs-who-dont-mind-if-you-have-to-pirate-their-game">said they didn’t mind</a>.</p>

There are, say Black Tabby, thousands of new voice lines, over a thousand new illustrations, and 17 new music tracks. There’s also “significant glow-ups for The Fury, The Den, and the Apotheosis”, all of which have increased by around a third. There’s three new chapters with a new princess each, and there’s one new ending. There’s a “deep, interactive gallery to help you chart your progress.” Finally, there’s subtitles support for several languages, and the date also marks release on various consoles.</p>
<p>There’s also some new merch, a collector’s edition, and a celebratory livestream with Black Tabby, details of which you <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1989270/view/4661877875513622264">can find here</a>. This is the second big update they’ve put out for Slay The Princess, following an <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/slay-the-princess-endgame-is-now-bigger-and-stranger-with-more-choices-and-over-3000-words-of-new-dialogue">enriched endgame and orchestral music</a> back in March.</p>
<p>“It's one thing to construct something like this, and then another to see people experience it,” Black Tabby’s Abby Howard told me when I spoke to them last January - The Pristine Cut was directly inspired by their experience of watching how players interact with the game out in the wild.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>The first news from Tokyo Game Show 2024 is a new 11-minute gameplay video of UNDEFEATED: Genesis, a superhero action game made by the indie Japanese studio Indie-us Games. This is a sequel to 2019's free game <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1116960/UNDEFEATED/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">UNDEFEATED</a>, which was made by three studio members when they were still students.</p>
<p>Developed with Unreal Engine 5, UNDEFEATED: Genesis is planned to be the first entry in a trilogy. Here's the brief synopsis and overview provided by Indie-us Games:</p>
<p><em>You are an ordinary college student living an unremarkable life when you are struck by a meteor. You wake up on a mysterious planet where you discover you have been endowed with incredible powers.</em></p>
<p><em>This planet was once home to a civilization far more advanced than Earth's, but centuries earlier, a massive explosion devastated it and left it plagued by destructive mutants. Now, you must stand up for the remaining survivors and use your awesome powers to rid the planet of its violent and catastrophic blight.</em></p>

<p>If you're attending Tokyo Game Show 2024, the developer has also brought a public demo that anyone can try by heading to the Chorus Worldwide booth in the TGS Indie Corner.</p>
<p>UNDEFEATED: Genesis is currently targeting a 2026 release window for PC (<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2088020/UNDEFEATED_Genesis/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam</a>) and <a href="https://store.playstation.com/concept/10011831/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PlayStation 5</a>. Chances are we won't be getting any Superman games before that date, although maybe Monolith Productions will have released its <a href="https://wccftech.com/wonder-woman-single-player-open-world-game-in-development-at-monolith-will-use-the-nemesis-system/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wonder Woman game</a>.</p>

			<p>The new <a href="https://www.meta.com/quest/quest-3s/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Meta Quest 3S</a> VR/MR device was the star of Meta Connect 2024. It will launch on October 15 and be priced at $299 for the 128GB version or $399 for the 256GB version.</p>
<p>The Meta Quest 3S offers the same Snapdragon XR2 Gen 2 chipset as the Meta Quest 3, so its performance is essentially identical. However, there are some minor differences. Beyond the lower storage (the Meta Quest 3 has 512GB), the new 3S also has a slightly lower field of view (between 89 and 96 degrees, compared to the 110 degrees of the MQ3); it uses the Quest 2's fresnel lenses instead of the pancake ones from the MQ3 (making it quite a bit thicker; it has a single display LCD instead of a dual LCD, and it lacks a headphone jack. On the plus side, the reported average battery life is 2.5 hours, which is more than the Meta Quest 3's 2.2 hours.</p>
<p>The 3S is compatible with most existing accessories, such as Elite Straps and carrying cases. However, it is incompatible with the Charging Dock, so it needs a new Compact Charging Dock.</p>
<p><iframe title="Introducing Meta Quest 3S" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/oAf5M4Q0Pu8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Do note that the Meta Quest 3 is also getting a price drop from $649 to $499, while sales of the Quest 2 and Quest Pro are being discontinued. All Meta Quest 3 purchases made between now and April 30, 2025 at 5 PM Pacific Time will be eligible for a free copy of <a href="https://wccftech.com/batman-arkham-shadow-is-an-exclusive-meta-quest-3-vr-game/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Batman: Arkham Shadow</a>, the prequel in development at Camouflaj and due to launch on October 22. Additionally, Meta is gifting three months of Meta Quest + subscription, which includes access to several VR games.</p>

<p>Other big VR games shown at Meta Connect 2024 include <a href="https://wccftech.com/metro-awakening-vr-announced-for-psvr2-launches-november-7/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Metro: Awakening</a>, which is out on November 7 for PS VR2, Meta Quest 3 family, and Steam VR, and <a href="https://www.meta.com/en-gb/experiences/skydances-behemoth/5767635983306831/?intern_source=blog&amp;intern_content=meta-connect-2024-content-recap" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Skydance’s BEHEMOTH</a>, the new fantasy action/adventure game from the makers of The Walking Dead: Saints &amp; Sinners. BEHEMOTH is scheduled to launch on December 5.</p>
