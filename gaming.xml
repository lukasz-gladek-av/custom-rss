            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pacific-drive-endless-expeditions-update<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer Ironwood Studios and publisher Kepler Interactive have released a new&nbsp;<em>Pacific Drive&nbsp;</em>update, and this one's ideal if you thought the base game wasn't quite roguelite enough.</p>

<p>The Endless Expeditions update is the latest in a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pacific-drive-update-customization" rel="nofollow">string</a> of post-launch&nbsp;<em>Pacific Drive&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pacific-drive-sales-update" rel="nofollow">updates</a>, and its main feature is its namesake, the Expeditions mode, which Ironwood describes as offering "roguelite-style trips with unique routes and restrictions".</p>

<p>You'll start out from your garage "with an ever-changing set of challenges and restrictions", so if you feel like you've already seen everything&nbsp;<em>Pacific Drive&nbsp;</em>has to offer, this update may give you pause for thought on that front.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pacific-drive-endless-expeditions-update-map.jpg?itok=OqAkxLnn 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pacific-drive-endless-expeditions-update-map.jpg?itok=ZQGC8PdZ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Pacific Drive</em>'s Endless Expeditions update should give you a few new challenges if you're a roguelite fan.</figcaption></figure><p>This update also introduces the ability to suspend your game no matter where you are, so you can suspend an in-progress run if you've got something else more urgent to do.</p>

<p>Additionally, you can look forward to "over an hour" of new radio music spread across 21 songs, created by "new and returning artists", as well as upgrades to the Plasma Scrapper and Thermal Vacuum tools to make them more efficient.</p>

<p>The new Ida's Exchange vendor will let you purchase new unique parts and resources for your car, as well as cosmetics to make it look a little nicer, and the route planning UI has been refreshed "for better readability" too.</p>

<p>If you want to know more about the Expeditions mode, be sure to keep an eye on Ironwood's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@ironwoodstudios/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">YouTube channel</a>, where the developer will be releasing an in-depth look at the mode in the coming days.</p>




<p>If you're unfamiliar with&nbsp;<em>Pacific Drive</em>, it's a survival-based driving game in which you must uncover the mysteries of a&nbsp;<em>Stalker</em>-style exclusion zone racked with anomalies and other dangers.</p>

<p>The game is available right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1458140/Pacific_Drive/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a> and <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/pacific-drive/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, as is the Endless Expeditions update.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/interviews/assassins-creed-shadows-actress-masumi-on-naoe-challenges-of-acting-in-games<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/assassins-creed-shadows-story-attempting-to-hit-word-limit" rel="nofollow"><em>Assassin's Creed Shadows</em></a> often feels like two games in one. If you play as Yasuke, you'll mow down enemies like an indestructible tank. If you play as Naoe, you'll dance in the shadows, elegantly carving a path toward your goal.&nbsp;</p>

<p>They're opposites in so many ways. Yasuke is a gentle giant with strong convictions, while Naoe's petite stature contains a wealth of rage and fury. Over time, she hones this storm of emotions into a sharp blade, focused squarely on restoring freedom to Japan.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The actress behind this performance? Masumi, a Japanese American who previously starred in Netflix's <em>Yakuza Princess</em>. We interviewed her about her first major role in a AAA video game, where we learned about all the skills she brought to <em>Assassin's Creed Shadows</em>.</p>



<h2>A Deep Dive Into Naoe's Traumas</h2>

<p>Players who have seen the moment where Naoe and Yasuke meet know about her initial character arc. She goes from grief to greatness, and in Masumi's words, Naoe finds her "true power in her own shadows."&nbsp;</p>

<p>"All of the knowledge, skills, and wisdom that are passed down to her becomes almost like a curse because she doesn't know how to control her shadows made of trauma, anger, and pain," she said. "This story is about Naoe overcoming her inner demons and harnessing the true power of the shadows."&nbsp;</p>

<p>Naoe and Yasuke initially meet in an awkward position, but as Masumi puts it, they go from "enemies to lifelong friends." At first, they rely on each other because of their different talents, but throughout the game, you see more tender moments between them. These moments are courtesy of the acting work of Masumi and Tongayi Chirisa, who plays Yasuke.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Working with him was a treat! It didn't feel like work because we had so much fun working together," Masumi said about her fellow protagonist. "I respect him so much as an actor and a senpai as well, so I got to learn a lot from working with him."&nbsp;</p>

<p>Personally, I found that Yasuke brings out the best in Naoe, breaking down her trauma-built barriers with kindness. It adds emotional complexity to her character, which Masumi really related to.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"I love how she takes in the moments of beauty when she notices them and lets the moments of sadness sink in when they come," she said. "She can be cool and calm like a ninja, or rage fiercely like a warrior! All while being the petite size that she is."</p>



<h2>The Hard Parts of Acting in a Video Game</h2>

<p>Masumi's previous experience on <em>Yakuza Princess</em> prepared her well for <em>Assassin's Creed Shadows</em>. She had training in Japanese sword fighting with actor Masa Kanome in LA because of the movie, and it came in handy for her role as Naoe.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"We practice coming up with a fight choreography within 5 minutes at the end of every class. We have to quickly memorize all the choreography parts and tape it," she said. "So that skill definitely helped me book the job and also add some movements to Naoe in the game."&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>Assassin's Creed Shadows</em> presented Masumi with her first opportunities at motion capture and performance capture, both of which are common ways to record human movement and acting for games. In fact, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/features/obstacles-animal-motion-capture-video-game-development" rel="nofollow">these techniques can be used for animals</a>, too!&nbsp;</p>

<p>You've probably seen behind-the-scenes videos of people doing this in skin-tight body suits, often with markings for the cameras to track them. Needless to say, it's not the most immersive setting for an actor to perform in.</p>

<p>"You really have to tap into your imagination and trust your body to bring the character to life," Masumi said about the challenges of motion capture. "I also needed to ask questions about the weight or texture of the 'door' that I might be opening in a scene, to make it real for myself!"</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"As challenging as it was, it was also a rewarding experience. I learned so much." —Masumi, actress</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Nonetheless, motion capture still lets a person act with their entire body. With voiceovers though, all the perceived "output" comes through only in voice.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"You have to convey everything through tone, breath, and energy. And because it’s a game, you’re not always recording in sequence, which means finding the right emotional beats without the full context," she said. "I have such renewed respect for VO actors after being on this project!"&nbsp;</p>

<p>Overall, this wasn't an easy experience, especially with the volume of work that goes into acting in a video game. Story aside, actors have to record a lot of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/interview/video-game-grunts-groans-and-screams-j-b-blanc-sheds-light-on-voice-acting" rel="nofollow">yelps and hints, along with combat grunts</a> and side quest musings.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"It was a 'marathon' as [creative director] Jonathan Dumont advised me in the beginning. I've learned a lot about advocating for recovery time and taking care of myself," she said. "But honestly, as challenging as it was, it was also a rewarding experience. I learned so much."</p>



<h2>A Sense of Pride</h2>

<p>Masumi herself doesn't play too many video games, but she did check out some of <em>Assassin's Creed Shadows</em> recently—I mean, why wouldn't she, after all that hard work?&nbsp;</p>

<p>"While it was beautiful and super exciting to watch Naoe and Yasuke's story, the fight scenes were a bit too violent for me to get through," she said with a laugh. "I can't watch bloody horror movies either, so I would just have to enjoy walking through the town with <em>Shadows</em>."&nbsp;</p>

<p>Still, there's a lot she should be proud of. <em>Assassin's Creed Shadows</em> is arguably one of the best in the franchise, with a healthy player base that has grown a lot since release. Additionally, it adds an extra sense of weight and honor to Masumi, being part of a game that showcases parts of Japanese history and culture.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"I feel so honored and grateful that people are interested in our culture," she said. "I hope this will entice people to come to Japan and explore the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/features/real-wabi-sabi-in-assassins-creed-shadows-open-world" rel="nofollow">beautiful cities and countrysides in Japan</a>!"&nbsp;</p>

            <p>The Last of Us Part 2 made its PC debut just yesterday, but already the game has been cracked.</p>
<p>As spotted by <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/the-last-of-us-part-2-pc-steam-playstation-cracked/">The Gamer</a>, video game pirates have found a way to get the game off Steam - its legitimate PC storefront - for torrenting, less than 24 hours since its release. Posts on social media reveal that the game is available from unofficial sources.</p>

</figure>
<p>This means that while The Last of Us Part 2 Remastered itself has 15,885 players on Steam at the time of writing, there are likely some players elsewhere given its unofficial PC availability - though it's hard to tell how much pirating has impacted sales so far.</p>
<p>The Last of Us 2 Remastered <a href="https://steamdb.info/charts/?compare=1888930,2531310">currently has a concurrent player peak of 23,350</a> on Valve's platform. To compare, The Last of Us Part 1 - which was released on PC in 2023, in a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/naughty-dog-knows-the-last-of-us-part-1-on-pc-hasnt-delivered-the-naughty-dog-quality-you-expected">rather sorry state</a> - has a Steam concurrent player peak of 36,496.</p>
<p>Digital Foundry took The Last of Us Part 2 out for a spin on PC ahead of its release. "It's a better game on launch than Part 1, but with some frustrating elements and a buggy feeling that's hard to shake," <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-the-last-of-us-part-2-a-better-pc-port-but-not-a-great-one">Alex Battaglia wrote following his time with The Last of Us Part 2 Remastered on PC</a>.</p>
<p>"Beyond the disappointingly high GPU requirements, the biggest complaint here are the frame-time spikes that occur even on high-end kit, which seems incongruous with the game's cinematic presentation."</p>
<p>Still, it doesn't look like any of Part 2's issues are going to get memed in the same way <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-many-pc-glitches-are-being-turned-into-memes">The Last of Us Part 1 did on its own PC release</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/inzoi-sales-1m<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Krafton's&nbsp;<em>Sims</em>-style life sim&nbsp;<em>inZoi&nbsp;</em>has reached a major sales milestone just a week after its initial launch in Early Access.</p>

<p><em>inZoi&nbsp;</em>was released last Friday, having been <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/inzoi-release-date-delayed" rel="nofollow">delayed out of 2024 back in November</a>, and according to a <a href="https://x.com/PlayinZOI/status/1908082411906449478" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on the game's official X account, it's already surpassed a million sales, a number Krafton says "feels unreal".</p>

<p>The developer thanks players who've bought the game so far, praising their "excitement", their fan creations, and the feedback they've provided so far, as well as the support they've given to <i>inZoi</i>. Krafton says it's "deeply grateful" for fans' "passion and love".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/inzoi-sales-1m-crowd.jpg?itok=wsCHYmbr 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/inzoi-sales-1m-crowd.jpg?itok=h21Jwf4j 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Krafton's&nbsp;<em>inZoi&nbsp;</em>has already reached a million sales.</figcaption></figure><p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>inZoi</em>, it's a life sim in the vein of games like EA's&nbsp;<em>The Sims</em>&nbsp;and...well...just&nbsp;<em>The Sims</em>, really. EA's franchise hasn't had much competition of late, and the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/life-by-you-paradoxs-sims-competitor-has-been-cancelled" rel="nofollow">cancellation of Paradox's&nbsp;</a><em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/life-by-you-paradoxs-sims-competitor-has-been-cancelled" rel="nofollow">Life by You</a>&nbsp;</em>didn't help on that front.</p>

<p>Krafton describes&nbsp;<em>inZoi&nbsp;</em>as "a fully functional community simulation experience" in which your role is to "shap[e] the world as [you] envision and [witness] the various stories that unfold".</p>

<p><em>inZoi</em>'s characters, known as Zois, will go about their lives according to their own whims, but you can shape their experience by altering their environment, and, of course, by <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sims-like-inzoi-character-creator-tool" rel="nofollow">customizing them</a> to your heart's content as well.</p>

<p>Today's sales milestone arguably shows not only that there's a real appetite for&nbsp;<em>Sims</em>-style experiences outside of EA's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ea-no-plans-the-sims-5" rel="nofollow">rather restrictive playpen</a>, but also that the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/krafton-generative-ai-characters-pubg-inzoi" rel="nofollow">presence of generative AI</a>, which Krafton has been talking up in&nbsp;<em>inZoi&nbsp;</em>for a while, hasn't hindered the game's popularity.</p>




<p>Unlike&nbsp;<em>The Sims</em>,&nbsp;<em>inZoi&nbsp;</em>is currently in Early Access, and Krafton <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2456740/view/512953841353754380" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">says</a> it has plans to introduce major updates for the game around every two months, although more pressing issues will be fixed on a more immediate basis "during April".</p>

<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>inZoi&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2456740/inZOI/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC via Steam</a>.</p>

		<p>It’s been far too long since Donkey Kong’s last 3D adventure, but Donkey Kong Bananza is about to set that right on Nintendo Switch 2. This is a big, brash, counterpart to Mario Odyssey, a smash-happy 3D platformer where it feels like anything and everything can be destroyed.</p>
<p><iframe title="Donkey Kong Bananza – Nintendo Direct | Nintendo Switch 2" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mIddsPkdX9U?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Playing through the opening stage of the game, we find DK down in the mines with all his simian pals, digging up gold nuggets while hunting for surprisingly tasty jewel-encrusted golden bananas to smash and gobble up. While everyone else is toiling away with pick axes, though, DK can just punch his way through the deformable scenery.</p>


<p>You know exactly what kind of game this is when you’ve got three different face buttons all dedicated to smashing in different ways. One will smash around you, another with punch down, and finally, you can punch upwards. Whether it’s enemies or deformable parts of the world, a lot of the time, things will just hurry up and get out of DK’s way when he punches.</p>
<p>It feels like something inspired by the likes of Red Faction or Deep Rock Galactic as you barrel your way through this opening stage, and there’s an initial thrill to the rambunctious chaos that you create in your surroundings. It doesn’t take too long to start to find the limits of what you can punch your way through, this underground level still having plenty of deformable terrain, but also unbreakable walls and floors boxing you in to keep things a little constrained – this underlying structure will ensure that you can’t get stuck.</p>

<p>Another of DK’s abilities is slapping the ground, both to trigger hidden elements on the floor to raise up – platforms, for example –&nbsp;and do a quick little sonar pulse to reveal nearby secrets hidden away in the dirt.</p>

<p>Jumping ahead to a later level at Ape Cape –&nbsp;after DK finds a huge haul of golden bananas, just in time for the villains to turn up and steal them all away, of course –&nbsp;and we’re out in the open and the bright sun. There’s some enemies you can’t actually smash here, flying Buzzoids that will damage you with their blade-like propeller if you get too close. Luckily you can just rip up big chunks of the ground and throw them at things that have offended you.</p>
<p>That can also include enemies that have encased themselves in rock and other matter, needing you to throw chunks of rock at them, or punch your way through to their skeletal forms inside before you can defeat them. They were featured in a mini battle arena, a little diversion from the main level as you fight multiple enemies against the clock. A longside fossils, buried treasure chest and other secrets,</p>
<p>Sometimes not even throwing ripped up rocks will do the trick – concrete is pretty much impervious to your regular attacks. That’s where the handy, shimmering purple explosive rocks come into play, sprouting from certain parts of the level. These are great for just blasting holes in the level and through heavier enemies, exploding on impact and doing a lot of damage. After going through a section of revolving concrete and finding it thoroughly unpunchable, I doubled back, grabbed some purple and embraced the TNT excavation technique of old.</p>

<p>The one problem with all the dig-punching is that it feels like the camera is a bit too close or not quite framed to DK to capture the world-smashing carnage you’re unleashing. It’s entirely possible to get a little bit lost in all the smashing and get turned around, especially when you’re in the tighter confines of the underground mine level. A neat trick that does work to keep you oriented, is when the camera can clip through the ground as you dig straight down and let you see the rest of the level, so you know where to dig towards to get yourself back out. I hope that longer play gets past this feeling, or that it can be tweaked through the final rounds of polish before release.</p>
<p>The game does look good, though. DK has that newer character style, similar to his appearance in the Super Mario Movie and in Mario Kart World, but still turns up to work in dungarees and a tie. That particular get up changed for the second level, and there’s bound to be plenty of costumes and dress up through the game.</p>
<p>There is quite a chunky feel to the deformation, but it’s good to see that even where you can’t dig through, say, the ape-shaped mountain of the second level, your punching does still often disturb a surface layer and give a little bit of visible, physical feedback.</p>

<p>If your kids are fans of Hulk smashing his way through earlier Avengers movies, then they’ll probably go bananas for Donkey Kong Bananza. As Nintendo and their partners explore platformers in all their forms, there’s some neat ideas built around the frenzy of punching and adding deformable world to the genre. I look forward to seeing how this can be explored in different ways, to hopefully avoid DK becoming a one punch ape.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/xbox-game-pass-2-billion-year-revenue/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>While there was some skepticism surrounding the Xbox Game Pass when it launched in 2017, players embraced the subscription model, which has been making solid revenue in the past few years.</p>
<p>As spotted by Timur222 on X, Richie Choudhary, former Head of Product at Xbox, revealed on their <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/richie-choudhary/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LinkedIn profile</a> that from 2019 until 2021, Xbox Game Pass stood at $2 billion a year in revenue, which is definitely an impressive figure, despite not being telling in regard to the sustainability of the subscription service, as there's no data on the profits.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Old but interesting<br>
Xbox Game Pass used to make $2 billion a year in revenue<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Xbox?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Xbox</a> <a href="https://t.co/N5VEc0EBjH">pic.twitter.com/N5VEc0EBjH</a></p>
<p>— Timur222 (@bogorad222) <a href="https://twitter.com/bogorad222/status/1908089661349576714?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 4, 2025</a></p></blockquote>

<p>While Xbox Game Pass delivers quite a bit of value to players, it definitely causes a considerable drop in sales. <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-game-pass-games-lose-80-sales/">Earlier this year</a>, it was revealed that any game that is available as part of the subscription service's library can be expected to lose around 80% of its expected premium sales on Xbox, a little less if it is a big mainstream release. Still, certain games benefit from being part of the Game Pass library, such as multiplayer games, as a surge of players on Xbox systems can have a positive impact on sales on PlayStation consoles. The service also makes it easier for some developers to get players to try out their games.</p>
<p>Xbox Game Pass has become a fundamental part of Microsoft's strategy in the gaming space, which aims to get as many players as possible into the Xbox ecosystem, no matter the device. You can learn more about the subscription service on its <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-game-pass" target="_blank" rel="noopener">official website.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/bungie-reportedly-gearing-up-for-marathon-reveal-later-this-month/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>A reliable insider has claimed that Marathon might receive some sort of reveal next week.</p>



<p>Bungie recently <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marathon-news-being-teased-by-bungie/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">teased</a> Marathon on its social media accounts, hinting at a potential reveal in the coming days. Interestingly, Jeff Grubb also spoke about this topic during the latest episode of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_7BU-Y6wdI" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Game Mess Decides</a> (via <a href="https://thegamepost.com/bungie-to-reveal-more-about-marathon-late-next-week/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">TheGamePost</a>). Grubb has stated that “late next week”, players will be able to finally learn “a lot more about Marathon”.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This is not Grubb’s first mention of an April reveal for Marathon. A few months ago, he stated that Marathon wasn’t a part of PlayStation’s State of Play event as it probably has its own thing because that’s how Bungie operates for Destiny, too. Grubb <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/why-bungies-marathon-wasnt-at-state-of-play/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">added</a>, “I think April [is] when we will probably hear from them about Marathon. And it would be its own thing separate from the State of Play.”</p>



<p>Bungie’s Marathon has been under wraps since its reveal at the PlayStation Showcase event. Since then, the only update we have received was a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/bungie-gives-official-update-on-status-of-marathon/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">dev talk</a> from the game director. However, we only heard about what was in the works in the game, along with some concept art for upcoming heroes. No actual gameplay was shown. If Marathon is revealed late next week, players will hope that the developers show up with a bunch of gameplay.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other news, Bungie’s Marathon <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/bungie-marathon-steam/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pre-order bonuses</a> were recently spotted on Steam. Also, according to claims, the dev’s upcoming ‘<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/bungies-upcoming-gummy-bears-moba-is-inspired-by-smash-bros-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gummy Bears’ MOBA</a> is inspired by Smash Bros. What are your thoughts on the Marathon being revealed later this month?

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/is-titanfall-3-in-development-new-rumors-suggest-a-2026-release-date.1155204/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/titanfall-3-2026-rumor/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>New rumors have surfaced that Titanfall 3 is in development and could be revealed in later this year with a 2026 release date.</p>



<p>It’s almost tradition at this point that a new Titanfall 3 rumor needs to surface annually, and this time, it suggests that the game is in development and could be revealed at this year’s The Game Awards, with a release date of 2026.</p>



<p>The recent rumours originate from two different Titanfall leakers, who, at face value, have got decent track records when it comes to reporting Apex Legends and Titanfall news.</p>



<p>Leaker,&nbsp;<a href="https://x.com/YOROTSUKI_" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">YOROTSUKI_</a>, was the first to make the claim and that back in December 2024, they teased in some discord servers that Respawn was working on a new game. Another Apex Legends leaker by the name of <a href="https://x.com/Osvaldatore" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Osvaldatore</a> then went on to corroborate the rumor with a tweet of a Titanfall 3 logo and had apparently spoken to YOROTSUKI being the scenes to verify that the game is indeed in development.</p>



<p>As for if the rumors are true or not remains to be seen (as always, take with a pinch of salt), but in the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@insider_gaming/videos" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Insider Gaming podcast</a> (released later today), we discuss the possibilities of the information being real and what we’ve heard. </p>



<p>According to our sources, Titanfall 3 has already been cancelled and shut down at least twice, with one of the reasons being given is because the game was “too similar to Titanfall 2”. That being said, Respawn Entertainment has had several unannounced projects cancelled in the past year, and probably needs another huge title other than Star Wars Jedi as the Apex Legends playerbase continues to dwindle. </p>



<p>As far as we know, at least three unannounced projects have been cancelled at Respawn in the past year, one was a single-player first-person shooter set in the Apex Legends universe, a second was a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/star-wars-mandalorian-game-canceled/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">single-player Mandalorian game</a>, and a third was an unannounced incubation project.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming has reached out to EA for comment and have contacted sources to see if the rumor has any legs.</p>



<p>Do you think Titanfall 3 is in development? Let me know in the comments or on the&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

This isn't the case for Cyberpunk 2077, though.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For context, one of the biggest games on the original Switch, The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, was just 16 GB.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s worth noting that the GameCube app’s size is expected to grow as new games are added to the library. At launch, the GameCube app contains The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker, F-Zero GX, and SoulCalibur 2.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Nintendo Switch 2 Game Boxes</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">So, how is the Nintendo Switch 2 able to get away with relatively small game sizes while offering up to 4K resolution?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In January, the internet spotted a Nintendo patent, filed July 2023 but published for the first time earlier this year, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-leaks-ramp-up-as-new-patent-suggests-ai-image-upscaling-tech"><u>that described AI image upscaling technology</u></a> that would help keep video game download sizes small enough to fit on a physical game cartridge while offering up to 4K textures. It was thought at the time that this applied to the Nintendo Switch 2, and could relate to Nvidia DLSS graphics technology.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Nvidia DLSS (Deep Learning Super Sampling) is an AI-powered technology that uses machine learning to upscale lower-resolution images in real-time, enhancing both performance and image quality in games.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This week, in the wake of the Nintendo Direct, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nvidia-says-its-custom-gpu-means-nintendo-switch-2-has-10x-the-graphics-performance-of-the-nintendo-switch">Nintendo and Nvidia confirmed the Switch 2’s custom GPU enables AI upscaling via DLSS and ray tracing</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Nvidia described it as a “custom Nvidia processor featuring an Nvidia GPU with dedicated RT Cores and Tensor Cores for stunning visuals and AI-driven enhancements.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Those upgrades include up to 4K gaming in TV mode and up to 120 FPS at 1080p in handheld mode. Nintendo Switch 2 also supports HDR, and AI upscaling “to sharpen visuals and smooth gameplay.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The new RT Cores bring real-time ray tracing, delivering “lifelike lighting, reflections and shadows for more immersive worlds,” Nvidia continued.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Tensor Cores, meanwhile, power AI-driven features like DLSS, “boosting resolution for sharper details without sacrificing image quality.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Details are thin on the ground, however. In a hardware-focused roundtable Q&amp;A in New York this week, attended by IGN, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-confirms-switch-2-uses-dlss-and-ray-tracing-but-is-being-super-vague-about-the-details"><u>Nintendo representatives confirmed the Switch 2 uses DLSS</u></a>, but did not specify which version of the tech, or whether it had been customized for Switch 2. It was a similarly vague response when Nintendo confirmed the Switch 2’s GPU is capable of ray tracing.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And what about the GPU itself? Tetsuya Sasaki, General Manager at Nintendo’s Technology Development Division, and Senior Director at its Technology Development Department, chimed in to say Nintendo prefers not to get in the weeds on things like the GPU.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Nintendo doesn't share too much on the hardware spec,” he said. “What we really like to focus on is the value that we can provide to our consumers. But I do believe that our partner Nvidia will be sharing some information.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For more, check out <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-direct-everything-announced"><u>everything announced at the Switch 2 Nintendo Direct</u></a>, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/heres-why-the-nintendo-switch-2-mario-kart-world-and-everything-around-them-is-so-expensive"><u>what the experts have to say about the Switch 2 price and Mario Kart World’s $80 price tag</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/bungies-marathon-finally-emerges-from-the-shadows-to-tease-something<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Remember <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/marathon">Marathon</a>? It’s Destiny developer Bungie’s next game, and it looks like we’re about to finally see more of it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Marathon is a PvP-focused extraction shooter set on the mysterious planet of Tau Ceti IV. Players inhabit the bodies of Runners, cybernetic mercenaries who have been designed to survive the planet’s harsh environments, exploring the lost colony that once inhabited Tau Ceti’s surface.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It has been some time since we saw or heard of Marathon. In October, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bungie-shooter-marathon-is-on-track-but-too-early-in-development-to-show">Bungie released a lengthy development update <u>video</u> that shed light on Marathon's mechanics</a>, but stressed how early in development the game was. Player character models were, at that point, still "coming together," while enemy models were still in an "early state."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Now, though, half a year later, it looks like Bungie is finally ready to reveal what it’s been working on. A tweet from the official Marathon account, below, revealed a typically cryptic image and accompanying garbled signal noise. As fans have noticed, there’s ASCII art of footage from the debut Marathon trailer. Given this is Bungie we’re talking about, a developer known for its mysterious teasers, hidden clues, and Easter eggs, there’s probably much more here to discover, and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Marathon/comments/1jr6otv/unencrypted_code/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">fans are already working to find out what it all means</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Either way, it very much looks like it’s finally happening for Marathon after what has been a troubled development.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="zxx" dir="ltr"><a href="https://t.co/6NBgIdRVK2" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/6NBgIdRVK2</a></p>— Marathon (@MarathonTheGame) <a href="https://twitter.com/MarathonTheGame/status/1907956872046690602?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">April 4, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bungie-reveals-new-marathon-game-at-playstation-showcase"><u>Marathon was revealed in May 2023</u></a> as a reboot of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/4-ways-marathon-influenced-modern-games"><u>the classic Bungie franchise</u></a>, but with all its themes of "mysteries, eeriness, and psychological creepiness." But Bungie itself has suffered several controversies in recent years, headlined by <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/destiny-developer-bungie-cuts-220-staff-some-of-the-most-difficult-changes-weve-ever-had-to-make-as-a-studio"><u>the laying off of 220 staff members</u></a>, meaning 17% of its workforce, in July 2024: <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/games-industry-criticizes-bungie-management-ceo-pete-parsons-in-wake-of-layoffs-inexcusable"><u>a move even industry peers criticized</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This came <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pete-parsons-tells-employees-bungie-kept-the-right-people-to-work-on-destiny-2"><u>less than a year after 100 other layoffs at Bungie</u></a>, at which point <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bungie-devs-say-atmosphere-is-soul-crushing-amid-layoffs-cuts-and-fear-of-total-sony-takeover"><u>staff told IGN the atmosphere was "soul crushing" at the studio</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Further controversy came when a report released weeks after the 220 job losses alleging <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/marathon-director-was-fired-following-misconduct-investigation-at-bungie-report"><u>former Marathon director Chris Barrett was fired after an internal misconduct investigation</u></a> at Bungie. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/former-bungie-director-chris-barrett-suing-sony-interactive-entertainment-and-bungie-for-more-than-200-million">Barrett subsequently sued Sony Interactive Entertainment and Bungie for more than $200 million</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This all comes as Sony rethinks its focus on live-service games. Sony president Hiroki Totoki said in November 2023 <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-commits-to-launch-just-six-of-playstations-12-live-service-games-by-march-2026"><u>the company was committed to launching just six of the 12 live service games it was working on</u></a> by March 2026, in a shift in strategy that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-last-of-us-multiplayer-game-cancelled-will-focus-on-single-player-games-going-forward"><u>saw The Last of Us multiplayer game cancelled</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While Arrowhead’s Helldivers 2 was a breakout hit, becoming the fastest-selling PlayStation Studios game of all time with 12 million copies sold in just 12 weeks, Sony’s other live service games were either canceled or suffered disastrous launches.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Indeed, Sony’s Concord is one of the biggest video game disasters in PlayStation history, lasting just a couple of weeks before it was brought offline amid eye-wateringly low player numbers. Sony later decided to kill the game entirely and shut its developer.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And earlier this year, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/playstation-cancels-two-unannounced-live-service-games"><u>Sony reportedly canceled two unannounced live service games</u></a>, one a God of War title in development at Bluepoint, the other in the works at Days Gone developer Bend.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

"Whether or not the software developer is going to use that as a native resolution or get it to a smaller res and then upscale is something that the software developer can choose. I think it opens up a lot of options for the software developer."</p><p>In the same session, Dohta confirmed that the Switch 2's GPU will support ray tracing, which "provides another option for software developers to use."</p><p>More details about the tech upgrades were revealed in a <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/nintendo-switch-2-leveled-up-with-nvidia-ai-powered-dlss-and-4k-gaming/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Nvidia blog post</a>, which provided a deep dive on the Switch 2's custom Nvidia processor. The console's GPU boasts dedicated RT Cores to power real-time ray tracing, while Tensor Cores are used for AI-powered boosts like DLSS upscaling. The Switch 2's AI processing also comes into play with the console's new video-chat feature, with AI-powered features including face tracking and automatic background removal.</p><p>Overall, Nvidia said the Switch 2 has 10 times the graphical performance of the Nintendo Switch, giving developers more to work with when developing games for the new console. Nintendo also announced during the Switch 2 Direct that the new console will support <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-will-support-hdr-4k-and-120fps/1100-6530547/" data-ref-id="1100-6530547">HDR, 4K, and 120fps</a>.</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-launches-june-5/1100-6530537/" data-ref-id="1100-6530537">Nintendo Switch 2 will launch on June 5</a> for $450, with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-preorder-guide-mario-kart-world-bundle/1100-6530531/" data-ref-id="1100-6530531">preorders beginning on April 9</a>.</p>

            <p>Nintendo's upcoming Switch 2 console doesn't actually run the original Switch's games natively, as the two hardwares are incompatible.</p>
<p>One of the first things that we knew for absolute certain about the Switch successor was that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-confirms-backwards-compatibility-for-switch-2">it would be backwards compatible</a>. "At today's Corporate Management Policy Briefing, we announced that Nintendo Switch software will also be playable on the successor to Nintendo Switch," company president Shuntaro Furukawa said in November.</p>
<p>But, while this means Switch 2 owners will still be able to play most of the games from the original Switch's library, this isn't possible because the two consoles are compatible at a hardware level, which would have been handy. Rather, it's all possible thanks to a workaround Nintendo has managed to implement.</p>

<p>During a recent <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/whatsnew/ask-the-developer-vol-16-nintendo-switch-2-part-4/">Ask the Developer Q&amp;A</a>, Nintendo's Kouichi Kawamoto said the Switch 2 team always wanted the new system to play the original console's games, but "were told there'd be technical challenges" getting it to work.</p>
<p>"When we first started Switch 2 development, the focus was on enhancing its performance as hardware, namely, expanding its capacity," added Takuhiro Dohta. "So, compatibility was a lower priority."</p>
<p>But, it was still something the team wanted to ensure, and in the end the Switch 2 developers settled on "the challenge of using new technology to run Switch games".</p>
<p>Said Dohta: "If we tried to use technology like software emulators, we'd have to run Switch 2 at full capacity, but that would mean the battery wouldn't last so long, so we did something that’s somewhere in between a software emulator and hardware compatibility."</p>
<p>The team goes through many checks to make sure original Switch games run smoothly on Switch 2, but the developers noted "it might not be that all Switch games run perfectly" in time for the console's launch this summer.</p>
<p>This method of playing older games <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnite-and-other-games-have-compatibility-issues-with-switch-2">explains why a few titles have some compatibility issues</a>, though fixes are in the works. And while only one Switch game is completely unplayable on Switch 2, others will still require the use of original Joy-Con due to specific controls or peripherals.</p>
<p>"But we will continue our efforts so that we can support as many Switch games as possible," Kawamoto said.</p>

			<p>The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion remake is still scheduled to be revealed and released this month, according to an extremely reliable insider.</p>
<p>A few hours ago, extremely reliable insider NateTheHate replied to a question regarding the remake, which was <a href="https://wccftech.com/oblivion-remake-could-be-mere-days-from-launch-according-to-leaker/">rumored</a> to launch yesterday, confirming that, as things stand, the game will still be released this month. Plans can obviously change, but with the insider's track record, it is safe to say that chances are high that we will soon be able to return to Cyrodiil soon, and experience it like we never did before.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">As things stand, yes.</p>
<p>— NateTheHate2 (@NateTheHate2) <a href="https://twitter.com/NateTheHate2/status/1907919010387370215?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 3, 2025</a></p></blockquote>

<p>While The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion remake has yet to be officially announced, we have known it has been in development in some capacity for <a href="https://wccftech.com/oblivion-fallout-3-remasters-leaked-alongside-dishonored-3-ghostwire-tokyo-sequel-and-more/">almost two years</a>, when the game's existence was revealed in an FTC investigational hearing held with Xbox's head Phil Spencer. According to <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remake-rumors-intensify-as-details-on-the-improvements-emerge-in-new-report/">rumors,</a> the remake is being developed by Virtuos in <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remake-unreal-engine-5/">Unreal Engine 5</a> and will feature many new features and improvements over the original, including combat mechanics changes, some of them inspired by modern action games, HUD improvements, and more. If all of these changes will indeed be implemented in the final game, they should make for a far more enjoyable experience.</p>
<p>Those who haven't experienced The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion ahead of the remake still have the chance to do so on PC, as the GOTY edition, including all additional content, is now available on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/22330/The_Elder_Scrolls_IV_Oblivion_Game_of_the_Year_Edition/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam</a>. Console players, unfortunately, have no other option at the moment other than playing the game on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.</p>

<p>Krafton has announced that inZOI has passed 1 million units sold in its first week of launch in early access on Steam.</p>



<p>In a press release, it was also said that “Canvas,”&nbsp;inZOI’s in-game UGC (User-generated Content) sharing platform, showed strong levels of community engagement as it garnered more than 1.2 million players on the day of launch with over 470,000 pieces of uploaded content.</p>



<p>CEO CH Kim stated, “We are grateful and excited to present&nbsp;inZOI&nbsp;to players around the world through Early Access,” adding, “We will continue to actively communicate with players and foster&nbsp;inZOI&nbsp;as KRAFTON’s long-term franchise IP.”</p>



<p>The press release concluded by reiterating that the game’s future updates will introduce new content, including mod support and new cities, with all updates and DLC provided for free until full release.</p>

<p>inZOI’s success hasn’t been without controversy, though. On launch, clips started going viral showing players being able to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/inzoi-lets-you-run-over-children/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">run over children within the game</a>, an issue that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/inzoi-developers-say-ability-to-run-over-children-was-a-bug/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Krafton quickly addressed and called a bug</a>.</p>



<p>inZOI currently sits at around 25,000 concurrent players in the past 24 hours, with 87,000 being the peak concurrent player count.</p>

		<p>Oh man, not only is the sun shining, but Nintendo are shining down on us too with the glorious reveal of all the Switch 2 details you could want (apart from pesky things like what chipset it’s rocking or the amount of RAM, but who needs to know that when there’s Mario Kart!). The battle is now on for pre-orders, and ShopTo have already told me I’m not in there first allocation. This has caused panic, but I’m sure that when the Nintendo store invites roll out I’ll be there. Surely, I’ll be there.</p>
<p>So this week, I asked the team what they were playing, and whether they were going to jump right into the Switch 2, hold off, or just play on the consoles they already have!</p>
<p><strong>Aran</strong> has played Croc for review, saying, “I found it pretty average. I’m currently playing Blue Prince for review and I’ll have more on that next week. Regarding the Switch 2, I won’t be getting one. I have a Switch that was barely used and I just don’t have the time I used to have to be able to keep up with games on multiple consoles anymore. I’m still playing Witcher 3 and I started that back in November!”</p>

<p><strong>Nic B</strong> has returned from Japan, and has dipped his toe into Monster Hunter Wilds in anticipation of Mizutsune (coming soon) and MTG Arena in anticipation of Tarkir (also coming soon). He says, “It’s gonna be a good month for games I like, but boy do I miss Japan already! As for the Switch 2, I’ll get one as soon as I can, but I doubt I’ll be in the preorder list as I haven’t had Switch Online for two years straight (I let it lapse when I have nothing to play online)!”</p>

<p><strong>Gamoc</strong> has played Balatro, Phasmo, Assassin’s Creed Shadows and Hitman regrettably not in VR. When asked about the Switch 2, he simply said, “Price increases on games sucks.”</p>
<p><strong>Jim</strong> is still very much in his ‘play one game at a time’ mode so he’s been putting a few more hours into Assassin’s Creed Shadows. He told us, “I wasn’t really vibing with the gameplay and open-ended story progression but something seems to have clicked – getting to this point has taken longer than what I would have liked but there’s a lot of fun to be had stalking the cities and castles of feudal Japan as Naoe, then bull-rushing everything as Yasuke.”</p>

<p><strong>Ade</strong> has been thoroughly enjoying Atomfall, saying, “It’s just a brilliant setting and great characters make it a joy to explore. Combat is perfunctory but the amount of dialogue options and accompanying meaningful choices that have genuine impact on the world more than make up for that. I’ve also just started on Commandos Origins for review. I’m not gonna pre-order a Switch 2, mostly because I’m poor. Though I’m sure I’ll eventually pick one up when Nintendo’s brilliant first-party stuff starts coming through.”</p>
<p><strong>Tuffcub</strong> has been playing the required Destiny 2, but also Black Myth Wukong which he says, “Is how games should be, nice short intro with stabby bits and not too long to get in to the game, and Indika in which I go against type and play as a nun. It’s very atmospheric.”</p>
<p><strong>Steve</strong> has also been enjoying Atomfall, whilst persevering with the ridiculous amount of collectables in Lego Skywalker and getting stuck into Metroid Dread. He says, “I’ve got a load of Switch games I’ve yet to play so no plans to pick up a Switch 2 any time soon – especially as many of the things it has to offer can already be done by my Steam Deck.”</p>
<p><strong>Tef</strong> meanwhile, has been out in Paris playing on the Switch 2 in real life! He has lots of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/04/nintendo-switch-2s-joy-con-mouse-mode-is-a-literal-game-changer/">thoughts</a> and words about it, all of which you can find on TSA over the next few days.</p>
<p>How about you? What have you played? And were you impressed enough by the Switch 2 Direct?</p>

But knowing the “why” of it doesn’t really ease the pain on the wallet. What’s more, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mario-kart-world-isnt-the-only-nintendo-switch-2-game-that-costs-80-some-nintendo-switch-2-edition-games-do-as-well"><u>we learned just this morning</u></a> that a number of Nintendo Switch 2 Edition games, including The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom and Kirby and the Forgotten Land, will also be $80. And with the AAA game <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/why-70-ps5-and-xbox-series-x-games-make-sensebut-the-timing-couldnt-be-worse"><u>price increase from $60 to $70 still firmly within recent memory</u></a>, fans are now worried that more and more games, Nintendo or otherwise, are going to start getting more and more and <em>more</em> expensive.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So what does the future hold? Are $80 games the new Nintendo normal?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As usual, rather than speculate ourselves, we went and found some expert analysts to tell us what they think is going to happen.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h3 data-cy="title3">A New Nintendo Normal</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">NYU Stern professor and author of <a href="https://superjoost.substack.com/p/the-joy-of-six" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>SuperJoost Playlist,</u></a> Joost van Dreunen, believes Nintendo is using Mario Kart World as a “test case for premium pricing,” and will evaluate consumer response before applying this more broadly. Spoilers: <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendos-switch-2-treehouse-livestream-is-just-a-flood-of-angry-comments-shouting-drop-the-price"><u>the response hasn’t been great so far</u></a>! But sentiment is not the same as sales, and Nintendo will likely measure success by how well Mario Kart World actually sells.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>“</strong>If the $80 price point succeeds, Nintendo will likely extend it selectively to their most valuable franchises rather than making it standard across their first-party lineup. Franchises that could potentially justify the premium pricing include:</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>The Legend of Zelda - the next mainline entry following Tears of the Kingdom could command $80 given the series' prestige and the expansive scope these games typically offer.</li><li>New 3D Mario adventures - for major releases in the vein of Super Mario Odyssey, Nintendo could position these as premium products.</li><li>Super Smash Bros. - the next installment of this franchise would be a strong candidate for premium pricing due to its extensive roster and competitive staying power.</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">“Games that likely wouldn't justify the premium price include smaller-scale entries, remasters, and series with more niche appeal. Nintendo will probably maintain a tiered pricing strategy, with their tent-pole franchises at $80, mid-tier releases at $60-70, and smaller titles at traditional price points.”</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Nintendo Switch 2 Game Boxes</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Rhys Elliott, games analyst at Alinea Analytics, had a similar take, pointing to the <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/en/finance/software/index.html" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>top 10 best-selling Nintendo Switch games</u></a> as a guide for what we might see get an $80 price tag in the future. “I could see Nintendo pricing mainline Pokémon games, mainline Zelda games, and the inevitably imminent 3D Mario and Animal Crossing games at $80 physical (but $70 digital still).”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And James McWhirter, analyst at Omdia, added a suggested hypothetical Splatoon 4 to the list of possibilities, along with another thought on future monetization:</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“For titles that do not adopt the $80 base price, Nintendo could lean in more heavily in alternative forms of monetisation, including those it has so far refrained from using, such as tying paid early access to higher value editions of its games.”</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Grand Theft, Grand Price?</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">That covers Nintendo, but what about other games? Earlier this year, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gta-6-at-100-would-be-a-bridge-too-far-even-for-grand-theft-auto"><u>we covered a flurry of speculation on one specifically: Grand Theft Auto 6</u></a>. At the time, we were responding to rumors and discussion that Take-Two might price the sequel to the over 200 million selling blockbuster at $80, $90, or even $100. Analysts suggested that the high end of this was rather unlikely, but what about now? Will Grand Theft Auto 6 cost $80... or even more?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Tiago Reis, market analyst at Newzoo, certainly thinks so. “For sure. Big hits that are highly anticipated (e.g., GTA 6, new CODs) can get away with it due to franchise recognition. Most people are not going to stop buying these games because they are $10 more expensive. If consumers are willing to wait, they can get it at a discount a couple of months after release. But by then, these companies have already extracted max value/price from the people who are less price sensitive.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Reis’ colleague Lauren Universe, client services manager at Newzoo, added: “Frankly, I expect base GTA to be at least $80, with multiple options of various increased prices (like Civ 7) that include expansions, DLCs, and ‘early access.’”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Dr. Serkan Toto, CEO of Kantan Games, agreed, and even expanded on who might be interested in raising prices beyond just Take-Two. “I do believe there is a chance that companies like Microsoft or Sony could feel encouraged to raise their prices now. Would you be shocked if Take-Two now thought to themselves: ‘If Nintendo can charge $80 for a Mario Kart game, we can do the same for GTA 6 - a title thousands of people have been working on for 12 years?”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Nuno Domingues Marques, also a market analyst at Newzoo, similarly brought up Sony and Microsoft as possible candidates for price hikes. “I am unsure if Sony/Xbox will wait for their next generation to make the push or if they will adjust post-Switch launch, but certainly, it seems like the way forward. Third-party publishers will jump on it as soon as they feel it is justified, which is likely ASAP. Not all exclusive games will cost $80, in my opinion though. Games like Ratchet &amp; Clank or other smaller niche experiences are likely to keep lower price points.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But Elliott pushed back a bit on the idea that Mario Kart World could have opened a higher pricing floodgate. He pointed out that at least in the UK and Europe (U.S. price discrepancies are still unconfirmed), Nintendo is charging more for the physical edition of Mario Kart World than digital in an effort to push more consumers toward the digital edition. But he suspects that because the other two console platforms are far more digitally-oriented than Nintendo (something he discussed in more detail in our other piece on the Switch 2 pricing), this would be a tougher sell for other publishers.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>While I believe Take Two could charge over $70 for GTA 6, I maintain that it is a bad idea.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">“While I believe Take Two could charge over $70 for GTA 6, I maintain that it is a bad idea for three reasons. [One,] the real cash cow is GTA Online and its recurring revenues, so limiting the total addressable audience at launch wouldn't be smart. There’s also a cost-of-living crisis happening globally and GTA appeals to everyone – rich and less fortunate.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"[Two,] Rockstar needs to move players from GTA 5, and a higher floor for the switching cost would limit the GTA 5-to-GTA 6 player acquisition. Players not budging from GTA 5 is probably one of GTA 6's biggest threats, one GTA hasn't really faced before. After all, live services are mostly zero-sum in today's oversaturated attention economy. GTA 6 isn't just competing against competitors' games, it's competing with TikTok, Netflix, and even its predecessor.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"[Three,] Rockstar can easily charge $100 or more for an edition of GTA 6 with a week of early access, maybe with a shark card thrown in. Players with disposable income will pay for it. This is the best of both worlds for Take-Two. This is pretty much the norm for AAA games these days.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Elliott concluded that even with all that in mind, GTA 6 nonetheless stands a better chance than any other game at withstanding a price hike with its consumer base intact. So ultimately, the question of GTA 6’s pricing remains an impossible one to answer up to the point where Take-Two finally announces it.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Living in Interesting Times</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">I’ll end on a hopeful note, though, which I got from both Mat Piscatella, analyst at Circana, and a couple of analysts at Newzoo. These folks told me that while we’re likely to keep seeing games get more expensive (and, as Piscatella points out, have already been for a while via Collector’s Editions and similar), we may also see them get cheaper in certain ways. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Other Nintendo games will certainly follow suit,” said Brett Hunt, market analyst at Newzoo. “It could, however, open the door for Nintendo to have an adjusted discounting strategy for the Switch 2.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Marques agreed. “Maybe we will see a bigger window of pricing as well, as seen from the Donkey Kong game. Creation of space for multiple different-sized games; games that cost $49.99, $59.99, etc., having distinct content depth and breadth expectations. I agree that maybe a new discounting strategy is coming from Nintendo.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And as Piscatella put it, Nintendo may not be the only company that sees the need to break with $70 convention in more than just one way. “We certainly could see other publishers try and establish even higher base prices for some of their new games. But we could also see more significant price promotion and discounting as well.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"With all of the uncertainty in the market, we're at a point where both publishers and consumers will have to figure out where things go next. These are, after all, interesting times."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN. You can find her posting on BlueSky @duckvalentine.bsky.social.

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/inzoi">InZoi</a> - the early access life-sim game from Krafton - debuted at the end of March, and has since passed a record breaking sales milestone for the company.</p>
<p>In its first week of release, InZoi crossed the 1m sales mark. This lofty figure marks the fastest sales milestone ever achieved by a Krafton published title.</p>

<p>"We are grateful and excited to present InZoi to players around the world through Early Access," said CEO CH Kim, adding: "We will continue to actively communicate with players and foster InZoi as Krafton’s long-term franchise IP."</p>
<p>Meanwhile, <a href="https://x.com/PlayinZOI/status/1908082411906449478/photo/1">writing on social media</a>, the team said this is a "number that still feels unreal to us and a milestone we could not have reached without each and every one of you".</p>
<p>
"Your excitement, your creations, your feedback, your content, and your support have brought InZoi to life in ways we never could have imagined."</p>

<p>Despite this impressive start, InZoi's launch hasn't been without its issues. Last week, Krafton had to patch out a bug in its early access release, which <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/inzoi-developer-resolves-to-strengthen-internal-review-processes-following-bug-which-allowed-players-to-run-over-and-kill-children">allowed players to run over children in InZoi with a car and kill them</a>.</p>
<p>"This issue was caused by an unintended bug that has been resolved in the latest patch. These depictions are highly inappropriate and do not reflect the intent and values of InZoi," a Krafton spokesperson told Eurogamer. </p>
<p>
"We understand the seriousness of this matter and age-appropriate content and we are strengthening our internal review processes to prevent similar incidents in the future."</p>

<p>Team Cherry has had the world waiting with bated breath for a long time. It seemed like Hollow Knight Silksong didn’t exist at one point, but new developments mean we have a release period—and we might finally get to hear Silksong’s voice.</p>



<p>Hollow Knight Silksong has become somewhat of a myth in recent times. The Metroidvania sequel might be the most sought-after sequel after GTA 6. If you think I’m being hyperbolic, you only need to look at Steam’s wishlist page at any point in the last few months (maybe years) to see it’s been a constant number one.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-nintendo-direct-everything-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nintendo Switch 2 Direct event</a> was massive for Nintendo fans, but inadvertently got the Silksong hopefuls up in arms.</p>



<h2 id="h-hollow-knight-silksong-release-period">Hollow Knight Silksong Release Period</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Anything more specific? Credit to Team Cherry</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>We know Hollow Knight Silksong is set to release at some point in 2025, but there’s no official release date yet.</strong></p>



<p>Honestly, we’ll take it at this point. Six years after the game’s official announcement, a Silksong release date continues to elude us. But at least the Nintendo Switch 2 Direct confirmed it’s arriving this year.</p>



<p>The presentation had a “Partner Sizzle Reel” showing off <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-games-announced-during-the-nintendo-switch-2-direct/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">several games coming to Switch 2</a>. Hollow Knight Silksong was thrown in early on with a few seconds of gameplay. But crucially, it showed off the “2025” release period. The sequel is finally starting to look like it’s arriving in 2025.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Insider Gaming will duly (and excitedly) update you once <a href="https://hollowknightsilksong.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Hollow Knight Silksong</a> has an official release date.</p>



<h2 id="h-why-is-hollow-knight-silksong-taking-so-long">Why is Hollow Knight Silksong Taking so Long?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>The world is ready. Credit to Team Cherry</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Team Cherry hasn’t given an official reason as to why Hollow Knight Silksong is taking so long, but it’s more than likely due to the studio wanting to improve and perfect the experience to ensure it’s complete for release.</strong></p>



<p>Firstly, Silksong was supposed to release in 2023. A <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/silksong-delayed-2023/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">delay was announced</a> with the developer explaining on <a href="https://x.com/griffinmatta/status/1656106351184199680?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1656106351184199680%7Ctwgr%5E0123a947c87bc1d12a132d80aea81715e67f8dc6%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Finsider-gaming.com%2Fsilksong-delayed-2023%2F" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a>: “We had planned to release in the 1st half of 2023, but development is still continuing. We’re excited by how the game is shaping up, and it’s gotten quite big, so we want to take the time to make the game as good as we can.”</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hollow-knight-silksong-rating-suggests-release-coming-soon/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Silksong was officially rated in April 2024</a>, leading everyone to believe a release was imminent. Unfortunately, 2024 came and went with no sign of the game. In January 2025, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/team-cherry-gives-small-update-on-hollow-knight-silksong/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Team Cherry explained</a>: “Yes, the game is real, progressing, and will release.” This addressed concerns that Silksong’s development was troubled or canceled.</p>



<p>Fast forward to April 2025, and we finally have a Silksong release period. After six years, it feels the waiting is nearly done!</p>
