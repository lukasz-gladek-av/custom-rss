            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/cult-of-lamb-composer-narayana-johnson-dies<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Cult of the Lamb&nbsp;</em>composer Narayana Johnson, who worked under the pseudonym River Boy, has passed away, leading developer Massive Monster to call for fans to give them "some space and some kindness".</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1313140/view/524213474678538839" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on the game's Steam page, Massive Monster says it's "impossible to describe how much of a void" Johnson's passing will leave at the studio. He was Massive Monster's audio director, but the dev says he was "more than" that; he was also a "creative powerhouse", a "friend", and "[their] silly little guy".</p>

<p>Massive Monster goes on to say that Johnson is "woven into the soul of&nbsp;<em>Cult of the Lamb</em>" thanks to his audio work on the game, and that both the game and the studio "won't be the same" without him.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/cult-of-the-lamb-composer-narayana-johnson-dies-game-shot.jpg?itok=DS4JjmvW 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/cult-of-the-lamb-composer-narayana-johnson-dies-game-shot.jpg?itok=Eve1pUu8 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Cult of the Lamb&nbsp;</em>composer Narayana Johnson has sadly passed away.</figcaption></figure><p>No cause of death was given for Johnson, and no illness was previously revealed either, so it's not entirely clear how he passed away at present.</p>

<p>Massive Monster says it recommends that you "take a moment to look at nature" and "touch your feet to the earth" to celebrate Johnson's life, and that "he would want you to listen to his music and remember how much it meant to him to share it".</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with Johnson as a composer, he often worked under the pseudonym River Boy, and he was also half of the duo Willow Beats.</p>

<p>According to his website, Narayana Johnson made music that "draws extensively on his childhood and teenage years spent roaming creeks, forests and mountains in the Northern Rivers, New South Wales".</p>




<p>His work on&nbsp;<em>Cult of the Lamb&nbsp;</em>feels very evocative of the game's tone; it's dark, eerie electronica, but there's a playful element to it as well, reflective of the game's mixture of sacrificial rituals and cutesy animals.</p>

This is a seriously <em>Vergecast</em>-y week, actually, in the sense that two of the year’s biggest news stories — <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/634603/nintendo-switch-2-price-release-date-details">the Nintendo Switch 2</a> and the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/642240/trump-tariffs-imports-apple-manufacturing">Trump administration’s disastrous economic policy</a> — are both unfolding simultaneously, and stand to affect one another in <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/642459/switch-2-price-donald-trump-tariffs-china-vietnam-cambodia">unusually direct ways</a>.

Nintendo’s Direct announcement this week <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/630264/nintendo-switch-2-specs-details-performance">brought a lot of new information</a> about the company’s new console, and a peek at some of its most anticipated games.

Butler explains why Alibaba is such an important platform for hardware companies, how even small price changes can have large knock-on effects, and whether his delightful music gadget will have to change to fit the new system.</p><div><p>Finally, in the lightning round, it’s time for another round of “Brendan Carr is a Dummy.” Because somehow, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/641068/t-mobile-closes-lumos-deal-after-dropping-dei">there’s always material</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/what-is-warzone-casual-in-call-of-duty-battle-royale-mode-explained/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Casual Mode is another headline-making addition to Call of Duty in Season 3. Warzone players can benefit from this helpful new battle royale variation designed to help you and improve your Warzone skills.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/cod-season-03-patch-notes-warzone-black-ops-6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Ops 6 and Warzone 3</a> is a surreal content launch aiming to bring back players who loved the game years ago when <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-unlock-verdansk-is-back-calling-card/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Verdansk</a> was first around. Season 3 is also trying to rekindle weary Black Ops 6 players’ love for CoD. On top of this are brand-new players who never had the chance to play Verdansk when it was around.</p>



<p>Activision infamously took the game out of circulation once Warzone Caldera launched. The decision has been reversed in 2025 with Warzone Season 3, and Verdansk isn’t the only thing that’s landed—say hello to Casual Mode.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-warzone-casual-mode">What is Warzone Casual Mode?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Not everyone is prepared for the pressure. Credit to Activision</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Warzone’s Casual Mode is a semi-tutorial mode featuring Bots and real players designed to bridge the gap between the battle royale’s Bot-only Bootcamp game mode and the PvE nature of real-time battle royale.</strong></p>



<p>The are four Warzone levels for players to choose: <strong>Bootcamp, Casual, Normal, and Ranked</strong>.</p>



<p>Bootcamp was first introduced for Urzikstan and features 20 real-life players in teams of four (yourself and three friends or randomly assigned teammates) against 24 Bots—also in teams of four. You drop into a small circle on the map and get to experience a bite-sized game of battle royale.</p>



<p>After this, players need to step up to a real lobby full of human players. This can be overwhelming, which is why <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/verdansk-launching-battle-royale-casual-mode/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Casual Mode</a> has been introduced.</p>



<h2 id="h-casual-mode-differences-compared-to-normal-warzone">Casual Mode Differences Compared to Normal Warzone</h2>



<p><strong>You get to experience a full-length game of Warzone featuring the entire map of Verdansk in Casual Mode, and the lobby consists of 28 Players and 120 Bots.</strong></p>



<p>This is a far greater number of opponents; you use the entire map, but the game is still largely Bots for the hand-holding experience. Many players might feel intimidated going into a proper game with human operators, so this is the perfect middle ground.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/patchnotes/2025/03/call-of-duty-bo6-warzone-season-03-patch-notes" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">CoD Blog</a> introducing Casual Mode said: “This is designed as a stepping stone for players to go from the Warzone Bootcamp tutorial mode to an experience closer to our traditional, player-only, experience. Players can learn the game and hone their skills in a lower-stress environment while still embracing the core survival challenge of being the last squad standing among 148 players.”</p>



<h2 id="h-is-warzone-casual-worth-playing">Is Warzone Casual Worth Playing?</h2>



<p><strong>Warzone Casual offers a slightly more stress-free way to play and enjoy CoD’s battle royale, but it still features players who can destroy you very easily.</strong></p>



<p>With a ratio of 28 players to 120 Bots, chances are the majority of your combat is against AI until you reach the final few circles. This gives you a chance to grind Camos, earn XP, and soak in the atmosphere of Verdansk.</p>



<p><strong>But be warned</strong>: The community has complained that <em>Ranked Warzone players with high skill levels</em> are hopping into Warzone Casual. This might be because they’re grinding Camos or putting together gameplay compilations. </p>



<p>I stress that even though Warzone Casual hits the nail on the head, don’t be surprised to see a sliding demon come out of nowhere and melt you before you even get a chance to aim your weapon!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gematsu.com/2025/04/the-duskbloods-creators-voice-interview-with-director-hidetaka-miyazaki<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>Get the full interview below.</p><div><p><strong>■ Part 1: Blood by Dusk</strong></p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Duskbloods-Creators-Voice_04-04-25_001.jpg"></a></figure><p><strong>Can you please give us a quick self-introduction?</strong></p><p>My name is Hidetaka Miyazaki. I work at FromSoftware (1), and I am the director for <em>The Duskbloods</em>.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p><em>(1) FromSoftware, Inc.: A game development and publishing company. They have developed games such as <a title="Games > Elden Ring [31 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/elden-ring">Elden Ring</a> and have released Dark Souls: Remastered on Nintendo Switch.</em></p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Duskbloods-Creators-Voice_04-04-25_002.jpg"></a></figure><p><strong>First off, please tell us what led to this title being developed for Nintendo Switch 2.</strong></p><p>A while back, we had the opportunity to meet with Nintendo to discuss ideas, and during this discussion, we presented a rough outline for <em>The Duskbloods</em>.</p><p>It was still very bare-bones at the time—more a loose string of ideas than a proper presentation. The concept itself was different from anything we had done before, and Nintendo seemed very interested in helping make it a reality. So that’s when the project kicked off.</p><p>At first it was being worked on by a small team as a title for Nintendo Switch. However just as the game started to take shape, we were approached by Nintendo with talk of Switch 2, which led us to revamp our development path with this new hardware in mind.</p><p>The new hardware’s focus on online features allowed us to stay as true to the original vision as possible, which was very good news for us.</p><p><strong>It sounds like the game differs from most of your previous titles. Can you give us a little more detail as to what type of game it is?</strong></p><p>In terms of structure, we consider it a PvPvE (2) title. At its core, it’s an online multiplayer* focused game, with both player vs player and player vs enemy gameplay.</p><p><em>(2) An acronym referring to a style of fighting where, in addition to players fighting each other, players also fight enemies (CPUs) that appear in the game.</em></p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Duskbloods-Creators-Voice_04-04-25_003.jpg"></a></figure><p><strong>Did you always have some desire to make a PvPvE type game?</strong></p><p>Yes, I’ve always found the PvPvE structure very interesting. It allows for a broad range of game-design ideas, while also letting us leverage our experience of designing challenging enemy encounters.</p><p>As a side note, please allow me to address one thing. As previously mentioned, this is an online multiplayer title at its core, but this doesn’t mean that we as a company have decided to shift to a more multiplayer-focused direction with titles going forward.</p><p>The Nintendo Switch 2 version of <em>Elden Ring</em> (3) was also announced, and we still intend to actively develop single player-focused games such as this that embrace our more traditional style.</p><p><em>(3) Nintendo Switch 2 software planned for release in 2025. Elden Ring is a fantasy <a title="Genres > Action RPG [1,558 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/rpg/action-rpg">action RPG</a> set in a massive open world, where you develop your character according to your playstyle.</em></p><p><strong>Please tell us about the game’s characters and setting.</strong></p><p>The game’s protagonists, or characters controlled by the player, are known as “Bloodsworn.” The Bloodsworn are a group whose members have achieved super-human abilities through the power of special blood. As a general concept, they’re similar to vampires, but they are not portrayed as the horrifying monsters you might associate with traditional vampirism.</p><p>We tried to extract the sort of romantic aspects we found interesting from concepts such as vampires and “blood” and reinterpreted them as the Bloodsworn.</p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Duskbloods-Creators-Voice_04-04-25_004.jpg"></a></figure><p>In <em>The Duskbloods</em>, the Bloodsworn are competing for something known as “First Blood.” As human society reaches an end, First Blood flows in an event known as the “Twilight of Humanity.” The Bloodsworn are summoned to the Twilight of Humanity across a variety of different times and places in a bid to obtain First Blood.</p><p>Due to this, there is no fixed era or location in which <em>The Duskbloods</em> takes place. There are more traditional Gothic- or Victorian-style maps as well as those depicting the closing years of the early modern period, like the one glimpsed in the trailer with the train running through it.</p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Duskbloods-Creators-Voice_04-04-25_005.jpg"></a></figure><p><strong>Can you let us know the meaning behind the title <em><em>The Duskbloods</em></em>?</strong></p><p><em>The Duskbloods</em> directly refers to the Bloodsworn themselves. As mentioned earlier, the Bloodsworn are summoned to the Twilight of humanity in a battle for First Blood. “Duskbloods” is a collective term for these characters controlled by the player.</p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Duskbloods-Creators-Voice_04-04-25_006.jpg"></a></figure><p><strong>It sounds like blood plays a pretty big role in the game.</strong></p><p>Yes. In the context of this game, blood is used more conceptually, as opposed to literal meanings like physical depictions of injury.</p><p>Blood symbolizes one of the game’s key themes—the history it holds, the power it passes on, the fates it weaves and the marker of those who have surpassed the limitations of their own humanity.</p><p><strong>■ Part 2: Superhuman Abilities and Opportunistic Behavior</strong></p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Duskbloods-Creators-Voice_04-04-25_007.jpg"></a></figure><p><strong>What are some characteristics of the Bloodsworn?</strong></p><p>There are several reasons we put the players’ focus on the Bloodsworn, with one of those being character actions.</p><p>The Bloodsworn possess superhuman abilities thanks to special blood, so their actions are more dramatic than anything seen in our previous titles.</p><p>Even basic character actions in this game such as sprinting, super jump, and double jump are designed to be dynamic and stress free and are complemented by each character’s own unique weapons and abilities, allowing for a wide range of creativity.</p><p>Also, and while this isn’t directly related to the Bloodsworn themselves, the setting allows for the depiction of firearms and such, and every character is equipped with some means of attacking from a distance. I feel this is one of the game’s unique aspects when compared with our previous titles. I hope these new action elements are one area that players will enjoy.</p><p><strong>Earlier you referred to “protagonists” or “characters” as plural. Does this mean the player will be able to choose from multiple different characters?</strong></p><p>Yes, there are over a dozen characters for the player to choose from, each with their own identity and appearance. I think there are a lot of unique elements to the character designs and the weapons they use, so hopefully players can find one or two favorites among them.</p><p>Also, each character can be customized to a certain extent, allowing players the fun of building a character that feels like their own.</p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Duskbloods-Creators-Voice_04-04-25_008.jpg"></a></figure><p><strong>Can you provide some more detail on the general gameplay loop?</strong></p><p>The game has a so-called “hub” area, where players can choose their character, customize them and enter online multiplayer*. Online multiplayer supports up to 8 players. Upon concluding an online match, players then return to the hub, at which point they receive some sort of reward whether they win or lose. Using these rewards, players can further customize their character, and so the cycle continues.</p><p>Online matches are generally last player standing, however there are certain cases where victory conditions differ. For example, players may be tasked with teaming up to take down a powerful boss enemy, or find themselves in other special circumstances.</p><p><strong>So, victory conditions are influenced not just by PvP (4) results, but PvE (5) results as well?</strong></p><p>That’s right. Some victory conditions center around defeating a boss enemy.</p><p><em>(4) An acronym for the style of game where players fight other players.</em></p><p><em>(5) An acronym for the style of game where players fight enemies (CPUs).</em></p><p><strong>I can’t think of many examples with that ruleset. It sounds very interesting.</strong></p><p>I’m happy to hear you say that.</p><p>Regardless of whether it’s PvP or PvE, the idea is to provide players with an experience that allows them to learn and hone their skills as they play. We’ve therefore designed the PvE boss encounters to present a tough challenge and a sense of accomplishment upon defeating them.</p><p><strong>So players can also enjoy improving their own skills over time as they battle?</strong></p><p>Yes. Although there are a variety of elements in place that keep the game from becoming too stoic. For example, how players conduct themselves during the match is just as important as direct combat.</p><p><em>The Duskbloods</em> implements “Victory Points,” which are responsible for ultimately deciding the outcome of a match. To obtain Victory Points, direct combat is of course important, but it’s not the only way. Some players may prefer to earn points by avoiding direct combat and instead engaging in more opportunistic behavior. How you earn points is entirely up to you.</p><p>Additionally, each character can summon an entity to assist in combat, giving players a high degree of freedom when it comes to how they fight—and win.</p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Duskbloods-Creators-Voice_04-04-25_009.jpg"></a></figure><p>Another important aspect is match variables, such as the event system. This system has the potential to alter the course of the match, such as special enemy spawns and additional objectives with accompanying bonus rewards.</p><p>In the trailer, you may have noticed a giant stone face looming in the sky. This is one example of the events that can occur in a match. In this case, the appearance of this stone face affects the environment and changes match rewards, which can have an immediate impact on player motivations and objectives.</p><p>These events don’t happen all the time, and I hope discovering them gives players some incentive to keep coming back.</p><p><strong>It sounds like even those who tend to shy away from PvP can still enjoy themselves.</strong></p><p>That was the intention. I personally am not much of a PvP person, and I wanted to make something that’s satisfying even for players like me.</p><p>While the goal of a match is to obtain First Blood, there are personal objectives that provide separate rewards to the player as well, so I hope these add to the fun of each engagement.</p><p><strong>■ Part 3: Playing Roles and Altering <a title="Series > Fate [66 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/series/fate">Fate</a>s</strong></p><p><strong>What other ways might players enjoy the game outside of combat?</strong></p><p>One thing I love doing in any game I direct is leaving fragments of lore and worldbuilding details, allowing the player the fun of using their imagination to make connections. <em>The Duskbloods</em> is no exception to this.</p><p>However, we’ve gone about it a little differently from previous titles. The fragments this time are found in the previously mentioned character customization items: their “blood history and fate.” Customizing a character will reveal a piece of information regarding the world and its unfolding story.</p><p><strong>You customize their “blood history and fate”?</strong></p><p>Yes. Analyzing and altering a character’s blood history and fate allows players to customize all sorts of things, from their abilities, appearance, and inner characteristics to the role they play in the world and relationships with other characters.</p><p>Focusing these elements on the concept of “blood” or “blood history and fate” allowed for a deeper exploration of customization and is another reason we placed the Bloodsworn as the protagonists.</p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Duskbloods-Creators-Voice_04-04-25_010.jpg"></a></figure><p><strong>Do you mind sharing any other points you personally find interesting?</strong></p><p>One area I haven’t talked about yet is “roles.”</p><p>In online play*, roles give players special responsibilities and objectives that often lead to unique interactions and relationships between players based on their corresponding roles.</p><p>That’s probably not much info to go on, so allow me to provide a few examples. But please note we’re still finalizing some of the naming and details.</p><p>For example, if a player possesses the “Destined Rivals” role, another player is designated as their rival, and they are tasked with finding and defeating that player. Doing so counts as achieving a personal goal, separate from the overall victory conditions.</p><p>Another example is “Destined Companion,” where one player is required to seek out another designated as their companion, which results in a special reward if they form a bond with one another.</p><p>Roles can be assigned to any character via blood customization, allowing players to enjoy role-playing in a literal sense and hopefully adding to the drama of these engagements.</p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Duskbloods-Creators-Voice_04-04-25_011.jpg"></a></figure><p><strong>Kind of like how players can pick their roles in a table-top RPG (6)?</strong></p><p>Exactly. While not entirely intentional, it may reflect my own interests a bit. It might seem a little unorthodox at first, but I hope players will give it a try.</p><p><em>(6) <a title="Genres > RPG [17,123 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/rpg">Role-playing games</a> played with things like dice and player, with players interacting with each other while following rules described in a rulebook.</em></p><p><strong>That reminds me, I was curious about the winged rat character seen in the trailer. Can you provide some details as to what role this character serves?</strong></p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Duskbloods-Creators-Voice_04-04-25_012.jpg"></a></figure><p>That character shares a similar role with the fire keepers from the <em>Dark Souls</em> series. They remain in the hub area, providing the player with advice and guidance.</p><p>I suppose you could say we tried doing something a little Nintendo-esque in the spirit of the partnership.</p><p><strong>What do you mean by that?</strong></p><p>We tried something cute for a change. Although I will say this character is actually an elderly gentleman (laughter).</p><p>(Laughter) Is there anything else you’d like to say before we finish?</p><p>In addition to creating a PvPvE title, we’ve tried our hand at introducing a lot of new and interesting ideas with <em>The Duskbloods</em>.</p><p>From superhuman player actions, a free-form combat approach, and gameplay that’s dynamic and dramatic to the romanticized aesthetic of the Bloodsworn, deep character customization and fragmentary storytelling, I think there’s a lot to appreciate and enjoy in this title and I sincerely hope players look forward to it.</p><p><strong>Thank you very much for your time.</strong></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>One of the big draws of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-release-date-specs-display-price/1100-6520278/">Switch 2</a> is that the console will be backwards compatible with the Switch games library, barring a few exceptions. Nintendo has also explained that not every game will operate smoothly at launch on the Switch 2, as the hybrid console doesn't natively run Switch games. Instead, Nintendo uses a workaround method involving hardware and software to get Switch games working on the Switch 2.</p><p>"When we first started Switch 2 development, the focus was on enhancing its performance as hardware, namely, expanding its capacity," <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/whatsnew/ask-the-developer-vol-16-nintendo-switch-2-part-4/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nintendo's Takuhiro Dohta explained</a>. "So, compatibility was a lower priority. For example, Nintendo DS games were playable on Nintendo 3DS, and Wii games were playable on Wii U, but it was difficult to achieve the same level of compatibility with Switch 2, because the hardware-design approach was different from those systems."</p><div tabindex="0" data-id="110807199" data-promo-id="0" data-user-has-ads="1"

running out of battery power more quickly. "We did something that’s somewhere in between a software emulator and hardware compatibility," Dohta explained. Nintendo will still work to ensure that games run as smoothly as possible ahead of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-preorder-guide-mario-kart-world-bundle/1100-6530531/">Switch 2's launch in June</a>, but developers have cautioned that not every game will be ready when the console arrives.</p><p>So far, games like Alan Wake Remastered, Fall Guys, and Street Fighter 30th Anniversary Collection have undefined compatibility issues, while other games like Rocket League and Wolfenstein 2: The New Colossus have what Nintendo calls startup issues. You can check out our list of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/is-the-nintendo-switch-2-backwards-compatible/1100-6527615/">games with Switch 2 compatibility issues</a> for more information.</p><p>This week has been an informative one for potential Switch 2 owners, as not only did we get an official release date--June 5--for the console, but also more details on its price and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/all-the-nintendo-switch-2-games/2900-6128/">launch games</a>. Nintendo has also shown off some other interesting facts about the Switch 2, like its <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-outlines-switch-2-accessibility-features/1100-6530598/">accessibility features</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-could-fix-two-of-the-biggest-issues-on-the-nintendo-eshop/1100-6530585/">changes to the eShop</a>, and a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2s-main-menu-isnt-that-different-from-the-one-on-nintendo-switch/1100-6530604/">closer look at its user interface</a>.</p>

                <p>Rockstar's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/grand-theft-auto-6-everything-we-know/1100-6503729/" data-ref-id="1100-6503729">Grand Theft Auto VI</a> is poised to be 2025's biggest new game release, and so far we've heard sales projections of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-5-could-make-3-billion-in-first-year-alone/1100-6528605/" data-ref-id="1100-6528605">40 million copies in the first year and $3 billion in revenue</a>. Only one piece of work in history may end up outperforming it, according to Hollywood veteran Craig Mazin--the Bible.</p><p><a href="https://variety.com/2025/gaming/global/last-of-us-fallout-creators-tv-adaptations-bafta-games-awards-1236352651/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Speaking to Variety</a>, Mazin said he expects GTA 6 to become the "largest-selling piece of media ever," with the exception of the Bible. As such, he expects Hollywood to "very carefully" watch how the game performs.</p><p>It's unknown how many copies of the Bible have been produced, but estimates suggest it could be <a href="https://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/best-selling-book-of-non-fiction#:~:text=AdvertisementsOne%20key%20milestone%20in,around%2080%20million%20per%20year." data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">as many as 7 billion.</a> Obviously, GTA 6 is not going to sell 7 billion copies. But the point Mazin is making is that he expects Rockstar to once again deliver a product in GTA 6 that smashes records and raises the bar.</p><p>"People are getting used to an interesting combination of handmade, super-attentive method of making things married to size, which again, makes things harder to do," he said. "And as the bar is raised with production, and as every episode starts to approach movie quality and movie intensity, it does take more time."</p><p>Mazin has worked in Hollywood for a long time and was best known for the Scary Movie and The Hangover franchises before a dramatic turn with HBO's Chernobyl and more recently The Last of Us. </p><p>Given the size and scale of the GTA franchise, many may wonder why there hasn't been a feature film or TV adaptation. To begin with, Take-Two boss Strauss Zelnick says <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-company-explains-why-its-franchises-rarely-get-made-into-movies-or-tv-shows/1100-6516697/" data-ref-id="1100-6516697">adaptations for film and TV simply do not make a lot of money</a>, and he would know, as Zelnick was previously an executive at Columbia Pictures and 20th Century Fox. Zelnick said singling out success stories like HBO's The Last of Us and Universal's The Super Mario Bros.

Given that, Take-Two has said it will be "very selective" when it comes to licensing its properties for film or TV.</p><p>Take-Two's Borderlands franchise received a feature film adaptation starring many famous Hollywood celebrities, but it tanked upon release in 2024, earning <a href="https://www.boxofficemojo.com/title/tt4978420/?ref_=bo_se_r_1" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">only $33 million worldwide.</a> In fact, Mazin was originally involved with the Borderlands movie before parting ways, replaced by a writer named "Joe Crombie." Some people believe <a href="https://www.avclub.com/borderlands-review" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">this person does not actually exist.</a></p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-movie-has-earned-a-shockingly-low-amount-after-first-month/1100-6526440/" data-ref-id="1100-6526440">Lionsgate financed the Borderlands movie</a>, so Take-Two and Gearbox are largely unaffected by the major miss, apart from reputational damage and the possibility of movie studios looking to steer clear of any future partnerships.</p><p>Another Take-Two franchise set for a Hollywood adaptation is BioShock, which is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-boys-star-jack-quaid-wants-to-be-in-bioshock-movie-currently-obsessed-with-fromsoft-games/1100-6530154/" data-ref-id="1100-6530154">getting a movie at Netflix--however, the project has been scaled down.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pacific-drive-endless-expeditions-update<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer Ironwood Studios and publisher Kepler Interactive have released a new&nbsp;<em>Pacific Drive&nbsp;</em>update, and this one's ideal if you thought the base game wasn't quite roguelite enough.</p>

<p>The Endless Expeditions update is the latest in a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pacific-drive-update-customization" rel="nofollow">string</a> of post-launch&nbsp;<em>Pacific Drive&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pacific-drive-sales-update" rel="nofollow">updates</a>, and its main feature is its namesake, the Expeditions mode, which Ironwood describes as offering "roguelite-style trips with unique routes and restrictions".</p>

<p>You'll start out from your garage "with an ever-changing set of challenges and restrictions", so if you feel like you've already seen everything&nbsp;<em>Pacific Drive&nbsp;</em>has to offer, this update may give you pause for thought on that front.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pacific-drive-endless-expeditions-update-map.jpg?itok=OqAkxLnn 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pacific-drive-endless-expeditions-update-map.jpg?itok=ZQGC8PdZ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Pacific Drive</em>'s Endless Expeditions update should give you a few new challenges if you're a roguelite fan.</figcaption></figure><p>This update also introduces the ability to suspend your game no matter where you are, so you can suspend an in-progress run if you've got something else more urgent to do.</p>

<p>Additionally, you can look forward to "over an hour" of new radio music spread across 21 songs, created by "new and returning artists", as well as upgrades to the Plasma Scrapper and Thermal Vacuum tools to make them more efficient.</p>

<p>The new Ida's Exchange vendor will let you purchase new unique parts and resources for your car, as well as cosmetics to make it look a little nicer, and the route planning UI has been refreshed "for better readability" too.</p>

<p>If you want to know more about the Expeditions mode, be sure to keep an eye on Ironwood's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@ironwoodstudios/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">YouTube channel</a>, where the developer will be releasing an in-depth look at the mode in the coming days.</p>




<p>If you're unfamiliar with&nbsp;<em>Pacific Drive</em>, it's a survival-based driving game in which you must uncover the mysteries of a&nbsp;<em>Stalker</em>-style exclusion zone racked with anomalies and other dangers.</p>

<p>The game is available right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1458140/Pacific_Drive/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a> and <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/pacific-drive/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, as is the Endless Expeditions update.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/assassins-creed-shadows-actress-masumi-on-naoe-the-challenges-of-acting-in-games.1155273/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/interviews/assassins-creed-shadows-actress-masumi-on-naoe-challenges-of-acting-in-games<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/assassins-creed-shadows-story-attempting-to-hit-word-limit" rel="nofollow"><em>Assassin's Creed Shadows</em></a> often feels like two games in one. If you play as Yasuke, you'll mow down enemies like an indestructible tank. If you play as Naoe, you'll dance in the shadows, elegantly carving a path toward your goal.&nbsp;</p>

<p>They're opposites in so many ways. Yasuke is a gentle giant with strong convictions, while Naoe's petite stature contains a wealth of rage and fury. Over time, she hones this storm of emotions into a sharp blade, focused squarely on restoring freedom to Japan.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The actress behind this performance? Masumi, a Japanese American who previously starred in Netflix's <em>Yakuza Princess</em>. We interviewed her about her first major role in a AAA video game, where we learned about all the skills she brought to <em>Assassin's Creed Shadows</em>.</p>



<h2>A Deep Dive Into Naoe's Traumas</h2>

<p>Players who have seen the moment where Naoe and Yasuke meet know about her initial character arc. She goes from grief to greatness, and in Masumi's words, Naoe finds her "true power in her own shadows."&nbsp;</p>

<p>"All of the knowledge, skills, and wisdom that are passed down to her becomes almost like a curse because she doesn't know how to control her shadows made of trauma, anger, and pain," she said. "This story is about Naoe overcoming her inner demons and harnessing the true power of the shadows."&nbsp;</p>

<p>Naoe and Yasuke initially meet in an awkward position, but as Masumi puts it, they go from "enemies to lifelong friends." At first, they rely on each other because of their different talents, but throughout the game, you see more tender moments between them. These moments are courtesy of the acting work of Masumi and Tongayi Chirisa, who plays Yasuke.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"Working with him was a treat! It didn't feel like work because we had so much fun working together," Masumi said about her fellow protagonist. "I respect him so much as an actor and a senpai as well, so I got to learn a lot from working with him."&nbsp;</p>

<p>Personally, I found that Yasuke brings out the best in Naoe, breaking down her trauma-built barriers with kindness. It adds emotional complexity to her character, which Masumi really related to.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"I love how she takes in the moments of beauty when she notices them and lets the moments of sadness sink in when they come," she said. "She can be cool and calm like a ninja, or rage fiercely like a warrior! All while being the petite size that she is."</p>



<h2>The Hard Parts of Acting in a Video Game</h2>

<p>Masumi's previous experience on <em>Yakuza Princess</em> prepared her well for <em>Assassin's Creed Shadows</em>. She had training in Japanese sword fighting with actor Masa Kanome in LA because of the movie, and it came in handy for her role as Naoe.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"We practice coming up with a fight choreography within 5 minutes at the end of every class. We have to quickly memorize all the choreography parts and tape it," she said. "So that skill definitely helped me book the job and also add some movements to Naoe in the game."&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>Assassin's Creed Shadows</em> presented Masumi with her first opportunities at motion capture and performance capture, both of which are common ways to record human movement and acting for games. In fact, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/features/obstacles-animal-motion-capture-video-game-development" rel="nofollow">these techniques can be used for animals</a>, too!&nbsp;</p>

<p>You've probably seen behind-the-scenes videos of people doing this in skin-tight body suits, often with markings for the cameras to track them. Needless to say, it's not the most immersive setting for an actor to perform in.</p>

<p>"You really have to tap into your imagination and trust your body to bring the character to life," Masumi said about the challenges of motion capture. "I also needed to ask questions about the weight or texture of the 'door' that I might be opening in a scene, to make it real for myself!"</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"As challenging as it was, it was also a rewarding experience. I learned so much." —Masumi, actress</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Nonetheless, motion capture still lets a person act with their entire body. With voiceovers though, all the perceived "output" comes through only in voice.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"You have to convey everything through tone, breath, and energy. And because it’s a game, you’re not always recording in sequence, which means finding the right emotional beats without the full context," she said. "I have such renewed respect for VO actors after being on this project!"&nbsp;</p>

<p>Overall, this wasn't an easy experience, especially with the volume of work that goes into acting in a video game. Story aside, actors have to record a lot of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/interview/video-game-grunts-groans-and-screams-j-b-blanc-sheds-light-on-voice-acting" rel="nofollow">yelps and hints, along with combat grunts</a> and side quest musings.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"It was a 'marathon' as [creative director] Jonathan Dumont advised me in the beginning. I've learned a lot about advocating for recovery time and taking care of myself," she said. "But honestly, as challenging as it was, it was also a rewarding experience. I learned so much."</p>



<h2>A Sense of Pride</h2>

<p>Masumi herself doesn't play too many video games, but she did check out some of <em>Assassin's Creed Shadows</em> recently—I mean, why wouldn't she, after all that hard work?&nbsp;</p>

<p>"While it was beautiful and super exciting to watch Naoe and Yasuke's story, the fight scenes were a bit too violent for me to get through," she said with a laugh. "I can't watch bloody horror movies either, so I would just have to enjoy walking through the town with <em>Shadows</em>."&nbsp;</p>

<p>Still, there's a lot she should be proud of. <em>Assassin's Creed Shadows</em> is arguably one of the best in the franchise, with a healthy player base that has grown a lot since release. Additionally, it adds an extra sense of weight and honor to Masumi, being part of a game that showcases parts of Japanese history and culture.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"I feel so honored and grateful that people are interested in our culture," she said. "I hope this will entice people to come to Japan and explore the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/features/real-wabi-sabi-in-assassins-creed-shadows-open-world" rel="nofollow">beautiful cities and countrysides in Japan</a>!"&nbsp;</p>

            <p>The Last of Us Part 2 made its PC debut just yesterday, but already the game has been cracked.</p>
<p>As spotted by <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/the-last-of-us-part-2-pc-steam-playstation-cracked/">The Gamer</a>, video game pirates have found a way to get the game off Steam - its legitimate PC storefront - for torrenting, less than 24 hours since its release. Posts on social media reveal that the game is available from unofficial sources.</p>

</figure>
<p>This means that while The Last of Us Part 2 Remastered itself has 15,885 players on Steam at the time of writing, there are likely some players elsewhere given its unofficial PC availability - though it's hard to tell how much pirating has impacted sales so far.</p>
<p>The Last of Us 2 Remastered <a href="https://steamdb.info/charts/?compare=1888930,2531310">currently has a concurrent player peak of 23,350</a> on Valve's platform. To compare, The Last of Us Part 1 - which was released on PC in 2023, in a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/naughty-dog-knows-the-last-of-us-part-1-on-pc-hasnt-delivered-the-naughty-dog-quality-you-expected">rather sorry state</a> - has a Steam concurrent player peak of 36,496.</p>
<p>Digital Foundry took The Last of Us Part 2 out for a spin on PC ahead of its release. "It's a better game on launch than Part 1, but with some frustrating elements and a buggy feeling that's hard to shake," <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-the-last-of-us-part-2-a-better-pc-port-but-not-a-great-one">Alex Battaglia wrote following his time with The Last of Us Part 2 Remastered on PC</a>.</p>
<p>"Beyond the disappointingly high GPU requirements, the biggest complaint here are the frame-time spikes that occur even on high-end kit, which seems incongruous with the game's cinematic presentation."</p>
<p>Still, it doesn't look like any of Part 2's issues are going to get memed in the same way <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-many-pc-glitches-are-being-turned-into-memes">The Last of Us Part 1 did on its own PC release</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/inzoi-sales-1m<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Krafton's&nbsp;<em>Sims</em>-style life sim&nbsp;<em>inZoi&nbsp;</em>has reached a major sales milestone just a week after its initial launch in Early Access.</p>

<p><em>inZoi&nbsp;</em>was released last Friday, having been <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/inzoi-release-date-delayed" rel="nofollow">delayed out of 2024 back in November</a>, and according to a <a href="https://x.com/PlayinZOI/status/1908082411906449478" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on the game's official X account, it's already surpassed a million sales, a number Krafton says "feels unreal".</p>

<p>The developer thanks players who've bought the game so far, praising their "excitement", their fan creations, and the feedback they've provided so far, as well as the support they've given to <i>inZoi</i>. Krafton says it's "deeply grateful" for fans' "passion and love".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/inzoi-sales-1m-crowd.jpg?itok=wsCHYmbr 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/inzoi-sales-1m-crowd.jpg?itok=h21Jwf4j 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Krafton's&nbsp;<em>inZoi&nbsp;</em>has already reached a million sales.</figcaption></figure><p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>inZoi</em>, it's a life sim in the vein of games like EA's&nbsp;<em>The Sims</em>&nbsp;and...well...just&nbsp;<em>The Sims</em>, really. EA's franchise hasn't had much competition of late, and the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/life-by-you-paradoxs-sims-competitor-has-been-cancelled" rel="nofollow">cancellation of Paradox's&nbsp;</a><em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/life-by-you-paradoxs-sims-competitor-has-been-cancelled" rel="nofollow">Life by You</a>&nbsp;</em>didn't help on that front.</p>

<p>Krafton describes&nbsp;<em>inZoi&nbsp;</em>as "a fully functional community simulation experience" in which your role is to "shap[e] the world as [you] envision and [witness] the various stories that unfold".</p>

<p><em>inZoi</em>'s characters, known as Zois, will go about their lives according to their own whims, but you can shape their experience by altering their environment, and, of course, by <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sims-like-inzoi-character-creator-tool" rel="nofollow">customizing them</a> to your heart's content as well.</p>

<p>Today's sales milestone arguably shows not only that there's a real appetite for&nbsp;<em>Sims</em>-style experiences outside of EA's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ea-no-plans-the-sims-5" rel="nofollow">rather restrictive playpen</a>, but also that the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/krafton-generative-ai-characters-pubg-inzoi" rel="nofollow">presence of generative AI</a>, which Krafton has been talking up in&nbsp;<em>inZoi&nbsp;</em>for a while, hasn't hindered the game's popularity.</p>




<p>Unlike&nbsp;<em>The Sims</em>,&nbsp;<em>inZoi&nbsp;</em>is currently in Early Access, and Krafton <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2456740/view/512953841353754380" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">says</a> it has plans to introduce major updates for the game around every two months, although more pressing issues will be fixed on a more immediate basis "during April".</p>

<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>inZoi&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2456740/inZOI/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC via Steam</a>.</p>

		<p>It’s been far too long since Donkey Kong’s last 3D adventure, but Donkey Kong Bananza is about to set that right on Nintendo Switch 2. This is a big, brash, counterpart to Mario Odyssey, a smash-happy 3D platformer where it feels like anything and everything can be destroyed.</p>
<p><iframe title="Donkey Kong Bananza – Nintendo Direct | Nintendo Switch 2" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mIddsPkdX9U?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Playing through the opening stage of the game, we find DK down in the mines with all his simian pals, digging up gold nuggets while hunting for surprisingly tasty jewel-encrusted golden bananas to smash and gobble up. While everyone else is toiling away with pick axes, though, DK can just punch his way through the deformable scenery.</p>


<p>You know exactly what kind of game this is when you’ve got three different face buttons all dedicated to smashing in different ways. One will smash around you, another with punch down, and finally, you can punch upwards. Whether it’s enemies or deformable parts of the world, a lot of the time, things will just hurry up and get out of DK’s way when he punches.</p>
<p>It feels like something inspired by the likes of Red Faction or Deep Rock Galactic as you barrel your way through this opening stage, and there’s an initial thrill to the rambunctious chaos that you create in your surroundings. It doesn’t take too long to start to find the limits of what you can punch your way through, this underground level still having plenty of deformable terrain, but also unbreakable walls and floors boxing you in to keep things a little constrained – this underlying structure will ensure that you can’t get stuck.</p>

<p>Another of DK’s abilities is slapping the ground, both to trigger hidden elements on the floor to raise up – platforms, for example –&nbsp;and do a quick little sonar pulse to reveal nearby secrets hidden away in the dirt.</p>

<p>Jumping ahead to a later level at Ape Cape –&nbsp;after DK finds a huge haul of golden bananas, just in time for the villains to turn up and steal them all away, of course –&nbsp;and we’re out in the open and the bright sun. There’s some enemies you can’t actually smash here, flying Buzzoids that will damage you with their blade-like propeller if you get too close. Luckily you can just rip up big chunks of the ground and throw them at things that have offended you.</p>
<p>That can also include enemies that have encased themselves in rock and other matter, needing you to throw chunks of rock at them, or punch your way through to their skeletal forms inside before you can defeat them. They were featured in a mini battle arena, a little diversion from the main level as you fight multiple enemies against the clock. A longside fossils, buried treasure chest and other secrets,</p>
<p>Sometimes not even throwing ripped up rocks will do the trick – concrete is pretty much impervious to your regular attacks. That’s where the handy, shimmering purple explosive rocks come into play, sprouting from certain parts of the level. These are great for just blasting holes in the level and through heavier enemies, exploding on impact and doing a lot of damage. After going through a section of revolving concrete and finding it thoroughly unpunchable, I doubled back, grabbed some purple and embraced the TNT excavation technique of old.</p>

<p>The one problem with all the dig-punching is that it feels like the camera is a bit too close or not quite framed to DK to capture the world-smashing carnage you’re unleashing. It’s entirely possible to get a little bit lost in all the smashing and get turned around, especially when you’re in the tighter confines of the underground mine level. A neat trick that does work to keep you oriented, is when the camera can clip through the ground as you dig straight down and let you see the rest of the level, so you know where to dig towards to get yourself back out. I hope that longer play gets past this feeling, or that it can be tweaked through the final rounds of polish before release.</p>
<p>The game does look good, though. DK has that newer character style, similar to his appearance in the Super Mario Movie and in Mario Kart World, but still turns up to work in dungarees and a tie. That particular get up changed for the second level, and there’s bound to be plenty of costumes and dress up through the game.</p>
<p>There is quite a chunky feel to the deformation, but it’s good to see that even where you can’t dig through, say, the ape-shaped mountain of the second level, your punching does still often disturb a surface layer and give a little bit of visible, physical feedback.</p>

<p>If your kids are fans of Hulk smashing his way through earlier Avengers movies, then they’ll probably go bananas for Donkey Kong Bananza. As Nintendo and their partners explore platformers in all their forms, there’s some neat ideas built around the frenzy of punching and adding deformable world to the genre. I look forward to seeing how this can be explored in different ways, to hopefully avoid DK becoming a one punch ape.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/xbox-game-pass-2-billion-year-revenue/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>While there was some skepticism surrounding the Xbox Game Pass when it launched in 2017, players embraced the subscription model, which has been making solid revenue in the past few years.</p>
<p>As spotted by Timur222 on X, Richie Choudhary, former Head of Product at Xbox, revealed on their <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/richie-choudhary/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LinkedIn profile</a> that from 2019 until 2021, Xbox Game Pass stood at $2 billion a year in revenue, which is definitely an impressive figure, despite not being telling in regard to the sustainability of the subscription service, as there's no data on the profits.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Old but interesting<br>
Xbox Game Pass used to make $2 billion a year in revenue<a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Xbox?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Xbox</a> <a href="https://t.co/N5VEc0EBjH">pic.twitter.com/N5VEc0EBjH</a></p>
<p>— Timur222 (@bogorad222) <a href="https://twitter.com/bogorad222/status/1908089661349576714?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 4, 2025</a></p></blockquote>

<p>While Xbox Game Pass delivers quite a bit of value to players, it definitely causes a considerable drop in sales. <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-game-pass-games-lose-80-sales/">Earlier this year</a>, it was revealed that any game that is available as part of the subscription service's library can be expected to lose around 80% of its expected premium sales on Xbox, a little less if it is a big mainstream release. Still, certain games benefit from being part of the Game Pass library, such as multiplayer games, as a surge of players on Xbox systems can have a positive impact on sales on PlayStation consoles. The service also makes it easier for some developers to get players to try out their games.</p>
<p>Xbox Game Pass has become a fundamental part of Microsoft's strategy in the gaming space, which aims to get as many players as possible into the Xbox ecosystem, no matter the device. You can learn more about the subscription service on its <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-game-pass" target="_blank" rel="noopener">official website.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/bungie-reportedly-gearing-up-for-marathon-reveal-later-this-month/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>A reliable insider has claimed that Marathon might receive some sort of reveal next week.</p>



<p>Bungie recently <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marathon-news-being-teased-by-bungie/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">teased</a> Marathon on its social media accounts, hinting at a potential reveal in the coming days. Interestingly, Jeff Grubb also spoke about this topic during the latest episode of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y_7BU-Y6wdI" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Game Mess Decides</a> (via <a href="https://thegamepost.com/bungie-to-reveal-more-about-marathon-late-next-week/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">TheGamePost</a>). Grubb has stated that “late next week”, players will be able to finally learn “a lot more about Marathon”.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This is not Grubb’s first mention of an April reveal for Marathon. A few months ago, he stated that Marathon wasn’t a part of PlayStation’s State of Play event as it probably has its own thing because that’s how Bungie operates for Destiny, too. Grubb <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/why-bungies-marathon-wasnt-at-state-of-play/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">added</a>, “I think April [is] when we will probably hear from them about Marathon. And it would be its own thing separate from the State of Play.”</p>



<p>Bungie’s Marathon has been under wraps since its reveal at the PlayStation Showcase event. Since then, the only update we have received was a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/bungie-gives-official-update-on-status-of-marathon/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">dev talk</a> from the game director. However, we only heard about what was in the works in the game, along with some concept art for upcoming heroes. No actual gameplay was shown. If Marathon is revealed late next week, players will hope that the developers show up with a bunch of gameplay.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other news, Bungie’s Marathon <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/bungie-marathon-steam/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pre-order bonuses</a> were recently spotted on Steam. Also, according to claims, the dev’s upcoming ‘<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/bungies-upcoming-gummy-bears-moba-is-inspired-by-smash-bros-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gummy Bears’ MOBA</a> is inspired by Smash Bros. What are your thoughts on the Marathon being revealed later this month?

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/titanfall-3-2026-rumor/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>New rumors have surfaced that Titanfall 3 is in development and could be revealed in later this year with a 2026 release date.</p>



<p>It’s almost tradition at this point that a new Titanfall 3 rumor needs to surface annually, and this time, it suggests that the game is in development and could be revealed at this year’s The Game Awards, with a release date of 2026.</p>



<p>The recent rumours originate from two different Titanfall leakers, who, at face value, have got decent track records when it comes to reporting Apex Legends and Titanfall news.</p>



<p>Leaker,&nbsp;<a href="https://x.com/YOROTSUKI_" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">YOROTSUKI_</a>, was the first to make the claim and that back in December 2024, they teased in some discord servers that Respawn was working on a new game. Another Apex Legends leaker by the name of <a href="https://x.com/Osvaldatore" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Osvaldatore</a> then went on to corroborate the rumor with a tweet of a Titanfall 3 logo and had apparently spoken to YOROTSUKI being the scenes to verify that the game is indeed in development.</p>



<p>As for if the rumors are true or not remains to be seen (as always, take with a pinch of salt), but in the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@insider_gaming/videos" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Insider Gaming podcast</a> (released later today), we discuss the possibilities of the information being real and what we’ve heard. </p>



<p>According to our sources, Titanfall 3 has already been cancelled and shut down at least twice, with one of the reasons being given is because the game was “too similar to Titanfall 2”. That being said, Respawn Entertainment has had several unannounced projects cancelled in the past year, and probably needs another huge title other than Star Wars Jedi as the Apex Legends playerbase continues to dwindle. </p>



<p>As far as we know, at least three unannounced projects have been cancelled at Respawn in the past year, one was a single-player first-person shooter set in the Apex Legends universe, a second was a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/star-wars-mandalorian-game-canceled/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">single-player Mandalorian game</a>, and a third was an unannounced incubation project.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming has reached out to EA for comment and have contacted sources to see if the rumor has any legs.</p>



<p>Do you think Titanfall 3 is in development? Let me know in the comments or on the&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

That's a chunky 25% of the Switch 2’s internal storage.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Nintendo also recently confirmed that several new <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-confirms-some-switch-2-game-cards-will-only-include-a-download-key"><u>Switch 2 game cards won’t always carry an actual game</u></a>, but instead contain a key for a game download. This isn't the case for Cyberpunk 2077, though.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For context, one of the biggest games on the original Switch, The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, was just 16 GB.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s worth noting that the GameCube app’s size is expected to grow as new games are added to the library. At launch, the GameCube app contains The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker, F-Zero GX, and SoulCalibur 2.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Nintendo Switch 2 Game Boxes</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">So, how is the Nintendo Switch 2 able to get away with relatively small game sizes while offering up to 4K resolution?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In January, the internet spotted a Nintendo patent, filed July 2023 but published for the first time earlier this year, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-leaks-ramp-up-as-new-patent-suggests-ai-image-upscaling-tech"><u>that described AI image upscaling technology</u></a> that would help keep video game download sizes small enough to fit on a physical game cartridge while offering up to 4K textures. It was thought at the time that this applied to the Nintendo Switch 2, and could relate to Nvidia DLSS graphics technology.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Nvidia DLSS (Deep Learning Super Sampling) is an AI-powered technology that uses machine learning to upscale lower-resolution images in real-time, enhancing both performance and image quality in games.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This week, in the wake of the Nintendo Direct, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nvidia-says-its-custom-gpu-means-nintendo-switch-2-has-10x-the-graphics-performance-of-the-nintendo-switch">Nintendo and Nvidia confirmed the Switch 2’s custom GPU enables AI upscaling via DLSS and ray tracing</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Nvidia described it as a “custom Nvidia processor featuring an Nvidia GPU with dedicated RT Cores and Tensor Cores for stunning visuals and AI-driven enhancements.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Those upgrades include up to 4K gaming in TV mode and up to 120 FPS at 1080p in handheld mode. Nintendo Switch 2 also supports HDR, and AI upscaling “to sharpen visuals and smooth gameplay.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The new RT Cores bring real-time ray tracing, delivering “lifelike lighting, reflections and shadows for more immersive worlds,” Nvidia continued.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Tensor Cores, meanwhile, power AI-driven features like DLSS, “boosting resolution for sharper details without sacrificing image quality.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Details are thin on the ground, however. In a hardware-focused roundtable Q&amp;A in New York this week, attended by IGN, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-confirms-switch-2-uses-dlss-and-ray-tracing-but-is-being-super-vague-about-the-details"><u>Nintendo representatives confirmed the Switch 2 uses DLSS</u></a>, but did not specify which version of the tech, or whether it had been customized for Switch 2. It was a similarly vague response when Nintendo confirmed the Switch 2’s GPU is capable of ray tracing.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And what about the GPU itself? Tetsuya Sasaki, General Manager at Nintendo’s Technology Development Division, and Senior Director at its Technology Development Department, chimed in to say Nintendo prefers not to get in the weeds on things like the GPU.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Nintendo doesn't share too much on the hardware spec,” he said. “What we really like to focus on is the value that we can provide to our consumers. But I do believe that our partner Nvidia will be sharing some information.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For more, check out <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-direct-everything-announced"><u>everything announced at the Switch 2 Nintendo Direct</u></a>, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/heres-why-the-nintendo-switch-2-mario-kart-world-and-everything-around-them-is-so-expensive"><u>what the experts have to say about the Switch 2 price and Mario Kart World’s $80 price tag</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

It’s Destiny developer Bungie’s next game, and it looks like we’re about to finally see more of it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Marathon is a PvP-focused extraction shooter set on the mysterious planet of Tau Ceti IV. Players inhabit the bodies of Runners, cybernetic mercenaries who have been designed to survive the planet’s harsh environments, exploring the lost colony that once inhabited Tau Ceti’s surface.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It has been some time since we saw or heard of Marathon. In October, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bungie-shooter-marathon-is-on-track-but-too-early-in-development-to-show">Bungie released a lengthy development update <u>video</u> that shed light on Marathon's mechanics</a>, but stressed how early in development the game was. Player character models were, at that point, still "coming together," while enemy models were still in an "early state."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Now, though, half a year later, it looks like Bungie is finally ready to reveal what it’s been working on. A tweet from the official Marathon account, below, revealed a typically cryptic image and accompanying garbled signal noise. As fans have noticed, there’s ASCII art of footage from the debut Marathon trailer. Given this is Bungie we’re talking about, a developer known for its mysterious teasers, hidden clues, and Easter eggs, there’s probably much more here to discover, and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Marathon/comments/1jr6otv/unencrypted_code/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">fans are already working to find out what it all means</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Either way, it very much looks like it’s finally happening for Marathon after what has been a troubled development.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="zxx" dir="ltr"><a href="https://t.co/6NBgIdRVK2" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/6NBgIdRVK2</a></p>— Marathon (@MarathonTheGame) <a href="https://twitter.com/MarathonTheGame/status/1907956872046690602?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">April 4, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bungie-reveals-new-marathon-game-at-playstation-showcase"><u>Marathon was revealed in May 2023</u></a> as a reboot of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/4-ways-marathon-influenced-modern-games"><u>the classic Bungie franchise</u></a>, but with all its themes of "mysteries, eeriness, and psychological creepiness." But Bungie itself has suffered several controversies in recent years, headlined by <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/destiny-developer-bungie-cuts-220-staff-some-of-the-most-difficult-changes-weve-ever-had-to-make-as-a-studio"><u>the laying off of 220 staff members</u></a>, meaning 17% of its workforce, in July 2024: <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/games-industry-criticizes-bungie-management-ceo-pete-parsons-in-wake-of-layoffs-inexcusable"><u>a move even industry peers criticized</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This came <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pete-parsons-tells-employees-bungie-kept-the-right-people-to-work-on-destiny-2"><u>less than a year after 100 other layoffs at Bungie</u></a>, at which point <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bungie-devs-say-atmosphere-is-soul-crushing-amid-layoffs-cuts-and-fear-of-total-sony-takeover"><u>staff told IGN the atmosphere was "soul crushing" at the studio</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Further controversy came when a report released weeks after the 220 job losses alleging <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/marathon-director-was-fired-following-misconduct-investigation-at-bungie-report"><u>former Marathon director Chris Barrett was fired after an internal misconduct investigation</u></a> at Bungie. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/former-bungie-director-chris-barrett-suing-sony-interactive-entertainment-and-bungie-for-more-than-200-million">Barrett subsequently sued Sony Interactive Entertainment and Bungie for more than $200 million</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This all comes as Sony rethinks its focus on live-service games. Sony president Hiroki Totoki said in November 2023 <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-commits-to-launch-just-six-of-playstations-12-live-service-games-by-march-2026"><u>the company was committed to launching just six of the 12 live service games it was working on</u></a> by March 2026, in a shift in strategy that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-last-of-us-multiplayer-game-cancelled-will-focus-on-single-player-games-going-forward"><u>saw The Last of Us multiplayer game cancelled</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While Arrowhead’s Helldivers 2 was a breakout hit, becoming the fastest-selling PlayStation Studios game of all time with 12 million copies sold in just 12 weeks, Sony’s other live service games were either canceled or suffered disastrous launches.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Indeed, Sony’s Concord is one of the biggest video game disasters in PlayStation history, lasting just a couple of weeks before it was brought offline amid eye-wateringly low player numbers. Sony later decided to kill the game entirely and shut its developer.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And earlier this year, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/playstation-cancels-two-unannounced-live-service-games"><u>Sony reportedly canceled two unannounced live service games</u></a>, one a God of War title in development at Bluepoint, the other in the works at Days Gone developer Bend.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

                <p>While Nintendo isn't intending to market the Switch 2 as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-not-aimed-at-people-who-want-high-performance-hardware-nintendo-says/1100-6530572/" data-ref-id="1100-6530572">high-performance hardware</a>, the upcoming console still has quite a few new tricks up its sleeve, including Nvidia-powered DLSS upscaling and hardware ray tracing.</p><p>Nintendo confirmed the Switch 2's support for DLSS upscaling in a Q&amp;A session following the Switch 2 direct.

"Whether or not the software developer is going to use that as a native resolution or get it to a smaller res and then upscale is something that the software developer can choose. I think it opens up a lot of options for the software developer."</p><p>In the same session, Dohta confirmed that the Switch 2's GPU will support ray tracing, which "provides another option for software developers to use."</p><p>More details about the tech upgrades were revealed in a <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/nintendo-switch-2-leveled-up-with-nvidia-ai-powered-dlss-and-4k-gaming/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Nvidia blog post</a>, which provided a deep dive on the Switch 2's custom Nvidia processor. The console's GPU boasts dedicated RT Cores to power real-time ray tracing, while Tensor Cores are used for AI-powered boosts like DLSS upscaling. The Switch 2's AI processing also comes into play with the console's new video-chat feature, with AI-powered features including face tracking and automatic background removal.</p><p>Overall, Nvidia said the Switch 2 has 10 times the graphical performance of the Nintendo Switch, giving developers more to work with when developing games for the new console. Nintendo also announced during the Switch 2 Direct that the new console will support <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-will-support-hdr-4k-and-120fps/1100-6530547/" data-ref-id="1100-6530547">HDR, 4K, and 120fps</a>.</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-launches-june-5/1100-6530537/" data-ref-id="1100-6530537">Nintendo Switch 2 will launch on June 5</a> for $450, with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-preorder-guide-mario-kart-world-bundle/1100-6530531/" data-ref-id="1100-6530531">preorders beginning on April 9</a>.</p>

            <p>Nintendo's upcoming Switch 2 console doesn't actually run the original Switch's games natively, as the two hardwares are incompatible.</p>
<p>One of the first things that we knew for absolute certain about the Switch successor was that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-confirms-backwards-compatibility-for-switch-2">it would be backwards compatible</a>. "At today's Corporate Management Policy Briefing, we announced that Nintendo Switch software will also be playable on the successor to Nintendo Switch," company president Shuntaro Furukawa said in November.</p>
<p>But, while this means Switch 2 owners will still be able to play most of the games from the original Switch's library, this isn't possible because the two consoles are compatible at a hardware level, which would have been handy. Rather, it's all possible thanks to a workaround Nintendo has managed to implement.</p>

<p>During a recent <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/whatsnew/ask-the-developer-vol-16-nintendo-switch-2-part-4/">Ask the Developer Q&amp;A</a>, Nintendo's Kouichi Kawamoto said the Switch 2 team always wanted the new system to play the original console's games, but "were told there'd be technical challenges" getting it to work.</p>
<p>"When we first started Switch 2 development, the focus was on enhancing its performance as hardware, namely, expanding its capacity," added Takuhiro Dohta. "So, compatibility was a lower priority."</p>
<p>But, it was still something the team wanted to ensure, and in the end the Switch 2 developers settled on "the challenge of using new technology to run Switch games".</p>
<p>Said Dohta: "If we tried to use technology like software emulators, we'd have to run Switch 2 at full capacity, but that would mean the battery wouldn't last so long, so we did something that’s somewhere in between a software emulator and hardware compatibility."</p>
<p>The team goes through many checks to make sure original Switch games run smoothly on Switch 2, but the developers noted "it might not be that all Switch games run perfectly" in time for the console's launch this summer.</p>
<p>This method of playing older games <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnite-and-other-games-have-compatibility-issues-with-switch-2">explains why a few titles have some compatibility issues</a>, though fixes are in the works. And while only one Switch game is completely unplayable on Switch 2, others will still require the use of original Joy-Con due to specific controls or peripherals.</p>
<p>"But we will continue our efforts so that we can support as many Switch games as possible," Kawamoto said.</p>

			<p>The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion remake is still scheduled to be revealed and released this month, according to an extremely reliable insider.</p>
<p>A few hours ago, extremely reliable insider NateTheHate replied to a question regarding the remake, which was <a href="https://wccftech.com/oblivion-remake-could-be-mere-days-from-launch-according-to-leaker/">rumored</a> to launch yesterday, confirming that, as things stand, the game will still be released this month. Plans can obviously change, but with the insider's track record, it is safe to say that chances are high that we will soon be able to return to Cyrodiil soon, and experience it like we never did before.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">As things stand, yes.</p>
<p>— NateTheHate2 (@NateTheHate2) <a href="https://twitter.com/NateTheHate2/status/1907919010387370215?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 3, 2025</a></p></blockquote>

<p>While The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion remake has yet to be officially announced, we have known it has been in development in some capacity for <a href="https://wccftech.com/oblivion-fallout-3-remasters-leaked-alongside-dishonored-3-ghostwire-tokyo-sequel-and-more/">almost two years</a>, when the game's existence was revealed in an FTC investigational hearing held with Xbox's head Phil Spencer. According to <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remake-rumors-intensify-as-details-on-the-improvements-emerge-in-new-report/">rumors,</a> the remake is being developed by Virtuos in <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remake-unreal-engine-5/">Unreal Engine 5</a> and will feature many new features and improvements over the original, including combat mechanics changes, some of them inspired by modern action games, HUD improvements, and more. If all of these changes will indeed be implemented in the final game, they should make for a far more enjoyable experience.</p>
<p>Those who haven't experienced The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion ahead of the remake still have the chance to do so on PC, as the GOTY edition, including all additional content, is now available on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/22330/The_Elder_Scrolls_IV_Oblivion_Game_of_the_Year_Edition/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam</a>. Console players, unfortunately, have no other option at the moment other than playing the game on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.</p>

<p>Krafton has announced that inZOI has passed 1 million units sold in its first week of launch in early access on Steam.</p>



<p>In a press release, it was also said that “Canvas,”&nbsp;inZOI’s in-game UGC (User-generated Content) sharing platform, showed strong levels of community engagement as it garnered more than 1.2 million players on the day of launch with over 470,000 pieces of uploaded content.</p>



<p>CEO CH Kim stated, “We are grateful and excited to present&nbsp;inZOI&nbsp;to players around the world through Early Access,” adding, “We will continue to actively communicate with players and foster&nbsp;inZOI&nbsp;as KRAFTON’s long-term franchise IP.”</p>



<p>The press release concluded by reiterating that the game’s future updates will introduce new content, including mod support and new cities, with all updates and DLC provided for free until full release.</p>

<p>inZOI’s success hasn’t been without controversy, though. On launch, clips started going viral showing players being able to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/inzoi-lets-you-run-over-children/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">run over children within the game</a>, an issue that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/inzoi-developers-say-ability-to-run-over-children-was-a-bug/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Krafton quickly addressed and called a bug</a>.</p>



<p>inZOI currently sits at around 25,000 concurrent players in the past 24 hours, with 87,000 being the peak concurrent player count.</p>

		<p>Oh man, not only is the sun shining, but Nintendo are shining down on us too with the glorious reveal of all the Switch 2 details you could want (apart from pesky things like what chipset it’s rocking or the amount of RAM, but who needs to know that when there’s Mario Kart!). The battle is now on for pre-orders, and ShopTo have already told me I’m not in there first allocation. This has caused panic, but I’m sure that when the Nintendo store invites roll out I’ll be there. Surely, I’ll be there.</p>
<p>So this week, I asked the team what they were playing, and whether they were going to jump right into the Switch 2, hold off, or just play on the consoles they already have!</p>
<p><strong>Aran</strong> has played Croc for review, saying, “I found it pretty average. I’m currently playing Blue Prince for review and I’ll have more on that next week. Regarding the Switch 2, I won’t be getting one. I have a Switch that was barely used and I just don’t have the time I used to have to be able to keep up with games on multiple consoles anymore. I’m still playing Witcher 3 and I started that back in November!”</p>

<p><strong>Nic B</strong> has returned from Japan, and has dipped his toe into Monster Hunter Wilds in anticipation of Mizutsune (coming soon) and MTG Arena in anticipation of Tarkir (also coming soon). He says, “It’s gonna be a good month for games I like, but boy do I miss Japan already! As for the Switch 2, I’ll get one as soon as I can, but I doubt I’ll be in the preorder list as I haven’t had Switch Online for two years straight (I let it lapse when I have nothing to play online)!”</p>

<p><strong>Gamoc</strong> has played Balatro, Phasmo, Assassin’s Creed Shadows and Hitman regrettably not in VR. When asked about the Switch 2, he simply said, “Price increases on games sucks.”</p>
<p><strong>Jim</strong> is still very much in his ‘play one game at a time’ mode so he’s been putting a few more hours into Assassin’s Creed Shadows. He told us, “I wasn’t really vibing with the gameplay and open-ended story progression but something seems to have clicked – getting to this point has taken longer than what I would have liked but there’s a lot of fun to be had stalking the cities and castles of feudal Japan as Naoe, then bull-rushing everything as Yasuke.”</p>

<p><strong>Ade</strong> has been thoroughly enjoying Atomfall, saying, “It’s just a brilliant setting and great characters make it a joy to explore. Combat is perfunctory but the amount of dialogue options and accompanying meaningful choices that have genuine impact on the world more than make up for that. I’ve also just started on Commandos Origins for review. I’m not gonna pre-order a Switch 2, mostly because I’m poor. Though I’m sure I’ll eventually pick one up when Nintendo’s brilliant first-party stuff starts coming through.”</p>
<p><strong>Tuffcub</strong> has been playing the required Destiny 2, but also Black Myth Wukong which he says, “Is how games should be, nice short intro with stabby bits and not too long to get in to the game, and Indika in which I go against type and play as a nun. It’s very atmospheric.”</p>
<p><strong>Steve</strong> has also been enjoying Atomfall, whilst persevering with the ridiculous amount of collectables in Lego Skywalker and getting stuck into Metroid Dread. He says, “I’ve got a load of Switch games I’ve yet to play so no plans to pick up a Switch 2 any time soon – especially as many of the things it has to offer can already be done by my Steam Deck.”</p>
<p><strong>Tef</strong> meanwhile, has been out in Paris playing on the Switch 2 in real life! He has lots of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/04/nintendo-switch-2s-joy-con-mouse-mode-is-a-literal-game-changer/">thoughts</a> and words about it, all of which you can find on TSA over the next few days.</p>
<p>How about you? What have you played? And were you impressed enough by the Switch 2 Direct?</p>
