            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dead-by-daylight-castlevania-crossover-release-date<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Behaviour Interactive has revealed the&nbsp;<em>Dead by Daylight Castlevania&nbsp;</em>crossover release date, as well as unmasking the killer and survivor you can expect to play as when it arrives.</p>
<p>Originally revealed as part of the game's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dead-by-daylight-crossovers-spinoffs">eighth anniversary celebrations</a>,&nbsp;<em>Dead by Daylight</em>'s&nbsp;<em>Castlevania&nbsp;</em>crossover will arrive on August 27th, but you can check it out right now via the game's public test branch if you want to.</p>
<p>As you might expect, the killer being added to&nbsp;<em>Dead by Daylight&nbsp;</em>as part of the&nbsp;<em>Castlevania&nbsp;</em>crossover is none other than Dracula, and he brings with him the ability to shapeshift into three different forms with distinct abilities.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dead-by-daylight-castlevania-crossover-dracula.jpg?itok=rh1ec8Qz 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dead-by-daylight-castlevania-crossover-dracula.jpg?itok=rnHqvc3K 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Dracula is&nbsp;<em>Dead by Daylight</em>'s&nbsp;<em>Castlevania</em>-themed killer.</figcaption></figure><p>Dracula's Vampire form can use a damaging fire spell, while his Wolf form is capable of tracking enemies more effectively and moving more swiftly. He can also transform into a bat, giving him the Undetectable status and giving him the ability to teleport to vault points within 32 meters.</p>
<p>His survivor counterpart is none other than vampire hunter Trevor Belmont, scion of the Belmont clan and star of Netflix's&nbsp;<em>Castlevania&nbsp;</em>show (although not its newest spinoff, <i>Nocturne</i>, which stars Richter Belmont instead).</p>
<p>Trevor's perks allow him to see the killer when completing a generator, upgrade his items, and heal after opening chests, so he's a good choice if you're looking for a scrappy survivor who can fend for themselves.</p>
<p>You can take a look at the&nbsp;<em>Dead by Daylight Castlevania&nbsp;</em>trailer, which gives a glimpse of both Dracula and Trevor, right here.</p>

<p><em>Castlevania&nbsp;</em>is the latest in a long string of crossovers for&nbsp;<em>Dead by Daylight</em>. Others include&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dead-by-daylight-tomb-raider-crossover"><em>Tomb Raider</em></a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dead-by-daylight-alan-wake-crossover"><em>Alan Wake</em></a>, and the recently-announced&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dead-by-daylight-five-nights-at-freddys-crossover"><em>Five Nights at Freddy's&nbsp;</em>crossover</a>, although that's not coming for a while yet.</p>
<p><em>Dead by Daylight</em>'s&nbsp;<em>Castlevania&nbsp;</em>crossover arrives for all players on August 27th. You can check out the full patch notes for the corresponding update <a href="https://forums.bhvr.com/dead-by-daylight/kb/articles/465" rel="noopener" target="_blank">right here</a>.</p>

As the wait lengthens for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hollow-knight-silksong">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a>, other Soulsy creature features are scurrying to fill the breach. We had <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/deviator">Deviator</a> last week - now, it's time for a bumper helping of the heebie-jeebies in the shape of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/perennial-order">Perennial Order</a>. The title makes it sound like an eBay delivery of potted geraniums. The game festering beneath is actually a "plant horror" boss rusher with twin stick melee controls, unlockable "Instinct" abilities and one-hit deaths.</p>
<p>In a gift to headline writers everywhere, the developers, four-person Gardenfiend Games, are calling it "Hollow Knight meets Titan Souls", and who am I to deny them? It's got one of those "painterly" art styles, too, though other words come to mind, such as "rotted" and "unhallowed" and "manky". It's out on 6th September. Find a trailer nested below this paragraph like a venus flytrap poised to clamp around your fingers.

The last boss rusher I seriously got into was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/furi">Furi</a> from The Game Bakers. This looks considerably less joyful, assuming you don't find joy in squirming egg sacs or nodachi-wielding toadstools. I will admit to deriving pleasure from the spectacle of a giant skeleton boss who plays chess with squelchy animate pieces, but only because I'd much rather fight a bony boardgamer than the bright-eyed, tentacle-nosed clot of darkness that pursues you elsewhere in the trailer. There are touches of bullet hell, too, albeit with roaches rather than bullets.
</p>
<p>
The developers cite Dark Souls as an influence, but don't expect nearly as much backtracking. Perennial Order lets you respawn right at the beginning of each encounter, so as to "spend your time fighting rather than walking". That said, there's apparently a world beyond the bosses, with NPCs to pester and lore to sponge from secluded nooks. More "boss rush focussed" than "boss rush", perhaps. You can get help from a friend, too: there's optional co-op throughout.
</p>
<p>
Again, it's out 6th September. There's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1411020/Perennial_Order/">a demo on Steam</a>, if you can't wait to sink your boot into this belching swamp of genre references.

Those in attendance duly oblige.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Brin briefly took the podium (Hyper Talk speakers only have five minutes to blitz through a topic) to discuss why AI has contributed to the "clusterfuck" that has become the video game industry. She suggests the technology itself isn't the problem, but rather the "overhyped expectations" that have convinced studio heads it can replace human creativity.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"First of all, I want to talk to you a little bit about creativity–and creativity, just in case you didn't know, isn't something you're born with or not," says Brin. "Creativity doesn't just mean being good at art. It's a whole set of holistic skills that I do not have time to unpack for you, so I want to talk about once core concept, and that's the concept of theft."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Brin is specifically referring to the concept of theft as </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://austinkleon.com/2018/01/11/good-theft-vs-bad-theft/">described by artist and writer Austin Kleon</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, who explains that while "imitation is&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>not</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">&nbsp;flattery. It’s&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>transformation</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">&nbsp;that is flattery: taking what you’ve stolen and turning it into something&nbsp;</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>new."</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"He explains that part of finding your voice as a creative is about borrowing and sampling and copying the people you really admire. As he outlines here's there's good stuff: honor, study, steal from many," Brin says. "[Then there's] bad theft: not giving credit, plagiarising, and ripping off. When it comes to AI, it's an example of bad theft. At least as it stands now, because there's no way of giving credit."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Offering up some evidence, Brin displays the work of D&amp;D artist Greg Rutkowski, whose work has been copied more than Picasso through AI tools like Midjourney without him ever receiving a credit (</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-66099850">more on that here from BBC News</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">).</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Because of the way the [Midjourney] LLM is set up there's no way to give Rutkowski credit or monetary reimbursement for the work that's been fed into the model. So where does that leave the artist and game developers?," she asks</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"I would say that many entry-level positions in the game industry as well as those higher up are at risk because of cost-cutting measures. So what do we do? First of all we need to start being responsible about how we put together datasets. We need more mechanisms for attribution. So, the question I want to pose to you today, rather than 'can AI replace human creativity?,' is can AI create with humans in interesting ways as part of the creative process–not a replacement for it?"</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Getting a little bit philosophical, Brin leans on a theory of play that that emphasises a "dialogue between audience and content," and says we should emulate that dialogue when considering how to combine creative production, AI, and games.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Creativity is interplay between humans and their tools, but we have to protect people and workers. We want to build a strong thriving economy in which we can enjoy the work we love to do but also not live in a robotic dystopia," she continues. "How do we protect and promote human creativity? We organize."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Brin is referencing the ongoing efforts of unions across a number of industries that are working to secure AI protections, preventing major companies from deploying the technology in unethical, debilitating ways. SAG–AFTRA's </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/sag-aftra-performers-to-hold-first-strike-picket-outside-wb-games">recent decision to strike</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> in a bid to protect video game performers from AI tools is just one instance of how that collective power can manifest.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Our activism and protecting our creative practice and our craft [isn't just about what] we do in here together as a community. We actually need to get out there and push for legislation and policy recommendations to protect our economic and social futures," she adds.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">For Brin, it's on workers to "move the needle" as a collective and deliver the protections creative industries are crying out for. "If you're not already familiar or are part of a union, please join one." She closes by demanding a rousing "hell yeah" in favor of a better, brighter future for creativity in games.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/a-quiet-place-the-road-ahead-launches-17-october/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>A Quiet Place is known for being a great horror franchise, with the premise revolving around staying as quiet as possible to avoid attracting the attention of Death Angels. The movie franchise is getting a <a href="https://wccftech.com/a-quiet-place-the-road-ahead-is-a-single-player-horror-game-out-in-2024-made-by-stormind-games/">new addition</a>, but this time it's in the gaming sphere. A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead launches 17 October.</p>
<p>This upcoming title is being developed by the Italian developer Stormind Games, the creators of games such as Batora: Lost Haven and the Remothered franchise. The game is being published by Saber Interactive, the publishers for games such as Vampyr, The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt and Kingdom Come: Deliverance.</p>
<p>For those wanting to know more about A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead, a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=riegOv5eRuY" target="_blank" rel="noopener">50 second trailer</a> has been released on YouTube, showcasing some of the survival horror elements that players can expect to run into. From doors slamming shut and alerting the Death Angels, to having to try and shuffle away from them as they are on high alert searching for you, A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead looks like it'll be the perfect game for those who were fans of Alien: Isolation.</p>
<p>A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead is a spin-off from the movie franchise, where you play as a character who has asthma, which, just by using the inhaler is enough to alert the Death Angels to her presence. She is going through interpersonal family conflict, and must deal with her emotions of that while navigating an apocalyptic world.</p>
<p>For those that haven't seen the movies, the Death Angels use sound to locate their prey, and have a heightened sense of hearing, meaning they can hear every little noise you make. In this survival horror game, that may be the thing that makes or breaks her survival.</p>
<p>If you are interested in purchasing A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead, the game will be released on October 17 and will cost $29.99. Pre-orders for the game are currently available, which will allow those who have pre-ordered to get exclusive content in the game and get their hands on some digital art from the upcoming video game.</p>
<p>In addition to the trailer, the developers also released a 10-minute game play video in July, a video that is exclusive to IGN. In <a href="https://www.ign.com/videos/a-quiet-place-the-road-ahead-10-minutes-of-exclusive-gameplay" target="_blank" rel="noopener">this video</a>, you get to see the protagonist navigate Northwood Hospital, where she has to overcome her own fears in order to survive the horrors of the post-apocalyptic world she has been plunged into.</p>

<p>In a new <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xNl2r_WHpcU" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">celebration video</a>, No More Robots announced Descenders Next with a release window set for “early 2025.”</p>



<p>Descenders Next will feature a variety of different sports, adding both snowboarding and mountain boarding. Today’s new video showcased early alpha footage of both. Each additional sport will come with its own biome. </p>



<p>Descenders Next will introduce even more sports “as free updates.” The maps for each biome will feature larger maps, races, challenges, and some “boss jumps.” Procedurally generated nodes will also changed based on timelines rather than player entry.</p>

<p>Today’s reveal trailer also confirms that multiplayer will be available at launch, and players can group up in lobbies. However, solo will still be available anytime. </p>



<p>The trailer also teases Career and Parks modes merging, customization, and other central features.</p>



<p>No More Robots added that “we’ll be running test sessions in the coming months,” so players can sign up now. However, Descenders Next will also appear as a playable game at this year’s Gamescom, ahead of its 2025 launch.</p>



<p>In the meantime, the original Descenders game also has a new update, which is coming to consoles soon. There will also be more updates on Descenders Next via Discord “on a weekly basis.” </p>



<p>No More Games only confirmed PC and Xbox platforms for Descenders Next in today’s trailer. It also teases the Xbox Game Pass, hinting it may join on day one. The original Descenders did join the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/every-xbox-game-pass-core-game-confirmed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Xbox Game Pass core tier</a> in 2023.</p>

It will be available via the Steam public test build on August 6. <span id="more-903831"></span></p><p>“We wanted to create a fluidity in the way players can have Dracula change between his different forms and have it feel seamless,” said Dead by Daylight creative director Dave Richard in a press release. “When I first played <em>Symphony of the Night</em>—which is one of my favorite games of all time—having vampiric powers like these was absolutely amazing. Being able to put players in the shoes of The Dark Lord in <em>Dead by Daylight</em> was an alluring and unique opportunity for us.”</p><p>Get the details below.</p><blockquote><p><strong>An Immortal Franchise</strong></p><p>It’s difficult to think back to a time in gaming without Castlevania, one of the most iconic series from <a title="Companies > Konami Digital Entertainment [1,073 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/konami">Konami Digital Entertainment</a>‘s (Konami). First released in 1986 on the Famicom Disk System in Japan, then on the <a title="Platforms > Nintendo [20,558 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/nintendo">Nintendo</a> Entertainment System in 1987 and going strong ever since, the <em>Castlevania</em> franchise boasts a legacy almost as enduring as that of its main villain.</p><p>For many—those on the <em>Dead by Daylight</em> team included—the original <em>Castlevania</em> in all its 8-bit glory represented an early introduction to <a title="Genres > Horror [447 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/horror">horror</a> gaming. Countless titles, a hit animated series, and decades of intricate lore later, <em>Castlevania</em> continues to ascend the pantheon of horror with its arrival in <em>Dead by Daylight</em>.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>Dracula’s powers and those of his castle are inextricably linked, and The Entity has brought both into its realm. Any time Dracula is the featured Killer in a Trial with an Original Map, players will see the ominous castle looming over the proceedings, perched on the horizon of that Map. The powers it bestows upon its master are enough to make even the most grizzled Survivor’s blood run cold.</p><p><strong>Deadly as the Wolf. Swift as the Bat.</strong></p><p>With Castlevania’s Dracula, Dead by Daylight welcomes both its first shapeshifting Killer, as well as its first vampire to The Fog. Regal, imposing, and wholly terrifying, Dracula’s disdain for humankind is matched only by his bloodlust—making The Entity’s Realm a perfect hunting ground for the nightwalker.</p><p>It is said the Dark Lord can take many forms, each one proficient in tracking and killing victims. As a Vampire he stalks his prey, able to conjure flames that sear flesh and render bone to ash. The Bat is as quiet as a creeping shadow, approaching at a moment’s notice and gaining ground with a blink. The Wolf is a relentless hunter, with a keen nose for fresh blood—even that which has yet to be spilled…</p><p><strong>Survivor’s Bloodline</strong></p><p>Tormented, exiled, and even cursed some say, the Belmont bloodline has stood between humanity and the forces of darkness for countless generations. Yet perhaps, no descendant of this clan is better equipped to take on The Entity’s Realm than new Survivor, Trevor Belmont.</p><p>First introduced in 1989’s <em>Castlevania III: Dracula’s Curse</em>, Trevor may not be the brawniest Belmont, but his unique skillset serves to set him apart. From an innate ability to seek out allies and work as part of a team, to his unmatched skills as a vampire hunter, his values and will exemplify what makes the Belmont clan who they are.</p></blockquote><p><em>Dead by Daylight</em> is available now for <a title="Platforms > PS5 [7,587 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps5">PlayStation 5</a>, <a title="Platforms > Xbox Series [5,775 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/xbox/xbox-series">Xbox Series</a>, <a title="Platforms > PS4 [27,013 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps4">PlayStation 4</a>, <a title="Platforms > Xbox One [13,365 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/xbox/xbox-one">Xbox One</a>, <a title="Platforms > Switch [15,745 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/nintendo/switch">Switch</a>, and <a title="Platforms > PC [20,804 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/381210/Dead_by_Daylight/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Steam</a>, <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/p/dead-by-daylight" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Epic Games Store</a>, and <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/dead-by-daylight-windows/9nms4sfnbgbh" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Microsoft Store</a>.</p><p>Watch a new trailer below.</p><h2><span><em>Castlevania</em> Chapter Official Trailer</span></h2><p><iframe title="Dead by Daylight | Castlevania | Official Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tQWEWR4V-m0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

It'll likely make a great addition to bookshelves too, as its colorful, abstract cover is a gorgeous piece of artwork.

<p>There's already around 35-40 hours to enjoy in the game, according to NPC Studio, but&nbsp;<em>Fields of Mistria</em>'s first update is already scheduled for the fourth quarter of 2024, although its exact date has yet to be determined.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/fields-of-mistria-roadmap-first-update.jpg?itok=nyKCyOox 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/fields-of-mistria-roadmap-first-update.jpg?itok=ghNzTe4X 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The first&nbsp;<em>Fields of Mistria&nbsp;</em>update is due to arrive later this year.</figcaption></figure><p>The game's first update will raise the NPC heart progression cap and add new NPC dialogue, and it'll also bring new enemies and cosmetic loot for the monsters in the mines and dungeon.</p>
<p>You can also look forward to new renown rewards and board requests in town, as well as a raised skill cap level, new perks, and new upgrades for your home, plus more. All of that is coming to the game in its first update.</p>
<p>In the future, NPC Studio says it wants to further raise the heart cap and add new events for romanceable NPCs, and that new mine and dungeon biomes, perks, and home upgrades are also on the way later down the line.</p>
<p>As if all of that wasn't enough, you'll also be able to ride large animals and keep pets, so if you're an animal lover, just hold on a little longer and all of your dreams could potentially come true.</p>

<p>If you're not across&nbsp;<em>Fields of Mistria</em>, it's a bright, nostalgic pixel art-based life and farming sim with an anime-inspired aesthetic. It's a deliberate homage to the farming sim-style RPGs of the 90s and beyond, so expect shades of&nbsp;<em>Harvest Moon&nbsp;</em>(now&nbsp;<em>Story of Seasons</em>),&nbsp;<em>Rune Factory</em>, and more.</p>
<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Fields of Mistria&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2142790/Fields_of_Mistria/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC via Steam Early Access</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fortnite-fall-guys-crossover<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Epic has announced a&nbsp;<em>Fortnite Fall Guys&nbsp;</em>crossover, bringing the chaotic jellybeans into the battle royale game's world via a brand new obstacle course and the chance to make&nbsp;<em>Fall Guys</em>-themed maps in Creative mode.</p>
<p><em>Fortnite</em>'s Where We Fallin' event sees a new&nbsp;<em>Fall Guys</em>-themed obstacle course appearing in the skies over the game's map. To access it, you'll have to find a golden Bean Idol, several of which are "hidden" in the Classy Courts area.</p>
<p>Once you've found one, you'll be transported to the&nbsp;<em>Fall Guys&nbsp;</em>obstacle course. Completing it in time will give you the chance to earn Locker items like a&nbsp;<em>Fall Guys&nbsp;</em>jellybean plushie. Awww.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/fortnite-fall-guys-crossover-jellybean-plushie.jpg?itok=XUPZOPT2 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/fortnite-fall-guys-crossover-jellybean-plushie.jpg?itok=lAxXFqGP 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>You could have one of these for your very own.</figcaption></figure><p>Naturally, it wouldn't be much of an obstacle course if your&nbsp;<em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em>character didn't morph into a cute little jellybean, and certain outfits, like Brite Bomber and Jonesy the Secondst, will even have their own custom jellybeans. Sadly, if you're not an original&nbsp;<em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em>character, you'll just be a default bean.</p>
<p>As well as&nbsp;<em>Fall Guys&nbsp;</em>making an appearance in&nbsp;<em>Fortnite</em>, you can now also <a href="https://create.fortnite.com/news/create-fall-guys-islands-in-fortnite-with-uefn-and-creative?team=personal" rel="noopener" target="_blank">create and publish</a> your very own&nbsp;<em>Fall Guys</em>-themed islands in Creative mode and UEFN using "a massive selection of&nbsp;<em>Fall Guys&nbsp;</em>obstacles and props".</p>
<p>To kickstart your creativity,&nbsp;<em>Fall Guys&nbsp;</em>developer Mediatonic has made three of its own maps, which you can play with the following codes.</p>
<ul><li>Falling Up: 4185-8103-4745</li>
<li>Tumble Towers: 1985-3300-5865</li>
<li>Blunderdome Blast: 7671-9041-8194</li>
</ul><p>Additionally, three extra&nbsp;<em>Fall Guys</em>-themed stages have been created by Mediatonic in conjunction with Studio 568 and Spiral House, and the codes for those are as follows.</p>
<ul><li>Hex-A-Gone Unlimited: 2214-7960-2047</li>
<li>Bean Circuit: 0057-3389-4313</li>
<li>Pegwin Pickup: 7485-7322-4774</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Fall Guys</em>' appearance in&nbsp;<em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em>makes a certain degree of sense considering that Mediatonic was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fall-guys-developer-mediatonic-acquired-by-epic-games">acquired by Epic Games back in 2021</a>, but it's far from the only crossover to be featured in the phenomenally popular battle royale game.</p>
<p>Other properties to have made the jump include&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/star-wars-fortnite-may-2024"><em>Star Wars</em></a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/new-fortnite-my-hero-academia-crossover"><em>My Hero Academia</em></a>, and&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fortnite-futurama-crossover"><em>Futurama</em></a>, plus many, many more.&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Fortnite</em>'s penchant for crossovers is also arguably the reason for the existence of&nbsp;<em>Lego Fortnite</em>, a&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/lego-fortnite-debuts-with-over-23-million-concurrent-players-will-get-updates-in-early"><em>Minecraft</em>-style survival-crafting experience</a>&nbsp;that recently <a href="https://x.com/LEGOFortnite/status/1820763375757893718" rel="noopener" target="_blank">got an update adding fast travel</a>&nbsp;to its massive blocky world.</p>

            <p>Okay, listen. The Roads To Power expansion coming to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/crusader-kings-iii">Crusader Kings III</a> is focusing on the Byzantine Empire. But forget that. Because today developers Paradox revealed the ins and outs of another feature from the DLC that is way more exciting than some fusty old Greeks. It's called "landless adventurers" and it'll let you play as disgraced dirtbag travelling the world in a sort of medieval gig economy. You'll be making camp, gathering followers, taking random jobs from local rulers, and catching infectious diseases as you try to travel safely through war-torn regions. It sounds amazing.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Simply put, you’ll be able to create a custom "Landless Adventurer" character at the start of a campaign, just like designing a normal ruler (you might also find yourself landless mid-game following some classic political turmoil). At this point, you'll be expected to play the game a little differently than normal. </p>
<p>"Crusader Kings is a game about marriage, inheritance, and complex realm politics; none of which really apply to wandering characters with nary a vassal to call their own," say Paradox in <a href="https://forum.paradoxplaza.com/forum/developer-diary/dev-diary-151-landless-adventurers-part-i.1697815/">a lengthy developer diary</a>. "Well, simply put, we think of [adventurers] as the ultimate underdogs: outsiders with no land or prospects, but also no responsibilities or restrictions...</p>
<p>"We wanted to reflect this philosophy with a play style focused on travel and roaming, encouraging you to experience the map in a different way by moving across and spectating it — occasionally stopping to influence this realm or that when you have to proverbially sing for your supper."</p>
<figure>
<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/crusader-kings-3-landless-adventurers-4.jpg?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">
 </a>
<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Paradox Interactive</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>That travel takes the form of making camp. You pick a region and set up camp there, at which point you'll be offered "contracts" - various odd jobs that range in difficulty and payout. Some contracts will see you help out in a war (provided you have the soldiers trailing along with you). Others might have you assisting the local ruler's councillors in some scheme or plot, or collecting taxes from reluctant locals, or educating a noble's child. </p>
<p>"Some require no travel, some require you to travel the length of the map, while others might involve a small tour of a character’s realm," say the developers. "Naturally, a core part of this is servicing the fantasy of forming a strong, mobile mercenary army, but we also didn’t want players to be restricted to just this. For every Roger de Flor, there’s an Ibn Battuta or a Marco Polo, after all."</p>
<p>Having read Ibn Battuta's travels, I love this idea. I, too, want to upset a despotic Sultan in India. I, too, wish to be mugged on the road an inconceivable number of times. (The developers say that the "travel safety mechanics" will be the same as those introduced in previous expansion Tours &amp; Tournaments.) To generate new contracts, you'll have to stay on the move, hopping from one de jure region to another in search of the next gig. </p>
<figure>
<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/crusader-kings-3-landless-adventurers-5.jpg?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">
 </a>
<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Paradox Interactive</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>"If you complete a contract to your employer’s satisfaction, you’ll receive resources like gold, prestige, sometimes piety, and the new Adventurer-specific provisions... Prestige is needed to advance your fame, which both governs the tier of rulers who’ll offer you contracts (kings and emperors won’t hand them out to just anybody)."</p>
<p>If any of this sounds familiar, it feels a lot like the mercenary wandering of the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mount-blade-ii-bannerlord">Mount &amp; Blade</a> games, throwing your lot in with a distant duke before upping sticks to go charm the neighbouring Khan's daughter. Just like those games, you'll also need to keep a healthy stack of food and supplies (those "provisions" mentioned above). If you start running low, followers will start to lose their opinion of you, and starvation will eventually kick in. But it may not come to that. You may become a prestigious wanderer, prompting the chance to earn yourself a landed title.</p>
<p>"Landing yourself should be possible (especially if you’re willing to take the indignity of an impoverished, remote county somewhere), but not something you can do with a click of your fingers and no prep work," say the devs.</p>
<p>"We do expect some players to want to be adventurers for as little time as possible, and others to want to be them for centuries at a time. Off-ramps are provided at various stages for players who decide they want to leave the life of an Adventurer. It’s up to you if you’d be happy taking a back-water county somewhere in exchange for a huge sum of cash, building an army to try retaking your throne, or simply drift around the world making your mark in a half a dozen small ways."</p>
<p>The post shares an example of exactly that, detailing a playthrough featuring a landless Kashmiri schemer called Shirin who "longs to explore far from home". It's worth a read if you still want finer details of how certain contract types will play out (a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDl-F0OYOP8">video version is also available</a>). At one point, she takes a transport contract, meaning to escort a Baron westwards, only to discover that Persia is in the midst of the Iranian Intermezzo, a huge and prolonged struggle that probably will not clear up by tomorrow. </p>
<figure>
<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/crusader-kings-3-landless-adventurers-3.jpg?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">
 </a>
<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Paradox Interactive</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>"Along the way," the dev explains, "danger events bedevil us, [my follower] Lalit manages to lose some provisions and get beaten up in a tavern fight, and I caught typhus."</p>
<p>Yes. YES. This is exactly the kind of stuff I long for in a CKIII game. Travel! Excitement! Accidentally dropping all your food into a puddle of excrement at the side of the road! </p>
<p>There are a bunch of other contract types, including ones based on intrigue and stewardship. But there are also jobs allowing for criminal actions like arson, murder or robbery, essentially making you a travelling bandit. At some point you'll be able to "wipe the slate" clean with a donation of gold and prestige, should you want to clean up and go straight again.</p>
<p>There are a lot more differences in playstyle when compared to a landed noble. Skill trees will be different, for example, and the grandiose feasts and weddings of the gentry are replaced with campfire revelries. You'll also have to invest in camp upgrades, in order to unlock other traditionally available features. Like creating a portable shrine to allow for converting religions. And, perhaps most importantly, succession becomes far more "informal" and simple: your oldest child or closest relative will take the lead. Failing that, whatever follower in the camp has the highest "prowess". </p>
<figure>
<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/crusader-kings-3-landless-adventurers.jpg?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">
 </a>
<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Paradox Interactive</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>"Adventurers don’t really experience succession politics in the same way that even the smallest realm does," the developer explains. "There are no laws binding them save their own will, and comparatively little to be divided or fought over anyway..." </p>
<p>The post goes deeper into the mechanics and says more details will be covered in a later dev diary. Considering the length of this post alone, I'm excitedly afraid of what constitutes the "individual nuts and bolts" yet to be discussed. But that's Crusader Kings' simulation for you. Why be merely complex, when you can be a ferociously intricate labyrinth of tiny cogs?</p>
<p>All in all, it's getting me excited for CKIII in a way I haven't been for a while. And it's not even the flagship feature of the Roads To Power DLC (that's all the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/crusader-kings-3-is-getting-two-new-expansions-in-2024">Byzantine stuff</a>). Adventurers previously existed in CKII, but mostly as pesky randos who would show up in your country with an army and a shit-eating grin. Here, players will actually be let loose into the chaos of CKIII's fully simulated nonsense, without any of the trappings of the nobility. I hope it'll be as disastrously good as it looks.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Developer RageSquid has unveiled Descenders Next, an extreme-sports-focused sort-of-sequel to  2018's acclaimed downhill biking hit Descenders, which is aiming to be "the only extreme sports game you'll ever need" when it comes to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2375530/Descenders_Next/">Steam</a> and Game Pass sometime in 2025.
</p>
<p>
The original Descenders was all about exhilarating mountain biking across a procedurally generated world. Descenders Next, though, is doing something a little bit different, expanding its scope to include as many extreme sports as it possibly can over the coming years.
</p>
<p>
As per its reveal announcement, RageSquid's goal with Descenders Next is to capture the "same feel, the same sense speed" as its predecessor, but across numerous disciplines, beginning with boarding sports on release.

<p>
"Players will learn to conquer the snowy caps through tight, effortless snowboarding action," the studio explains, "before taking to the highlands with the grittier feel of mountainboarding. Each sport will feel and handle completely different to the others, meaning players will have to learn to tackle and master every nook and cranny of Next."
</p>
<p>
All this plays out across procedural off-piste mountains chaining into "tight, winding parks and vistas", where players can attempt speed challenges, trick-focused challenges, even scavenger hunts. There's talk of "multiple huge biomes", as well as full multiplayer support, and players can earn rep used to buy new boards, kits, helmets, goggles, and more as they play. RageSquid even promises a "banging" soundtrack form Monstercat.
</p>
<p>
Ahead of Descenders Next's release in 2025, RageSquid will be running a number of online Test Sessions later this year, and interested parties can sign up via the game's website.

These games didn’t concern themselves with Italian plumbers or sad surrogate dads, but with fierce warriors who shirtlessly strode into battle, their muscles on glorious display, to cut down their foes with swords and prove themselves the strongest and manliest of all. I speak, of course, of barbarians. And though, in recent decades, games focused entirely on the heroic exploits of barbarians have been few and far between, we now find ourselves in the midst of a mini-renaissance of barbarian games!

Then, of course, there’s <em>Barbarian </em>for the Amiga, a fighting game that made a friend and I laugh endlessly <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://youtu.be/C4Ii_YfJNvw?si=ayzcLHjJVSuivLFu&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://youtu.be/C4Ii_YfJNvw?si=ayzcLHjJVSuivLFu" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">as we cut each other’s heads off again and again</a></span>. (Here in the U.S. this one was called <em>Death Sword </em>but it will always be <em>Barbarian </em>to me.) If I list every barbarian game of the era, I’ll be here all day, but other notable ones include <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EoI9NH5GlQw&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EoI9NH5GlQw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Sword of Sodan</em></a></span><em> </em>(avoid the Genesis version at all costs) and perhaps the most legendary of them all, <em>Rastan</em>, Taito’s tough-as-nails 1987 arcade game with a pulse-pounding soundtrack and a barbarian hero to rival the likes of Conan himself. Behold it here in all its glory.<br></p><p><br>In addition to being arguably the most famous barbarian game of the 1980s, <em>Rastan </em>is also the one whose influence on the two brand-new barbarian games that are giving the genre a mini-renaissance is most clear. First of all, there’s <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.jandusoft.com/abathor/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.jandusoft.com/abathor/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Abathor</em></a></span>, a side-scrolling action game available on every current platform. <em>Abathor </em>lets you and up to three friends embark on an epic hack-and-slash quest across dozens of stages, and while at first things may feel a bit easy and ordinary, rest assured that as you progress, the intensity ratchets up mightily. Thus far I’ve made it to the game’s fourth zone, and I’m really impressed by how it’s now starting to throw constant surprises at me, all manner of new perils and new situations that are keeping me on my toes. If anything, I’d urge you NOT to watch the trailer below, because I think it’s better to discover what the game has to offer yourself. However, if you want a peek at the game’s gorgeous pixel art and old-school gameplay, look no further. <em>Abathor </em>is definitely a worthy successor to the barbarian games of old.<br></p><p>And then there’s <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.digitaleclipse.com/games/volgarr2&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.digitaleclipse.com/games/volgarr2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Volgarr the Viking II</em></a></span>. Now look, <em>Abathor </em>ain’t exactly a walk in the park, but <em>Volgarr II</em>, like its 2013 predecessor, leans into the difficulty of the 1980s games that inspired it—<em>hard</em>. Volgarr may be a muscular viking warrior but he still dies in one hit by default, and playing it, you <em>will </em>die, <em>a lot. </em>This is the kind of game that demands that you study, memorize, and master it, remembering where enemies spawn and how they behave so that you know how to tackle them and ultimately emerge from the level triumphant. Maybe that sounds like a chore to you, but let me tell you, my time with <em>Volgarr II </em>has reminded me just how immensely rewarding games with this kind of difficulty can be.<br></p><p>I can see myself in real-time figuring out how to navigate the challenges it puts before me, and developing that kind of mastery is immensely satisfying. Also, if you played the original ten years ago and decided it wasn’t for you, don’t write off this sequel just yet. In every way that counts, it’s just as challenging as its predecessor, but it also gives you a few more tools that just might give you the encouragement and support you need to succeed—things like mid-level checkpoints and one helpful feature I refuse to spoil, it’s so twisted and inventive. I still have a long way to go in <em>Volgarr II</em>, but I know it offers the kind of satisfaction I’ve rarely experienced from a game since the likes of <em>Ninja Gaiden </em>and <em>Super Ghouls ‘n Ghosts </em>were commonplace. Like <em>Abathor</em>, you can now find <em>Volgarr II </em>on pretty much every platform that still gets new video games.<br></p><p>Okay, so two games may not seem like a lot, but for a subgenre that has seen so little activity in so long—specifically tough, side-scrolling hack-and-slash action games about barbarians—two great entries landing at right around the same time feels like a veritable feast of riches. For people like me who’ve been longing for a return to the glory days of <em>Rastan</em>, feast well, my friends. Valhalla awaits. <br></p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/there%E2%80%99s-no-good-reason-to-buy-a-yeti-mic.945858/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/dont-buy-a-yeti-mic-please-logitech<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Podcasters have it so good today. Back in the day, you had basically one choice for “what kind of mic should I use?” if you were a normal person, and that was the Blue Yeti mic. You may have one of these in your home. It served people decently, but we have moved on as a society. Yet I still see Blue Yetis being sold in 2024, the brand having been folded into Logitech. I have had to deal with these things for years and years, and have developed a list of things I hate about them.&nbsp;</p><h4>1. I hate its awful little USB port</h4><figure><figcaption>This is taken directly from an iFixit guide for the Yeti, which you may need if this awful little USB port breaks. Credit: <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/Guide/Blue+Yeti+Disassembly/111262" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kevin Jones/iFixit</a></figcaption></figure><p>I never want to see a Mini or Micro USB port or cable for the rest of my life. After a long and tumultuous era, we have settled on which USB plugs and ports suck the least, and they’re Standard-A, Type-C, and occasionally the chunky big Standard-B ones if you have a printer or something. The port on the bottom of the Blue Yeti is a very bad Mini B port. Due to the position of the mic and the generally poor quality control of the device, that thing will constantly break or just slowly get shitty over time. If you work in media, this means you have two or three broken Blue Yetis in a box in a closet next to several old capture boxes that suffered a similar fate.&nbsp;</p><p>I know Blue Yetis are still like this because my coworker Riley bought one fairly recently without asking me, brought it home, and the port on it instantly died. This made me so upset that I needed to write a manifesto about this fucking microphone.</p><h4>2.&nbsp; I hate the three little capsules inside it, the different pickup patterns, and how it is designed</h4><figure><figcaption>Instead of 3 very cheap capsules, they should have put one good one in there. Credit: Logitech</figcaption></figure><p>One of the ways that the Blue Yeti was novel when it came out is that it has multiple capsules in it. This allows you to switch the pickup pattern (the direction the microphone is sensitive) in four different ways: omnidirectional, cardioid, bidirectional and stereo. This is a feature that <a href="https://www.akg.com/microphones/condenser-microphones/C414XLS.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">exists in better mics</a>, and while those were theoretically useful if you have multiple people talking in the same room, practically speaking cardioid (so called because it’s a heart shape) is the only one you want to use because you should not be using one Blue Yeti for multiple people unless you want your podcast producer to be mad at you. Those three internal modules are <a href="https://youtu.be/EqzE3QOJwBw?si=GQbwbF3vSqutvTr3&amp;t=234" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">not well placed directionally</a>, and instead of focusing on three mediocre capsules, they could have put one pretty good one in there.</p><figure><figcaption>I have had to send this illustration that Blue made to multiple people over the years. Credit: Logitech</figcaption></figure><p>The real problem with the Blue Yeti is who it was for, and how the weird design backfires on its intended audience. This is particularly painful if you have to clean up after the results. The Yeti is a mic that your coworker or someone who is not tech-savvy would use in case they had to be on a voice call or record a podcast from home. They Google “best USB mic,” buy it, and use it without looking at the instructions. Oftentimes they select the wrong pickup pattern, speak into the wrong side, or don’t realize that it’s a front firing mic instead of a top-firing one. This is a very common mistake to make given the general shape of the mic.</p><p>If you’re an audio producer or in video production, you get the files they recorded in Audacity and it sounds like the user is in a different room. It would be clear that the well-meaning user set it up incorrectly, and you would be tasked with “fixing it,” to which you would reply that “that’s not how audio works, but I’ll see what I can do.” What’s more, most people would not use a mic arm or mic stand and simply stick with the big heavy default one, but realistically that means the speaker would often be hunched over or way too far away. This also leads to the aforementioned cable flexing, which can cause the USB port to deteriorate.&nbsp;</p><p>If used correctly, you can get somewhat passable audio from the Blue Yeti compared to internal laptop mics, but it’s a mic whose primary audience is novices who do not know how to use a mic correctly. The weird, additional points of failure would ultimately lead to many very bad sounding podcasts and broken hardware from people trying their best, and lead to the frustration of many audio professionals trying to salvage their <em>Buffy</em> recap podcast.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="2021 Yule Log, the Blue Yeti" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UdETO7u-y7k?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><figcaption>If you would like to see a Blue Yeti slowly being roasted over a fire, here you go.</figcaption></figure></div><h4>3. There are better mics, and mic/interface combos, for the same price</h4><figure><figcaption>The money spent on a Yeti mic could be spent on so many other, better options. Credit: Røde, Shure, Zoom, Motu</figcaption></figure><p>For years people would go into a store or to The Wirecutter, see the Blue Yeti, and think “Well that’s the one that people recommended, so it must be good!” Times have changed, and mics have gotten way better. Though the former top pick of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/reviews/the-best-usb-microphone/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Wirecutter</a>, they no longer will recommend it and accurately describe it for what it is: middling. <a href="https://www.techgearlab.com/topics/audio/best-usb-microphone" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tech Gear Lab</a>, <a href="https://www.tomsguide.com/best-picks/best-usb-microphones" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tom’s Guide</a> and <a href="https://www.wired.com/gallery/best-usb-microphones/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wired </a>still recommend the Yeti, which is probably the most I have ever disagreed with any of those websites. Better mics exist now at that price point ($129.99 but often on sale for $99). You can also spend a bit more or get a used mic on eBay from someone who used to have a podcast but whose dreams are now broken.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="MOTU M2 USB-C Audio Interface - REVIEW and Measurements!" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/D3ednXYd1pA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><figcaption>The Motu came out 4 years ago and it's still great. It just works. </figcaption></figure></div><p>The <a href="https://www.google.com/search?client=firefox-b-1-d&amp;q=rode+podmic" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Røde’s PodMic</a> is fantastic in both its XLR and USB variants, although the USB version is not at the same price point. Audio Technica has some USB mics that, while not the best, are far better in any head-on comparison. The <a href="https://www.elgato.com/us/en/p/wave-3-black" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Elgato Wave:3</a> wowed our now <a href="https://kotaku.com/elgato-s-making-damn-fine-streaming-mics-now-1844082525" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">passed coworker Mike Fahey</a>, particularly for its intuitive Wave Link software. On top of that, the money you spend on a bad USB mic that could easily break can be better spent on a good audio interface and a cheap but durable dynamic mic. If you wanna get serious (which some people might not!), an interface offers more flexibility and better sound.</p><p>If you are digging into interfaces, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@JulianKrause" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Julian Krause</a> is hands-down the best reviewer on YouTube for up-to-date reviews. Personally I loved the <a href="https://motu.com/en-us/products/m-series/m2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Motu M2</a> when I used it. It has a beautiful screen, a solid body, a loopback, killer latency, beautiful sounding preamps, and <em>it just works</em>. I have heard that the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JXc-EIL9RXI" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">4th generation Focusrite interfaces</a> have gotten much better than their predecessors, which is good because I severely disliked the Gen 1 and 2 Focusrites, which I found to be buggy with weak preamps that would require additional hardware (the common recommendation for ages was “get a Focusrite and a <a href="https://www.cloudmicrophones.com/cloudlifter-cl-1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cloudlifter</a>,” which I never agreed with). <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hT-x3A8Wfg8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Zoom’s AMS interfaces</a> are perfectly fine, teensy and about $80 bucks for the solo if you need something small and aren’t picky about preamp noise. In fact, the audible difference between a lot of interfaces is getting smaller and smaller, and you can do well with some <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grRdtypSOC8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fairly cheap ones</a>, even ones that cost $50.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="HOW TO choose an Audio Interface – The Ultimate Guide" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/O_L86wNbzi0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><figcaption>A good overview of the pros and cons of various Audio Interfaces. If you just want a USB mic that works, just get one of those instead!</figcaption></figure></div><p>In addition to USB mics, there are also countless cheap <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dM5AgwWimEE" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">dynamic </a>microphones like the Shure <a href="https://x.com/angelbbgrrl420/status/1815243745253867539" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">SM57s</a> and SM58s in circulation (to say nothing of clones). Those two have been around since the 1960s. You have definitely seen one on stage, and they will probably still work after being run over by a big rig. A lot of streamers get very fancy with dynamic mics (the SM7B and Electrovoice RE20 are gold standards, but I am partial to the Heil PR-40), but most people won’t have to go over $99 with an interface. Beyond a certain point with audio, it’s diminishing returns for most people.</p><p>Though I’m partial to dynamic mics for their proximity, condensers have their place for people who want to turn their home into a full audio studio. There are tons of them and they can get increasingly absurd in price, although there is also a very robust community of <a href="https://groupdiy.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">people who make DIY mic clones</a> for a fraction of the price, going so far as to source and even make reproductions of Neumann <a href="https://store.arienneaudio.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">microphone capsules themselves</a>. On top of that, I have also heard some people on <a href="https://groupdiy.com/threads/c414-body.83519/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">forums</a> as well as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hT-x3A8Wfg8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">multiple</a> Y<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AzhGoFEMvxo" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">outubers</a> rave about the $50-$75 <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QTVKpKg2EvI" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bai Fei Lei C414/Proar C414</a> condenser mic. It is visually a clone of the AKG C414, but a very different mic. I have ordered one from Alibaba to try it out, but I can’t personally attest to its quality or recommend it...yet.</p><h4>4.

The creator of the Blueberry would go on to work with a company called <a href="http://www.violet-design.com/products" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Violet</a>, and then form a company called <a href="https://usashop.jzmic.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">JZ Microphones</a> that still makes mics in Latvia to this day. I have not tried them because they retail for at least a thousand dollars, but Gearspace users and <a href="https://www.soundonsound.com/reviews/jz-black-hole" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sound On Sound</a> seem fond of them.</p><figure><figcaption>The spirit of  Baltic Latvian Universal Electronics lives on. Credit: <a href="https://usashop.jzmic.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">JZ Microphones</a></figcaption></figure><p>After years of being a well-respected microphone company, <a href="https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2009-jul-21-fi-blue-microphones21-story.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Blue would strike it big</a> with the comically cheap Snowball and the Yeti. They would create several variants of the Yeti (Yeti Pro,Yeti X, Yeti Nano). Of them, the Pro with its durable XLR input was the most defensible, but at that point you might as well just get a better microphone.&nbsp;</p><p>At this point “Blue” doesn’t exist; it’s a part of Logitech, a company whose general philosophy and choices I just don’t like. From adding an <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/17/24132468/logitech-ai-prompt-builder-button" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">AI button</a> to their mice, to idly speculating about a subscription based “<a href="https://www.theverge.com/24206847/logitech-ceo-hanneke-faber-mouse-keyboard-gaming-decoder-podcast-interview" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Forever Mouse</a>,” Logitech represents a garish and weirdly proprietary strain of hardware I’ve come to despise. Say what you will about the Yeti, a mic that I hate but will begrudgingly admit was an important milestone in home audio, but it didn’t look like LED streamer slop. Look at how they massacred my boy:</p><figure><figcaption>This does not sit well with my soul. Credit: Logitech</figcaption></figure><p>To Logitech’s credit, the Yeti GX does attempt to solve many of the issues I had with its predecessor. It looks taller, has a single supercardioid Dynamic capsule, is top-firing and has USB-C now. Those changes are too little, too late, and based on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6i5Bzp5NhSM" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Podcastage’s review</a> of it I am not a fan of how it sounds. But even if the newer Yeti was a great mic, I would not recommend paying $149.99 for something that looks like that. Blue is dead, there is an ocean of better interfaces and mics to choose from, and most of them won’t <a href="https://youtu.be/EqzE3QOJwBw?si=97GPST2-jfLgyznY&amp;t=936" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">break the second you take them out of the package</a>.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/descenders-next-2025-pc<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Publisher No More Robots and developer RageSquid have announced&nbsp;<em>Descenders Next</em>, a followup to 2019's&nbsp;<em>Descenders&nbsp;</em>that's aiming to be "the only extreme sports game you'll ever need".</p>
<p>Set to launch in 2025 on PC and as a day-one Game Pass release,&nbsp;<em>Descenders Next&nbsp;</em>won't just revolve around mountain biking like <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/descenders">its predecessor</a>. Instead, it'll start with "a couple of deeply-crafted sports", with the developers adding more sports for as long as players stick around.</p>
<p>Initially, the focus in&nbsp;<em>Descenders Next&nbsp;</em>will be on boarding sports, so you'll be able to indulge in some snowboarding and mountainboarding action. RageSquid and No More Robots say both sports will handle "completely different[ly]", too.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/descenders-next-pc-game-pass-2025-snowboarding.jpg?itok=rTnR0Ufl 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/descenders-next-pc-game-pass-2025-snowboarding.jpg?itok=l0-oYLe0 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Descenders Next&nbsp;</em>is aiming high with a new mix of sports.</figcaption></figure><p>The two studios are promising that&nbsp;<em>Descenders Next&nbsp;</em>will be "as meaty as&nbsp;<em>Descenders</em>" at launch; it'll feature online multiplayer, "tons of tricks and grinds", and "multiple huge biomes".</p>
<p>It's not clear whether or not the game will pursue the same mixture of procedural and hand-crafted content that the first game featured.</p>
<p>In a press release, No More Robots and RageSquid say&nbsp;<em>Next&nbsp;</em>will offer "a more natural experience" which will feature "procedural off-piste mountains" transitioning into "tight, winding parks and vistas". It sounds to me like there won't be much in the way of hand-crafted areas to explore, but we'll have to see.</p>
<p>You can check out the debut trailer for&nbsp;<em>Descenders Next&nbsp;</em>to see if it'll be your extreme cup of tea right here.</p>

<p>Not only will&nbsp;<em>Descenders Next&nbsp;</em>feature plenty of biomes to explore, but it'll also offer a range of objectives to complete, including races, trick challenges, and "scavenger hunts".</p>
<p>Electronic music label Monstercat, which has handled soundtracks for games like&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a>&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/beat-saber"><em>Beat Saber</em></a>, will provide the soundtrack, and No More Robots and RageSquid describe&nbsp;<em>Descenders Next</em>'s music as "absolutely banging".</p>
<p>You'll be able to check out&nbsp;<em>Descenders Next&nbsp;</em>when it launches on Steam and PC Game Pass sometime next year. Stay tuned for more info.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/new-disney-dreamlight-valley-roadmap-2024<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Gameloft has revealed a brand new&nbsp;<em>Disney Dreamlight Valley&nbsp;</em>roadmap for the remainder of 2024, and it's promising iconic characters from big Disney properties, plus new updates and more.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://disneydreamlightvalley.com/news/ValleyVignette" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a post on the game's official website</a> titled "Valley Vignette: What's Next for&nbsp;<em>Disney Dreamlight Valley</em>", Gameloft breaks down what's coming to the cozy life sim between now and the end of 2024.</p>
<p>First up, later this month,&nbsp;<em>The Princess and the Frog</em>'s Tiana comes to the Valley, bringing "culinary delights" with her. This month also marks the arrival of a new paid expansion pack for&nbsp;<em>Disney Dreamlight Valley</em>, and it's themed around stopping Jafar from carrying out his evil schemes.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/disney-dreamlight-valley-roadmap-2024-full.jpg?itok=scTXcf7m 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/disney-dreamlight-valley-roadmap-2024-full.jpg?itok=VGG0p42N 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Disney Dreamlight Valley&nbsp;</em>is getting lots of new stuff between now and the end of the year.</figcaption></figure><p>In October, a new update will arrive that brings some important quality-of-life updates, but it'll also introduce the chance to work alongside&nbsp;<em>The Lion King</em>'s Timon and Pumbaa to stop an "invasion of Night Mites".</p>
<p>Then, later in 2024, Gameloft will be airing a new Showcase, where you'll learn more about what's coming to&nbsp;<em>Disney Dreamlight Valley&nbsp;</em>for the rest of 2024, as well as what's happening throughout 2025.</p>
<p>One of the things that's being teased for the remainder of this year appears to be a&nbsp;<em>Nightmare Before Christmas&nbsp;</em>crossover; in the preview for "late 2024", the roadmap invites you to "stitch a new mystery together", and Sally's dress from the aforementioned movie can clearly be seen.</p>
<p>In the next year or so, Gameloft also says it'll be dedicating some time to improving some of&nbsp;<em>Disney Dreamlight Valley</em>'s features, including Photo Mode, decoration, wardrobe organization, and more. The game's next update will also add PlayStation crossplay at last.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/disney-dreamlight-valley-roadmap-2024-ariel.jpg?itok=agK6gEZq 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/disney-dreamlight-valley-roadmap-2024-ariel.jpg?itok=0nv2ZZlA 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Expect lots more fun Disney characters to make an appearance in&nbsp;<em>Disney Dreamlight Valley&nbsp;</em>over the next year or so.</figcaption></figure><p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Disney Dreamlight Valley</em>, it's a cozy life sim that invites you to start a new life in the titular Valley, getting to know a raft of Disney characters and making friends with them as you do so.</p>
<p>Since the game launched back in 2022 (although its <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/disney-dreamlight-valley-10-release-date">1.0 release technically arrived last year</a>), new Disney characters from properties like&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/disney-dreamlight-valley-laugh-floor-update"><em>Monsters, Inc.</em></a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/disney-dreamlight-valley-april-update-brings-simba-nala-and-much-more"><em>The Lion King</em></a>, and many more have been added, and plenty of new activities and quality-of-life improvements have been introduced as well.</p>
<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Disney Dreamlight Valley&nbsp;</em>right now across <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1401590/Disney_Dreamlight_Valley/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/disney-dreamlight-valley/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-us/games/store/disney-dreamlight-valley/9nsf0bgh8d86" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Xbox</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/disney-dreamlight-valley-switch/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch</a>.

            <p>
There's now a release date for A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead, the upcoming video game tie-in to the Emily Blunt-starring post-apocalyptic horror movie franchise. 
</p>
<p>
The Road Ahead, which looks to tell its own original story within the world of the franchise's three films (and counting), will launch for PC via Steam, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S on 17th October. 
</p>
<p>
Fans of the film series will recognise its creepy alien antagonists are back, and fans of the excellent Alien Isolation have already been comparing The Road Ahead's gameplay favourably with that survival horror classic.

A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead was first announced back in 2021 as being in development at Stormind Games, the studio behind Remothered: Tormented Fathers. 
</p>
<p>It was then properly <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-quiet-place-the-road-ahead-revealed-for-pc-and-consoles">revealed by publisher Saber Interactive back in June this year</a> with a new trailer.</p>
<p>
You play as Alex, an asthmatic college student trying to survive the end of the world with her boyfriend Martin, who must not to make any noise lest she alert any extra-terrestrial horrors. But aliens aren't the only problem - there's plenty of other threats to deal with in the ruins of civilisation - how very 2024.
</p>
<p>
One to keep a (quiet) eye on as the nights begin to draw in...

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/fall-guys-makes-its-way-into-fortnite-with-fall-guys-islands/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Fall Guys has an <a href="https://wccftech.com/summer-road-trip-fortnite-rocket-league/">official collaboration</a> with Fortnite that has been released today. In this collaboration, players can participate in brand-new maps called Fall Guys Islands. There are six Fall Guys Islands in total, <a href="https://www.fortnite.com/news/fall-guys-dives-into-fortnite" target="_blank" rel="noopener">all hand crafted by Mediatonic</a>. Three of these maps were also created in cooperation with Studio 568 and Spiral House.</p>
<p>Players can explore these colorful maps via the "Fall Guys" row in Discover. These maps include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Falling Up</li>
<li>Tumble Towers</li>
<li>Blunderdrome Blast</li>
<li>Hex-a-Gone Unlimited</li>
<li>Bean Circuit</li>
<li>Pegwin Pickup</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to these curated maps, Fortnite Creators can also make their own Fall Guys Islands if they wish. The tools needed for these maps went live on July 23 in UEFN and Creative. There is also the potential for any of the maps made with the Fall Guys template to qualify for a place on the Fall Guys row in the Discover section.</p>
<p>In addition to Fall Guys Islands, there is a massive obstacle course coming to Fortnite. This obstacle course is called "Where We Fallin'" and will be available for players to participate in from now through August 15. The aim is to track down one of the several Bean Idols that are hidden throughout the Classy Courts. Once you interact with one, you'll transform into a Fall Guys bean and be able to participate in the obstacle course in the sky.</p>
<p>There are also "Where We Fallin'" quests that players can participate in to earn rewards. Per Battle Royale match, players have three attempts to set a time, but can only complete the obstacle course once per match. If you manage to complete the obstacle course in or under 120 seconds, you'll get your hands on some loot for the rest of the match.</p>
<p>If you've been playing Fortnite and wished you could see yourself as a Fall Guys bean, this collab will allow you to do just that. Your outfit will morph into a Fall Guys bean during the obstacle course, in the Lobby and Locker if you have a Fall Guys Island selected, as well as when you are roaming the Fall Guys Islands.</p>
<p>Depending on what outfit you have equipped will alter how your Fall Guys bean will look. Once you've completed the obstacle island or you are no longer on a Fall Guys Island, your outfit will revert back to normal. For those who are using outfits that don't belong to a default Fortnite character, your bean appearance will automatically transform into the default bean from Fall Guys.</p>

It is notable primarily because of its massive excavator jutting out of the hilltop. But once you stumble close enough, you’ll find it’s one of the game’s largest Blood Eagle camps.</p><p>You will face several raiders here, most well-equipped, with a few who foolishly rush you headlong in an attempt to score a melee takedown. Stomp them into the ground! But watch out for the Blood Eagles with a height advantage, as a few like to camp atop the excavator and fire down upon you.</p><p>Once you clear the location, head up to the top of the excavator. There, you’ll find a missile launcher, ammunition, and grenades.

It’s a personal favorite location to farm as, once the enemies have been forcefully removed, there’s usually a lot of loot to sort through. You’ll likely find Raider Power Armor, fusion cores, mini-nukes, Nuka-Cola Cranberry, armor mods, cooking recipes, and the usual crafting materials!</p><p>The Sludge Works appears to have a confusing layout, but it’s simple enough to clear each outbuilding inside the walls and work your way up the defenses. However, be mindful of the toxic lake in the center of the POI. On the deck jutting out into the sludge, there’s usually a raider wearing Power Armor to contend with!</p><hr><h2 id="h119626"><a id="honor"></a>Honorable mentions</h2><figure id="" data-id="e01fce7b75073baff50eb51f403cddf1" data-recommend-id="image://e01fce7b75073baff50eb51f403cddf1" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A Blood Eagle NPC races toward the player while wielding a shotgun." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A Blood Eagle NPC races toward the player while wielding a shotgun." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Bethesda / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="e01fce7b75073baff50eb51f403cddf1" data-recommend-id="image://e01fce7b75073baff50eb51f403cddf1" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A Blood Eagle NPC races toward the player while wielding a shotgun." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>If you’ve run out of Blood Eagles at the locations mentioned above, here are a few more common spawns you can find around the map:</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>The Pigsty</li><li>High Knob Lookout</li><li>Summersville</li><li>Watoga Underground</li><li>Big Bend Tunnel</li><li>Dagger’s Den</li><li>The Kill Box</li></ul><p>These locations feature a rather wide assortment of loot, with most pulling from the random loot table to fill shelves and containers.

    <p><span>Due out first for Xbox and PC in 2025.</span>
      </p></div><div><p>Publisher <a title="Companies > No More Robots [19 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/no-more-robots">No More Robots</a> and developer <a title="Companies > RageSquid" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/ragesquid">RageSquid</a> have announced <em><a title="Games > Descenders Next" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/descenders-next">Descenders Next</a></em>, a multiple extreme sports follow-up to the downhill biking game <em>Descenders</em>. It will launch first for <a title="Platforms > Xbox Series [5,775 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/xbox/xbox-series">Xbox Series</a>, <a title="Platforms > Xbox One [13,365 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/xbox/xbox-one">Xbox One</a>, and <a title="Platforms > PC [20,804 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2375530/Descenders_Next/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam</a> and Microsoft Store in 2025, as well as via <a title="Platforms > Xbox [24,483 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/xbox">Xbox</a> Game Pass, followed by <a title="Platforms > PS5 [7,587 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps5">PlayStation 5</a> and <a title="Platforms > PS4 [27,013 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps4">PlayStation 4</a> at a later date. A representative for No More Robots told <a title="Companies > Gematsu" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/gematsu">Gematsu</a> that while a Switch version is doubtful, it will likely appear on Nintendo’s next console. <span id="more-903732"></span></p><p>Here is an overview of the game, via No More Robots:</p><blockquote><p><em>Descenders Next</em> is the long-anticipated follow-up to downhill biking hit <em>Descenders</em>.</p><p><em>Descenders Next</em> will aim to become the only extreme <a title="Genres > Sports [562 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/sports">sports game</a> you’ll ever need, starting life with a couple of deeply-crafted sports, and slowly but surely adding more and more adrenaline-fueled activities over time.</p><p>Building on the success of <em>Descenders</em>—which has seen 30 million players since it launched six years ago—<em>Descenders Next</em> is the natural evolution of the original experience. We asked ourselves: Where do we go from <em>Descenders</em>? How do we deliver the same feel, the same sense of speed, but expand beyond mountain biking? From there, the idea of perfecting the fluidity of numerous sports was born.</p><p>When <em>Descenders Next</em> launches in 2025, it will begin life with a focus on boarding sports. Players will learn to conquer the snowy caps through tight, effortless snowboarding <a title="Genres > Action [2,051 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/action">action</a>, before taking to the highlands with the grittier feel of mountainboarding. Each sport will feel and handle completely different to the others, meaning players will have to learn to tackle and master every nook and cranny of <em>Next</em>.</p></blockquote><!-- AD: content -->
        <div id="carousel_903736"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><blockquote><p><em>Descenders Next</em> will already be as meaty as <em>Descenders</em> when it launches, with full online <a title="Genres > Multiplayer [356 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/multiplayer">multiplayer</a> action, tons of tricks and grinds to pull off, and multiple huge biomes to explore. Players will earn rep as they scale the mountain, and use that to buy new boards, kits, helmets, goggles, and more to customize their rider.</p><p>Last time around, <em>Descenders</em> provided both procedurally-generated tracks, as well as a selection of hand-crafted parks. With Descenders Next we’ve brought it all together with a more natural experience, as players will tackle procedural off-piste mountains that chain together into tight, winding parks, and vistas.</p><p>The parks in particular will provide fresh new challenges, while also acting as Next’s playgrounds of fun. Sometimes you’ll be required to dash down the mountain with your friends as quickly as possible, while other times you’ll be aiming to focus on your tricks and perfect landings. Scavenger hunts will see players exploring every inch of the mountain, and unlocking special rewards for those who venture the deepest.</p><p>Top it all off with an absolutely banging soundtrack from Monstercat, and you’ve got even more reasons to spend hours on the slopes, chilling out to the latest in drum and bass hits.</p></blockquote><p>Watch the announcement trailer below.
