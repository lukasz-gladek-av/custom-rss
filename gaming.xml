<p>Risk it all in August</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>WayForward has given us a Switch release date for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/shantae_advance_risky_revolution">Shantae Advance: Risky Revolution</a>, the once-cancelled GBA sequel to the original <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gbc/shantae">Shantae</a> game.</p>
<p>Coming to Switch on <strong>19th August 2025</strong> — a few months after some fans got hold of a GBA cartridge with the game on it from Limited Run Games — Shantae Advance: Risky Revolution is also getting a Deluxe Edition, which comes with three extra costumes for the genie to dress up in.</p>
<p>These three exclusive costumes are the Relic Hunter, High Voltage, and Sizzle Armor, each giving Shantae unique powers. If you're getting the physical version of the game, the Deluxe Edition is already included on the cartridge. Pre-orders go live on 8th August 2025 at <a href="https://limitedrungames.com/collections/all-games/products/shantae-advance-risky-revolution-standard-edition-switch-ps5-ps4-xbox-pc?_pos=5&amp;_sid=1f19ab402&amp;_ss=r">Limited Run Games</a>, where the game costs $34.99.</p>

<p>Let's get a quick rundown of the game from developer WayForward, then:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Shantae is back in an adventure 20 years in the making! The nefarious pirate Risky Boots has a “groundbreaking” new plan that will leave Sequin Land spinning — by rotating the continent, she can move any town right to the coast for easy plundering! As Shantae, turn the tectonic tables on Risky by taking control of the land itself: shift, twist, navigate, and explore by swapping between mix-and-match multilayered levels! Hair-whip and belly-dance your way through scrambled lands, misplaced towns, monster-filled crypts, and daunting labyrinths. Six creature transformations, fierce boss battles, and a 4-player versus mode await!</p>
<p><strong>Key Features:<br>
-</strong> Discover the lost chapter of the Shantae saga, fully restored and released after 20 years!<br>
<strong>-</strong> Fight and explore using your hair-whipping ability, magic items, and belly-dance transformations (including monkey, elephant, crab, and more)!<br>
<strong>-</strong> Spin and shift Front Yard and Back Yard playfields to create new routes and solve puzzles!<br>
<strong>-</strong> Visit towns, battle through labyrinths, purchase upgrades, find collectables, and meet with friends like Rottytops, Sky, and Bolo!<br>
<strong>-</strong> For the first time ever in a Shantae game, four players can compete in Battle Mode!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Darrington Press has released new playtest material for <em>Daggerheart</em>. The latest batch of <em>Daggerheart</em> playtest material of material doesn't introduce a new ancestry or a new class, but a new transformation mechanic, allowing players to become monstrous vampires or werewolves at the table.</p>



<p>The new <em>Daggerheart</em> playtest material was added in an update to <a href="https://www.daggerheart.com/thevoid/" rel="nofollow">The Void</a>, Darrington Press' page for new playtest material. Similar to <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons'</em> <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/latest-dungeons-dragons-2024-unearthed-arcana-revisits-arcane-subclasses" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Unearthed Arcana</a>, the page provides players with an early look at experimental gameplay mechanics and ideas.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/daggerheart-playtest-material-transformation-image.jpg?itok=Bm16HyTY 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/daggerheart-playtest-material-transformation-image.jpg?itok=22bfQkf2 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Those players can then provide feedback to Darrington Press. Based on that feedback, the material may be adjusted and released in official supplements down the line.</p>

<p>As the name suggests, the new transformation represents changes to a player's character in <em>Daggerheart</em>. These changes can be done for narrative purposes by the GM or can be used as a character creation option. The playtest material contains rules and cards for six transformations: Vampire, Werewolf, Demigod, Ghost, Reanimated, and Shapeshifter.</p>

<p>How the transformation <em>Daggerheart</em> playtest material works in-game is that your character adds the corresponding transformation card to their loadout, ignoring their domain card limit. A character can only have one transformation total. That transformation card then provides an appropriate benefit and drawback.</p>

<p>The playtest material encourages gaming tables to figure out the origin of this transformation alongside the implications of the power going wrong. For example, vampire and werewolf transformations are staples of pop culture; get bitten and be forever changed. But while a werewolf player benefits from a Wolf Form, sacrificing Stress for a damage boost, they can potentially massacre their party with the Frenzy drawback.</p>

<p>The more eclectic forms do encourage some more creativity. Reanimated and Ghost do contain potential for dark fantasy and horror adventures, and the Demigod does invite some intriguing worldbuilding and roleplay potential if done well.</p>

<p>The new transformation Daggerheart playtest material, which includes rules and the transformation cards, are free to download.</p>

          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p>With Fortnite OG existing as its own permanent mode now, we aren't expecting another throwback mini-season in the vein of last year's Chapter 2 Remix or the original OG season the year before. But with the upcoming Chapter 6 Season 4 starting on August 8, we're pretty much guaranteed a new mini-season in November, because Fortnite has never had a four-month season on purpose before. Instead, the hot rumor since the beginning of May is that we'll be getting another collaboration mini-season like Star Wars season in May, this time with <a href="https://x.com/blortzen/status/1920270562812670238" rel="nofollow ">The Simpsons taking center stage</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">When you consider Epic's cozy relationship with Disney, plus its long history of Fox Animation collabs--including three cartoon dads Fortnite dropped for Father's Day this past June--this rumor sounds pretty plausible. Indeed, there's been nearly no skepticism about it at all. November is still a long ways away, though, and a lot can happen between now and then. While we wait, let's see what exactly the rumor mill has said about this one.</p><h2 dir="ltr">When would the Simpsons mini-season start?</h2><p dir="ltr">According to <a href="https://x.com/HYPEX/status/1950226569697362395" rel="nofollow ">next season's update schedule</a>, Chapter 6 Season 4 should end on Saturday, November 1, which indicates it'll have a live finale event to wrap things up during the day. If things work the way they did after the Death Star Sabotage event in June, the new mini-season would begin that same evening after 4-7 hours of maintenance. Otherwise, it would start the next morning, on November 2.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Is the Simpsons mini-season officially confirmed?</h2><p dir="ltr">Not at all. Every bit of info about the purported Simpsons season comes from leakers and dataminers, and it has all just been written descriptions--there's been no leaked art or anything tangible that might serve as some level of confirmation. There is, however, <a href="https://x.com/HYPEX/status/1932068250143039720" rel="nofollow ">one poster in Utopia City</a> that could be hinting at a Simpsons collab, but that's not confirmation of any sort of takeover.</p><p dir="ltr">Considering the way Epic typically likes to hold back on promoting a new season until the current one is almost over, we've got a while before Epic will say anything about it at all. But prominent leakers have been harping on it so regularly that a lot of folks have taken it as read that a Simpsons season is coming. But until some real teasers start popping up, November's Simpsons mini-season remains an unconfirmed rumor.</p><h2 dir="ltr">What would a Simpsons mini-season entail?</h2><p dir="ltr">The rumors so far are vague and confusing, and so it's a little difficult to sift through it all right now. The full picture is not even remotely clear just yet. Keep that in mind as we lay out the fractured details that we currently have.</p><p dir="ltr">The most surprising detail among the rumors thus far is that the Simpsons will have an entire map modeled after the Simpsons' hometown of Springfield, but the claim is that it will be <a href="https://x.com/Loolo_WRLD/status/1931473086538531263" rel="nofollow ">the size of a Reload map and support only 40 players</a>. It's not out of the question that the main Battle Royale mode could go small for this since it only lasts a month--let's not forget that Epic made <em>everyone</em> play Zero Build for two weeks after it was introduced in early 2022. But there's also another fairly obvious possibility worth considering: that the Springfield map actually <em>will</em> be for Reload, rather than BR.</p><p dir="ltr">Considering Reload is Fortnite's clear no. 2 mode at this point, and it has no battle pass, it wouldn't be surprising if Epic looked for new ways to encourage folks to play it. Plus, it just got a Squid Game-themed map added to its rotation in June, so there's precedent. On the other hand, this part of the rumor could be completely wrong. Blortzen, the leaker who first spread the rumor about the Simpsons season, suggested in June that the rumor about a small map was <a href="https://x.com/blortzen/status/1934688153606004804" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">actually about Blitz Royale</a>, which was announced a couple weeks after all these Simpsons rumors were spread around.</p><p dir="ltr">Beyond that, everything else we've heard makes this rumored Simpsons season sounds like it will include most of the same stuff other mini-seasons have--a small battle pass, accompanying shop skins, and weekly changes to the map. But since we haven't heard any significant new details since the beginning of June, it's still hard to gauge what exactly Simpsons season will look like.</p>

This bonkers dating sim boasted a monster voice cast with portfolios spanning <strong>Final Fantasy</strong>, <strong>Persona</strong>, <strong>Fire Emblem</strong> and more, but it was let down by some heartbreaking performance issues. Fortunately, the latest Switch update — which developer Sassy Chap Games calls a "mega patch" — should clear some of that up.</p>
<p>The latest update bundles three previous hotfixes into one bug break-up package. Those bugs have clearly been the target of this one, with the "mega patch" fixing a lot of issues in the game's multiple endings, and adding an overall performance boost to the Switch version.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067yovlgt&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-open-beta-closed-beta-august/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ea-will-host-an-open-beta-for-battlefield-6-in-august-dates-revealed-%E2%80%93-rumor.1257429/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>EA will reportedly host an open beta for Battlefield 6 in August, potentially even two open betas, the first at the beginning of the month and the second one later in the month.</p>



<p>This claim comes from <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-open-beta/">Insider-Gaming</a>, which claims from its sources that access to a closed beta can be gained through a promotion with several content creators who will be giving away codes on Twitch. Insider-Gaming also claims that following the closed beta on August 7-8, the beta will continue until August 10th in an "<em>open-beta phase</em>," though that is seemingly separate from an open beta later in the month from August 14-17.</p>



<p>Shortly after Insider-Gaming's report, however, in the official Battlefield Discord server, EA's global community manager denied the claim that there was a closed beta at all, confirming that only an open beta is planned. Perhaps Insider-Gaming's wires were crossed, and there are two open betas planned. Either way, we'll likely know for sure tomorrow.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>We got our first official look at Battlefield 6 just <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-revealed/">last week</a>, with its debut trailer showing what looked more like cutscenes from various points of the game's campaign rather than gameplay. Last week's announcement also confirmed that we'll get a gameplay trailer for multiplayer tomorrow, July 31, 2025, which is likely where we'll find out if Insider-Gaming and its sources are correct about the beta dates. </p>

</p></figure>



<p>While there's definitely a lot riding on the campaign for Battlefield 6, its multiplayer is what will decide if the game lives or dies. It took EA months to undo the mistakes and damage it did to Battlefield 2042's multiplayer, which was unfortunately the only mode 2042 had since it lacked a campaign.</p>



<p>EA has a lot riding on Battlefield 6, with four of its core studios working on it and with <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-targeting-100-million-players/">hundreds of millions reportedly invested </a>into its development. We'll see how players respond to tomorrow's gameplay trailer, and if Battlefield 6 will have the legs EA is expecting it to have.</p>

        <p>Claiming otherwise is evidence of a "reasoning gap"</p>

</div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>If the messy situation regarding <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/subnautica-2">Subnautica 2</a> and those ousted studio heads has led you to wonder if publishers Krafton might be mismanaging the development of their games, the company's chief financial officer reckons you're diving in the wrong sea. According to Dongkeun Bae, Subnautica 2's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/krafton-plan-to-delay-subnautica-2-and-deny-the-studio-a-250-million-bonus">delay from 2025 release to 2026</a> is proof that Krafton are doing a good job with that, actually.</p>
<p>The exec said as much via translator during a recent earnings call that, among many other things, featured the publishers' own version of the events surrounding Striking Distance CEO Steve Papoutsis being parachuted in at Unknown Worlds to replace senior executives Charlie Cleveland, Max McGuire, and Ted Gill <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/krafton-suddenly-replace-three-subnautica-2-leads-with-one-of-the-execs-behind-callisto-protocol">last month</a>. Whether Subnautica 2 was genuinely <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/subnautica-2-is-ready-for-early-access-says-co-founder-ousted-from-studio-but-the-publishers-seem-to-disagree">ready to release in early access</a> this year is a key part of the whole fracas. Krafton say no, the three fired leads say yes, and now the latter are <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/subnautica-2-publishers-krafton-accuse-ousted-bosses-of-abandoning-duties-and-now-those-ex-leads-are-suing">suing</a>. The complicating factor is that there was a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/subnautica-2-studio-will-get-their-bonus-says-krafton-but-its-not-the-250-million-promised">big bonus for the studio's workers</a> tied to the game releasing this year.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>All of that context brings us to Krafton's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lghT4WUpgZQ">latest quarterly earnings call</a>. During the Q&amp;A section that always follows the great number-filled presentationy bit of these things, CFO Dongkeun Bae was asked by one analyst whether Krafton are struggling to manage all their different game projects, given the disagreement over Subnautica 2's readiness for early access. That analyst also questioned whether the company's "internal standard is appropriate for different games and different initiatives, Subnautica 2 milestone included".</p>
<p>"I do fully understand that from the outside you may think that because there's talk of legal proceedings of Subnautica 2 and it being delayed, that could make you think that maybe within Krafton our milestone process is being mismanaged," Bae responded, continuing as follows:</p>
<blockquote><p>There's a bit of I believe a reasoning leap or reasoning gap between those two points. I say that because the actions that we've taken on Subnautica 2 actually represent that things are effectively being managed inside Krafton when it comes to the milestone management. </p>
<p>I say that because...[the] Subnautica IP basically has this big follower base, this fandom base. So, as long as we market it and we release it into the market, people would say that there's [a] certain level of sales from this title [which] will be guaranteed. But what we are seeking to do is to make sure that we satisfy the highest level of satisfaction that the gamers have, their aspiration. And so because we've managed the whole milestone process very rigorously within the company, we were able to make the decision that we made regarding Subnautica 2 and because we felt that the game was not up to par, not up to the level that we had wished it to be.</p></blockquote>
<p>That's a fairly blunt way of saying that if they weren't managing <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/subnautica">Subnautica</a> properly, they'd have been cool essentially chucking out any old shite with the Subnautica name on it, because it'd probably make bank regardless.</p>
<p>In response to another question from the same person, Bae also talked a bit about how Krafton sees Subnautica 2 as worth approaching differently to life sim InZoi, despite both going the early access route. Basically, with the latter not being an established name and offering "a great level of freedom" that might leave players feeling a bit lost or overwhelmed, Krafton reckon getting live feedback on it ASAP is the key priority. By contrast, the publishers believe that as an established thing, Subnautica 2's facing "much higher" initial expectations from players, and will need to offer a "greater level of distinctive and differentiating fun factor". </p>
<p>So, there's a bit more of the company giving more of its view and arguably playing a bit of defense even to money types about the Subnautica 2 situation, which continues to rumble on as we wait to see what'll happen with the lawsuit brought by the former studio leads.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/subnautica-2-delay-actually-proves-krafton-arent-mismanaging-their-games-says-exec]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Prices for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-most-expensive-151-cards">Scarlet and Violet 151 Pokémon cards</a> have been moving fast this month. As more booster boxes get opened and singles flood the market, some of the set’s Illustration Rares have started to dip in value, especially the middle evolutions of the starter <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-buy-pokemon-tcg">Pokémon</a>. On the flip side, big Special Illustration Rares of fan favourite Kanto starter final evolutions are seeing steady climbs as collectors chase the best‑looking cards from the set.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Charizard ex, Blastoise ex and Venusaur ex are the top of the climbers hill this week with noticeable price jumps, while Zapdos ex and Alakazam ex are also gaining traction with collectors and competitive players. All five of these cards have strong artwork, great playability, or both, which is helping push prices higher.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The same can’t be said for some of the Illustration Rares of Charmander, Squirtle, Bulbasaur, and their evolutions. These cards spiked when the set first dropped, but with more supply on the market, prices have started to settle. They’re still popular pulls, just not commanding the same premium they did in June.</p><p id="crashers"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Crashers">Crashers</h2></p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/29/pixel-9-94-1753801366630.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Credit: The Pokémon Company</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">While the Kanto starters’ final evolutions are climbing, their earlier forms have started to dip in value as more Scarlet &amp; Violet 151 product hits the market. Charmander, Squirtle, and Bulbasaur were among the hottest Illustration Rares when the set launched, but prices are cooling as supply catches up with demand. Charmander is down 14% to $44.44, Squirtle has dropped 7% to $43.80, and Bulbasaur has fallen 18% to $32.20. These cards are still popular with collectors who want to complete the evolutionary lines, but they no longer command the inflated early prices from the set’s release month.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The middle evolutions are following the same trend. Charmeleon has dropped 14% to $30.54, while Wartortle is down 15% to $27.36. Both Illustration Rares have fantastic artwork and remain fun pulls, but they simply don’t hold the same appeal as the Special Illustration Rare ex cards of their final evolutions. As Scarlet &amp; Violet 151 booster boxes continue to be opened, the market has become saturated with these mid‑tier rares, bringing prices back down to more reasonable levels.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Even with these price drops, the Illustration Rares of the Kanto starters and their evolutions are still great pickups for collectors who want the full line. Prices are likely to stabilise at these lower points, making now a good time to grab them if you missed out early. The final evolutions will continue to be the big-ticket items, but these cards remain iconic pieces of the set for anyone who grew up with the original Pokémon games.</p><p id="climbers"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Climbers">Climbers</h2></p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/29/pixel-9-93-1753801271476.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Credit: The Pokémon Company</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Charizard ex has risen to $210.00, up 14% from early July. It remains one of the most in-demand cards in the set thanks to its powerful Explosive Vortex attack, which hits for 330 damage, and the fantastic Special Illustration Rare artwork that collectors continue to chase. Blastoise ex has seen an even sharper jump, climbing 28% to $84.99, driven by both its intimidating art and competitive appeal. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Solid Shell makes Blastoise surprisingly tanky, and Twin Cannons can unload massive damage by discarding Water Energy from your hand.Venusaur ex is seeing a similar surge, up 27% to $69.99. While Charizard usually grabs the spotlight, Venusaur’s Illustration Rare version has become a favourite for collectors who love its vibrant, personality-filled design. Its ability Tranquil Flower lets you heal 60 damage every turn while in the Active Spot, and Dangerous Toxwhip spreads status conditions alongside 150 damage, making it a tricky card to deal with in grindy matchups.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Legendary Pokémon aren’t being left out either. Zapdos ex has climbed 23% to $61.99, buoyed by a dynamic Illustration Rare that shows the Legendary Bird mid-strike. It isn’t just binder candy, though. Voltaic Float removes its retreat cost when it has Lightning Energy attached, and Multishot Lightning can deal big damage to both the Active and a damaged Benched Pokémon.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Rounding out the climbers is Alakazam ex, which has risen the fastest of the bunch, up 35% to $44.98. The surreal, psychedelic artwork on its Special Illustration Rare has kept collector interest high, but it’s also a flexible attacker. Mind Jack punishes opponents with full benches, while Dimensional Hand can be used even if Alakazam stays on the Bench, giving it options that most other attackers don’t have.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">10 Most Expensive Cards In Black Bolt and White Flare</h2><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-black-bolt-most-popular-cards">Black Bolt</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-white-flare-10-most-popular-cards">White Flare</a> are the final Scarlet and Violet expansions, released together earlier this month. Each half of the set has its own focus, with Black Bolt featuring Pokémon like Zekrom, Kyurem, and Genesect, while White Flare highlights Reshiram, Keldeo, and Hydreigon. What makes these sets unique is the new Black White Rares and the fact that every single Pokémon has at least one Illustration Rare or Special Illustration Rare.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Among the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/most-expensive-black-bolt-white-flare-pokemon-cards-right-now">most expensive cards</a> are the Black White Rare versions of Zekrom ex, Reshiram ex, and Victini, all highly desirable for both their powerful attacks and prestige foil treatments. Special Illustration Rares like Hydreigon ex, Keldeo ex, Genesect ex, and Kyurem ex are my favorites, plus they're cheaper than their Black White Rare versions.</p><p id="latest-stock-updates"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Latest Stock Updates">Pokémon TCG Price Updates</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">I can't believe I was singing <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/deals-for-today-july-22">Amazon's praises last week</a> for some <em>near </em>MSRP deals on sealed <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-release-full-release-schedule-2025">Pokémon TCG</a> product, as this week they're back up to ridiculous pricing. You should stay away until they lower their prices and stick to TCGPlayer and eBay right now, which in some cases are a clean $15 below Amazon's current pricing. The benefit of buying from TCGPlayer is the vetted sellers and full transparancy on market values, but if you can save even more on eBay then go for it. All links are above to make your life easier.</p><p id="last-weeks-update"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Last Week's Update">Last Week's Crashers and Climbers</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Scarlet and Violet base set prices have been volatile lately, with Illustration Rares seeing steady gains while some <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-biggest-pokmon-card-crashers-and-climbers-this-week-july-14">Special Illustration Rares have cooled off</a>. The Ralts evolutionary line has been one of the biggest surprises this month, with Ralts and Kirlia both climbing around 28% in value. Their popularity seems to be driven more by collectors chasing the full evolution line rather than playability alone. Gardevoir ex has also risen significantly, up to $54.99, thanks to its strong Psychic Embrace ability and frequent appearances in competitive decklists. Miraidon ex and Koraidon ex have seen smaller but consistent gains, reflecting their continued use in Lightning and Fighting decks.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">At the same time, several Illustration Rares have dropped sharply. Dondozo and Starly saw the biggest falls, down 30% and 37% respectively, likely due to their limited competitive relevance. Fidough, Armarouge, and Pachirisu also dipped, correcting from their initial launch hype. Overall, Scarlet and Violet’s market is shifting as collectors focus on full evolution lines and competitively viable cards, while once‑popular lower‑tier Illustration Rares settle into lower price ranges.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Christian Wait is a contributing freelancer for IGN covering everything collectable and deals.

                <p>Between 2021-2023, a former employee at one of game publisher Bandai Namco's subsidiaries allegedly "misappropriated" around 500 million yen (approximately $3.38 million USD), resulting in the employee's arrest and a temporary pay cut for many of the subsidiary's leadership, the company has announced.</p><p dir="ltr">While the arrest happened in January 2024 and Bandai Namco has since been pursuing civil and criminal charges against the former employee, the company is just now able to disclose the incident, according to a <a href="https://www.bandainamco.co.jp/files/HPE794A8_E_BLPHKE9968BE7A4BA.pdf" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">press release</a> outlining the alleged misconduct and the steps Bandai Namco has taken to remedy the situation.</p><p dir="ltr">The alleged embezzlement occurred at Bandai Namco's Hong Kong subsidiary Bandai Logipal and was discovered via an internal audit. Following the former employee's arrest, Bandai Logipal took disciplinary actions against many of its leadership in the form of a temporary pay deduction. Four officers and three full-time directors saw a 30% pay deduction for three months starting in April 2024, with two other full-time directors seeing a 15% pay deduction for the same period.</p><p dir="ltr">"Our group takes the occurrence of this incident very seriously and we sincerely and deeply apologize to all our stakeholders for their concerns and the inconvenience caused by such incident," Bandai Namco states. "We will continue our full cooperation with the local law enforcement authorities for the investigation, and we as a group shall work together to prevent the recurrence of such incidents."</p><p dir="ltr">In a step to prevent a similar incident in the future, the Japan-based Bandai Namco is forming a new department to supervise the management of overseas subsidiaries. It notes that the impact of the incident on Bandai Namco's fiscal year ending March 31, 2026 is expected to be minimal.</p><p dir="ltr">Sony recently announced it will be <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sony-invests-463-million-in-elden-ring-publisher-bandai-namco-as-part-of-strategic-partnership/1100-6533400/" data-ref-id="1100-6533400">investing $463 million in Bandai Namco</a> as part of a "strategic partnership" that will see it own around 2.5% of the entertainment company. While both company's are well known for video games, in a joint statement, Bandai Namco and Sony said it will "focus on expanding the fan community for IP such as anime and manga around the world and strengthening engagement, particularly in the anime field where rapid market growth is anticipated."</p>

<p dir="ltr">The Super Nintendo app already had a CRT filter, but this new version, added alongside the same update that added <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/create-your-own-mario-masterpiece-with-mario-paint-now-on-nintendo-classics-online/1100-6533518/" data-ref-id="1100-6533518">Mario Paint to the service</a>, is a noticeable improvement. According to one user on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/1mccg66/snes_classics_crt_filter_has_been_updated_on_the/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Reddit</a>, it's an "NTSC S-Video" style filter that more accurately displays what playing on an actual CRT is like.</p><p dir="ltr">Users on social media have been posting comparison screenshots between the old and new filter, and the difference is definitely noticeable. One screenshot in particular, posted by a Bluesky user named <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/smashtoons.com/post/3lv4ytp7xgc2v" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Dalton</a>, helps to highlight the difference, as you can clearly see the much more defined lines that help improve the image when compared to the old filter. You can check out some other comparisons below.</p><p dir="ltr">The new CRT filter is available for the SNES app on both the Switch and Switch 2. While the Nintendo Switch Online N64 and GameCube apps also have CRT filters, it doesn't look like they've received this new version just yet.</p><p dir="ltr">In other Nintendo news, the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-switch-2-update-has-arrived-and-stability-stans-are-going-to-be-happy/1100-6533520/" data-ref-id="1100-6533520">Switch 2 just received a new hardware update</a> that doesn't appear to do much, but does include "general system stability improvements." Nintendo announced it will host a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-direct-partner-showcase-confirmed-for-july-31/1100-6533543/" data-ref-id="1100-6533543">Nintendo Direct Partner Showcase on July 31</a>, which will include information on upcoming Nintendo Switch and Switch 2 games from third-party publishers and developers.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/genshin-impact-%E2%80%93-ineffa-build-weapons-guide.1257369/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Genshin Impact’s latest character is Ineffa, an android who is getting slightly ahead of the 6.0 versions and showing us a glimpse of what we can expect from Nod-Krai mechanically. The final patch of each version is always a big old beach episode, so filler filled with little lore nods here and there, but Ineffa is certainly bringing the hype by literally changing one of the core reactions. To get the most out of her though, you’ll need the best Ineffa build you can put together.</p>
<p><iframe title="Character Trailer - &quot;Ineffa: Essentials for Home and Travel&quot; | Genshin Impact #GenshinImpact #Ineffa" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/s-n9weZtcN0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>

<p>Ineffa changes the electro-charged reaction into lunar-charged, which is unique (for now), in that it uses every character involved in the reaction to calculate damage, and it can also crit, which electro-charged couldn’t do. While this isn’t going to be especially well-utilised with just Ineffa, we have a feeling it’ll be more relevant when we get to Nod-Krai properly with the 6.0 patch.</p>


<p>Her elemental skill summons Birgittato to deal off-field electro damage, but also gives a skill based on Ineffa’s ATK. Her burst does a big old burst of damage, and also re-summons Birgitta. If you’ve been playing for any length of time, comparing Ineffa to Fischl is the simplest way to understand things. However, most of Ineffa’s power is in one of her passives, which allows Birgitta to do additional lunar-charged damage if the effect is already in play when Birgitta attacks. With all of this in mind, Ineffa is a sub-DPS with some shielding capabilities, and she could be a nice little boost to hydro and electro teams.</p>
<h3>Genshin Impact Ineffa Best Weapon</h3>
<p>Ineffa’s signature weapon is Fractured Halo, a polearm that boosts ATK after using the elemental skill or elemental burst, and boosts lunar-charged damage if the equipping character creates a shield during that effect. However, if you’re not using this, any of the five-star weapons can do an alright job of things, but you might be better off going with a four-star weapon if you’re not using her signature.</p>

<p>Kitain Cross Spear is an excellent option because it not only gives elemental mastery and boosts elemental skill damage, but it also gives Ineffa some more energy. Ineffa does need to be able to use her burst, so this weapon ticks all of the boxes you need it to, at least for a four-star option. You can also go for the Ballad of the Fjords, or the trusty Favonius Spear, because it’s good on everyone.</p>
<h3>Genshin Impact Ineffa Best Artifacts</h3>
<p>As of Ineffa’s release, there really isn’t a great artifact set for her. We’re expecting one to come along in the 6.0 patch, but for now, you’ve got a few options that’ll do the job. The frontrunner for us is to use a set that just fits well enough for now, which is going to often just be two two-piece sets of ATK boost, like Gladiator’s Finale.</p>
<p>You can also run her with Tenacity of the Millileth if you want more shield strength and more buffs, or with Gilded Dreams for boosting her damage. For stats, you basically want an ATK sands, an ATK goblet, and a Crit circlet, most likely Crit DMG as Ineffa ascends with Crit Rate. You can go for EM if you’re interested in messing around with a hyperbloom team too.</p>

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-has-canceled-another-incubation-project-at-respawn-layoffs-reportedly-hit-the-apex-legends-star-wars-jedi-and-incubation-teams/">EA and Respawn </a>have just debuted a new gameplay trailer for the latest season for Apex Legends, which is up to its 26th season now since the free-to-play movement-focused battle royale launched in 2019. Season 26: Showdown will arrive on all platforms on August 5, 2025, bringing <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/apex-legends/apex-legends/news/showdown-game-updates">some significant changes</a> to the gameplay, including a new permanent mode, Wildcard.</p>



<p>Wildcard is a new mode that really lets players break the tried-and-true systems of Apex Legends. Gone are any cares towards tactical synergies between Legends. You can stack your whole team with the same legend if you want in Wildcard, as you zip and fly around the altered version of Kings Canyon which has been tuned with more ziplines, more launch pads, and every player gets a second chance without having to be revived, so long as you die before the final ring. </p>



<p>Looting has also been simplified and streamlined in this mode to make everything as action-packed as possible. </p>



<figure><p>

</p></figure>



<p>Other changes beyond the addition of Wildcard as a new permanent mode include the introduction of Elite weapons, the first of which is the RE-45. Two Legends, Caustic and Bangalore, are getting significant buffs this season. Amps are being introduced as new passive upgrades players can pick up in ranked and unranked matches. Hop-ups will be locked to weapons now instead of being pick-ups on the ground for players to loot. The reign of the Jumpmaster has ended, as ranked matches will now feature pre-assigned drop zones instead, and the E-District map is getting a switch to a daytime setting.</p>



<p>These are also just the highlights regarding the big changes, as the full details will be unveiled with the full patch notes that will arrive a day before Season 26 goes live, on August 4, 2025.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Much like the titular monsters who inhabit its dreaded world of darkness, <em>Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2</em>’s development has been a bit of a cursed creature. Once under the development of the team at Harsuit Labs, it was <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/vampire-masquerade-bloodlines-2-new-release-date-1850804491&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/vampire-masquerade-bloodlines-2-new-release-date-1850804491">shifted to the horror pros at The Chinese Room</a></span>, who recently released <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/sirens-rest-still-wakes-chinese-room-walking-simulator-1851785437&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/sirens-rest-still-wakes-chinese-room-walking-simulator-1851785437">an excellent follow-up DLC</a></span> to one of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/still-wakes-the-deep-review-the-chinese-room-1851544587&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/still-wakes-the-deep-review-the-chinese-room-1851544587">my favorite horror games from last year</a></span>. The Chinese Room definitely knows how to strike a tone with horror, and based on a recent dive into the game’s development with <em>Game Informer</em>, the team sounds locked in to deliver a <em>VtM</em> experience that isn’t looking to just be <em>GTA</em> with sharp, pointy teeth. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195410" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Top 10 Most-Played Games On Steam Deck: July 2023 Edition" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="169" data-playlist="195410,195922,196539" data-current="195410"><div><p>The Top 10 Most-Played Games On Steam Deck: July 2023 Edition</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195410/195410_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195410/195410_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195410/195410_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195410/195410_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/20876.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p><strong>Read More: </strong><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/sirens-rest-still-wakes-chinese-room-walking-simulator-1851785437&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/sirens-rest-still-wakes-chinese-room-walking-simulator-1851785437">This DLC Follow-Up To One Of Last Year’s Hidden Horror Gems Made Me Cry Out In Terror</a></span></p><p>“We’re not making <em>GTA</em>; this isn’t a big open world, sprawling game where the horizon is your limit,” the game’s art director, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://gameinformer.com/exclusive-interview/2025/07/29/detail-over-scope-were-not-making-gta-vampire-the-masquerade&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://gameinformer.com/exclusive-interview/2025/07/29/detail-over-scope-were-not-making-gta-vampire-the-masquerade" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ben Matthews, told <em>Game Informer</em></a></span>. Instead, the developers are aiming for density packed into a smaller region with clear boundaries, all designed to keep you focused on the central and delicate bloody balance between the “jovial, human world” and the “dark, vampire world.” </p><p>The original <em>Bloodlines</em> was a notoriously messy game. It gained cult status many moons ago as modders took to repairing its loose ends and, given that it offered such a unique experience, many fans were willing to overlook its shortcomings. Where else would you get to roleplay as a fledgling kindred trying to make it on the mean streets of Los Angeles? </p><p>There’ll be a little less freedom in who your character is in the upcoming sequel. Instead of rolling your own character, you’ll be given a choice of clans and genders for a pre-written character, Elder Phyre, a 400-year-old vamp newly awoken in Seattle. </p><p>That may be a bummer for those of us who wanted to play as a vampire of our own creation, but as <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.pcgamer.com/games/rpg/were-not-making-gta-vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-is-channeling-the-best-part-of-deus-ex-mankind-divided-a-dense-hub-instead-of-a-huge-open-world/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/rpg/were-not-making-gta-vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-is-channeling-the-best-part-of-deus-ex-mankind-divided-a-dense-hub-instead-of-a-huge-open-world/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">our comrades over at <em>PC Gamer</em></a></span> have highlighted, forgoing a massive open world in exchange for a focused, hub-like space to prowl speaks to a more intimate experience of the kind we’d expect in something like <em>Deus Ex</em>. And if there’s anything that benefits from a more intimate experience, it’s certainly <em>Vampire: The Masquerade</em>.</p><p>Having an intimate space to play in sounds like an advantageous way to leverage the very core of what makes <em>Vampire</em> <em>Vampire</em>: Needing to preserve the masquerade. The source material isn’t just about playing as bloody monsters; it’s about staying hidden, to preserve power, to protect the vulnerable. It’s a double-edged metaphor that can make for exciting choices and high-stakes situations. And were <em>Bloodlines 2</em> to be set in a massive world, it could be all too easy to get out of Dodge to avoid the deadly consequences of breaking the masquerade by feeding on humans in public or showing off your monstrous powers. </p><p>Vampires are also very restricted creatures. Sure, they live forever, but they must earn it: They have to feed, they must avoid sunlight, and it’s wise for them to ask permission before entering someone’s home. Limiting the scope of the playable space sounds like a perfect way to create the kind of contained, forced situations that lead vampires to become such dangerous cornered animals in the lore, and often at the table with dice.</p><p>The curse of Cain has clearly run through <em>Vampire</em>’s existence in video game form, all the way up to its present tumultuous development. But maybe this undead beast will grab us by the throat when it (hopefully) arrives later this year.</p><p>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/vampire-masquerade-bloodlines-2-vtm-chinese-room-1851787361]]></content:encoded>

		<p>Monomi Park has announced that the v1.0 full release of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/slime-rancher-2">Slime Rancher 2</a> is coming on 23rd September 2025, the game launching across PS5, Xbox Series X|S and PC on that date.</p>
<p>The full game will bring a big update that adds things like a new twist on Drones – something to do with Quantum – more gadgets and upgrades, new places to explore and more.</p>
<p><iframe title="Slime Rancher 2 - Release Date and Physical Pre-Order Announcement" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JHjvTdgS_p0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Beyond this, Monomi Park is partnering with iam8bit for a physical release, which will come out on 14th January 2026 for PS5 and Xbox Series X|S. Pre-ordering will net you a Slime Rancher 2 soundtrack download, a fold-out poster designed by renowned art director, Yusuke Naora, and pre-orders of the iam8bit Exclusive Edition, you can also get a sticker sheet of the wiggliest slimes and an O-Sleeve featuring Beatrix LeBeau and the rest of the Slime Rancher 2 crew. That Exclusive Edition will only be available for pre-order through 26th August.</p>
<p>The full release of Slime Rancher 2 has been a long time coming. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/06/13/slime-rancher-2-announced-and-it-is-an-xbox-console-launch-exclusive/">Originally announced in the summer of 2021</a>, the game entered into PC and Xbox early access in 2022, with a slow drip feed of updates and content in the years since then. Heck, it’s even been a full year since the early access game came to PS5 in June 2024!</p>

<p>It’s also been a long time since I checked in with the game. We have to go back to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/09/27/slime-rancher-2-early-access-review-xbox-game-pass/">my initial impressions</a>, where I said, “There’s a reason why the original Slime Rancher was so popular, and it’s clear even from the opening couple hours that Slime Rancher 2 is building on the exact same relaxed farming gameplay. The Early Access release shows a gentle evolution of the formula, giving a few morsels of what’s to come as the game grows, and we hope there’s bigger surprises down the road.”</p>

<figure><a title="NES Cartridges" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/59c39a7c0f293/nes-cartridges.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Zion Grassl / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Former Capcom and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/street_fighter_ii_the_world_warrior">Street Fighter II</a> producer Yoshiki Okamoto has been sharing insights into his time working on games for the NES / Famicom over on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWmUsHUltVQ&amp;ab_channel=%E5%B2%A1%E6%9C%AC%E5%90%89%E8%B5%B7%E3%82%B2%E3%83%BC%E3%83%A0ch">his YouTube channel</a>, and it gives us an interesting glimpse at game development at the time.</p>
<p>Translated by <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/capcom-veteran-says-nintendo-was-the-only-one-making-steady-revenue-from-nes-game-carts-capcoms-profits-really-took-off-with-the-ps1/">Automaton Media</a>, Okamoto detailed that it was harder for third-party developers such as Capcom and retailers to actually turn a profit making and selling games for the Famicom. And, from his experience, "only Nintendo had a guaranteed profit."</p>
<p>"Let’s say a Famicom cartridge sold for 10,000 yen at retail. Out of that, 3,000 yen went to the retailer. 4,000 yen went to the software developer, like Capcom, and 3,000 yen went to Nintendo," which sounds okay at first glance, but Okamoto clarifies that "Out of Nintendo’s 3,000 yen share, about 1,500 went to manufacturing contractors."</p>
<p>"Since Nintendo got paid upfront for the exact number of copies, manufactured the cartridges, and delivered them, what happened after that didn’t matter to them." Back in the '80s, Capcom was a relatively new developer, and had to pay around 3,000 yen per unit upfront.</p>
<figure><a title="NES cartridge profits" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/2fe46539a22f7/nes-cartridge-profits.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWmUsHUltVQ&amp;ab_channel=%E5%B2%A1%E6%9C%AC%E5%90%89%E8%B5%B7%E3%82%B2%E3%83%BC%E3%83%A0ch">Yoshiki Okamoto</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p>This resulted in the company taking out bank loans to ensure it could afford to pay the Big N, but this built up over time, as it apparently took Nintendo up to 3 months to supply cartridges. Then, Capcom had to send those cartridges and invoices to distributors, but it would rarely get paid immediately, instead receiving a promissory notice to say the money would be coming in 3 months.</p>
<p>That meant, often, that any profit would take up to 6 months to reach Capcom, which would likely be spent on clearing those bank loans. Okamoto also talks about unsold cartridge stock, where developers would often have leftovers thanks to having to over-order, as production took around 3 months. That adds another 3,000 yen unit to costs.</p>
<p>Okamoto still stresses that the NES and SNES were worth it for Capcom, despite cartridges "really only" benefitting Nintendo — and you only have to look at Street Fighter II sales figures to see that.</p>
<p>So, while cartridge-based systems, costs were higher — and that's still true today, from what we know — so when the PlayStation was announced, and disc manufacturing costs were cheaper, it was a dream for third-parties.</p>

<p>“Capcom’s profits skyrocketed with the switch from cartridges to discs,” Okamoto tells viewers, stating that not only were manufacturing costs cheaper, but that Sony would also return its share of the pay (1,600 yen of the 1,800 paid, for example) if Capcom returned any unsold CDs.</p>
<p>Faster restocking speeds, allowing devs to respond much quicker to sale spikes and interests, meant that Capcom was able to thrive even more in the disc-based era. But Nintendo was still a huge part of its success because it allowed them to grow their player base <em>and</em> get a foot in the door in the console gaming space.</p>
<p>It's a fascinating look at how video game development worked back in the late '80s and early '90s, and yet another look at why the PS1 did as well as it did. Who knows how different things would be with that Sony disc add-on for the SNES...</p>
<p><em>Let us know what you think of Okamoto's thoughts in the comments below</em>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Everstone Studio and NetEase have recently held the <a href="https://wccftech.com/where-minds-meet-final-test-july-24-31/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">final pre-launch test</a> for Where Winds Meet across both PC and PlayStation 5, and we've taken the opportunity to interview the development team once again (<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3564740/Where_Winds_Meet/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">nearly three years after the first time</a>) ahead of the release.</p>



<p>As a reminder, Where Winds Meet is an open world action adventure RPG in the Wuxia fiction, set in the Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period, which ran from around 907 to 979. In the game, players forge their own path as a Wuxia martial arts hero, a sword master raised amidst war and conflict while concealing a hidden identity. As they navigate a world on the brink of division and unrest, they will be confronted with difficult choices shaping their character's destiny. </p>



<p>The single player is said to last over 150 hours, but there's also plenty of online multiplayer options, as you'll read in the answers to our wide-ranging questions, which were provided by Lead Designer Chris Lyu.</p>

<p><strong>You set up various limited-time tests to gather feedback. Based on user feedback, what were the main changes you applied to the game?</strong></p>



<p>Our main goal has always been to share the world of Eastern martial arts in a way that feels new, exciting, and approachable for players everywhere. We want to present something truly different, but also make sure it’s easy for everyone to connect with, using familiar language and storytelling styles. We’ve held several test phases, and the feedback we’ve received has been incredibly valuable. Players’ insights have helped us make a number of targeted adjustments throughout development.</p>



<p>For localization, we’ve focused on keeping the philosophical depth and poetic spirit of Wuxia, while rewriting dialogue using language and expressions that are comfortable and relatable for global players. We’re also adding full English voice-overs, so the story can be experienced naturally, in players’ own languages. On the user experience front, we’ve simplified the early tutorial system to address concerns about too many mechanics at once, and we’ve redesigned the UI to make cultural symbols—like ink wash motifs and traditional patterns—clear and easy to recognize.</p>



<p>In terms of content, we’re adding explanations for mythological references (like clarifying the difference between the Chinese "Long" and the Western "dragon"), and we’re enhancing visual storytelling to make the cultural elements intuitive. We’ve kept core features like traditional Chinese clothing and landscape-inspired art, so even players unfamiliar with these elements can get an immediate sense of the game’s unique atmosphere.</p>



<p>For iconic systems such as Acupoint Hitting and Acupuncture, we’ve preserved their original forms, but added clearer feedback so the gameplay feels satisfying and intuitive. We’re also reworking social features to highlight universal themes—honor, brotherhood, and growth through adversity—that everyone can relate to. Of course, all of this is still a work in progress. We’re constantly optimizing and refining the game, and we truly hope that, once it’s released, players around the world will enjoy and immerse themselves in this Eastern martial arts world we’re building.</p>



<p><strong>When we last spoke, you said you were still adjusting the world&nbsp;size. Can you share more details about that now?</strong></p>



<p>The world of "Where Winds Meet" is constantly growing, both in scale and in richness. Right now, we’re working hard to prepare new regions and areas, continually adding diverse landscapes and unique architecture to bring the world to life. For this round of testing, we’re excited to open up the brand-new Kaifeng region. Compared to Qinghe—the area we featured in earlier tests—Kaifeng is 1.5 times larger. At its heart is a sprawling city covering over one million square meters, a grand metropolis designed to capture the imagination.</p>



<p>It’s a completely new, distinctive area, and we truly hope players will be as inspired by its scale and majesty as we are. When we designed Qinghe, our vision was to create a sense of “home.” Unlike bustling cities, Qinghe is peaceful and pure—endless fields, simple villages, and vibrant natural ecosystems. The region features sweeping wildlands, secluded settlements, winding rivers, and hidden caves. But it’s also shaped by history: set in the late Tang dynasty, when warlords divided the land and conflict was frequent. You’ll see war-torn ruins, deserted temples, secret underground passages, and yet also encounter villages rich with human warmth and stories. Local martial arts factions hide among the mountains, weaving together a landscape that is both complex and deeply narrative-driven.</p>



<p>Each of these areas feels like a slice of history, filled with dramatic and touching stories waiting to be discovered. Players can follow the main storyline to gradually unravel these mysteries, or explore freely and uncover hidden legends on their own, weaving their own adventures through the city’s alleyways and markets. Looking ahead, we have even more unique and fascinating regions planned for future updates. The world of "Where Winds Meet" will only keep expanding, and we can’t wait for players to experience all the stories and wonders we’re preparing.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Kaifeng-City-1-1-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Kaifeng, on the other hand, is one of China’s eight ancient capitals and was once among the largest cities in the world. In our game, we’ve recreated Kaifeng on a massive scale, striving to capture the unique spirit of the era. The city itself is like a vibrant painting, divided into several highly distinctive districts.</em> <em>Compared to Qinghe—the area we featured in earlier tests—Kaifeng is 1.5 times larger. At its heart is a sprawling city covering over one million square meters, a grand metropolis designed to capture the imagination.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>On the Steam page, you mentioned that Where Winds Meet features a 'rich, narrative-driven campaign'. Is there a full-fledged storyline? Can players make choices at&nbsp;specific&nbsp;points?&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>Our goal is to offer players a truly open-world experience with a high degree of freedom, while still telling a deep and complete main story. To achieve this, we’ve chosen to let player choices have the greatest impact in side quests, adventure stories, and world exploration, rather than on the main storyline. For example, when players explore the world and encounter various side missions or activities, they can approach challenges in different ways. You might choose to defeat your enemies with martial arts and accomplish your goal through combat. Alternatively, you could become a master persuader, using your words to convince opponents and avoid fighting altogether. Or, you might use your medical skills to heal those you meet—including your enemies—turning potential foes into friends. We want every player to feel that their decisions matter and that there are always multiple paths to any outcome.</p>



<p><strong>In our previous chat, you said the story wouldn't account for much of the whole game. Has that changed?&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p>



<p>That’s something we’ve thought about a lot. We want to weave the story seamlessly into the world itself, without ever breaking the core open-world experience. For us, the real magic of an open world comes from immersive exploration and meaningful interaction with the environment. So, instead of forcing the story upon players, we’ve carefully hidden narrative fragments throughout the world. Players are encouraged to discover and piece together these story elements on their own, through exploration and curiosity. As you uncover and connect these fragments, a sweeping epic gradually unfolds before you—one that feels truly personal and rewarding because you brought it together yourself.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Lively-City-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>"Where Winds Meet" is designed to give players the best of both worlds. In Single Player mode, you can fully immerse yourself in a rich, personal martial arts journey, experiencing the story at your own pace. At the same time, you can invite up to four other players into your game to explore the world together when you wish. If you’re looking for even more dynamic interactions, you can seamlessly enter the lively "Jianghu" multiplayer world. Here, you can team up with friends for challenging combat, cooperative missions, and shared adventures. These two modes are designed to complement each other, giving you the freedom to play however you like—whether you prefer exploring alone or joining forces with others, the choice is always yours.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Regarding multiplayer, the Steam page says that users can 'open up their world to a group of up to four players'. Does that mean the campaign and story can be fully completed with a group of players?</strong></p>



<p>"Where Winds Meet" is designed to give players the best of both worlds. In Single Player mode, you can fully immerse yourself in a rich, personal martial arts journey, experiencing the story at your own pace. Certain key storylines and moments are meant to be completed solo, allowing for a truly individual adventure. At the same time, you can invite up to four other players into your game to explore the world together when you wish.</p>



<p>If you’re looking for even more dynamic interactions, you can seamlessly enter the lively "Jianghu" multiplayer world. Here, you can team up with friends for challenging combat, cooperative missions, and shared adventures. These two modes are designed to complement each other, giving you the freedom to play however you like—whether you prefer exploring alone or joining forces with others, the choice is always yours.</p>



<p><strong>Indeed, these other features of Where Winds Meet sound a lot like an MMO: creating a guild, fighting in guild wars, multiplayer dungeons, epic raids, and more. There's also mention of 'thousands of fellow adventurers'. Can you explain how this is going to work? Are there different servers to choose from when transitioning to multiplayer?</strong></p>



<p>Our Multiplayer mode is designed specifically to recreate the authentic, living world of the "Jianghu"—the legendary community of martial artists and wanderers. We want players to truly feel what it’s like to live and interact in this ancient world, meeting and dealing with other real players who are all playing their own unique roles. The core of our Multiplayer design rests on two main pillars:</p>



<ol>
<li>The social enjoyment of real player interactions;</li>



<li>A strong sense of martial arts immersion and role-playing. With these in mind, we’ve created features where players can form and role-play as in-game organizations—like escort agencies or taverns—and work together to build their reputation through cooperative construction and activities. You might play as a traveling doctor and join with other healers to treat sick players, or take on the role of a shadowy vigilante, standing up for others and upholding justice in the world.</li>
</ol>



<p>We also offer flexible ways to access Multiplayer content. For example, if you encounter a particularly challenging boss, you can summon other players to assist you using the in-game support system. There are dedicated options for switching into Multiplayer mode whenever you want to enjoy these unique experiences. At this stage, players don’t need to choose servers—everything is seamlessly integrated to keep the community together. Ultimately, our goal is to create a dynamic, social, and immersive Jianghu where every player can find their own place and story.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/Exploration.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Our goal is to build "Where Winds Meet" into a living, ever-evolving world. We’re committed to supporting the game for the long term with major updates that expand the lore, deepen gameplay, and respond to player feedback. Future content will continue to enrich both the single-player story experience and the multiplayer social and cooperative aspects, ensuring there’s always something new for different types of players.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>As I understand it, Where Winds Meet will be free to play. Can you discuss the monetization system? Can you reassure fans that it won't be a pay-to-win game? Will there be a Battle Pass?</strong></p>



<p>Yes, "Where Winds Meet" is a free-to-play game. We offer options like a battle pass, a monthly subscription, and paid cosmetic items. And yes, there will be absolutely no pay-to-win content. So everyone can enjoy a fair and balanced experience.</p>



<p><strong>What are your post-launch plans? What kind of content can players expect after release, and how often?</strong></p>



<p>Our goal is to build "Where Winds Meet" into a living, ever-evolving world. We’re committed to supporting the game for the long term with major updates that expand the lore, deepen gameplay, and respond to player feedback.

<figure><a title="Elden Ring" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/e80359f0f02d0/elden-ring.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>There's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/nintendo-direct-partner-showcase-announced-for-tomorrow-31st-july-2025">a new Nintendo Direct coming very soon</a>, and it's a Partner Showcase, which means it's time for third parties to shine.</p>
<p>Since launch, we've seen some big hitters from publishers like Capcom (<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/street-fighter-6-years-1-2-fighters-edition">Street Fighter 6</a>), CD Projekt (<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/cyberpunk-2077-ultimate-edition">Cyberpunk</a>), and SEGA (<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/yakuza-0-directors-cut">Yakuza 0</a>), but despite a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/every-switch-2-launch-game-ranked">very solid lineup</a> at launch, you get the feeling that Nintendo has kept the floodgates closed to give early releases time to breathe.</p>
<p>However, with 25 minutes to fill, it looks like that's about to change. We're expecting big news, including release dates for previously announced games (hi there, FromSoft), but also a handful of surprises - or not-quite-surprises-but-exciting-all-the-sames. (<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/nis-accidentally-reveals-upcoming-switch-2-game-sparking-even-more-direct-speculation">And that one NIS itself apparently leaked.</a>)</p>
<p>Let us know in the poll at the bottom what you expect to see pop up (and leave a comment with other suggestions/wild dreams). First, though, let's take a look at Team NL's third-party predictions for upcoming Direct...</p>
<h2>Nine, Nine, NINE (Alana Hagues, deputy editor)</h2>
<figure><a title="UFO 50" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/3d3531e2ea8d1/ufo-50.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Mossmouth</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Me being who I am, my thoughts immediately darted to the handful of RPGs that haven’t got release dates yet – <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/elden-ring-tarnished-edition">Elden Ring</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade">Final Fantasy VII Remake</a> – but I think this is the place to announce something new. Not just a <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/final_fantasy_xvi">Final Fantasy XVI</a> port (which is <em>probably</em> coming; it’s on everything else).</p>
<p>Nope, I’m sticking my neck out, because it’s time to announce that darn <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/final_fantasy_ix">Final Fantasy IX</a> remake. Stop teasing me with new art and new merchandise; give me a reimagining of my favourite Final Fantasy game right now.</p>
<p>I think we’ll <em>probably</em> get a bit of indie coverage too; I’d love to see more of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/witchbrook">Witchbrook</a>, perhaps a cheeky little <a href="https://www.timeextension.com/games/steam/ufo_50">UFO 50</a> surprise. And hey, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hades-ii">Hades 2</a>’s final release date? It just had what is supposed to be its final patch. A date can’t be far off now.</p>
<p>Once again, I <em>refuse</em> to say the game with the initials <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hollow-knight-silksong">HK:S</a>. I want it, badly, though. But I can’t be disappointed this way.</p>
<h2>Ports and Puzzlers (Jim Norman, staff writer)</h2>
<figure><a title="Persona 3 Reload" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/f1f79560e1f33/persona-3-reload.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Atlus</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Okay, let me brush off my book of 'Switch Ports Plz' that I've been building for the past five years and see what jumps out, starting with some recent biggies that I think <em>could</em> be likely.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/metaphor_refantazio">Metaphor: ReFantazio</a> and <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/clair_obscur_expedition_33">Clair Obscur</a> have the 'huge-following-meets-unexpected-smash-hit-release' factor in them that makes me think a speedy Switch 2 version could be on the cards. Let's throw <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/persona_3_reload">Persona 3 Reload</a> into there too — nothing unexpected about that one, but there's no way that it doesn't come our way eventually.</p>
<p>Call me crazy, but I'm still holding out hope for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/marvels_midnight_suns">Marvel's Midnight Suns</a>. Remember when that was definitely 100% coming to Switch before it just... <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2023/05/marvels-midnight-suns-on-switch-no-longer-planned">quietly didn't</a>? Marvel could do with a little goodwill at the moment, and this would be one hell of a way to do it. Slot it in before <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/marvel-cosmic-invasion">Cosmic Invasion</a> and <em>boom</em>, you've got a Fall/Winter double bill.</p>
<p>The puzzler in me is still begging for <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps4/witness">The Witness</a> — which seems less likely every year — but a <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/blue_prince">Blue Prince</a> port feels like a no-brainer after the stellar launch a few months back, and I'd happily turn a blind eye to that 60+ hour PS5 playtime to start again on Switch 2.</p>
<p>And you know I can't touch on puzzlers without mentioning my beloved Hershel. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/professor-layton-and-the-new-world-of-steam">Professor Layton and The New World of Steam</a> is due out <em>this year</em> and we still don't have as much as a release window. C'mon, Level-5, don't break me.</p>
<h2>Vanquish Donkey Kong and bring me Snake Eater (PJ O'Reilly, staff writer)</h2>
<figure><a title="Hades 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/6a9aa250c84b9/hades-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Supergiant Games</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>I'm very excited about this Direct. I wanna see a strong lineup of games stretching into Xmas now. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> is old news. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a>? Ancient history. Give me a few big third-party heavy hitters, (most of which the team has already mentioned here, but I'll double down on wanting to see more Hades 2 details, alongside Clair Obscur, Elden Ring, and Blue Prince).</p>
<p>I'd love to see some oldies revamped. Give me <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps4/vanquish">Vanquish</a> and <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps4/bloodborne">Bloodborne</a>, y'know, the S-Tier stuff. More likely, I reckon we could see <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps4/red_dead_redemption_2">Red Dead Redemption 2</a> show up, and the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/resident_evil_2_-_cloud_version">Resi remake</a> games — some of which have appeared in cloud form — could perhaps see actual ports. Besides these, give me a Metaphor ReFantazio port with bonus Switch 2 exclusives.</p>
<p>I reckon we'll get everything I just typed out. So I might as well throw a port of <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/metal_gear_solid_delta_snake_eater">Metal Gear Delta: Snake Eater</a> in for good measure.</p>
<h2>Microsoft announcing something other than layoffs and AI guff (Gavin Lane, editor)</h2>
<figure><a title="Sea of Thieves" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/19991f33a5ba5/sea-of-thieves.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Microsoft</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Xbox Game Studios has been quiet about Switch 2 despite plans to expand its software catalogue to anything that'll play it. I've wanted <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/games/xbox-one/rare_replay">Rare Replay</a> on a Nintendo system for years, and it feels like a better fit now than ever. More likely we'll see the rumoured <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/games/xbox-one/sea_of_thieves">Sea of Thieves</a> port, <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/call_of_duty_black_ops_6">Call of Duty</a>'s <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/yes-call-of-duty-is-still-on-the-way-to-nintendo-hardware">promised Switch debut</a>, and something else - a <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/games/xbox-series-x/forza_horizon_5">Forza Horizon</a> potentially, or perhaps <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/indiana_jones_and_the_great_circle">Indy</a> shows up on Switch following his PS5 appearance. Some good news out of Microsoft, for once.</p>
<p>Beyond that, the team has covered the bases, loads of good stuff up there. But Alana mentioned my personal 'most wanted' - I've been jonesing for UFO 50 on Switch since it launched on PC, and I'd imagine Switch 2's extra grunt would help in the port department.</p>
<p>Aside from all the expected ports, a handful of exclusives would be lovely, too - or at least some new all-platform announcements. Nothing against Switch 2 ports (the more, the merrier), but after years of 'Yay, a fuzzier, portable version of a game everyone else played years ago,' some freshness wouldn't go amiss while Switch 2's still got that new system smell.</p>
<hr>
<p><em>Wow, not a single <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/baldurs_gate_3">Baldur's Gate 3</a> mention. Have we moved on? (Nah, we absolutely still want that, too.)</em><em><br></em></p>
<p><em>Let us know in the poll below which of these you'd most like to see, and take to the comments to shout out any wild cards you've got your heart set on.<br></em></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><div><p>While you can now start collecting <a href="https://www.theverge.com/pokemon/712965/pokemon-tcg-pocket-wisdom-of-sea-and-sky"><em>Pokémon TCG Pocket</em>’s Johto-themed Wisdom of Sea and Sky expansion</a>, two of the set’s rarest cards are being changed in response to concerns about art theft.</p></div><p>Soon after dataminers began posting images of Wisdom of Sea and Sky’s cards on Tuesday, Chinese artist lanjiujiu took to their X account with questions about <em>Pokémon TCG Pocket </em>using illustrations that seemed to have been traced from their own work. In particular, lanjiujiu pointed to Wisdom of Sea and Sky’s immersive Ho-Oh card drawn by <a href="https://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/SIE_NANAHARA">Sie Nanahara</a>, a Japanese illustrator who has previously produced a number of art pieces for The Pokémon Company.</p><p><em>Pokémon TCG</em> <em>Pocket</em>’s original immersive Ho-Oh card bore a number of visual similarities to a piece of art lanjiujiu was commissioned to illustrate in 2021. lanjiujiu did not specify who originally commissioned them, but their art clearly served as the reference for <a href="https://www.kaioland.com/en/product/pokemon-pc-house-ho-oh-resin-statue/">a resin statue sold by PC House Studio</a>, a company that makes unlicensed collectibles.</p><p>As <a href="https://www.polygon.com/pokemon/617134/pokemon-tcg-pocket-ho-oh-card-art-plagiarism"><em>Polygon</em> notes</a>, The Pokémon Company <a href="https://www.pokemon.com/us/legal/information">has made clear</a> that, when fans distribute art featuring any of the company’s copyrighted intellectual property, they are agreeing to “a royalty-free, non-exclusive, irrevocable, transferable, sub-licensable, worldwide license” that gives it the right to “use, transmit, copy, modify, and display Fan Art (and its derivatives) for any purpose.” Legally speaking, that means TPC would have been in the clear to keep the immersive Ho-Oh as is. But last night, the company announced that it now plans to update the card as well as Wisdom of Sea and Sky’s immersive Lugia, which also featured the Ho-Oh art as part of a short animation.</p><p>“We are also conducting a broader investigation to ensure no similar issues exist elsewhere in the game,” TPC said in <a href="https://x.com/PokemonTCGP/status/1950406273150693652/photo/1">a statement posted to X</a>. “To all our players who have been looking forward to this expansion, and to the talented illustrators who bring the Pokémon world to life, we deeply apologize for any inconvenience this has caused. We take this matter very seriously and are committed to strengthening our quality control processes to prevent this from happening again.”</p><p>The <em>Pokémon TCG Pocket </em>situation is the latest instance of a popular mobile card game getting in hot water for using fan art without contacting the original artist. Earlier this year, <em>Marvel Snap</em> faced similar accusations on two separate occasions — once regarding a <a href="https://www.thepopverse.com/gaming-marvel-snap-fan-artist-accuses-game-of-plagiarism-mbaku-pixel-art">pixel variant M’Baku card</a> that resembled an illustration by fan artist <a href="https://www.instagram.com/thatjaykart/?hl=en">Jason Kiantoro</a>, and another involving <a href="https://wccftech.com/marvel-snap-accused-of-stealing-art-from-kamen-rider-wizard/">a card of the Ancient One</a> that borrowed <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MarvelSnap/comments/1m2yom7/update_on_marvel_snap_stealing_assets_from_kamen/">visual elements from <em>Kamen Rider Wizard</em></a>.</p><p>In the latter instance, <em>Marvel Snap </em>simply changed a few details rather than releasing an entirely new card. It’s not clear when <em>Pokémon TCG Pocket </em>will update Wisdom of Sea and Sky’s immersive cards, but if you happen to pull them now, you’ll be greeted with a box that says “new art coming soon.”</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6OTE="><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Charles Pulliam-Moore</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/715823/pokemon-tcg-pocket-ho-oh-lugia-tracing-lanjiujiu]]></content:encoded>

New console-defining IPs have yet to arrive (maybe <em>Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet</em>?) and the live-service money pit Sony went all in on has accomplished little while tying up some teams for years. </p><p>Anchored by both<em> Death Stranding 2</em> and<em> Ghost of Yotei</em>, it would be farfetched to call 2025 a bad year for PlayStation games, but it’s certainly still feeling like a lighter one overall for the platform. Despite big third-party releases like <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em> and <em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em> early in the year, the second half feels lighter than it should for where we’re at in the PS5's lifecycle. Momentum should be building back up to another end-of-the-generation crescendo as developers squeeze every last optimization out of the hardware. It still feels like we’re waiting for the cavalry to arrive. </p><p>Enter Xbox.

Over half of the top 10 bestselling games on the console in the last quarter were from Microsoft, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3lv6vqqhmyc2w&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3lv6vqqhmyc2w" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">according to a new chart</a></span> shared this week by Circana director of game research Mat Piscatella.<em> Forza Horizon </em>5 and <em>The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered</em> were numbers two and three, while <em>Doom: The Dark Ages</em> and <em>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</em> held down the sixth and eight spots, respectively. (Perennial chart-toppers <em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 </em>and <em>Minecraft</em> also put in work.)<br></p><p> Xbox games will continue bolstering the PS5's lineup throughout the year. <em>Gears of War: Reloaded </em>brings the franchise to PlayStation for the first time next month alongside <em>Senua’s Saga: Hellblade II</em>, with<em> The Outer Worlds 2</em> providing a big sci-fi RPG shooter for the fall. There’s also the Microsoft-published<em> Ninja Gaiden 4</em>, and any other fall releases the company hasn’t gotten around to announcing yet. How long before the rumored <em>Starfield </em>port arrives as well? And is there a version of <em>Halo</em> that comes to PS5 sooner than an upcoming remake of <em>Halo: Combat Evolved</em>?<br></p><p>No modern console is singularly defined by its first-party exclusives anymore (unless you’re Nintendo), but at a time when PlayStation Studios has temporarily stalled, long-time rival Xbox has turned out to be an unexpectedly fortuitous pillar helping to hold up the PS5 as it nears its twilight years. It’s all thanks to a multiplatform strategy that seemed unthinkable just a few years ago. If Microsoft had kept all of its recently acquired toys exclusive, as seemed increasingly likely as recently as 2023, this year might have felt like an especially dire one for PS5 players. Instead, Microsoft’s expensive new mega-publishing apparatus has helped the console recover from a series of self-inflicted fumbles. </p><p>.</p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/ps5-best-selling-forza-horizon-elder-scrolls-oblivion-1851787356]]></content:encoded>
