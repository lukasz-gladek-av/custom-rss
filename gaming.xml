			<p>After Grand Theft Auto and Red Dead Redemption developer Rockstar fired 30-40 employees, the studio <a href="https://wccftech.com/gta-developer-accused-union-busting-after-firing-dozens-of-employees/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was accused of union busting by the Independent Workers Union of Great Britain</a>. Rockstar denied the accusations through a spokesperson and maintained that these employees <a href="https://wccftech.com/rockstar-says-fired-gta-developers-had-been-leaking-information/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">had leaked information on a public forum</a>.</p>



<p>The latest chapter of the story saw an anonymous employee of the award-winning game development studio <a href="https://gtaforums.com/topic/1004182-rockstar-games-alleged-union-busting/?do=findComment&amp;comment=1072605777" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">write a lengthy post on GTAForums</a>, the biggest public forum dedicated to the series of best-selling open world videogames. This poster's identity was allegedly verified by a moderator at GTAForums.</p>



<p>In the post, this employee claims that the fired workers were practically ambushed by the HR department, which called them over 'for a quick chat' and then handed a termination letter accusing them of misconduct related to Discord discussions, but provided no evidence or further details about the supposed offense. Those physically present were reportedly forced out within minutes. Others who were not at the office received a brisk phone call of less than two minutes and were notified that they would receive the aforementioned letter. Some of them were sick, even recovering from surgery, or on family leave, and this sudden termination leaves them financially vulnerable.</p>



<p>The anonymous employee adds that Rockstar fired critical staff, such as leads, artists, designers, programmers, and producers, many of whom had long tenures and clean records at the studio. Moreover, he counters the official statement, clarifying that the Discord channel in question was strictly for employee and union discussions about working conditions, not for game leaks; all those who got terminated were union members. The timing, the employee says, was clearly aimed at sabotaging union recognition, just as the union group had reached the size needed to initiate formal negotiations for better pay and working conditions.</p>



<p>The post concludes with a warning that if Rockstar gets away with this, it may do it again without facing repercussions. The employee also urges fans to support the fired workers by making a donation <a href="https://actionnetwork.org/fundraising/support-rockstar-workers-fighting-unfair-dismissals/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">via the Action Network</a>.</p>



<p>The controversy arises in the same week that brought us to yesterday, when Rockstar announced the second delay of Grand Theft Auto VI, <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-6-delayed-to-november-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">now slated for release on November 19, 2026</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Texas AG Ken Paxton is <a href="https://x.com/KenPaxtonTX/status/1986529630124126245">accusing Roblox</a> of “putting pixel pedophiles and profits over the safety of Texas children,” alleging in a lawsuit filed this week that it is “flagrantly ignoring state and federal online safety laws while deceiving parents about the dangers of its platform.”</p><p>The <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/26220082-texas-roblox-lawsuit/">lawsuit</a> accuses Roblox of deceptive trade practices for misleading parents and users about its safety features, and for creating a common nuisance by harboring a space “that has become a habitual destination for child predators engaging in grooming and child sexual exploitation.”</p><p>The lawsuit’s examples focus on instances of children who have been abused by predators they met via Roblox, and the activities of groups like <a href="https://www.ic3.gov/PSA/2025/PSA250306">764</a> which have used online platforms to identify and blackmail victims into sexually explicit acts or self harm. According to the suit, Roblox’s parental controls push only began after a number of lawsuits, and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/8/24265145/roblox-hindenburg-reseach-dau-child-safety-short-seller-report">a report released last fall by the short seller Hindenburg</a> that said its “in-game research revealed an X-rated pedophile hellscape, exposing children to grooming, pornography, violent content and extremely abusive speech.”</p><p>In August, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/760162/roblox-louisiana-lawsuit-child-predators-safety">Louisiana filed a similar lawsuit</a>, alleging that Roblox “permitted and perpetuated an online environment in which child predators thrive.” A couple of months later, the state of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/793711/another-state-is-suing-roblox">Kentucky also sued Roblox</a>, calling it “a hunting ground for child predators.” Last month, Florida Attorney General James Uthmeier <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/florida-attorney-general-issues-subpoenas-roblox-child-safety-rcna238711">subpoenaed Roblox</a> over similar allegations. It’s not just states suing Roblox, either. Numerous <a href="https://www.wfaa.com/article/news/local/texas-lawsuit-roblox-discord/285-ea17aa89-62bb-4bb5-8877-266b82f7efb7">families and Roblox players</a> have also sued the platform for alleged abuse, such as the cases detailed in Texas’s lawsuit.</p><p>Eric Porterfield, Senior Director of Policy Communications at Roblox, responded to the lawsuit in a statement to <em>The Verge</em>, saying, “We are disappointed that, rather than working collaboratively with Roblox on this industry-wide challenge and seeking real solutions, the AG has chosen to file a lawsuit based on misrepresentations and sensationalized claims.” He added, “We have introduced over 145 safety measures on the platform this year alone.”</p><p>Roblox <a href="https://corp.roblox.com/newsroom/2025/09/roblox-rdc-2025">reported in September</a> that it has over 111 million daily active users, many of whom are children. Earlier this year, Roblox announced plans to roll out <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/708670/roblox-trusted-connections-age-estimation-privacy">age verification</a> using IDs and facial scans, along with <a href="https://corp.roblox.com/newsroom/2025/08/open-sourcing-roblox-sentinel-preemptive-risk-detection">an AI system</a> intended to “detect early signals of potential child endangerment.”</p><p>It echoes similar changes on social media platforms like Discord, which also <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/650493/discord-age-verification-face-id-scan-experiment">began rolling out age verification</a> this year and has even been cited in some of the same lawsuits filed against Roblox, including <a href="https://abc7.com/post/online-gaming-parental-controls-lawsuit-claims-roblox-discord-failed-protect-galveston-texas-girl-alleged-predator/16294376/">one case</a> involving a 13-year-old from Texas. Social media platforms have often <a href="https://blog.ericgoldman.org/archives/2025/10/section-230-preempts-predator-access-claims-against-apple-snap-and-verizon-joan-doe-v-snap.htm">successfully used Section 230</a> to shield themselves from liability for individual users’ actions on their platforms, however — a barrier this Roblox suit, like others against the company, will face.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6ODAzMzIw"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Stevie Bonifield</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/816549/texas-roblox-lawsuit-child-safety]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Even as the consortium led by Donald Trump's haunted finger puppet Jared Kushner and Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund proceed with their wildly leveraged $50 billion <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ea-are-about-to-be-bought-for-50-billion-by-saudi-arabia-and-jared-kushners-investment-firms-claims-report">acquisition of Electronic Arts</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mass-effect">Mass Effect</a> executive producer Mike Gamble would like everybody to know that we're just fine, you guys. 
</p>
<p>Everything is hunkey-dorey over here at BioWare, a studio whose last few, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/new-dragon-age-the-veilguard-report-reveals-more-about-turbulent-development-including-forspoken-prompted-shift-from-snark-to-seriousness">famously</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/former-dragon-age-producer-posts-tell-all-video-about-the-messy-birth-of-ea-and-biowares-anthem">difficult</a> original videogame projects both severely undershot commercial expectations, as we gaze down the barrel of a buyout that will leave our parent organisation <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/eas-new-owners-are-making-a-huge-bet-on-generative-ai-cost-cutting-to-help-repay-a-20-billion-loan-claims-report">$20 billion in debt </a>and beholden to new owners who may disagree with everything we stand for, and who allegedly want to juice the screws with generative AI. Happy N7 Day, you bastards. Here's a cute coded message for you about the future of Mass Effect, 13 years since the last indisputably good one (sorry Nic). Please ignore the tears streaming down my face.
</p>
<p>OK, so this characterisation is both mean-spirited and quite silly, but I cannot read Gamble's <a href="https://blog.bioware.com/2025/11/07/n7-day-2025/">smiling words</a> without hearing somebody cocking a Kessler out of shot. "Like you, we've heard the rumors lately," he acknowledges, after some seasonal preamble. "You've made it clear you care deeply about what's next. So let's start by setting the record straight: the next Mass Effect game is in development, and EA and BioWare remain committed to telling more stories in this universe."
</p>
<p>For context, the next Mass Effect game was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bioware-are-making-a-new-mass-effect">sort-of-announced in 2020</a>. Since then, there has been the occasional snippet of info about <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bioware-tease-the-return-of-the-geth-in-the-next-mass-effect-game">the possible return of the Geth</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/mass-effect-5s-top-development-brass-includes-a-few-original-mass-effect-trilogy-veterans">the definite return of senior developers from the original trilogy</a>, but nothing of real substance, for BioWare's attention has been firmly fixed on the completion of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dragon-age-the-veilguard-top-tips-beginners">Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a>. The latter missed EA's opening quarterly targets, prompting <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bioware-quietly-lay-off-key-dragon-age-team-members-while-talking-up-the-next-mass-effect">mass layoffs</a> in a year when EA staff earned less on average while CEO Andrew Wilson <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ea-ceo-andrew-wilson-got-a-nice-pay-bump-last-year-while-the-companys-workers-earned-less-on-average">got himself a pay rise</a>. All this was before the proposed $50 billion dollar acquisition, which has led one former <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dragon-age">Dragon Age</a> executive to speculate that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/former-dragon-age-exec-thinks-eas-new-owners-might-sell-bioware-and-use-other-studios-for-saudi-arabian-pr">EA might sell BioWare or close them down</a>.
</p><p>"The truth is, the last few years have been an incredibly busy time at BioWare," Gamble went on. "But currently, the team is heads-down and focused exclusively on Mass Effect. We have a lot of universe to cover, lots of features to build, and lots of romances to figure out. We're excited by what we're building, and we promise you: when we're ready, it'll be a lot of fun to show."
</p>
<p>He also gave an update on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/if-amazon-make-a-mass-effect-tv-show-liara-should-be-the-main-character">the forthcoming Mass Effect TV show</a>, on which BioWare are collaborating with Amazon. Amazon, the revolting business empire that turned Sauron into an office creep, though I will concede they did an OK job with Fallout.
</p>
<p>"The writers room is going strong, and we've got a lot figured out about how it fits within the Mass Effect canon, and where it sits in respect to the new game," Gamble added. "The show will explore a brand-new story within the universe's timeline, and will be set after the original trilogy. It won't be a retread of Commander Shepard's story - because after all ... that's YOUR story, isn't it?" It is, Mike, and I'll thank Jeff Bezos to keep his stinking space colonisation fantasies away from my precious Normandy.
</p>
<p>If you're wondering why the blog post text looks weird, that's because as with N7 Day bulletins of yore, it contains a hidden message. Tot up all the italicised words, including game names, and you get "u r l Mass Effect k r g a n", unless I've missed a few. Which I guess points towards a website of some kind, while teasing that the Krogan are in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mass-effect-5">Mass Effect 5</a>. I've jumbled the letters up several times and I can't find a way to make it read "please Sony buy us".</p>

<p>Amazon’s Mass Effect series won’t be an adaptation of the original Commander Shepherd trilogy, confirms BioWare and EA. Even more so, it’ll be an original story set after Mass Effect 3.</p>



<p>The Mass Effect series has rightly become the premier narrative-driven game and a must-play for any gamer. Despite an okay third entry, the first two games are some of the best RPGs on the market, even after almost two decades. The last entry in the series, Mass Effect Andromeda, didn’t meet fan expectations, so any new project is welcome. Last year, Amazon announced that it would <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/mass-effect-tv-series-officially-in-development-at-amazon/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">be making a Mass Effect TV series</a> for Prime Video. Now, we know a bit more about the direction they are going, and it’s an interesting one.</p>

<p>As part of N7 Day, celebrating the USS Normandy in the game, <a href="https://blog.bioware.com/2025/11/07/n7-day-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a new blog was posted</a> on the official Mass Effect site. Series executive producer Mike Gamble spoke at length about the future of the series. While no updates on the new Mass Effect were shared outside of that it’s in production, the Amazon show was talked about. In the piece, he states,</p>



<p>“<strong>The writers room is going strong, and we’ve got a lot figured out about how it fits within the Mass Effect canon, and where it sits in respect to the new game</strong>,” Gamble says in the blog. “<strong>The show will explore a brand-new story within the universe’s timeline, and will be set after the original trilogy. It won’t be a retread of Commander Shepard’s story – because after all … that’s YOUR story, isn’t it?</strong>”</p>



<p>As Gamble said, the show is <strong>now in the writing stage</strong> and will, surprisingly, <strong>not adapt the original trilogy</strong>. This means that, more than likely, Commander Shepard and the Normandy crew will not be in attendance. However, despite being an original story, it will take place <strong>after the events of Mass Effect 3</strong>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As to what ending may be canon is unknown, but it’ll be interesting to see how it goes. Mass Effect is a space opera, so it does translate well into a show akin to Battlestar Galactica and Star Trek. As a fan, I’m excited to see what’s in store, especially since it’ll be a brand new adventure.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Call of Duty: Black Ops is a decades-spanning tale of deception, betrayal, and questionable psychiatry. It’s just one of CoD’s several separate subseries, but it’s by far the beefiest.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Back in 2010, it would have been easy for developer Treyarch to whip up some jungle assets and ship Call of Duty 7: Vietnam, but instead it unleashed a sprawling techno-thriller with all-you-can eat acronyms in which half of the characters are hallucinations and the rest are historical figures up to no good. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Black Ops is where Call of Duty gets weird– a stylish head trip with plot twists to spare. There’s a century’s worth of storyline in this epic espionage saga with more on the way, so consider this your pre-mission briefing ahead of Black Ops 7. Here is everything you need to know about the Black Ops story so far.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">BLOPS is a twisted web of flashbacks, dream sequences, and choice-driven alternate endings, so we’re charting the most chronological and canonical path we can. It begins with a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/call-of-duty-world-at-war">World at War</a>.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/04/reznov-cod-waw-1762272797747.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><h2 data-cy="title2">1942</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Stalingrad, September 1942. Red Army soldier Dimitri Petrenko claws his way through streets of corpses guided by his comrade, Soviet sniper Viktor Reznov. Reznov’s father was killed by the Nazis, creating in him a thirst for payback so deep that not even death will quench it.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">1945</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Petrenko and Reznov blast into Berlin and plant the hammer and sickle atop the Reichstag in 1945. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/call-of-duty-black-ops">Black Ops 1</a> reveals their post-war fates. Treacherous officer Nikita Dragovich and his pet sadist Lev Kravchenko drag our heroes into a task force hunting German scientist Friedrich Steiner– the evil genius behind a doomsday nerve gas called Nova 6. They corner the unrepentant jerk in the Arctic Circle where Steiner defects, to Reznov’s disgust.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Dragovich betrays Reznov and gasses his men with the Nova 6, killing several including our POV character from World at War. Reznov is rescued by the British but sinks the Nova stockpile beneath the ice.Dragovich, Kravchenko, and Steiner escape with the formula. Reznov is recaptured and sent to the Vorkuta prison camp where he waits 16 years for a new protagonist to bro out with.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/04/cod-blops-bay-of-pigs-1762273011596.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><h2 data-cy="title2">1961</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">During the Bay of Pigs invasion, the United States supports a coup that fails to overthrow Fidel Castro’s government. In real life, the U.S. provided funding, training, and air support for the revolution. In Black Ops 1, the CIA sends some special ops assassins to eliminate Castro: Alaskan Marine Alex Mason, Navy Seal Joseph Bowman, and chain-smoking, nigh unkillable veteran Frank Woods. Mason and Woods become the bedrock characters of BLOPS. Bowman, not so much.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Treyarch’s trio take down El Commandante’s body double. Mason is captured and taunted by an alive and well Fidel. Castro hands his prisoner over to returning Soviet heavies Kravchenko and Dragovich, who throw him in the gulag at Vorkuta.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The bad guys rewire Mason’s brain to become a sleeper agent controlled by a cryptic numbers station. Mason resists with the help of Reznov, his lone ally in the bowels of the Russian prison– Shawshank Redemption in a Soviet labor camp. As the men bond, Reznov programs a backdoor into Mason’s brain, compelling him to annihilate Steiner, Kravchenko, and Dragovich by any means necessary.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/04/cod-blops-escape-1762273161292.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><h2 data-cy="title2">1963</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Reznov engineers an uprising with a catchy 8-step plan that doubles as a conditioning tool. Big Vik sacrifices his own freedom so Mason can catch the last train out of Vorkuta, ending his two year imprisonment.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The extremely traumatized Mason is assigned to handler Jason Hudson and summoned to the Pentagon. Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara briefs them on Dragovich’s plans while Mason, who probably should have taken some self care PTO, starts to unravel. Mason’s mental breakdown crescendos when he meets John F. Kennedy as Dragovich’s programming surfaces.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Despite the fact that he just crashed out in front of the President, Mason’s bosses send him to sabotage the Soyuz space program and torch the team of Nazi scientists working on Nova 6. The team rescues double-agent Grigori Weaver, who loses an eye in the process. He doesn’t have a massive role beyond BLOPS 1, but he plays a pivotal part in the Zombies’ Dark Aether Saga– one of many characters who found new life within the mode.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Most operators would call it a day there, but because of Reznov’s programming, Mason literally cannot stop until he finds and ends Dragovich. The gang blows up his limo but they bail before the kill is confirmed.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Five days later, President Kennedy is assassinated in Dallas, Texas. Mason is present at the scene, but the CIA is quite unbothered by the brainwashed killing machine’s proximity to the crime of the century and keeps him on the payroll.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/04/cod-blops-russian-roulette-1762273354243.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><h2 data-cy="title2">1968</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">In Vietnam, Mason joins up with old buddies Woods and Bowman in search of Soviet intel on Nova 6. Mason meets with a defector that he believes is Viktor Reznov and they survive a lot of action setpieces together. The crew eventually arrives in Laos to secure a crashed plane carrying a cargo of Nova 6, but the gas is gone when they arrive. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">VC and Spetsnaz troops ambush team BLOPS and force them to play Russian Roulette in a gruesome homage to The Deer Hunter. After Bowman is brutally murdered, Mason and Woods fight their way free, hijack a Hind, and bust up Kravchenko's headquarters, saving “Reznov” once again. Woods sacrifices himself to save Mason from the cornered Kravchenko, and both men are presumed dead. In true Call of Duty fashion, neither are.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Meanwhile, Weaver and Hudson make contact with Dr. Steiner, who is now terrified of Dragovich and desperate to flip on him. He reveals that Dragovich is hours away from ordering sleeper agents to unleash Nova 6 across the U.S., provoking nuclear war. Hudson and Weaver rush to Steiner’s lab on Rebirth Island, but Mason and his guardian angel beat them to it. They infiltrate the facility on their own and find Steiner. Reznov executes the Nazi scientist, but that’s not what Hudson and Weaver see. Mason is alone, and they watch him pull the trigger.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Hudson and Weaver take Mason in and race to unravel his severely compromised brain to stop World War 3. Their desperate interrogation makes up the iconic frame narrative of Black Ops 1. “The numbers, Mason!” ranks among Call of Duty’s most immortal lines– right up there with “50,000 people used to live here” and “f***ing campers.” </p><p data-cy="paragraph">We learn the truth: Reznov died in Vorkuta and the disgruntled old soldier who's been following Mason around is a Fight Club-style figment of his imagination.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Mason decodes the sequence and leads a strike on Dragovich’s undersea numbers station. In the final showdown, Mason strangles Dragovich and puts an end to his decades-spanning plot. This will not be the last of Mason’s problems.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">With Black Ops in the bag, we leap forward four games in the release order to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-cold-war">Black Ops: Cold War</a>, set in the brief window of the 1980s before the flashback sequences of Black Ops 2. Dragovich is dead, Mason is half out of his mind, and a new figure named Persus has emerged from the ashes.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/04/cod-blops-cold-war-1762273438153.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><h2 data-cy="title2">1981</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Soviet spymaster “Perseus” amasses power and creates his own rogue intelligence network to sow discord across the world. By 1981, they’ve stolen an American-made nuclear bomb courtesy of Operation Greenlight, an extremely dubious top-secret program that hid scorched-earth nukes all across Europe.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Woods is back in action after blowing up and escaping from a POW camp. Hudson asks him to join Mason and new super spy guy Russell Adler to hunt down Perseus for the CIA. They capture an injured Perseus lieutenant and bring them in for some light MKULTRA. M16 agent Helen Park helps implant the Perseus agent with false memories of serving with Adler in Vietnam in order to exploit them for intel. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Reborn as “Bell,” the new player character joins Adler’s team, where they are kept in check with a “would you kindly” style control phrase: “We’ve got a job to do.” They gather a CIA Scooby gang and uncover a Spetsnaz training ground dressed up like an idyllic American suburb, complete with an arcade and period-appropriate Doritos. They confirm the stolen nuke was of U.S. origin, and learn the truth about Operation Greenlight– and their boss’s role in it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Hudson was not only aware of the plan, he was in charge of it. The squad shelves their beef and plots to steal a list of sleeper agents from KGB headquarters in Moscow.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">With the help of a mole named Belikov, Adler and Bell infiltrate the Lubyanka and cross paths with Mikhail Gorbachev and a bunch of Soviet spooks, including young Imran Zakhaev, the future final boss of Modern Warfare. The two series don’t cross over very often, but there are sporadic hints that the worlds of Treyarch and Infinity Ward aren’t as separate as they seem.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The agents go loud and escape with the sleeper list, which points them to a Greenlight scientist named Hastings. By the time they find him it’s too late– Perseus has the activation codes. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Adler abandons his totally subtle mind-meld scheme and force-feeds drugs directly into Bell’s brain instead. Their past as a Perseus agent resurfaces along with the location of the secret base.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The story can go a few different ways from here, but as far as canon is concerned, Bell lets Adler’s intrusion slide and gives up the real location. The team destroys Perseus’ monastery stronghold and secures the nukes, but the man himself escapes. Hudson, wanting to clear up any loose ends, orders Adler to execute Bell as the story concludes.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Cold War sits awkwardly in the Black Ops timeline– you’d think someone would mention the whole “seeding a continent with nukes” thing over the next few decades of the story. Still, the retcon works, and characters like Park will pop up in future games. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The real main event of Black Ops in the 1980s isn’t Perseus, however– it’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-ii">Black Ops 2</a>'s Raul Menendez, a ruthless arms dealer turned charismatic cult leader locked in a 40-year blood feud with Mason and Woods.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/04/cod-blops-2-interrogation-1762273600314.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><h2 data-cy="title2">1986</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Alex Mason has retired to Alaska’s frozen tundra, raising his son David and being generally irritable. He should try mushing wolf-dogs. Ex-handler Hudson and Oliver North come a-knocking with one last job: “Uncle” Woods has gotten himself captured again while messing around in the Angolan civil war.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Mason and Hudson rescue Woods and in the process Mason crosses paths with an ice-cold young arms dealer named Raul Menendez. The men scuffle, Mason shoots his eye out and leaves him for dead. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">At this point in his career, Mason has slaughtered entire legions of hostile NPCS. What difference does one more gun-runner make? But Menendez survives with a gnarly scar and swears vengeance on the spook. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Raul was raised during Nicaragua’s dirty wars, watching U.S. backed Contras tear his homeland to shreds. His animosity towards America became personal when his beloved sister Josefina was nearly burned alive by a greedy American businessman. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Raul and his father built a massive drug cartel that attracted the ire of the CIA. The agency merced Papa Menendez in front of his son, which further soured Raul’s feelings towards the United States.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">By 1986, he’s running arms with the Soviets in Afghanistan. Mason and company are sent to intervene, linking up with local freedom fighters and  a Chinese contact named Tian Zhao. They survive a Soviet attack led by Lev Kravchenko, last of the Dragovich loyalists.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The sight of Kravchenko does a number on Mason’s, let’s face it, completely cooked brain, but it’s Woods who canonically delivers the killshot after they learn about a mole in the CIA. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Mujahideen leader turns on the Americans under orders from Menendez, leaving the squad to die in the desert. A delirious Mason sees “Tricky Vik” Reznov ride in on horseback to save the day.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The CIA finds the Menendez family compound in Nicaragua and cuts a check to Manuel Noriega, the real-life Panamanian dictator on the U.S. payroll. Noriega’s goons storm the compound and brutalize Josefina. Raul goes berzerk. Noriega shoots his own men and lets Menendez go as a favor, which Raul returns by nearly beating the general to death.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">When they finally meet, Woods hurls a grenade meant for Raul, but a bad bounce means it kills Josefina instead. Raul survives, and vows that Woods, and the entire world, will one day feel his absolute loss. Three years later, Menendez puts his plan into motion.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/04/cod-blops-2-mason-1762273856264.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><h2 data-cy="title2">1989</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">The U.S. invades Panama with the aim of overthrowing Noriega. In real life, Noriega was smoked out of the Vatican embassy by Van Halen music on loop. In BLOPSworld he’s captured by (who else?) Mason and Woods. Hudson informs his men that Noriega is a “high-value individual” to be exchanged for an anonymous prisoner.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Hudson tells Woods that the hooded captive is Raul Menendez, and orders him to shoot the restrained prisoner during the swap. To Woods’s horror, the man is really Alex Mason, and while the canon isn’t absolutely clear about this, it’s widely believed that Mason is no more. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Afterwards, the real Menendez appears, blows away Woods’s kneecaps, and reveals that he’s kidnapped Mason’s son David. Menendez used the boy as leverage to force Hudson to do his bidding. He slits Hudson’s throat with Josefina’s locket, leaves David traumatized, and spares Woods to suffer with the guilt of killing his closest friend.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In one fell swoop, two lead characters from the previous Black Ops game were wiped off the board and another horribly mutilated, leaving young David to pick up the pieces– a story to which we’ll return after a detour through the early ‘90s for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-6">Black Ops 6</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Woods spends the intervening years riding a desk and raising David as best he can without revealing the truth behind his father’s death. The CIA believes that Russell Adler is the mole, paid off by Menendez to teamkill his CoD clan. Woods doesn’t buy it, and suspects a shadow faction inside the agency itself: Pantheon.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Pantheon began as a CIA subdivision in the ‘70s, experimenting with a psychotropic super-soldier serum called Project: Cradle. After a disastrous outbreak of the Cradle virus turned survivors into hallucinating rage monsters, Deputy Director Daniel Livingstone officially disavowed it. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The group reformed as an independent rogue cabal, reviving Cradle in secret while fanning the flames of America’s forever wars.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking of which, grab your best bootleg Bart Simpson shirt and get ready to rip some packs of Gulf War generals, because it’s 1991 and we’re invading Iraq… the first time.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/04/cod-blops-6-1762274241865.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><h2 data-cy="title2">1991</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Wheelchair-bound Woods is fielding a new team: his protege Troy Marshall, ops specialist Jane Harrow, and the enigmatic William “Case” Calderon. The squad is tasked to extract Saddam Hussein’s defecting defense minister Saeed Alawai, but their target is executed on the spot by fugitive Russell Adler.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Adler insists that the CIA is compromised, and says he couldn’t allow the man to fall into Pantheon’s clutches. He surrenders himself with a simple riddle for Woods: “Bishop takes Rook.” Livingstone dismisses his warning and suspends the squad, who decide to follow Adler’s trail anyway.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Rook” refers to an old KGB safehouse in Bulgaria that Adler and Woods discovered during their adventures in the ‘70s. The disgraced team shacks up there and recruits some new allies: German tech guy Felix Neumann and Sev Dumas, an assassin from the fictional city-state of Avalon. She was trained and betrayed by the Guild, an underground criminal network that will become way more important in the sequel.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">With the gang assembled, they break out Adler from a CIA black site deep beneath the U.S. Capitol building while Arkansas Governor Bill Clinton works the room at a glitzy gala upstairs..</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Back at the Rook, Adler explains that Pantheon was in bed with Hussein, trading experimental weapons for access to his definitely-real WMD facilities. He tells them about Cradle and where they might find it. Next stop: Saddam’s palace.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">With help from Cold War’s Helen Park, the rogue BLOPers infiltrate Hussein’s gilded bunker. Among his hoard of treasures, the squad finds a sample of Cradle. They also discover that Jane Harrow is Pantheon’s mole within the CIA and trace the virus’s origin to a research facility on American soil. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">When they arrive in Kentucky, Case falls down an elevator shaft and is exposed to the Cradle, experiencing a Zombie nightmare.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Case overcomes his BLOPs protagonist amnesia and unlocks his past– he was the failed original test “case” for a Cradle-powered super-soldier. The project was scrapped, his memories were erased, and he was welcomed back into the loving arms of the CIA, which remains oddly unconcerned with the scrambling of its employees’ minds.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">A casino heist points the squad towards Gusev, Harrow’s Cradle scientist. He’s hiding out in Kuwait, so Case, Adler, and Lawrence Sims, another Cold War veteran, ground his flight.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Gusev tells the gang that Pantheon’s headquarters is located in an old Soviet prison camp– Victor Reznov’s old haunt Vorkuta, ground zero for the entire Black Ops saga.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In the most shameless nostalgia fest since Snake returned to Shadow Moses, team Rogue BLOPs revisits the gulag and apprehends the traitorous Harrow. They dose her with truth serum and drag the whole story out of her: She blames Adler for the home-invasion deaths of her parents and joined Pantheon for revenge. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Their master plan is to use the Cradle for a false-flag terror attack on Washington, D.C. The Iraqis would take the fall, Livingstone would be KIA, and Harrow/Pantheon would be in charge of the CIA.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Pantheon invades the Rook, setting off a climactic safehouse standoff. Harrow attempts to escape on a helicopter, but Case boards her vessel mid-flight. Completely geeked on Cradle, Case strangles Harrow in a blind rage and sends the chopper crashing into a river, where both are presumed dead. Sure they are!</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Livingstone makes peace with Woods, Adler, and Marshall and encourages them to hang out their shingle as an off-the-books Black Ops cell. In a final stinger, we see that Pantheon is down but not out as another mole, Jackson Caine, slips into Livingstone’s office and hacks into his computer.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The story continues 44 years later in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-7">Black Ops 7</a>, but first there’s the matter of Menendez to attend to.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In 2014, a social movement named Cordis Die emerges from the internet. Its charismatic leader Odysseus gains followers with his impassioned rants against the corrupt 1%. He engineers riots in Iran and North Korea and develops an unstoppable computer worm out of the rare earth metal Celerium with the help of hacker Chloe Lynch.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">He uses it to hack the Chinese stock exchange in 2018, pinning the blame on the U.S. and triggering a second cold war between NATO and China amid an escalated drone arms race. Mason’s former ally Tian Zhao is in charge of China’s SDC and working with Menendez, combining their vast resources to heat up the conflict and usher in a new world order.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/04/cod-blops-2-2025-1762274452500.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><h2 data-cy="title2">2025</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">By the far off distant future of 2025, Cordis Die has amassed two billion followers, none of whom realise their cult leader is the Nicaraguan narco-terrorist, and that the entire “Occupy BLOPS” movement was just a cover for one man’s mad-on against Woods and Mason. Young David Mason is now a Navy Seal operator named “Section” who still checks in on his dear old Uncle Frank.  </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Menendez makes the first move by visiting a still-living, still-smoking Woods in the Vault, a retirement home for Mimis and Pop Pops with red in their ledger. He leaves behind the pendant used to murder Hudson. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Section and his JSOC boys Mike Harper and Javier Salazar visit Woods for some action-packed ‘60s flashbacks. The old man gives them the dirt on his tragic history with Menendez and clues them in about Celerium. The young bucks embark on a series of missions investigating Menendez, and his massive mercenary army.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The gang eavesdrops for intel about a cyber weapon called “Karma.” Section, Harper, and Salazar search for it on the decadent floating city of Colossus, where they discover that “Karma” is actually Chloe Lynch, and that Menendez is trying to kill her to keep her quiet about the Celerium computer worm. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Her fate has yet to be confirmed by canon, but if they do save Karma from top henchman DeFalco, she uncovers Menendez's ultimate plan: on June 19th, Freedom Day, he’s going to hijack the U.S. military’s drone system and unleash an electronic rumbling on every major city within both global superpowers. That’s tomorrow.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Over Section’s objections, his commander Admiral Briggs decides it’s high time to grab Menendez. They contact Farid, a deep cover operative observing Menendez ignite a revolution in Yemen. Farid sacrifices himself to save Harper and Melendez is easily captured and taken onboard the aircraft carrier U.S.S. Barack Obama.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Surprise! We were playing right into Menendez’s brilliant ruse the entire time. It’s the “getting caught was part of my plan” gambit that was all the rage in the late aughts, though to be fair, Black Ops 2 scribe David S. Goyer also wrote the screenplay for the trope-defining Dark Knight.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Cordis Die goons storm the Obama and Menendez seizes control of the ship with the help of his double agent, your now ex-BFF Salazar. He uploads the virus and takes over the U.S. military drone network before escaping. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Since canon presumes you completed the bonus Strike Missions and took down Tian Zhao, Chinese planes will save the ship and ally with JSOC against the drones, ending the cold war for good.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As thousands of metal death machines swarm upon populated cities, Section, Harper, David Petraeus, and the President of the United States are shot down in a war-torn Los Angeles. Under siege by an army of killer drones, the men escort POTUS to safety in one the most spectacular setpieces in a series that has a lot of them. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">JSOC and China trace the drone control signal to a Cordis Die facility in Haiti and stage a full-scale invasion. Menendez goes live when they arrive, but instead of destroying the world’s cities he blows up every single one of the drones instead, crippling American military infrastructure. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Section finally captures his father’s murderer and makes a martyr out of Menendez– which is exactly what he wanted. He posts a posthumous YouTube video instructing his billions of followers to take advantage of the drone-free power void and seize control of the United States.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Treyarch has been pretty firm that the "Menendez dies” ending of Black Op 2 is canonical, although his promised Cordis Die uprising fizzles out. </p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/08/20/blops7-1755708228049.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><h2 data-cy="title2">2035</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 is set a decade after the end of BLOPS 2. Frank Woods has finally gone to that old soldiers’ home in the sky and David Mason is still dorkily calling himself Section and leading a new team named “Specter One,” with old faces like Harper and Marshall and new ones like the bionic 50/50.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The world is still shaken from the drone incident. The Guild has shed its shady beginning and is reborn as a powerful tech giant offering protection in uncertain times. In 2035, the dead Menendez shocks the world with a prophecy and a threat: in three days, your streets will run red with your blood. He’s presumably referring to a new fear-based macguffin that pushes minds to the edge of consciousness with typical Black Ops trippiness.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s a “five minutes into the future” setting, a touch more sci-fi than Modern Warfare but closer to a tomorrow that seems just around the corner. It’s not the first time that Black Ops has moved forward in the timeline, and it’s nowhere close to the giant leap taken by Treyarch for Black Ops 3.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/11/04/cod-blops-3-1762274652978.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><h2 data-cy="title2">2062</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Set in 2062, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-3">Black Ops 3</a> is the odd duck in an already pretty weird franchise. It depicts a surreal, Phillip K. Dickian future that’s been forged in the fallout of Cordis Die’s drone war, where the old geopolitical order has collapsed and optimized into two bloated megafactions locked in endless proxy wars. New technology makes air supremacy obsolete. Mechs roam the battlefield, and wallrunning supersoldiers interface directly with the grid.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Black Ops 3’s campaign is ambitious and strange, but it feels less like the next chapter in the Black Ops saga and more of an optional epilogue, the kind of ending you’d reload a save to avoid. There’s connective tissue to the larger mythos, but none of the classic characters or grudges survive the time skip. Also, BLOPS being BLOPS, most of the action turns out to be the digital experiences of a disembodied dying consciousness inside a simulation.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While there’s no reason to doubt its canonicity, Black Ops 3 is not the focus of Black Ops 7– The latest title has far too much unfinished business in the past to linger in the far-flung future. Still, the slow drift towards sci-fi is undeniable, and it makes total sense: Black Ops has spent the last 15 years strip-mining the shadow wars of the 20th century, and there’s really only one direction left to go.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Will Black Ops lose its psycho wetworks swagger if it moves beyond the current day? Is there still more juice to squeeze from our clandestine past? Or is it time for Treyarch and Raven Software to invent something entirely new? After all, if we learned anything from Call of Duty: Black Ops, it’s that identities are anything but permanent.</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-timeline]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Mass Effect developer BioWare has reaffirmed its commitment to making the series' next game, just weeks after <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ea-goes-private-in-55-billion-deal-with-pif-silver-lake-and-affinity-partners-andrew-wilson-to-remain-as-ceo">publisher EA agreed a $55 billion deal to go private</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In a <a href="https://blog.bioware.com/2025/11/07/n7-day-2025/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">blog</a> posted today to mark the Mass Effect franchise's annual N7 Day celebrations, franchise boss Mike Gamble said he wanted to set "the record straight" after all the "rumors lately."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Let's start by setting the record straight: the next Mass Effect game is in development, and EA and BioWare remain committed to telling more stories in this universe," Gamble wrote. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Fans had questioned whether EA would remain committed to Mass Effect — and BioWare in general — following the completion of its enormous deal, and after a lackluster response to the studio's previous game, Dragon Age: The Veilguard. Today's statement is clearly meant to calm fan concerns — though actual new information on the next Mass Effect game remains scarce.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"The truth is, the last few years have been an incredibly busy time at BioWare," Gamble continued today. "But currently, the team is heads-down and focused exclusively on Mass Effect. We have a lot of universe to cover, lots of features to build, and lots of romances to figure out."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Yes, while it's not a surprise, fans at least now have solid confirmation that you will be able to romance more sci-fi characters, head tendrils and all.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Every IGN Mass Effect Review</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"We're excited by what we're building, and we promise you: when we're ready, it'll be a lot of fun to show," Gamble concluded. "Until then, thank you for your patience because y'all are thirsty for news and I see you looking for secret meaning in my tweets (okay, sometimes they have secret meaning)."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's worth noting that numerous letters of the above text are italicised in BioWare's original blog post, which when put together spell out the words "<em>url krogan</em>." Is there some fresh new krogan lore sitting hidden somewhere on the BioWare blog for fans to find? We are scouring the site now to find out.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Other celebrations today will include new Mass Effect gear to buy, and free crossover items within both Apex Legends and Skate (which should hopefully avoid the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dead-space-fans-blast-cardboard-isaac-clarkes-absurd-35-pricetag-in-free-to-play-skate">criticism of Skate's recent and rather pricey Dead Space crossover</a>).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Finally, in other Mass Effect news, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mass-effect-tv-series-wont-retread-shepards-story-and-will-be-set-after-the-original-trilogy">BioWare today confirmed that Amazon's upcoming TV adaptation would feature a new story set after the events of the series' original trilogy</a> — rather than rehashing Commander Shepard's adventures, as seen in the series' original trilogy. It's a canny move which avoids contradicting players' own stories — and something that could potentially see the TV show tying into the next Mass Effect game, which fans believe will be set hundreds of years after Mass Effect 3's endings.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"For everyone yelling at me because we didn’t use N7 Day to provide a whole bunch of info... I mean, I get it," Gamble subsequently <a href="https://twitter.com/GambleMike/status/1986833146873024598" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted</a> on social media. "I’m a fan too. I want you to see stuff. But it’s not the time... yet. Has it been years since announce? Yes. Have we been busy? Yes. Are we NOW 100% on Mass Effect? Also yes."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">BioWare first confirmed it would develop another Mass Effect game back in 2020, via a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/new-mass-effect-revealed">cinematic trailer that showed a return for fan-favorite character Liara</a>, now sporting an older look. Subsequent years have seen the studio tease out a handful of further Easter eggs pointing to the state of the galaxy, many years on — but clearly the project remains some way off from actually releasing.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

The Nvidia GeForce RTX 3050 GPU and Intel 13th Gen i5 CPU fall squarely in the entry-level category for graphics and processing power. The Victus will play many games, including newer AAA titles, but graphically intensive titles will often require you to play with a mix of low and medium settings.</p><p>The Victus has 8GB RAM and a 512GB SSD; both figures are often viewed as the minimum for gaming PCs these days. Many AAA games have recommended configurations that include 16GB RAM, but 8GB meets the minimum for visually demanding titles like Cyberpunk 2077 and Red Dead Redemption 2. Just be aware that with a laptop such as this Victus, you sometimes need to lower the resolution to 720p get better than 30fps.</p><p>Even with its drawbacks, the HP Victus is a bargain for $480, especially for those who want to play indies and older AAA games on PC. For comparison, this laptop is more powerful than the Steam Deck, and millions of gamers are happy with the performance on Valve's handheld. The Victus has sleek form factor and a full keyboard with a numpad. In terms of its appearance and build quality, the Victus is one of the better entry-level options out there.</p><hr><p><strong>Sign up for GameSpot's Weekly Deals Newsletter:</strong></p><hr><div data-embed-type="pinbox" data-ref-id="4304">  <ul>                              <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/disney-plus-collector-edition-4k-blu-ray-star-wars-and-marvel-original-series/1100-6535976/">Star Wars 4K Steelbook Collector's Editions Get Limited-Time Price Cuts</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/legend-of-zelda-hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment-nintendo-switch-2-exclusive-preorder-guide/1100-6534713/">Hyrule Warriors: Age Of Imprisonment Launch-Day Delivery Still Available At Amazon</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-officially-licensed-wireless-controllers-zelda-super-mario-pokemon-deals/1100-6535215/">Get Zelda-Themed Switch 2 Controllers For As Low As $25 For A Limited Time</a></li>                          <li>         <span>+ Show More More Gaming, Tech, and Entertainment Deals &amp; Preorders Links (5)</span>       </li>          <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/best-xbox-elite-series-2-wireless-controller-deal-holiday-2025/1100-6535861/">Xbox Elite Series 2 Deal: Save $60 On Microsoft's Premium Wireless Controller</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-xbox-wireless-controller-best-deals-black-friday-2025/1100-6534446/">Xbox Wireless Controllers Discounted To $40 In Early Black Friday Sale</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/8bitdo-pro-3-wireless-controller-nintendo-switch-2-recommendation/1100-6533157/">8BitDo Pro 3 Nintendo Switch 2 &amp; PC Controller Discounted To New Low Price</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/lego-batman-classic-tv-series-batmobile-building-set-amazon-deal/1100-6535836/">Lego Classic TV Series Batmobile Gets Rare Discount At Amazon</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/digimon-the-movies-4-6-blu-ray-collection-up-for-preorder-at-amazon/1100-6535809/">Digimon The Movies 4-6 Blu-Ray Collection Up For Preorder At Amazon</a></li>   </ul> </div>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/thumper-follow-up-thrasher-makes-steam-debut-vr-non-vr/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/thrasher-the-follow-up-from-the-artist-and-composer-behind-thumper-is-now-out-on-steam.1347193/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Thumper is an intense rhythm game loved by VR and non-VR fans alike, for its soundtrack, incredible lighting, and engaging gameplay. It's also nearly a decade old, but in the meantime, artist and composer behind Thumper, Brian Gibson, hasn't been sitting on his hands. Gibson, alongside Mike Mandel under their new developer label, Puddle, released a follow-up to Thumper titled Thrasher in July 2024.</p>



<p>The only problem with Thrasher is that when it arrived last July, it was only available as a VR title for Meta Quest and Apple Vision Pro users. That's officially changed, however, with Thrasher making its Steam debut today, November 7, 2025. It's playable in PC VR, but non-VR users will be happy to know it is also playable as a regular-old flatscreen game.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="THRASHER Steam Release Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ilm63FtWc4U?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Unsurprisingly, it's another cornucopia of lights and sounds blending to create what could be just as transcendent an audiovisual experience as Thumper before it. There's no indication yet if Thrasher will come to Xbox consoles as a flatscreen game and to PlayStation as a flatscreen and VR game with PS VR2, but with the bulk of the work done to make Thrasher work as a flatscreen game for PC, hopefully, those ports are on the horizon.</p>



<p>In the meantime, players on PC can jump into the 27 levels in Thrasher across its nine main stages and three game modes, and if you're already a fan of Gibson's work (and you have Thumper in your Steam library), <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2702300/view/595164831678464806?l=english">then you're entitled to a special discount on Thrasher</a>. If not, then no need to fret as the game is also available at a 10% launch discount for a limited time.</p>

Throughout </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-lumiose-city-ending-zohran-mamdani-2000641431"><span>Lumiose City</span></a><span>, you’ll find Pokémon residing in and out of its designated Wild Zones, and while some of them just kinda spawn into the space, </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A </span></i><span>has a handful of ‘mons that feel more intentional in their placement. Trubbish, the literal trash bag Pokémon, can be found in alleys and around other areas where trash is discarded. A lot of the time, when you see one of these smelly little dudes lounging around, nearby humans are complaining about how they smell bad and they want them gone. So when you do actually get around to catching one of these poison-type Pokémon, an adorable but sad interaction occurs.</span></p> <p><span>If you find a Trubbish hanging out around a bunch of garbage and lift a Poké Ball like you’re going to catch it, the little trash bag smiles and does a little dance, as if it’s excited that someone is finally picking it after spending most of its life being shooed away from the general public. It would almost make me want to catch one and add it to my team if it weren’t so ugly and smelly.&nbsp;</span></p>

   <p><span>Trubbish lives a hard life in the city. There’s even a whole side quest in which a restaurant asks you to get rid of a group of the sentient garbage bags because their foul odor is bothering the customers. But they are simply little guys who want to be loved like any other Pokémon. It’s sad as hell that these stinky critters are so used to being mistreated that even the slightest hint that they might be accepted makes them dance a little jig.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Hopefully, there will be more of these cute, unscripted interactions in </span><i><span>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</span></i><span> after the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-mega-dimension-dlc-new-raichu-2000641644"><i><span>Mega Dimension</span></i></a><span> DLC adds a plethora of new monsters to the game when it launches on December 10.</span></p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/switch-2-price-hike-nintendo-sale-discount-2000642086</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nintendo-is-holding-the-line-against-a-500-switch-2-unless-there-are-more-tariffs.1347184/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The Switch 2’s controversial price tag didn’t stop it from becoming <a href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-sales-nintendo-10-million-mario-kart-world-2000641025">the fastest-selling console at launch ever</a>. Will it stay $450 or break the $500 barrier due to tariffs and inflation? In what should come as some small relief, Nintendo recently signaled that fans don’t have to worry about a price hike in the near future.</p> <p>“We believe that we’ll be able to maintain the current level of profitability for hardware for the time being unless there are significant changes in external factors, such as a shift in tariff assumptions, or other unexpected events,” Nintendo President Shuntaro Furukawa told investors <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2025/251105_2e.pdf">in a recent Q&amp;A</a>. “While we are aware that the costs of various materials are rising, we also anticipate some areas where cost reduction may be achieved for Nintendo Switch 2 through ongoing mass production efforts.”</p>

 <p>He continued, “Therefore, currently we do not expect the recent rise in material costs to greatly impact profitability. We will continue our efforts to maintain the same level of profitability as we currently have.”</p> <p>Good news, right?</p> <p>While fans flooded Nintendo livestream chats with demands that the company lower its prices, $450 ended up being <a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-price-release-date-preorder-mk9-1851755723">squarely in the middle</a> of what experts had predicted. It was higher than the aggressively low end of $400 and under the worst-case scenario of $500. Some analysts also suspected that the price tag included a cushion to absorb some of the blow from Trump’s tariffs on countries where the console is manufactured, like Vietnam.</p>

 <p>As a result, while the PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and even the original Switch <a href="https://kotaku.com/ps5-gta-6-price-switch-2-trump-tariff-2000618881">all received unprecedented price hikes</a> earlier this year, the Switch 2 has remained consistent at its launch price. The other bit of good news is that Nintendo actually manufactured enough stock to make sure just about everyone who wanted one could get one. That’s meant zero haggling with scalpers on reseller sites like eBay and Facebook Marketplace, a refreshing change from the early days of the PS5 and Xbox Series X/S back during the pandemic.</p> <p>But I also wouldn’t expect the Switch 2 to come down in price until…well, probably ever. We never saw the original Switch get a price drop, and this one is selling even better. Nintendo has said it’s <a href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-mario-galaxy-movie-nintendo-donkey-kong-2000641323">happy to keep manufacturing that earlier console,</a> too, as long as it keeps selling, which it continues to do.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Anno 117: Pax Romana sees it battle alongside the Civilization games for city-building supremacy, and if you’re wondering what review scores Anno 117: Pax Romana will get, you should note the potential review embargo date down in your diary.</p>



<p>The Anno series is usually revered for its more complex approach to the act of building cities and empires. Its real-time mechanics force you to think and act accordingly. Dawdling can be devastating for your prospects, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/first-gameplay-of-image-of-anno-117-leaked/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Anno 117: Pax Romana</a> asks you to think faster and more fervently than ever!</p>



<p>If you’re desperate to see if Anno 117 has captured the beauty and the boldness of the Roman Empire, then read on for review embargo details.</p>



<h2 id="h-do-we-know-the-anno-117-pax-romana-review-embargo-date">Do We Know The Anno 117: Pax Romana Review Embargo Date?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Rome wasn’t built in a day; it’s quicker here. Credit to Ubisoft</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>It’s not official, but one main source has claimed that the Anno 117: Pax Romana review embargo date is November 10.</strong></p>



<p>Whereas many games are leaving it until the last minute for review dates—even as late as the day before or the day of—Anno 117: Pax Romana’s is reportedly three days beforehand.</p>



<p>The possible date comes from X user <a href="https://x.com/compusemble" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Compusemble</a>, who deals exclusively with “PC gaming and PC tech.” A quick browse through their profile shows they’ve partnered with companies before to test out games.</p>



<p>On October 10, they gave “Thanks to EA for the game code” to test out the specs and performance for Battlefield 6. </p>



<p>A November 5 message said this:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“I will be playing Anno 117: Pax Romana early thanks to Ubisoft. Will be testing the game on the 5090 and 4060. <strong>Embargo date is November 10</strong>. #ubisoftpartner”</p>
</blockquote>

Harbour wasn't around for the tour due to scheduling conflicts with the true crime thriller Evil Genius, <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/11/david-harbour-patricia-arquette-evil-genius-courteney-cox-1236608378/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">according to Deadline</a>. However, he was present during the sci-fi show's Season 5 premiere in Los Angeles. While autographing on the red carpet, a fan yelled at the New York actor that they "main [his] <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fortnite/" data-ref-id="5000-125765">Fortnite</a> skin."</p><p>"[Do] you get a grand master?"

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>It's November 7, N7 Day, a day BioWare and its community of fans celebrate the developer's sci-fi RPG series, Mass Effect. Sometimes, we get <a href="https://gameinformer.com/news/2023/11/08/new-mass-effect-5-trailer-teases-original-trilogy-andromeda-and-maybe-a-new">big updates</a>; other times, <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2022/11/07/update-bioware-teases-next-mass-effect-with-clue-filled-video-clip-for-n7-day-hidden">small teases</a> of things to come. This year, BioWare is using N7 day to announce that Amazon's Mass Effect TV adaptation will be a "brand-new story" set after the events of the original Mass Effect trilogy, meaning Commander Shepard likely won't be involved.&nbsp;</p><p>BioWare also gave a minor update on its in-development untitled Mass Effect game, which amounts to: still working on it.&nbsp;</p>

<p>"The next Mass Effect game is in development, and EA and BioWare remain committed to telling more stories in this universe," series executive producer Mike Gamble writes in the <a href="https://blog.bioware.com/2025/11/07/n7-day-2025/">N7 Day blog post</a>. "The truth is, the last few years have been an incredibly busy time at BioWare. But the team is heads-down and focused exclusively on Mass Effect. We have a lot of universe to cover, lots of features to build, and lots of romances to figure out. We're excited by what we're building, and we promise you: when we're ready, it'll be a lot of fun to show."&nbsp;</p><p>On the Amazon adaptation side of Mass Effect, Gamble writes that "the show will explore a brand-new story within the universe's timeline, and will be set after the original trilogy.

<p>Three of them, to be precise</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>You'd be forgiven for thinking that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/inazuma_eleven_victory_road">Inazuma Eleven: Victory Road</a> came out years ago. We've been hearing about this Level-5 RPG under a variety of names since way back in 2018, but now, as the <strong>13th November</strong> kick-off date draws ever closer, the game has finally scored a 'final' trailer. Three of them, in fact.</p>
<p>The above 'Final Trailer 1' (because nothing screams 'final' quite like the promise that there's a number '2' around the corner) dives deep into the game's story, with over six minutes of dramatic dialogue, plot twists, and more enunciations of the word "football" than we ever thought possible. The script leaves us feeling a little worried, it's true, but there's no denying that it's comprehensive.</p>
<p>Then we have 'Final Trailer 2' (which you'll find at the bottom of this article), which has a little more gameplay to show. This one spotlights the game's 'Chronicle' mode, which sees you travel back through series history and recruit new players to your team.</p>
<p>The trailer boasts that there will be 5,400 different characters featured, once the DLC arrives shortly after launch. Yep, <em>five thousand four hundred</em>. We assumed that it was a typo too, but it's written everywhere. Talk about "Everyone is here", eh?</p>
<p>But wait! There's more! Yes, if two 'final' trailers weren't enough, Level-5 also released a third edition titled '<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1n8XcE8HZL4">Endless Fun</a>'. This one is only available in Japanese at the time of writing, but we're sure an official translation will follow before long.</p>
<p>Whether you started following this one back in 2018 when it was called 'Inazuma Eleven: Balance of Ares", 2019 when it became 'Heroes' Great Road', 2021 when it shifted to 'Great Road of Heroes', 2022 when 'Victory Road of Heroes' first appeared, or 2023 when it finally settled on 'Victory Road', this one has been a long time coming. Let's just hope it's fun, after all that.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>During the best of times, </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-mass-effect-n7-day-armor-location-1851692131"><span>N7 Day</span></a><span> is BioWare’s annual </span><i><span>Mass Effect </span></i><span>celebration. Sometimes the studio teases what’s to come in its science fiction universe with </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/mass-effect-teaser-n7-day-andromeda-1850999958"><span>concept art or cinematic trailers</span></a><span>, but this year sounds like it’s going to be a bit quieter. If you’ve been paying attention to all the turmoil </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/mass-effect-5-bioware-dragon-age-veilguard-dlc-layoffs-1851750767"><span>at the studio in recent years</span></a><span>, that’s probably not surprising, but BioWare is assuring fans that </span><i><span>Mass Effect 5 </span></i><span>is still in development and is the studio’s primary focus.</span></p> <p><span>In a </span><a href="https://blog.bioware.com/2025/11/07/n7-day-2025/"><span>post on the studio’s blog</span></a><span>, </span><i><span>Mass Effect </span></i><span>executive producer Mike Gamble addressed fans, more or less telling them the team doesn’t have much to show this November 7. I guess that’s what happens sometimes when you make an official community day; even when you’re not in a place to show something off, you’ve gotta say something publicly.</span></p>

 <p><span>“Like you, we’ve heard the rumors lately,” Gamble writes. “You’ve made it clear you care deeply about what’s next. So let’s start by setting the record straight: the next </span><i><span>Mass Effect</span></i><span> game is in development, and EA and BioWare remain committed to telling more stories in this universe.</span></p>

 <p><span>“The truth is, the last few years have been an incredibly busy time at BioWare. But currently, the team is heads-down and focused exclusively on </span><i><span>Mass Effect</span></i><span>. We have a lot of universe to cover, lots of features to build, and lots of romances to figure out. We’re excited by what we’re building, and we promise you: when we’re ready, it’ll be a lot of fun to show. Until then, thank you for your patience because y’all are thirsty for news and I see you looking for secret meaning in my tweets (okay, sometimes they have secret meaning).”</span></p>

 <p><span>However, despite Gamble’s suggestion that the team may not have much to show off for some time, there might be some more substantial teases coming. The blog post has a bunch of random italicized letters that, when isolated, spell “url krogan.” Krogan are one of the alien species in the </span><i><span>Mass Effect </span></i><span>universe, but it’s unclear at this point what this might be teasing. No doubt fans will be working to piece things together as the day goes on.</span></p>

 <p><span>Beyond the next game, Gamble does confirm something significant about another </span><i><span>Mass Effect </span></i><span>project: the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/mass-effect-tv-show-movie-amazon-live-action-fallout-1851692186"><span>Amazon TV adaptation</span></a><span>. After rumors and speculation circulated on the internet that the show might be a retread of the original trilogy’s story, Gamble confirmed that it won’t be, </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/mass-effect-show-amazon-casting-characters-shepard-2000626536"><span>and thank god for that</span></a><span>.</span></p>

 <p><span>“The writers room is going strong, and we’ve got a lot figured out about how it fits within the </span><i><span>Mass Effect </span></i><span>canon, and where it sits in respect to the new game,” Gamble writes. “The show will explore a brand-new story within the universe’s timeline, and will be set after the original trilogy. It won’t be a retread of Commander Shepard’s story – because after all … that’s YOUR story, isn’t it?”</span></p>

 <p><i><span>Mass Effect </span></i><span>development may be ongoing, but BioWare’s pivot into a one-game studio after EA made drastic cuts to the company’s staff means that </span><i><span>Dragon Age </span></i><span>is likely in limbo. </span><i><span>The Veilguard </span></i><span>ended with a cliffhanger </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-secret-ending-executors-loghain-1851700436"><span>in its post-credits scene</span></a><span>, but </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-the-veilguard-bioware-layoffs-mass-effect-1851784416"><span>much of the talent behind that series has been scattered</span></a><span> across other EA studios or left the company entirely.</span></p> <p><strong>Update, 11/7/25, 1:10 p.m.:&nbsp;</strong>Fans have found what appears to be two hidden YouTube links in the HTML of the post.

<p>The next Mass Effect game is still in development at BioWare. </p>



<p>In a blog post on the studio’s website for N7 Day, Mass Effect executive producer Mike Gamble wanted to “set the record straight” after rumors began to circulate that the game wasn’t going to move forward. The studio says that not only is the next Mass Effect game in development, but <strong>“EA and BioWare remain committed to telling more stories in this universe.”</strong></p>



<p>Gamble says the team is “heads-down and focused exclusively on Mass Effect” after what they said was an incredibly busy last few years.</p>



<p><strong>“We have a lot of universe to cover, lots of features to build, and lots of romances to figure out,” </strong>he said. <strong>“We’re excited by what we’re building, and we promise you: when we’re ready, it’ll be a lot of fun to show. Until then, than<em>k</em>&nbsp;you for your patience because y’all are thi<em>r</em>sty for news and I see you looking for secret meaning in my tweets (okay, sometimes they have secret meaning).”</strong></p>



<p>Rumors have been circulating about the state of Mass Effect and BioWare for months after the release of Dragon Age: The Veilguard. Those rumors picked up more after the announced $55 billion sale of EA that, should it go through, would take the company private and include taking on $20 billion in debt. Even a number of current BioWare <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/bioware-staff-worried-about-studios-future/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">employees expressed concern</a> for what could happen to the studio after the sale closes. </p>



<p>When do you think BioWare will show off the next Mass Effect game, and what are your hopes for it? &nbsp;Leave your thoughts down in the comments and join the official&nbsp;<a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

<p>If you’ve played any number of RPGs, you probably know the <a href="https://gdkeys.com/keys-to-meaningful-skill-trees/">skill tree</a> as a break from the game’s core action. It’s a place to pause, take a breather, and scroll through a massive visual menu of upgrade options, considering which path of stat and ability tweaks best fits your character and your play style.</p>
<p>With <em>Skigill</em>, indie developer Achromi has taken that break-time menu and transformed it into the playing field for an intriguing <em>Vampire Survivors</em>-style roguelike. And while the Early Access game currently lacks the kind of deep content that will keep players coming back for a long time, it’s still a clever and engaging take on the genre that I haven’t been able to put down for long.</p>
<h2>Clear the way, I need +5 armor!</h2>
<p>Like <em>Vampire Survivors</em> and its many imitators, <em>Skigill</em> is all about navigating through waves of enemies that converge somewhat mindlessly on your position. The game automatically aims and deploys weapons to carve some safe space through what can be screens full of hazardous enemies, which leave behind coins as they explode in puffs of yellow smoke.</p>
<p>What sets <em>Skigill</em> apart is that skill-tree playing field, which lets you spend those coins on a wide variety of increasingly expensive stat upgrades simply by navigating yourself to the next icon-labeled dot on the branching tree under your feet. Unlike most RPGs, though, the game doesn’t pause at all while you’re picking up the next stat upgrade, meaning you have to stand still for a second or two to confirm your purchase while dozens of enemies continue to march ever closer.</p>

          
                      
                  </div>

<p>Finding that time and space can be harder than it sounds, especially late in a 10- to 15-minute run, when multilayered marching walls of enemies often clog up some crucial upgrade paths. It also means you might be forced to take an upgrade you’re not very interested in just to open up a path to more useful branches further down the line.</p>
<p>The game pauses briefly when you step over a large treasure chest icon, giving you a brief respite to choose from six different weapon upgrades. The weapon variety here is one of the game’s greatest strengths at this point, ranging from area-of-effect explosions to arcing sword slashes to targeted line-of-sight piercing arrows to slow-rolling bombs that squash enemies before exploding.</p>
<p>The damage and performance of each weapon is tied directly to different underlying skill tree stats, though, so getting the right synergistic mix of damage boosting and protective rays of force is important to staying alive. When you do get that mix going, though, it’s incredibly satisfying to tear through screens full of enemies with nigh-unstoppable automated attacks.</p>

<h2>What’s yellow and black and red all over?</h2>
<p>Aside from the skill tree playfield, <em>Skigill</em> sets itself apart with a strikingly monochrome visual style. Every enemy, weapon, and explosion in the game is rendered in a single shade of yellow, with careful black outlines to set them apart. The only occasional smears of color come in the form of those bright skill tree icons and a red outline highlighting nearby enemies that can damage you.</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>

        
        <div>
          
          
<p>The stark presentation can threaten to be overwhelming at times, especially when nearly the entire screen descends into a mass of yellow pixels. But the simplicity of the colors also makes it easy to unfocus your eyes and instinctually plan a path away from the red and yellow threats and through to the safety of the inky black void.</p>
<p><em>Skigill</em> also benefits from allowing players to speed up or slow down time with a quick tap of the shoulder buttons. This is a lifesaver for the tedium of the early parts of runs, when the enemies are coming in at a relative trickle and you don’t want to stand around waiting for the actual challenging part of the run.</p>

<p>Where <em>Skigill</em> suffers most, for the moment, is in an overall lack of variety. The recent Early Access release only has three playable characters and four skill-tree maps. While they differ in some important ways, the options fall far short of the dozens of arcane unlockable options that can keep players coming back to a game like <em>Vampire Survivors</em> for dozens of hours.</p>
<p>For replayability, <em>Skigill</em> currently relies on a difficulty system that simply scales up the quantity and health of enemies alongside a secondary skill tree that lets you purchase more permanent upgrades from the main menu. Unfortunately, even at the higher difficulty levels, you’ll see the same four yellow-on-black enemies filling your immediate vicinity, with little in the way of interesting movement or attack patterns to mix things up.</p>
<p>The developers promise on Steam that <em>Skigill</em> will see at least three new characters “along with more weapons and build possibilities” as it goes from Early Access to a Version 1.0 launch. We’re happy to hear that, because even this limited, somewhat repetitive taste of the game has had us coming back for the fun take on an old RPG staple.</p>

                <p>Today is N7 Day, which is BioWare's annual celebration of the Mass Effect series, and to mark the occasion, the developer gave an update on the next game and the TV show. Do not get too excited, though, as BioWare wants people to know it can't reveal very much.</p><p>Executive producer Michael Gamble <a href="https://blog.bioware.com/2025/11/07/n7-day-2025/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">said</a> the next entry in the Mass Effect series remains in development and that "EA and BioWare remain committed to telling more stories in this universe." Gamble also addressed the rumors of BioWare getting shut down or sold off as part of EA's $55 billion sale to an investor consortium led by Saudi Arabi.</p><p>"Like you, we've heard the rumors lately. You've made it clear you care deeply about what's next," he said.</p><p>There has been speculation that if EA's $55 billion sale goes through, the new owners <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-may-sell-bioware-and-dice-or-close-other-studios-says-analyst/1100-6535312/" data-ref-id="1100-6535312">might close or sell BioWare</a>. The studio's latest game, Dragon Age: The Veilguard, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dragon-age-the-veilguard-had-far-fewer-players-than-ea-expected/1100-6528964/" data-ref-id="1100-6528964">failed to meet EA's sales expectations</a>. It remains to be seen what the new owners might do, or how EA might look to come up with the money to pay off its $20 billion in debt for the deal, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-acknowledges-risk-of-selling-to-saudi-arabia-claims-it-will-retain-creative-control/1100-6535894/" data-ref-id="1100-6535894">this uncertainty is a business risk for EA.</a></p><p>Gamble did not address these rumors specifically but said the team at BioWare is "heads-down and focused exclusively on Mass Effect."</p><p>He added: "We have a lot of universe to cover, lots of features to build, and lots of romances to figure out. We're excited by what we're building, and we promise you: when we're ready, it'll be a lot of fun to show."</p><p>Gamble said he knows people are "thirsty for news" and thanked them for being patient until the studio can share more.</p><h2><strong>Update on Mass Effect TV show</strong></h2><p>Outside of the Mass Effect game series, Gamble gave an update on the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mass-effect-tv-shows-latest-update-reveals-a-key-detail/1100-6534272/" data-ref-id="1100-6534272">Mass Effect TV series at Amazon</a>. He said the writers room is "going strong," and the writers have already come up with "a lot" about how the show will connect to the wider Mass Effect canon and "where it sits in respect to the new game."</p><p>"The show will explore a brand-new story within the universe's timeline, and will be set after the original trilogy. It won't be a retread of Commander Shepard's story--because after all--that's YOUR story, isn’t it?" he said.</p><p>The Mass Effect show was <a href="https://deadline.com/2021/11/the-wheel-of-time-premiere-ratings-amazon-prime-video-mass-effect-lort-of-the-rings-jennifer-salke-qa-1234879517/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">first revealed back in 2021</a>, so it's been in the works for a long time already. In November 2024, the TV series <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mass-effect-tv-series-first-revealed-in-2021-is-apparently-back-on-with-a-key-update/1100-6527637/" data-ref-id="1100-6527637">got a key update</a>, when a report said the show was actually in development. The report said Daniel Casey (Fast &amp; Furious 9) is writing and executive producing the show, while Gamble is an executive producer as well.</p><p>Ari Arad (Iron Man, Uncharted, upcoming Zelda movie) is an executive producer, too. There are no plot details available as of yet for the Mass Effect show, but the main series follows the spacefaring events of Commander Shepard. A movie version of Mass Effect was planned at one point, but it <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bioware-on-why-the-mass-effect-movie-stalled-and-how-a-tv-show-might-be-better/1100-6493310/" data-ref-id="1100-6493310">never got off the ground.</a></p><p>Filming for the Mass Effect TV show <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mass-effect-tv-shows-latest-update-reveals-a-key-detail/1100-6534272/" data-ref-id="1100-6534272">could begin in 2026.</a></p><h2>"I want you to see stuff"</h2><p>In a <a href="https://x.com/GambleMike/status/1986833146873024598" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">social media post</a>, Gamble said he's aware that BioWare's N7 Day post for this year didn't actually include much meat. However, the time is not right for more disclosure about the next Mass Effect game.</p><p>"For everyone yelling at me because we didn't use N7 Day to provide a whole bunch of info… I mean, I get it. I'm a fan too. I want you to see stuff. But it's not the time…yet. Has it been years since announce? Yes. Have we been busy? Yes. Are we NOW 100% on mass effect? Also yes," he said.</p>

            <p>Bioware has released a blog post today to mark N7 day to reassure fans that the next <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mass-effect">Mass Effect</a> game is still in development, stating the team "remain committed to telling more stories in this universe".</p>
<p>Written by executive producer Mike Gamble, <a href="https://blog.bioware.com/2025/11/07/n7-day-2025/">the blog</a> shows the team's hand, revealing the team is totally focused on Mass Effect now, thanking Mess Effect lovers for their support and patience.</p>
<p>Gamble wrote: "We have a lot of universe to cover, lots of features to build, and lots of romances to figure out. We're excited by what we're building, and we promise you: when we're ready, it'll be a lot of fun to show."</p>

<p>There are no new screenshots, no trailers, no gameplay. <em>Nuthin'!</em> But, it's a sign of life from what is arguably Bioware's most popular franchise, one that comes at an especially tender time for the company as its parent company <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-privately-acquired-in-55bn-deal-by-group-of-investors-including-saudi-arabias-investment-fund-and-donald-trumps-son-in-law">EA is in the midst of a potential buyout by the Saudi Arabian Public Investment Fund and Private Equity companies</a>.</p>
<p>Gamble also teased the Mass Effect TV show in the blog, which Bioware is partnering with Amazon for. However, again, there's nothing from the production to show for now.</p>
<p>There is a fun paragraph on its progress though: "The writers room is going strong, and we've got a lot figured out about how it fits within the Mass Effect canon, and where it sits in respect to the new game. The show will explore a brand-new story within the universe's timeline, and will be set after the original trilogy. It won't be a retread of Commander Shepard's story - because after all ... that's YOUR story, isn't it?"</p><p>Gamble would conclude the blog by pointing fans to socials, as Mass Effect crossover cosmetics are coming to other EA games including <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/apex-legends">Apex Legends</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/skate-2025">Skate.</a> Finally, he promises fans there's no secret message in the blog. Still, be sure to spend hours pouring over it, why not. It's what Liara would want, I'm sure.</p>
<p>The future of Mass Effect and Bioware has been up in the air recently, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/biowares-future-under-ea-in-question-studio-veteran-warns-if-it-makes-the-kind-of-games-that-this-new-company-isnt-interested-in-making-anymore">with some studio veterans feeling Bioware is about making: "the kind of games that this new company isn't interested in making anymore"</a>. Still, there's a lot of love for Mass Effect and Bioware both, and it would be nice for the remaining team to score a major win, especially with everything else going on.</p>

		<p>Semiwork has announced that it is looking at what to bring in the next big update for R.E.P.O, and the studio wants the players to give their input on what they want. Players can leave comments on in the comments on YouTube or through the <a href="steam://openurl_external/https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fdiscord.com%2Finvite%2Frepo">R.E.P.O Discord</a> In addition, Semiwork is working on a hotfix following the<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/10/30/r-e-p-o-gets-10-new-monsters-in-its-monster-update/">&nbsp;Monster Update</a> that was released last week. One of the things that will be added in the R.E.P.O hotfix will be an Arachnophobia Mode, as well as some enemy tweaks.</p>
<p><iframe title="NEXT R.E.P.O. UPDATE?!" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JshwMkzs_MY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Semiwork has also announced that there will be a short break when it comes to R.E.P.O videos so the team can have a bit of a rest. The break will not be that long with information to come when the team has decided on what direction to go with for the next R.E.P.O update.</p>
<p>R.E.P.O stands for The Retrieve, Extract &amp; Profit Operation, where players look for valuable items from a variety of locations while trying to avoid the monsters that lurk in these areas. These valuables could be lightweight items all the way up to grand pianos, so players need to work together to get in, get the items out, and survive. R.E.P.O entered early access in February and since then has built up a large following and overwhelmingly positive reviews on Steam.</p>

		<p>Blue Dot Games has announced that following its Next Fest demo, ’83’s early access will now be releasing in 2026 and not this year as originally planned. The extra time will allow Blue Dot Games to address the issues raised by the players when playing the ’83 demo, including the UI, gunplay, and movement amongst features that will be addressed.</p>
<p><iframe title="'83 – Steam NextFest Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/t72zJNyJt_s?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>In a blog post, Blue Dot Games wrote, <em>“Following overwhelming feedback on the Steam Next Fest demo, we’ve made the decision to shift our Early Access release of ’83 out of 2025 and into early 2026. We believe in ‘83 and are committed to doing what’s best for both the project and our community.&nbsp;<wbr>We’re using this additional development time to focus on key areas the community told us matter most:&nbsp;<wbr></em></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Gunplay and feel&nbsp;<wbr></em></li>
<li><em>Optimisation and performance&nbsp;<wbr></em></li>
<li><em>Graphical fidelity and visual polish&nbsp;<wbr></em></li>
<li><em>Overhaul of the UI&nbsp;<wbr></em></li>
<li><em>Movement and animations&nbsp;<wbr></em></li>
<li><em>General stability and bug fixes&nbsp;<wbr></em></li>
</ul>
<p><em>The demo gave us a vital snapshot of how ’83 plays in the hands of a broad range of players, and we’re taking all of that data and feedback seriously. Our goal is to deliver an Early Access experience that reflects the ambition of the project, but more importantly, something you genuinely enjoy playing and want to return to. On top of the key areas listed above, we are also working hard to correct and improve our models for weapons, uniforms, gear and vehicles where the need for improvements has been identified.&nbsp;<wbr>Thank you again for your patience, enthusiasm, and for holding us to the highest standard. We’re listening, and we’ll be back with more updates as we continue building ’83.”</em></p>

<p>’83 is a 40v40 squad based first person shooter set during an alternate history where the Cold War erupted into full on conflict, with NATO and the USSR battling across Europe. Players can choose which side to play on as they battle in matches that will last 30 to 40 minutes, while players who take the Commander role will have an overview to help guide their sides.</p>

			<p>The next entry in the Mass Effect series continues to be in development, BioWare confirmed today during the annual series' celebrations.</p>



<p>In a new blog post shared on the developer's <a href="https://blog.bioware.com/2025/11/07/n7-day-2025/">official website</a> for N7 Day 2025, Executive Producer Mike Gamble provided a brief update on the game, confirming that it continues to be in development, as EA and BioWare remain committed to telling more stories in the series' universe.</p>



<p>Following some busy years at the studio, BioWare is now fully dedicated to the development of the next entry in the Mass Effect series, and is continuing to explore new features to build and figure out lots of romances.</p>



<p><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">"We’re excited by what we’re building, and we promise you: when we’re ready, it’ll be a lot of fun to show,"</em> Mike Gamble wrote, thanking players for their patience.</p>



<p>Besides providing this small update on the next entry in the series, the Mass Effect Executive Producer also provided an update on the TV show based on the series, which is i<a href="https://wccftech.com/mass-effect-tv-series-in-development-at-prime-video-with-fast-and-furious-9-writer/">n the works by Amazon Prime Video</a>. The show, which will explore a brand-new story within the <span>universe's timeline, will be set after the original trilogy, and&nbsp;<em>"a lot has been figured out"</em>&nbsp;about how it fits with the series' canon and&nbsp;</span>the timeline of the next entry in the series.</p>



<p>The <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://wccftech.com/new-mass-effect-development/">next entry in the Mass Effect series was announced on November 7, 2020</a>, but very little has been said about it over the years, as BioWare was focused on the development of projects such as <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/review/dragon-age-the-veilguard-biowares-back/">Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a>. As Mass Effect Andromeda ultimately proved to be a disappointing release for many fans in the series, <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/review/mass-effect-andromeda-pathfinder/">although it got gameplay right, in my opinion</a>, it makes sense for BioWare to take all the time it needs to make this comeback one to remember.</p>

            <p>
Blizzard are adding a new premium virtual currency to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/world-of-warcraft">World Of Warcraft</a> alongside player housing in the MMO's forthcoming Midnight expansion. It's called Hearthsteel, and is "purchased with real money using your Battle.net balance and used in turn to buy Housing items from the Battle.net shop and in-game shop," as detailed in a blog post this week. 
</p>
<p>
The post <a href="https://worldofwarcraft.blizzard.com/en-us/news/24242736">comments</a> that the "vast majority" of housing items are and will continue to be earnable through play, with a "small fraction" sold for Hearthsteel. Even then, you'll be able to buy items sold for Hearthsteel using WoW Tokens derived from in-game gold. Housing items "tied to core fantasies of a player's race or class, or that already exist in Azeroth, won't be sold in the shop", and nor will "thematically important decor that players know and love". Hearthsteel is strictly for homey boondoggles: there are "no plans to use it for the Trading Post, mounts, transmogs, or pets".
</p>
<p>
All well and good. But Blizzard's reasons for adding a new premium currency to a game that was rubbing along well enough without seem sketchy.
</p>
<p>
As the developers themselves put it in that blog post, "why bother when we already have a Battle.net balance?" They justify the introduction of Hearthsteel by noting firstly that "when dealing in transactions involving real money, a more deliberate and cautious process needs to be implemented to provide appropriate financial protections for both parties". To which I can only say: show your working, Blizzard, because I have no idea what you're referring to.
</p><p>
The developers add that buying things with real money "can be an inefficient, inconvenient, and often tedious process when a player wants to purchase multiple items", giving the example of buying a full set of chairs, candles and a dining table for a banquet. They argue that "using an in-game currency can help make the process of obtaining many of these types of inexpensive items more efficient".
</p>
<p>
I'm... not really seeing it, and neither are the Wowsers on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/1oq6li7/removed_by_moderator/">Reddit</a> (via <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/world-of-warcraft/blizzards-reason-for-adding-premium-currency-to-world-of-warcraft-after-21-years-of-doing-just-fine-without-one-has-everyone-worried-about-player-housing/">PCGamer</a>). As one user points out, why not just let players put multiple purchases into a shopping cart rather than rolling out some newfangly Azeroth doubloons?</p>
<p>It seems likely that the real rationale for Hearthsteel is the same rationale that informs purchaseable virtual currencies at large: they cloud how much you're actually spending in real money terms, and often wangle you into spending too much by flogging the virtual currency in set amounts, rather than letting you buy exactly as much as you need. The addition of housing to WOW Midnight is sure to inspire a microtransaction boom - I guess this is just Blizzard adding a little more grease to the chute.
</p>
<p>
Late last year, a consumer advocacy group <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/a-european-consumer-watchdog-wants-you-to-be-able-to-buy-exactly-as-much-in-game-currency-as-you-need-not-fixed-chunks">called upon the European parliament to end such predatory practices in videogames</a>, but a huge number of publishers rely upon virtual currencies, especially in the realm of free-to-play. Time to bang that drum again, while you agonise over the interior of your Razorwind Shore chalet.

              <p>How come<a href="https://kotaku.com/red-dead-redemption-2-the-kotaku-review-1829984369"><em> Red Dead Redemption 2</em></a> still isn’t on current-gen consoles? Why did Konami drop its lawsuit against the anime horse game? How many players will be humiliated by Ned Flanders before the <em>Simpsons Fortnite</em> season is over? It’s another edition of Morning Checkpoint, <em>Kotaku</em>‘s daily roundup of gaming news and culture. <em>Call of Duty</em> is just a week away. We’ll find out how many people still care or if they’re still too busy recovering from their<em> Battlefield 6</em> and<em> Arc Raiders</em> hangovers.</p> <h2><em>Red Dead Redemption 2</em> is now the fourth best-selling game of all time</h2> <p>That’s another big win for meticulously rendered horse testicles and proof that painstaking craftmanship can propel your game to the top of the charts even if it’s long, often boring, and essentially feels like the Ken Burns documentary of open-world action games. Take-Two confirmed in its latest earnings report that <em>Red Dead Redemption 2</em> has now sold over 79 million units, <a href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-sales-mario-kart-world-mk8-2000620694">pushing <em>Mario Kart 8</em> <em>Deluxe</em></a> into fifth place.</p>

 <p>But the game also goes on sale for just $20 a lot, whereas <em>Mario Kart 8</em> is rarely below full price. Take-Two says it’s still the top-selling game of the last seven years in the U.S. in terms of dollar sales. So, we’re getting <a href="https://kotaku.com/read-dead-redemption-2-nintendo-switch-port-rating-1850873886">that rumored Switch 2 and PS5 port</a> any day now, right? right??</p>

 <h2>Square Enix hit with mass layoffs</h2> <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-gen-ai-square-enix-qa-bugs-2000641688">The <em>Final Fantasy</em> publisher</a> has reportedly fired 140 people across its overseas publishing operations, <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/square-enix-announces-more-layoffs-as-part-of-us-and-europe-restructuring/"><em>VGC</em> reports</a>. The company says the move will save around $20 million as it continues overhauling its gaming business after years of misfires.</p>

 <h2>Ned Flanders has killed over 33,000 <em>Fortnite</em> players</h2> <p>The friendly <a href="https://kotaku.com/fortnite-simpsons-mini-season-review-changes-new-map-short-2000640868"><em>Simpsons</em> neighbor</a> is anything but when he’s roaming the map as a deadly NPC. Epic Games confirmed he’s a stone cold killer. Here’s a clip showing why you don’t want to get in a shootout by his house.</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">just checked… Ned Flanders has over 33k global eliminations in Fortnite lol 🥸 <a href="https://t.co/zxLKvdinEL">https://t.co/zxLKvdinEL</a></p> <p>— Fortnite (@Fortnite) <a href="https://twitter.com/Fortnite/status/1986600289353515475?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 7, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <h2>Friendship ended with <em>Skyrim</em> Grandma, now <em>Minecraft</em> Grandma is my best friend</h2> <p><em>Gamesradar</em> reports that a YouTuber who goes by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@GrammaCrackers" target="_blank" rel="noopener" data-analytics-id="inline-link" data-url="https://www.youtube.com/@GrammaCrackers" data-hl-processed="none" data-hawk-tracked="hawklinks" data-mrf-recirculation="[Gamesradar] Article - Inline Link" data-mrf-link="https://www.youtube.com/@GrammaCrackers">GrammaCrackers</a> is delighting fans with her <em>Minecraft</em> playthroughs in which she discovers all of the twists and turns in the old survival crafting game like it’s brand-new. Come for informal games criticism, stay for her continuously yelling “die, die, die” when the zombies come knocking.</p> <h2>The hit racehorse girl management and Konami are done fighting</h2> <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/umamusume-pretty-derby-grass-wonder-death-tribute-art-2000616912"><em>Umamusume: Pretty Derby</em></a> maker Cygames and the <em>Metal Gear</em> publisher were previously locked in a legal dispute over<!--StartFragment --><span>—</span><!--EndFragment -->what else?<!--StartFragment --><span>—</span><!--EndFragment -->video game patents. <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/konami-and-cygames-reach-settlement-in-patent-lawsuit-over-umamusume-pretty-derby/">Per <em>Automaton</em></a>, Konami was previously seeking $26 million in damages and the shutdown of <em>Umamusume</em>. No one knows what the particular patents at issue were, though there’s speculation it could have had to do with the horse game’s training system. A settlement’s now been reached. While terms weren’t disclosed, Cygames said it would “ensure that<em> Umamusume</em> fans can keep enjoying the game with peace of mind.”</p> <h2>ICYMI:</h2> <ul> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/game-awards-2025-future-class-tgas-geoff-keighley-2000641757">The Game Awards has quietly erased its rising talent program</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-mega-dimension-dlc-level-cap-100-2000641765">Pokémon fans can’t believe it’s about to break its oldest rule</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/30-year-old-mcdonalds-burger-real-quarter-pounder-fake-2000641768">Meet the oldest McDonald’s burger in the world</a></li> </ul> <h2>Watch this:</h2>
