              <p>We all rely on multiple devices to get through our days, and keeping all of them charged can get challenging. This is especially true for those who are out and about often and can’t afford to sit around waiting for one device to finish charging before plugging in the next. A multi-port, high-output charger can come in handy in these situations, and we just spotted a powerful option going for less on Amazon.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3814/">100W Baseus USB-C charger block is currently sitting at $29, after a massive 40% drop on its retail price of $49</a>. Both color options (black and white) are discounted. Even better, <strong>you can score a free USB-C cable (valued at $8)</strong> with your purchase. To claim it, click on the <em>“How to claim”</em> link next to the Get 1 free item label on the product page. In the tab that opens, add the charger to your cart, then navigate to the Benefit Item section and add the USB-C cable to your cart as well.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3814/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Three Ports to Juice Multiple Devices</h2>
<p>The charger comes with two USB-C ports and one USB-A port, so you can juice up to three devices at once. Using the single USB-C port gets you up to 100W of power, and when multiple devices are plugged in, Baseus’ BPS 3.0 smart power distribution automatically allocates the required output to each connected device.</p>



<p>Support for all major fast-charging protocols (PD 3.0, QC 3.0, and PPS) translates into efficient charging for a wide range of devices, whether it’s your smartphone, iPad, MacBook, or even Steam Deck. There’s thermal control built in, as well. Baseus Cooling Technology (BCT) monitors temperature consistently in real-time to prevent any overheating problems.</p>
<p>It’s also 43% more compact than most chargers out there, so carrying it around won’t feel heavy. The pins fold down, so you can easily throw the block in your bag or even your pocket and get going. It’s great for remote workers, travelling, plus convenient home use.</p>
<p>It’s now going for just $30, and it also lets you grab a free USB-C cable with your purchase for absolutely nothing. These deals won’t be around for long, so it’s best to get your orders in fast.</p>

<p>The popular Roblox game Grow a Garden is becoming a film from Story Kitchen. Even more so, the original developers are playing a big part in its production.</p>



<p>As part of the massively popular Roblox game, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/former-square-enix-boss-calls-roblox-grow-a-garden-somewhat-evil/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Grow a Garden</a> is an idle multiplayer farming simulator. Players would buy and plant many types of crops and see their garden grow, hence the game. Despite the simple concept, it reached insane player counts in 2025, even beating out Fortnite. There’s clearly demand for more Grow a Garden and, now, it’ll be met on the big screen.</p>



<h2 id="h-story-kitchen-developing-grow-a-garden-film-with-original-developers">Story Kitchen Developing Grow a Garden Film with Original Developers</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Image via Roblox</figcaption></figure>



<p>In an <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/11/grow-a-garden-movie-story-kitchen-in-development-1236608058/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">exclusive article from Deadline</a>, the outlet confirmed that <strong>Roblox’s Grow a Garden is being adapted into a film. </strong>The movie is being produced by Story Kitchen, a well-known name in the adaptation landscape. Furthermore, <strong>the original creators</strong> will join the project to help with its development, acting as producers. A statement from Story Kitchen co-founders Dmitri M. Johnson and Michael Lawrence Goldberg is available on Deadline, saying,</p>



<p>“<strong><em>Grow a Garden</em>&nbsp;is exactly the kind of imaginative, heartfelt world we love to adapt</strong>,” said the duo in the statement, “<strong>an uplifting story-world rooted in play, creativity, and community</strong>.”</p>



<p>Plot details and release information is not available at this time. However, a brief description of the film <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/11/grow-a-garden-movie-story-kitchen-in-development-1236608058/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">is available on Deadline</a>. The film, currently in early development, will maintain the whimsical spirit of Grow a Garden and focus on nurturing and friendship. Given the simple concept, there’s a lot of room to experiment and craft something. Story Kitchen is producing almost a dozen game adaptations like Shinobi, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-is-already-getting-a-movie-in-case-you-missed-it/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a>, Split Fiction, and Tomb Raider. Hopefully, the fruits of its labor will result in something, well, fruitful.</p>

            <p>
There is perhaps no better setting than some woods or a forest that just sucks ass. Just a confusing, scary, maybe sometimes enchanting mess of nature that is impossible to navigate. Today's latest update for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/peak">Peak</a> just so happens to present such a visage, with towering, beautiful trees, and yet again a wonderful sense of scale.
</p>
<p>
This new update is, appropriately, called Roots! I'm sure I don't need to explain to you the meaning there. Aside from the big old trees, there's also new nasties like spiders and giant beetles that will ruin your pilgrimage to the top, and, by the looks of the update's trailer, a fungal zombie infection that takes over your compatriots' bodies. Genuinely conceptually horrifying stuff for a game so cutesy. I like it!
</p>

<p>
The Roots biome comes with 11 new badges to earn too, and some biome-specific items too, like Shroomberries that have random effects, a couple of types of fungi, and some other, secret items. There's also some new items to be found across all biomes, like the rescue claw (does what it says on the tin), the checkpoint flag (does what it says on the tin), and the Book of Bones (does what it says on the tin?).
</p><p>
You'll also find that cooking has been overhauled. According to a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3527290/view/809085268448511599?l=english">Steam post</a> about the update, "a lot more non-food items will now Actually Do Something when cooked," for one. Once cooked poisonous berries will be safe to eat, whereas poisonous mushrooms won't be. And cooked "usable but non-food items such as bandages will no longer grant Extra Stamina."
</p>
<p>
There are a few bug fixes too, and apparently the divorce court has permitted Bing Bong to visit his kids on weekends, which is a strange sentence to have written as a part of my job, but hey ho, I've got bills to pay. The Roots update is available right now, so have at ye.

              <p>Last month, cosplay streamer <a href="https://kotaku.com/emiru-twitch-dan-clancy-assault-safety-investigation-2000639234">Emily “Emiru” Schunk</a> accused fellow Twitch star <a href="https://kotaku.com/mizkif-twitch-otk-allegations-apology-comeback-stream-1849944560">Matthew “Mizkif” Rinaudo</a> of sexually assaulting her. He’s now suing her and streamer <a href="https://kotaku.com/asmongold-twitch-ban-youtube-gaza-israel-hasan-piker-1851672928">Zack “Asmongold” Hoyt</a>, who covered the allegations during multiple streams, for defamation over the fallout, including loss of equity from his former media company OTK as well as management fees from associated agencies who recently cut ties with him.</p> <p>“Through the acts and omissions described below, Defendants Schunk, Hoyt, and OTK have, acting in concert, wrongfully and baselessly accused Rinaudo of serious criminal activity for no purpose other than to harm him, his reputation, and his business—and wrest from him control of the companies that he helped build,” <a href="https://www.courtlistener.com/docket/71869253/1/rinaudo-v-schunk/">the lawsuit</a>, filed in Texas District Court on November 3, reads (via <a href="https://www.kxan.com/news/top-twitch-streamer-files-defamation-lawsuit-against-fellow-streamers/">KXAN</a>).</p> <p>Emiru accused Mizkif of “psychological and domestic abuse, stalking and harassment, sexual assault, and threats of blackmail” during <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBUmFyCt3yU">an October 25 livestream</a>. “He started kissing me in my face and I let him do it,” she said, detailing the alleged assault. “I was still sobbing a lot. And then suddenly he tried to climb on top of me and aggressively shoved his hands down my pants and I screamed. And when I screamed he jumped off me, like a cat.”</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">OTK fully supports its co-owner and sister Emiru and we stand by her side and admire her strength in coming forward and sharing her story.</p> <p>While Mizkif was one of several founders of OTK, the organization terminated its relationship with him some time ago for reasons unrelated…</p> <p>— OTK (@OTKnetwork) <a href="https://twitter.com/OTKnetwork/status/1982890213031768293?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 27, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>The lawsuit accuses Asmongold of piggybacking off these claims across multiple streams, calling Mizkif “the aggressor and abuser,” and saying that he should go to jail for what he “allegedly” did. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v_na4AazJ0g">In his own stream</a> responding to the accusations, Mizkif appeared to admit he was controlling of her and said they would get in bad fights but denied the most serious allegations of misconduct.</p> <p>OTK <a href="https://x.com/OTKnetwork/status/1982890213031768293">later announced</a> that it stood by Emiru’s claims and that it previously terminated its relationship with Mizkif for unrelated reasons, while Mythic Talent Management has reportedly now dropped him for breach of contract and is demanding almost $1 million in fees. Mizkif’s lawsuit claims Emiru’s allegations led OTK to remove all equity he had left in the organization without compensation and is accusing its current (Emiru) and former (Asmongold) members of conspiring against him.</p> <p>“Schunk and Hoyt knew at the time that they published these statements that they were false,” the lawsuit reads. “On belief and information, Schunk and Hoyt knew they stood to benefit from Rinaudo’s ouster from OTK and the associated companies and coordinated the timing of their statements to maximize the injury inflicted to Plaintiffs.”</p> <p>Emiru and Asmongold have not yet publicly commented on the lawsuit. Emiru previously said she was in the process of <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/LivestreamFail/comments/1og5bn2/emiru_is_on_the_process_of_filing_a_restraining/">getting a restraining order</a>&nbsp;placed against Mizkif.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Sci-fi RTS Falling Frontier has been pushed to 2026, development studio Stutter Fox Studios has announced today. This is so the team can focus on implementing the systems properly as they head to develop a demo for Falling Frontier and hit Early Access. This is not the first delay for Final Frontier, having been delayed from 2022 to 2023, and then from 2023 to 2025.</p>
<p><iframe title="Falling Frontier - Brief Overview Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Js-opGjTlX4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>While there has been a delay for Final Frontier, Stutter Fox Studios has been working on various systems as it ventures on its journey to bring the game to the public. The first port of call is the art of Falling Frontier, where the team has developed a shared colour language for ships so players can see understand their function at a glance, while also allowing for designs that reflect the factions the ships belong to. The combat system has been changed from arcade to more of a simulation with ships being able to fire thousands of rounds each minute, and when ships break apart you can see the individual decks within them. Explosions and destruction will be physics based with the team combining &nbsp;volumetric spheres with animated sprite sheets which use motion vectors which allows for a consistent visual flow no matter if you are zoomed in close or watching battles from afar.</p>
<p>Planets have been updated so they are no longer flat textures, with each now being fully 3D worlds populated with ridges, mountains, craters and ravines, and gas planets will have mesh driven volumetric systems. Players will be able to create planets at a later phase of Early Access with the release of the Scenario Editor. In the editor, players will also be able to edit ship colours so players can change the colours of the various factions to their own preferences. There are also pirate ships in the game which can have their own unique designs as well.</p>

<p>The development team has also wrote, <em>“That covers some of the main areas that have seen progress recently. Each part of the project has been about refining what is already there rather than adding more for the sake of it, and that work will continue as we move toward Early Access. If there are areas of development you would like to hear more about, let us know. We will be taking questions from the community to help decide what we cover in future updates, alongside the milestones we reach internally. Thank you to everyone who has continued to follow the project. Your support means a great deal and helps make it possible to bring this world to life the right way.”</em></p>

            <p>
Throughout my time playing <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hollow-knight-silksong">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a>, I mostly didn't actually miss the first game's not-so-titular Knight. I do love that bug, it's just Hornet made for quite a compelling protagonist (even if I think that the game has a number of issues that go further than just it being potentially unfairly hard). I doubt this will be a universal feeling however, which is where this handy mod where you can once again play as the Knight, but in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hollow-knight-silksong-walkthrough">Silksong</a>, comes into play.
</p>
<p>
The mod, which was originally shared on Github by user <a href="https://github.com/MCXGK3/KnightInSilkSong">MCXGK3</a>, but made available on <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/hollowknightsilksong/mods/745">Nexus Mods</a> if that's your modhub of choice, does what it says on the tin frankly! The description is equally simple: "This is a Mod for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hollow-knight">Hollow Knight</a> Silksong. It allows you to control the knight in the game." What else could you possibly need to know? 
</p>
<p>
Well, it's not just an aesthetic change. The mod also brings back the Knight's entire moveset, and you can even equip it with the original game's various charms. It seems quite comprehensive honestly, just keep in mind that the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-metroidvania-games">metroidvania</a> was not designed around the Knight's playstyle, so that might act as a hindrance.
</p>
<p>
Apparently the mod does have "some things" that can prevent you from getting to Act 3, "or even completing the game," so do take that into consideration too. There's also some bugs - like, the kind that make the game run bad, not the ones you'll be befriending or killing - meaning this mod might be one you want to miss if you want a smooth experience, or if you're playing for the first time. Still sounds better than <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/stupid-sexy-hollow-knight-silksong-mods-for-hornet-horndogs-have-begun-to-hit-the-nexus-im-sorry-to-say">all those horny Hornet mods</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>So let’s say it’s a Tuesday night, you’ve got an hour-ish to kill, and you have a copy of <i>Arc Raiders</i>. In a game with menu-heavy navigation, a deep crafting system, and of course the ever-present threat of dying unexpectedly and losing all of your stuff, you might wonder just how much you can get done, especially if you’re a solo player.</p> <p>Well, friends, I decided to document just such a scenario. On a recent Tuesday night (last night, in fact), I jumped in for about an hour and fifteen minutes of my time in <i>Arc Raiders</i> to get a sense of what this game looks like when you’re not mainlining it for tens of hours straight (my first run at the full game was a virtually uninterrupted 20-hour session). Also, as I mentioned, I ran solo last night. <i>Arc Raiders</i> is perfectly solo-able, so long as you’re willing to play a bit more stealthily. So let’s jump into what you can expect in <i>Arc Raiders</i> with about an hour or so of your time.</p>

 <p>First, let’s set some expectations. I’m about 53 hours into <i>Arc Raiders</i>. I’ve built up every crafting workshop, leveling some of them up to level two, and my Raider was at level 38 when I fired the game up, so I’ve progressed up the skill trees a fair bit. This is what my skill tree looked like as of last night:</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000641438" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000641438"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000641438">© Screenshot: Embark Studios / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <h2>My first quest: Finding Rope; my first obstacle: My overflowing Stash</h2> <p>I’ve done a substantial number of quests in the game thus far. They’re all pretty much the same thing: Go somewhere, find a key location or object, flip a switch or gather a specific amount of materials, then head out. Hardly riveting subject material, but in a game this open-ended, you really just need some points to go to for random emergent opportunities to present themselves.</p>

 <p>I was tackling the “Eyes In The Sky” quest, for which I’d already completed two out of the three simple objectives: Go somewhere specific on three different maps and install LiDAR Scanners. Fortunately, those LiDAR scanners aren’t actual inventory items I need to manage. I just need to go to a spot and hold down the E key.</p>

 <p>But there was a problem: My final objective required me to build a zipline, which needs <a href="https://arcraiders.wiki/wiki/Rope">Rope</a> and for whatever friggin’ reason, I haven’t come across much Rope lately.</p> <p>I’ve also been avoiding going on Night Raids, which see any given map set at night with fewer extraction points, and the promise of better loot.</p>

 <p><b>Read More:</b> <a href="https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-tips-solo-group-recycle-free-loadout-2000641174">14 Essential Tips For Getting Started In <i>Arc Raiders</i></a></p> <p>My first impulse was to just grab the Free Loadout. As I mentioned <a href="https://kotaku.com/arc-raiders-tips-solo-group-recycle-free-loadout-2000641174">in my beginner tips</a>, the Free Loadout is a perfect way to dust yourself off from a defeat or, in my case last night, warm up a bit without the concern of losing some precious gear. But like when a loose thread on your sweater gets caught on something, <i>Arc Raiders</i> said “not so fast.”</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000641439" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000641439"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000641439">© Screenshot: Embark Studios / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>Yes, my Stash was full. This is a topic I’ve seen discussed a fair number of times over on the game’s subreddit and here and there in the official Discord. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1on8lst/psa_if_your_stash_is_always_full/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">Hoarders don’t have it easy in this game</a>. Keep in mind, I’ve expanded the storage of my Stash several times by spending the game’s non-premium currency (which you can just sell random items to earn). Still, the game wouldn’t let me go out with a Free Loadout because that would give me more items than I have space for.</p>   <p>It’s frustrating, but the game basically said “girl, use the stuff you already have!” The important takeaway is this: item management is a core part of this game and you should expect to dedicate a solid chunk of time to flipping through different menus,&nbsp; sorting and making the most of what you have.</p> <p>And so I did. After trying to clear space (I spent about five minutes trying to rummage through stuff to see what I could use or get rid of), I just rolled out with what I had which included:</p>

Is a Night Raid a little overkill for such a simple item? Maybe. But I was curious to see what would be available at night.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000641441" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000641441"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000641441">© Screenshot: Embark Studios / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>Turns out, the more minor POIs (the ones not surrounded by a yellow or red line on the map) were a little sparse. Loot or not, each area posed a challenge to my attention and awareness: I had to constantly ask myself whether a random sound I heard was a sign someone was nearby, possibly even sneaking up on me. I cautiously crawled through various buildings and eventually found my Rope. But then I ran into a tricky situation.</p>

 <h2>I just wanted Rope, now I’m running for my life</h2> <p>I took my time on the map. I was playing it safe. At night, with the world lit by sterile moonlight, it was very easy to see other people from a distance in open areas. In fact, I could see a few other Raiders far out on my perimeter. Every time I stopped to soak in the ambience, manage my loot, or observe an interesting potential sightline, however, I was reminded I was on borrowed time. Gunfire in the near distance meant I had to get moving. Fired shots means someone’s fighting to stay alive, and that’s a situation which could rope me in or result in collateral damage.</p> <p>But more than anything else, I had to get moving because I was running out of time. I’d placed the marker for the extraction point incorrectly on my map (silly me). Now I was trying to split my attention between staying out of sight and making decent time in my trip to extraction and before I knew it, I was on top of a building with just a minute-thirty left of game time (if you don’t extract in time, you die and lose everything). So I had to make a split-second decision: Do I risk jumping off the building? I wasn’t sure I’d even survive, and if I did, I might be left vulnerable to attacks from drones or other players.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000641482" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000641482"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000641482">© Gif: Embark Studios / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>I took the leap of faith, which cost me about 70 percent of my health. I patched myself up quickly and <i>raced</i> to the extraction point, calling in the elevator with 20 seconds left on the clock while an explosion went off right near me and <a href="https://arcraiders.wiki/wiki/Rocketeer">a Rocketeer</a> hovered ominously nearby. Was it going to start something with me? I wasn’t sure. The clock ran out, but luck was with me, as it seems there’s a roughly 20-30 second grace period if you’ve called in the elevator.</p>

 <p>I made it out with a bag full of supplies including my Rope.</p> <h2>Finishing the quest</h2> <figure id="attachment_2000641458" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000641458"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000641458">© Gif: Embark Studios / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>I did some more inventory management and loaded out to Buried City to finish the quest requiring the Zipline. This match included some tense battles with Arc machines and a spooky encounter with another player who wouldn’t communicate. I saw them through a slit in the wall but despite my attempts to say hi and ask them not to shoot, they were noncommunicative.</p> <p>I pushed forward on the quest, always watching my back for that other player. I didn’t know what they were up to, but if it wasn’t good, they were about to find out how good my battle rifle was. Or maybe I’d find out how much better their gun was. Who can say? That tension loomed over me for the rest of the quest.</p> <p>I did some more looting, covering my tracks with traps in case that other player turned out to be stalking me. Once again, I made it out with a sizeable bag of loot and had enough time for one more match. I was just shy of hitting a new level, so I hopped back in.</p> <h2>‘Don’t mess with me’</h2> <p>I loaded back into the same map as I had two new quests to take on. But within a few moments of deploying onto the field, some rando started firing at me.</p>

 <p>“Buddy,” I said out loud, “you don’t want to do this.” At this point I swapped out my Ferro IV for an <a href="https://arcraiders.wiki/wiki/Arpeggio">Arpeggio IV</a> (by the way, “Arpeggio” is a perfect name for a three-round burst weapon as three notes played in succession are the minimum you need to play an arpeggio on an instrument properly). It was fitted with a Muzzle Break and an improved magazine capacity. That meant my recoil was sufficiently under control and I had ammo to spare in any firefight.</p> <p>So while this fellow was assaulting me with what sounded like an underpowered gun compared to mine, I audibly said “don’t mess with me,” spun around and took them down with 10 quick pulls of the trigger. They were down but had nothing of value on them, which I’d expected.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000641462" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000641462"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000641462">© Gif: Embark Studios / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>Hey, I warned them!</p> <p>I encountered another player while scouting the locations of my quests. This person didn’t open fire on me, but they also weren’t communicative. In <i>Arc Raiders</i>, the emote wheel is sufficient enough to establish some kind of truce. “Hey,” and “Don’t Shoot” are things any player can communicate with a few button presses.</p> <p>We teamed up silently, doing a bit of basic looting. My bag was full, so I took to watching over my “friend” both because they might need the help and, well, I wanted to make sure they remained “my friend” by never taking my eyes off of them. I did, however, gift them my Burletta as I had enough in my arsenal anyway.</p>

 <p>We came across an <a href="https://arcraiders.wiki/wiki/ARC_Surveyor">Arc Surveyor</a>. These little rolly things move fast and have a lot of armor. Kill them, though, and you’re bound to get some decent loot. We chased this thing around the map for a while before I landed the killing shot. We grabbed what we found and headed for extraction.</p> <p>The extraction point was near the pharmacy, so I decided to let my comrade leave the map while I did once last pass for possible decent loot. There were four minutes left and, hey, I found <a href="https://arcraiders.wiki/wiki/Rocketeer_Driver">a Rocketeer Driver</a>! These things can’t be used for offensive attacks, but they are an important crafting ingredient I needed to expand one of my workshops. I snagged it, raced on to the extraction point and got out, hitting level 39 in the process.</p> <p>While I didn’t end up finishing my quests, I did get a good sense of where those objectives were, so I don’t have to waste too much time finding out where I need to go and what I need to gather the next time I load into the game.</p> <p>And so my hour dedicated to <i>Arc Raiders</i> on this specific evening reached its close. I was overtime, in fact, by about 15 minutes. I purchased a new skill in the Mobility Tree, did a bit more inventory management, and that was my evening.</p>

 <hr> <p>My hour with <i>Arc Raiders</i> included some tense shootouts with enemy AI, a few encounters with other players that could’ve ended any which way, a single encounter with someone trying to push their luck, and a whole lot of loot to help me go on better runs.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000641461" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000641461"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000641461">© Screenshot: Embark Studios / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>Stealth, tests of aiming, managing my time on the map, all of these are things I’ve loved in other third-person shooters, especially games like <i>The Last of Us</i> and any given <i>Metal Gear Solid</i>. But what I loved the most about this hour spent was how organic and spontaneous everything was. I now have a better sense of what loot is where, and can plan future missions accordingly. Plus, I got a better sense of how I can rely on my weaponry. I now know from experience how efficiently that Arpeggio IV works with the equipment I’d chosen to put on it. And if I die to someone and they take that gun, that gun becomes a part of their story; it could even end up being used against me. I don’t want that to happen.</p> <p>I think had I not been running solo, there might’ve been less stealth and I would’ve felt more comfortable about exploring the more dangerous areas of the map, which do promise greater loot. But either way, in an hour, I made some great progress on my weapon builds, unlocked a new ability, finished a quest, and had some interesting encounters with players and enemy AI. I’d say that’s time well spent.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Sometimes mapping every real-world struggle onto whatever the current pop culture hotness is can feel exhaustingly cynical. Often this tendency manifests in statements and gestures that are, at their best, a bumper sticker tagline about how Republicans are a bunch of Dementors from </span><i><span>Harry Potter</span></i><span>, or at worst, </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/department-homeland-security-halo-ice-pokemon-video-dhs-2000639308"><span>literal fascist propaganda dressed in </span><i><span>Halo</span></i><span>’s imagery</span></a><span>. Even just yesterday, as we headed into election night, the official </span><a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@democrats/video/7568872873331297549?lang=en"><span>social media accounts of the Democratic party</span></a><span> were using </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/kpop-demon-hunters-best-worst-songs-soundtrack-ranking-2000616633"><span>my favorite song from </span><i><span>KPop Demon Hunters</span></i></a> <span>to paint </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/donald-trump-administration-white-house-halo-gamestop-2000639566"><span>President Donald Trump</span></a><span> as an agent of the evil, soul-eating demon Gwi-ma, and it gave me the ick. So when something like </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-review-switch-2-bugs-performance-2000637719"><i><span>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</span></i></a> <span>actually seems to understand the moment in a deeper, more authentic way, it’s not only a welcome surprise, but it can be an incredibly poignant reminder that not all these stories are empty posturing.</span></p>  <p><span>In </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-review-switch-2-bugs-performance-2000637719"><span>my </span><i><span>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</span></i><span> review</span></a><span>, I mentioned a moment that made me put my controller down and just stare at the ceiling, speechless and overcome with emotion. It was, admittedly, an inopportune time for me to have to take a break, as Lumiose City, the Paris-inspired metropolis that is the setting for the entire game’s adventure, was facing an apocalyptic threat in the form of a sentient rogue machine called Ange embedded in the city’s central tower. But I just needed a moment. I’m a sentimental person, and pretty much no other series activates all those flowery feelings in me like </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>does. </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A </span></i><span>is especially well-equipped to invoke them, and its finale had its sights set on me like a Gigantamaxed Intellion aiming down its scope.</span></p>

 <p><i><span>Legends: Z-A</span></i><span>’s singular setting has been a point of contention for some </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>fans. The series is typically defined by its regional pilgrimages that take the player through different cities and biomes in search of its many magical monsters, so putting an entire 30+ hour campaign in one city was already a big change. This isn’t helped by the fact that the map is kind of small and lacks the distinct districts that usually characterize a city. So, looking at it strictly as a video game setting, Lumiose City leaves a lot to be desired. However, what it does manage to capture better than probably any other game in the franchise is that a city is not just a place, it’s a people. Landmarks and attractions can lure anyone to a place like Lumiose for a visit, but it’s the citizens who make a city what it is.</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000641435" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000641435"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000641435">© The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p><span>Because </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A </span></i><span>is set in one place, it’s better at cultivating a cast of characters than most </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>games get to be. Typically, you meet other trainers and gym leaders for a battle or two before you head out on your way to your next destination, but </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A</span></i><span>’s not-gym-leaders round out a team of absolute weirdos who would likely not interact at all in another </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>game. They come from different industries, backgrounds, and cultures, and you could imagine each of them as a figurehead of separate towns with their own eclectic visual motifs. Maybe Canari, the star streamer of Lumiose, and Jacinthe, the battle-obsessed socialite, could have passed by each other at a Kalos gala, but broadly, I can’t imagine most of these guys even being friends if it weren’t for their proximity, both geographically and to you, the player. You serve as the social glue linking a dozen or so disparate trainers that make a full-blown community by the time the game is over.</span></p>

 <p><span>Living in a dense city is pretty much living on top of people whom you might have otherwise never met. From the outside looking in, a place like Lumiose can seem like a chaotic rat race of people too distracted by their own bullshit to care about the person they see every morning on their commute. In </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A</span></i><span>, however, you see just how untrue that city stereotype is through characters like Corbeau, the leader of the Rust Syndicate, which is essentially </span><i><span>Pokémon</span></i><span>’s</span> <span>version of a French mob. He leads as an intimidating force who is seemingly extorting people like the player’s friend Taunie/Urbain, though as your team works off your debt, you’re not getting involved in heinous crimes, but instead in what is essentially forced public service, like helping the locals deal with problems in their homes or chasing off </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-society-battle-connoisseurs-jacinthe-2000637284"><span>public menaces who are bothering local kids</span></a><span>. When he finally “forgives” your debt, he does so in a roundabout way by staying at your team’s hotel base of operations and leaving a “tip” of the remaining amount. Despite his scary demeanor, the guy’s a household name in Lumiose for wanting to do right by the people.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000637236" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000637236"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000637236">© The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p><span>These kinds of on-the-ground institutions rise over the years as corporate interests creep into a city and threaten to overtake it. </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A </span></i><span>grapples with the impact of this kind of corporate involvement throughout its main story, as the city’s new urban redevelopment plan to bring Pokémon and people together via new Wild Zones that house untamed monsters is orchestrated by a corporation called Quasartico Inc.&nbsp; The company enters the city ostensibly with good intentions, but the people of Lumiose don’t seem satisfied with this arrangement, and the ongoing destabilization of the city as new Wild Zones open begins to interfere with the people’s daily lives. By the time </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A </span></i><span>wraps up its main campaign, no one’s really sure if the city is going in the right direction, and there’s something really fascinating about watching the </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>universe grapple with the world it’s made, even if it doesn’t come to a definitive conclusion by the end of the story.</span></p>

 <p><span>Even within the language of an all-ages franchise, the seedier side of city living lingers over Lumiose. </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A </span></i><span>has anti-homeless benches scattered around its city, includes a few questlines that </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-shuppet-quest-cop-police-officer-2000640501"><span>criticize the overbearing local police force</span></a><span>, and as the urban redevelopment plan unfolds, the citizens are either complaining about it or straight-up protesting it. The people are watching their city be gentrified, and they feel like they’re being pushed out by a corporation’s supposedly well-meaning changes. This is put on display by two characters, Grisham and Griselle, who were previously unnamed grunts for Team Flare in </span><i><span>Pokémon X </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Y</span></i><span>, but have stayed in the city and evaded capture, despite their actions in the 3DS games. Nowadays, they run a cafe in the city, but they secretly consider themselves members of “Team Flare Nouveau,” a new iteration of the team that wants to make Lumiose better for the people in it, and they think they’re far more equipped to do so than the suits of Quasartico because they talk to the average citizen every day when they bring them one of their specialty coffees.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000641436" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000641436"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000641436">© The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p><span>One of the most effective segments in </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A </span></i><span>occurs when these two take you to the old remnants of their base from </span><i><span>X </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Y</span></i><span>, lamenting that they’ve been ostracized from the community of Lumiose, but also have nowhere else to go because this is their home. Rather than simply rehashing the Team Flare story in </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A</span></i><span>, Game Freak chose to turn a remnant of one of its more forgettable villainous teams into a sad, moving echo of ordinary people being swayed by big promises their leaders make and fail to deliver on, typically in pursuit of their own selfish goals. Grisham and Griselle were sold a vision of a world that would help the Kalos region, and instead, all they got was a madman at its helm. So what are they to do? Make the most of it for the city they love.</span></p> <p><span>Most of the people you team up with in </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A</span></i><span>’s final hours shouldn’t be friends. In a lot of places in the </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>world, they likely would have never even met. So when the going gets tough and they band together, it shows that the heart of a city is the people who helped build it brick by brick. When it all goes to hell, these unlikely allies all gather around a giant piece of rubble to bicker and strategize how to defend their home. Everyone has something to contribute. Tarragon and his construction crew build a massive path with scaffolding to help you reach your objective, Jacinthe blocks the Rogue Pokemon attacking the city with her barrier tech, and Corbeau uses the might of the Rust Syndicate to…create a human ladder for you to climb (it’s actually a hilarious moment). Lastly, the leaders of Team Flare Nouveau defend you as you try to reach Zygarde, knowing that even if the people of Lumiose can’t forgive them for what they did all those years ago, they’ll protect the city or die trying.</span></p> <p><span>The only way that the people of Lumiose City can overcome this gargantuan threat is together, and god, it hits. It’s why I had to take a breather to just reflect. I </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/cyberpunk-2077-phantom-liberty-night-city-new-york-city-1850879791"><span>moved to New York City to write for </span><i><span>Kotaku </span></i><span>almost three years ago</span></a><span>, and as a queer man who grew up in the Bible Belt, there’s something disorienting about notions of community to me. I came from a place where most of the citizens would only rally around you if you checked specific boxes, and if you accepted that help under certain pretenses. Mutual aid often felt like it was conditional, and it often came with strings attached. I know if I asked a lot of the predominantly white, conservative people in that small town, they would say that wasn’t their experience. But many of them were so embedded in their insular circles that they didn’t recognize their hands weren’t extended equally if you were even slightly outside of their bounds.</span></p>

  <p><span>Last night, I attended my first election watch party since moving to the city, and after throwing my support behind new NYC mayor-elect Zohran Mamdani, I had been grinding my teeth all day in anticipation of the results. The event was full of so many people from different walks of life, with histories different but perhaps not too dissimilar from mine. Everyone was united in a common cause: to try and make the city more affordable for working-class people after years of escalating expenses pricing people out. In my 33 years, it was the first time I sat in a room waiting for an election result surrounded by people who all wanted the same things I did, and who did more than simply tolerate each other. When Mamdani’s victory was called, he gave an incredible speech that not only promised a future worth fighting for, but asserted that anyone who sought to disrupt that future, even Donald Trump’s fascist administration, would have to go through everyone in New York City. I was standing with my friends, many of whom had only come into my life after I’d uprooted it to be in this city, as we hooped, hollered, and cried, knowing that maybe, just maybe, things might be different tomorrow than they felt today.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>I know that </span><i><span>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</span></i><span>’s depiction of people who love their city coming together for the common good is possible because I’ve seen it. For a lot of my life, I’d felt like stories of disparate people coming together were purely idyllic or naive. But these days, I know better, because those stories are all around me.</span></p>

                <p>You spend a lot of time in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/arc-raiders/" data-ref-id="5000-546105">Arc Raiders</a> seeking out a variety of items topside to help Speranza thrive down below. One quest called Root of the Matter tasks you with visiting the Research Building to find a seed vault. If you've arrived in the building and want to know where to find the seed vault, we'll cover the bases for you in this guide.</p><p>Note that you won't need to extract to complete this quest. Because of this--and given how dangerous the Research Building and surrounding areas can be to explore--we'd recommend bringing a free loadout unless you're feeling particularly confident in your survival skills.</p><p>When you're ready to find the seed vault and wrap up Root of the Matter, follow the steps below.</p><h2>Where to find the seed vault in the room with a great view</h2><p>Your first objective in Root of the Matter is to head to the Research Building. This building is located to the right of Marano Park and is a very popular and chaotic area to explore. It's often overflowing with other raiders eager to pick fights, as well as a variety of ARC both inside and outside. Be especially aware of approaching from the Marano Park side, as there are often large ARC patrolling within the square.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4597319-arcraiders_20251104205301.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4597319" data-ratio="0.56327160493827" data-width="1944" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4597319-arcraiders_20251104205301.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4597319"></a><figcaption>Research Building</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4597319-arcraiders_20251104205301.jpg"></figure><p>When you arrive at the Research Building, search for the "room with a great view," which is on the west side of the building with a massive window overlooking the park. In here, you can find the seed vault, which is a cylindrical container against the wall. Interact with it to secure the seeds.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4597320-arcraiders_20251104205248.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4597320" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4597320-arcraiders_20251104205248.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4597320"></a><figcaption>Here's where you'll find the seed vault.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4597320-arcraiders_20251104205248.jpg"></figure><p>Now that the quest is complete, you can continue looting or fighting to your heart's content. You don't need to extract for the quest to count, but if you decide you want to get out alive (as you should), the Northern Station is nearby to the northwest of the Research Building, offering a place for a clean getaway. Just be careful heading down the steps, as the train stations in Buried City often house Pod ARCs that will explode when you get near them.

<h2>Fellowship update patch notes November 6th</h2>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Fixed an issue causing enemies to sometimes desync on their patrol paths – making them invisible to players until they suddenly appeared on top of them. This should resolve the most common situations that caused enemies to become “invisible”.<wbr></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fixed an issue where “Targeted ground abilities” would sometimes cause the aiming circle to disappear or get centered on your character when the cursor was pointing at a wall or steep slope.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<p><b>Matchmaking item level requirement adjustments</b></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Increased the minimum item level required to matchmake in Adept to 80 (was 60).<wbr></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Increased the minimum item level required to matchmake in Champion to 130 (was 120).<wbr></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Increased the minimum item level required to matchmake in Paragon to 190 (was 180).<wbr></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><b>ITEMS</b><wbr></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Fixed an issue with the [Dark Prophecy] set bonus proc so that it no longer triggers on “non-hero” actions, such as emotes and interacting with camp fires.<wbr></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The [Ancient Wardstone] relic now provides High Haste and Low Expertise.<wbr></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The [Chalice Al’Zerac’s Essence] relic now provides Spirit and Haste.<wbr></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fixed an issue where Meiko’s [Crusader Longcloak] was incorrectly named for two different items.<wbr></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fixed an issue where Vigor’s [Lamellar Helm] was incorrectly set as a pair of gloves.<wbr></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fixed various Uncommon and Rare items that had their rarity set incorrectly.<wbr></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fixed an issue where Vendor gear was always set to Common rarity. That gear now correctly reflects the league they are assigned to.<wbr></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fixed various item typos.<wbr></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><b>WEAPONS</b><wbr></p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>[Fated Strike] hit delay was reduced to 0.15 seconds (was 0.3 seconds) when used in melee range.<wbr></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The [Latent Resurgence] trait healing has been increased by 50%.<wbr></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fixed an issue where [Repository of Light] was not properly removed from other players whenever the source died.<wbr></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><b>HEROES</b><wbr></p>
<p><b><br>
Helena</b><wbr></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Helena’s health gained from Stamina was increased by 10%.<wbr></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[Hold the Line] tooltip was updated to reflect the recent hot fix, causing her Toughness to not be reduced while the absorb from [Empowered Shield Slam] is active on her.<wbr></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The absorb effect from [Empowered Shield Slam] has been renamed to “Empowered Shield Slam: Barrier” (was “Hold the Line”).<wbr></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The bleed from [Sweeping Strikes] now reduces all damage dealt by afflicted enemies by 10% for its duration.<wbr></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Meiko</b><wbr></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The [Sibling of Earth] from Meiko’s [Twin Souls: Bulwark] now has health equal to Meiko’s max health, increased by 2% for every 1% critical strike, haste, expertise, and spirit she has (was not increased by secondary stats previously).<wbr></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The [Shattering Obelisk Drape] (legendary cloak) now accumulates 10% of all damage it takes and pulses it out as damage on intervals (was 18%).<wbr></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><i>Note: The [Shattering Obelisk Drape’s] damage accumulation needed to be toned down considering the rather large increase to the [Sibling of Earth’s] health. In overall, the [Shattering Obelist Drape] is dealing more damage now, when taking all the above changes into account.</i><wbr></p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>The [Necklace of Tectonic Impact] now increases the damage of the final hit of [Earthfist Barrage] by another 75% when consuming a 2nd charge (was 50% – tooltip stated 60%).<wbr></p>

</li>
<li>
<p>Tooltip update from last hot fix. Meiko’s description for her Spirit stat has been updated to reflect that the [Spirit Armor] effect she gains upon triggering a [Spirit Refund] now grants 30% more armor (was 50%).<wbr></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Tooltip update. Meiko’s [Stone Shield] tooltip has now been updated to match the last hotfix, stating she gains 50% increased Armor for each stone that is active on her (was 35%).<wbr></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Tooltip update: Meiko’s [Earthfist Barrage] and [Lashing Stormkick] tooltips now correctly state they cause her to heal for 100% of the damage dealt (the tooltip was incorrectly displaying 150% in one place and 200% in another place).<wbr></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Sylvie</b><wbr></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The healing of [Fluttercall: Heal] has been increased by 25%.<wbr></p>
</li>

</li>

<p>The shields applied by [Safe Haven] and [Ironleaf Ward] when talented into [Natural Protector] have been increased by 200%.<wbr></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[Natural Protector’s] shield is now also applied to players that walk into [Safe Haven] after it has been placed. This only works once per player, per cast of [Safe Haven].<wbr></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><i>Note: Natural Protector as a 3 point talent was underperforming.</i><wbr></p>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>[Life Petal] now has 2 charges and gains Cooldown Acceleration from your Haste.<wbr></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[Nettlebolt] damage was increased by 70%.<wbr></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[Prickly Vines] damage was increased by 20%.<wbr></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[Sprouting Nettles] PPM was reduced to 2.0 (was 4.0) but now increases the critical strike chance of Nettlebolt by +400%.<wbr></p>

</li>
<li>
<p>Tooltip updated for [Levitate]. Movement abilities do not benefit from Cooldown Acceleration based on health. The text has been removed (the ability has not been changed).<wbr></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>[Harmonizing Refractions] (Legendary Necklace) now stacks up to 2 times to mitigate situations where 2 procs in a row would cause the first proc to be overwritten and effectively lost.<br>
<wbr></p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Tariq</b><wbr></p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>[Heavy Strike] can no longer be spammed to trigger proc effects. Now only triggers proc effects once the [Heavy Strike] starts its swing.<wbr></p>
</li>

<p>The [Bloodied Brass Necklace] legendary now deals 450% of [Face Breaker’s] damage (was 150%), dealt over 24 seconds (was 18 seconds).<wbr></p>
</li>

</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Ardeos</b><wbr></p>

<li>
<p>Fixed an issue causing the [Engulfing Flames] applied by [Pyromania] to not generate [Cinders].<wbr></p>
</li>
</ul>

		<p>Unbeatable is not going to be releasing on November 6th as planned, D-CELL Games have announced just hours before the expected release. The reason for this last moment delay of Unbeatable is the fact that the team ran into a bug that essentially makes the game unreleasable, and it needs to be fixed, which in turn pushes back dates for console certification. The new date chosen is December 9th with that date being chosen as there are fewer other releases around then.</p>
<p><iframe title="UNBEATABLE: FINAL TRAILER " width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Vkvi71znX_Q?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>In a blog post on Steam, developer RJ Lake wrote, <em>“Hi! UNBEATABLE was supposed to come out tomorrow! That’s a scary sentence. Here’s a worse one: UNBEATABLE will now release on December 9.I hate that I have to say this. There’s no way to apologize for it that feels like enough. I’m personally sorry about this and I wish it was different… the decision was only made a few hours ago. (No, really, I’m writing this right after the meeting where the decision was made).&nbsp; We are telling you this as soon as we possibly can.</em></p>
<p><em>There’s a very boring and frustrating reason; QA hit a low-repro progression blocker last night that’s serious enough it’s considered unreleasable. Fixing this would require pushing the console release date back because of cert timelines, and&nbsp;not&nbsp;fixing this is, well. We refuse to do that. We’re fixing it…We’d rather release the game all at once for everybody. Another boring reason you can figure out pretty quickly by googling the phrase “2025 game release calendar” and looking at what’s hitting this month. We had a pretty good spot on November 6 where we made a small little island for ourselves, and skipping that date necessarily means skipping forward a&nbsp;lot to find another island, and that’s the closest one we had. On the plus side, it gives us breathing room we didn’t have before to do some pre-launch things we wanted to do that had to get pushed back because of finishing the game in time for, well, tomorrow.”</em></p>

<p>In Unbeatable you play as Beat, who makes music with her band. The issue is that music is illegal in the world of Unbeatable, so Beat and the crew are on the run. The gameplay is that of a rhythm action game and completing quests while playing music. The story is said to last around 6 to 8 hours, and there will also be an arcade mode which has its own progression system, modifiers, and challenges to beat. The arcade mode will also get additional songs in the future.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nintendo-president-says-movies-and-the-like-are-%E2%80%98very-well-suited%E2%80%99-to-nintendo-games.1344994/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>As usual following <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-sold-more-10-million-units-outpacing-predecessor/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a new Nintendo quarterly report</a>, President Shuntaro Furukawa and 'Fellow' Shigeru Miyamoto (the man behind Zelda, Mario, Donkey Kong, and other Nintendo classics) <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2025/251105_2.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">answered a series of questions fielded in Japanese by investors</a>.</p>



<p>When asked about the company's growing efforts in film and visual media, Shuntaro Furukawa said that movies are 'very well-suited' to Nintendo games. </p>



<p><em>Following the success of "The Super Mario Bros. Movie," I feel that film and visual media are a form of entertainment very well-suited to our games, and we can make unique proposals in this area as Nintendo. As stated in the earlier presentation, this is a field we aim to actively pursue. Through movies and videos, we want to increase our fanbase, spark renewed interest in our games, and build multigenerational support for Nintendo.</em></p>



<p>Honestly, movies are about story and characters, and the Big N has never really managed to shine as much as Sony in these areas. That said, despite his lack of depth, Mario is still arguably the most popular game character, which paid dividends for <a href="https://wccftech.com/super-mario-bros-movie-biggest-gaming-adaptation-ever-500-million/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">2023's record-breaking The Super Mario Bros. Movie</a>. Its follow-up, The Super Mario Galaxy Movie, is slated to air in theaters <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-debuts-the-super-mario-galaxy-movie-teaser-coming-april-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on April 3, 2026</a>, but the most interesting test will be the upcoming Legend of Zelda live action film, starring Bo Bragason as Zelda and Benjamin Evan Ainsworth as Link. While still very popular among gamers, the franchise lacks the same level of mainstream recognition as Mario, and how well it can capture an audience remains to be seen.</p>



<p>Miyamoto-san had a much longer response to the same question, pointing out that this is a 'logical next step' for the game developer, and the new internal movie division is focused on experimentation.</p>



<p><em>Nintendo, as an entertainment company, has created a variety of games, IP, and characters. Thinking about entertainment experiences we can maintain long-term, film production became a logical next step. We used to focus on interactivity, but now aim to extend into more passive experiences like film. Film requires people. But we don’t want Nintendo to become a company that just balloons in headcount. Our strategy was to find partners worldwide for joint projects. Content that resonates globally can be made anywhere and speak to anyone—we are investing accordingly. Today, we talk directly and equally with diverse international production teams and creators, and Nintendo’s own developers are involved as well. On the business side, film operates under established structures. If productions are handled well, they generate profit.</em></p>



<p><em>Nintendo Pictures is less about making movies like "The Super Mario Bros. Movie," and more about experimenting with new challenges—making short films, running our own research, and tackling less commercially clear areas. Our short film "Close to you" featuring Pikmin is an example. If these pieces become valuable assets for Nintendo’s content library, we will have succeeded.</em></p>



<p>Earlier today, the Japanese game studio and console manufacturer also <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-opens-to-developer-acquisitions-as-one-of-investment-areas/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmed its goal to invest in studio acquisitions</a>.</p>

              <p>America’s most fashionable and fantastic pig, <a href="https://kotaku.com/the-muppets-were-always-adult-1724411134">Miss Piggy</a>, is finally getting what she has long deserved: Her very own feature film. It only took those in charge of <em>The Muppets</em> five decades.</p> <p><a href="https://deadline.com/2025/11/miss-piggy-movie-cole-escola-jennifer-lawrence-emma-stone-1236607843/">As spotted by <em>Deadline</em></a>, Jennifer Lawrence recently spilled the beans on a Miss Piggy movie that she and Emma Stone are producing and developing. The news was shared during an interview on Bowen Yang and Matt Rogers’ <em>Las Culturistas </em>podcast<em>.&nbsp;</em></p> <p>“I don’t know if I can announce this, but I’m just going to. Emma Stone and I are producing a Miss Piggy movie, and [Cole Escola] is writing it,” said <em>X-Men</em> and <em>Hunger Games</em> star Lawrence. The actor didn’t reveal any plot details during the interview, but when asked if she and Stone would appear in the film replied: “I think so, we have to.” Comedian and writer <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cole_Escola">Escola</a> has become a big sensation following the release of their hit Broadway play <em>Oh, Mary!&nbsp;</em></p>

 <p>Disney and The Jim Henson Company have yet to officially announce the <em>Muppets</em> spin-off movie starring Miss Piggy.</p> <p>If the movie actually happens, it would mark the character’s first solo outing since the famous pig debuted on <em>The Muppet Show</em> back in 1976. The Muppets franchise recently celebrated its 70-year anniversary. And in September, it was announced that Seth Rogen was leading the charge on a new <em>Muppet Show</em> reboot.</p> <p><a href="https://deadline.com/2025/09/the-muppet-show-disney-plus-seth-rogen-sabrina-carpenter-pilot-1236546510/">Meanwhile, <em>Deadline</em> reports</a> that Disney is working on a Sabrina Carpenter-led <em>Muppets</em> special that is set to air in 2026, just in time for the 50th anniversary of the original TV show.</p>

                <p>The cooking game Overcooked is getting adapted into a competition reality series for Netflix, according to a new report. The production company A24 has bought the rights to the game and is working with Netflix on an unscripted show, <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/11/overcooked-reality-competition-series-video-game-netflix-a24-1236608072/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Deadline reported.</a></p><p>The show is said to be similar to other Netflix competition series such as Nailed It and Floor Is Lava. "Overcooked aims to serve up high-stakes kitchen challenges and the signature chaos that made the video game a hit with fans," the report said.</p><p>The series is said to be in the "early stages" of development, with multiple developers from Ghost Town Games signed on to be executive producers.</p><p>Overcooked launched in 2016 and was a big success thanks to its local co-op gameplay where people play as chefs in a kitchen. Players must cook meals, serve them, and clean up against the clock, and the action can get heated very quickly. It's not hard to imagine the appeal as a reality TV series. </p><p>A sequel, Overcooked 2, came out in 2018, which was followed by Overcooked: All You Can Eat in 2020.</p><p>The Overcooked reality series is just the latest video game project coming to Netflix.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nothing-but-respect-for-this-manual-ear-and-nose-hair-trimmer.1344976/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I try not to be gross on this site, but if you are a man of about 30 or 40 years old you know that your body just gets weird as you age. If you have met a very old man you will see that the hair in their ear and nose area is often out of control. Generally speaking, products for grooming the nose and ear are badly made, annoyingly loud, and battery powered. The Golden Birdie by South Korean brand Royal is none of those things, which is why it is life changing to me.</p><p>Most nose and ear hair trimmers I have used have been battery powered and built like garbage. These things are usually anemic little wands that are way louder than they have any right to be and just take forever at the task of trimming your hairs. The noise is particularly an issue when it comes to your ears, because any motor noise placed directly there becomes borderline dangerous to your hearing. Your other option is plucking, and I can think of few parts of your body that are worse to pluck than your nose hair.</p><figure><figcaption>It comes with a tiny case for travel and a brush for cleaning. </figcaption></figure><p>For a long time I had assumed the solution was more technology, like a quieter motor, but it turns out the opposite was true. The Royal Golden Birdie is a spartan and analog grooming device. It can be used one handed and is meant to be placed between your thumb and index finger. The tip is two interlocking crown shaped prongs that close in on each other when pressure is exerted on both sides. The only noise it makes is a charming metallic rustling sound, like a lower registered version of a barber using shears. It comes apart easily for cleaning; you simply loosen a screw on it and pull the interior layer out to be cleaned with the included brush, which also fits in the case.</p><figure><figcaption>Royal also has a higher end model, but it requires two hands to use.</figcaption></figure><p>Royal makes several models, including a premium one where the brush is stored inside the device, but that one requires using two hands to operate the device itself. I went with the Golden Birdie, which is like five dollars more than the twelve dollar base unit, but I can’t tell what the difference is aside from the golden one claiming to be hypoallergenic. None of these devices cost more than 22 dollars, which is how much money falls out of me like Sonic The Hedgehog every time I leave my house these days.</p><figure><figcaption>Comes apart easily, simple to clean.</figcaption></figure><p>Unlike my nasty little Panasonic trimmer, the Golden Birdie just works. With 12 blades, nose and ear hairs just vanish after a handful of delightful little clicks. The Birdie is a joy to use in terms of both its exceeding simplicity and its tactile fidget toy feedback. It gives an otherwise unpleasant grooming task a mild ASMR atmosphere. The Birdie currently has about 11k largely positive reviews on Amazon, so I guess I’m not the only one who really likes this thing.</p><p>I have not put the Golden Birdie through the ringer for more than a few times, and I will concede that it might get shitty over time, but it’s an exceedingly simple device made entirely out of metal with few points of failure (like, say, a motor or battery), and even if it does fail me in the future it costs between a good sandwich and a very good sandwich to replace. That’s the joy when you find a simple solution to an age old problem – there’s just way fewer parts to screw up.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/dispatch-telltale-games-adhoc-studio"><h3>Dispatch Brings Back The Halcyon  Era Of Online Water Cooler Talk</h3></a><p>Adhoc Studio’s superhero choose-your-own-adventure feels like a fun hole-in-the-wall, word-of-mouth-recommended spot that the gaming communities haven’t had in a minute</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/mamdani-cuomo-nyc-mayor-election"><h3>Mamdani Won, And Also Cuomo Lost</h3></a><p>Mamdani can't solve all our problems, but at least he solved the problem of having to talk about Andrew Cuomo</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/i-owe-my-workday-to-criterion-24-7"><h3>I Owe My Workday To Criterion 24/7</h3></a><p>If you’re going to have cotton candy, you have to eat your vegetables too.</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/ea-saudi-arabia-creative-control-jared-kushner-donald-trump"><h3>EA Says It Will Retain Creative Control Following Saudi Sale, But, Like, Come On</h3></a><p>Big companies have shown time and time again that they'll say whatever is necessary to get mergers approved</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div><br/><br/>https://aftermath.site/manual-ear-and-nosehair-trimmer]]></content:encoded>

<p>In our Football Manager review, I wrote, <em>“Football Manager 26 is the first step of a new era, and as we’re seeing with some of the biggest clubs in the country, any new era comes with the challenge of rebuilding and both setting and meeting expectations. Football Manager 26 can get better with updates, but I doubt that this entry will be the one to make the most of the switch to the new engine, overhauled UI and new features. It might take one or two more years for this rebuild to really meet its potential.”</em></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><div><p>Last week, Nintendo surprised everybody with an announcement: Over four years after its “<a href="https://youtu.be/aZ3QC8e1_yg?si=xf6L-A2b_nt4OgDX&amp;t=699">last major free content update</a>,” <em>Animal Crossing: New Horizons</em> is getting a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/809975/animal-crossing-new-horizons-is-getting-a-big-switch-2-upgrade-in-january">Switch 2 upgrade and a free update for all players</a>. It’s not often that an incredibly popular game goes <em>years</em> between updates, but since when has anyone been able to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/22/24276650/nintendo-switch-2-predictions-playtest-alarmo">predict what Nintendo will do</a>?</p></div><p>In 2021, the company was very clear that the 2.0 update would be the game’s last. Slowly but surely, most of us stopped playing, accepting that support for <em>New Horizons</em> had ended. Well, sike, I guess! In preparation for the 3.0 update and Switch 2 Edition this January, we at <em>The Verge</em> decided to check in on our islands and see what we’ll be coming back to in a few months.</p><p>I’ll admit, I was expecting a much bigger mess. While I haven’t played <em>New Horizons</em> in ages — the villagers tell me it’s been 11 months, though it feels much longer — my kids have jumped into the island periodically during that time. And, just like in real life, they’re slobs in <em>Animal Crossing</em>. Yet our island appears mostly intact. There were a few items strewn about, and a shockingly small number of weeds, but not much else to complain about. Mostly, without me to do the gardening, the entire island is now one gigantic field of flowers. It’s beautiful and not at all what I was anticipating. Even more shocking: Both of their houses were tidy. Now if only I could get them to do that in real life. —<em>Andrew Webster</em></p><p>Returning to Isla Ashtra has been a neat exercise in forensically investigating my own brain. After being away for many years — one villager told me it was five years and four months, to be exact — there are some parts of my island where I can clearly see my thought process and other places where I have no idea what the hell I was thinking. I was pleased to see my little pizza shop and fondly remembered the process of remixing mundane items like a hat into a clever pizza display. But, as I continued to explore, I found items discarded randomly about — a crystal ball here, a mirror there — and I simply cannot intuit why they’re there. Maybe I meant to make a tarot shop, or maybe I just needed to free up some inventory space. Who knows? Certainly not me. —<em>Ash Parrish</em></p><p>My island, once populated with lovable neighbors and thoughtful placement of shrubs and amenities, is gone. It has been wiped from existence by its creator, me, in a swift act of negligence while moving data from an original Switch to a Switch 2. I guess I didn’t do something correctly. Oops. Precious erased neighbors, cover your ears for what I’m about to say. I should feel more sad, but I’m not. Maybe I’ll become engrossed in building a new island once the Switch 2 Edition update comes out in January. If I do, I will erect a memorial to you all on it that I hopefully don’t accidentally erase someday. —<em>Cameron Faulkner</em></p><p>My house is perfect, an oasis of organized calm. The kitchen is warm and inviting, espresso maker on the counter beautifully complimenting the totally-not-a-KitchenAid mixer on the sideboard. There are no clothes strewn on the hardwood parquet of my bedroom floor. Upstairs, in the office, there is nothing on my desk except my laptop and a mug of coffee. The bathroom, too, is spotless. If only I could say the same for literally any part of my real home, where my children — now ages 12 and 7 — currently sit on our stained, ratty sofa, fighting over who gets to be the lead player in <em>ACNH</em> today.</p><p>The truth is, my island house is not a home but a fly trapped in amber — a fossil, fixed and unchanging. My daughter was 6 and my son a baby when I first started playing, and back then I <a href="https://arstechnica.com/staff/2020/04/parenting-in-a-pandemic-chaos-control-and-an-animal-crossing-meltdown/">was able to exert some measure of control</a> over the island and, by extension, over anything else at all, in a world gone even madder than average. But really, the world is theirs to inherit, and to remake in their image. And they have done so, with flowers, trees, rocks, and even houses in unexpected, unfamiliar places. The part of me that has learned to make peace with the chaos is allowed to overrule the part of me that craves organization. If only they wouldn’t leave so much crap to trip on lying around on the ground everywhere — in <em>both </em>our worlds. —<em>Kate Cox</em></p><p>I played <em>New Horizons</em> every single day for two years, amounting to what my Switch Lite tells me is over 1,700 hours of time spent on my island. I collected every single item in every single colorway. I unlocked every DIY recipe and, after the 2.0 update, every cooking recipe. My storage is full of spare Nook Miles Tickets and crafting ingredients and rare seasonal items. But my island itself? It’s completely unfinished. The fish market along the southern shore gives way to a vast field of wheat (and artfully placed weeds), and then… nothing. The river lies incomplete and connected to no water source. The museum sits alone at the top of a hill I never finished building. And I’d moved all the villagers’ houses to the beach to keep them out of the way for a construction period that never ended.</p><p>I am so unbelievably excited to have a reason to complete that construction. I’ll see you all in January. —<em>Kallie Plagge</em></p><p>When I last fired up <em>New Horizons </em>three years, 11 months, and (estimating here) a couple of days ago, I had no idea all of the hoops you had to jump through in order to move your island between consoles. I left my island, LilHalcyon, thinking I could always return — even on a new Switch — once I downloaded the game again. <em>Had </em>I heard people telling each other about the importance of backing up your island online and using the Island Transfer Tool? Probably, but I didn’t take that advice to heart. This is how I wound up in a mild panic, confused as to why LilHalcyon wouldn’t load up on my Switch 2. As I sat there looking at Tom Nook in a void of darkness telling me he couldn’t find a backup on my OLED Switch either, I thought something might have gone wrong with the download process and all my villagers had been lost in the ether.</p><p>But then Kallie pointed out that I probably never moved things over from my long-uncharged OG Switch — and she was right. I was relieved to see all of my old buds still knocking around. All of the roaches and weeds were kinda gnarly, but LilHalcyon was still the charming little homestead I remembered. A couple of other villagers speculated that I was a figment of their imaginations who might have never existed in the first place. But I’ve let them all know that reports of my (and our island’s) death have been greatly exaggerated. —<em>Charles Pulliam-Moore</em></p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTYx"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Verge Staff</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games/814497/animal-crossing-new-horizons-acnh-2025-return]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/assassins-creed-shadows-sales-ubisoft-politics-culture-war-2000641428</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/report-ubisoft-details-its-battle-to-overcome-assassin%E2%80%99s-creed-shadows-%E2%80%98haters%E2%80%99.1344949/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Last year, <em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em> became a target for right-wing culture warriors ranging from <a href="https://kotaku.com/assassins-creed-shadows-woke-stop-killing-games-1851786587">random shareholders</a> <a href="https://kotaku.com/assassins-creed-shadows-yasuke-backlash-racist-elon-1851539007">to Elon Musk</a>. In a recent video shown at Paris Games Week, Ubisoft reportedly tried to take back ownership of the narrative surrounding the attacks and demonstrate a potential playbook for dealing with haters online. How much of it is just spin remains to be seen, but it’s an unusual move for a company that usually shrinks from controversy.</p> <p>The video’s existence <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/paris-video-assassins-creed-shadows">was reported by <em>Game File</em></a>, including a partial transcription of what it said and additional comments from CEO Yves Guillemot after it was shown to gaming industry members during an event at the conference. The brief presentation detailed the company’s version of events, positioning the game’s unexpected delay last year as a bold move.</p>

 <p>Instead of shying away from criticisms lobbed from certain corners of the internet that Ubisoft was “virtue signaling” by featuring the story of African samurai Yasuke, it doubled down on polishing the game and highlighting the elements that made it<em> Assassin’s Creed</em>. So the theory goes, anyway.</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Ubisoft has stopped sharing sales data with Circana who reports the software &amp; hardware sales in the us.</p> <p>First image the top selling games of 2025 as of June including AC Shadows, second image top selling games of 2025 as of July without Shadows.</p> <p>Mat from Circana confirmed this <a href="https://t.co/4WuKoSgRhP">pic.twitter.com/4WuKoSgRhP</a></p> <p>— JorRaptor (@Jorraptor) <a href="https://twitter.com/Jorraptor/status/1960794645308252467?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 27, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>“With our allies beside us, we found confidence again: To stand tall, to take risks, to speak up, even against the loudest haters,” the narrator of the marketing video says, according to <em>Game File</em>. “And by the time<em> Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em> launched, thanks to our fans, momentum was finally on our side.”</p>

 <p>Guillemot elaborated on the pivot in a conversation afterwards. “We were initially surprised by the extent of the attacks,” he said, according to <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/paris-video-assassins-creed-shadows"><em>Game File</em>‘s translation</a>. “And we quickly realized that it was a battle, a battle with our fans, to demonstrate that we were, in fact, more of a video game than a message.”</p>

 <h2><em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em>‘ sales figures are in stealth mode</h2> <p>It’s an echo of something the cofounder said shortly after announcing the game’s delay. “I want to reaffirm that we are an entertainment-first company, creating games for the broadest possible audience, and our goal is not to push any specific agenda,” he told investors last year in an apparent attempt to beat the allegations of the company’s worst critics. <a href="https://kotaku.com/assassins-creed-game-cancel-reconstruction-black-slave-2000633318"><em>Game File</em> also reported</a> that the company canceled an <em>Assassin’s Creed</em> set in post-Civil War America over concerns about political unrest.</p>

 <p>Ubisoft did hit back at critics earlier this year. The official <em>Assassin’s Creed</em> account <a href="https://x.com/assassinscreed/status/1897048261619540235">dunked on one of the most high-profile social media accounts</a> leading a campaign against the game. But developers working on the game were <a href="https://kotaku.com/assassins-creed-shadows-antiwoke-ubisoft-rpg-1851770511">reportedly also advised</a> not to post about <em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em>‘ release to avoid becoming a target of the harassment campaign.</p> <p>How has this all worked out for Ubisoft? It’s hard to tell. <em>Shadows</em> was well reviewed at launch and sold well in its first few months. It was the third top-grossing game in the U.S. as of June, but Ubisoft has stopped sharing public sales data in the months since and hasn’t officially confirmed <a href="https://twitter.com/Jorraptor/status/1960794645308252467?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1960794645308252467%7Ctwgr%5Edbaadbf897184f93beb9cf56c0dee354ed10b92a%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fkotaku.com%2Fwp%2Fwp-admin%2Fpost-new.php">exact sales figures</a>. It must have been happy enough with the results to move ahead with other delays. Ubisoft told investors earlier this year that a slate of unannounced upcoming blockbusters <a href="https://kotaku.com/far-cry-7-assassins-creed-hexe-ghost-recon-delay-1851780674">would take longer than expected to ship</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>In a shocking move, D-CELL GAMES’ Unbeatable has been delayed to early December, with less than 12 hours until its planned launch. As to why the last-minute delay happened, it seems an unreleaseable bug was found and needs to be fixed urgently.</p>



<p>Announced via Kickstarter in 2021, Unbeatable is an anime-inspired rhythm game releasing on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S. As vocalist Beat, you’ll resist a tyrannical government that outlawed music. With the help of your band, you’ll bring music back to the world via engaging rhythm gameplay. A <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2240620/UNBEATABLE/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">demo for the game</a> was released on PC and PlayStation 5 and was well-received by fans. The game was originally set to release on November 6th, but according to the developer, it won’t launch until December.</p>



<h2 id="h-indie-rhythm-game-unbeatable-gets-last-minute-delay-to-december-9th-2025">Indie Rhythm Game Unbeatable Gets Last-Minute Delay to December 9th, 2025</h2>

</p></figure>



<p>In <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2240620/UNBEATABLE/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a developer post on Steam</a>, RJ Lake, one of the game’s directors, announced that <strong>Unbeatable is now coming out on December 9th</strong>, <strong>2025</strong>. The game was <strong>expected to launch in less than 12 hours</strong>, so the delay is very last-minute. As to why, the team cites a <strong>low-repro progression blocker</strong> that would require pushing the console release date back if fixed. To that end, to ensure the game releases on all platforms simultaneously, it has been pushed to December.</p>



<p>Delays for games are a rare occurrence, much <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/borderlands-4-nintendo-switch-2-delayed-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">less at the last minute</a>. Given the popularity of Unbeatable, it’s sure to be disappointing. However, D-CELL GAMES does mention that, with the extra time, it’ll be able to work on some pre-launch content it couldn’t get to. So, while it’ll be a month before we get to play it, the version we’ll get will hopefully be the best possible one.</p>



<p>What do you think of Unbeatable’s last-minute delay? Are you disappointed? Did you play the demo? If so, did you enjoy it?

It can be a lot of fun to track things down on your own, but it can also prove challenging at times. If you're struggling to find Major Aiva's Patch for the Echoes of Victory Ridge quest, we'll help you along with things.</p><p>Note that you need to extract from the topside with Major Aiva's Patch once you obtain it. With this in mind, it's a good idea to bring along an augment with a safe pocket so that you can ensure you don't lose your quest item even if you fall in battle.</p><p>When you're ready to get started, read on for where to find Major Aiva's Patch in Arc Raiders.</p><h2>Where to find Major Aiva's Patch for the Echoes of Victory Ridge quest</h2><p>Your first objective for Echoes of Victory Ridge will be to actually find Victory Ridge, which is located in the northern portion of the Dam Battlegrounds map. Zoom in and seek the West Broken Bridge POI--that's where you're headed. Note that this is a mostly safe area in the majority of matches, but you never know if you might run into other questers, so keep an eye out and try to be friendly. Or shoot them on site--it's your call.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4597275-arcraiders_20251104195529.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4597275" data-ratio="0.55354993983153" data-width="1662" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4597275-arcraiders_20251104195529.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4597275"></a><figcaption>West Broken Bridge</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4597275-arcraiders_20251104195529.jpg"></figure><p>When you arrive at the circled area above, you'll need to look for a small box containing Major Aiva's Patch. This can be hard to spot if you don't know where to search. Look around for part of the fallen road that can be crawled under--more easily spotted if standing on the northern end of the POI and looking south. Under the right side of this crumbled road is the box with Major Aiva's Patch inside.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4597277-arcraiders_20251104195548.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4597277" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4597277-arcraiders_20251104195548.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4597277"></a><figcaption>Major Aiva's Patch location</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4597277-arcraiders_20251104195548.jpg"></figure><p>Place Major Aiva's Patch in your safe pocket if you came equipped with one, then head east to the North Complex Elevator to extract. There are often a lot of ARC patrolling here, so retreat to safety after calling the elevator if you get their attention and can't fight your way out of it. Hopefully, you'll get back to Speranza and turn this quest in so you can move along to the next one.</p><p>For more, check out our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/all-arc-raiders-quests-full-mission-list/1100-6535922/" data-ref-id="1100-6535922">full Arc Raiders quest list</a>.</p>

Some of the companies that Nintendo has acquired in the past 10 years have included Shiver, Dynamo Pictures, SRD, and Next Level Games.</p><p>Beyond buying companies outright, Nintendo said it will use some of its money to fund internal development and expansion, including through the construction of a second building at its corporate headquarters in Japan.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

		<ul>
			<li>0-20%: Unlikely - Lacks credible sources</li>
			<li>21-40%: Questionable - Some concerns remain</li>
			<li>41-60%: Plausible - Reasonable evidence</li>
			<li>61-80%: Probable - Strong evidence</li>
			<li>81-100%: Highly Likely - Multiple reliable sources</li>
		</ul>
	</div>


			
			
			
			<p>According to a new report from <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/11/overcooked-reality-competition-series-video-game-netflix-a24-1236608072/">Deadline</a>, Netflix is once again looking at making a TV series adapted from a video game, but it's not something like its <a href="https://wccftech.com/netflix-the-witcher-season-4-liam-hemsworth/">adaptation of The Witcher</a> or its <a href="https://wccftech.com/splinter-cell-deathwatch-premiere-netflix-ubisoft/">new Splinter Cell animated series.</a> Alongside A24, Netflix is reportedly making a reality TV cooking competition, based on the beloved indie co-op cooking game, Overcooked.</p>



<p>The report describes it as a show that'll follow a similar path to Netflix's other viral cooking shows like 'Nailed It!' and 'Floor is Lava.' Phil Duncan, Oli De-Vine, and Gemma Langford from Ghost Town Games, the studio behind Overcooked, are reportedly working on the adaptation as executive producers.</p>



<p>Both Netflix and A24 declined to comment on the report, so for now, we only have Deadline's report to go off of. While Deadline has the kind of track record where we can safely assume that this will be confirmed soon, nothing's impossible, and it could be the case that this project, if it is in development, never makes it across the finish line.</p>



<p>If that were to happen, though, what a disappointment that would be, because there is no game better suited to be adapted in this way. Of course, some of the shenanigans that players get up to in Overcooked are too fantastical to be feasible in the real world, but it would be an undeniably entertaining show if chefs had to toss ingredients to each other, jump over gaps to get to different stations, and cook with the kinds of insane limitations and obstacles players face in Overcooked.</p>



<p>Hopefully, this is not a project that ends up in the trash.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Today, Blizzard announced that tickets for BlizzCon 2026 will go on sale on Friday, November 7, 2025, at 9 AM Pacific Time through Sunday, November 9, at midnight Pacific Time. These will be 'Early Bird' tickets available for $249.99 (a price that includes all taxes and fees) while supplies last. The organizers also confirmed that the maximum number of purchasable passes per account has been increased from two to four.</p>



<p>The second wave of tickets will go on sale starting Tuesday, November 18, 2025, at 9 AM Pacific Time, for $289.99. A ticket grants two-day weekend admission to BlizzCon 2026 on both Saturday and Sunday, including access to all Halls and Arena, during show hours. Moreover, fans will also obtain some in-game goodies (currently unspecified) and exclusive items to commemorate the event. Tickets will go on sale <a href="https://www.tixr.com/groups/bc/events/blizzcon-2026-159916" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">via Tixr</a> and you'll need an account to buy them.</p>



<p>As usual, the main event will be the Opening Ceremony, where Blizzard holds the biggest announcements and reveals. The Opening Ceremony will take place on the Main Stage in Hall D, with seats available on a first-come, first-served basis. In this case, we might see the launch news of the next Diablo IV expansion, <a href="https://wccftech.com/diablo-ivs-2025-roadmap-unveiled-new-expansion-in-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">due to be released at some point in 2026</a>. World of Warcraft: Midnight, on the other hand, is <a href="https://wccftech.com/world-of-warcraft-midnight-to-launch-february-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rumored to be scheduled to launch in February</a>. That said, there will undoubtedly be news about updates for World of Warcraft, Overwatch 2, Hearthstone, and Diablo Immortal throughout the event, especially in the dedicated developer panels.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>As Blizzard <a href="https://wccftech.com/blizzcon-makes-a-return-in-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">had confirmed earlier this year</a>, BlizzCon 2026 will take place at the usual venue, the Anaheim Convention Center, on September 12 and 13. The fan-focused convention returns after a three-year hiatus; the last BlizzCon took place on November 3 and 4, 2023, and the big announcement was the <a href="https://wccftech.com/world-of-warcraft-worldsoul-saga-the-war-within-midnight-the-last-titan-expansions/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Worldsoul Saga</a>, a trilogy of World of Warcraft expansions (The War Within, Midnight, and The Last Titan) featuring a continuous storyline written by returning writer guru Chris Metzen.</p>

The platform has officially partnered with Darrington Press, offering users to print miniatures based on the various ancestries found in the fantasy TTRPG, <em>Daggerheart</em>.</p>

<h2>The Hero Forge Collaborator Collections Announcement</h2>

<p>In an official <a href="https://www.heroforge.com/content/product-information/about-products/daggerheart/" rel="nofollow">blog post</a>, Hero Forge breaks down what will be featured in the Daggerheart Collaborator Collections. The collection will bring three specific ancestries onto the platform: Simian, Fungril, and Ribbet.</p>

Ribbets have their own outfits, adventuring gear, and weapons. Fungril have different mushroom caps and pauldrons to make each one feel unique. Simians have three subtypes supported: Monkey, Orangutan, and Tamarin, respectively.</p>

<p>This granularity is important since the core appeal of Hero Forge is being able to make customizable miniatures for your TTRPG home games. But up until now, the platform mostly stuck to broad fantasy options, allowing the miniatures to be used in anything from <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/dungeons-dragons" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em></a> to <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/games/pathfinder" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Pathfinder</em></a> and everything between.</p>

<p>Now with this Collaborator Collections announcement, the platform is leaning into more direct partnerships. Given how much <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/daggerheart-review-narrative-forward-yes-and-ttrpg-that-is-force-to-be-reckoned" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Daggerheart</em></a> has caught on in the tabletop community, this partnership is just another feather in Darrington Press' cap.</p>

<p>The downside is that it is not free. Up to this point, the miniature creation platform on Hero Forge was free to all users. You only paid if you wanted the miniature physically printed. Now, if you want to access official <em>Daggerheart</em> ancestries, you will need to pay $7.99 for each ancestry individually. That's $21.99 for full access, on top of the usual printing fees.</p>

<p>In this context, the launch of Hero Forge Collaborator Collections may be the start of the platform adopting a more aggressive microtransaction model for future options down the road.</p>

That’s because there still aren’t many controllers that can mimic one of the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/684602/nintendo-switch-2-pro-controller-review">$89.99 Switch 2 Pro</a>’s biggest selling points, which is letting owners turn the console on from their couch. It’s still something to brag about, and yet notable accessory company 8BitDo doesn’t seem keen to boast that it recently debuted new firmware for its <a href="https://www.theverge.com/reviews/755307/8bitdo-pro-3-controller-review-pc-nintendo-switch-2">Pro 3</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/619229/8bitdo-ultimate-2-wireless-controller-tmr-anti-drift-joysticks">Ultimate 2</a> that enables this handy trick.</p><p>Version 2.0 of its firmware for both controllers (available now in its <a href="https://app.8bitdo.com/Ultimate-Software-V2/">Ultimate Software V2</a> on Windows and Mac) brings shake-to-wake support on Switch 2. Once either controller is paired with this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kLT-fUVxsBU">goofy one-time procedure</a>, you can simply turn on your gamepad, give it a little shake, then your console will wake up. I’ve confirmed that it works on my Switch 2 with both controllers.</p><p>The lack of Switch 2 wake-up in 8BitDo’s latest controllers was one of the reasons why I’ve been suggesting other models to <em>Verge </em>readers. At around $69.99 each, these aren’t cheap. And yet, models that are considerably less expensive (like GuliKit’s $29.99 ES Pro and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/791574/best-switch-2-controllers">other solid controllers</a>) shipped months ago with the ability to wirelessly wake the Switch 2.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTU2Ng=="><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Cameron Faulkner</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div><form><div><h2>The Verge Daily</h2><p><span>A free daily digest of the news that matters most.</span></p></div></form></div></div></article></div></main></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/814551/8bitdos-latest-wireless-controllers-can-now-shake-to-wake-the-switch-2]]></content:encoded>
