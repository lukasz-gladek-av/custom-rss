            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/tamashii-chronicles-of-ascend-review-uniquely-neon<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Straight off the bat,&nbsp;<em>Tamashii Chronicles of Ascend</em> looks <em>Cyberpunk</em>. The box, the artwork and the components on opening it scream like something out of a dystopian future full of rogue machines and evil corporations. But does this scenario-drive board game feel <em>Cyberpunk</em>? In our review, we'll talk about how some of the mechanics work, and how it feels to play.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/tamashii-chronicle-of-ascend-5.jpg?itok=0mwLJrVh 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/tamashii-chronicle-of-ascend-5.jpg?itok=XuswDyTN 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>&nbsp;A part of the game in&nbsp;<em>Tamashii Chronicles of Ascend</em> is played on a hex map (Photo Credit: Awaken Realms).</figcaption></figure><h2>How Do You Play Tamashii Chronicles of Ascend?</h2>

<p>In&nbsp;<em>Tamashii, </em>players represent a group of rebel allies battling against an omnipresent AI. Players have a unique ability to jump into the bodies of others, seeking out and selecting those that are best pace to achieve what they need to.</p>

<p>The first thing you need to do when you start playing <em>Tamashii</em> is to choose a scenario, of which the core box includes 11 (including the prologue and finale). After the prologue, you can play the scenarios in any order, but you can only play the finale once you've gotten certain results on the scenario progress sheet.</p>

<p>In each&nbsp;<em>Tamashii </em>scenario, games&nbsp;are split between 2 key areas. The first is a map made up of hex tiles that represent the areas you will interact with. It works extremely well as a visual representation of how your character interacts with the world. Each tile isn't an area in a building, or even a necessarily linked building or street, but simply areas that your consciousness moves through as you progress. Each map tile offers a reward for being there, but each turn you remain there increases the trace value making it more likely you'll be found, and enemies stronger when they do.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/tamashii-chronicle-of-ascend-4.jpg?itok=1zOpzC8Q 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/tamashii-chronicle-of-ascend-4.jpg?itok=o_N21miQ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The major part of&nbsp;<em>Tamashii Chronicles of Ascend </em>gameplay takes part on the player's dashboards.</figcaption></figure><p>The second area of the game, and the core part, is on the dashboard that sits in front of you. This dashboard has a slot for the current body you inhabit, along with slots for upgrades, the trace track, which details how strong enemies are when they find you, and a place for enemy cards, because they attach to you, and not your character on the map. They also stack and build up on each other.</p>

<p>The final part of the dashboard, and the key part in the center, is the launcher, where you have different colored tokens. The arrangement of these tokens can unlock abilities and allow you to use basic actions along with giving access to the bodies that you can inhabit.</p>

<p>The game takes place over 4 phases, the planning phase, where you can move the tokens around on your dashboard in order to create the required patterns, the action phase, where you move and launch the actions from your dashboard, then combat and then the quest phase.</p>

<p>The rulebook doesn't do a great job of taking you through the game, but honestly, once you've played a game or 2, it all fits together nicely, and you'll enjoy the scenarios immensely, you just need to persevere when learning the rules.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/tamashii-chronicle-of-ascend-3.jpg?itok=SoLMkGwW 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/tamashii-chronicle-of-ascend-3.jpg?itok=I5sdSTAg 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Tamashii Chronicles of Ascend </em>initially has 8 bodies for you to inhabit during games.</figcaption></figure><h2>Does Tamashii Chronicles of Ascend Have Different Characters?</h2>

<p>The only characters you can play in <em>Tamashii </em>are those of the bodies you inhabit. There are 8 available initially, plus those built into your dashboard, each with their own pattern cost to inhabit and their own abilities and powers. The first bodies available are:</p>

<ul><li>Assassin</li>
	<li>Knight</li>
	<li>Rogue</li>
	<li>Scout</li>
	<li>Hacker</li>
	<li>Slasher</li>
	<li>Quaminator</li>
	<li>Visionary</li>
</ul><figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/tamashii-chronicle-of-ascend-2.jpg?itok=1bo6Tjp6 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/tamashii-chronicle-of-ascend-2.jpg?itok=A374Sr4P 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The scenarios are what drives&nbsp;<em>Tamashii Chronicles of Ascend </em>and each can be played in whichever order you like, or repeatedly to get different results.</figcaption></figure><h2>Can You Hack In Tamashii Chronicles of Ascend?</h2>

<p>You don't hack as such in <em>Tamashii</em>, but the whole experience combines to create an extremely thematic <em>Cyberpunk</em> vibe. It all feels weirdly disembodied, the enemies attaching to you, the focus on the patterns and launching programs (which can defeat enemies without even going into combat), and the interaction with the world through the map, as well as the different bodies you can inhabit. I was honestly pretty skeptical about it at first, but it's captured the <em>Cyberpunk</em> theme better than any board game I've played previously, and aside from the original <em>Netrunner</em> card game, gives an extremely pleasing mechanics experience for hacking and jacking into bodies.</p>

<h2>What Are Our Final Thoughts On Tamashii Chronicles of Ascend?</h2>

<p><em>Tamashii </em>is an incredible <em>Cyberpunk</em> experience, once you get into it. The rulebook feels like hard work, but once you know what you're doing, it all feels incredibly thematic and satisfying. I'm usually slating games for their skin-deep theme, but&nbsp;<em>Tamashii </em>has really captured it, between the two areas of the game, and the scenarios themselves, it's a rich environment that feels completely attuned to the mechanics it uses. It's a rewarding experience overall.</p>

<h2>Should I Buy Tamashii Chronicles of Ascend?</h2>

<p>If you love all that is&nbsp;<em>Cyberpunk</em>, then&nbsp;<em>Tamashii Chronicles of Ascend </em>is for you. You will love the look and the rich theme that the mechanics capture throughout. If <em>Cyberpunk</em> isn't your thing, then&nbsp;<em>Tamashii </em>loses some of its flair, as its real focus is on the scenarios that might not carry through on just the mechanics alone.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-update-adds-splitscreen-play-to-all-stages-and-more.1059069/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-update-splitscreen<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Bandai Namco has released a new&nbsp;<em>Dragon Ball: Sparking! Zero&nbsp;</em>update that adds the ability to play splitscreen across all of the game's stages, as well as new gameplay adjustments and more.</p>

<p>As the update's patch notes reveal, offline splitscreen matches can now be held in any of&nbsp;<em>Dragon Ball: Sparking! Zero</em>'s twelve stages. Previously, splitscreen play was limited to the Hyperbolic Time Chamber stage, but that limitation has officially been removed.</p>

<p>Back in June, Bandai Namco said it would be "difficult" to implement local splitscreen play while retaining&nbsp;<em>Sparking! Zero</em>'s "core elements" of busy effects and terrain destruction, which is likely why splitscreen was previously limited to the largely-empty Hyperbolic Time Chamber.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-update-splitscreen-frieza.jpg?itok=OhDRUS0k 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-update-splitscreen-frieza.jpg?itok=PTdv00ez 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Dragon Ball: Sparking! Zero&nbsp;</em>now lets you play splitscreen on any stage.</figcaption></figure><p>However, now, thanks to this latest update's rather nebulous assertion that the devs have "improved performance and ease of use", it's possible to enjoy splitscreen play across any number of&nbsp;<em>Sparking! Zero</em>'s levels.</p>

<p>Of course, this isn't the only improvement the update brings. You can also expect a number of quality-of-life improvements and gameplay adjustments, including the ability to skip battle animations during online matches, as well as a new High-Speed Dragon Dash move that lets you close distance to your opponent.</p>

<p>If you're interested, you can read the full patch notes for this&nbsp;<em>Dragon Ball: Sparking! Zero&nbsp;</em>update <a href="https://www.bandainamcoent.asia/sea/news/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-free-update-1112" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">right here</a>. I'd say it's almost certainly worth doing so if you're planning to jump into online play anytime soon.</p>




<p><em>Dragon Ball: Sparking! Zero&nbsp;</em>is the latest installment in the&nbsp;<em>Budokai Tenkaichi&nbsp;</em>sub-series of&nbsp;<em>Dragon Ball&nbsp;</em>fighting games, and the first game in the series since 2007's&nbsp;<em>Budokai Tenkaichi 3</em>. Unlike previous games, it bears the series' original Japanese name of&nbsp;<em>Sparking!&nbsp;</em>in the West as well.</p>

<p>Placing an emphasis on lore-accurate power levels and movesets instead of pure competitive balance,&nbsp;<em>Sparking! Zero&nbsp;</em>became the&nbsp;<em>Dragon Ball&nbsp;</em>series' <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-series-best-steam-debut" rel="nofollow">highest-charting Steam debut</a> when it launched in October, going on to sell <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-sales-3m" rel="nofollow">three million copies in a single day</a>.</p>

To accompany this news, the <em>Pocket</em> devs have revealed a rather big surprise: there’s to be a new special set of Mew-themed packs called Mythical Island, arriving in the game on December 17.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196165" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="What’s Coming Out Beyond Pokémon: The Indigo Disk | The Week In Games" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="95" data-playlist="196165,196663,197298" data-current="196165"><div><p>What’s Coming Out Beyond Pokémon: The Indigo Disk | The Week In Games</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196165/196165_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196165/196165_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196165/196165_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196165/196165_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21711.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>It was widely expected that a new set would join (rather than replace, given the game’s so-far redundant “Select Expansion” page) the launch set, Genetic Apex, at the end of January, as this would follow the three-monthly cycle of the real-world version of the TCG. But I don’t think anyone was expecting a new “Themed Booster Pack” set before the end of the year. That’s the designation given to Mythical Island, which—and I’m speculating somewhat here with ambiguous information—appears to be a smaller “special set” (it’s coded “A1a”, to Genetic Apex’s “A1”), with just Mew pack art, that’ll throw some excellent spanners into the current meta.</p><p><em>Pocket</em> has so far featured just Genetic Apex, the unfortunately named set (everyone else sees it as the codename for a <em>Wolfenstein</em>-style enemy project, right?) that has featured Pikachu, Charizard and Mewtwo. While collecting the entire set <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-hidden-cards-odds-wonder-pick-1851689974&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-hidden-cards-odds-wonder-pick-1851689974">would take you over a year</a></span> without paying astonishing amounts of money, it’s been around long enough now that most people have the cards to <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-best-decks-mewtwo-charizard-1851696181&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-best-decks-mewtwo-charizard-1851696181">build the decks that are dominating the meta</a></span>. In fact, if you take part in the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-emblem-event-sp-1851716406&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-emblem-event-sp-1851716406">fun new Emblem Event</a></span>, you’ll almost inevitably face either the Mewtwo, Charizard, Blastoise or Pikachu decks, almost without variation. So what the game really needs is a bunch of new cards thrown in to explode all that.</p><p>So hooray for news of Mythical Island in less than a week. The trailer flashes a whole bunch of new cards, including of course a Mew ex, which has a single energy 20 damage attack, but then a very Ditto-like ability for three energy (and energy of <em>any</em> type, making this a strong addition to any deck) called Genome Hacking. This lets you “choose 1 of your opponent’s Active Pokémon’s attacks and use it as this attack.”</p><p>However, I think the real game-changer is going to be an Aerodactyl ex that has an Ability to prevent your opponent from evolving their Active Pokémon. Given how much of the meta is based around such a move, this should shake things up! Better get used to evolving on the bench.</p><figure id="" data-id="4076bda49ed705f824db09785f24ab03" data-recommend-id="image://4076bda49ed705f824db09785f24ab03" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A series of Pokémon cards from the Mythical Island set." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A series of Pokémon cards from the Mythical Island set." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="4076bda49ed705f824db09785f24ab03" data-recommend-id="image://4076bda49ed705f824db09785f24ab03" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A series of Pokémon cards from the Mythical Island set." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Also briefly glimpsed is a Vaporeon special art with a new Ability to transfer water energy between cards, and gorgeous special arts for Dedenne and Marshadow.</p><p>There are new Trainers, too, including Blue, who will reduce all incoming damage for a turn by 10 points, and Leaf who’ll really mess everything up by reducing retreat costs on your Active Pokémon by <em>two</em>. X Speed, step aside.</p><p>It’s hard to know if the set is very tiny, and just has the two ex cards and the two new Trainers, or if the trailer is being very selective in what it shows—infuriatingly, these <em>Pocket</em> cards don’t have the traditional numbering that shows you a set’s size.

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/gundam-card-game-first-hands-on-ready-to-engage-pilot</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/gundam-card-game-first-hands-on-ready-to-engage-pilot.1059051/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/gundam-card-game-first-hands-on-ready-to-engage-pilot<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">With the surge of popularity among anime card games like One Piece and Digimon, it was only a matter of time until we saw another one get introduced into the TCG landscape. Enter the Gundam Card Game, which is yet another well-known anime franchise that joins the ranks of Dragon Ball and Bleach under the Bandai Card Games umbrella. This is not the first time Gundam had a card game, though. In 1999, Gundam War was released in Japan. Now, 25 years later, interest seems to be rising again. From what I’ve seen so far, the Gundam Card Game has very similar mechanics to other Bandai Card Games, but the couple of twists alongside a global release plan make this upcoming release a bit more exciting for both fans and competitive players.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The preview event took place at the NASA Space Center in Houston which was fitting for the space setting that Mobile Suit Gundam is known for. After a brief presentation of the card game and some words from the special guest astronaut Anthony Antonelli, it was time to check out the game. It’s here that we got access to the cards with the opportunity to build our own decks using a mix of provided cards and packs from the Beta Edition. Being familiar with Bandai’s One Piece Card Game among many other TCGs, it was pretty easy to pick up Gundam from the get-go. If the unfamiliar keywords are a little intimidating, the cards usually describe what the mechanics do. With that said, it’s just the beginning of the Gundam Card Game, so mechanics aren’t too complicated at this point if you have any TCG experience.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Gundam Card Game - Beta Kit</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">As far as TCGs go, the Gundam Card Game is pretty standard in regards to the types of cards and abilities you can play. There are four types of cards at the moment including Units, Pilots, Commands, and Bases. Units are of course the mech suits that fans all know and love. The Pilots are for the most part upgrades that you can attach to said Units to buff and occasionally add abilities. Commands are one-time use cards like spells in other games, with effects like drawing cards or removing units from the field. Finally, Bases are used as an extra defensive layer to protect the player’s life count. The goal of the game is to whittle down your opponent's shields down to zero before dealing the winning blow. So much of the gameplay is balancing between attacking your opponent’s units and shields and defending yourself with bases or units that can block with the help of command cards on both fronts.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The resource system is very interesting in this game, because not only does it help the players pay for things, but it also determines whether they can play strong or weak cards. Similar to One Piece and even Hearthstone if you’re not familiar with Bandai Card Games, the player gains resources or mana every turn up until the max of ten on the field. It is possible to get more resources with the help of EX resource cards, which are one-time use versions. Here’s the kicker: cards have both a cost and a level printed on the card. A player’s level is determined by how many resource cards they have in play. So if a player has five resource cards and one EX resource card, they can play a level 6 card – like the rare Wing Gundam unit – as long as they have the available active resources to do so. Even though Wing Gundam costs four resources to play, the player is not allowed to play it until they reach six resources. It sounds daunting to think about in regards to creating and balancing cards on the developer side, but it’s a nice way to progress the gameplay without dealing with super strong cards very early. At least that’s what it appears to do from my perspective. </p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/12/12/winggundam-1733965038414.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Another cool mechanic of the game revolves around the Pilots. Of course with Gundam comes the various pilots from the many series, from the OG man himself Amuro Ray to the brooding Heero Yuy. In addition to improving the capabilities of any given Unit, some Pilots have their primary mech suits, which allow for a special status called Link Unit. When Amuro Ray is attached to an RX-78-2 Gundam, for instance, they gain the Link Unit status allowing the Gundam to attack immediately on the turn it was played. That’s the biggest plus when creating a Link Unit. Otherwise, some cards get added effects as well, like the Pilot Banagher Links, who draws one card when he and Unicorn Gundam gain Link Unit status when pairing. So when it comes to building a solid deck, these synergies seem to play a big part in getting the most value from the cards you are able to play.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">With the cards I had, I was able to create three mono-color decks in green, blue, and white. Green seems to be the more aggressive of the trio, with mechanics like Breach that do additional damage to the opponent’s shield when destroying units. Blue seems more like control, which the color is notoriously known for in card games. This includes pinging units for damage, healing, and even resting or dulling enemy units which allows for attacks on them. And white was full of units that can block, so it’s a very defensive play style. Players can build decks with a max of two colors, which was recommended per the inserts in the kit, but making your own decks is more fun! Not to mention the beautiful art on some of these cards in this game. Like other Bandai Card Games, we can expect totally new alternate art on many of these cards and that’s enough to get any Gundam fan interested in this.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/12/12/gaerialss-1733965059137.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Another interesting announcement for this game was the global release schedule. Having played the One Piece Card Game competitively for some time, there was a lot of discussion about the Japan meta, because the cards were released there first versus other territories. For instance, a card will be really strong in Japan’s competitive scene, so they nerf or ban it by the time it gets to other territories like the States. This didn’t make folks happy and otherwise made a strong and rare card useless. With the global release, this should alleviate all of those concerns and give everyone the same time with new cards before any kind of restriction is warranted. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">When the Gundam Card Game was first revealed, I was excited to see anything Gundam, but to also crossover with a gaming medium that I love was the cherry on top. Having played with other TCGs and experiencing their communities, I can see something similar happening where fans of the series who don’t necessarily play card games want to jump into this game to check it out, which is always great to see. In the end, these kinds of games benefit from the existing fandom and the gameplay is interesting enough to make for some cool deck-building and matches. It’s just getting started, so I’m looking forward to checking out what else they’ll cook up as more sets come out. </p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/assassins-creed-shadows-canon-mode-will-pick-canon-dialogue-choices-for-you.1059033/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/assassins-creed-shadows-canon-mode<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Ubisoft has revealed that it's including something it calls "Canon Mode" in upcoming action RPG&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed Shadows</em>, and if you've ever wondered which dialogue option your character would actually pick, this one's for you.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/assassinscreed/comments/1hbq6qg/hi_we_are_brooke_charles_jonathan_and_thierry/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">recent Reddit AMA (Ask Me Anything) session</a>, creative director Jonathan Dumont says Canon Mode was included to address the fact that&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed</em>'s fanbase is "divided on branching dialogues".</p>

<p>If you select Canon Mode, then dialogue choices will be made for you so that you don't have to worry about whether what you're doing is in character or not. Dumont says this should give players a "choice free experience", which feels like a slightly odd way of wording it.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/assassins-creed-shadows-canon-mode-conversation.jpg?itok=5Yj3fe7q 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/assassins-creed-shadows-canon-mode-conversation.jpg?itok=ceIC5JxH 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Assassin's Creed Shadows&nbsp;</em>will let you have the game decide which response it should give on your behalf in dialogue trees.</figcaption></figure><p>When it comes to the length of the game, Dumont says that while it's "hard to evaluate" such things in open-world games due to player variables, he thinks&nbsp;<em>Shadows</em>' main campaign is "comparable to&nbsp;<em>Origins</em>/<em>Odyssey&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Valhalla</em>" in terms of length.</p>

<p>Again, that feels like a slightly odd answer to give when considering that these three games take different amounts of time to beat.&nbsp;<em>Origins</em>' campaign sits at around 25-30 hours, while&nbsp;<em>Odyssey</em>'s takes about 45 hours and&nbsp;<em>Valhalla</em>'s can take up to 60.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Suffice it to say that you're probably not in for a short ride with&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed Shadows</em>, so hopefully it doesn't have the same level of bloat that&nbsp;<em>Odyssey&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Valhalla&nbsp;</em>could often exhibit.</p>

<p>The AMA offers plenty of other interesting information about&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed Shadows</em>; it'll <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/assassinscreed/comments/1hbq6qg/comment/m1jz42g/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">feature an "immersive mode"</a> with a full Japanese voiceover, for instance, and its <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/assassinscreed/comments/1hbq6qg/comment/m1jv74t/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">modern story</a> will be "limited" and connected to the new Animus Hub, although we'll get more on this "later".</p>




<p><em>Assassin's Creed Shadows&nbsp;</em>is the latest mainline installment in the long-running&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed&nbsp;</em>series. Set in Sengoku-era Japan, it'll follow the RPG stylings of the likes of <i><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/assassins-creed-odyssey" rel="nofollow">Odyssey</a>&nbsp;</i>and&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/assassins-creed-valhalla" rel="nofollow">Valhalla</a>&nbsp;</em>and not the back-to-basics approach of last year's&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/assassins-creed-mirage" rel="nofollow"><em>Mirage</em></a>.</p>

<p>Since its announcement, the game has garnered its fair share of controversy. Some players <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ubisoft-assassins-creed-shadows-controversy" rel="nofollow">objected to the inclusion of historical figure Yasuke</a> as one of the main playable characters, an inclusion Ubisoft says demonstrates its ability to take "creative license" to construct "engaging and immersive experiences".</p>

<p><em>Assassin's Creed Shadows&nbsp;</em>also prompted outcry when a concept art book was found to have <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/assassins-creed-shadows-concept-art-apology" rel="nofollow">appropriated images from a Japanese group</a> without permission, and when an "insensitive" figurine depicting a one-legged Torii gate was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/insensitive-assassins-creed-shadows-figurine-controversy" rel="nofollow">pulled from sale in October</a>.</p>

<p>You'll be able to check out&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed Shadows&nbsp;</em>when it launches on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3159330/Assassins_Creed_Shadows/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/assassins-creed-shadows/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/games/assassins-creed-shadows" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a> in February next year, having been <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-february" rel="nofollow">delayed</a> from its original November release date.</p>

But perhaps the most interesting reveal is the “Canon Mode,” designed to appease players who are concerned about the game’s branching storylines, given the series’ focus on synchronizing with the past.</p><p>“Choices come more into play when recruiting allies and romance [sic] some of the characters,” said Jonathan Dumont, the director on <em>Shadows</em>. “Since the fan base is divided on branching dialogues, we have incorporated an option called CANON MODE which allows you to play the game with choices already made for you, to give you a choice free experience.” Elsewhere in the thread Dumont adds, “You will still be able to switch characters in [the] open in this mode.”</p><p>This news was met with delight by those taking part in the AMA. “Wait, WHAT??? Are you serious? That’s basically what the fanbase has been asking for since 2018,” said one person. “Oh my god, amazing,” replied another. A third suggested, “Wild pitch: retroactively add this mode to <em>Odyssey</em> and <em>Valhalla</em>.”</p><figure id="" data-id="0f054038f8cb7a853b5feaa9adccb21d" data-recommend-id="image://0f054038f8cb7a853b5feaa9adccb21d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1435" data-height="807" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The choice screen for playing as Yasuke or Naoe." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The choice screen for playing as Yasuke or Naoe." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Ubisoft</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="0f054038f8cb7a853b5feaa9adccb21d" data-recommend-id="image://0f054038f8cb7a853b5feaa9adccb21d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1435" data-height="807" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The choice screen for playing as Yasuke or Naoe." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>While there are some very loud voices that strongly believe all games should only be playable in their hardest modes, back in real life everyone approaches games very differently. Some seek super-hard, reflex-heavy combat, and want to be told the story by a fixed narrator, while others love to become embroiled in a twisting narrative on which they have huge influence but want to walk away at the sight of a boss fight. And indeed, everything in-between, outside of that, and the whole lot combined.</p><p>Ubisoft has been making some big strides in the games it <em>does</em> release regarding letting players structure a game according to their own tastes, and while it’s fair to say the publisher has led the way in this regard, many others are now following. Where once we were lucky to choose between Easy, Normal and Hard, it’s becoming more commonplace to let a player tweak specific aspects of their $70 purchase, creating the tone of game that best suits their desires. (We’re edging closer and closer to my <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/assassins-creed-origins-tourism-difficulty&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/assassins-creed-origins-tourism-difficulty" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">skippable boss fight future</a></span>.)</p><p>It seems yet another step in this direction to offer an option to those who simply don’t want to make narrative choices for whatever reason. There are many <em>Assassin’s Creed</em> die-hards who want a single, pure storyline, to make sense of the game’s reliving history through memory, and find the player-driven deviations, well, deviant. For others it could be choice paralysis—that awful fear that you might be picking the “wrong” option, and then worrying about that instead of enjoying the game. The Canon Mode will automatically select what the developers consider the true, historical path through the game, which the same AMA confirms will have a single canon ending.</p><p>And, of course, for those who find the idea plain strange, it is just an option, with a branching storyline for the two different characters set as the game’s default.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Mythical Island is the first proper Pokémon TCG Pocket mini-set since the title’s launch. It brings with it the second-ever booster pack for players to pull new cards, and we know its release date, as well as a bunch of cards revealed for the set.</p>



<p>The Pokémon TCG Pocket <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-next-expansion-rumors-leaks/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">next expansion leaks</a> continue to be true. We heard weeks ago a mini-set was scheduled for the third week in December, and now we know what it is. Pokémon TCG Pocket Mythical Island is a fully-fledged mini-set not quite on the scale of Genetic Apex, but it’s easily the most significant collection of cards—outside of the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-promo-a-cards-in-pokemon-tcg-pocket-how-to-unlock/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Promo A</a> series.</p>



<p>The Mythical Island debut trailer gave us a huge glimpse into the set and what to expect.</p>



<h2 id="h-mythical-island-set-release-date-in-pokemon-tcg-pocket">Mythical Island Set Release Date in Pokémon TCG Pocket</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Just look at it. Credit to The Pokémon Company</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Pokémon TCG Pocket’s Mythical Island set launches on Dec. 17.</strong></p>



<p>No official release time was given in the debut <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUYHC2ReohA" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Pokémon TCG Pocket: Mythical Island trailer</a>. So, expect a midnight rollout for the set in your region. Once it’s live, select the new booster pack, start ripping them open, and get building the newest set in Pocket.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-open-mythical-island-packs-in-pokemon-tcg-pocket-mythical-island">How to Open Mythical Island Packs in Pokémon TCG Pocket: Mythical Island</h2>



<p>We don’t know for sure, but I imagine once Mythical Island is live, the <strong>advertised packs on the home page are going to change to reflect the new set</strong>. Meaning, you can press on any of the advertised Mythical Island packs, and it takes you straight to them.</p>



<p>On the other hand, if it still shows Genetic Apex packs on the home screen once the new set launches, try this:</p>



<ol>
<li>Go to the home screen.</li>



<li>Press on any of the Genetic Apex packs to take you to the pack screen.</li>



<li>Choose “Select other booster packs” in the bottom-right corner to presumably choose Mythical Island.</li>



<li>Now, open Mythical Island packs!</li>
</ol>



<p>It’s hard to know fully what Pokémon TCG Pocket looks like when Mythical Island launches, so we’ll update this once we have a clearer indication.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-many-cards-in-mythical-island-set-in-pokemon-tcg-pocket">How Many Cards in Mythical Island Set in Pokémon TCG Pocket?</h2>



<p>NetEase hasn’t divulged how many cards are coming in Mythical Island, but thanks to the debut trailer, we’ve identified at least <strong>15 new cards coming in the set</strong>.</p>



<p>Here’s every card we think we’ve spotted in Mythical Island so far:</p>



<ul>
<li>Aerodactyl ex</li>



<li>Blue (Supporter Card)</li>



<li>Dedenne (Full Art)</li>



<li>Dhelmise</li>



<li>Exeggcute</li>



<li>Larvesta</li>



<li>Leaf (Supporter Card)</li>



<li>Magmar</li>



<li>Marshadow (Full Art)</li>



<li>Mew ex</li>



<li>Morelull</li>



<li>Pikachu</li>



<li>Snivy</li>



<li>Tauros</li>



<li>Vaporean (Full Art)</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-rarest-cards-in-mythical-island-set-in-pokemon-tcg-pocket">Rarest Cards in Mythical Island Set in Pokémon TCG Pocket</h2>



<p>So far, <strong>Dedenne, Marshadow, and Vaporean Full Art</strong> cards, along with <strong>Mew ex</strong> and <strong>Aerodactyl ex</strong>, are the rarest cards we’ve seen in the Mythical Island set.</p>



<p>More could still be announced, and the full set is likely keeping some secrets under its belt. We can all find out together once Mythical Island is live!</p>

			<p>NVIDIA's weekly GeForce NOW Thursday update focuses on two classic PC games that just got remastered: The Thing and Legacy of Kain Soul Reaver 1&amp;2.</p>
<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2958970/The_Thing_Remastered/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Thing: Remastered</a> enhances 2002's third-person shooter game based on John Carpenter's seminal 1982 movie. Computer Artworks originally developed the game, but the remaster was handled by Nightdive, the studio behind so many excellent remasters (System Shock, Turok, Doom 64, Shadowman, Quake, Quake II, Star Wars: Dark Forces) and the recent full-fledged remake of System Shock. Once again, they delivered a great PC remaster that adds anti-aliasing, per-pixel lighting, 4K resolution and up to 144 frames per second. On GeForce NOW, Performance tier subscribers can play up to 1440p, while Ultimate tier subscribers can play at up to 4K and 120 frames per second.</p>
<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2521380/Legacy_of_Kain_Soul_Reaver_12_Remastered/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Legacy of Kain Soul Reaver 1&amp;2 Remastered</a>, on the other hand, celebrates the franchise's 25th anniversary with a remaster of Raziel's classic tale of vampiric vengeance. The game originally developed by Crystal Dynamic has been remastered by Aspyr, another development studio well versed with remasters (but not with remakes, as we <a href="https://wccftech.com/knights-of-the-old-republic-remake-delayed/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">learned</a> with Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic), and it features cut-scenes rendered with higher fidelity models, brand new hero models for Raziel and Kain, new enemy and boss models, a new glow effect to Raziel's eyes and the Wraith Blade, real-time shadows applied to all characters and objects, a Day and Night cycle that was cut from the final version of the original game, a Photo Mode, and a brand new map and compass.</p>
<p>Of course, earlier this week, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-indiana-at-his-finest/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a> also became playable via GeForce NOW wherever you have the license for it (Steam, Microsoft Store, and PC Game Pass). GFN Ultimate subscribers can even enable the gorgeous path tracing that was <a href="https://wccftech.com/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-update-enables-path-tracing-on-nvidia-rtx-gpus-amd-fsr-to-be-added-later/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">added </a>on Monday with the first update.</p>
<p>The rest of the weekly GeForce NOW list includes the following additions to the cloud platform's library:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fast Food Simulator (New release on Steam, Dec. 10)</li>
<li>The Spirit of the Samurai (New release on Steam, Dec. 12)</li>
<li>Diablo Immortal (Battle.net)</li>
<li>The Lord of the Rings: Return to Moria (Steam)</li>
</ul>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/balatro-sales-hit-3-5m</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/balatro-sales-hit-3-5m-in-less-than-a-year-as-game-awards-near.1058985/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/balatro-sales-hit-3-5m<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Balatro&nbsp;</em>developer LocalThunk and publisher Playstack have announced another major new sales milestone for the game, further cementing its massive success as this year's Game Awards loom.</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://x.com/BalatroGame/status/1866905061609078866" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">a message on social media platform X</a>,&nbsp;<em>Balatro&nbsp;</em>has managed to rack up an eye-watering 3.5 million sales since its release earlier this year, which is a pretty monumental figure given the game's relatively small size and niche subject matter.</p>

<p>As the post itself says, developer LocalThunk started out simply wishing to make "a game for myself and a few friends", but&nbsp;<em>Balatro&nbsp;</em>quickly grew beyond those boundaries, reaching the kind of global audience many indies can only dream of.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/balatro-3.5m-sales-cards.jpg?itok=hzNSLVYb 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/balatro-3.5m-sales-cards.jpg?itok=JAID0XoJ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Balatro&nbsp;</em>has hit yet another big sales milestone.</figcaption></figure><p><em>Balatro&nbsp;</em>was released back in February, and since then, it's become an absolutely huge hit. The game managed to rack up <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/balatro-sales-half-million" rel="nofollow">half a million sales in just ten days</a>, and its pace didn't let up; just twelve days after that,&nbsp;<em>Balatro&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/balatro-sales-one-million" rel="nofollow">crossed a million sales</a>.</p>

<p>By August, the poker roguelike's sales figures <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/balatro-sales-reach-2-million-as-devs-promise-first-major-update-soon" rel="nofollow">had hit two million</a>, with developer LocalThunk promising that&nbsp;<em>Balatro</em>'s first major update would arrive in 2025, bringing "new ideas and strategies" to freshen the game up.</p>

<p>As an indie darling,&nbsp;<em>Balatro&nbsp;</em>has hardly stayed in its own pen, either. It's crossed over with other indie smash hits like&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/balatro-update-crossovers-cyberpunk" rel="nofollow">Stardew Valley</a>&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Potion Craft</em>, as well as the likes of&nbsp;<em>Cyberpunk 2077&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/big-dave-diver-collaboration-update-balatro" rel="nofollow"><em>Dave the Diver</em></a>.</p>

<p>While the game was initially released for PC and consoles, it also <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/balatro-mobile-release-date" rel="nofollow">secured itself a mobile release</a> back in September, and given the bite-sized nature of&nbsp;<em>Balatro</em>, it's hard to imagine that release hasn't contributed significantly to the game's success.</p>




<p>Such is&nbsp;<em>Balatro</em>'s monumental success that it's the only indie game <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/game-awards-2024-nominees-announced" rel="nofollow">nominated for the Game of the Year award</a> at this year's Game Awards, the ceremony for which will take place later today.</p>

<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Balatro&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2379780/Balatro/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/balatro/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/balatro/9PK087LNGJC5" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/balatro-switch/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch</a>, and mobile devices.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Pokemon TCG Pocket Reveals New Mythical Island Expansion Set]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-tcg-pocket-mythical-island-expansion</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/pokemon-tcg-pocket-reveals-new-mythical-island-expansion-set.1058982/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-tcg-pocket-mythical-island-expansion<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The Pokemon Company has announced a brand new&nbsp;<em>Pokemon TCG Pocket&nbsp;</em>expansion set, which will bring over 80 new cards for you to collect and battle with next week.</p>

<p>Landing on December 17th, the Mythical Island set isn't the game's next full expansion; rather, it's a sort of stopgap set that introduces a new kind of booster pack. It looks from the pack's in-game artwork that Mythical Island represents expansion A1a.</p>

<p>Although this set won't quite be on the same level as&nbsp;<em>Pokemon TCG Pocket</em>'s base Genetic Apex set, it will introduce new EX cards, new Trainer cards, and some new immersive artwork cards as well, so it's still worth getting excited about if you're a&nbsp;<em>Pokemon TCG Pocket&nbsp;</em>fan.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pokemon-tcg-pocket-mythical-island-expansion-mew-ex.jpg?itok=NoIvBy3U 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pokemon-tcg-pocket-mythical-island-expansion-mew-ex.jpg?itok=nHlZd1x5 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Pokemon TCG Pocket</em>'s new set may not be Genetic Apex-sized, but it's got plenty of new cards for you to collect.</figcaption></figure><p>Among the new cards are EX versions of Mew and Aerodactyl. The former packs a move called Genome Hacking that allows you to use one of your opponent's attacks, while Aerodactyl has the Primeval Law ability, preventing an opponent's active Pokemon from being evolved.</p>

<p>Plenty of other new cards will be introduced as part of this set, including full art versions of Marshadow, Vaporeon, and Dedenne, as well as an EX version of Marowak.</p>

<p>You can also look forward to Trainer cards depicting iconic Pokemon Trainers like Blue and Leaf, as well as new basic cards for the likes of Magmar, Tauros, and Exeggcute, among others.</p>

<h2>When is the new&nbsp;<em>Pokemon TCG Pocket&nbsp;</em>expansion launching?</h2>

<p>Since&nbsp;<em>Pokemon TCG Pocket</em>'s Mythical Island set doesn't represent the next major expansion, you might well be wondering when that expansion will launch.</p>

<p>If a <a href="https://x.com/CentroLeaks/status/1855422922384351518" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Centro Leaks event leak</a> from November (which accurately predicted the launch of this A1a pack) is to be believed, then we can expect the new expansion to arrive on January 30th. It's currently codenamed A2, although we don't know what it will actually be called or what the theming will be yet.</p>




<p>If you're wondering exactly what&nbsp;<em>Pokemon TCG Pocket&nbsp;</em>is, it's a condensed mobile version of the popular trading card game that allows you to collect and battle lots of different Pokemon in card form.</p>

<p>Released <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-tcg-pocket-release-date" rel="nofollow">in late October</a>, the game features a basic version of the standard&nbsp;<em>Pokemon TCG&nbsp;</em>battle system, as well as over 200 cards to collect as part of the Genetic Apex set. Future updates will also add <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-tcg-pocket-trading-future-updates" rel="nofollow">new features like trading</a>&nbsp;in the coming months.</p>

<p>It's proven hugely popular among players; earlier today, The Pokemon Company revealed that&nbsp;<em>Pokemon TCG Pocket&nbsp;</em>has <a href="https://press.pokemon.com/en/releases/Pokemon-Trading-Card-Game-Pocket-Celebrates-60-Million-Downloads-Since" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">racked up 60 million downloads</a> since its October launch, which is not too shabby at all.</p>

<p>You can download&nbsp;<em>Pokemon TCG Pocket&nbsp;</em>for free right now on <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/pok%C3%A9mon-tcg-pocket/id6479970832" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">iOS</a> and <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=jp.pokemon.pokemontcgp&amp;hl=en_GB" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Android</a> devices.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/epic-and-lego-have-a-long-term-plan-to-make-fortnite-more-than-battle-royale.1058979/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/12/24319151/lego-fortnite-epic-games-future-battle-royale-interview<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>A year ago, Epic kicked off a bold plan to turn <em>Fortnite</em> into a broader ecosystem for all kinds of games. And that plan was <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/12/7/23990660/lego-fortnite-release-epic">led by the launch of <em>Lego Fortnite</em></a>, a <em>Minecraft</em>-style survival game that sits alongside the likes of battle royale and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/12/9/23992574/fortnite-festival-harmonix-guitar-hero-rock-band">the music-themed <em>Fortnite Festival</em></a> inside of <em>Fortnite</em>. Now, Epic is pushing into another new direction with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/9/24316954/lego-fortnite-brick-life-social-roleplay-game">the launch of <em>Brick Life</em></a>, a Lego-themed city where players can live virtual lives, much <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/8/11/23828431/rockstar-cfx-re-mod-tools-roleplay-server">like in <em>Grand Theft Auto </em>roleplaying servers</a>.</p></div><p>The ongoing goal, according to Devin Winterbottom, Epic’s executive vice president of game development, is to keep expanding in ways that make people rethink what <em>Fortnite</em> actually is. “The worst outcome for us is that everything looks like battle royale,” Winterbottom says. “That’s not what we want to do.”</p><p>For <em>Brick Life</em>, that takes the form of a family-friendly nonviolent space where players can explore and socialize inside of a Lego city. It launches today as part of a broader rebranding of Lego Fortnite; now, those two words refer to a hub that houses all of the Lego experiences in the game, while the survival title has been renamed <em>Lego Fortnite Odyssey</em>. In between those two major releases, Lego has also released <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/27/24084644/fortnite-new-lego-games-raft-survival-obby-fun">a handful of smaller, more experimental games</a> meant to broaden the audience even more.</p><p>Remi Marcelli, head of games at Lego, says that the initial plan for these experiments was to be very different from <em>Fortnite</em> as we know it now — that’s why one of the first releases was about <a href="https://www.fortnite.com/@thelegogroup/4051-8342-2747?lang=en-US">taking care of cats on a cozy island</a>. “We launched Cat Island Adventure, where you had to find kittens and nurture them, which is the furthest away from battle royale that we could think of,” he explains. “We had a decent playerbase at launch, but it was sort of lost in an environment where nobody was opening <em>Fortnite</em> to play that specific type of game.”</p><div><p>“The worst outcome for us is that everything looks like battle royale.”</p></div><p>One of the key things the Lego team learned over the last 12 months through those kinds of launches, according to Marcelli, is to attempt to appeal to as broad an audience as possible. “If we want to be relevant, we need to appeal to everyone, including the hardcore battle royale players,” he explains. “We need to find things that are exciting enough for them to visit us. Finding that match is what we’ve been trying to do for the entire year.” A hope is that the new hub area will help make some of those more offbeat experiences like the cat island easier to discover for players.</p><p>An issue for all of these new game experiences within <em>Fortnite</em> is competing with the behemoth that is battle royale. Right now, all of the various iterations of BR — like Zero Build or <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/12/24294616/fortnite-og-permanent-december-release-date"><em>Fortnite</em> OG</a> — still dominate in terms of pure player count. And while some other games, like <em>Odyssey</em>, have carved out a large audience, others, like <em>Rocket Racing</em> from <em>Rocket League</em> developer Psyonix, <a href="https://www.fortnite.com/news/learn-whats-new-in-rocket-racing-v31-40">have struggled</a>.</p><p>“The battle royale product can kind of distort and make it difficult to see success,” says Winterbottom. “<em>Odyssey</em> can look smaller compared to some of the other stuff that’s in the ecosystem, but it’s actually a successful game. It has a lot of players. If you were to see it as a standalone product outside of the ecosystem, the numbers that it generates would be considered very successful.” But he adds that “we believe success comes in a lot of different sizes. There are games that can be really compelling for a small group of players, and that variety is good. Not everything needs to be a monolithic mega game. That’s actually bad in our opinion.”</p><p>And while we’re already a year out, it’s also still early in the grand scheme of this plan to turn <em>Fortnite</em> into a video game platform. Right now, that includes everything from <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/7/24315134/fortnite-ballistic-counter-strike-first-person-shooter-fps">first-person shooters</a> to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/14/24296627/fortnite-tmnt-roguelike-user-made-games-creators">Ninja Turtles roguelikes</a> to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/30/24305460/fortnite-chapter-2-remix-concert-eminem-snoop-juice-wrld-ice-spice">musical experiences</a>, in addition to an ever-growing list of battle royale variations (and eventually <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/4/24261555/epic-disney-fortnite-unreal-fest">something big with Disney</a>). Lego, meanwhile, offers a big opportunity to appeal to a very broad audience — and both teams are thinking very far out. “We’re in this for a very long term partnership,” says Winterbottom. “We talk about this in decade increments, not years.”</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

It is founded by industry veterans with experience from multiple top-tier game companies including Gearbox Entertainment, <a title="Companies > id Software [152 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/zenimax-media/id-software">id Software</a>, and Warner Bros., and will focus on delivering “premium titles that emphasize bringing more refined gaming experiences that players can enjoy at their own pace without the need of large time investments.” <span id="more-933531"></span></p><p>The company’s founders include:</p><ul><li>Steve Gibson, chief executive officer – Former president of <a title="Companies > Gearbox Publishing [110 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/the-gearbox-entertainment-company/gearbox-publishing">Gearbox Publishing</a></li><li>Matt Charles, chief product officer</li><li>Erick Cobbs, chief business officer</li><li>Jackson Hardesty, chief operations officer</li><li>Brad Schliesser, chief revenue officer</li><li>Jimmy Sieben, chief technology officer</li><li>Jeff Skal, chief marketing officer</li></ul><p>“Our team is confident rational business models will be a long-term strength of Cooldown Games and that just might be a refreshing contrast from many recent industry trends,” said Cooldown Games CEO Steve Gibson in a press release. “My passion of helping game makers reach as many game players as possible while making sure that it’s a rewarding experience for everyone involved is at the center of all of this. Let’s make some great games together.”</p><p>Cooldown Games chief marketing officer Jeff Skal added, “Over the last five years, we all individually noticed that we’ve been gravitating away from many of the predictable new releases. We noticed that was because most of us already have ‘forever’ games—for me and Brad that’s <em>World of Warcraft</em>, and for Jackson that’s <em>DayZ</em>—and most of these giant new releases were just asking for more than we could give. When we started Cooldown Games, we quickly realized that there’s a ton of gamers out there just like us—and we wanted to find the best games that can fit in between our sessions, or seasons, or even just after raid night.”</p><p>Chief product officer Matt Charles said, “Many talented developers weathered the recent industry turbulence and now more than ever seek a partner that understands their project’s vision and how it will resonate with an audience. We are looking to work with astute and passionate teams that share our philosophy and observation about player behavior, and we can create a force-multiplying partnership on the path to release.”</p><!-- AD: content -->

                <p>Player choices have been a big part of the Assassin's Creed franchise, and that's still going to be true in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-release-date-gameplay-and-everything-we-know/1100-6523576/" data-ref-id="1100-6523576">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a>. However, for any fans who don't want to agonize over which branching dialogue option to pick or who to romance, Ubisoft is introducing a new canon mode in Shadows that will let the players simply experience the story without having to make any choices of their own.</p><p>Shadows director Jonathan Dumont revealed the new option during <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/assassinscreed/comments/1hbq6qg/hi_we_are_brooke_charles_jonathan_and_thierry/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">a Reddit appearance</a> alongside other developers from the game.</p><p>"Choices come more into play when recruiting allies and [romancing] some of the characters," said Dumont. "Since the fan base is divided on branching dialogues, we have incorporated an option called Canon Mode which allows you to play the game with choices already made for you, to give you a choice-free experience. Hope this makes it fun for everyone."</p><p>Dumont also noted that Shadows is close to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/assassins-creed-origins-review/1900-6416794/" data-ref-id="1900-6416794">Assassin's Creed Origins</a> in terms of scale. Associate Narrative Director Brooke Davies added that the two main characters, Naoe and Yasuke, can pick their preferred romantic partners outside of Canon Mode for both "shorter and longer romance opportunities." She also said, "The story of Shadows culminates in a single, [canonical] ending. That said there are many unique paths leading to this point, and in particular that will determine who is (and isn't) at your side along the way."</p><p>The developers confirmed that Shadows <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-will-introduce-a-new-direction-for-its-modern-day-story/1100-6527555/" data-ref-id="1100-6527555">will introduce a new direction for the modern-day storyline</a>. Dumont indicated that Shadows "will be different than what we have done in the past, but that is connected to our modern-day lore and will develop over time in the Animus Hub and subsequent titles." He also said that Hattori Hanzō from Assassin's Creed: Memories will appear in Shadows.</p><p>Additionally, Davies indicated that Naoe and Yasuke won't immediately be on the same side.</p><p>"Their paths do ultimately converge and we see them form a league together around common cause," said Davies. "That said, this path is not always smooth and straight, and their unique backgrounds and perspectives do not always align. This is something we will see them and sometimes even help them to work through by making some interesting choices."</p><p>Ubisoft recently shared a lengthy overview of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-will-dramatically-alter-how-it-plays-based-on-your-character-and-weapons/1100-6528362/" data-ref-id="1100-6528362">how combat will work in Shadows</a>. Details about <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-battle-pass-allegedly-leaks-showing-off-futuristic-and-mythological-cosmetics/1100-6527789/" data-ref-id="1100-6527789">the game's battle pass</a> have leaked online, and Ubisoft has stated that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-clarifies-rumors-about-animus-hub-the-new-name-of-assassins-creed-infinity/1100-6527804/" data-ref-id="1100-6527804">the rewards in the Animus Hub are free</a>. Assassin's Creed Shadows will hit PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC on February 14, 2025.</p>

During a recent interview, Treyarch's Associate Creative Director Miles Leslie hinted that the team already has its favorite maps to revisit, and no map is off the table.</p><p>"We put a ton of consideration into the prospective remasters with each new game," Leslie told <a href="https://www.dexerto.com/call-of-duty/black-ops-6-dev-hints-at-more-classic-map-remasters-in-the-works-3004483/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Dextero</a>. "We know there are certain fan favorites that players would like to see again, and we have some of our own favorites that we've had on a wish list over the years. I'll just say that while we're still focused on delivering original designs as the majority of our post-launch maps, no previous Black Ops title is off the table for potential remasters."</p><p>Earlier this month, a Call of Duty leaker reported <a href="https://twitter.com/ForwardLeaksAlt/status/1865886089459724507?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1865886089459724507%7Ctwgr%5E6a71a8dbfc6110c6c0e803b26c91df7fe95a62f3%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dexerto.com%2Fcall-of-duty%2Fcod-leak-reveals-fan-favorite-black-ops-map-set-to-return-in-near-future-3002067%2F" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">that the Launch map</a> from <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/call-of-duty-black-ops-review/1900-6283815/" data-ref-id="1900-6283815">Call of Duty: Black Ops 1</a> will return with a new title, Cosmodome, in either Black Ops 6 or the next Call of Duty game that's coming in 2025. This rumor has yet to be confirmed.</p><p>Prior to the launch of Season 1, Treyarch laid out <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/free-black-ops-6-gameplay-trial-is-coming-this-month-provides-access-to-zombies-and-multiplayer/1100-6528203/" data-ref-id="1100-6528203">everything players can expect to see in Black Ops 6</a>. The developer also revealed that a free trial for Black Ops 6's multiplayer and Zombies modes will begin on December 13 for a limited time.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/sunless-sea-director-announces-new-narrative-crpg-travelling-at-night.1058913/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sunless-sea-director-travelling-at-night<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Sunless Sea&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Cultist Simulator&nbsp;</em>designer Alexis Kennedy has announced&nbsp;<em>Travelling At Night</em>, which he describes as a "dialogue-driven choices-matter combat-free CRPG" that's not a million miles away from the likes of&nbsp;<em>Disco Elysium</em>.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://weatherfactory.biz/announcing-travelling-at-night/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">an announcement post</a> on his studio Weather Factory's official website, Kennedy says that while he's been "making narrative games for fifteen years", he's "never made a traditional isometric CRPG", likening doing so to a composer "hav[ing] a go at opera".</p>

<p>Rather tantalizingly, Kennedy says he was once contracted as a narrative consultant on a "really promising and heavily NDA'd RPG for a developer [he admires] and on a franchise [he likes]". Of course, he doesn't name what that RPG is, but he does say its cancellation made him regret not working within the genre.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/alexis-kennedy-sunless-sea-travelling-at-night.jpg?itok=zxv5TDBP 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/alexis-kennedy-sunless-sea-travelling-at-night.jpg?itok=nX5qPVyA 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Sunless Sea&nbsp;</em>designer Alexis Kennedy is back with a brand new project.</figcaption></figure><p>If you're thinking that&nbsp;<em>Travelling At Night&nbsp;</em>looks an awful lot like&nbsp;<em>Disco Elysium&nbsp;</em>from the screenshot above, then you're not wrong, and it's a game Kennedy himself brings up in the game's announcement post.</p>

<p>He says that while he and his partner Lottie Bevan considered using the word "discolike" to describe their game, they didn't want players thinking they were pursuing&nbsp;<em>Disco Elysium</em>'s "distinctive nihilistic funny sex'n'drugs'n'disco vibe".</p>

<p>However, Kennedy and Bevan did incur a "creative debt" to&nbsp;<em>Disco Elysium</em>, and&nbsp;<em>Travelling At Night&nbsp;</em>is aiming to find the same "audience for something CRPG-esque with really unorthodox creative choices".</p>

<p>As such, while Weather Factory isn't <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ex-disco-elysium-devs-new-studios-spiritual-successors" rel="nofollow">one of a number of studios</a> currently operating out of the ashes of&nbsp;<em>Disco Elysium&nbsp;</em>developer ZA/UM (including <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/gaming-industry/game-development/for-a-while-it-seemed-like-miracles-were-possible-and-with-them-redemption-a-follow-up-to-the-legendary-disco-elysium-might-have-been-ready-to-play-within-the-next-yearzaums-devs-loved-it-management-canceled-it-and-laid-off-the-team/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">ZA/UM itself</a>), you can consider&nbsp;<em>Travelling At Night&nbsp;</em>another contender for the&nbsp;<em>Disco&nbsp;</em>crown.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/travelling-at-night-stats.jpg?itok=U1PhEwQT 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/travelling-at-night-stats.jpg?itok=saT476ht 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Travelling At Night&nbsp;</em>isn't subtle about its influences.</figcaption></figure><p>With regards to the production cycle, Kennedy says he estimates&nbsp;<em>Travelling At Night&nbsp;</em>will take "between two and four years", and that he's hoping for a day one Steam Deck launch as well.</p>

<p>He describes the game's art direction as "determinedly non-realistic" while still being "plausibly CRPG", and confirms that&nbsp;<em>Travelling At Night&nbsp;</em>won't have an "intentionally inchoate player-cipher" character, but instead a defined protagonist by the name of Spencer Hobson.</p>

In the meantime, you can read our <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/book-of-hours-review-fascinating-journey-of-many-words" rel="nofollow">review of Weather Factory's last game&nbsp;<em>Book of Hours&nbsp;</em>right here</a>.</p>
