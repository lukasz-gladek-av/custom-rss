            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/resident-evil-requiem/">Resident Evil Requiem</a> is shaping up to be one of the most ambitious entries in years, and the <a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-requiem-gamescom-hands-on-preview-turn-on-the-lights/">demo</a> I tried during <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/gamescom-2025/">Gamescom</a> last month proved how the whole experience will be elevated by high-quality ray-traced lighting and layered sound design, which made every dark corridor haunting and every escape attempt tense, even in a noisy, expo environment. And if new rumors are to be believed, Resident Evil Requiem may also deliver the most complex narrative the series has seen.</p>



<p>In a new video shared on YouTube by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@ROEnetwork">Residence of Evil</a>, well-known leaker Dusk Golem went over the rumors currently circulating regarding the next entry in the series launching next year, revealing some additional, previously unknown details. As previously mentioned, Leon will be the second playable character in the game besides Grace, and the classic Resident Evil series protagonist will feature in the ninth entry in the series with an older appearance - unshaven and with greying hair. </p>



<p>Leon's gameplay segments, which are expected to be revealed during this week's Tokyo Game Show, will be action-oriented, but in a more grounded sort of way than <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/resident-evil-4/">Resident Evil 4</a> or <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/resident-evil-village-horror-greatest-hits/">Resident Evil Village</a>, doing away with enemies like possessed statues and more. Generally, the insider expects these action segments, which will take place in larger environments also featuring vehicles to move from one location to another, similar to the boat section in Resident Evil 4, to be compared to <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-last-of-us-part-ii-remastered-the-definitive-package/">The Last of Us Part II gameplay.</a></p>



<p>The most interesting thing Dusk Golem revealed about Resident Evil Requiem is how Grace's and Leon's campaigns will be set in different years. Most of Grace's campaign will be set in 2028, while Leon's in 2020, and both will form a large, cohesive and interconnected story. While the Resident Evil series has often featured different campaigns with different main characters interconnected on some levels, this would be the first time this element is brought to such a scale.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="RESIDENT EVIL 9: REQUIEM | NEW LEAKS! | LEON REVEAL, GAMEPLAY, VEHICLES &amp; More!" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NnvzOMHoDL4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>While Dusk Golem proved to have access to insider information in the past, we still have to take everything revealed in the video above with a healthy grain of salt. Thankfully, it's very likely we won't have to wait much longer to see Leon's new appearance and gameplay. No matter when this reval will occur, we know for certain we won't have to wait until Resident Evil Requiem launches on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S, and Nintendo Switch on February 27, 2026 to learn more about its more action-focused elements.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fortnite-daft-punk-collab</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/fortnite-daft-punk-collab-confirmed-launches-later-this-week.1304409/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Epic Games has announced the latest band to make its way into&nbsp;<em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em>as a crossover, and it's none other than legendary French house duo Daft Punk, who will feature in the game as an "experience" later this week.</p>

<p>As revealed in an <a href="https://www.fortnite.com/news/party-harder-better-faster-stronger-in-fortnite-with-the-daft-punk-experience?lang=en-US" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">official blog post</a>,&nbsp;<em>Fortnite</em>'s Daft Punk Experience will begin on September 27th, and rather than just consisting of a few songs for&nbsp;<em>Fortnite Festival&nbsp;</em>or a couple of skins, it'll serve as a full-scale "sonic journey", according to Epic.</p>

<p>In the post, Epic says the experience will take players to a "transformative dancefloor destination" where they'll be able to "remix Daft Punk's music at Dream Chamber Studios" or "blast hordes of robots with a soundwave laser in the Robot Rock Arena".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/fortnite-daft-punk-collab-skins.jpg?itok=5b-1BR1N 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/fortnite-daft-punk-collab-skins.jpg?itok=wY2SvpAe 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Fortnite</em>'s new Daft Punk collab isn't just skins, but those are on offer too.</figcaption></figure><p>If that doesn't tickle your fancy, then perhaps you'd prefer to "make a Lego music video at Around the World" or "hit the Daft Club to dance til dawn". Furniture company Hervet Manufacturier, which has worked with Daft Punk in the past, will also have several virtual pieces displayed throughout the experience.</p>

<p>Epic is also promising an "afterparty" for the Daft Punk experience, but the studio is keeping the details close to its chest for now, promising to reveal more info about that "at a later date".</p>

<p>Of course, if you do want to pick up some Daft Punk skins for your&nbsp;<em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em>character, you can do so with a new bundle that launches this Thursday. It's got two new outfits and a bunch of accessories for you to spruce up your battle royale-ing with.</p>

<p>Daft Punk is far from the first artist to feature in&nbsp;<em>Fortnite</em>. The duo follows on from the likes of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fortnite-festival-hatsune-miku-crossover" rel="nofollow">Hatsune Miku</a>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fortnite-festival-reveals-first-glimpse-of-weeknd-gameplay" rel="nofollow">The Weeknd</a>, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fortnite-the-big-bang-eminem" rel="nofollow">rap legend Eminem</a>, among many others.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/fortnite-eminem-skins.jpg?itok=HMJkSiLA 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/fortnite-eminem-skins.jpg?itok=n0xRxKau 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Daft Punk isn't the first artist to get its own&nbsp;<em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em>skins.</figcaption></figure><p>News of the&nbsp;<em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em>Daft Punk collab follows the announcement of a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fortnite-v-bucks-exact-amount" rel="nofollow">new exact amount-focused V-Bucks purchasing option</a> earlier this month, allowing you to buy only the V-Bucks you need for skins and accessories instead of buying bundles and having currency left over.</p>

<p><em>Fortnite</em>'s Daft Punk collab lands on September 27th, and the "grand opening" for the event kicks off at 2pm Eastern that day, so make sure to be there if you want to see it all begin.</p>

		<p>I'm not sure what to do with myself. The Chicago Bears looked...good? Excellent? Yes, yes, I know the Cowboys defense is notoriously bad and yes, yes the Bears nearly gave up a franchise high amount of points to the Lions just one week ago—but let me have this moment. Let me hold onto it, before it slips away a week from now. We'll probably do exactly that on a podcast I'm about to record with Rob, but if you're also wondering "Hey, I wanna hear more about stuff going horribly wrong at Rob's house," don't worry, we have an entire HOA in the bank that you'll hear in the near future. I'm told that even in the weeks since recording that, there's more to talk about it. Somehow, I should not be surprised. And yet?</p><p>-pk, who keeps thinking he'll get tired of <em>Silksong</em> but has not</p><hr><figure></figure><ul><li><strong>PODCAST: </strong><em>Sports!</em> – What exactly did you think was going to happen when the Chicago Bears have a kick ass win in a year where we're desperate for hope?

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Daft Punk, one of the biggest electronic dance music groups in history, is coming soon to <a href="https://kotaku.com/gaijin-war-thunder-fortnite-the-pit-deal-millions-epic-1851786813"><em>Fortnite</em></a> alongside some classic tracks, Lego skins, new emotes, and also a big confirmation from Epic that, no, they aren’t getting back together. Sorry.</p> <p>On September 22, after some online leaks and teases, <a href="https://www.fortnite.com/news/party-harder-better-faster-stronger-in-fortnite-with-the-daft-punk-experience">Epic officially announced that Daft Punk</a> was coming to <em>Fortnite</em> as part of a large in-game event. The robotic duo will arrive in Epic’s ever-growing battle royale on September 27 as part of something called the “Daft Punk Experience.” This will be an in-game location that players can visit alone or with friends, and it will feature various activities, including the ability to remix Daft Punk’s music, a horde mode featuring robots, and a dance club.</p> <p>But before all that, on September 25, cosmetic items based on the duo will be added to <a href="https://kotaku.com/fortnite-missing-characters-wishlist-grimace-agent-47-weird-al-star-trek-2000617211"><em>Fortnite’s</em> in-game shop</a>. Cosmetics include multiple Daft Punk outfits, emotes, weapon skins, in-game music tracks, and even some adorable Lego minifigs based on the famous robots.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000627583" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000627583"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000627583">©Epic Games / Daft Punk</figcaption></figure> <p>Now, if you’re a big fan of Daft Punk like me, you might see all this news and start thinking that maybe, just maybe, the duo is about to get back together. Perhaps this is just a tease of something bigger. A new album? A new song? A new tour? Well, bad news: Epic makes it very clear in the post announcing all of the new <em>Fortnite</em> x Daft Punk content that, no, the group is not getting back together. First, Epic starts the post off with a mention of the group being “no longer” around and then, to make it very clear, Epic included this in the event’s FAQ:</p> <blockquote> <ul> <li><em>Is Daft Punk getting back together?</em></li> <li>No. The Daft Punk Experience is an immersive music experience based on the band’s beloved music. The band is not getting back together.</li> </ul> </blockquote> <p>So there you go. Sorry about that. Of course, if they wanted it to be a surprise, that’s exactly what they would say. So perhaps there is still a chance… (Editor’s note: It’s not happening, Zack. Move on.)</p>

Black Ops 7 is set in the year 2035, which helps explain why some of the gameplay looks semi-futuristic. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>A new survey shared on <a href="https://x.com/MGSMGN/status/1969354623007014979">X (formerly Twitter) by user Metal Gear Network</a> (spotted by <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/konami-asked-fans-which-metal-gear-remade/">Insider-Gaming</a>) reveals that Konami wants to know which Metal Gear Solid game fans think should get the remake treatment next, now that we're beyond the release of Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://questant.jp/q/7DNR3EOO">survey</a> is entirely in Japanese, so unless you can read it or have a translation tool handy, you'll probably struggle to answer the questions to be able to submit your choice. But the key takeaway here is that Konami is clearly trying to gauge what fans want to see next.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>The choices presented in the survey are: </p>



<ul>
<li>Metal Gear</li>



<li>Metal Gear 2 Solid Snake</li>



<li>Metal Gear Solid</li>



<li>Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty</li>



<li>Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots</li>



<li>Metal Gear Solid: Peace Walker</li>



<li>Metal Gear Solid V: Ground Zeroes</li>



<li>Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain</li>



<li>Other (with a box to type in your selection)</li>
</ul>



<p>We know that there is more MGS on the horizon, if only through the coming release of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/metal-gear-solid-4-peace-walker-mgs5-references-found-in-metal-gear-solid-master-collection-files/">MGS: Master Collection Vol. 2</a>, which is said to include MGS4, MGS: Peace Walker, and MGSV. Those wouldn't be major remakes or touch-ups of the aforementioned titles, though; they'd be in line with the first volume of the Master Collection, which is, they'd just be a means of playing the series on modern hardware. Of course, there's a larger question around what this would mean for MGS4 due to it currently being marooned on PlayStation 3, but that's a whole different topic.</p>



<p> So far, the MGSD: Snake Eater remake has had a strong commercial start, <a href="https://wccftech.com/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-million-seller-day-one/">selling over 1 million copies in its first day,</a> according to Konami. It's also had a strong critical start, with players and critics (<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-ps5-review-based-on-a-hideo-kojima-game/">Wccftech included</a>) praising the remake for its efforts in updating what many consider to be one of the best stealth-action games out there.</p>



<p>From an external point of view, strong sales and critical reception should be exactly what Konami wanted out of the MGSD: Snake Eater remake, so why not move forward and pick another game in the series to repeat it with? Besides MGS2: Sons of Liberty, MGS3: Snake Eater was the riskiest game to remake, because it's the one that most of the series fans hold in higher regard than the rest.</p>



<p>Just like it did with <a href="https://wccftech.com/silent-hill-2-remake-sells-over-2-million-units-worldwide/">Silent Hill 2</a>, Konami got the most difficult one off the board first, and by all means, knocked it out of the park. There will be high expectations for whatever comes next, but at least we can have some confidence in what Konami is trying to do with the series.</p>



<p>So, which game would you pick to get the same treatment that MGS3 got next? Personally, I don't need any of them to get a remake, I'd just like to be able to play my beloved MGS4 without having to boot up my aging PS3.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Xbox has revealed that this year marks its "largest investment" in the Xbox Game Pass subscription service to date, so it's clear the company isn't too fazed by discussions around whether the service is good for developers or not.</p>

<p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/inside-xboxs-increasingly-vital-indie-publishing-operation" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Eurogamer</a>, Xbox indie boss Chris Charla confirms that 2025 has seen the biggest investment in Game Pass in the service's history, and he also reveals that Xbox has "signed deals with more than 150 partners to expand the catalog".</p>

<p>Charla says that "the majority" of studios whose games have been included as part of Game Pass "want to bring their future titles to the service", too, so the somewhat ambivalent buzz doesn't seem to be deterring developers who've got experience with the platform either.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/xbox-game-pass-largest-investment-there-are-no-ghosts-at-the-grand.jpg?itok=zEhnasiB 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/xbox-game-pass-largest-investment-there-are-no-ghosts-at-the-grand.jpg?itok=AxI2P82x 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Xbox Game Pass is attracting indie titles like the upcoming&nbsp;<em>There Are No Ghosts at the Grand</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>Xbox making its largest investment in Game Pass yet comes after a couple of high-profile industry figures expressed concern that the service might be doing more harm than good for developers, whether they be first-party or third-party studios.</p>

<p>Earlier this month, former Bethesda exec Pete Hines said subscription services were "worth jack shit" without companies making the effort to "figure out how to balance the needs of the service" with those who are "providing the content".</p>

<p>PlayStation boss Shawn Layden appeared to agree, linking Hines' comments on social media platform LinkedIn and asking whether subscription services were "healthy and helpful" for those who make games.</p>

<p>Layden's comments drew agreement <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xbox-game-pass-shannon-loftis-comments" rel="nofollow">from former Xbox VP Shannon Loftis</a>, who added that game adoption on Game Pass "comes at the expense of retail revenue" and that the service creates "weird inner tensions" among developers.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/human-fall-flat-xbox-game-pass_0.jpg?itok=xY9tfjwL 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/human-fall-flat-xbox-game-pass_0.jpg?itok=wGw6bsPt 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Game Pass hits like&nbsp;<em>Human: Fall Flat&nbsp;</em>haven't stopped some wondering whether the service is good for developers.</figcaption></figure><p>Whether or not Game Pass is actually good for developers is a question that's likely to continue to spark debate, but one thing's for sure: Xbox is still sure the service works. Stay tuned for more on this and all other things Game Pass-related.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>While reports are circulating that Disney-owned ABC and late-night talk show host Jimmy Kimmel are </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/jimmy-kimmel-fallon-colbert-stewart-trump-kirk-2000627249"><span>in talks to bring </span><i><span>Jimmy Kimmel Live</span></i></a> <span>back on air after the show was pulled last week, more high-profile names from some of Disney’s biggest franchises have spoken out in protest of the decision. While some, like Aunt May actor Marisa Tomei and She-Hulk actor Tatiana Maslany, have </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/jimmy-kimmel-abc-disney-boycott-marvel-marisa-tomei-2000627135"><span>called for a straight-up boycott</span></a><span> of the company’s services, some other major players in </span><i><span>Star Wars </span></i><span>and Marvel are simply voicing their support for Kimmel and condemning ABC and Disney’s decision.</span></p> <p><span>Mark Hamill, who has portrayed original </span><i><span>Star Wars </span></i><span>protagonist Luke Skywalker since long before Disney ever got its hands on the franchise, posted on Bluesky that he believes Jimmy Kimmel being pulled from the air in an effort to placate the FCC and the Trump administration will only embolden further attacks on free speech in America, and says that he finds Kimmel “very talented and funny.” This is in reference to comments from ex-Disney CEO Michael Eisner, who expressed similar sentiments </span><a href="https://x.com/Michael_Eisner/status/1969088566098870363"><span>on his X account</span></a><span> and signed off with the same final line.</span></p>   <p><span>Another big </span><i><span>Star Wars </span></i><span>name calling out Disney for this move is Dan Gilroy, a writer whose work on the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/andor-season-2-ending-vgchat-star-wars-rogue-one-10-12-1851780720"><span>Disney+ series </span><i><span>Andor</span></i></a><span> earned him an Emmy. Gilroy wrote a guest column on </span><a href="https://deadline.com/2025/09/andor-dan-gilroy-jimmy-kimmel-commentary-1236549627/"><i><span>Deadline</span></i></a><span> comparing the real-world actions of the Trump administration to events of the show, which focuses on the Galactic Empire’s tyrannical reign.</span></p>

 <p><span>“As one of the writers on the Disney+ drama </span><i><span>Andor</span></i><span>, we spent six years thinking about a fascist takeover of a galaxy far, far away,” Gilroy wrote. “Six years thinking about ordinary beings as an authoritarian regime comes in for the kill.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The Natural History Museum of London is getting a Pokémon pop-up shop experience beginning in early 2026. It’ll have exclusive stuff fans can’t get anywhere else. It’s intended to be part of Pokémon’s 30th anniversary celebration. Why does it seem destined to be yet <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-van-gogh-museum-scalpers-pikachu-card-1850882131">another scalper-infested mess</a>?</p> <p>Fans will need to register for a free ticket to visit the Pokémon x Natural History Museum pop-up store, which will run from 26 January 2026 until 22 March 2026. If you can’t make it to London yourself, the merchandise will be available to buy from the <a href="https://www.nhmshop.co.uk/?srsltid=AfmBOorBseC_DhtYXMqRbGzy3Zxn6ye5OvDqVzxM9dHraX54OsyrcOM7" target="_blank" rel="noopener">online Natural History Museum shop</a> as well, according to <a href="https://www.gamespress.com/en-GB/Go-wild-as-The-Pokemon-Company-International-and-Natural-History-Museu">today’s press release</a>. It’ll include clothing, stationery, accessories, prints, and a brand-new exclusive plush, all of which “are sure to delight fans of all ages.”</p> <p>“The Natural History Museum and Pokémon share a fascination for and focus on the natural world and its creatures, from their evolution to their environment,” reads a press release. “In the Pokémon world, Pokémon can evolve into many forms which allow them to adapt smoothly and perfectly to any environment. Meanwhile, the Natural History Museum’s halls take you on a journey through the evolution and diversity of life on planet earth, from prehistoric dinosaurs to the species we live alongside today.”</p>

 <p>While The Pokémon Company hasn’t teased exactly what the exclusive merch will be, it’s promising “products designed especially for the collaboration.” Whether that’s a fossil-centric approach to the franchise’s creatures or something else thematically appropriate remains to be seen. “Design inspiration has been drawn directly from the Natural History Museum’s iconic building and architecture, as well as the beautiful naturalist sketches that fill the Museum’s archives,” head of Pokémon Europe licensing Mathieu Galante said.</p>

 <p>It certainly can’t go any worse than what transpired in 2023 when Holland’s Van Gogh Museum had its own Pokémon pop-up shop. The frenzy of fans and the race to scalp products online for jacked-up prices left an unfortunate scar on the fandom’s collectors. Have things mellowed out two years later? Hardly. The <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-scalper-reseller-trading-card-van-gogh-pikachu-1850925900">steady growth of Pokémon market speculators</a> and the ongoing scarcity of what The Pokémon Company is able to get manufactured when it comes to cards, plushies, and other rare collectibles <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-plush-scalper-reseller-world-championships-2000618087">has left communities exhausted</a>.</p> <p>It’s not yet clear how The Pokémon Company<em>&nbsp;</em>plans to avoid similar issues with the Natural History Museum collaboration. Hopefully, it’s either produced enough stock to meet at least most of the demand, or found a way to limit what people can buy. The 30th anniversary of Pokémon begins February 27, 2026.</p>

                <p>Xbox boss Chris Charla, who runs Microsoft's independent gaming label ID@Xbox, has commented on the state of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-xbox-game-pass-games/2900-4001/" data-ref-id="2900-4001">Game Pass</a> and what developers are saying about it.</p><p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/inside-xboxs-increasingly-vital-indie-publishing-operation" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Speaking to Eurogamer</a>, Charla said Microsoft worked with more than 50 developers in 2024 to sign their first Game Pass deals, and 2025 marks ID@Xbox's "largest investment in Game Pass to date."</p><p>"We remain focused on delivering the most exciting and diverse catalogue in gaming," he said.</p><p>Charla went on to say that the majority of developers who have worked with ID@Xbox for a Game Pass deal have come back to Microsoft asking to bring future titles to the service.</p><p>"As a result, we've signed deals with more than 150 partners to expand the catalogue. We continue to engage with hundreds of partners each year to review upcoming titles," he said. You can see all the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/upcoming-game-pass-titles/1100-6534406/" data-ref-id="1100-6534406">upcoming Game Pass games</a> we know about for a look at what's confirmed.</p><p>As for how Microsoft finds games to bring to Game Pass via ID@Xbox, Charla said it can come from any number of sources, including meeting with developers at conferences or even a simple DM. It also comes from workplace conversations, Charla said. "We find them from people all around Microsoft being like, 'Hey, have you seen this game?' And we find them from having friends who make games who say, 'Hey, you need to see my friend's game.' And from people just emailing us!"</p><p>Charla did not, however, comment on the many recent comments from prominent developers about the possible negative effects of Game Pass on the wider gaming industry. Arkane co-founder Ralph Colantonio said Game Pass is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/arkane-co-founder-unloads-on-game-pass-calls-it-unsustainable/1100-6532991/" data-ref-id="1100-6532991">"unsustainable,"</a> while former PlayStation boss Shawn Layden said subscription services like Game Pass make developers become a <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/the-big-picture-part-one-i-dont-know-if-games-are-recession-proof" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">"wage slave."</a> Former Bethesda higher-up Pete Hines, meanwhile, said <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/former-bethesda-boss-pete-hines-has-strong-words-about-subscription-services-in-gaming/1100-6534511/" data-ref-id="1100-6534511">subscription services like Game Pass can lead to a "real problem" for the industry.</a> Take-Two boss Strauss Zelnick has said it <a href="https://google.com/search?q=strauss+zelnick+no+sense+game+pass+gamespot&amp;rlz=1C5GCCM_en&amp;oq=strauss+zelnick+no+sense+game+pass+gamespot&amp;gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUyBggAEEUYOTIJCAEQIRgKGKABMgkIAhAhGAoYoAEyCQgDECEYChigATIJCAQQIRgKGKABMgcIBRAhGKsC0gEINjUwOWowajeoAgCwAgA&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">makes no economic sense to put new games on Game Pass.</a> Shannon Loftis, a former executive at Xbox, said <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-downside-of-game-pass-according-to-a-former-xbox-boss/1100-6534539/" data-ref-id="1100-6534539">Game Pass eats into retail revenue.</a></p><p>Many others, meanwhile, have said Game Pass has had a major positive effect on their game releases. A top boss at the Football Manager studio said the being on subscription services has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/football-manager-player-numbers-are-through-the-roof-thanks-to-subscription-platforms-like-game-pass-and-netflix-series-boss-miles-jacobson-explains-how" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">led to skyrocketing player numbers.</a></p><p>Game Pass brought in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-game-pass-nearly-hit-5-billion-in-revenue-says-microsoft/1100-6533574/" data-ref-id="1100-6533574">nearly $5 billion in annual revenue</a> for the first time recently.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a> is launching a new Daft Punk Experience, but is adamant the robot rock duo aren't getting back together.</p>
<p>Unlike previous Fortnite concerts - from the likes of Marshmello, Travis Scott, and Ariana Grande - The Daft Punk Experience is instead a "fully interactive playground" in the Discover(y) mode, with multiple rooms in which to enjoy the music and lose yourself to dance.</p>
<p>That includes blasting robots with a soundwave laser in the Robot Rock Arena, remixing songs at Dream Chamber Studios, or making a Lego music video at Around the World. Some form of "afterparty" is also being teased, whatever da funk that might be.</p>
<p>"The band may be no longer, but their music lives on in Fortnite," reads a new blog post on the experience.</p>
<p>And to really hammer it home, the FAQ directly states: "The band is not getting back together". So no, you don't feel it coming - it's the end of the line.</p>
<p>It also states the experience won't feature any new music, as all songs have been previously released. Players will be able to make their own mashups though, but good luck making them harder, better, faster, or stronger.</p>
<p>The experience launches on 27th September at 2pm ET (that's 7pm UK time), but players are advised to join early. It will then be available "for a while" in Discover.</p>
<p>Of course, a Fortnite collaboration wouldn't be complete without a load of stuff to buy, either individually or as part of the Dark Punk Bundle. It includes song emotes, glittery outfits, and some adorable Lego characters so you too can be a Starboy, as well as other Jam Tracks including the duo's collaborations with The Weeknd.</p>

<p>Speaking of Lego, the first ever music-reactive build will be added to Fortnite - it's a lego pyramid that lights up when music is played.</p>
<p>Full details can be found on the <a href="https://www.fortnite.com/news/party-harder-better-faster-stronger-in-fortnite-with-the-daft-punk-experience">Fortnite blog</a>, so you can read up on the experience one more time.</p>
<p>Last week, Epic announced it would be giving Fortnite creators some more digital love by allowing them to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnite-creators-will-soon-be-able-to-sell-in-game-items-to-make-more-money-but-are-creative-mode-offerings-like-steal-a-brainrot-what-players-want">sell in-game items on their created islands</a>.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/perfect-dark-reboot-gameplay-details-concept-art-leak-xbox-microsoft/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/gameplay-details-and-concept-art-for-xbox%E2%80%99s-cancelled-perfect-dark-reboot-have-leaked.1304337/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>New details regarding Xbox's cancelled Perfect Dark reboot have leaked online through a report on <a href="https://mp1st.com/news/gameplay-details-concept-screens-cancelled-perfect-dark-reboot">MP1st</a>, giving us a little more of an idea of what this game might have tried with its gameplay mechanics, the opportunity its developer The Initiative and Microsoft saw with it, and a few pieces of concept art.</p>



<p>When Microsoft announced that Perfect Dark was going to be the debut game for its new "<em>AAAA</em>" studio, The Initiative in <a href="https://wccftech.com/perfect-dark-xbox-series-x-s-microsoft-game-awards-2020/">2020</a>, even if there was a sense that it was announced far too early, there was a buzz of excitement from fans. Jump ahead five years, and not only is the <a href="https://wccftech.com/perfect-dark-cancelled-the-initiative-shut-down-microsoft-layoffs/">Perfect Dark reboot cancelled, but The Initiative is gone</a>, with the studio and its would-be debut game being one of the many major casualties from Microsoft's <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-layoffs-funding-increased-spending-ai-infrastructure/">massive 9,000+ layoff</a> this past July.</p>



<p>Before any of that happened, per MP1st's sources, Microsoft saw bringing back Perfect Dark as a chance to take advantage of the fact that two other major videogame secret agent-types were missing from the industry, namely 007 and Solid Snake. Of course, that's no longer the case, with <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-ps5-review-based-on-a-hideo-kojima-game/">Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</a> putting the MGS series firmly back in players' minds and IO Interactive working up to its <a href="https://wccftech.com/007-first-light-uncharted-x-hitman-qa-narrative-drives-things/">007 First Light</a> release, but back in 2020, both series had been absent from gaming for some time.</p>



<p>Gameplay-wise, the documentation mentions three concepts called the Relentless System, the Reward System, and the Adrenaline System, though only the last of those three were detailed in the documents.</p>



<p>The Adrenaline system would have let players slow down time to dodge incoming bullets, line up their own shots, and move faster than surrounding enemies. It would also have let Joanna Dark do more damage to enemies, heal more, and reduce damage taken.</p>



<figure><figcaption>A piece of concept art from the cancelled Perfect Dark reboot via a report from MP1st.</figcaption></figure>



<p>There's also mention of a vertical slice that would have consisted of "<em>Season 1</em>" for the game, which gives some weight to rumors that the game would have had an episodic-style release, though at this point, who can say if they would have definitively gone that route.</p>



<p>Overall, to say it's unfortunate that this game never came to pass is an understatement, especially since it was <a href="https://wccftech.com/perfect-dark-nearly-saved-take-two-deal-fell-through/">almost saved after Microsoft dropped the ball</a>. Yes, Joanna Dark no longer would have had the open window previously granted due to the absence of MGS and 007, but I doubt that anyone would have minded having three great modern stealth-action games to play. </p>



<p>Just <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-initiative-studio-head-leaves-xbox-feels-pride-perfect-dark-remake/">last week</a>, former studio head of The Initiative, Darrell Gallagher, left Xbox, and said he "<em></em><em>couldn’t be prouder of the talented and passionate team I had the privilege assemble and lead</em>."</p>



<p>"<em>I leave with nothing but pride in what we accomplished together and excitement for what’s next — both for myself and for the amazing developers I was fortunate enough to work with.</em>"</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The Galaxy Buds 3 FE are a more affordable option to the their Buds 3 Pro counterpart, but what’s the real difference? first up is the drivers. The FE model employ just one 11mm driver in each earbud. With the Pro model, you get a dual-driver setup combining a 10.5mm dynamic driver with a 6.5 planar magnetic driver on each side. So as one would expect, you’ll get better sound on the Buds 3 Pro, but that’s not to say the FE model sound won’t be good.</p>
<p>Both sets of earbuds support active noise cancellation, but that on the Galaxy Buds 3 Pro is more robust—allowing you to fine tune the ANC strength based on environmental factors.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4219/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>SmartTag 2 Included</h2>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4219/">So if those aren’t deal breakers for you, you might as well save some cash. Plus, right now, Amazon is offering the Buds 3 FE for $30 off.</a> The price comes down from $180 to just $150, but that’s not all. Samsung is throwing in a SmartTag 2 free of charge when you order a pair.</p>
<p>These Samsung SmartTags can be a real life saver. We all know how Find My Phone functionality works. If you ever leave your phone behind, it’s not lost forever. You can pinpoint it’s exact location no matter where you are. Well, SmartTags brings that ability to anything you own. Stick it in your wallet or purse so you can always remember where you last set it down. Heck, you can even leave one in your glove compartment so you can always recall what block your parked your car on.</p>



<p>Back to the Galaxy Buds 3 FE, you’re getting a reliable set of earbuds without breaking the bank. This generation Samsung earbuds has an improved design and fit from the previous models. The rounded ear tips help keep them securely in place as you listen all day long.</p>
<p>With ANC turned off, you’ll get up to 8.5 hours of uninterrupted listening time on the earbuds alone. When you add in the charging case’s battery, you can receive up to 30 hours of playtime total.</p>
<p>Connect your Galaxy Buds 3 FE to your multiple devices at once. You can effortlessly switch between your phone, tablet, and PC as your needs change. You could be watching a video on your laptop when a call comes in. Answer it and have the audio come through your earbuds without changing a thing.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4219/">This deal is only available through September 28, so make moves on it while you can.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Like lots of canceled games, the more I hear about <em>Perfect Dark</em>, the cooler it sounds. Also is Tom Holland okay? And which Metal Gear should get the Unreal Engine 5 glow-up next? Face the new week with the latest edition of <em>Kotaku</em>‘s <a href="https://kotaku.com/tag/morning-checkpoint">Morning Checkpoint</a> at your side. The daily roundup of gaming news and culture breezes you through some of the biggest headlines going around. I stayed up until 3 a.m. this morning reviewing video games because it’s that time of year. I’m very tired but not too tired to contemplate which movies would <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/thegaychingy.bsky.social/post/3lze5vfxclk2q">make Carl’s top five in the Criterion closet</a>.</p> <h2>Some more <em>Perfect Dark</em> reboot details leak</h2> <p>Microsoft’s canceled Xbox exclusive <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-reportedly-cancels-that-cool-looking-perfect-dark-1851785531">might have been originally planned</a> as an episodic release. That’s according to a new <a href="https://mp1st.com/news/gameplay-details-concept-screens-cancelled-perfect-dark-reboot">report by<em> MP1st</em></a>. If accurate, that might have made the espionage shooter’s rollout similar to that of <em>Hitman</em> (2016). According to leaked development materials reviewed by the website, The Initiative and Crystal Dynamics were working on the game’s first robust vertical slice right up until it was canceled this summer.</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Perfect Dark | Gameplay Details and Concept Art</p> <p>According to the report, as of April this year, The Initiative was still working on the game's Vertical Slice 1.<a href="https://t.co/mSBXCnflwP">https://t.co/mSBXCnflwP</a> <a href="https://t.co/ToSZNR4dKP">pic.twitter.com/ToSZNR4dKP</a></p> <p>— Klobrille (@klobrille) <a href="https://twitter.com/klobrille/status/1969845612549202200?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 21, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>The report also details a planned Adrenaline System which would be a resource that let players pull off <a href="https://kotaku.com/perfect-dark-xbox-showcase-gameplay-1851528864"><em>Matrix</em>-like abilities</a> ranging from healing and increased damage to slowing down time for aiming and dodging bullets. Leaked concept art points to an “Eco Sci-Fi” version of Cairo, the setting of an early teaser, as being one of the locations to ship in the first episode of the game. <a href="https://kotaku.com/perfect-dark-canceled-take-two-embracer-xbox-crystal-dynamics-2000622400"><em>Bloomberg</em> recently reported</a> that 2K Games was looking to takeover publishing but couldn’t work out a deal with Microsoft and Embracer over rights to the IP.</p>

 <h2>Tom Holland rushed to hospital after botched <em>Spider-Man</em> movie stunt</h2> <p>Tom Holland has been doing <a href="https://kotaku.com/spider-man-brand-new-day-4-mcu-suit-tom-holland-set-2000616006">cool stunts</a> in London while filming <i>Spider-Man: Brand New Day</i>, Unfortunately at least one of them didn’t go as planned and he’s now recovering. “We were called at 10.30am on Friday to attend to a patient who had sustained an injury at Leavesden Studios in Watford,” an East of England Ambulance Service spokesman told <a href="https://www.thesun.co.uk/tv/36792761/tom-holland-hospital-spider-man-stunt/"><em>The Sun</em></a> yesterday. “An ambulance was sent to the scene, and the patient was transported to hospital for further care.”</p>

 <p><a href="https://deadline.com/2025/09/tom-holland-hospitalized-spider-man-brand-new-day-1236552019/">According to <em>Deadline</em></a>, Holland suffered a concussion and filming has been paused for a couple of days as a precaution. Hopefully, he can make a speedy recovery even with out the real Spidey’s mutant super healing.</p> <h2>Which <em>Metal Gear Solid</em> should get the remake treatment next?</h2> <p>A poll has been recently <a href="https://x.com/MGSMGN/status/1969354623007014979/photo/2">shared on X</a> which looks to be one Konami intends to send out after a <em>Metal Gear</em>-focused livestream later this week from TGS. The poll asks fans which other <em>Metal Gear </em>games they’d like to see remade, following the recent release of <em>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</em>. <em>MGS 2: Sons of Liberty</em> is the obvious choice, though I could see the case for <em>Metal Gear Solid</em> as well.<em> Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots</em>, meanwhile, remains trapped on PS3, though fans suspect the <em>Master Collection Vol. 2</em>, whenever it’s ready, will finally port it to modern consoles.</p>

 <h2><em>Nintendo vs. Palworld</em> is currently a debate about mods</h2> <p><a href="https://gamesfray.com/gross-in-palworld-patent-case-nintendo-tells-japanese-judge-mods-should-not-count-as-prior-art-because-they-cant-run-without-underlying-games/">According to <em>Games Fray</em></a>, part of Pocket Pair’s defense in Nintendo’s patent lawsuit is that certain mechanics Nintendo claims as its own were already in use in other games, including versions modded by players. Nintendo is reportedly arguing that mods don’t count as “prior art” because they can’t exist or run separate from the game’s they were made for.</p>

 <h2><em>Dying Light: The Beast</em> nerfs nudity in Japan</h2> <p>The open-world zombie adventure is reportedly censoring certain depictions in Japan. The tweaks include changes to female zombies and the removal of all nudity, according to <a href="https://www.gamespark.jp/article/2025/09/19/157365.html"><em>Game Spark</em></a> (via<a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/dying-light-the-beast-is-the-latest-game-to-be-censored-in-japan/"><em> VGC</em></a>). “These changes have resulted in an overall tone down on violent scenes, while still allowing Japanese players to enjoy seamless co-op play with friends playing the overseas version.”</p>

 <h2><em>Tomb Raider</em> remaster patches out AI voice performance changes</h2> <p>The French version of <em>Tomb Raider 4-6 Remastered</em> <a href="https://kotaku.com/lara-croft-tomb-raider-francoise-cadol-aspyr-remaster-2000624934">was accused</a> of using AI to alter an actor’s performance. Those accusations appear to have been well-founded now, because Aspyr has gone and removed the AI alterations from the game. “We’ve addressed this issue by removing all AI voiceover content, while retaining the improvements made in the previous update,” the studio <a href="https://support.aspyr.com/hc/en-us/articles/39710879443853-Tomb-Raider-IV-VI-Remastered-Hotfix-for-Patch-2">wrote announcing a surprise hotfix update</a> (via <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/tomb-raider-lara-croft-lawsuit-aspyr-patch/"><em>The Gamer</em></a>). “We apologize for any inconvenience this may have caused. Please reach out to our customer support site with any issues.”</p> <h2>ICYMI:</h2> <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/borderlands-4-the-kotaku-review-bugs-pc-performance-ending-gearbox-ps5-2000627149">Our big <em>Borderlands 4</em> review is here</a></p> <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/sonic-racing-crossworlds-rival-shadow-vector-cream-vanilla-2000627156"><em>Sonic Racing: Crossworlds</em> might be better than <em>Mario Kart World</em></a></p> <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/the-match-3-rpg-that-started-it-all-is-back-and-we-talk-to-its-legendary-creator-2000626834">The mastermind behind one of the best puzzle games ever talks about trying to bring back a classic</a></p> <h2>Watch this:</h2>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">"I wish I could shield them all from the sweats and bigots."</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a> Delulu, the game's new battle royale mode with proximity voice chat, has launched to big player numbers but also a surge of complaints around in-game abuse — prompting Epic Games to issue "thousands" of bans.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Delulu enjoyed a concurrent peak of 126,553 players after its launch this past weekend, enough to make it one of Fortnite's most popular modes over the period.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Set on the game's main battle royale map, Delulu sprinkles players evenly across its surface and allows them to team up and chat with anyone in their vicinity. Gameplay-wise, the mode is based around the new ability to form drop-in, drop-out squads (which have friendly fire disabled), while the ability to talk with others adds a fresh layer of social interactivity, as players encounter others and try to work out who's friendly — and who's not. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Experiences of the mode are wildly mixed, as is perhaps to be expected when dealing with something that relies entirely on the online behavior of others. Some have praised the positive experiences they've encountered while playing, but many have highlighted the frequent use of hate speech and slurs, and the targeting of players because of their accent, their age or because they're a woman.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Reddit is awash with players trying Delulu and reporting back with their experiences and it's a mixed bag. In a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/1nmom8n/my_fellow_ladies_hows_delulu/?share_id=mVMbddjLxTuF5MU4jyEio" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">thread</a> titled "My fellow ladies: How's Delulu," a woman asks others for their take. The responses detail a list of sexist comments that some women have received, though others state they had more positive experiences. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"It's been terrible for me so far," wrote Forever_Winter13. "I've been playing solo and there hasn't been one game where I haven't been told horrendous things I don't wish to repeat. I just want to have fun and enjoy the game."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"For the most part, it's been completely fine," wrote Glitter_Fox_. "But there was one group of guys who kept appearing in the same lobbies as me that would purposely hunt down any female voice they heard. They literally would yell 'equality' as they shoot you."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Just as bad for guys," countered PlayfulBus8433. "Every French kid and his mother asks you to call him daddy or they will kill you."</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">We Build the LEGO Fortnite Mecha Team Leader</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In another <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/1nmq893/fortnite_delulu_mode_on_middle_east_server_is_a/?share_id=1FpegS2QRPZXbwjdZhhGo" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">thread</a>, a player on Fortnite's Middle East server highlighted their experience of "rampant" racism and discrimination attempting to play as an Indian in lobbies mostly filled by those speaking other languages. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"It's like a language gatekeeping squad rolled into a battle royale," wrote KatsukiNEO. "Worse, I’ve heard racist slurs thrown around casually. Proximity chat has turned into a tool for discrimination instead of fun."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Can't go a single game on EU [Fortnite's European server] without hearing at least three different people spamming the N-word," replied CareRarely.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Notably, before the weekend was out, Fortnite developer Epic Games <a href="https://x.com/FortniteStatus/status/1969845572325494908" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted</a> to remind players to "remember to report voice chat behavior in-game that violates our community rules. This gives us evidence to quickly take action against rule breakers." The post highlighted the game's relatively straightforward method of quickly reporting a conversation they've heard, and stated that the company was working on the matter, with "thousands banned already this weekend."</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><div data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Remember to report voice chat behavior in-game that violates our community rules. This gives us evidence to quickly take action against rule breakers.</p><p>👉 Open the Sidebar and go to the Voice Chat tab<br>🎙️ Choose ‘Report Conversation’<br>📩 On the next screen hit ‘Submit’</p><p>Thousands… <a href="https://t.co/Bin5GaqRRV" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/Bin5GaqRRV</a></p></div>— Fortnite Status (@FortniteStatus) <a href="https://twitter.com/FortniteStatus/status/1969845572325494908?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">September 21, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Amid the toxicity, however, other players reported having a better time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I have some anxiety with talking to people online that I was expecting the worst out of this game mode," wrote SpadesofDarkness, in a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/1nn4suo/delulu_changed_fortnite/?share_id=9IwBgwCoGbZfUYUY5ueRu" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reddit</a> post full of more positive experiences. "But man, this is genuinely some of the most fun I’ve had in Fortnite. While I definitely have seen a couple of people spamming the N-word, a majority of the people I've met have either been really chill or just a hoot to talk to."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I had so much fun this weekend," added meemii8. "My highlights were me running across the map to meet my son and getting shot at by a group. When I shouted 'no, no I'm just trying to find my son let me go,' one of them said 'wait, wait hold up, stop shooting.' They let me join them and said they'd help look and we went on a Finding Nemo-style hunt across the map looking for him and calling out for him amongst the groups. We found him haha. Also getting to the end and letting a little kid on our team get the umbrella, hearing him so happy made my day."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"There are so many sweet kids in this mode," concluded racdcp. "I wish I could shield them all from the sweats and bigots."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Epic Games is yet to announce whether Delulu will become a permanent Fortnite offering, and will likely be looking over the feedback from this weekend as the game mode goes offline — for now. Delulu is next set to go live during the coming weekend — it'll be interesting to see if the continued bans (and visible threat of action) will have any impact on player behavior.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Trophies for an unannounced Tomb Raider: Anniversary PS4 port have popped up online.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While this may not sound too surprising given we've had a bunch of classic Tomb Raider games remastered recently — <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/tomb-raider-i-iii-remastered"><u>Tomb Raider I-III Remastered</u></a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/tomb-raider-iv-vi-remastered"><u>IV-VI Remastered collections</u></a> released in February 2024 and 2025, respectively — it looks like this may be a port rather than a remaster.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">How do we know that? Well, we don't for sure, but the trophies — which can be seen on PlayStation trophy tracking site <a href="https://www.truetrophies.com/game/Tomb-Raider-Anniversary/trophies" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>True Trophies</u></a> — are limited, and the images are, too, which suggests this is a port coming to something like the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/playlist/igneditorial/lists/playstation-plus-premium-tier-games"><u>PlayStation Plus game catalog </u></a>rather than a full-on remake.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">As Redditor VeldinX explained on their thread "<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/TombRaider/comments/1nmlwuc/anniversary_leaked_for_ps4/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Anniversary leaked for PS4</u></a>," "the style of this leaked list tracks with other games released for Sony’s classics catalogue, e.g. the small number of trophies and the design of the images. If it were Saber’s remaster, it would likely have a large, expansive list of things to do, and the images would be in the same style as TR1-6 were."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Of course, this doesn't mean that the team that's been remastering the retro games, Aspyr, isn't also working on a new collection of classics that include Tomb Raider: Anniversary — it only suggests that these particular trophies are for a different game. Either way, we should expect clarification from either Sony or Aspyr soon. Watch this space.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Tomb Raider: Anniversary is the 2007 action-adventure game developed by Crystal Dynamics, now owned by Embracer, and published by the defunct Eidos Interactive in 2007 for PC, PlayStation 2, Xbox 360, PlayStation Portable, Wii and mobile phones. It is the eighth overall entry in the Tomb Raider series and THE second in the Legend trilogy.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Vikki Blake is a reporter for IGN, as well as a critic, columnist, and consultant with 15+ years experience working with some of the world's biggest gaming sites and publications.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/disney-panics-and-releases-the-first-mandalorian-and-grogu-star-wars-trailer.1304283/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <div> <p>Chrome Boba Fett and the little baby Yoda are here to help you forget all about Disney’s complicity in <a href="https://kotaku.com/jimmy-kimmel-fallon-colbert-stewart-trump-kirk-2000627249">a grim attack on free speech</a>. Out in less than nine months, <em>The Mandalorian and Grogu&nbsp;</em>now has its first trailer, and the next<em> Star Wars</em> movie looks both incredibly unnecessary and also lots of fun.</p> </div>  <p>The film stars Pedro Pascal as the Mandalorian bounty hunter, with his Force-sensitive sidekick Grogu looking as adorable as ever. Set after the TV series, the film finds the pair back in the galactic hotseat, navigating post-war tensions between the New Republic (Sigourney Weaver plays a colonel named Ward) and remnants of the Empire (Jonny Coyne plays an imperial warlord). Also Jabba the Hutt’s son Rotta is in the mix too.</p>  <p>Here’s a brief look:</p>   <p>And here’s the official synopsis:</p> <blockquote><p>The evil Empire has fallen, and Imperial warlords remain scattered throughout the galaxy. As the fledgling New Republic works to protect everything the Rebellion fought for, they have enlisted the help of legendary Mandalorian bounty hunter Din Djarin and his young apprentice Grogu.</p></blockquote> <p>The whole 90 seconds flashes by in an instant, but in addition to the aforementioned characters you can also catch a glimpse of some alien guy messing people up with an electrostaff and Grogu speeding around with some other cute god-knows-whats (paging <em>Star Wars</em> lore master Zack Zwiezen). But like I said at the top, it looks fun and not mired down in a bunch of <em>Star Wars</em> naval-gazing mythbuilding, which is a good a thing.</p> <p><em>The Mandalorian and Grogu </em>is directed by Jon Favreau and co-written by Favreau and Dave Filoni, and marks the first in a fresh slate of upcoming<em> Star Wars</em> movies for Disney. With everything else, including a new Jedi-centric tale with <a href="https://kotaku.com/star-wars-new-jedi-order-writer-replaced-rey-delayed-1851747797">Daisy Ridley returning as Rey completely MIA</a>, it’ll either feel like the start of something new or the death knell for the current streaming-wars-burnout incarnation of the franchise. The movie hits theaters on May 22, 2026, and can’t come soon enough for a <a href="https://kotaku.com/jimmy-kimmel-abc-disney-boycott-marvel-marisa-tomei-2000627135">company currently facing a boycott</a> from fans and celebrities over the Jimmy Kimmel controversy.</p> <p><em>Update 9/22/2025 10:35 a.m. ET: added more story details.</em></p>
