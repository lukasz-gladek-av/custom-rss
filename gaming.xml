<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2024/08/looks-like-classic-puzzler-boulder-dash-is-getting-a-40th-anniversary-re-release">We reported back last year</a> on the existence of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/boulder_dash_40th_anniversary">Boulder Dash 40th Anniversary</a>, and now we know that the game will launch on <strong>July 24th</strong> for Switch, and it'll only set you back £19.99/$19.99. Heck, this time you can even have a gander at how it all looks in motion in the above gameplay vid. Result!</p>
<p>Yes, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/arcade/boulder_dash">Boulder Dash</a>, which was first released all the way back in 1984 (when this writer was already busting heads in the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gba/bruce_lee_return_of_the_legend">Bruce Lee</a> game on his trusty C64), has seen a few re-releases before, including on its <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/boulder_dash_30th_anniversary">30th anniversary</a>, but this time it seems there are a few more changes to the classic formula, including a level editor for sharing your own creations online.</p><p><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><a id="yt-2" title="Play" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA"></a><figcaption>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>821k</span></a></figcaption><figcaption><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></figcaption></figure></p>
<p>According to the game's official press release, this new effort features "Brand New Levels, New Design, New Challenges, New Worlds, Plus More!" That does sound exciting, to be fair.</p>
<p>With 180 levels to blast through in total, and with Rockford returning to his role as chief...eh...smasher of rocks (alongside what appears to be a few other selectable characters) this certainly looks the business, and although the art style is almost alarmingly crisp, it <em>does</em> harken back to the OG, and it looks as th</p>

<p>It seems as though the devs have been more than diligent too, with Boulder Dash world champions invited to play the game and Boulder Dashes 1, 2 and 3 all in the mix within this one revamp, as BBG explains;</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“We pursued two goals: Firstly, we wanted to bring the first three parts Boulder Dash I, II and III to life as faithfully as possible on current machines. Secondly, we wanted to spice up the classic gameplay with contemporary visuals and suitable new ideas such as growing walls, slime, an enemy generator, eggs and other things.<br>
<em>On top we have integrated a level editor which allows the users to create, play and share all these levels to Boulder Dash players worldwide</em>..."</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>In the OG Boulder Dash games, as is the case here, your task is to open the exit on each screen, which sounds simple but is in fact an engrossing mix of puzzling, dodging and timing your moves to deal with foes. It was a revelation back in the day and, with the right treatment, the gameplay here should stand the test of time well.</p>

<p>Otherwise, leave you with a "fact's attack" from the press release and some screens to satiate long-time Boulder Dash fans in the meantime.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>- 6 new, never-before-seen worlds<br>
- 3 new worlds created by hardcore the fans<br>
- 180 completely new, balanced, and refined levels<br>
- Variety of new and unique items, including growing walls, slime, enemy generator, eggs, plus more<br>
- Construction kit to create, share, or download other players’ levels<br>
- Distinctive visual style that aims to blend original color schemes with contemporary themes<br>
- Option to select and play for one of the three main heroes, each crafted in line with the game’s original vision<br>
- Music and sounds composed by Germany’s most famous video game musician Chris Huelsbeck (Giana Sisters, Turrican, Star Wars Rogue Squadron, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Splintered Fate and many more).</p>

			<p>The launch for Build A Rocket Boy's debut game, MindsEye, hasn't exactly gone the way the studio would have hoped. The simple fact that PlayStation, a company that very rarely gives players refunds for purchases on the PS Store, <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-is-giving-players-refunds-for-mindseye/">is giving players refunds for their purchases of MindsEye</a>&nbsp;says a lot about how things are going on its own.</p>
<p>Shortly after players started to publicly announce they had gotten refunds from PlayStation, and as more videos of bugs and long statements from players appear on the game's <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MindsEye/">Reddit,</a> developer Build A Rocket Boy released a <a href="https://x.com/MindsEyeGame/status/1933167455238594939">statement to the game's official X account</a>, saying that the team is "<em>heartbroken that not every player was able to experience the game as we intended</em>."</p>
<p>The studio also pinned the issues the game is having on a memory leak, claiming that "<em>roughly 1 in 10 of our players</em>" were impacted by this issue, and that a hotfix has been made to fix the problem. That fix, along with a few more that Build A Rocket Boy detailed in its statement, will be pushed to players starting tomorrow, with more fixes to come throughout the weekend, continuing on through next week, and basically through the rest of the month.</p>
<p>"<em>We are fully committed to ensuring all our players have a great experience, and we will continue to provide frequent and transparent updates</em>," the studio continued in its statement. "<em>We will do our best to respond to all your comments and feedback. Thank you for playing MindsEye. Thank you for your understanding and continued support - it truly means the world to us. We're grateful and blessed to have you on the journey with us</em>."</p>
<p>For this weekend, Build A Rocket Boy says the first hotfix for MindsEye will include:</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/notepad-microsoft-newsletter/686101/microsoft-xbox-next-gen-console-handheld-hints-notepad<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>I feel like a broken record, but I’ve been writing for <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/18/24123318/microsoft-next-xbox-pc-future">more than a year</a> that the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/notepad-microsoft-newsletter/612105/microsoft-next-gen-xbox-platform-changes-notepad">next Xbox console</a> will be more <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/9/24339889/microsoft-xbox-handheld-windows-operating-system-changes-notepad">PC-like</a>. Now, I think Microsoft just teased its next-gen Xbox plans while announcing its partnership with Asus to bring <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/682009/microsoft-asus-rog-xbox-ally-devices-new-windows-xbox-experience">two Xbox Ally handhelds</a> to the market later this year.</p><p>The Xbox Ally handhelds run Windows, but the Xbox team has worked with Windows engineers to boot these PC handhelds <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/682011/microsoft-windows-xbox-pc-combination-features-rog-xbox-ally-devices?preview=true&amp;vm_preview=fa9278b54dcc70a82977039c0c8c6fb8">into a full-screen Xbox UI</a>. The Windows desktop doesn’t even fully load, and you use the Xbox app UI as a launcher to get to all your games (even Steam titles) and apps like Discord.</p><p>While the combination of Windows and Xbox here is intriguing, it’s the way that Microsoft is positioning these devices that really caught my attention. “This is an Xbox,” said Microsoft during the reveal, clearly expanding its <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/14/24296420/microsoft-this-is-an-xbox-marketing-campaign-xbox-everywhere">marketing push</a> beyond a single console to every screen and device.</p><p>It all felt like a true Xbox handheld reveal. There was even an 11-minute-long <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOKm9dDOSC8">behind-the-scenes video</a> on the Xbox Ally handhelds, filmed in a similar style to Microsoft’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F1dRgWpGePs">“Project Scorpio” Xbox One X reveal</a> from nearly nine years ago. “This is a breakthrough moment for Xbox,” <strong>Carl Ledbetter</strong>, a 30-year Microsoft design veteran, says in the video. Ledbetter helped design the original IntelliMouse, the Xbox 360 Slim, the Xbox One X, and plenty of other Microsoft devices. When Ledbetter is involved, you know it’s more than just a simple partner project with Asus.</p><p>“For the first time, a player is going to be able to hold the power of the Xbox experience in their hand, and take it with them anywhere they want to go,” says Xbox president <strong>Sarah Bond</strong>, in the same video. Microsoft thinks of the Xbox Ally handhelds as Xbox consoles with the freedom of Windows, and I think the next-gen Xbox is going to look very similar as a result.</p><p>Microsoft’s own Xbox handheld <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/exclusive-xboxs-handheld-pembrooke-has-been-sidelined-for-now-as-microsoft-doubles-down-on-windows-11-pc-gaming-handheld-optimization">was reportedly</a> “sidelined” recently, and I’ve heard from insiders that it’s essentially canceled as the company focuses on Xbox’s new software platform. I still think we’ll see next-gen Xbox hardware from Microsoft, but I also strongly believe we’ll see multiple devices from PC makers like Asus that will also be considered next-gen Xbox consoles.</p><p>That’s because the next-gen Xbox platform is being built in the open, with devices like the ROG Xbox Ally and Xbox Ally X. These handhelds seem like a market test for where Microsoft goes next with the combination of Windows and Xbox, and the company’s goal to turn any screen into an Xbox.</p><p>Microsoft Gaming CEO <strong>Phil Spencer</strong> made it clear in an <a href="https://youtu.be/mw26FdfkUDM">Xbox podcast</a> earlier this week that the Windows and Xbox teams are working more closely than ever. He also revealed this is to make the PC gaming experience more console-like:</p><div><blockquote><p><em>This is the tightest collaboration I’ve seen between the gaming organization and the Windows team in my three decades at the company. For 25 years, almost, we’ve been working on a console experience where you turn it on and it works and your games are there, and how do we bring that to the Windows ecosystem so you get the freedom of Windows to use the storefronts and the apps you want to use, but it feels like a device that’s purpose-built.</em></p></blockquote></div><p>There are plenty of technical challenges on the Windows side to fix, but these new Xbox Ally handheld devices also demonstrate a challenge for Microsoft: it’s about to sell an “Xbox handheld” that won’t run most Xbox console games natively. I’ve seen plenty of hands-on YouTube videos claiming this is a true “Xbox handheld,” but very few make it clear that it’s actually only natively running PC games.</p><p>Microsoft’s Xbox Play Anywhere effort lets you buy an Xbox game and get the PC version, but only a small amount of Xbox games and publishers are currently part of this. This isn’t an issue for Microsoft’s own first-party Xbox games, as they’ve been publishing to PC for years now, but upcoming games like <em>Grand Theft Auto VI</em> won’t run on these Xbox handhelds. You’ll have to stream <em>Grand Theft Auto VI</em> instead, until the PC version, which hasn’t been announced yet, is released.</p><p>I think most consumers won’t even realize this is the case as Microsoft is already heavily marketing these handhelds as Xboxes. Xbox fans were going wild <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZLEflHcy8bU">during a watch party</a>, but as soon as the ROG logo appeared the room got a lot more subdued. This highlights Microsoft’s brand challenges here and why Xbox fans are cautious when it comes to the complexity of a PC and the future of their game library. Either way, the real benefit of Microsoft’s approach is access to Steam PC games and even PlayStation PC titles on “Xbox handhelds,” so Microsoft should lean into that selling point initially.</p><p>Over the long term, I think Microsoft will eventually solve this challenge through emulation. Bond created a new team focused on game preservation and forward compatibility in early 2024, but there are technical and licensing hurdles to overcome before original Xbox, Xbox 360, and modern Xbox games can run emulated on a PC.</p><p>Until Microsoft is ready with emulation, it’s filling the gaps with Xbox Play Anywhere and Xbox Cloud Gaming streaming instead. Microsoft’s Xbox app on PC will simply show your recently played games, and then you can just play them — whether it’s natively or streaming through the cloud. Microsoft has already done all the important work for cloud saves, so this makes the experience a lot more seamless.</p><p>All of this work is moving in a direction that Microsoft keeps talking about: choice. Instead of buying one Xbox console from Microsoft, what if you could buy Xbox consoles from lots of PC makers without ever having to see the complexity of Windows?</p><p>Microsoft is going to change the next generation of game consoles if it can pull this off. The company is already opening up its Xbox PC app to list Steam games, so having the ability to run <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/633478/microsoft-xbox-steam-games-support-ui">Steam games on next-gen Xbox</a> consoles doesn’t feel all that far-fetched anymore. </p><p>I don’t think Microsoft is doing a bunch of Windows and Xbox work just to have this software running on handhelds. I think this work will give Microsoft the ability to control the console-like experience and UI on a variety of hardware, in a way where it can upsell Game Pass, its own Xbox PC games, and more. Microsoft is already in a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/15/24221036/microsoft-xbox-handheld-pc-gaming-valve-steamos">handheld gaming PC race</a> against Valve and SteamOS, but that’s a smaller battle in the war to define the next generation of video game consoles. </p><p>As I’ve written plenty of times before, the key to this next-gen Xbox platform will be Microsoft’s execution. It has everything it needs to make this approach a success, but Microsoft’s focus on gaming on Windows has been disastrous in the past. With the Windows and Xbox teams now working together more closely than ever before, it’s make or break time for a new Xbox platform that looks like it’s going to extend far beyond the confines of a handheld PC.</p><div><p id="the-pad"><h2>The pad:</h2></p></div><div><ul><li><span><strong>You can now try Microsoft’s new Start menu for Windows 11. </strong>Microsoft is now allowing Windows 11 testers to try out a new, larger Start menu that includes a scrollable interface, new views, and more customization.

One report suggests that the move out of Seattle could have been related to attendee experiences in downtown Seattle.

This new “enhanced search” feature lets you find websites in your browser history even if you use a phrase, synonym, or even a typo that’s similar to the site you actually want to find. This feature is opt-in and uses an on-device model to train on browsing history data “which never leaves your device and is never sent to Microsoft.” This seems like less of a privacy risk than Microsoft’s Recall feature, and you don’t have to worry about snapshots of your screen being stored in a local database, either.</span></li><li><span><strong>Microsoft and Asus’ two new Xbox Ally handhelds are coming later this year</strong>.

Some games were making Windows BSOD, but Microsoft notes that its June update wasn’t available for PCs with Easy Anti-Cheat installed, so only a small number of people will have installed the update and then installed an incompatible game afterward. Either way, it’s all fixed now with an additional update.</span></li><li><span><strong>Did Microsoft just tease a Halo CE remaster? </strong>Regular Notepad readers will know I teased a <em>Halo CE</em> remaster <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/6/24172684/microsoft-xbox-showcase-2024">last year</a>, and Xbox chief Phil Spencer appears to have confirmed that it’s on the way. At the end of the Xbox Games Showcase, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/682493/did-microsoft-just-tease-a-halo-ce-remaster">Spencer casually revealed</a> that “the next <em>Forza</em>” is coming next year, along with “the return of a classic that’s been with us since the beginning.” <em>Halo CE</em> was the launch title for the original Xbox, which turns 25 years old in 2026.</span></li><li><span><strong>Gears of War: E-Day is coming in 2026</strong>. Microsoft also confirmed this week that <em>E-Day</em> won’t be launching in 2025 and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/682283/gears-of-war-e-day-release-date-2026">will debut in 2026 instead</a>. The latest entry in the sci-fi shooter series will be released in the year that marks the 20th anniversary of the original <em>Gears of War</em> game debuting on the Xbox 360. It also means that Xbox’s 25-year milestone will include new <em>Halo</em>, <em>Forza</em>, <em>Fable</em>, and <em>Gears </em>games.</span></li><li><span><strong>Microsoft Edge’s picture-in-picture mode is getting better controls. </strong>The picture-in-picture window in Edge is <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/681499/microsoft-edges-picture-in-picture-mode-is-getting-better-controls">getting the ability</a> to easily pause, play, and skip forward or backward. The UI looks a lot like the Windows Media Player, and it’s part of a new media control center for the Edge browser.</span></li><li><span><strong>Microsoft is just leaving some Liquid Glass here. </strong>Who did the glass-like design first? Was it Apple with its Aqua transparency effects in 2000 or Microsoft with its Aero Glass theme in Windows Vista in 2007? Either way, Microsoft has <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@windows/video/7514445758280551722?embed_source=121374463%2C121468991%2C121439635%2C121433650%2C121404358%2C121497414%2C121477481%2C121351166%2C121487028%2C73347566%2C121331973%2C120811592%2C120810756%2C121503376%3Bnull%3Bembed_blank&amp;refer=embed&amp;referer_url=www.theverge.com%2Fnews%2F685325%2Fmicrosoft-is-just-leaving-some-liquid-glass-here&amp;referer_video_id=7514445758280551722">released a TikTok video</a> that makes it clear what the company thinks of Apple’s new Liquid Glass design. </span></li><li><span><strong>Microsoft CEO says OpenAI alliance is changing but remains strong</strong>. In an interview with Bloomberg TV’s <strong>Emily Chang</strong>, Microsoft CEO <strong>Satya Nadella</strong> has admitted that the company’s <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-06-05/microsoft-ceo-says-openai-alliance-changing-but-remains-strong">OpenAI relationship is changing</a>. “Any company that has gone from being a research lab to one of the most successful product companies of this age — obviously things have to change for them and for us and in the context of the partnership,” Nadella says. Microsoft is increasingly focused on diversifying its AI model usage, instead of relying solely on OpenAI’s latest advancements.</span></li><li><span><strong>Microsoft’s new Copilot Vision can “see” your apps on Windows. </strong>Microsoft is launching <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/685963/microsoft-copilot-vision-windows-launch">Copilot Vision for Windows today</a>, an extension of its AI assistant that lets you share your screen or apps so that Copilot can do things like coach you through using Adobe Photoshop features or analyze the photos and webpages you’re looking at. I first tried this during the 50th anniversary event in April, and I was surprised to see it could guide me through playing Minecraft or using some Windows apps. It’s launching for Windows users in the US today.</span></li></ul></div><p>I’m always keen to hear from readers, so please drop a comment here, or you can reach me at <a href="mailto:notepad@theverge.com">notepad@theverge.com</a> if you want to discuss anything else.

<section><p>The Lumines series is getting a major glow-up--literally and metaphorically.</p></section>
        
        
                    
              <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p>After playing 20 minutes of Lumines Arise, the team from Enhance presented me with a difficult decision. "We have another 20 or so minutes left. Do you want to spend the rest of your time asking us some questions, or would you like to play a bit more?" And as much as I wanted to jump straight into interviews and pick the minds of the folks who brought us Humanity, Tetris Effect, and Rez Infinite, I found myself betrayed by my own childlike glee.</p><p dir="ltr">"Would you mind if I do just a couple more levels?" I asked.</p><p dir="ltr">It was in that moment--when the part of me that simply loves games overtook the part of me that tries her hardest to maintain a writer's sensibilities--that I realized I <em>really</em> enjoyed my time with Lumines Arise. And though of course I took time to chat with game and art director Takashi Ishihara and creative producer Mark MacDonald and enjoyed every minute of it, I left the preview event wishing that somehow the next entry in the Lumines series was back at my hotel, loaded up on my Steam Deck, and waiting for me to get back to playing it.</p><p dir="ltr">This isn't to say I didn't get enough time to get a sense of how Lumines Arise is shaping up. During the preview event, I played through a pre-made playlist of four songs followed by <em>another</em> playlist with two additional songs after I proved overly voracious. With each track lasting around four minutes, this made for around 30 minutes of Lumines Arise goodness. From what I gathered, it seems as though the mode I played essentially allows players to construct their own setlists by selecting songs from the game's main story, referred to as Journey mode. As such, I encountered the songs out of order and without the context that I assume would be provided in story mode. And yet, that didn't stop them from being visually delightful, memorable, and, most importantly, a lot of fun.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4512721-lumines-arise-01.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4512721" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4512721-lumines-arise-01.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4512721"></a><figcaption>A golden-hued level that sees players arrange dark blue orbs and yellow squares.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4512721-lumines-arise-01.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">For those unfamiliar with Lumines, the overall gameplay feels very similar to Tetris: Blocks fall down, you rotate and place them to help clear the board, and "topping out" spells game over. However, whereas Tetris sees you place tetrominos of various shapes down to help form lines that then clear your board, Lumines focuses entirely on squares. Each construct you are given is 2x2 consisting of up to two different types of blocks; as you place them down, your goal is to form squares (2x2 or greater) consisting of the same block type.</p><p dir="ltr">Once a square is formed, you have until the vertical "Time Line" sweeps across the board to add to it, making the seconds between a square's construction and that sweep a rush to extend your block to a 3x3, 4x4, and so on. Though it doesn't directly correlate to the track's RPM, the Time Line helps emphasize the musicality of the game and builds up your internal rhythm. Arise also gets a new twist with its Burst meter, which slowly fills up over time and can then be used to lock a square to your grid for a few passes of the Time Line, allowing you to add to it for longer and subsequently clear more of the board.</p><p dir="ltr">Though this is all relatively simple to grasp, it's certainly harder in execution. And interestingly, the more I <em>thought </em>about what I was doing in Lumines Arise, the trickier things seemed to become. Fortunately, everything about Arise--from its music and visuals to its gameplay--encourages you to enter the same trance-like flow state it inhabits. Everything is fluid, stylish, and hypnotizing. And yet, there is an undeniable tension that comes hand-in-hand with these sorts of puzzle games--the ones that can grow overwhelming, constricting, and unwieldy with just a few poorly placed tiles. Ultimately, though, all this makes for wonderful juxtaposition that is not just a core part of Lumines Arise mechanically, but narratively as well.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4512712-lumines-arise-05.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4512712" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4512712-lumines-arise-05.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4512712"></a><figcaption>A darker level that is largely silent and features empty boxes and clunky, metal box fans.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4512712-lumines-arise-05.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">While I didn't play Arise's Journey mode, one of the handful of levels I did play was notably darker in tone than the others, offering a look at places the game's narrative might go. In place of pulsing lights and electronic pop was oppressive silence and mechanical groans; rather than placing down flashing circles and boxes, I was given harsh, metal box fans and hollow white boxes to try to form into squares. Within a minute, I felt incredibly tense, and told the team as much with a nervous laugh.</p><p dir="ltr">According to creative producer Mark MacDonald, this was entirely the point, as Arise's story focuses on "life's highs and lows, and how we balance the good with the bad." Naturally, actually tackling this theme and conveying these messages is a bit difficult due to the game's lack of a written narrative. Though having songs with lyrics in the game can act as a sort of "cheat," MacDonald laughed, as it gives players a more clear sense of how they are meant to feel, lyrics can often be a bit abstract or metaphorical. Atmosphere, then, is largely how the team makes this happen, and just as Lumines influenced how Enhance constructed Tetris Effect's environments and storytelling, the team said they looked to Tetris Effect to shape Arise.</p><p dir="ltr">"A challenge of our games is that we are telling stories in abstract ways and in ways only we have really done," MacDonald said. "Lumines informed Tetris Effect, and now we're seeing things circle as Tetris Effect shapes Lumines Arise."</p><p dir="ltr">Shortly after this interaction, the eerie, monochromatic level started to unweave itself and came to an end. I was then greeted by two dancing chameleons, having the time of their lives, while a fast-paced song thumped away in the background. These levels are indeed an abstract and interesting take on life's "highs and lows," but they absolutely rule, too.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4512711-lumines-arise-06.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4512711" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4512711-lumines-arise-06.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4512711"></a><figcaption>A funky level that features two chameleons and circles and squares to arrange.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4512711-lumines-arise-06.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">As I bobbed my head along to the music and got back into the swing of things, game and art director Takashi Ishihara was delighted that the atmosphere he and the team had constructed was doing precisely what was intended.</p><p dir="ltr">"Some people cried when they finished Tetris Effect, and we were blown away by that response," Ishihara said. "I think people who have a deep connection to art and music--who are connected to their emotions and sensitive to atmosphere--will really respond to [Lumines Arise]."</p><p>That said, I suspect that even those coming to Lumines Arise purely for a delightful new puzzle game will still be plenty impressed. It's fun, engaging, <em>slightly</em> tense, visually spectacular, and has the same delightful fluidity that Enhance is known for delivering. All in all, I can't wait to spend more time with it once it hits PS5 and PC later this year.</p>

                <p>It's been almost a decade since the original Postal was given a modern remake in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/postal-redux-pc-release-date-announced-ps4-edition/1100-6439661/" data-ref-id="1100-6439661">Postal Redux</a>. Now, it's time for 2003's Postal 2 to get the same treatment with Postal 2 Redux, "a ground‐up overhaul" of the original game.</p><p>Postal 2 Redux is in development with Flat2VR Studios, Team Beef, and Running With Scissors, with a Kickstarter campaign slated to begin later this summer. According to the announcement, the revitalized game grew out of an initial attempt to bring Postal 2 to VR. Now, the original assets will be recreated in Unity with "enhanced visuals, new weapons, nastier physics, and enough Easter eggs to back‐up the porcelain at Uncle Dave’s Compound."</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EzNUeNiAplI" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/EzNUeNiAplI" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>While the announcement teaser doesn't have much to show off, some of the features planned for Portal 2 Redux include the ability to pet Champ the dog, as well as the addition of dynamic lighting, more refined crowds, fully breakable interiors, and an open world that can be explored without any loading screens.</p><p>According to the developers, the plan is to bring Postal 2 Redux to PC, macOS, Linux rigs, PlayStation 4 and 5, Xbox Series X|S, and possibly Switch 1 or 2. However, the team notes that the final platform lineup has yet to be finalized and it may depend on stretch goals achieved through Kickstarter as well as approval from the console-makers in question.</p><p>The Kickstarter pre-launch page for Postal 2 Redux is <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/postal2redux/postal-2-redux" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">currently online</a>, but the campaign doesn't have an official start date yet. There's no word about whether <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/postal-iii-review/1900-6348436/" data-ref-id="1900-6348436">Postal 3</a> may get remake as well. That game was so poorly received among Postal fans in 2011 that Running With Scissors later retconned <a href="https://postal.fandom.com/wiki/Postal_III" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Postal 3 as a non-canonical game</a>. The most recent title in the franchise was Postal 4: No Regerts, which <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/postal-4-no-regerts-review-nothing-but-regrets/1900-6417864/" data-ref-id="1900-6417864">debuted to bad reviews</a> in 2022.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/four-great-games-from-steam%E2%80%99s-june-next-fest.1216887/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/games/685748/steam-next-fest-june-2025-demos<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Steam’s June 2025 edition of its Next Fest is going on now through June 16th, and the event is packed with great-looking demos for games coming to PC. Seriously, it seems like there are a <em>lot</em> of demos; a search filter on my Next Fest homepage shows more than 2,500 English demos to pick from.</p><p>If you open up the <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fsale%2Fnextfest" rel="sponsored">Next Fest page</a> and are overwhelmed, I get it – admittedly, I am, too. But I’ve played a few and have four to recommend.</p><div><p id="mina-the-hollower"><h3>Mina the Hollower</h3></p></div><p><em><a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fapp%2F3741460%2FMina_the_Hollower_Demo%2F" rel="sponsored">Mina the Hollower</a></em>, the next game from <em>Shovel Knight</em> creators Yacht Club Games, feels like a Game Boy Color title made in the modern era. You play as Mina the mouse in a top-down action-adventure game that reminds me a lot of <em>Link’s Awakening</em>. <em>Mina’s</em> signature move is a slick burrowing ability that lets you zip around underground for a few seconds, and even in the short demo, I found it immensely useful to get under obstacles or create space during hairy fights. </p><p>The demo ends with an exciting boss fight, and I was sad when it was over after about 30 minutes. I’m really looking forward to the game’s full release on October 31st. </p><div><p id="ninja-gaiden-ragebound"><h3>Ninja Gaiden: Ragebound</h3></p></div><p><em><a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fapp%2F2542120%2FNINJA_GAIDEN_Ragebound%2F" rel="sponsored">Ninja Gaiden: Ragebound</a></em> is a retro-style side-scrolling action-platformer with gorgeous pixel art and an electric guitar-filled soundtrack. Like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/684438/ninja-gaiden-4-hands-on-xbox-showcase-2025">other <em>Ninja Gaiden</em> games</a>, it’s filled with flashy combat and a lot of blood, but I also quite liked the old-school platforming – there’s a lot of double-jumping off enemies, which never gets old. Like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/677300/dotemu-ceo-games-retro-ninja-gaiden-marvel-absolum">other Dotemu games</a>, <em>Ragebound</em> seems to perfectly capture an old-school vibe but with a game made in 2025. And after finishing the three levels in the demo, I’m eager to play the rest of the game when it’s out on July 31st.</p><div><p id="ball-x-pit"><h3>Ball X Pit</h3></p></div><p>Within moments of starting <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fapp%2F3651790%2FBALL_x_PIT_Demo%2F" rel="sponsored">the <em>Ball X Pit</em> demo</a>, I openly said to myself, “oh no.” Not because it’s bad. But because it immediately grabbed me as an engrossing blend of roguelikes, <em>Puzzle Bobble</em>, <em>Breakout</em>, and <em>Vampire Survivors</em>.</p><p>As enemies slowly advance toward you, you move your character around and fire balls at them, which you can bounce off walls or even between enemies. (Naturally, you’ll have to dodge bullets from the bad guys, too.) Dead enemies drop experience gems, and when you level up, you can pick from various upgrades, like balls that shock nearby foes. You can even fuse balls together, and between runs there’s a land management game. And for the people that this will matter to, your health meter looks like it was taken right from <em>Diablo</em>.</p><p>I can see losing a lot of time to <em>Ball X Pit</em> when it’s out later this year.</p><div><p id="word-play"><h3>Word Play</h3></p></div><div><p><cite>Image: Game Maker’s Toolkit</cite></p></div><p><em><a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fapp%2F3586660%2FWord_Play%2F" rel="sponsored">Word Play</a></em>, from Mark Brown of Game Maker’s Toolkit, mixes ideas from <em>Balatro</em> and word games.</p><p>Each round, you’re tasked with getting a specific score by spelling words that can be up to ten characters long before you run out of turns. As with games like <em>Scrabble</em>, different letter tiles have different point values, and words with five letters or more will get added bonus points that will help you reach the goal score more quickly.</p><p>When you reach the goal score, you move on to the next round, which will have a higher goal. But you’ll also be able to pick from an upgrade of some kind, like a modifier that automatically applies a 3x multiplier to the second tile of any word you spell.</p><p>Unlike the rest of the demos I’ve recommended here, <em>Word Play</em> is a chill puzzle game, but like with <em>Balatro</em>, I found myself trying to sneak in one more run instead of going to bed. The game is set to launch on July 14th.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/metal-gear-online">Metal Gear Online</a>! I'm assuming that's the first thing you thought of when you heard that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater">Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</a> is getting an online mode, but I need you to throw that thought in the bin. The MGS3 remake is getting a multiplayer mode, but as shown off in today's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/konami">Konami</a> Press Start <a href="https://youtu.be/NXaDgU72gRI?si=EFZz0vU8kfrLvcOb">showcase</a>, it'll be its own, original thing called Fox Hunt.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
"Fox Hunt is a completely original online battle mode," said mode director Yu Sahara of the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-stealth-games">stealth game</a> during the showcase. "Although it shares the same worldview of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/metal-gear-solid">Metal Gear Solid</a> Delta, the gameplay is completely different. Perhaps many people will think of Metal Gear Online when hearing about a Metal Gear Online battle mode, but Fox Hunt is different from Metal Gear Online."

<p>
Because specifics weren't shared, I can't tell you how exactly it differs from the original multiplayer <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/metal-gear">Metal Gear</a>. One thing that does seem to be a pretty big element of it is an emphasis on camouflage. You can whip out some kind of thing that wraps around your character, and adapts to whatever surface you're sneaking around on.
</p>
<p>
Say there's a brick wall covered in vines - if you go up to it, your camouflage tool will make it look like you're a part of the vines. Or it'll make you look like a clump of rocks alongside a riverbed. It genuinely looks quite effective, and I can imagine it making for some pretty tense matches if you're not looking carefully at your surroundings. More details will be coming at a later date!
</p>
<p>
The showcase also revealed that, ugh, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/silent-hill-1-remake-announced-with-the-briefest-of-teaser-trailers">Silent Hill 1 is getting the remake treatment</a> this time around, with Bloober Team once again at the helm. I'll leave it at that before I go off on a rant about how Silent Hill 1 being so simplistic because it's a PS1 game is part of what makes it so interesting.

Making the occasion extra special is the fact that the cinematic sci-fi war epic is now coming for the first time to PlayStation. It would therefore seem like a no-brainer to make these two beta weekends free for anyone who wants to hop in and discover<em> Gears of Wa</em>r’s unique (<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/three-words-i-said-to-the-man-i-defeated-in-gears-of-wa-5914348&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/three-words-i-said-to-the-man-i-defeated-in-gears-of-wa-5914348">and sometimes toxic</a></span>) flavor of online deathmatch for themselves. Instead, the beta will be exclusive to players who have already ponied up money.</p><p>Here’s what you need to do to qualify for<em> Reloaded</em>’s two-weekend, cross-platform, cross-play multiplayer beta running June 13-15 and June 20-22:</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Pre-order <em>Gears of War: Reloaded</em> digitally for Xbox Series X|S, Xbox on PC, Steam or PlayStation 5   </li><li>Have an active Game Pass Ultimate or PC Game Pass membership  </li><li>Own a digital copy of <em>Gears of War: Ultimate Edition</em></li></ul></blockquote><p>Note that Xbox Series X/S players won’t just need to have an active Game Pass subscription to play, they’ll need to have the more expensive Game Pass Ultimate tier. On PS5, meanwhile, players will have to have pre-ordered the entire $40 remaster. The only ones really lucking out here are those on PC or Xbox who already own the previous <em>Ultimate Edition </em>remaster which nets them an upgrade to Reloaded, and access to the beta, for free. </p><p>It’s a shame the entire beta isn’t free for everyone across all platforms. It would act as an invitation back into the brutal but unique world of classic <em>Gears</em> multiplayer, where the slow movement, snappy dodge rolls, and OP shotguns are unlike anything else in the modern  shooter landscape (<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/GearsOfWar/comments/1ct0ybz/gears_12_and_3_multiplayer_are_getting_more/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GearsOfWar/comments/1ct0ybz/gears_12_and_3_multiplayer_are_getting_more/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">and still has an active community in the original trilogy</a></span>). It would also be a neat moment of multiplatform camaraderie as Microsoft pushes its new <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/xbox-rog-ally-pc-gaming-handheld-price-date-switch-2-1851784000&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-rog-ally-pc-gaming-handheld-price-date-switch-2-1851784000">post-console war, play anywhere, everything is an Xbox-approach to gaming</a></span>. Instead, it’s demanding a cover charge. </p><p>“Our jobs inside the company is to run a good business,” Microsoft Gaming CEO said on the Xbox podcast at Summer Game Fest last week. “We’re accountable to Microsoft for running a good business, a healthy business that continues to grow at both top line and bottom line.” It’s hard not to see a combination of small things like this, and big things like charging $80 for<em> The Outer Worlds 2 </em>(<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.gamesradar.com/games/rpg/as-the-outer-worlds-2-hits-usd80-director-says-we-dont-set-the-prices-for-our-games-and-wishes-everybody-could-play-obsidians-new-rpg/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/rpg/as-the-outer-worlds-2-hits-usd80-director-says-we-dont-set-the-prices-for-our-games-and-wishes-everybody-could-play-obsidians-new-rpg/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">which Obsidian pointed out was Microsoft’s decision</a></span>), as part of a renewed focus on that growth. </p><p>“That’s kind of a foundation for us,” Spencer continued. “And what that does is it allows us to continue to invest in Xbox for our community of players and creators and that we’re doing it. It does mean we have to make trade-offs through the year on things that we’re going to invest more in, things that we’re not going to invest as much in because it is kind of we are the business that we are, but the business is having really good success.” Good enough to eventually decide to make the second beta weekend free? We’ll see. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Onimusha: Way of the Sword - 2nd Trailer: Formidable Foes Emerge</p>
      </div>
<p>Up until now, all mainline Onimusha games have been connected narratively since <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/onimusha-warlords/" data-ref-id="5000-1574">Onimusha: Warlords</a> kicked things off in 2001, often having their protagonists fighting demonic Genma and a possessed Oda Nobunaga's forces. Capcom even went through the effort of remastering the first two games in the series in the 2020s, so it could be believable that it was prepping players to understand the series' overarching narrative and lore prior to its continuation. That's not the case, though, as the only real connection is that players are still fighting Genma and Kadowaki admitted that Way of the Sword's development was separate from <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/onimusha-2-samurais-destiny-gets-a-modern-remaster-this-year/1100-6529245/" data-ref-id="1100-6529245">those remaster efforts</a>.</p><p>Players will control a new protagonist named Miyamoto Mushashi, whose face is modeled after actor Toshiro Mifune and who wields an Oni gauntlet that gives him special powers. That all may sound familiar to those who watched the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/netflixs-onimusha-anime-brings-together-three-japanese-legends/2900-4875/" data-ref-id="2900-4875">Onimusha series on Netflix</a> last year. But once again, Kadowaki denied any sort of connection between the show and new game, even though they both feature the same character modeled after the same real-world actor. "There's absolutely no connection with the Netflix animated series," Kadowaki bluntly confirmed.</p><p>If you are planning on playing Onimusha: Way of the Sword when it launches for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S sometime in 2026, you at least don't have to worry about this franchise's past, as it's a clean slate narratively.</p>

Brandon Adler said in an interview that Obsidian did not set the price for the game, adding that anyone bothered by the price point should take their concerns to Microsoft.</p><p>"We're a game developer. We love to make games.

"Like, personally, as a game developer, I wish everybody could play my game, because that's what I want out of this whole thing. But for the reasons and so like, why the $79.99 price point, you'd have to honestly talk to the Xbox folks."</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> The Outer Worlds 2 - Official Story Trailer | Xbox Games Showcase 2025</p>
      </div>
<p>The Outer Worlds 2 is Microsoft's first $80 game, but it wasn't a total surprise, given that Microsoft had <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-consoles-games-and-accessories-see-price-increases-starting-today/1100-6531257/" data-ref-id="1100-6531257">said it would begin charging $80 for some games in 2025.</a> Microsoft also raised prices on Xbox consoles.</p><p>Outside of Xbox, Nintendo is charging $80 for Mario Kart World, while there are expectations that other publishers will follow suit and start charging more as well. 2K Games has been caught up in pricing drama, too, as Gearbox boss Randy Pitchford has said <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4-boss-reacts-to-price-point-controversy/1100-6531739/" data-ref-id="1100-6531739">he doesn't know if Borderlands 4 will be $80 or not.</a></p><p>What Adler said about The Outer Worlds 2 lines up with what Pitchford has said about Borderlands 4. He mentioned that, as an artist, he wants as many people as possible to play his games. At the same time, he acknowledged that it's a business and the company has to keep making money to make more games. Like Adler, Pitchford also noted that he does not set prices; in his case, 2K Games is making the call.</p><p>As for Xbox, Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer has said again and again that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-boss-says-hes-accountable-to-microsoft-for-running-a-good-business/1100-6532338/" data-ref-id="1100-6532338">it's his job to make money and run a successful business</a>, even if this means the company has to make some tradeoffs.</p><p>"We're accountable to Microsoft for running a good business--a healthy business that continues to grow at both top line and bottom line. That's kind of a foundation for us," Spencer said.</p><p>The Outer Worlds 2 launches on October 29 for Xbox Series X|S, PS5, and PC. If you don't want to pay $80 for it, you can subscribe to Game Pass Ultimate and play it via your membership. Game Pass is not available on PlayStation, however.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://gameinformer.com/impressions/2025/06/12/the-razer-kishi-v3-pro-is-the-best-mobile-gaming-controller-and-its-not-even<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>I’ve always admired the attempts to make mobile gaming feel comparable to my experience gaming on consoles with a controller in hand. I have the Riot PWR controller that mimics the Xbox gamepad, a couple of Backbones, and some other random ones, but none have ever given me the impression I was doing anything more than just making it work. I’m always left wanting something better, something more premium. With Razer’s latest controller, the Kishi V3 Pro, I finally have the controller I’ve always wanted when gaming on my iPhone.</p><p>Let’s get some caveats out of the way before I dive into what I love about the Kishi V3 Pro: It is far and away the most expensive mobile gaming controller out there, closer in price to PlayStation’s DualSense Edge and more costly than PlayStation, Xbox, and Nintendo’s baseline controllers. It’s available worldwide today for a whopping $149.99. It is also only available with a USB-C connection, meaning you’ll need one of Apple’s newer iPhones (if you have an Android phone, you’re likely set) or an iPad Mini to use it. There’s a non-Pro version lacking some of the better features of the Pro for $99.99, and Pro XL version for $199.99, if you want to use a full-sized iPad with it.</p><p>While that price is exorbitant for a mobile controller, once you bite the bullet, you will not regret it.</p>

<p>Immediately upon opening the box, you’re greeted with premium packaging with a blocky foam insert to ensure the controller stays secure. With the controller I received – the Pro – there was another set of analog sticks to connect to the controller: rounded bump sticks and traditional concave sticks. I like the latter on the left side for movement and the former on the right side for faster aiming. Swapping these sticks is as easy as pulling them off with a little bit of force, but it doesn’t feel terrifying to as though you’re breaking the device. You’ll also find a couple of gummy plastic inserts that provide different bumper sizes to the top of your phone, the left side (or top), which isn’t connected to the USB-C connection port. The box is so lovely that I’ve been using it as the controller’s “case” when not in use, and I appreciate Razer’s Apple-like presentation with the packaging. If people are expected to pay $150, every aspect, including the box, needs to feel worth that price tag.</p><p>Prompted to download the Razer Nexus app, I do so and am happyit’s free, because it’s a really nice game launcher that groups together mobile games, ones available in the App Store (which pairs nicely with the free 3 months of Apple Arcade the controller includes), and Xbox PC games available for cloud streaming or remote play. In my briefing with the Razer team before actually receiving a Kishi V3 Pro, it emphasized that Nexus is free and will remain free, making sure to subtly shade “other” mobile controller apps that aren’t free, cough cough, Backbone+, which costs $50 a year after a free year trial.</p><p>Even if Nexus didn’t exist, the Kishi V3 Pro is still an excellent controller. Its design feels most similar to an Xbox controller and has enough girth to feel premium, versus something that feels like it’s doing its best to mimic a standard controller but missing the mark. Razer says the USB-C connection promises little to no latency, though admittedly, I’ve never had latency issues on any of the mobile controllers I’ve used.</p><p>There’s much customization under the hood, too, even beyond the swappable thumbsticks and phone bumpers. The triggers can be switched to an Analog or Digital mode, allowing you to customize their feel, how much you need to press before registering an input, and more. The two back “pedal” buttons are circles that your hands grip around the controller, and they feel similar to clicking a mouse. I haven’t used them too much, but I can imagine the possibilities with shooters, strategy games, and other genres where a mouse click is often more competitive than triggers.</p><p>The Tunnel Magnetoresistance (or TMR) thumbsticks are apparently longer-lasting and more precise than other types, including Hall Effect thumbsticks, according to Razer, and while I’ll need more time to put these to the test, I can say they feel incredible. The same goes for the Hall Effect triggers, 8-way d-pad, and face buttons. There are even two additional buttons up top by the bumpers for more customization. The entire package is lifted by Razer’s Sensa HD Haptics, which do feel quite premium, especially for a mobile controller. Though haptics have never been the gamechanger controller makers boast them to be, I would compare the Sensa HD haptics with Nintendo’s Joy-Con and PlayStation’s DualSense haptics technology.</p>

<p>If you aren’t familiar with the mobile gaming controller market, these are features you won’t find in other controllers. Instead of taking the more casual approach to designing a controller for use with phones, Razer has treated this device like something for the market of gamers the DualSense Edge or Xbox Elite controllers appeals to – it’s for the gamers who want to tinker and toy with small customizable options, the players who don’t want caveats just because they’re using their phone to game. The Riot PWR controller works, the Backbone works, and so do all of my other random devices, but none feel as intentional as the Kishi V3 Pro. It feels like a controller that will become an integral piece of my gaming rotation rather than something I only use on planes or as a quick fix, which is what the Backbone has been for me as of late. Admittedly, this is my first Kishi, so perhaps this line of controllers has always been this way. Still, I imagine this is the company’s best swing yet.</p><p>At the end of the day, though, it’s still a mobile gaming controller. If you play a lot of mobile games, there is no better controller than the Kishi V3 Pro, unless you believe fake gamer and also my boss, Kyle Hilliard. If the feeling of gaming via your mobile device has always hampered your desire to do so, this controller could change that, but if mobile gaming just isn’t for you, this controller likely won’t. Nonetheless, the Kishi V3 Pro blows every other mobile controller I’ve tried out of the water. It is the best controller for my iPhone I’ve ever used, and I look forward to taking more of my games (and this controller) with me on the go.</p><p>The Razer Kishi V3 Pro is available starting today for $149.99.&nbsp;</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://gameinformer.com/2025/06/12/konami-teases-a-remake-of-the-original-silent-hill<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>The big news from Konami’s Press Start presentation today is the tease of a new Silent Hill remake. Bloober Team, the developer behind last year’s <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/review/silent-hill-2/engrossing-and-unsettling">Silent Hill 2 remake</a>, is back at the helm and appears to be tackling the first entry in the series.&nbsp;</p><p>Konami announced the game was in development with nothing more than a simple graphic. Although the publisher doesn’t specify which entry is being remade, all signs point to the first Silent Hill, released for the PlayStation in 1999, given that the game’s main theme song plays during the teaser. You can see the teaser at the tail end of the Press Start presentation at the 35:28 mark.&nbsp;</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NXaDgU72gRI"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NXaDgU72gRI" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>This is likely exciting news for fans; Bloober Team’s remake of Silent Hill 2 was generally well-received, earning an 8.75 out of 10 from <em>Game Informer</em>. It’s unclear when this remake will arrive, given that Bloober Team is currently developing <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/xbox-games-showcase/2025/06/08/bloober-teams-sci-fi-horror-cronos-the-new-dawn-launches-this-fall">Cronos: The New Dawn</a>, slated to launch this fall.&nbsp;</p><p>The first Silent Hill centers on Harry Mason, who searches for his missing adopted daughter in the foggy streets of the eponymous town. The game has no direct narrative connection to its recently remade sequel beyond the setting. If you've never seen Silent Hill in action, you can watch GI editors Kyle Hilliard and Marcus Stewart play the entire game in our six-episode <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/super-replay/2023/01/20/super-replay-silent-hill">Silent Hill Super Replay</a>. Be sure also to check out the latest trailer for <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/state-of-play/2025/06/04/silent-hill-f-gets-release-date-alongside-creepy-new-gameplay">Silent Hill f</a>, the series' next mainline entry, which launches on September 25.&nbsp;</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<figure><a title="Mario Kart World - Switch" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/59bdf11a1b69a/mario-kart-world-switch.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>The latest Japanese boxed charts are here, courtesy of <a href="https://www.famitsu.com/article/202506/44654">Famitsu</a>, and golly gosh, would you believe it, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> has stormed to the top with a total of 782,566 copies sold. That's simply incredible.</p>
<p>The next in line is the Switch 1 version of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/rune_factory_guardians_of_azuma">Rune Factory: Guardians of Azuma</a> with 45,703 copies sold. Truth be told, we're a little surprised that MK World wasn't immediately followed up by another Switch 2 game, but it seems the vast majority of buyers have opted for Nintendo's latest flagship title and left it at that. There's always digital sales to account for too, of course.</p>
<p>That said, both <strong>Zelda</strong> titles on Switch 2 have made the top ten, along with the Switch 2 version of Rune Factory and, of course, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/yakuza-0-directors-cut">Yakuza 0: Director's Cut</a>.</p>

<hr>
<p>With hardware this week, as expected, the Switch 2 is off to a roaring start in Japan, but we weren't prepared for just <em>how</em> successful it would be. The console has sold a whopping 947,931 consoles at launch.</p>
<p>This means that the Switch 2 is comfortably the fastest-selling console in Japan of all time, smashing the previous record of 630,552 set by the almighty PlayStation 2. Similarly, the GBA managed to sell 611,000, the DS 468,000, and the original Switch 330,637.</p>
<p>To put this into further perspective, the Switch 2 has already outsold the Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S, Xbox Series X Digital Edition, <em>and</em> the PlayStation 5 Pro combined. It's also almost outsold the PlayStation 5 Digital Edition too, though it's still a little way off surpassing the standard disc version.</p>
<p>We imagine these numbers will only continue to skyrocket in the coming weeks, so long as Nintendo maintains decent stock, and frankly we can't wait to see where the Switch 2 ends up by the end of the year.</p>
<p>Here's your look at the latest Japanese hardware sales in full:</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/new-silent-hill-f-deep-dive-digs-into-how-konamis-core-design-concept-of-find-the-beauty-in-terror-drove-the-games-development/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Just last week, Konami announced that <a href="https://wccftech.com/silent-hill-f-launches-on-ps5-xbox-series-x-s-and-pc-in-september-2025-new-gameplay-showcased/">Silent Hill f</a> would arrive on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC, on September 25, 2025, and today, during the company's Press Start presentation, we got our latest developed deep-dive from Konami, and a Japanese studio it collaborated with on Silent Hill f, Neobards.</p>
<p>Members from both Konami and Neobards talked about how the teams worked together to evolve the design of Silent Hill f to both keep the essence of a Silent Hill game, while leaning into the fact that the game is not set in the western town of Silent Hill, but in Japan, and is going for a Japanese style of horror story than anything else in the series so far.</p>
<p>"<em>The setting of Silent Hill f has shifted from the town of Silent Hill to Japan,</em>" said Silent Hill series producer at Konami, Motoi Okamoto. "<em>But it remains a psychological horror experience where one confronts themselves within a mental world. Taking into account that it is a psychological horror, we sought to enhance the essence of Japanese-style horror. The hallmark of Japanese horror is not simply grotesqueness, but the coexistence of beauty and the disturbing. We are creating this title with the concept: Find the beauty in terror</em>."</p>
<p><iframe title="KONAMI PRESS START 6.12.2025 ( KONAMI Game News )" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NXaDgU72gRI?start=303&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Neobards game director, Al Yang, added, "<em>We created our visual designs to have a distinct uneasiness to them, but also have a horrific charm that would make it so you just couldn't stop staring. In this matter, we were extremely fortunate to be able to work with Kera-san to design our key character art, as their designs perfectly suited the ideal of 'Beauty in Terror'.</em>"</p>

<p>We also heard from the game's scriptwriter, Ryukishi07, who discussed how he connected elements of present-day Japan with how different Japan was in the 1960s, which isn't exactly that long ago but is still very different compared to modern-day Japan.</p>
<p>With Silent Hill f's launch still months away, we'll likely hear and see more about the game before its release, but even now it feels safe to say that this is shaping up to potentially be one of the most terrifying Silent Hill games yet.</p>
<p>Silent Hill f also wasn't the only Silent Hill game featured during Konami's presentation, as the company also announced that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDORsTHAQSs">Bloober Team</a> would be back to <a href="https://wccftech.com/silent-hill-remake-bloober/">remake the first Silent Hill game</a>.</p>

            <link>https://www.theverge.com/news/686013/razer-kishi-v3-xl-ipad-pro-air-android-hands-on-gaming</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/razer%E2%80%99s-new-mobile-controller-can-stretch-wide-enough-to-fit-an-ipad-pro.1216827/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/news/686013/razer-kishi-v3-xl-ipad-pro-air-android-hands-on-gaming<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>The iPad Mini is no longer the biggest tablet you can fit into a mobile gaming controller (<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/17/24344308/asus-rog-flow-acer-nitro-blaze-steam-deck-giant-pc-handheld-experiment">without breaking it a little</a>). Razer’s new $199.99 Kishi V3 Pro XL can accommodate a 13-inch iPad or Android tablet that uses a USB-C connector. It’s like Razer’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/3/28/4155606/razer-edge-review">2013 Edge</a>, in spirit at least.</p><p>My 10.9-inch iPad Air is a cinch to fit inside of the Kishi V3 Pro XL, and having even this large of a screen to play on is a treat. How could it not be? Not only that, its speakers sound fantastic for playing games.</p><p>The ability to fit a huge tablet is the key feature of the Kishi V3 Pro XL specifically, but it shares other gen-to-gen improvements with the smaller, cheaper Kishi V3 options in the lineup: the $99.99 V3 and $149.99 V3 Pro. Razer says that the Kishi V3’s design was inspired by its own Wolverine V3 Pro Xbox controller (<a href="https://www.theverge.com/23025443/best-xbox-controllers-one-series-x-s">our pick for the best alternative to the Xbox Elite Series 2</a>), which was clear to me as I got some gaming time in with the XL.</p><p>All the controllers in the Kishi V3 lineup include full-size <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/643886/joystick-drift-tunneling-magnetoresistance-tmr-hall-effect-gaming-solution">TMR joysticks</a> (with swappable caps), which use magnets instead of physical contacts for registering inputs, and thus aren’t prone to stick drift. The controller grips are more pronounced and are covered in an etched texture to keep them snug in your hands. The pair of configurable macro buttons near the triggers from prior Kishi models are present in the Kishi V3 Pro XL, along with a new second pair around the rear of the grips. The V3 Pro and V3 Pro XL support haptics, but only on Android, or when connected to a computer via USB-C cable (not included).</p><p>I had a great time testing <a href="https://www.theverge.com/pc-gaming/676167/nvidia-geforce-now-steam-deck-test-hands-on">GeForce Now on the Steam Deck</a>, so I wanted to take advantage of the Kishi V3 Pro XL to try it on an iPad’s larger screen. Not that it’s Razer’s fault, but it’s more difficult to get GeForce Now running on an iPad, since Apple’s App Store policies require streaming experiences to run through a browser, not through their own dedicated apps.</p><div><p><cite>Image: Cameron Faulkner/The Verge</cite></p></div><p>Once I got it running, the game window fit the iPad’s aspect ratio almost perfectly, save for small black bars on the left and right sides of the screen in landscape mode. This won’t be an issue if your tablet has a 16:9 aspect ratio. Despite my fast internet speeds, visual quality looked worse on the iPad Air than it does on the Steam Deck OLED. That could be because the iPad has a much larger screen and a significantly higher resolution that make it a lot easier to see visual artifacts in a cloud streaming session. Still, latency felt good enough that I could complete parries in <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games-review/656405/clair-obscur-expedition-33-review-xbox-ps5-pc"><em>Expedition 33: Clair Obscur</em></a>.</p><p>The moment the Kishi V3 Pro XL clicked with me was when I launched Razer’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/646810/razer-pc-remote-play-ios-android-game-streaming">somewhat-new PC Remote Play experience</a>. It performs really well, if you’re okay with installing Razer apps on your PC. You’ll need Razer Cortex, which lets you run games on your PC and stream them to your handheld. Cortex makes the feed look fantastic, taking full advantage of the iPad’s screen resolution. Steam’s Link app works just fine, too, and it’s a convenient option if you’re accustomed to using a Steam Deck since it has a similar interface.</p><p>With my iPad Air installed, the Kishi V3 Pro XL setup weighs about 1.7 pounds, which is over a fourth of a pound heavier than the Steam Deck OLED, and just a touch heavier than the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/684247/xbox-ally-x-hands-on-gears-of-war-reloaded">new Xbox ROG Ally handheld</a>. It’s a little too cumbersome to hold comfortably with one hand, even if just for a moment to itch my shoulder. I assumed this would be the case, though it’s worth keeping in mind if you have an even bigger tablet than me. Still, it’s a comfortable two-handed experience if you’re hunkered down on the couch.</p><p>The Kishi V3Pro XL has less direct competition than the rest of the Kishi V3 lineup. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/661382/the-new-backbone-pro-could-be-the-one-controller-for-all-your-gaming">Backbone’s </a>$169.99 <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/661382/the-new-backbone-pro-could-be-the-one-controller-for-all-your-gaming">Pro</a> controller doesn’t attempt to fit devices larger than a phone. But unlike the Kishi V3 series, it can be used as a standalone Bluetooth controller for your other devices — including tablets — when a phone isn’t wedged into it. The <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/24/24187539/gamesir-g8-bluetooth-mobile-controller-ios-android-nintendo-switch-pc">GameSir G8 Plus</a> is a cheaper option at $79.99, and can stretch to fit an iPad Mini or the original Nintendo Switch, but it can’t fit a full-sized iPad like the Kishi V3 Pro XL can. </p><p>While I’m not thrilled with the $199.99 price, there’s an audience that’s been asking for something like the Kishi V3 Pro XL to exist and will probably pay for it. It’s a great way to use your tablet as a console-like gaming device, putting its screen and speakers front and center. As for me, I’m thrilled to have more fun things to do with my iPad Air instead of using it exclusively as a Ms. Rachel device for our one year old (no shade to Ms. Rachel).</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/deltarune-has-a-hidden-message-on-playstation-for-anyone-who-manages-to-earn-no-trophies-at-all.1216821/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/deltarune-has-a-hidden-message-on-playstation-for-anyone-who-manages-to-earn-no-trophies-at-all<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">With Deltarune chapters 3 and 4 out last week, players have been eagerly mining the new episodes for more of Toby Fox's characteristic secrets and mysterious plot threads. In the process, they've found an absolutely fascinating bit of dialogue that's almost impossible to get, as it requires beating all four chapters of Deltarune on PlayStation without earning a single trophy.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Warning: While this article won't spoil any of the major plot moments of Deltarune, it will talk in vague terms about some of the more common and low/no-spoiler trophy achievements. If you're someone who doesn't want to know a single piece of information about Deltarune before going in, probably better skip this one!</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">As shared by Reddit user millsbuddy, there's a special, hidden bit of dialogue that appears in Deltarune Chapter 4's credits sequence if, and only if, the player has completed all four chapters without earning a single trophy. This allegedly checks the player's PSN account, so if you try to get this text, fail by accidentally getting a trophy, delete your file and try again, no luck. You still have the trophy, so it won't appear.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This is an even more ridiculous task than it sounds on its face, as some of the achievements are so laughably easy to get that you're almost certainly going to get at least a few by accident just through playing normally. There are achievements for taking damage a certain number of times, for using or equiping items, for getting a Game Over, equipping armor, opening too many treasure chests, interacting with chairs, and a lot more. Some achievements have multiple possible triggers. There are also four achievements simply obtained by completing a chapter, but you can avoid getting those by finding a certain secret item in each chapter that will nullify the achievement.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Trophies were added to Deltarune with the addition of Chapters 3 and 4 last week, but they're PlayStation-exclusive. Fox <a href="https://toby.fangamer.com/newsletters/release-date/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">noted in a newsletter</a> that this was because trophies were a requirement to shipping a paid game on PlayStation, and alluded to the challenge of finding this special text in his announcement:</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We were required to have TROPHIES! This time, they give rise to a pretty hard-core challenge. But - and PLEASE listen - I make no endorsement that you actually attempt it! Even knowing of its mere existence will only bring you frustration and anguish! Honestly, it may be one of the worst ideas I've ever had. Perhaps no one will even try. Maybe that's for the best after all... I think it will be too late for most of you anyway..."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For the vast majority of us who either aren't playing on PlayStation or like retaining our sanity, here's the text that appears when you accompish this. <strong>WARNING: If you consider this text a spoiler, don't keep reading below the trailer!</strong></p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><blockquote>INTERESTING.</blockquote><blockquote>YOU FAILED</blockquote><blockquote>TO ACHIEVE</blockquote><blockquote>ANY MARKS.</blockquote><blockquote>WHAT</blockquote><blockquote>ARE</blockquote><blockquote>YOU?</blockquote><blockquote>"(playername)"</blockquote><blockquote>I VERY MUCH</blockquote><blockquote>LOOK FORWARD</blockquote><blockquote>TO THE NEXT.</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">This text seems to be spoken by the same voice that addresses the player in the opening of the game and in a few other places, as well as the same voice that speaks in the end credits with a different message if you finish under any other conditions. Fans, of course, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/W._D._Gaster" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">have plenty of theories on who this is</a>, but we'll leave that to the community for now.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">With chapters 3 and 4 finally out, we've reviewed Deltarune so far, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/deltarune-review">giving it a 9/10</a> and saying that its "incredible story is already bursting with hilarious charm, unforgettable characters, and an iconic soundtrack that make it worth investing your time in," even though its story is only halfway done.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

The developer has now issued a statement, saying it is "heartbroken" over the game's difficulties.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Build A Rocket Boy’s debut title came out on June 10 across PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X and S, and PC via Steam. On Valve’s platform, it currently has a ‘mixed’ user review rating, with most of the complaints revolving around performance issues, bugs and glitches, broken AI, and game crashes.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Some players have reported gaining refunds — even from the notoriously stubborn Sony — rekindling memories of Cyberpunk 2077’s disastrous launch back in 2020. CD Projekt's game was eventually pulled from sale on the PlayStation Store, but there is no indication yet that MindsEye will suffer a similar fate.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">PlayStation is allowing refunds for MindsEye <a href="https://t.co/zzaHbNt3ET" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://t.co/zzaHbNt3ET</a> <a href="https://t.co/KclpMTwSJi" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/KclpMTwSJi</a></p>— Wario64 (@Wario64) <a href="https://twitter.com/Wario64/status/1933152235417939985?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">June 12, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Meanwhile, streamers are saying they received requests to postpone their sponsored MindsEye livestreams, some last minute. As spotted by Kotaku's Ethan Gach, popular streamer CohhCarnage revealed this happened to him just as he was about to begin a sponsored MindsEye livestream:</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><div data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>MindsEye dev canceled Twitch streamer CohhCarnage's playthrough of the game seconds before it was supposed to start.</p><p>He said it was the first time that had ever happened in his streaming career. <a href="https://t.co/KOjyQ8ml21" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/KOjyQ8ml21</a></p></div>— AmericanTruckSongs9 (@ethangach) <a href="https://twitter.com/ethangach/status/1932892473249992746?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">June 11, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">“For the first time in my streaming career, I changed my title for a sponsored stream, I put in a profile button, I put in the command, that was at eight o'clock sharp — my sponsored stream was supposed to start at eight — I opened up MindsEye, and as it was loading, my management contacted me and said, ‘The sponsor does not want to do this right now, they would like to reschedule.’ And I said, ‘Oh, that’s a first.’ So the sponsor decided not to do the sponsorship for now, and honestly, it sounds like for MindsEye that was the right decision.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Another streamer, DarkViperAU, couldn't even make it through their sponsored MindsEye livestream without breaking down in tears of laughter.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">Sponsored MindsEye streamer can't keep it together when telling viewers where they can buy the game. <a href="https://t.co/kdR3EuGims" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/kdR3EuGims</a></p>— AmericanTruckSongs9 (@ethangach) <a href="https://twitter.com/ethangach/status/1932816433425395799?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">June 11, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">In response to the chaos of the past 24 hours, Build A Rocket Boy issued a statement on its Discord, addressing MindsEye’s community and the game's various issues.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We are heartbroken that not every player was able to experience the game as we intended,” the statement began. “Our priority is optimizing performance and stability so that every player, across every device, can enjoy an equally high-quality experience.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Our teams have worked tirelessly throughout the night to solve many of these issues, and we have now identified that the vast majority of crashes were caused by a memory leak. This impacted roughly 1 in 10 of our players. We have developed a hotfix that addresses this issue (alongside other issues that our players have highlighted), which we are working hard to deploy as soon as tomorrow on PC and on consoles once it passes certification with PlayStation and Xbox.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We are fully committed to ensuring all our players have a great experience, and we will continue to provide frequent and transparent updates. We will do our best to respond to all your comments and feedback.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Thank you for playing MindsEye. Thank you for your understanding and continued support – it truly means the world to us. We’re grateful and blessed to have you on the journey with us.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Build A Rocket Boy then outlined the hotfix schedule for the coming weeks. By the end of June, it said, players can expect ongoing performance and stability improvements, a rebalanced ‘hard’ difficulty setting, animation fixes, and AI improvements.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It remains to be seen whether Build A Rocket Boy can turn MindsEye around following this troubled start. While Steam concurrent player numbers do not paint the whole picture of a game's success, particularly single-player games, they do provide us with an idea of a game's popularity on Steam's platform. On Steam, MindsEye has a peak concurrent player count of 3,302.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN. Find him on Twitter at @wyp100.

No release date was mentioned. For more, check out <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/konami-press-start-live-june-2025-everything-announced">everything announced at Konami Press Start Live June 2025</a>.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In February, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/silent-hill-2-remake-developer-bloober-signs-deal-for-another-game-for-konami-could-it-be-more-silent-hill">Bloober Team announced it had signed a deal with Konami</a> to make a new game based on the Japanese company’s IP, following the successful release of the Silent Hill 2 remake. Now we know it was for a remake of the first Silent Hill game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Silent Hill exploded onto the scene in 1999 on the PlayStation as a Resident Evil rival from Konami. It established the series’ trademark fog-filled visuals, third-person viewpoint, and the eerie town of Silent Hill itself. It sees Harry Mason searching for his missing adopted daughter, Cheryl — and all manner of horrible things along the way.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Silent Hill 2 remake has sold 2 million copies, so it’s no surprise to see Konami greenlight another remake in the series. And it is no surprise to see the first game get the remake treatment next. In an IGN poll, over 61% of the 20,000 voters picked Silent Hill as the Silent Hill game Konami should remake next.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Here’s the official blurb from Bloober CEO Piotr Babieno, issued back in February:</p><blockquote>Konami, a legendary name in the gaming industry, sought a partner who could breathe new life into one of its most iconic franchises — Silent Hill. Bloober Team was selected for their expertise in horror and atmospheric storytelling, and in 2021, both companies signed a partnership agreement. In October 2022, during the official Silent Hill Transmission livestream, it was announced that Bloober Team was working on a remake of Silent Hill 2, widely regarded as one of the best psychological horror games in history.</blockquote><blockquote>The success of the remake proved that Bloober Team had perfectly captured the atmosphere and depth of the original while introducing crucial innovations. The game was well-received by players, earning an 86/100 rating on Metacritic and an 88/100 on OpenCritic, along with numerous awards, including Game of the Year 2024 from IGN Japan and Best Horror Game of the Year from the IGN Community Awards.</blockquote><blockquote>The trust built upon the success of Silent Hill 2 laid the foundation for signing another agreement for a new project. The deal aligns with Bloober Team’s strategic plan to expand its internal development division within a first-party framework.</blockquote><blockquote>Our collaboration with Konami has been incredibly fruitful, and the success of Silent Hill 2 speaks for itself. By sharing knowledge and experience, we have been able to create high-quality production together. Of course, we can't reveal too many details at this time, but we are confident that fans will be just as excited about our collaboration as we are. We can't wait to share something truly special with players when the time is right.</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">Silent Hill 2 remake went on sale on PlayStation 5 and PC via Steam on October 8, 2024 (<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/silent-hill-2-remake-console-exclusive-to-ps5-for-1-year"><u>there’s no word on an Xbox Series X and S version</u></a> yet), and just a few days later <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/silent-hill-2-remake-sells-1-million-copies-in-less-than-a-week"><u>had sold 1 million copies</u></a>. This was thought to have made Silent Hill 2 remake the fastest-selling Silent Hill game ever, but Konami has yet to rubber stamp that potential record.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">IGN’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/silent-hill-2-2024-review"><u>Silent Hill 2 remake review</u></a> returned an 8/10. We said: “Silent Hill 2 is a great way to visit – or revisit – one of the most dread-inducing destinations in the history of survival horror.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The sales success of the Silent Hill 2 remake has clearly strengthened Konami’s plans for the franchise, which have ramped up significantly in recent years. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/silent-hill-f"><u>Silent Hill f</u></a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/silent-hill-townfall"><u>Silent Hill: Townfall</u></a> are both still in the works. Now we have Silent Hill remake. There's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/return-to-silent-hill-movie-first-look-pyramid-head"><u>a film adaptation of Silent Hill 2</u></a> coming, too.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dispatch-is-a-superhero-logistics-game.1216809/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/dispatch-demo<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I’m not really into superhero stories–as a tedious literalist, they often feel like metaphors for human struggles when I’d rather just watch regular people deal with that stuff. But the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2592160/Dispatch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Steam demo</a> for <em>Dispatch </em>is light on the parts of superhero media I like the least, instead focusing on learning the ropes of a new job, if that new job involved sending superheroes out to fight crime.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><em>Dispatch </em>follows Robert Robertson, a superhero who inadvertently destroyed his mechanical suit and has now been relegated to a desk job at the Superhero Dispatch Network, where he sends other heroes out on rescues. The members of his team have all committed crimes, and they’re all hostile to the whole setup, as well as to Robert. Alongside all this city-saving and superpowers, Robert deals with regular new job problems, like meeting his coworkers, office bathroom etiquette, and his own feelings about being behind-the-scenes instead of on the front lines.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Dispatch | Official Demo Trailer" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LJt-4YgRAng?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p><em>Dispatch</em> is made by AdHoc Studio, which contains folks who previously worked on games like <em>The Walking Dead </em>and <em>Tales From The Borderlands</em>. That pedigree shows through in the game’s quippy dialogue, though the demo is refreshingly largely free of the Whedonspeak that plagues the superhero genre. There are also some dialogue choice moments and even a “so-and-so will remember that” that hints at deeper relationships.</p><p>The dispatching aspect of the job takes place on Robert’s computer, where crimes pop up on a map of the city. You get a description of the mission–a hero is needed to climb a tree to get a kid’s balloon, and also not make the child cry–and then you have to pick which of your heroes would be best for the job based on a visualization of their stats. Picking the right hero to send is then a little puzzle of parsing the call’s description: in the balloon case, you'd want someone with good mobility to climb the tree, but also good charisma to handle the child. Once the mission is complete, you’re shown a visualization of the stat distribution the mission actually required, and you see how well your chosen hero’s stats lined up. If enough of your hero’s stat shape overlaps with the mission’s, you succeed.</p><figure></figure><p>This is made more complicated as more calls pop up, necessitating waiting for characters to return from missions and rest up before you can send them out again. At a couple points in the demo I didn’t have the best person for the job available, so just had to send someone and hope for the best. There’s also a pretty simple hacking minigame, and characters also have special attributes that didn’t figure too much into my demo experience but will surely play a role in the full game: characters who get stat boosts if they’re alone, a character who transforms into a monster and reverses some of his stats after coming back from a job.&nbsp;</p><p>It’s a lot to cram into a very short demo, much of which is taken up by table-setting dialogue about Robert’s backstory and the other characters at the Network. Being thrown into the deep end of the gameplay was a good way to get a sense of what <em>Dispatch</em> actually is, but also felt for me like a lot to take in at once. The lack of clarity regarding what stats a mission requires is a good way to keep the dispatching from just being some kind of fancied-up matching game, but a little more visual clarity might also help to keep things from feeling too much like guesswork and keep track of your team's stats better. But trying to make decisions with limited information and remember the details of your team, all while new calls pop up and Robert’s team argues with him and each other in the background, is hectic in an enjoyable way.</p><p>Currently, to replay the dispatching you’ll have to restart the demo and sit through the (well-written and well-acted) cutscenes again, something I hope the demo tweaks if it stays up past the current Steam Next Fest. I’d like to see if I could do better on my calls, managing my team more efficiently and making better decisions on the calls that require more hands-on participation than just choosing who to send. I’m intrigued by what <em>Dispatch</em> is shaping up to be, and the demo definitely got me excited to see more of it. It’s set for a 2025 release.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/dragon-age-the-veilguard-electronic-arts-sales-layoffs"><h3>Good Day To Everyone Except The Senior Management At Electronic Arts</h3></a><p>'The team was asked to change the game’s fundamental structure and recast the entire story on the fly'</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/best-indie-games-summer-game-fest-2025"><h3>Seven Cool Video Games I Saw During (Well, After) Summer Game Fest</h3></a><p>From LEGO to bicycles to...whatever the Yakuza guys are doing next</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/lies-of-p-overture-lost-save-game-pass"><h3>My Lies Of P Save File Is Dead And I Am Full Of Regret</h3></a><p>I love Lies of P, but trying to play Lies of P: Overture became a cautionary tale about Game Pass and personal data archiving.</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<section><p>The game's director said he's been dreaming of making a game like this since he was a child.</p></section>
        
        
                    
              <section>

                  
          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p dir="ltr">There were all kinds of games on display at Summer Game Fest 2025: scary games, thrilling games, funny games, but only one game was making everyone cry. I played a demo of the game alongside the developers, and I won't pretend otherwise: It messed me up, too. The incredibly moving experience came from my time with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/out-of-words/" data-ref-id="5000-681510">Out of Words</a>, the debut from the creative team of Kong Orange and WiredFly. In speaking with the team, I was moved by their emotional maturity and thoughtfulness. Out of Words is an adorable co-op puzzle-platformer, but more than that, it's an exercise in heart-on-your-sleeve vulnerability.</p><p dir="ltr">"I am a bit of a romantic," game director Johan Oettinger told me, describing the relationship between the game's playable characters, Karla and Kurt. Typically, "they can talk about anything. But they find themselves in a moment in their relationship with something new in the air." But sadly, Oettinger added, "they can't find the words" to say how they feel. Out of Words is a coming-of-age love story about the things we want to say but don't know how.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HSzA43ZQJ3Q" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/HSzA43ZQJ3Q" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">Something is in the way of them being honest with each other, and that premise, combined with Oettinger's soft-spoken way of speaking about this game he clearly loves so much, was already getting me pretty misty before I even played. It was like I'd walked into a poetry reading where, by chance, a demo of a gorgeous, stop-motion animated video game was also taking place.</p><p dir="ltr">"I love stop-motion," Oettinger told me, admitting it's like the "extreme sport of animation" due to how unforgiving it is. He explained to me that creating this game had been his dream since he was 11 years old, when he played The Neverhood, a 1996 stop-motion animated game developed in collaboration with Stephen Spielberg's Dreamworks. "All the cinematics [of Out of Words] are fully stop-motion, animated frame by frame in front of a camera. And everything in the world is also handcrafted. Every element you see, every picture you see, has literally been touched by a human being. The grass, the strings are cut out of paper with scissors. The little cliffs and surfaces and books are cut up and 3D-scanned, the surface of the water is cellophane, and so on."</p><p dir="ltr">As players explore the world, searching for the words to say what they need to say, they'll come to find the true antagonist: "doubt itself," as Oettinger put it. The mechanics of the game will change often to reflect the story. In a portion I played, Kurt and Karla had to learn to trust each other, sharing possession of a light that would help them float above gaps. At first we stumbled, vanishing into pits of darkness with every mistake. But soon, we were able to pass the light back and forth with dance-like chemistry, catching each other with well-choreographed trust falls. Whatever shape the gameplay takes as the story goes on, it's meant to be approachable for players of all skill levels. "The dream is that you're able to play with your child, or your non-gamer partner, your non-gamer parents, take them on this journey with you," game design lead Jeff Sparks told me.</p><blockquote><p dir="ltr">Art, for me, has to be deeply personal. That's where it gets honest, when it comes from personal experience.</p></blockquote><p dir="ltr">Morten Søndergaard, the game's poet--yes, that's his actual job title--met Oettinger in 2012, and the pair bonded over similar experiences and a shared vision. "I always wanted to make language something tangible," Søndergaard said. "I'm a little dyslexic, actually, and so I keep bumping into language. Language is something that bumps into me, and I bump into it. Meeting Johan and starting the work on Out of Words was a dream come true, to be able to be <em>in </em>language. [Karla and Kurt] are in language. And so they are going <em>through </em>language. And I think language is a trust system in a way, and language is also a game. Language is something we play with, 'play on words' and all that. So, it all comes together in this symphony of emotion."</p><p dir="ltr">"When Martin came to me with the idea of, 'Wouldn't it be cool to fall <em>into </em>language?' I fell in love, not only with Morton, but also with that idea," Oettinger added, "because I am dyslexic myself, and we've combined this with my love of coming-of-age and stop-motion, and it turned into the game I've been dreaming about making. I want to make something that, if I found this as an 11-year-old dyslexic boy, it could just show me, 'Okay, this is how language can be. It's not something a belittling teacher is trying to push into you.' Then I would have discovered so many things I love much earlier, and it would have opened my world. I could say to my mother, 'Look, mom, let's play this together. This is why I love games.'"</p><p dir="ltr">The room was getting weepy by this point, and the team had told me crying had been a running theme of Summer Game Fest in the Out of Words booth. Oettinger shared a touching example from earlier in the day where he was explaining the game to a translator who would then translate his words into Japanese for their colleague, and the translator couldn't help but cry as they reshaped the words, which to me seemed sweetly similar to what the game is trying to do itself; through this transformation came raw emotion.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4512361-g4lkvxzq.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4512361" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4512361-g4lkvxzq.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4512361"></a><figcaption>Out of Words has been in development for years, but the game's director told GameSpot it's actually been his dream to make this game for most of his life.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4512361-g4lkvxzq.jpeg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Everyone was being so sincere and vulnerable, and it was quite unlike any video game demo I've ever been a part of, to be totally forthcoming. I believe emotional vulnerability is the purest form of beauty. When people, especially two people together, can open themselves up to potentially be hurt but are instead rewarded for their honesty with the other person's empathy and acceptance, it's one of the most extraordinary things that can happen to us as human beings. I'm elated to see a game taking on this idea with such a delicate hand and artful eye. Suffice it to say, by the time my 40 minutes with the team was nearing its end, I knew it would go down as one of my favorite experiences I've had in my career.</p><p dir="ltr">"Art, for me, has to be deeply personal. That's where it gets honest, when it comes from personal experience. I mean, the moment there," Oettinger said, pointing to an image of the main characters, "I think we all have our story of that moment where we can't find the words. And in my case, a girl is standing there in front of me, and Karla is, of course, based on that girl from when I was that age, Sarah, and maybe that's a little Johan," he hinted, "and I lost her. She was my best friend. In that moment where I couldn't find the words, what if I could fix the inner language, and then I could say what I wanted?"</p><p dir="ltr">Out of Words comes out in 2026 on Epic Games Store, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S. Co-op will be playable locally or online with cross-play, making it easy to bring the Kurt or Karla from your own life into the game with you.</p>

                <p>MindsEye, the new action game from former Rockstar veteran Leslie Benzies' new studio, launched this week but left a lot to be desired due to technical and performance issues.

            <p>The team at <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mindseye">MindsEye</a> studio Build A Rocket Boy is "heartbroken that not every player was able to experience the game as we intended," it has said, promising more fixes throughout June.</p>
<p>MindsEye released earlier this week, however it wasn't the smoothest of launches. Many found themselves presented with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mindseye-launches-with-myriad-of-glitches-and-issues-as-developer-promises-performance-update">distorting character bugs and stuttering issues when they booted up the game</a>. Build A Rocket Boy released a statement yesterday, when it said it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mindseye-hotfix-planned-for-pc-this-week-but-console-players-may-have-to-wait">would be prioritising gameplay performance with an update</a>.</p>
<p>"Our teams have worked tirelessly throughout the night to solve many of these issues, and we have now identified that the vast majority of crashes were caused by a memory leak," the developer has since shared on the MindsEye Discord, adding roughly one in 10 players were impacted.</p>

<p>"We have developed a hotfix that addresses this issue (alongside other issues that our players have highlighted), which we are working hard to deploy as soon as tomorrow on PC and on consoles once it passes certification with PlayStation and Xbox," it continued, stating the team is "fully committed to ensuring all players have a great experience".</p>

<p>MindsEye has had an unusual lead up to launch, it has to be said. At the end of May, the studio's co-CEO suggested the<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mindseye-boss-claims-games-negative-reaction-ahead-of-release-has-been-paid-for-in-concerted-effort-against-studio"> game's negative reaction up until that point had been paid for in a "concerted effort" against the developer</a>. This is something <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/io-interactive">IO Interactive</a>, which serves as the game's publisher, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mindseye-boss-claims-games-negative-reaction-ahead-of-release-has-been-paid-for-in-concerted-effort-against-studio">doesn't believe to be the case</a>.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mindseye-studio-execs-depart-build-a-rocket-boy-one-week-before-games-debut">the studio's Chief Legal Officer and Chief Financial Officer left the company</a>, just one week before MindsEye released.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Mode director Yu Sahara, who’s worked on <em>Metal Gear </em>in the past, distinguished it from <em>Metal Gear Online</em>, a multiplayer spin-off of <em>Metal Gear Solid 4 </em>that featured tactical stealth takes on traditional scenarios like team deathmatch and capture the flag.</p><p>“The landscape of multiplayer games has changed a lot,” he said during the livestream. Indeed it has, but the most appealing about Metal Gear getting multiplayer again is how old-school it might end up feeling compared to the current glut of extraction shooters, battle royales,and battle passes. Here’s a quick teaser from the showcase:</p><p>Instead of bringing that back, Sahara and the team at Konami worked on updating what <em>Metal Gear Online </em>might look like decades later. The focus will still be on camouflage and staying hidden before choosing the right time to go after an objective or surprise an opponent, and footage in a brief teaser showed characters getting into what look like small D-Walker-type mechs on the battlefield. Also lots of operatives crawling around in leaf shrouds. </p><p>Konami didn’t have anything else to reveal about the mode other than it will be arriving with the rest of <em>Metal Gear Solid Delta</em> at launch on August 28. In addition to Fox Hunt, the remake also features a Snake vs. Bomberman mode and one where he has to round-up monkeys from Ape Escape. Despite the new content, however, much of the base game appears to be an exceedingly faithful retread of the 2000s-era stealth thriller, just with modern controls and other tweaks to make it more approachable for new audiences. The original is still available to play as part of the <em>Metal Gear Solid: Master Collection</em> released back in 2023. </p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
