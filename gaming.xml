            <p>
ack in March, Diablo 4 became the first Activision Blizzard title to join Xbox Game Pass post-Microsoft's acquisition of the publisher, and it looks like the floodgates are finally starting to open; Crash Bandicoot N. Sane Trilogy is reportedly set to hit the subscription service this August, with more Activision games coming "very soon".
</p>
<p>
That's according to reliable leaker eXtas1s who, <a href="https://forums.exputer.com/threads/exclusive-new-details-regarding-activision-games-coming-to-xbox-game-pass-emerge.222/">writing on eXputer</a>, claims to have spoken to sources and seen "certain graphic evidence" pointing to Game Pass releases for a number of Activision titles in the not-too-distant future. eXtas1s' most specific claim is that of Crash Bandicoot N. Sane Trilogy's August arrival - since <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/report-crash-bandicoot-n-sane-trilogy-is-coming-to-xbox-game-pass-in-august">corroborated by Windows Central</a> - but there's reportedly more on the way.
</p>
<p>
eXtas1s says Activision's Tony Hawk 1+2 remake and Spyro Reignited Trilogy are also heading to Game Pass - and while they "cannot guarantee" the titles will arrive alongside Crash Bandicoot, they're both reportedly joining the subscription service "very soon".

To date, Microsoft has only <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-2024-will-launch-into-xbox-game-pass-microsoft-has-reportedly-decided">confirmed one Activision Blizzard title for Game Pass</a> beyond Diablo 4 - this year's Call of Duty: Black Ops 6, which is set to be a release day addition to the catalogue on 25th October, just over a year after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-has-finally-bought-activision-blizzard">Microsoft's $69bn acquisition of Activision was made official</a>. Last year, Xbox boss Phil Spencer warned fans the publisher's titles <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-boss-blames-lengthy-buyout-process-for-delay-in-adding-activision-blizzard-titles-to-game-pass">wouldn't start showing up on Game Pass until 2024</a>, blaming the holdup on "a lot of uncertainty" around the buyout process.
</p>
<p>
But with the wheels seemingly now in motion, it hopefully won't be long before Microsoft and Activision finally give the masses exactly what they've been clamouring for: every Zork title on Game Pass for PC. Until then, there's always <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-game-pass-lineup-for-july-2024-announced">July's Xbox Game Pass additions</a>, including the likes of Journey to the Savage Planet, Tchia, Neon White, and The Case of the Golden Idol.

The dock can also back up save game data or easily extract photos captured by the Game Boy Camera.</p><p>Epilogue, the company behind it, shared a short video of the new feature on X and <a href="https://www.timeextension.com/news/2024/07/the-gb-operator-turns-your-game-boy-camera-into-the-worst-and-best-webcam-youll-ever-have">told <em>Time Extension</em></a>, “We now have a live feed from the Game Boy Camera, but still need to fine-tune some things and allow for configuration options.”</p><p>It also described the new feature as “the worst and the best webcam you’ll ever have.”</p><p>A previous attempt at <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DgSWPvqUGIto">turning the Game Boy Camera into a webcam</a> required a stack of hardware, including a Super Nintendo, a Super Game Boy cartridge, a device to convert a composite video signal to HDMI, and a video capture card for a PC. Epilogue’s solution looks much simpler and nearly painless — except for those forced to see their co-workers livestreamed through a relic of digital photography.</p><p>In addition to the Game Boy-focused GB Operator, Epilogue recently shared the first images of its upcoming SN Operator, which offers the same functionality and PC connectivity but for Super Nintendo cartridges. There are currently no details on when the SN Operator will be released, and “coming soon” is the only timeline shared for the GB Operator upgrades.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/2024-gama-horizons-fellowship-offers-grants-to-diverse-creators-and-businesses<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The Game Manufacturer's Association (GAMA) has opened applications for its annual diversity drive. Officially called the GAMA Horizons Fellowship, the program will provide grants and support to tabletop publishers and retailers from marginalized groups.</p>
<h2>The 2024 GAMA Horizons Fellowship program</h2>
<p>According to a report by <a href="https://boardgamewire.com/index.php/2024/07/02/gamas-annual-diversity-drive-opens-offering-1000-grants-convention-support-to-fledgling-board-game-publishers-retailers/">Board Game Wire</a>, the GAMA Horizons Fellowship is an eight-month accelerator program. It will offer $1,000 grants and support to creators and retailers from historically sidelined demographics, including race, ethnicity, gender, sexual orientation, religion, and ability.</p>

<p>The program is open to new or prospective US and Canada-based board game publishers. The companies must be at least 51% owned or operated by people from the above-mentioned demographics.</p>
<p>Successful GAMA Horizons Fellowship program applicants will get more than just money. Those select few will receive mentoring and peer coaching, a one-year complementary GAMA membership, free admission, and booth opps at GAMA Expo and Origins 2025 with travel and lodging included, and access to virtual classes from industry veterans.</p>
<p>For those wishing to get their foot in the door of the tabletop industry, GAMA is one of the biggest organizations in the business. In addition to hosting two major board game conventions, they assist publishers and retailers in all assets of development and marketing. This organization can make <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/jon-del-arroz-suspended-from-gama" rel="noopener" target="_blank">or break</a> one's career in the tabletop space.</p>
<p>The report ends with testimonials of earlier GAMA Horizons Fellowship program applicants. Golden Lasso Games' Kimi Hughes stated it "opened up a whole new world of knowledge and connections."</p>
<p>PlayForge's Jesse Stommel provided a similar anecdote. He mentions the difficulty of management during the COVID-19 pandemic as well as his struggles being queer and disabled and how the program let him find invaluable people that were in his corner.</p>
<p>Further details on how to apply to the GAMA Horizons Fellowship program can be <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1aH3DCXoDIOTnQcIGOTtcwa3KdwHSovSWLYjGumk74Dg/edit">found here</a>.</p>

Instead, I’ve rounded up an eclectic mix of 4th of July gaming deals and culturally adjacent curios that happen to be discounted right now. Check them out.

If you want something more fancy, you’re also in luck. While you could spend thousands on a truly top-of the line TV with blacks as dark as an event horizon, you could also splurge on a 48-inch LG OLED. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.bestbuy.com/site/lg-48-class-b4-series-oled-4k-uhd-smart-webos-tv/6584787.p?skuId=6584787&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/lg-48-class-b4-series-oled-4k-uhd-smart-webos-tv/6584787.p?skuId=6584787" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Best Buy is also selling those</a></span> for just $800 (almost 50 percent off the sticker price). </p><h2 id="h184420"><a id=""></a>Best Used Game Sales</h2><p>GameStop is currently running a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.gamestop.com/search/?pmid=30006&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.gamestop.com/search/?pmid=30006" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">buy 2, get 1 free on all used games</a></span>, including its (very limited) retro collection. It’s great way to catch up on bargain bin stuff you might have never gotten to (<em>Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order</em>, <em>Watch Dogs 2</em>, <em>GTA V</em>) as well as more recent stuff that hasn’t dropped in value yet. For example, you could play some of 2024's biggest games so far like <em>Final Fantasy VII: Rebirth</em>, <em>Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door</em>, and <em>Tekken 8</em> and save roughly $50 in the process. Have fun mixing and matching. Just make sure they actually have used copies of the games in stock. </p><h2 id="h184421"><a id=""></a>The Best Of The Rest </h2><p>Here’s where we have fun with a rapid-fire round of some other neat deals:</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><strong>3 Months of Xbox Game Pass</strong> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://electronics.woot.com/offers/digital-code-xbox-game-pass-ultimate-1&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://electronics.woot.com/offers/digital-code-xbox-game-pass-ultimate-1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">for $35 (24 percent off)</a></span></li><li><strong>Xbox Series X/S controller </strong><span><a data-ga="[]" href="https://www.amazon.com/Xbox-Core-Wireless-Controller-Deep-Controllers/dp/B08K4HLCPR?asc_campaign=kinjakotakulink-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://kotaku.com/4th-july-gaming-deals-nintendo-switch-tvs-amazon-1851576442&amp;asc_source=&amp;tag=kinjakotakulink-20" target="_blank" rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer nofollow noskim" data-amazonasin="B08K4HLCPR" data-amazontag="kinjakotakulink-20">for $47 (22 percent off)</a></span></li><li><strong>Sony INZONE H3 Wired Headset </strong><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.bestbuy.com/site/sony-inzone-h3-wired-gaming-headset-white/6510365.p?skuId=6510365&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.bestbuy.com/site/sony-inzone-h3-wired-gaming-headset-white/6510365.p?skuId=6510365" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">for $60 (40 percent off)</a></span></li><li><strong><em>Seven Samurai </em>4k Blu-ray</strong> <span><a data-ga="[]" href="https://www.amazon.com/Seven-Samurai-Criterion-Collection-Blu-ray/dp/B003KGBISY?asc_campaign=kinjakotakulink-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://kotaku.com/4th-july-gaming-deals-nintendo-switch-tvs-amazon-1851576442&amp;asc_source=&amp;tag=kinjakotakulink-20" target="_blank" rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer nofollow noskim" data-amazonasin="B003KGBISY" data-amazontag="kinjakotakulink-20">for $20 (50 percent off in the Criterion sale</a></span>)</li><li><strong><em>Dragon Ball: A Visual History </em></strong><span><a data-ga="[]" href="https://www.amazon.com/Dragon-Ball-History-Akira-Toriyama/dp/1974707407?asc_campaign=kinjakotakulink-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://kotaku.com/4th-july-gaming-deals-nintendo-switch-tvs-amazon-1851576442&amp;asc_source=&amp;tag=kinjakotakulink-20" target="_blank" rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer nofollow noskim" data-amazonasin="1974707407" data-amazontag="kinjakotakulink-20">for $25 (38 percent off)</a></span></li><li><strong><em>Disney Lorcana </em>Into the Inklands Booster Box</strong> <span><a data-ga="[]" href="https://www.amazon.com/Ravensburger-Disney-Lorcana-TCG-Enthusiasts/dp/B0CFRDMPWZ?asc_campaign=kinjakotakulink-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://kotaku.com/4th-july-gaming-deals-nintendo-switch-tvs-amazon-1851576442&amp;asc_source=&amp;tag=kinjakotakulink-20" target="_blank" rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer nofollow noskim" data-amazonasin="B0CFRDMPWZ" data-amazontag="kinjakotakulink-20">for $98 (32 percent off)</a></span></li><li><strong><em>The Lord of the Rings Ilustrated Trilogy</em></strong><span><a data-ga="[]" href="https://www.amazon.com/Lord-Rings-Illustrated-J-R-R-Tolkien/dp/0358653037/?asc_campaign=kinjakotakulink-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://kotaku.com/4th-july-gaming-deals-nintendo-switch-tvs-amazon-1851576442&amp;asc_source=&amp;tag=kinjakotakulink-20" target="_blank" rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer nofollow noskim" data-amazonasin="0358653037" data-amazontag="kinjakotakulink-20"> for $39 (56 percent off)</a></span></li><li><strong>Hori Nintendo Switch Pikachu Adventure Bag</strong> <span><a data-ga="[]" href="https://www.amazon.com/Nintendo-Switch-Adventure-Pack-Pikachu-Travel/dp/B07WWZZBSQ?asc_campaign=kinjakotakulink-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://kotaku.com/4th-july-gaming-deals-nintendo-switch-tvs-amazon-1851576442&amp;asc_source=&amp;tag=kinjakotakulink-20" target="_blank" rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer nofollow noskim" data-amazonasin="B07WWZZBSQ" data-amazontag="kinjakotakulink-20">for $25 (17 percent off)</a></span></li><li><strong>Nintendo Switch Lite</strong> <span><a data-ga="[]" href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B07V4GCFP9?asc_campaign=kinjakotakulink-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://kotaku.com/4th-july-gaming-deals-nintendo-switch-tvs-amazon-1851576442&amp;asc_source=&amp;tag=kinjakotakulink-20" target="_blank" rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer nofollow noskim" data-amazonasin="B07V4GCFP9" data-amazontag="kinjakotakulink-20">for $184 (8 percent off) </a></span></li></ul><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><strong>Pokémon TCG: Scarlet &amp;

Now that the deal is finalized, Xbox owns a ton of franchises and games, including <em>Call of Duty, Warcraft, </em>and <em>Candy Crush. </em>But so far, eight months after the deal was completed, only one Activision game—<em>Diablo IV</em>—has made its way onto Game Pass. However, it appears more are finally on the way. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/report-crash-bandicoot-n-sane-trilogy-is-coming-to-xbox-game-pass-in-august&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/report-crash-bandicoot-n-sane-trilogy-is-coming-to-xbox-game-pass-in-august" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">According to a report by <em>Windows Central</em></a></span> on July 3, <em>Crash Bandicoot N.

                <p>Early into <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/stardew-valley/" data-ref-id="5000-168503">Stardew Valley</a>, Willy will give you a fishing pole, which unlocks fishing. Fishing is a big part of Stardew Valley and a great way to make money early on in the game, but there are a few mechanics you won't be able to use right away. One of those mechanics is bait, which can be used to cause fish to bite faster.</p><h2 dir="ltr">How to use bait</h2><p>The reason you can't use bait right away is that the Bamboo Pole Willy gives you doesn't have the ability to use bait. Instead, you will need to upgrade to the next tier of fishing pole, the <strong>Fiberglass Rod</strong>, which has a slot for bait. The Fiberglass Rod costs 1,800G and is unavailable until you reach Fishing Level 2, which will require you to do some fishing. Every fishing rod you unlock after this point will have a bait slot. Bait is also used in Crab Pots, which will only catch something if it has a piece of bait in it, and which you have to refill. Holding bait and interacting with the Crab Pot will place it inside.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1599/15997278/4328667-bait.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4328667" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1599/15997278/4328667-bait.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4328667"></a><figcaption>Once you get a fishing pole that has a bait slot, you can equip bait directly from your inventory.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1599/15997278/4328667-bait.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">The fishing rod itself can have the bait added directly to your inventory by moving it to the fishing rod. Fishing rods can hold a large amount of bait, so you don't have to reload in between fish.</p><h2 dir="ltr">How to get bait</h2><p dir="ltr">Fishing bait can be obtained in multiple ways. There is the default bait, along with some specialized versions, which can be crafted using bug meat and other items after leveling up your Fishing skill. Bug Meat is acquired by defeating bug enemies in the mines. You can also craft a Worm Bin, which unlocks at Fishing Level 4, which will periodically produce bait. It can occasionally be found in treasure chests found while fishing and Willy sells it in his shop.</p>

                <p>Oftentimes, the most challenging part of playing <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/minecraft/" data-ref-id="5000-73990">Minecraft</a> is when you spawn into a world for the first time. That's because you come into the world with nothing, and things can quickly become overwhelming if you don't already have a plan in mind. Heck, you won't even have a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-to-make-a-map-in-minecraft/1100-6524696/" data-ref-id="1100-6524696">map</a> yet. One of the first things you'll want to do is build a house as soon as possible. Thankfully, your first house doesn't need to be anything fancy. It just needs the bare minimum to live. This guide will break down everything you'll need to know about building the best starter house in Minecraft.</p><h2>Break Trees</h2><p dir="ltr">Minecraft will start you off near trees when you spawn for the first time. You'll want to use this to your advantage. The first thing you'll want to do is begin breaking down many trees by punching them and collecting the wood that's left behind. Once you've collected enough wood, you'll want to convert it into <strong>Wood Planks</strong>. Don't worry because you can do this without a <strong>Crafting Table</strong>.</p><h2>Build a small house</h2><p dir="ltr">Now that you've collected enough wood, you'll want to build a small house where you can stay. The size of it doesn't matter, but <strong>we recommend starting with a 5x4 size</strong>. Don't worry about making specific rooms. Make sure you have enough room to store all the essentials. While making your house, it's important to mention that you should <strong>hold off on the roof until you've placed a few torches</strong> around to ensure hostile mobs don't spawn inside.</p><h2>Make a Crafting Table</h2><p dir="ltr">The second you build the foundation for your tiny house, find a nice little corner and make a Crafting Table. To do this, <strong>open up the inventory menu and place four Wood Planks in the four slots, and you'll be able to make the table</strong>.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1746/17463818/4328762-minecraftstarterhouse.png" data-ref-id="1300-4328762" data-ratio="0.62133333333333" data-width="375" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1746/17463818/4328762-minecraftstarterhouse.png" data-ref-id="1300-4328762"></a><figcaption>Here's how you make a crafting table.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1746/17463818/4328762-minecraftstarterhouse.png"></figure><h2>Craft a bed</h2><p dir="ltr">Once you've built your house, you'll want to venture off and look for some sheep to craft a bed. You'll need to kill the sheep and collect their Wool. Once you have <strong>three of the same color Wool, open up the inventory menu and place all three in the crafting section alongside three Wood Planks to craft a bed</strong>.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1746/17463818/4328763-minecraftstarterhouse3.png" data-ref-id="1300-4328763" data-ratio="0.42020497803807" data-width="683" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1746/17463818/4328763-minecraftstarterhouse3.png" data-ref-id="1300-4328763"></a><figcaption>Nothing beats a good night's rest.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1746/17463818/4328763-minecraftstarterhouse3.png"></figure><p>All that's left for you to do now is place the bed inside your home and <strong>lay down on it to set your respawn location</strong>. This means you'll reappear here whenever you die, so long as it's your most recent respawn location.<strong><br></strong></p><h2>Get to crafting</h2><p dir="ltr">Now that you have a bed, you'll need to craft some other essential items. Here's what to focus on next:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Double Chest (Place two regular chests side by side)</li><li dir="ltr">Sticks</li><li dir="ltr">Wood Door</li><li dir="ltr">Wood Weapons/Tools</li></ul><p dir="ltr">All the items mentioned above don't require anything other than wood. So don't worry about needing other supplies just yet. Trees will continue to be your go-to for these projects.</p><h2>Collect cobblestone and build a furnace</h2><p dir="ltr">Once you've crafted one of every wooden tool, you'll first want to use the <strong>Wood Pickaxe to mine cobblestone</strong>. Cobblestone can be easily found anywhere. If you're having a hard time finding some, all you need to do is dig down, and after destroying a few dirt blocks, you'll run into it.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>You'll only need to collect a total of eight cobblestones</strong>, but it doesn't hurt to have a few extras. Now that you have the cobblestones, place them on the crafting table, and put <strong>eight of the blocks in the crafting menu to make a furnace</strong>.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1746/17463818/4328764-minecraftstarterhouse4.png" data-ref-id="1300-4328764" data-ratio="0.4029197080292" data-width="685" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1746/17463818/4328764-minecraftstarterhouse4.png" data-ref-id="1300-4328764"></a><figcaption>Here's how a furnace is made</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1746/17463818/4328764-minecraftstarterhouse4.png"></figure><h2>Craft torches and place them around</h2><p dir="ltr">There are two different ways to craft torches, but to keep things simple, you'll want to <strong>use any Wood Logs</strong>. Go to the furnace you placed in your house, and place the wood in both the top and bottom slots. <strong>This will start the process of creating Charcoal</strong>.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1746/17463818/4328766-minecraftstarterhouse5.png" data-ref-id="1300-4328766" data-ratio="0.43888070692194" data-width="679" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1746/17463818/4328766-minecraftstarterhouse5.png" data-ref-id="1300-4328766"></a><figcaption>Here's how to make Charcoal.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1746/17463818/4328766-minecraftstarterhouse5.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">Once you feel like you've created enough, grab some sticks and <strong>place both sticks and charcoal in an empty crafting slot to make Torches</strong>.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1746/17463818/4328767-minecraftstarterhouse6.png" data-ref-id="1300-4328767" data-ratio="0.42120765832106" data-width="679" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1746/17463818/4328767-minecraftstarterhouse6.png" data-ref-id="1300-4328767"></a><figcaption>Here's how to make Torches.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1746/17463818/4328767-minecraftstarterhouse6.png"></figure><h2 dir="ltr">Build a roof</h2><p dir="ltr">The last part is pretty simple. Now that you have everything you need in your starter house complete the roof and place a few torches on top to ensure hostile mobs don't spawn at night.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1746/17463818/4328768-minecraftstarterhouse7.png" data-ref-id="1300-4328768" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1746/17463818/4328768-minecraftstarterhouse7.png" data-ref-id="1300-4328768"></a><figcaption>It ain't much, but it'll get the job done. (Animal mobs not included)</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1746/17463818/4328768-minecraftstarterhouse7.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">Now that you've done that, your starter house is complete!

                <p>Maps are crucial if you have long-term plans to play in any <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/minecraft/" data-ref-id="5000-73990">Minecraft </a>world. As the name suggests, maps allow you to chart specific areas in the world so that you always know how to get to certain locations. Luckily, making them is fairly straightforward, but they won't operate as intended if you make them wrong. Don't worry; this guide details everything you need about crafting and using a map.</p><h2>How to craft a map</h2><p dir="ltr">To craft a map, you need the following items first: <strong>one compass and eight papers</strong>. As soon as you get your hands on those items, go to a Crafting Table, and you should see an option that'll allow you to make one. But if it doesn't appear, you'll want to place all the items, as shown in the picture below.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1746/17463818/4328748-howtomakeamapinminecraft.png" data-ref-id="1300-4328748" data-ratio="0.41399416909621" data-width="686" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1746/17463818/4328748-howtomakeamapinminecraft.png" data-ref-id="1300-4328748"></a><figcaption>Here's how you make a map in Minecraft</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1746/17463818/4328748-howtomakeamapinminecraft.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">It's also worth mentioning there's another way of crafting a map. To do this, all you'll need is <strong>nine papers</strong>. Once you have all nine, place them on a craft table and make the map as usual. What's unique about this map is that it won't have a player tracker. This type of map is known as an <strong>Empty Map</strong>. Instead, it'll just be a map of the general area, as shown in the picture below.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1746/17463818/4328751-howtomakeamapinminecraft2.png" data-ref-id="1300-4328751" data-ratio="0.40882352941176" data-width="680" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1746/17463818/4328751-howtomakeamapinminecraft2.png" data-ref-id="1300-4328751"></a><figcaption>Here is how you make an Empty Map.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1746/17463818/4328751-howtomakeamapinminecraft2.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">If you accidentally make a map like this, don't worry; it can easily be fixed. You only need to craft a compass and go to a crafting table with both items. Now that you're there, all you need to do is place both items in the crafting menu with a player tracker.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1746/17463818/4328756-image%281%29.png" data-ref-id="1300-4328756" data-ratio="0.41167883211679" data-width="685" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1746/17463818/4328756-image%281%29.png" data-ref-id="1300-4328756"></a><figcaption>Easy fix.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1746/17463818/4328756-image%281%29.png"></figure><h2>How to upgrade a map</h2><p dir="ltr">One of the first things you'll notice as soon as you make a map is how small it is. Don't worry, though, because <strong>it can be increased in size up to four times</strong> with the right supplies. To do this, you'll need to use a <strong>Cartography Table.</strong></p><p dir="ltr">Now that you're there, you'll need to place the map you have in the top left slot and a piece of paper in the bottom left slot. Once you do that, you'll pick the new map appearing in the middle right slot.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1746/17463818/4328759-howtomakeamapinminecraft5.png" data-ref-id="1300-4328759" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1746/17463818/4328759-howtomakeamapinminecraft5.png" data-ref-id="1300-4328759"></a><figcaption>Here's how you upgrade your map.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1746/17463818/4328759-howtomakeamapinminecraft5.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">The moment you grab it, the map will be increased, and more ground will be covered. To upgrade to level four, all you need to do is repeat the cycle.</p><p dir="ltr">You can also name your map from the Cartography Table, <strong>but note that doing so will not give you any gameplay advantage</strong>.</p><h2>How to copy a map</h2><p dir="ltr">It's also worth noting that you can copy any map. To do this, you'll need to use a <strong>Cartography Table </strong>again.</p><p dir="ltr">When you get there, place your map on the top left slot and place an Empty Map on the bottom left. After you do that, you'll see a map icon appear on the middle right slot with the number two next to it.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1746/17463818/4328760-howtomakeamapinminecraft6.png" data-ref-id="1300-4328760" data-ratio="0.74852941176471" data-width="680" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1746/17463818/4328760-howtomakeamapinminecraft6.png" data-ref-id="1300-4328760"></a><figcaption>Here is how you copy a map.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1746/17463818/4328760-howtomakeamapinminecraft6.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">You can grab both maps and give one to a friend or store the other for safekeeping.

                <p>Assassin's Creed Shadows arrives on November 15, offering up a sprawling world to explore and two playable characters for you to master. If you're a longtime Assassin's Creed fan, consider pairing your preorder with the upcoming <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/1506746047?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Assassin's Creed Shadows art book</a>, which arrives just a few days after the video game on November 19. The Art of Assassin's Creed Shadows contains over 250 pages of art and commentary and should serve as a cool companion for the game. It's pretty rare for a video game art book to release alongside the game. The hardcover book is available in two formats--<a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/1506746047?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">standard</a> or <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/1506745148?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">deluxe</a>--and both are now up for preorder ahead of their launch this holiday season.</p><h2>The Art of Assassin's Creed Shadows</h2><h3>$50</h3><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4328501-shadowscover.png" data-ref-id="1300-4328501" data-ratio="0.563" data-width="1000" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4328501-shadowscover.png" data-ref-id="1300-4328501"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4328501-shadowscover.png"></figure><p>This hardcover art book is 256 pages long and is published by Dark Horse Books. The company has a history of producing high-quality collectibles, and The Art of Assassin's Creed Shadows should be no different. The team at Ubisoft worked with Dark Horse Books to pull together "an art book in the tradition of the world-spanning Brotherhood, aiming to satisfy and inspire shinobi assassin and samurai of all generations." In other words, this aims to be a comprehensive book that touches on all major aspects of the game. If you preorder now, you'll get the lowest price offered between the time you order and release--you won't be charged until Amazon ships your book.</p><hr><h2>The Art of Assassin's Creed Shadows (Deluxe Edition)</h2><h3>$95 ($<del>100</del>)</h3><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4328502-61llnatc3fl._sl1500%281%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4328502" data-ratio="0.563" data-width="1000" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4328502-61llnatc3fl._sl1500%281%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4328502"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4328502-61llnatc3fl._sl1500%281%29.jpg"></figure><p>The deluxe edition is seeing a slight discount ahead of launch, and it’s a nice upgrade from the standard edition. This version also clocks in at 256 pages, though it's loaded with exclusive packaging and additional accessories, such as a decorative slipcase and a portfolio with a gallery-quality print. Just like with the standard edition, you'll pay the lowest price Amazon offers until launch when your order ships.</p><hr><p>If you haven't <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-preorder-guide-collectors-edition-release-date-bonuses/1100-6523479/" data-ref-id="1100-6523479">preordered Assassin's Creed Shadows</a>, you'll find tons of retailer-exclusive offers in our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-preorder-guide-collectors-edition-release-date-bonuses/1100-6523479/" data-ref-id="1100-6523479">Assassin's Creed Shadows preorder guide</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/tekkens-katsuhiro-harada-says-the-developers-actually-love-anna-despite-what-fans-think<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Harada put some respect on Anna's name. </h2></div><section><p>Tekken 8 director Katsuhiro Harada's official X/Twitter account has quickly become the fighting game community town square thanks in part to his extra long behind-the-scenes trivia posts and <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/tekken-8-director-katsuhiro-harada-has-more-questions-about-waffle-house">occasional Waffle House asides</a>. Harada's latest bit of Tekken lore dump put to bed a long-running fandom perception that Tekken devs have always hated Anna Williams. </p><p>In an impromptu Q&amp;A X/Twitter post, Harada responded to a fan's question about the relationship dynamic between Nina and Anna. In his <a href="https://x.com/harada_tekken/status/1808400818837901531?s=46" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>1,317-word response</u></a> — which was written during his lunch break — Harada also addressed the community rumor about Tekken devs hating Anna by stating the exact opposite. </p><p>"By the way, there is a small group of people who believe that Anna is not loved by the development team and they even say that Anna is hated [by the] dev team," Harada wrote. "Well, it doesn't matter, Because it's NOT true at all, but the Anna portrayed in the story of TEKKEN is filled with a lot of thoughts and feelings from me and the animation staff."</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/07/03/anna-1720032586737.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Anna Williams In Tekken 7.</figcaption></figure></output><p>For those unversed in the melodramatic soap opera that is fighting game story modes, Tekken's long-running narrative can be boiled down as a family drama playing out in a series of high-stakes martial arts tournaments. While the epicenter of the series' familial beef involves the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/tekken-8s-final-character-reveal-is-reina-perhaps-the-spiritual-successor-to-heihachi"><u>Mishima family's ever-increasing family tree</u></a>, Anna and Nina Williams serve as Tekken's tertiary rivalry. Some FGC players have felt Tekken developers heavily favor Nina as the series' golden child in that rivalry and view Anna as its black sheep. </p><p>Much of the Tekken fandom's perception of Anna being disliked by its developers was instilled by the number of times Nina would trounce Anna in a myriad of cutscenes and win quotes throughout the series. This perception also wasn't helped by the fact that Nina Williams is more often than not guaranteed as a launch character in Tekken game rosters, including Tekken 8. In contrast, Anna was allocated as a <a href="https://www.ign.com/videos/tekken-7-season-pass-2-launch-trailer">DLC character in Tekken 7</a> and has yet to be announced in Tekken 8. </p><p>In the post, Harada revealed that he mainly worked on the development of Anna in Tekken 3 and that he personally created the names of her moves.</p><p>"Originally, Nina was very popular with players since the beginning of Tekken. There is a yin and yang to things, and Anna's popularity was often contrasted with Nina's," Harada said. "Back in Tekken 1 and 2, many mid-boss characters were 'convertible character' to other characters, but we wanted to make Anna from Tekken 3 as unique as possible to gain popularity."</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/07/03/anna-nina-1720032652759.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Anna And Nina Clashing In Tekken 7.</figcaption></figure></output><p>Harada also acknowledged the gap in the sister's popularity throughout the years and took the position that even when Nina outshines Anna like a one-sided episode of Tom and Jerry, the team made sure <a href="https://youtu.be/Lry3FzA8uBw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Anna's charms shone through for players</a>. </p><p>"For this reason, Anna's settings in the game reflect the feelings of the people in charge of Anna on our development team. For example, Anna's settings include the following: "Anna is tired of losing not only the battle with Nina, but also the popularity ranking in the Iron Fist Tournament. I believe that was the very sentiment of those of us in charge of Anna (myself, the animation team, and the modeling team)," Harada added. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/07/03/vs-youtube-tekken7-seasonpass2revealfeaturingneganfromamcsthewalkingdeadps4x1pc-143-2-1720033071911.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Anna Blowing Nina Up With A Rocket Launcher.</figcaption></figure></output><p>Harada concluded his huge Anna and Nina Williams lore dump with a list of triva about their relationship that basically doubled down agaisnt the miconception that Anna is completely washed in comparison to her sister. Here are some of the notable bits of pro-Anna trivia:</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Anna is a better cook than Nina</li><li>Anna is better at darts</li><li>Anna is better with heavy weaponry like an anti-tank rocket launcher</li><li>Nina only assassinated Anna's fiance in Tekken 7 (and stole her wedding dress) because her would-be hubby had a "very dark side" that Anna wasn't aware of. Nina is also awaiting a thank you from Nina for the trouble. </li></ul><p>In <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/tekken-8-review"><u>our review</u></a> of Tekken 8, we gave the game a 9/10, saying, "Tekken 8 is an incredible evolution for the series, with tons of single player content, an excellent suite of training tools, a great online experience, and exciting new mechanics that make Tekken more dynamic than ever."</p><p>Isaiah Colbert is a freelance writer for IGN.

			<p>Today, DICE has <a href="https://x.com/Battlefield/status/1808516412819861814" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> a limited-time Battlefield 2042 crossover event with another franchise under EA's portfolio: Dead Space. The mode is called Outbreak and will run for a week (Tuesday, July 9-16). Here's the official brief provided in the press release:</p>
<p><em>In Outbreak, the human resilience and resourcefulness of the squad will be tested against a new and relentless enemy as they attempt to escape the Boreas lab.</em></p>
<p><em>Players can unlock free rewards for participating in this unique collaboration, including a new weapon charm and skin, as well as a new player card background and tag. This collaboration also includes a Dead Space bundle that includes a legendary "Marked Man" Specialist Outfit, 3 legendary weapon skins, and more. The bundle can be purchased for 2200 BFC.</em></p>

<p>Battlefield 2042 famously disappointed when it launched in November 2021, becoming the lowest-rated installment in the popular shooter franchise. However, DICE stuck with it for a couple of years, improving it in various ways, such as <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-2042-class-system-breakout-rework-info-blowout-gameplay-ahead-of-next-weeks-debut/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">returning to the traditional class system</a> beloved by fans. Still, support for Battlefield 2042 <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-2042-support-ending-motive-joining-dev-team-iron-man-still-happening/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">is now winding down</a> as work on the next installment in the IP intensifies.</p>
<p>Interestingly, Dead Space remake developer Motive Studios has joined DICE, Ripple Effect, and Criterion, who are all working on the new Battlefield game. The Dead Space remake launched in early 2023 to very positive reviews; it got 8 out of 10 <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/dead-space-effective-yet-finite-facelift/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in ours</a>:</p>
<p><em>The new Dead Space is a mostly-successful revival of a survival horror landmark, offering atmospheric new visuals and a series of precision updates to combat, level layouts, and the game’s scary bits that ought to surprise and excite veteran engineers.</em></p>
<p>However, fans who were hoping to get the remake treatment for the entire trilogy received some bad news in April when Giant Bomb's Jeff Grubb <a href="https://wccftech.com/dead-space-2-remake-was-never-greenlit-by-ea-franchise-is-now-once-again-on-hold/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">revealed</a> that Electronic Arts never internally greenlit the Dead Space 2 remake. As such, the franchise is once again on hold, and part of Motive is working on Battlefield (another team <a href="https://wccftech.com/iron-man-motive-ue5-early-pre-production/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">is making the Iron Man game</a>).</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/watch-dogs-movie/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>The Watch Dogs movie has officially begun filming, but there’s currently no release date yet.</p>



<p>The announcement came via the Ubisoft X (formerly Twitter) page, where the <a href="https://x.com/Ubisoft/status/1808540050046484836" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">publisher said</a>, “Lights_Camera_Action.exe.” alongside posting an image of a clapperboard from the set.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, not much can be gathered from the image itself, as it appears to be the production team rather than any cast members. However, we know that Tom Blyth and Sophie Wilde are set to star in the movie in some capacity. </p>



<p>Ubisoft’s head of content Margaret Boykin, New Regency CEO Yariv Milchan, and company president of motion pictures Natalie Lehmann are producers of the movie.</p>



<p>The move to start production will undoubtedly start discussions on whether or not a new Watch Dogs game is in the works. Unfortunately, despite the series’ success, we’ve not been able to verify if a new game has been greenlit. The first and second games accumulated 20 million units sold combined.</p>



<p>The last game in the series was Watch Dogs: Legion, which was released in 2020 by Ubisoft Toronto. The game received mixed reviews from critics.</p>



<p>Are you excited about a Watch Dogs movie? And would you like to see another Watch Dogs game? Let us know in the comments below!</p>

            <p>
EA has announced it'll be removing three more older Battlefield games from sale later this month, with their online services shutting down this November.
</p>
<p>
Specifically, the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360 versions of Battlefield 3, Battlefield 4, and Battlefield: Hardline (released in 2011, 2013, and 2015 respectively) will all be delisted from digital storefronts on Wednesday, 31st July. From this point onward, it'll no longer be possible to purchase the games or their corresponding DLC.
</p>
<p>
Additionally, online components for all three titles will no longer be available from 7th November this year. EA <a href="https://x.com/BattlefieldComm/status/1806689437352341764">notes</a>, however, their single-player modes will remain accessible.

<p>
The publisher also stresses today's announcement applies to the PS3 and Xbox 360 versions only. Battlefield 3 will still be available for play on PC, while Battlefield 4 and Battlefield: Hardline will remain available for play on PC, Xbox One, and PlayStation 4. 
</p>
<p>
EA hasn't stated why it's "sunsetting" these particular titles, but an <a href="https://help.ea.com/en-gb/help/faq/list-of-ea-games-that-have-gone-away/">accompanying FAQ</a> says it usually takes these decisions "for legal reasons, or because players are asking for resources elsewhere". It adds, "There comes a time in every game's lifecycle when it makes sense for us to remove it from online stores."
</p>
<p>
Today's news follows EA's decision to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mirrors-edge-battlefield-1943-bad-company-being-pulled-from-sale-in-april">remove Battlefield 1943 and Battlefield: Bad Company 1 &amp; 2 from sale</a> last year - a move it said it was making so it could "shift [its] focus towards our current and future Battlefield experiences."

In your attempt to rise and become the Elden Lord, you naturally come to blows with Gideon, who typically offers advice back at the Roundtable Hold—a gathering place for other Tarnished—even if he is secretly a rat bitch who wants to keep anyone from taking the throne. In short, he has this beating coming. He doesn’t put up a particularly great fight though.</p><p>Even on a first playthrough, Gideon is kind of a chump. His fight is immediately followed by a much more epic and demanding encounter against Godfrey/Horah Loux, making Gideon a sort of <em>aperitif </em>to whet the palette before the series of <em>really </em>demanding boss fights which round out <em>Elden Ring</em>. Gideon is a lanky, gaunt figure, whose appearance only betrays that he’s a nerd who knows a lot of spells to use against you. However, he’s mostly lacking in constitution and, anecdotally, he’s kind of a joke. I guess that’s why <em>Elden Ring </em>players relish flexing on him with their newfound abilities and weapons after wrapping up <em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em>’s exorbitantly more difficult content.</p><p>There’s a few clips making the rounds online, like a particularly brutal one where a player absolutely <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/EldenRingMedia/status/1808112220456226906&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/EldenRingMedia/status/1808112220456226906" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">skewers Gideon with the Greatsword of Damnation</a></span>. They more or less follow the same formula: a player saunters up to Gideon, who launches into his spiel before getting almost instantly obliterated. Some clips are a bit longer than others, but for the most part, veterans returning from the Land of Shadow with new armaments and skills are wiping the floor with him and it is <em>extremely </em>funny.<br></p><p>Folks are having a lot of fun dunking on Gideon with a variety of new weapons. Some are using the elemental perfumes to completely melt the guy in a single hit, while a random TikTok I came across featured a guy using the new hand-to-hand combat to whoop him. Perhaps the funniest of the clips involves a large hammer getting swung around and eventually beamed at the guy’s head, at which point he disintegrates.</p><p>It’s been great seeing players on top after a few weeks of hearing all about <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-shadow-of-erdtree-steam-reviews-difficulty-1851561745&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-shadow-of-erdtree-steam-reviews-difficulty-1851561745">how tough the DLC is</a></span>.

First players developed overpowered builds, but eventually, modders started to decimate Gideon with everything from a gun to <em>Jujutsu Kaisen</em>’s Gojo Satoru.</p><p>In summation: eat shit, Gideon.<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

But <em>The Acolyte</em> doesn’t feel like empty fan-service—except for the horny shit, for once.<br></p><p>The latest episode, titled “Teach / Corrupt,” leans heavily into the raucous and raunchy shipping side of <em>Star Wars</em>, in which the internet daydreams about its ideal space couplings—a culture perfectly encapsulated by the Reylos, who yearn for more Kylo Ren/Rey content. Ever since 2019’s <em>The Rise of Skywalker</em> sealed the romance with a kiss just to kill Kylo almost immediately after, the Reylos have felt both vindicated and robbed.<br></p><p><em>The Acolyte</em> dips back into that well and scoops up a generous helping of sweet, sweet, shipping nectar to serve us, as Qimir (Manny Jacinto) and Osha (Amandla Stenberg) argue up close and in hushed tones and take long, lingering looks at each other. There’s even an entire scene in which Qimir disrobes in front of Osha before stepping into a tide pool and inviting her in. When she threatens to kill him, he asks if he can put his clothes back on first, and when he emerges from the water she takes her sweet time averting her eyes. This is, I believe, the first time someone has been naked in <em>Star Wars</em> media.<br></p><p>Naturally, the internet has gone wild over how unapologetically sexy Qimir is, and is praising the powers-that-be for <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/finally-some-good-fucking-food&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/finally-some-good-fucking-food" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">finally giving them some good fucking food</a></span>. But what’s most notable is that the series’ marketing push is leaning into the horniness—the official <em>Star Wars </em>X (formerly Twitter) account posted a god damn fancam of Manny Jacinto’s lightsaber training. They know what they’re doing, and they’re not ashamed nor afraid of it.<br></p><p><br>For years I’ve seen <em>Star Wars</em> take big steps forward just to be forced backwards when Disney caves to right-wing reactionaries complaining about every Mary Sue, Black character, or queer person that comes within a parsec of their beloved franchise. I’ve seen de-aged Luke Skywalkers pop up where they shouldn’t, Boba Fett get an entire boring-ass series, and every new piece of media circle back on old <em>Star Wars</em> stories like a tedious ouroboros. <em>The Acolyte</em> is something entirely different—it’s taking a chance with a brand-new setting, unfamiliar characters, and an unapologetic (and unapologetically horny) perspective, and while it isn’t perfect, it’s at least exciting. </p><p>And it’s doing all of this while still giving us one of the best lightsaber fights in live-action <em>Star Wars</em>. What more could you want?</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Unless you’re a gatekeeper of the things that bring you joy, you’ve probably tried to get a friend, family member, partner, or stranger on the street to play a game you love in hopes that it will similarly enrich their lives. The sad truth, however, is that it doesn’t always work out. But how can this be? I know how good [insert game here] is! Why are they not immediately jumping on it as I’m telling them it will change their life?<br></p><p>Friends, I’ll tell you this: If I’ve learned anything from talking about video games for decades, it’s that selling people on something you love is a skill not everyone has. You can give the most passionate reasoning as to why someone should play a video game and there’s a non-zero chance that you could actually make them want to play it <em>less</em>. Here are a few tips on the dos and don’ts of selling people on playing the games you love.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="28bd4dc1bf18d8136653b371d534e07d" data-recommend-id="image://28bd4dc1bf18d8136653b371d534e07d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1483" data-height="834" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Joker sits bloody and bruised at a table." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Joker sits bloody and bruised at a table." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Atlus</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="28bd4dc1bf18d8136653b371d534e07d" data-recommend-id="image://28bd4dc1bf18d8136653b371d534e07d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1483" data-height="834" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Joker sits bloody and bruised at a table." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The biggest hurdle you have to overcome in getting people to do something you want them to do is time investment.

So one of the quickest ways to lose the attention of your prospective game player is to tell them that they’re going to have to slog through several fairly dull opening hours to get to the good shit. Unfortunately, this is a trap many games fall into, but you don’t need to start dragging the game from the get-go when delivering your pitch. It’s better to bring attention to the parts of those opening hours that are actually worth seeing, while also giving tips on how they can expedite or avoid some of the less exciting stuff. Think of it like when you give a dog a pill but you cover it in cheese or peanut butter. You can’t lead by undermining your argument.<br></p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="c7765502ffe9afbc552a0f093009f6ce" data-recommend-id="image://c7765502ffe9afbc552a0f093009f6ce" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Sora and Kairi stand in a world made up of mostly sky." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Sora and Kairi stand in a world made up of mostly sky." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Square Enix</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="c7765502ffe9afbc552a0f093009f6ce" data-recommend-id="image://c7765502ffe9afbc552a0f093009f6ce" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Sora and Kairi stand in a world made up of mostly sky." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>So this one’s complicated.

You can’t just tell them, “It’s like <em>Mass Effect</em>,” though. That’s vague, and won’t actually pan out when they boot it up and find it’s not a role-playing shooter. Lean into their favorite things so they have something to latch onto, but be thoughtful and specific about how you make those comparisons.<br></p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="a8e2c88e2935b2ae00ce9a0c75080b16" data-recommend-id="image://a8e2c88e2935b2ae00ce9a0c75080b16" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The Ferryman sits on his boat." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Ferryman sits on his boat." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->GoodbyeWorld Games</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="a8e2c88e2935b2ae00ce9a0c75080b16" data-recommend-id="image://a8e2c88e2935b2ae00ce9a0c75080b16" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The Ferryman sits on his boat." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Do you know how many people I’ve gotten to play GoodbyeWorld Games’ incredible, eye-tracking adventure game <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/before-your-eyes-steam-sale-pc-psvr2-mobile-netflix-1851411401&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/before-your-eyes-steam-sale-pc-psvr2-mobile-netflix-1851411401"><em>Before Your Eyes</em></a></span><em> </em>by telling them it’s just 90 minutes long?

Trying to sell someone on something that will devour their life when they don’t even know if they’re going to like it is like telling someone that if they go on a specific date with this person they’ve never met they are definitively going to get married and settle down. Sure, that sounds like an exciting prospect to you, but lay off the gas for a second. Telling someone they’ve got to add another live-service game to their schedule is asking them to make a big commitment.

Some people want tight mechanics. Others want a story they can immerse themselves in that lets them make big, impactful decisions. Selling someone on the game you like is about recognizing the audience you’re pitching, and the difference between them deciding to play it or not may come down to you knowing how your tastes and priorities differ. If the only way you know how to talk about something is by focusing on how it aligns with your favorite things about video games, you’re not speaking the right language for people who might gravitate toward something else entirely. If, for instance, you’re a graphics sicko but your friend doesn’t give a fuck about how many polygons make up a character’s face, don’t even bring it up. Cater to their tastes above your own.<br></p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="4730fd1b41ed76250e44e0478bd01b57" data-recommend-id="image://4730fd1b41ed76250e44e0478bd01b57" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="An L.A.

But if they’re earnestly asking for something as a hook to get into the game, give them a warning, but don’t gatekeep that information. Mystery is good, but if you’re already operating with someone who needs convincing to play your favorite game, those questions are extending an olive branch that you should accept. Would you rather keep them in the dark and have them not feel the drive to play the game, or give them something to grab their attention so they actually see it through?<br></p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="ec3a2dee6957ae905863114586ed0dca" data-recommend-id="image://ec3a2dee6957ae905863114586ed0dca" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Hajime counters a false statement." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Hajime counters a false statement." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Spike Chunsoft</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="ec3a2dee6957ae905863114586ed0dca" data-recommend-id="image://ec3a2dee6957ae905863114586ed0dca" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Hajime counters a false statement." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>I started playing the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/infinite-wealth-like-a-dragon-review-kasuga-yakuza-1851190269&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/infinite-wealth-like-a-dragon-review-kasuga-yakuza-1851190269"><em>Yakuza </em>series</a></span> in exchange for a friend starting the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/master-detective-archives-switch-review-danganronpa-1850592843&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/master-detective-archives-switch-review-danganronpa-1850592843"><em>Danganronpa</em></a></span><em> </em>games.

Maybe you’re never gonna get that person to hop into your <em>Halo </em>custom game or join your <em>Final Fantasy XIV</em> free company. Stop trying to make fetch happen if it’s not going to happen. Find a different game to play together, or see if there’s another favorite on your list that might jive with them. But don’t harp on it for years on end if you don’t feel like you’re making any progress. That’s just a waste of everyone’s time that could be better spent actually playing something.<br></p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
