            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/open-world-mmorpg-moba-hybrid-corepunk-enters-early-access-on-november-26/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Today, the developer behind Corepunk, Artificial Core, <a href="https://wccftech.com/corepunk-is-an-upcoming-top-down-mmorpg-featuring-pve-pvp-and-fog-of-war/">has announced that Corepunk</a> will be going into Early Access on November 26. This game is shaping up to be an open-world MMORPG crossed over with a MOBA, with a top-down isometric viewpoint to the game. If you think this is something that will interest you, there is a trailer on YouTube that is just under two minutes long to showcase what you can expect from Corepunk. You can watch this video below.</p>
<p><iframe title="Corepunk: Official Early Access Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/N0L8Aj0u9CM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Corepunk comes with a lot of unique features, including expansive character customization, fog-of-war mechanics, and the ability to experience both PvE and PvP in a player-driven world. There are a variety of class options with in-depth skill trees that allow you to stand out from the crowd while you explore the cyber-fantasy world and engage with the storylines set out in front of you.</p>
<p>For those who are curious about the Early Access period of Corepunk, it will feature three full-voiced story episodes, which include a crafting and gathering system. You'll have six character classes to choose from and 15 world bosses to go up against. Of course, this is just the start of the game, and there will be plenty more added in the future. For those who pre-order the game, it will give access <a href="https://corepunk.com/en-us?utm_source=%C3%9CberStrategist%20PR%20List%20-%20Leading%20Gaming%20and%20Tech%20News%20(2023)&amp;utm_campaign=b8576b44ac-EMAIL_CAMPAIGN_2024_11_18_06_59&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=0_-b8576b44ac-256552253" target="_blank" rel="noopener">to the game launcher</a> and Early Access build.</p>
<p>It's also important to note that Corepunk is in active development, with the Early Access period symbolizing the final stage of alpha testing, which is where the developers will be focused on making sure the game is optimized with bug fixing and polishes while also continuing to build on the content that is already released. Corepunk is set for a full launch by the end of 2025.</p>
<p>During the Early Access period of Corepunk, you'll get to explore three biomes, which will take you through the forest, swamps, and steppes, which all have their own unique challenges to face. In total, there are 350 quests that you can participate in during the Early Access period. A lot of these are side quests and are totally optional, allowing you to tweak the playstyle to your liking. As the Early Access period progresses, the developers plan on adding the Extraction Prison Island, PvE instances, and more heroes for players to choose from, allowing for a further unique experience.</p>
<p>Will you be picking up Corepunk in Early Access? Let us know in the comments.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/remedy-says-control-2-will-be-an-action-rpg-alan-wake-2-has-sold-1-8-million-units.1039569/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/remedy-says-control-2-will-be-an-action-rpg-alan-wake-2-has-sold-1-8-million-units/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>During today's Capital Markets Day dedicated to investors, Finnish developer Remedy Entertainment has revealed new information on Control 2 and Alan Wake 2. As for the latter, we learned that it has sold 1.8 million units to date, which, however, isn't enough to fully <a href="https://wccftech.com/alan-wake-2-still-hasnt-recouped-all-its-development-and-marketing-costs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recoup</a> all the development and marketing costs yet.</p>
<p>Control 2 is aiming far higher, with Remedy telling investors that sales of 3-4 million units would be required to fully recuperate a budget of €50 million (up from the €30 million spent on the first one) and go into profits. Part of the reason is that the sequel is being turned into an action RPG, whereas the original <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/control-full-on-paranatural-remedy-metroidvania-action/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">was</a> an action adventure. Action RPG is a more marketable genre with a bigger audience. The first Control has sold 4.5 million units to date, while 19 million players have accessed the game in total (including, for example, Game Pass and PlayStation Plus subscriptions).</p>
<p>Control 2 was originally <a href="https://wccftech.com/control-2-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> two years ago for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X. Back then, it looked like Remedy would repeat the successful partnership with 505 Games that gave birth to the previous installment. However, they completely <a href="https://wccftech.com/control-ip-acquired-by-remedy-for-e17-million/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">changed</a> the plan earlier this year by acquiring the IP from 505 Games for €17 million. Two months ago, we <a href="https://wccftech.com/remedy-partners-with-annapurna-interactive-for-control-2-films-and-tv-shows-also-planned/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">learned</a> that Remedy had chosen a new partner, Annapurna Interactive; they would co-finance the game's development while leaving the IP in the hands of the Finnish studio and also work on live action adaptations for both Control and Alan Wake.</p>
<p>Before Control 2, Remedy will launch its cooperative multiplayer spin-off FBC <a href="https://wccftech.com/fbc-firebreak-multiplayer-game-set-in-the-control-world-revealed-with-new-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">FBC Firebreak</a>, which is being made on a €30 million budget, won't cost full price, and will require three million units sold to be successful.</p>
<p>As a reminder, in addition to the multiple projects related to the so-called Remedy Connected Universe, the studio is also remaking its first two games, Max Payne 1 and 2, for Rockstar Games. Last we <a href="https://wccftech.com/max-payne-1-and-2-remake-full-production/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">heard</a>, the remake project entered full production three months ago.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/super-monkey-ball-banana-rumble-godzilla-hatsune-miku</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/super-monkey-ball-banana-rumble-gets-godzilla-and-hatsune-miku-dlc-next-week.1039566/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/super-monkey-ball-banana-rumble-godzilla-hatsune-miku<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sega has revealed two new DLC characters for chaotic party platformer&nbsp;<em>Super Monkey Ball Banana Rumble</em>, and you couldn't hope to find two more contrasting pop culture icons.</p>

<p>Both characters are being added on November 26th, and they'll join the likes of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/super-monkey-ball-banana-rumble-sonic-dlc" rel="nofollow">the&nbsp;<em>Sonic the Hedgehog&nbsp;</em>crew</a>,&nbsp;<em>Crazy Taxi</em>'s Axel, and&nbsp;<em>Jet Set Radio</em>'s Beat&nbsp;as downloadable, er, "monkeys" for the game.</p>

<p>First up, nuclear monster Godzilla is joining the&nbsp;<em>Super Monkey Ball Banana Rumble&nbsp;</em>roster. Of course, this is a cutesy chibi-fied version of Godzilla rather than the fully-sized creature you might see in the likes of&nbsp;<em>Godzilla Minus One</em>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/godzilla-super-monkey-ball-banana-rumble.jpg?itok=S8Ei2Gqe 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/godzilla-super-monkey-ball-banana-rumble.jpg?itok=4_YKO6l- 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Yep, that really is Godzilla himself in&nbsp;<em>Super Monkey Ball Banana Rumble</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>This is far from Godzilla's first video game appearance, and it's not even his first foray into the realms of DLC or update crossovers; he's also appeared in games like&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dave-diver-godzilla-dlc-coming-next-week" rel="nofollow">Dave the Diver</a>&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/king-kong-and-godzilla-will-take-up-fight-in-world-of-warships" rel="nofollow"><em>World of Warships</em></a>, battling his old archnemesis King Kong in the latter.</p>

<p>Your second new DLC character for&nbsp;<em>Super Monkey Ball Banana Rumble&nbsp;</em>is none other than Vocaloid star Hatsune Miku, who seems a little better-suited to the adorable world of&nbsp;<em>Monkey Ball</em>.</p>

<p>Much like Godzilla, Miku has also made appearances in other properties alongside starring in her own games; memorably, she was part of a <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/mtg-secret-lair-summer-superdrop-2024-brings-assassins-creed-and-hatsune-miku" rel="nofollow">major&nbsp;<em>Magic: The Gathering&nbsp;</em>collaboration</a> earlier this year.</p>

<p>First, here's the trailer for Godzilla, which shows off what he'll look like in&nbsp;<em>Super Monkey Ball Banana Rumble</em>.</p>




<p>Now that you've had your fill of kaiju antics, you can check out the altogether more anime-style trailer for Hatsune Miku.</p>




<p>Both of these characters will arrive alongside&nbsp;<em>Super Monkey Ball Banana Rumble</em>'s 2.0 update, which brungs a number of new adventure challenges, battle stages, and modes. It's all launching on November 26th.</p>

<p><em>Super Monkey Ball Banana Rumble&nbsp;</em>is available right now, <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/super-monkey-ball-banana-rumble-switch/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">exclusively for Nintendo Switch</a>. Stay tuned for more on this.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/binding-of-isaac-repentance-plus-update-co-op<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nicalis has released the long-awaited&nbsp;<em>The Binding of Isaac&nbsp;</em>Repentance+ update, finally bringing online co-op to the dungeon-crawling roguelike, as well as a host of other new stuff.</p>

<p>As noted in a Steam post announcing the update's launch, you're going to need all of the game's previous DLC in order to enjoy this update, and you're also going to need to be playing&nbsp;<em>The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth&nbsp;</em>rather than the original base game.</p>

<p>Assuming you tick all of those boxes, the Repentance+ update brings four-player online co-op to&nbsp;<em>The Binding of Isaac</em>, and it works across the game's Normal, Hard, Greed, Greedier, and Challenge modes, as well as daily runs and seeded runs.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-binding-of-isaac-repentance-update-online-co-op.jpg?itok=3uTgmAGx 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-binding-of-isaac-repentance-update-online-co-op.jpg?itok=dfBgGw8J 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>The Binding of Isaac&nbsp;</em>now supports four-player co-op, assuming you're playing&nbsp;<em>Rebirth</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>There are a few differences to watch out for in online play. Bosses will drop items for all players, and if you join a run in progress, you'll be given items to catch you up "based on how far along the run is".</p>

<p>You can also spend coins at a revive machine to bring back dead players, but the cost will increase every time you do so, so make sure you consider carefully whether or not it's worth bringing back your friends.</p>

<p>Mods will be disabled online, and you also won't be able to unlock achievements in online play if you join mid-run (although joining at the very start of a run will be fine).</p>

<p>Pay no mind to the "beta" tag attached to this update; Nicalis says it's a "full-featured release", but that the beta tag has been attached because the studio is "still looking to refine things and squash any remaining bugs".</p>




<p>As well as online co-op, this update also brings a veritable treasure trove of item buffs and reworks for solo players, as well as a number of fixes that should make your&nbsp;<em>Binding of Isaac&nbsp;</em>experience a bit smoother. You can read <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/250900/view/7119722540407193807" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">the full patch notes here</a> if you want to.</p>

<p>The Repentance+ update is available right now, but you'll need all of the game's previous DLC to run it. That includes&nbsp;<em>Rebirth</em>, as well as its&nbsp;<em>Afterbirth&nbsp;</em>DLC and the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/binding-of-isaac-rebirth-repentance-update-is-its-biggest-yet" rel="nofollow">original Repentance update</a>.</p>

<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/microsoft-flight-simulator-2024">Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024</a> launches on Steam and the Microsoft Store today. Developed once again by Asobo - otherwise celebrated for their <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/a-plague-tale-requiem">stinking rat hordes</a> - it builds upon <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/microsoft-flight-simulator-2020">the 2020 game</a> by "[taking] advantage of the latest technologies in simulation, cloud, machine learning, graphics and gaming", in the words of the launch announcement release</p>
<p>We've got a review in the works, but code has landed late, so our write-up might take a while. In the shorter term, I thought you might like to know how, exactly, MFS 2024 makes use of "machine learning" technologies, taking into account the energy cost of such wacky gadgetry and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-and-zenimax-union-reach-first-of-its-kind-agreement-over-usage-of-ai-tools-in-gamedev">the creeping relationship between increased reliance on automated tools and laying people off</a>. More immediately, you might like to know how much of your internet package it'll devour as you play.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 shares many of its moving parts with the 2020 game, which made use of tech from Blackshark.ai, Microsoft's Azure tools and Bing Maps to analyse satellite and aerial imagery and generate <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/all-341-photorealistic-cities-in-microsoft-flight-simulator-2020">terrain maps and objects such as buildings</a>. While a lot of this is delivered by the initial download, some of it is streamed to you on demand. 
</p>
<p>
The major change with MFS 2024 is that it streams a lot more, while simultaneously trying to offer a lot more visual opulence. "We did surveys and asked people, how can we do this - what can we improve?" MFS head Jorg Neumann told me in an interview earlier this month. "And one of the areas that was very consistent was well, it would be nice if the ground would look a little bit better. Because in MFS 2020 we had the whole world and it looked good from a certain altitude, but once you landed, it didn't look super-detailed."

</p>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jwI5VZo-wNc" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figure>
<p>
MFS 2024 tries to address this by way of a new online machine learning platform that generates terrain detail on demand, based on rules given by the developers. "So we looked at the textures, basically, and the way it works is we had a team that marked up 28,000 tiles," Neumann explained. "So we picked some tiles that were representative of Earth - some of them were forest, some of them were desert, some of them were rivers, those types of things, and then we mark them up and say, 'this is gravel, this is low grass, this is bush'. 
</p><p>
"And then you feed that into a machine learning system, and you say 'this type of colour and this type of pattern is this' - you feed it in, and you get everything back, you look at the results, and then you have human intervention again. You basically say: 'Oh OK, got this wrong.' And then you retrain it. We did that in four different stages."</p>
<p>What does that process of human intervention look like in practice, I asked? What's the trick to avoiding the kind of uncanny distortion we often see in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/to-understand-the-future-of-generative-ai-we-need-better-language-to-describe-it">today's prompt-based generated art</a>, to say nothing of the previous game's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/a-perfectly-normal-abyss-has-appeared-in-microsoft-flight-sim">cosmically horrible terrain deformations</a>?
</p>
<p>
"It's just picture analysis, really," Neumann said. "It's just a lookup table and you say, is this sand? We defined, I think, 26 different surface types - red sand or brown sand to asphalts, those types of things. And I don't know about distortion but you know, you basically say, 'oh this one is this, and this one is this', and it got some stuff wrong sometimes, you know - it understood gravel to be sand. And then you have to retrain it a little bit." 
</p>
<p>
Once generated in response to one player's movements, MFS 2024's terrain data is then available to other pilots - it's streamed into their games when they're close by. This makes the system more efficient, and gives rise to the peculiar thought that when you fly over a remote area in the game you are bringing that location to life for everybody else.
</p><p>
One inevitable fear I had, on hearing about this system, is whether the expanded role of machine learning has come at the cost of jobs. While it varies by the tool, discipline and company, there's a link between today's AI tools and corporate cost-cutting, with larger video game publishers such as Microsoft <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-have-aligned-on-the-best-opportunities-for-growth-by-firing-nearly-two-thousand-people">dismissing tens of thousands of people</a> even as they <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/after-huge-layoffs-last-week-microsoft-are-now-chucking-billions-of-dollars-into-openai">spend billions</a> on software that theoretically automates aspects of game development, such as the creation of art assets for buildings and vehicles.
</p>
<p>
According to Neumann, however, MFS 2024's expanded usage of machine learning has had "no impact" on the workforce. "The only thing we've done is grow," he went on. "Flight Simulator 2020, it was a team of 100. Flight Simulator 2024 is 200 people at Asobo, a total of 800 people [at supporting studios]." It would not have been possible to mark up the game's map for the generator 'by hand', Neumann insisted. "We would have spent our entire lives and then some just marking up terrain, which is not really the core of the thing. So it's just a tool that helps us."
</p>
<p>
The more immediate concern is that the reliance on streaming will require the beefiest of broadband connections. A few months ago, there was a <a href="https://www.tweaktown.com/news/101112/microsoft-flight-simulator-2024-uses-up-to-81gb-of-downloads-per-hour-play-the-game/index.html">report</a> that MFS 2024 would require you to stream as much as 81GB an hour. Neumann told me that this was a calculation based on an unoptimised build running on the most demanding settings, and that the average data use would be "way, way less than that" - not least because most players will spend the bulk of their time high up, coasting through already-loaded "aerial data" that doesn't have to be streamed. Asked to give a rough average figure for a player's data use, he suggested a relatively modest 5GB an hour.
</p>
<p>
While 5GB an hour is still quite a chunk, Neumann feels the expanded streaming system is more efficient from the player's perspective, because it means the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-flight-simulators-latest-patch-halves-the-games-download-size">initial download</a> can be a lot smaller - around 50GB. It also means you won't have to download massive expansions over the next few years - instead, the game's representation of Earth can be overhauled and expanded remotely, with the new bits being streamed to each player as required. 
</p><p>
"Flight Simulator 2020 was around 120 gig, and then we added all these world updates, and each world update hovers between 10 gigs and 30 gigs, so we're now at hundreds of gigs," he said. "And we're going to keep going. So just imagine world update 38 in 2028, or something. A terabyte download - it just doesn't scale."
</p>
<p>
In practice, Nuemann noted, many MFS 2020 players didn't feel inclined to visit the vast majority of its simulated Earth. "An airport is two gigabytes, and we have a ton of airports, right," he said. "Under the old scheme, you had to download every airport, even though you had no intention of ever visiting this place. I know a lot of people that just fly from their local hometown to where they grew up in college. And they don't want to explore the entire planet. They just want to hang out in the area that they know.

"Their data consumption [in MFS 2024] is going to be tiny. So we actually think we've saved a bunch, and that's actually much better. The brute force huge client thing - I don't think this really scales. Just imagine if our texture resolution goes up again."
</p>
<p>
While Neumann's arguments about efficiency sound reasonable to me in the abstract, it's obviously unclear right now how players will play Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024, and how they might use or abuse its dependence on streaming generated terrain. One, more whimsical scenario that occurs to me is that disreputable pilots might decide to troll the developers by carrying out low-altitude flights en masse, increasing the burdens on the machine learning and streaming systems. 
</p><p>
That open-endedness is worrisome because generative AI at large has a mounting energy and emissions cost, and Microsoft especially are trying to walk the line between adhering to <a href="https://blogs.microsoft.com/blog/2020/01/16/microsoft-will-be-carbon-negative-by-2030/">relatively ambitious carbon negative plans</a> while also plunging inordinate sums into technologies such as OpenAI's various roided-up chatbots and Microsoft's flagship Copilot app.</p>
<p>The most prominent generative AI tools soak up <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.02243">a lot of power</a>, both in the course of "training" them on datasets with human oversight, and when actually running them on data centres. For all their rhetoric, Microsoft's greenhouse gas emissions were actually <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/15/24157496/microsoft-ai-carbon-footprint-greenhouse-gas-emissions-grow-climate-pledge">30 per cent higher in fiscal year 2023</a> than the previous year.
</p>
<p>
While Neumann didn't share any estimates about overall energy usage in our chat, I doubt that Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024's new machine learning and streaming systems will have an emissions footprint on par with, say, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-are-adding-a-dedicated-ai-button-to-windows-keyboards-as-they-call-2024-the-year-of-the-ai-pc">giving your keyboard a Copilot button</a>. But it's all part of the picture. Look out for more on the subject in a piece later this month, in which Neumann and I discuss the philosophy of flight simulation, future community-driven features, and the sheer weirdness of generating an entire planet in real time.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>A fan-made <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-walkthrough-8042">Elden Ring</a> anime has been delayed into next year, but a new teaser trailer shows how production is developing.</p>
<p>The anime adaptation was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fan-made-elden-ring-anime-adaptation-receives-teaser-trailer">revealed in July this year</a>, with the full five-minute short film aiming for an autumn release.</p>
<p>That's now been pushed back to summer 2025, to give creator Steins Alter more time to polish the animation.</p>

<p>The new teaser trailer, above, reveals both the new Japanese, French, and Brazilian dubs, and some work-in-progress comparison shots.</p>
<p>Steins Alter stated in the video the release delay was "sort of a hard decision for me to stomach".</p>
<p>"However, us animators are all very busy, and rushing on isn't within any of my interests," the creator continued. "I want to spend all these extra months polishing the animations and style, getting the most out of the animations by these talented animators."</p>
<p>It's certainly looking impressive and I look forward to seeing more of Malenia next year.</p>
<p>Despite the anime arriving three years after Elden Ring's release, it's still somewhat timely. <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-tips-and-tricks">Shadow of the Erdtree</a>, the game's DLC expansion, was released earlier this year and has received a nomination for Best Game at <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/astro-bot-final-fantasy-7-rebirth-lead-this-years-the-game-award-nominations">this year's The Game Awards</a>.</p>
<p>Earlier today, Reuters reported <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-in-talks-to-buy-elden-ring-dark-souls-developer-fromsoftware">Sony is in talks to buy FromSoftware parent company Kadokawa</a>, meaning it would own the rights to Elden Ring and Dark Souls alongside Bloodborne and Demon's Souls.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/rainbow-six-siege-to-get-pc-and-console-cross-play-next-month/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>A game that has been out since 2015 and has been released on many different platforms is only now seeing a cross-play option implemented next month. If you've been eagerly awaiting the day for Rainbow Six Siege to get PC and Console cross-play, you won't have to wait much longer. Support for cross-play on all platforms will launch in December with the latest update to be added, Rainbow Six Siege's Year 9 Season 4 update named Operation Collision Point. With this update, it means that players can now team up with their friends regardless of what platform they're playing on. However, if there is a PC player in the group, the team will always be put into the PC matchmaking pool.</p>
<p>While this is the first time Rainbow Six Siege is getting cross-play on all platforms, it isn't the first time the game had any sort of cross-play, as there was cross-play and cross-progression enabled for PC, Amazon Luna, and the Google Stadia version of the game in June 2021. However, Google Stadia fizzled out very quickly, and this brings us to the current day, where only PC and Amazon Luna had cross-play, or Xbox and PlayStation, which was added in late 2022.</p>
<p>While it has taken a <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-to-february-2025-ubisoft-announces-return-to-steam-on-day-1-and-departs-season-pass-model/">relatively long time</a>, this is something they've been actively working towards throughout the years that Rainbow Six Siege has been live. When cross-play for Xbox and PlayStation was released in late 2022, Ubisoft also added cross-progression across all platforms. Adding cross-play between PC and console is the final hurdle, so to speak. It has taken a relatively long time for them to get to this point, but it's because they've also been working to ensure that players are protected and cheaters are accurately punished if detected.</p>
<p>"Player Protection advances this season include Mousetrap Penalty adjustments to account for crossplay, automatic match cancellation if a cheater is detected, an overhaul for the Reputation center, and AI text moderation," says Chris Watters at Ubisoft. All of the information regarding<a href="https://news.ubisoft.com/en-us/article/4luBBDMfipI6BDrwGGMV0L/rainbow-six-siege-operation-collision-point-operator-remaster-and-balancing-guide" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Operation Collision Point</a> is available to read on the Ubisoft news page, which breaks down how they have balanced some of the Operators, as well as general improvements that are suited to the cross-platform experience.</p>
<p>To celebrate the news of the upcoming update, Ubisoft has released a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vUoHI1dehzI" target="_blank" rel="noopener">four-minute video</a> that provides information on how to utilize Blackbeard, as well as some starter tips for those who may be getting stuck into the game for the first time.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/farming-simulator-25-sales-2-million-one-week<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Giants Software has revealed that&nbsp;<em>Farming Simulator 25&nbsp;</em>hit a very impressive sales milestone within its first week on release, demonstrating (if demonstration were truly needed) the staying power of the long-running franchise.</p>

<p>Per a press release,&nbsp;<em>Farming Simulator 25&nbsp;</em>managed to sell two million copies <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/farming-simulator-25-announced-november" rel="nofollow">inside a week</a>. Not only that, but the game's concurrent Steam <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2300320/charts/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">player count record</a> is at 135,970 at time of writing, with a 24-hour peak of 114,176.</p>

<p>By contrast,&nbsp;<em>Farming Simulator 22</em>, the previous mainline entry in the series, has an <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1248130/charts/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">all-time player count record of 105,636</a> on Steam, so it looks like the new game has comfortably beaten its predecessor, which will likely come as a relief to Giants.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/farming-simulator-25-sales-vehicle.jpg?itok=MXShq8QN 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/farming-simulator-25-sales-vehicle.jpg?itok=q54NeWR6 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Farming Simulator 25&nbsp;</em>has managed an impressive sales performance in its first week.</figcaption></figure><p>What's more, according to the aforementioned press release,&nbsp;<em>Farming Simulator 25&nbsp;</em>has broken&nbsp;<em>Farming Simulator 22</em>'s sales record of 1.5 million copies in its first week, so the new kid on the block really has triumphed over the old hand.</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Farming Simulator 25</em>, well, I'm sure you can work out what we're dealing with here, but just in case, it's...well...a farming simulator.</p>

<p>Created by Giants Software, a studio that's pretty much known for this franchise and not a whole lot else,&nbsp;<em>Farming Simulator 25&nbsp;</em>introduces East Asian landscapes to the series, allowing you to farm rice paddies, sell your goods to neon-drenched port cities, and more.</p>

<p>You can also look forward to new weather patterns like hail and twisters, forcing you to change up your farming strategy in response to extreme weather (a challenge that I'm sure real-life farmers are also having to grapple with more and more these days).</p>




<p>You can pick up&nbsp;<em>Farming Simulator 25&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2300320/Farming_Simulator_25/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/farming-simulator-25/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/farming-simulator-25/9nmcdq6rcjkh" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>.

Well, one major detail: <em>Control 2</em> will be an action RPG, seemingly deviating from the action-adventure template set by the original.</p><p>The news came during <a href="https://investors.remedygames.com/capital-markets-day-2024/">an investors presentation</a>, in which the studio revealed <a href="https://x.com/remedygames/status/1858851495493403094">a few other tidbits</a> about its franchises: <em>Alan Wake 2</em> has sold over 1.8 million copies, the “ultimate edition” of <em>Control </em>hits Mac on February 12th, and it will also be getting a free update of some kind next year that will unlock “previously released content.”</p><p>A large part of the presentation was devoted to Remedy’s ambitious plan to build out an interconnected universe, which will span not only game franchises like <em>Control</em> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24279410/alan-wake-2-the-lake-house-expansion-review"><em>Alan Wake</em></a>, but also film and TV. Earlier this year <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/29/24231469/control-sequel-movie-tv-remedy-annapurna">the studio announced a partnership with Annapurna</a> to explore bringing its franchises to new mediums, and today creative director Sam Lake said that the process is still in its “very early steps.” Last month <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/17/24272812/fbc-firebreak-is-its-own-fully-formed-thing">Remedy also revealed <em>FBC: Firebreak</em></a>, its first multiplayer game, which is tied to its other games.</p><p>“<em>Alan Wake</em>, <em>Control</em>, and <em>Firebreak</em> are all set in the Remedy connected universe,” Lake explained during the presentation. “Now, there are many fictional universes out there of course.

<p>Reliable industry insider Jez Corden has revealed details about Fable’s alpha gameplay footage, indicating that the game’s style is similar to CD Projekt Red’s.</p>



<p>In the latest episode of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VmNZUoJnqdg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The Xbox Two</a> podcast (as shared by <a href="https://x.com/ZakkenKloot/status/1858632263761883513" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">ZakkenKloot</a> on X), Jez Corden discussed seeing some alpha gameplay footage for Fable and expressed his excitement by describing it as “fantastic.” However, Corden is uncertain about the timeline for this alpha build.</p>



<p>Corden discusses how the alpha gameplay footage of Fable contains elements reminiscent of “CD Projekt Red DNA.” He explains that Playground Games has hired several developers from CD Projekt Red, including a combat designer.</p>



<p>From the combat footage, he can identify where the inspiration originates. While the gameplay isn’t an exact replica of The Witcher, it features similar mechanics. Furthermore, the footage looks “super polished” for an alpha build.</p>



<p>Moreover, Corden revealed that Fable’s alpha gameplay footage showcased various weapon types, including bows and arrows, spells, and melee weapons—similar to those used by Geralt. He also discusses the design of certain enemy types, featuring comedic and frightening elements for chickens and werewolves. Overall, he felt that the gameplay looked impressive, and the combat was “very tight” for an alpha build.</p>



<p>In other news, Alan Wake 2 has sold <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/alan-wake-2-units-sold/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">over 1.8 million copies</a>. Also, Pokemon TCG Pocket reportedly <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-has-surpassed-120-million-in-earnings-report-claims/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">surpassed $120 million in earnings</a>.

            <p>Remedy's upcoming Control sequel - aptly titled <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/control-2">Control 2</a> - will be an action-RPG.</p>
<p>The developer first announced a sequel to its surreal action-adventure back in 2022, simply stating <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/remedy-officially-announces-sequel-to-control">Control 2 would be an "unexpected journey"</a>. In the time since, the developer has kept most details close to its chest, although in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/max-payne-1-2-remake-enters-full-production-control-2-features-in-playable-form">August of this year it stated "important" Control 2 features are now in "playable form"</a>.</p>

<p>We now have another small morsel of information on the sequel, however, thanks to confirmation from Remedy that the upcoming release will be an action-RPG. The developer shared this little nugget of information during its <a href="https://investors.remedygames.com/capital-markets-day-2024/">Capital Markets day presentation</a>, before following it up with a rather casual bullet point tucked within a social media post.</p>
<p>This same post also said Control Ultimate Edition will release on Mac on 12th February, and Control will receive a free update early next year, which will unlock "some previously released content".</p>
<p>Meanwhile, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/alan-wake-2">Alan Wake 2</a> has now sold over 1.8m units. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/alan-wake-2-has-now-recouped-most-of-the-money-it-cost-to-make">Earlier this month</a>, Remedy said the sequel was close to recouping the money the studio had spent on developing and marketing the game, 12 months after its initial release.</p>

<p>As for Control 2, while we still admittedly do not know much about the sequel, fans do believe <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/control-2-tease-lies-in-alan-wake-2s-lake-house-dlc-fans-say">Remedy has hidden a little teaser for the forthcoming game in its Alan Wake 2 DLC</a>, The Lake House.</p>
<p>But, while we wait a little longer to see where this tease ultimately leads, Remedy also has its Control spin-off - FBC: Firebreak - in the pipeline. The three-player co-op multiplayer will launch for PC and consoles in 2025, and is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/alan-wake-control-developer-remedy-reveals-first-ever-multiplayer-game">coming to Xbox Game Pass on day one</a>. You can check out a trailer for FBC: Firebreak in the video above. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/alan-wake-2-sales-hit-1-8m-new-control-2-direction-revealed.1039449/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/alan-wake-2-sales-control-2-action-rpg<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Remedy has revealed that&nbsp;<em>Alan Wake 2&nbsp;</em>sales have almost hit the two million mark since its release last year, and the studio has also unveiled some more info about an interesting new direction in which&nbsp;<em>Control 2&nbsp;</em>is headed.</p>

<p>Speaking to investors <a href="https://x.com/remedygames/status/1858851495493403094" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">on its recent Capital Markets day</a>, Remedy revealed that&nbsp;<em>Alan Wake 2</em>, which was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/alan-wake-2-has-been-slightly-delayed" rel="nofollow">released in October last year</a>, has reached "over" 1.8 million sales, although the company doesn't give an exact figure. By contrast,&nbsp;<em>Alan Wake: Remastered&nbsp;</em>apparently sold around 1.7 million copies.</p>

<p>Last we heard,&nbsp;<em>Alan Wake 2&nbsp;</em>had <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/remedy-q3-financials-alan-wake-2" rel="nofollow">almost recouped its development and marketing costs</a>. Presumably, this is still the case, as if the game had done so since that announcement, it's likely Remedy would have told its investors.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/alan-wake-2-sales-control-2-rpg-saga.jpg?itok=wvtB6L7N 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/alan-wake-2-sales-control-2-rpg-saga.jpg?itok=dSndfuWZ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Alan Wake 2&nbsp;</em>has hit 1.8 million sales since its release last year, Remedy has revealed.</figcaption></figure><p>Given that&nbsp;<em>Alan Wake 2&nbsp;</em>had sold 1.3 million copies <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/alan-wake-2-sales" rel="nofollow">back in February</a>&nbsp;(apparently making it the fastest-selling Remedy game thus far), that means a further half a million copies have been sold since that point, which isn't too bad for a game that is, in the end, fairly niche.</p>

<p>Remedy also had some info to share about the upcoming&nbsp;<em>Control 2</em>&nbsp;on its Capital Markets day. The game, which will be <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/remedy-annapurna-control-2-tv-movies" rel="nofollow">produced in conjunction with Annapurna</a>, will apparently be "an action RPG".</p>

<p>It's worth saying that the phrase "action RPG" is a fairly broad one; this could mean pretty much anything from a light leveling system all the way through to a full looter-shooter framework, so we'll have to wait and see exactly what Remedy means by that.</p>

<p>However, it does represent a shift in direction from the original&nbsp;<em>Control</em>, which is perhaps best described as an action-adventure game tinged with Metroidvania elements.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/control-2-action-rpg-original-control.jpg?itok=ssxjKL7A 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/control-2-action-rpg-original-control.jpg?itok=pTFbYKoa 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Control 2&nbsp;</em>will head in a more RPG-ward direction than its predecessor.</figcaption></figure><p>What's more, a free update for the original&nbsp;<em>Control&nbsp;</em>is coming in early 2025, and it will unlock "some previously released content", although Remedy doesn't specify exactly what that content might be. Better watch out for that one, I suppose.</p>

<p>As a reminder, we still don't have a release date for&nbsp;<em>Control 2</em>, nor do we know exactly when the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fbc-firebreak-control-spinoff-announced" rel="nofollow">recently-announced multiplayer spinoff&nbsp;</a><em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fbc-firebreak-control-spinoff-announced" rel="nofollow">FBC: Firebreak</a>&nbsp;</em>will be arriving.</p>

<p>Remedy did, however, reveal the kind of budget&nbsp;<em>Control 2</em>&nbsp;has, suggesting that as a triple-A action RPG, it has a budget somewhere in the realm of&nbsp;€50 million.&nbsp;<em>FBC: Firebreak</em>, meanwhile, as a "mid-price" multiplayer title, has a more modest&nbsp;€30m budget.</p>

<p>According to Remedy,&nbsp;<em>Control 2&nbsp;</em>would need to sell around three to four million copies across its lifetime to guarantee a 100% return on investment, while&nbsp;<em>FBC: Firebreak&nbsp;</em>would need to rack up about three million. Whether or not that's realistic, we'll have to wait and see.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/minecraft-attractions-merlin-entertainments</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/real-life-minecraft-immersive-attractions-announced-by-legoland-company.1039446/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/minecraft-attractions-merlin-entertainments<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Legoland parent company Merlin Entertainments has announced a series of real-life immersive&nbsp;<em>Minecraft&nbsp;</em>attractions, with the first set to debut in the UK and US sometime between 2026 and 2027.</p>

<p>Per <a href="https://www.merlinentertainments.biz/newsroom/news-releases/2024/merlin-minecraft-in-real-life/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">an official announcement</a> on the Merlin Entertainments website, the attractions will involve "<em>Minecraft</em>-themed guest accommodation, retail, and food &amp; beverage", as well as "a&nbsp;<em>Minecraft</em>-themed ride" at existing Merlin locations in both countries.</p>

<p>In the long term, Merlin says it intends to extend these experiences to other countries as well, but they'll just be in Merlin locations in the US and UK to start with.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/minecraft-attractions-merlin-entertainments-village.jpg?itok=1S9kkGKx 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/minecraft-attractions-merlin-entertainments-village.jpg?itok=0xX1eR7J 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>You could be visiting this&nbsp;<em>Minecraft&nbsp;</em>attraction (or something like this mockup, anyway) sometime in the future.</figcaption></figure><p>As well as the experiences themselves, Merlin says it'll be introducing "touchpoints" that you can use to augment your&nbsp;<em>Minecraft&nbsp;</em>experience and add "exclusive in-game content".</p>

<p>The rides and experiences will be costing Merlin somewhere in the region of $110 million to start with, and that number will obviously climb as more rides and&nbsp;<em>Minecraft&nbsp;</em>attractions are introduced around the world.</p>

<p>We're a long way away from the&nbsp;<em>Minecraft&nbsp;</em>theme park map that was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/minecraft-theme-park-map-released-as-part-of-10-year-anniversary-celebration" rel="nofollow">created as part of the game's 10th anniversary celebrations</a> back in 2019; these are proper, physical&nbsp;<em>Minecraft&nbsp;</em>experiences you'll be able to enjoy at actual brick-and-mortar Merlin locations.</p>

<p>Naturally, Merlin hasn't announced exactly what the attractions will be yet, nor when they'll actually be arriving. It's likely we'll be waiting a little while for that info, since the rollout is at least a year and a half or so away.</p>




<p>It's quite possible the&nbsp;<em>Minecraft&nbsp;</em>experiences will find their home in Merlin's Legoland; after all, you can't say that doesn't make a lot of sense.</p>

<p>However, Merlin also owns the likes of Alton Towers, Thorpe Park, and Chessington, all of which are very popular UK theme park destinations, so the rides could be appearing in those locations, too.</p>

<p>Given that Legoland has US locations in New York and California, though, my money's on there for the inaugural&nbsp;<em>Minecraft&nbsp;</em>attraction rollout. Stay tuned for more on this one.</p>

            <p>A long while ago I wrote about <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/vampire-survivors">Vampire Survivors</a>-likes needing to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/vampire-survivors-likes-need-to-cut-through-the-clutter">stop overwhelming you with visual clutter</a>. I've since played a few games of a similar ilk that don't hammer you with a chaos that's impossible to dissect with your eyeballs. One of these is <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/bloodshed">Bloodshed</a>, an old school <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">FPS</a> take on the VS formula that actually works pretty well and did have me thinking the treacherous phrase "just one more run".</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Bloodshed's not actually out just yet, but there's a demo for it over on Steam, and it's sort of Vampire Survivors meets Doom. You pick between a lad with a pistol or a lad with a sawed-off shotgun and you're to head into a grim little town with a raging bonfire at its heart. The aim? Survive for 20 minutes against an ever-expanding horde of occultists and demons (at least, that's the one mission available in the demo).</p>
<p>It's Vampire Survivors in the sense you auto-shoot or (if you're holding a melee weapon) stab whenever you hover your cursor over an enemy, though you can manually shoot and stab, too, if you'd like. And as you slaughter the horde, they drop EXP orbs that level you up. Ding upwards and you'll get to pick from a randomly generated assortment of upgrades, all VS-coded fare: lightning bolts that rain from the sky, eldritch traps, spooky homing-missile skulls, better ammo capacity.</p>
<figure>
<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/bloodshed-demo.jpg?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">
 </a>
<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Headup</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>It's Doom, meanwhile, in the way it looks and feels. You've got that nippy cornering and the low hop that's frightfully fast. The shooting is punchy, with enemies bursting into green gunge or red goblets that splatter all over the floor.</p><p>Both the VS and the Doom influences combine pretty well, making for quite the hurried dash around a map that quickly becomes a ripe field of blood and orbs. I liked the fact that losing or finishing a run meant you could spend the cash you accrued on permanent upgrades, or you'd just unlock new in-game upgrades like the bazooka. I'd say, though, that the pace of a run might feel a bit slow at the moment, taking a while to really ramp up. And it's a shame that the upgrades don't appear to combine with one another. So far, they all seemingly exist as separate entities. So no pairing the sawed-off with the lightning for some bolt-slinging shotgun.</p>
<p>Still, it might be worth giving the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2747550/Bloodshed/">Bloodshed demo</a> a go if you're after something Survivory that isn't the usual top-down fare.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/inaugural-indie-game-awards-announce-full-list-of-nominees/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>The Indie Game Awards have announced the full list of award categories and nominees for its inaugural show on December 19.</p>



<p>In total, there are 15 awards up for grabs at the event with 63 games vying for awards in music, gameplay design, innovation, narrative, and more. Two awards, Storyteller and Industry Impact, didn’t have a list of nominees announced. Instead, those two awards will be announced specifically during The Indie Game Awards show.</p>



<p>“Narrowing down 365 days of remarkable indie games across the 15 categories was a gargantuan task for our curation jury,” The Indie Game Awards co-creator Mike Towndrow told Insider Gaming. “But the list we’ve landed on is a killer reflection of how much the indie scene has stepped up this year. </p>



<p>He added: “Take the Game of the Year category, for example. Those 10 games represent an incredibly diverse range of elements we all look for when discussing some of the greatest games of all time. They’re a perfect snapshot of how indies continue to push the boundaries and drive the industry forward.”</p>



<p>As mentioned, Game of the Year, the biggest award of the show, has 10 games nominated. Those games include 1000xRESIST, ARCO, Animal Well, Balatro, Lorelei and the Laser Eyes, Neva, Nine Sols, UFO 50, Mouthwashing, and Crypt Custodian.</p>



<p>“Our goal is for The Indie Game Awards to become the definitive annual celebration of the indie scene,” Towndrow said. “That endgame vision is made possible through the deep collaboration we’ve built with fellow indie showcases, organizations, journalists, content creators, and, of course, the developers themselves. </p>



<p>“And this is just the beginning. We’re more motivated than ever to expand that collaboration and scale, bringing even more individuals into the fold to make The IGAs a staple of the indie scene—a celebration that breaks through into the wider gaming industry.”</p>



<p>You can check out the full list of nominees below. Insider Gaming will have full coverage of The Indie Game Awards when they air on December 19 at 7pm ET.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-player-numbers-are-up-compared-to-last-year-seemingly-due-to-mods<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Baldur's Gate 3's players numbers are up compared to this time last year, seemingly due to official mod support from developer Larian Studios.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Larian director of publishing Michael Douse shared the improvement on <a href="https://x.com/Cromwelp/status/1858532995084271848?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">X/Twitter</a>, revealing the average daily active users is up 20% over 2023. "Mods are very good," Douse said of the improvement, referencing the release of official mod support as part of Baldur's Gate 3 Patch 7.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Dungeons &amp; Dragons role-playing game, which released in August 2023, is also enjoying an increase of 3% in average daily peak concurrents and a 61% boost in Steam Deck users compared to last year.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This increase is impressive for a largely single-player game. Baldur's Gate 3 does have cooperative multiplayer but is not a live service that may be expected to enjoy a boost in player numbers year-on-year. And while Larian has continued to update Baldur's Gate 3 with new features and improvements, it has not released DLC for it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Mods, which are even available on console and not just PC as standard, are proving incredibly popular among Baldur's Gate 3 players. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-players-download-more-than-50-million-mods-including-10000-that-rename-withers-bone-daddy">P</a><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-players-download-more-than-50-million-mods-including-10000-that-rename-withers-bone-daddy">layers downloaded more than 50 million mods via the official mod support tool</a> in less than two months, and this number doesn't include the thousands made unofficially.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Mods released so far include <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-mod-cuts-turn-based-combat-and-makes-everything-real-time">one that adds real-time combat</a> to the otherwise turn-based RPG and another that brought entire new maps to Faerûn, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-modder-reveals-first-custom-maps-including-avernus">including the highly requested Avernus</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Patch 7 otherwise added official content including <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/karlach-is-trending-on-xtwitter-after-baldurs-gate-3-patch-7-because-her-new-evil-ending-is-absolutely-metal">an "absolutely metal" ending for Karlach</a> and a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-player-finds-scrapped-evil-ending-in-patch-7-thats-hilariously-anticlimactic">hidden evil ending</a>. Players will also be relieved to hear that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-patch-7-is-not-the-final-update-larian-confirms-but-it-doesnt-want-to-talk-about-whats-coming-just-yet">it's not the final major Baldur's Gate 3 patch after all</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-review">In our 10/10 review of Baldur's Gate 3</a>, IGN said: "With crunchy, tactical RPG combat, a memorable story with complex characters, highly polished cinematic presentation, and a world that always rewards exploration and creativity, Baldur's Gate 3 is the new high-water mark for CRPGs."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Ryan Dinsdale is an IGN freelance reporter. He'll talk about The Witcher all day.</em></p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

"This will include the development of first-of-its-kind concepts for Minecraft-themed guest accommodation, retail, and food &amp; beverage, alongside exciting experiences--including a Minecraft-themed ride--at Merlin locations in these two countries. Longer-term, Merlin will expand these experiences to other destinations globally," the company said.</p><p>Merlin runs the Legoland theme parks, as well as theme parks in the UK, Italy, and Germany, including Alton Towers Resort and Gardaland Resort. Merlin also operates what it calls "Gateway" attractions, which include Madame Tussauds, Sea Life, and attractions themed around brands like Peppa Pig and Shrek.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4402007-screenshot2024-11-19at9.04.10am.png" data-ref-id="1300-4402007" data-ratio="0.58067831449126" data-width="1946" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4402007-screenshot2024-11-19at9.04.10am.png" data-ref-id="1300-4402007"></a><figcaption>A rendering of what a Minecraft attraction could look like</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4402007-screenshot2024-11-19at9.04.10am.png"></figure><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4402008-screenshot2024-11-19at9.03.57am.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4402009-screenshot2024-11-19at9.04.03am.png" data-ref-id="1300-4402008,1300-4402009" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1179/11799911/4402008-screenshot2024-11-19at9.03.57am.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1179/11799911/4402009-screenshot2024-11-19at9.04.03am.png"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4402008-screenshot2024-11-19at9.03.57am.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4402009-screenshot2024-11-19at9.04.03am.png"></figure><p>Merlin's Magic Making team is working with Mojang to try to "ensure authenticity" for the Minecraft rides and attractions that it creates.

                <p dir="ltr">Sony, parent company of PlayStation, is reportedly in discussions to purchase Kadokawa, parent company of Elden Ring maker From Software. The two companies have been talking, and it's apparently possible an acquisition could be announced in the weeks ahead.</p><p dir="ltr">According to <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/deals/sony-talks-buy-media-powerhouse-behind-elden-ring-sources-say-2024-11-19/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Reuters</a>, a possible acquisition would see Sony own the rights to Elden Ring and future games from From Software, also known for Demon Souls (already owned by Sony) and Dark Souls (controlled by publisher Bandai Namco). Acquire, behind Tenchu, and Spike Chunsoft, behind Danganronpa, also sit under <a href="https://group.kadokawa.co.jp/global/business/game.html" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Kadokawa's umbrella</a> and presumably would be part of any merger. Sony already owns a 2% stake in the company.</p><p dir="ltr">Kadokawa's portfolio doesn't just include gaming, though. The company also has a hand in anime and manga, behind franchises like Re:Zero and Delicious in Dungeon. In 2021, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sony-completes-crunchyroll-acquisition-worth-1-175-billion/1100-6494979/" data-ref-id="1100-6494979">Sony acquired anime streaming service

            <p>
Microsoft has detailed the Xbox Game Pass titles set to be added to its subscription in the latter half of November.
</p>
<p>
This includes the launch of the long-awaited <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyl-release-times">Stalker 2: Heart of Chornobyl</a> from Ukrainian studio GSC Gameworld, plus <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/aliens-dark-descent-review-more-stand-up-fight-than-bug-hunt">pretty decent tactics title Aliens: Dark Descent</a>, originally launched last year, if you have Xbox Game Pass Ultimate or PC Game Pass. 
</p>
<p>
You'll also need Ultimate or PC Game Pass if you want to play Nine Sols, an arty action-platformer that's inspired by Sekiro's combat. But, as you can see below, vanilla Game Pass members do get some new additions too.
</p>
<p>
Here's everything included with Xbox Game Pass in late November:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 (Cloud, PC, and Xbox Series X|S), Game Pass Ultimate, PC Game Pass - 19th November</li>
<li>Stalker 2: Heart of Chornobyl (Cloud, PC, and Xbox Series X|S), Game Pass Ultimate, PC Game Pass  - 20th November</li>
<li>Little Kitty, Big City (Console), now with Game Pass Standard  - 20th November</li>
<li>PlateUp! (Console), now with Game Pass Standard  - 20th November</li>
<li>Nine Sols (Cloud, PC, and Xbox Series X|S), Game Pass Ultimate, PC Game Pass  - 26th November</li>
<li>Aliens: Dark Descent (Cloud, PC, and Xbox Series X|S), Game Pass Ultimate, PC Game Pass  - 27th November</li>
</ul>

<p>
In addition to all of those, Game Pass Ultimate members will also get a smattering of in-game rewards when <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/genshin-impact">Genshin Impact</a> finally arrives for Xbox tomorrow, Wednesday 20th November. (I'm not well-versed on the Hoyoverse, but Microsoft lists you getting two Intertwined Fate, one Northlander Billet Trove, 10 Hero's Wit, 100k Mora, and 15 Mystic Enhancement Ore, which should help you on your way.)
</p>
<p>
As Microsoft gives, so it also taketh away. As <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-game-pass-is-set-to-lose-these-6-games-at-the-end-of-the-month">partially announced yesterday</a>, here are the next set of titles due to exit the Game Pass catalogue on 30th November: 
</p>
<ul>
<li>Conan Exiles (Cloud, Console, and PC)</li>
<li>Coral Island (PC)</li>
<li>Hello Neighbor 2 (Cloud, Console, and PC)</li>
<li>Remnant: From The Ashes (Cloud, Console, and PC)</li>
<li>Rollerdrome (Cloud, Console, and PC)</li>
<li>Soccer Story (Cloud, Console, and PC)</li>
<li>Spirit of the North (Cloud, Console, and PC)</li>
<li>The Walking Dead: The Final Season (PC)</li>
<li>While the Iron's Hot (Cloud, Console, and PC)</li>
</ul>

<p>
If you missed the announcement, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cheeky-tweet-hints-at-the-next-big-franchise-coming-to-xbox-game-pass">Microsoft added Spyro Reignited Trilogy to Xbox Game Pass</a> just a week ago.
</p>
<p>
For everything else in Microsoft's subscription service, check out our handy <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-game-pass-games-list-this-month-price-6400">Xbox Game Pass guide</a> detailing the many hundreds of titles available.

<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a> has responded to claims it removed datamined details and anonymous comments from staff who worked on <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/life-is-strange-double-exposure">Life is Strange: Double Exposure</a> at developer Deck Nine Games.
</p>
<p>
The claims arose in an <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Pricefield/comments/1gq3hq8/an_open_letter_to_square_enix_regarding_editorial/">open letter from fans</a> posted to the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/life-is-strange">Life is Strange</a> reddit r/Pricefield, which described recent content removals by "undue DMCA strikes" as attempts by Life is Strange's publisher to exert "behind-the-scenes editorial control".
</p>
<p>
Square Enix has now acknowledged it was behind the DMCA strikes, but said that "all steps were in accordance with appropriate legal requirements". 
</p>
<p>
The spat comes amid a period of tension between some diehard Life is Strange fans and both Deck Nine Games and Square Enix, sparked by story elements in last month's Double Exposure. Specifically, some fans - particularly those who post on the r/Pricefield reddit - were left disgruntled by the game's handling of fan-favourite character Chloe. ("Pricefield" is the relationship name of returning series protagonist Max Caulfield and her blue-haired BFF Chloe Price.)
</p><p>
Disapproval for how the game handles Chloe began before Double Exposure first launched, thanks to pre-release leaks that popped up from fans datamining <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/life-is-strange-double-exposures-first-two-chapters-are-mostly-good-but-making-fans-pay-extra-to-play-early-is-a-huge-mistake">the game's early access version</a> and pointed posts on social media suggesting displeasure by members of Life is Strange's original development team Don't Nod, before <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dont-nod-director-hits-out-at-hateful-comments-about-life-is-strange-double-exposure">the series' original director finally waded in to call for calm</a>.
</p>
<p>
Over on reddit, the situation was compounded by posts from several anonymous commenters who claimed to have worked on Double Exposure (and who provided some decent proof they had done so), who made a number of claims regarding how the game's story had changed through development, and been shaped by feedback from Square Enix itself.
</p>
<p>
The suggestion that Square Enix was acting to scrub mentions of this, and in particular developers allegedly speaking out of turn, sparked the open letter to be created.
</p>
<p>
"With this recent [removed post], which contained only publicly made comments by D9 and ex-D9 developers, there is no ambiguity left - Square Enix is either willfully removing non-infringing content for reasons other than infringement (which is explicitly NOT the authority or purpose of the DMCA), or doesn't believe that the great power granted to them by the DMCA should come with great responsibility," the open letter alleged. 
</p>
<p>
"One of these options is merely callous, the other is outright abuse of a system which, frustratingly, has no repercussions for abuse. We are concerned that Square Enix is attempting to editorialise this subreddit."
</p>
<p>
In response, in a statement first shared by <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2024/11/18/square-enix-accused-abusing-copyright-law-silence-fan-criticism-22018233/">Metro</a>, Square Enix said it had removed "infringing content" that included "leaks or confidential information due to breach of non-disclosure agreements and datamined content". 
</p>
<p>
The publisher's full statement lies below:
</p>
<p>
"In relation to DMCA notices, all steps taken were in accordance with appropriate legal requirements and reddit's own procedures for reporting intellectual property violations," a Square Enix spokesperson said. 
</p>
<p>
"These processes apply to infringing content shared prior to a game's release, including leaks or confidential information due to breach of non-disclosure agreements and datamined content. No DMCA notices were sent regarding any posts outside of these circumstances."
</p>
<p>
The r/Pricefield reddit community has taken Square Enix's confirmation it removed information in breach of non-disclosure agreements (NDAs) as confirmation the publisher was trying to remove confidential details that would further inflame fans. 
</p>
<p>
But while certain posts, such as <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Pricefield/comments/1gpjui3/help_the_copyright_notices_are_being_taken_too_far/">this summary of developer comments</a>, have been removed, Eurogamer is still able to find various original comments by users claiming to be Deck Nine staff still remaining, alongside photos of physical items related to the game's development they posted as proof of their identity. 
</p><p>
In <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/life-is-strange-double-exposure-review">Eurogamer's Life is Strange: Double Exposure review</a>, I described Chloe's storyline in the game as "wholly believable" and that, ultimately, there was little room for the character this time around - even if her absence could have been handled better.
</p>
<p>
"There are good reasons other than nostalgia and fan familiarity for why a solo return to Max is interesting," I wrote. "Still, could this inevitable reaction have been handled better by the game, had the desire seemingly been there? Sure."
