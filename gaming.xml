            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/fatal-fury-city-of-wolves-preview-revved-up-and-ready<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>There's a <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/tekken-8">lot to be excited about</a> right now in the <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/street-fighter-6">fighting game community</a>, with <em>Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves</em> being the next big thing on the horizon. SNK's upcoming title is the first new Fatal Fury in 26 years, and it's coming in revved up and ready to rock.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I spent roughly an hour with it at Summer Game Fest Play Days, and I walked away impressed with how great it looks and feels. It's got an attractive cel-shaded art style that looks great in motion, and it really helps these characters shine from neutral to super.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Like the overarching trend in fighting games, it goes for a break-neck pace where rounds are often over in less than a minute. On top of that, the newly introduced REV meter is both generated and lost within a round, encouraging liberal use of it.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I used most of my time to play as Preecha, a kickboxing rushdown type of character. I usually gravitate toward speedy fighters, and she seemed to fit the bill for me.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Controlling her felt pretty good thanks to the responsive inputs with clear visual feedback. I quickly picked up some short combos, and after learning her special inputs, they were easy to execute at the end of a combo.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Like with many 2D fighting games, I found a meter that can be burned for supers, but above that, I found the newly introduced REV meter.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To be honest, I haven’t quite cracked the code for all the ways you can utilize it—and I wasn’t alone. According to one of the people at the SNK booth, other journalists and content creators kept coming back to keep getting more of a feel for the game and its systems.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Pressing both kicks or punches along with your input would overdrive your special moves (called a REV Art), which in turn builds up the REV meter. I was playing on stick, but the button labeled R1 would also do a special attack that rushed forward and built REV, as well.&nbsp;</p>
<p>It’s not ideal to just spam these moves though; maxing out the REV meter put me in a state of overheat, which put me at risk of getting into the vulnerable Guard Crush state. It also bars you from using REV moves, which is a heavy disadvantage.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You could chain REV Arts together using a technique called REV Accel, but I didn’t have time to figure that out and get a feel for it in a match. There’s also an ultra-powerful move called a REV Blow, which requires you to have a full super meter and to have your Selective Potential Gear active.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Like I said earlier, there’s a lot of systems to chew on here.&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves </em>is chasing that fast-paced action that recent games like <em>Street Fighter 6</em> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/opinions/guilty-gear-strive-changed-fighting-games-rollback-netcode"><em>Guilty Gear Strive</em></a> are going for. However, it’s also got a boatload more systems on top of everything, creating a potentially complex game.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I barely scratched the surface in my time with Fatal Fury: City of the Wolves, and maybe after more time with it, everything will click more easily. All I know is, I’m interested to see more of it when it comes out in early 2025.&nbsp;</p>

On crime-hub planet Mirogana, neon signs inject bright pops of color into dark, seedy alleyways, droids cook strange foods at little stalls, and citizens enjoy some back-alley gambling.

<p>Following the game’s first-ever map expansion, players will receive a new quest introducing Skyline Valley and its storyline. But the introductory quest proves rather challenging, mostly due to bugs, and it pays to have a helping hand! Here is how to complete An Unlikely Invitation in Fallout 76!</p>



<h2 id="h-where-to-find-the-vault-tec-broadcast-source">Where to Find the Vault-Tec Broadcast Source</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Screenshot by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p>After downloading the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/whats-new-fallout-76-skyline-valley-answered/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new Skyline Valley update</a>, upon loading into the game for the first time, you’ll receive a new radio station. It’s a Vault-Tec Broadcast, and it warns of a distressing situation that requires all hands on deck from Vault-Tec representatives like yourself.</p>



<p>You must track down the location, which is just north of Sutton. If you check the map screenshot above, you can see Sutton and my position at the crash site. That fork in the road is where you want to travel, and you can reach it by heading east of the Overseer’s Camp.</p>



<h2 id="h-where-to-find-alyssa">Where to Find Alyssa</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Screenshot by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p>It took me longer than I’d like to admit to actually find Alyssa upon discovering the crash site. Thankfully, it wasn’t ineptitude. It turns out that this introduction quest to Skyline Valley is actually extremely buggy, and sometimes, Alyssa won’t spawn in your game. If that happens, return to the main menu and find a new server. Once you load back in, you’ll receive a quest marker pointing you directly to her position.</p>



<p>She’s usually in one of two spots: beside the vault door or at the farmhouse just down the road.</p>



<figure><figcaption>Screenshot by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>







<h2 id="h-where-to-find-vault-63">Where to Find Vault 63</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Screenshot by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p>Upon speaking with Alyssa, she’ll explain where to find Vault 63. Her directions, however, leave something to be desired. She tells you it’s somewhere down south in the Ash Heap. She doesn’t offer any more specifics, so we will!</p>



<p>If you check the screenshot above, you’ll note Vault 63 sits between Hornwright  Testing Site #03 and Garrahan Estate, about as far south as you can go on this portion of the map. Expect to pay approximately 30 Caps to fast-travel down here.</p>



<p>That completes An Unlikely Invitation in Fallout 76!</p>

  <p id="UWrcv7"><a href="https://www.polygon.com/23423671/house-dragon-season-1-review"><em>House of the Dragon </em>season 1</a> did a <em>lot</em>: It set the scene for <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23415231/house-dragon-green-blacks-dance-dragons-explained">a Targaryen civil war</a>, followed <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23328660/house-dragon-viserys-iron-throne-cut">the waning glory days</a> of a <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23289594/house-of-the-dragon-viserys-ned-stark">peacetime king</a>, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23321995/house-dragon-crabfeeder-stepstones-free-cities-explained">fit in the story of a quick war</a> before it got to the main event, and even traced the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23405268/house-dragon-alicent-rhaenyra-targaryen-episode">dissolution of</a> <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23408716/house-dragon-criston-cole-kill-beesbury-dingus">several relationships</a> (<a href="https://www.polygon.com/23380542/house-dragon-game-thrones-death-episode-7">all while forging</a> <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23361934/house-dragon-episode-5-review-recap">new ones</a>). It jumped in time with calculated abandon, with a 10-year jump between episode 5 and 6. Given all that was packed into the first season, it would be easy to forget details here and there. Remember how important <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23356938/house-dragon-green-dress-alicent-wedding">that green dress was</a> to the shifting allegiances? <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23336090/house-dragon-episode-3-review-crabfeeder-targaryen">Remember the Crabfeeder</a>?! </p>
<p id="5CxZdl">It’s possible you’re saying, “Oh shit, I really don’t.” Fret not; that makes sense! <em>House of the Dragon</em>’s time jumps make George R.R. Martin’s “history” of Westeros from the book <em>Fire &amp; Blood</em> come alive with equal significance. Knowing that every week, viewers would catapult ahead by a few months, or even years, meant episodes could just deliver the good stuff. <em>Game of Thrones</em> found epic scale in the map (which it often had to cut corners to fully chart); <em>House of the Dragon</em> finds that same scope in time. Plus, HBO anticipated this. It prepared an easy-to-digest recap video you can watch to remember the finer points of season 1 ahead of the second-season premiere (as you can see above). </p>
<p id="mA1GF3">But if you need a little more of a timeline about where — and, more importantly, <em>when —</em> all this is taking place, we’ve got a handy guide for you. With Rhaenyra (now Emma D’Arcy) and her story charting a few decades’ worth of Westeros history, it can be handy to remember how long all these players have been circling each other, or even just how much younger her brother/rival Aegon (<a href="https://www.polygon.com/23368925/house-dragon-kids-who-rhaenyra-alicent-daemon-jace-joffrey-aegon">now played by Tom Glynn-Carney</a>) is than her. </p>

<p id="FddagY">Martin documents time in his A Song of Ice and Fire texts using a B.C./A.D. equivalent called “AC,” an abbreviation for “After the Conquest.” In 1 AC, Aegon I Targaryen was crowned king after conquesting his way through Westeros.</p>
<p id="oAHcy4"><em>House of the Dragon </em>opens in 101 AC, 197 years before the events of <em>Game of Thrones</em>’ first season. We get one major scene in this time period: King Jaehaerys I Targaryen announcing that, after his son Baelon kicked the bucket, his new heir would not be the genealogical choice of his eldest grandchild, Princess Rhaenys, but his eldest grand<em>son</em>, Prince Viserys. What we don’t see is Jaehaerys die — in 103 AC, according to <em>Fire &amp; Blood</em> — and pass the crown to Viserys.</p>
<h2 id="1ZssY0"><strong>Later in episode 1, aka most of ‘The Heirs of the Dragon’</strong></h2>
<p id="l8PGfp">It’s tough to say <em>exactly</em> when <em>House of the Dragon</em> gets going, but a title card explains that the show picks up nine years into King Viserys’ reign. Do the math, and we’re at around 112 AC.</p>
<p id="JJDnI1">This is when Rhaenyra loses her mother (and Viserys his wife and queen), and — mostly as a way to spurn Daemon — Viserys declares Rhaenyra his heir. </p>
<h2 id="usCySd"><strong>Episode 2, ‘The Rogue Prince’</strong></h2>
<p id="0CRf7K">The show’s first time jump leaps ahead by six months, as tensions with Daemon Targaryen — not to mention the factions in the Stepstones — begin to escalate. Daemon is squatting in Dragonstone with Mysaria, who he claims (read: lies) is carrying his heir as he makes a play for the throne. Rhaenyra sees through him and collects some dragon eggs he has. Also everyone is trying to marry their daughters to Viserys, but ultimately Otto Hightower succeeds in getting his daughter (and Rhaenyra’s best friend!) Alicent betrothed to him. </p>
<h2 id="iBS18M"><strong>Episode 3, ‘Second of His Name’</strong></h2>
<p id="oNNVk2">Three years later — so, around 115 AC — shit is getting real in the Stepstones. Whatever talk of war there was back in episode 2 has exploded into true violence, with Prince Daemon wiping out the Crabfeeder with the help of Lord Corlys Velaryon. This is also when Alicent Hightower is quite pregnant with her and Viserys’ first kid, who we’ll eventually see as more of a worthy heir to the throne after the next time jump.</p>
<h2 id="KB3emq"><strong>Episode 4, ‘King of the Narrow Sea’</strong></h2>

<p id="sznvEz">The time jump in episode 4 is a bit murky, but we know that Princess Rhaenyra Targaryen has been urged to find a husband, and has spent at least a couple of months since Daemon’s triumph looking for someone worth her while. This is also when Daemon and Rhaenyra <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23344676/house-dragon-episode-4-review-targaryen">have a bit of a fling</a>. Here, the show diverges from Martin’s <em>Fire &amp; Blood </em>timeline, which saw Daemon pronouncing himself King of the Narrow Sea around 109 AC.</p>
<h2 id="4KR4yo"><strong>Episode 5, ‘We Light the Way’</strong></h2>
<p id="JaMZnx"><em>House of the Dragon</em> and its source material continue to split in episode 5. Most of Daemon’s exploits in <em>Fire &amp; Blood</em> are taking place around 115 AC, but when we pick up with the troubled fella, likely around 114 AC on the show, he’s already staging his new-ish wife Lady Rhea Royce’s untimely death. We also see Rhaenyra’s wedding to Ser Laenor Velaryon, which has been slightly shifted up in time from when it occurs in the books. But Condal has lined it all up to make history more digestible for when the big jump happens...</p>
<h2 id="pxX5ZG"><strong>Episode 6, ‘The Princess and the Queen’</strong></h2>
<p id="ic2jyd">The <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23368852/house-of-the-dragon-time-jump-cast-episode-6-review">halfway point of <em>House of the Dragon</em>’s first season</a> makes a 10-year time jump (confirmed when Laenor says, “And I have played my part here, faithfully... for 10 years”) to around 124 AC. As anyone who has flipped through Martin’s <em>Fire &amp; Blood</em> will tell you: This is when shit gets ugly. And it’s already been pretty ugly. But at least we know when the ugly shit is happening.</p>

<p id="sHtbOa">The calm before the storm, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23393628/house-dragon-episode-8-review-viserys-wound-death">“The Lord of the Tides” picks up six years</a> after “Driftmark,” so around 130 AC. Both Rhaenyra’s and Alicent’s children are grown, and Viserys is near fully grown — in fact, this is the episode he dies. Unfortunately, his death comes mere moments after Alicent and Rhaenyra were about to bury the hatchet, and seconds after Alicent misunderstands Viserys’ last words, and mistakenly believes he called for Aegon to be king after all. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/phantom-blade-zero-summer-game-fest-hands-on-impressions-beautiful-and-stylish/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>As one of the hardest demo appointments to get into at Summer Game Fest's Play Days, we were excited to get hands-on with a quick thirty-minute demonstration of <a href="https://wccftech.com/phantom-blade-zero-qa-dev-says-bosses-are-the-games-highlights-confirms-hardware-ray-tracing-ps5-specs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Phantom Blade Zero</a>. Hardcore action titles such as this can have such a different vibe between watching someone else play the game during an online stream versus being able to pick up a controller and play for yourself. It was during Summer Game Fest 2024 that we finally got a brief taste of the Wuxia action players can look forward to in Phantom Blade Zero, a title that needs no introduction nor experience with the studio's prior titles as this is intended to be a prequel to the other Phantom Blade titles.</p>
<p>Draped in a bleak and muted aesthetic, the villages and temples of Phantom Blade Zero are secondary to the player character and the multi-faceted combat. The demo opens with a quick tutorial, running through the basics of traversal from jumping, crouching through narrow openings, and sprints before stumbling across a lone enemy that’s the perfect punching bag to serve as a tutorial to the combat. S-Games <a href="https://wccftech.com/phantom-blade-zero-not-soulslike/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reiterated</a> that they don’t want to be considered a Soulslike title. Instead, one of the developers mentioned that they’re bringing back the classic “combo-driven traditional action into a Souls map” and how it’s a fusion of the two archetypes. There’s a cinematic Wuxia style to the combat that will leave players quite surprised as they learn how to take off their Souls blinders and approach Phantom Blade Zero with new eyes.</p>
<p>Rather than the simplified swordplay of your typical Soulsborne title, where R1 might only have a couple of standard hits before repeating the cycle, Phantom Blade Zero instead leans into its roots as a character action title. Combos are driven through strings of Square and Triangle presses, chaining together in 'Sha-Chi' combos meant to whittle down the enemy’s defenses and break their guard. For defensive mechanics, there is a standard block stance that can block both standard and blue-tinted Brutal Moves (these drain a significant chunk of stamina and are better off parried) as the main tool, but players can also tap the same block button to initiate a parry. By parrying an attack by tapping the L1 button, players will perform a 'Ghostep' and get behind the target for a quick counter. Red-tinted Killer Moves, on the other hand, cannot be blocked or parried and must either be sidestepped or tap the R1 button to counter with the same Ghostep ability. Jumping and dodging with sidesteps are the tried-and-true defensive abilities, but the delicate dance with parrying and counters will turn S-Games’ inaugural console title into something very different from what players are used to.</p>
<p>Weapons discovered throughout Phantom Blade Zero might share some similarities in their basic combos, but the intended effect can be quite different between them. During an earlier preview at IGN Live, the developers mentioned that there will be thirty different weapons available in the full release. The common Dao sword provides the highest average of speed and power, while a pair of Sanguine twinblades might trade off a lower amount of damage per hit in exchange for higher pressure and burning through the stamina of a blocking enemy. Beating an enemy boss in the second segment rewarded me with his oversized dadao for use in the third. Sometimes, the best approach is to begin a combo with a faster striking weapon, swap mid-combo to the secondary weapon, throw in a Phantom Edge like the lion’s head flamethrower, and continue the pressure until the boss is staggered. There’s a massive variety in how to approach the combat and dodge-cancels to shift out of attack animations or reset the combo giving players some insanely stylish ways to best their foes. It’s because of the high skill ceiling to the melee combat that I don’t want to liken Phantom Blade Zero to a Soulslike, but rather Team Ninja's Nioh and Ninja Gaiden Black.</p>
<p><iframe title="Phantom Blade Zero Summer Game Fest 2024 Gameplay - First Ten Minutes" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mO7r2jEDOo4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Phantom Blade Zero features large combat arenas that are multi-layered by design, featuring paths for players to explore that will yield hidden treasure chests or the occasional enemy hiding just out of sight around a corner. In the gameplay demo, all the interactive objects and chests were disabled, preventing players from getting an early look at the loot and collectibles. By doing so, they force the player to focus on the action and moment-to-moment gameplay rather than seeking out something that would only be useful in the full game. Many of the higher elevated sections of the environment allow players to sneak attack enemies from above or even snipe them from out of harm's way using one of their iconic Phantom Edges: the longbow. In one of the live showcases shown off elsewhere, the developers talked about some of the contextual movement options, such as slowly sliding down walls and jumping off to find secret areas.</p>
<p>Thirty minutes wasn’t nearly enough time to satisfy my craving to finally get hands-on with Phantom Blade Zero. If nothing else, my time with the Summer Game Fest demo was like a small appetizer meant to increase my appetite for the full game. Once assumed to be a PlayStation 5 exclusive, Phantom Blade Zero will also be available on PC, although a release year hasn’t yet been confirmed by Soulframe Liang, Founder and CEO at S-Game.</p>

			<p>Files for a canceled Cyberpunk 2077 DLC expansion surfaced online, providing new information on the expansion and new lore that could hint at some of the events that will happen in the second entry in the series.</p>
<p>The files, as reported on the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1dg3yxq/files_from_a_cancelled_cyberpunk_2077_expansion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gaming Leaks and Rumors subreddit</a>, confirm how the expansion was supposed to take place during a new corporate war, an event that a lot of in-game text suggested was going to happen at some point, and that the moon map would have been around six square kilometers big (for reference, Night City is around 24 square kilometers big.). Multiple bases were also supposed to be included in this new map and a rover vehicle would have helped V explore the new map.</p>
<p>It's disappointing that this Cyberpunk 2077 expansion will never see the light of day, considering how good Phantom Liberty turned out to be. However, at the very least, there's the chance this new corporate war and some of the other events this DLC was supposed to cover will make their way onto the game's sequel, which officially started development <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-warm-up-sequel/">earlier this year.</a></p>
<p>Cyberpunk 2077 is now available on PC, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S and Xbox One. You can learn more about the aforementioned Phantom Liberty expansion by checking out Alessio's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/cyberpunk-2077-phantom-liberty-shiny-firmware-update/">review.</a></p>

		<p>A <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/red-dead-redemption">Red Dead Redemption</a> PC release is seemingly on the horizon, well over a decade since its original release on PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360.</p>
<p>This follows a recent <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/epic-games-store">Epic Games Store</a> leak with backend data from Epic’s digital storefront being made available to the public via EpicDB (which is currently offline). This data included codenames for unannounced games – including a new Turok title and a <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/final-fantasy-ix">Final Fantasy IX</a> remake – as well as patch information, release dates, and file sizes.</p>
<p><iframe title="Red Dead Redemption and Undead Nightmare - Coming to PS4 | PS5 &amp; PS4 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FDdT8zMl7Xc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Some details regarding the Red Dead Redemption PC port were also <a href="https://gtaforums.com/topic/997050-red-dead-redemption-coming-to-pc/?do=findComment&amp;comment=1072391756">uncovered</a> – specifically, the game’s file size. Codenamed “Semla” on the Epic Games Store, data shows that RDR will weigh in at just over 10GB when it launches on PC, presumably at some point in the near future.</p>
<p>Rockstar has yet to formally announce its acclaimed cowboy sim for PC, though last month a reference to the game was <a href="https://x.com/TezFunz2/status/1790038268630663441">discovered</a> within the Rockstar Games Launcher with a brief synopsis of the game and a mention of its Undead Nightmares expansion.</p>

<p>Originally released in 2010, Red Dead Redemption was made one of the first champions of the Xbox One’s backwards compatibility program with a 2018 update that added 4K and a smoother framerate. The beloved Rockstar classic was also ported to both Nintendo Switch and PlayStation 4 last year, the latter version prompting fans to ask why a PS5 version running at 60 frames per second wasn’t also released.</p>
<p>In our original <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2010/05/19/review-red-dead-redemption/">Red Dead Redemption review</a> we scored the game a masterful 10/10, saying:</p>
<p>“Rockstar San Diego’s latest title is an unmissable game for any fan of the genre or great action adventures in general. We don’t often get masterpieces around here, but this is certainly one of those moments in time when gamers will look back more fondly on a dusty old six shooter than anything that involves jacking cars. The Wild West, then, is the new New York, and Rockstar have got their work cut out for them if they want Grand Theft Auto V to come anywhere near close to the majesty of Red Dead Redemption. A job we don’t envy.”</p>
<p>With gamers eagerly counting down to <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/grand-theft-auto-vi">Grand Theft Auto VI</a>, little has been said about the future of RDR. With support for Red Dead Online having been scaled back massively, our hope is that RDR 2 will eventually get an upgrade of re-release on newer consoles at some point in the near future.</p>

            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/06/15/playstation-plus-premium-update-is-great-news-for-ps1-ps2-psp-fans/</link>

		<p><a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/sony">Sony</a> has quietly made changes to its <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/playstation-plus">PlayStation Plus</a> Premium lineup, much to the delight of retro gamers. Since PS Plus relaunched in 2022, those paying for its highest priced subscription tier have been able to access a growing pool of revamped Classics, selected from a library of PS1, PS2, and PSP software.</p>
<p><iframe title="Introducing the all-new PlayStation Plus | PS5 &amp; PS4 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5StHEUsIV3Q?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Through emulation, these games aren’t just playable on newer Sony consoles, they also come tagged with some pretty cool features with up-rendering and video filter options, as well as the ability to quick save, and even a handy rewind. What’s made some of these upgraded PlayStation Plus Premium Classics particularly appealing is the addition of trophies. Not only are you getting a big nostalgia hit, you’re also hoarding more virtual silverware for your in-game feats.</p>
<p>There’s a caveat, however. While some of these older games offer full trophy support, others simply don’t. Typically, if it’s a game that was developed by one of Sony’s first party studios there’s a good chance there will be trophies up for grabs – look at the upgraded <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/syphon-filter">Syphon Filter</a> trilogy, for example.</p>
<p>With that said, a small number of PlayStation Classics have quietly received an update adding trophy support with recent examples including Toy Story 2, Alone in the Dark: The New Nightmare, or <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/oddworld">Oddworld:</a> Abe’s Exoddus. Hopefully this is an indication that other titles previously added to PlayStation Plus Premium will get the same treatment.</p>


<p>Sony hasn’t directly addressed this, though it seems to be taking trophy support more seriously when it comes to its Classics catalogue. This can be seen with the arrival of <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/star-wars">Star Wars</a>: The Clone Wars, <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/tomb-raider">Tomb Raider</a>: Legend, and Sly Raccoon which have all been outfitted with full trophy lists.</p>
<p>Out of the gate, Sony’s Classics catalogue didn’t make PlayStation Plus Premium an essential purchase though over time it has continued to grow. Even if you’re not a trophy fiend, the handy rewind and save features adds an extra layer of playability to suit modern gamer sensibilities. That said, there are still plenty of gaps in the library of games available, not to mention a disappointing lack of support for PS3 titles which can only be streamed via PS Plus and not directly downloaded.</p>
<p>Needless to say, the top tier of PS Plus still has some issues to iron out before it can truly be branded as the go-to haven for retro PlayStation gamers, though it’s certainly making progress.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/sea-of-thieves-player-count-ps5-drop/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>In a recent report, it was claimed that 58% of Sea of Thieves’ PlayStation 5 player base decided to make port and retire from sailing the ocean less than a month after the game was released on the platform. This news comes just days after it was revealed that Sea of Thieves was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sea-of-thieves-digital-download-charts-playstation/">the most downloaded game on PlayStation</a> in North America and Europe through May.</p>



<p>Is this high-rated live-service title already at risk of failing after appearing on an all-new platform?</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-sinking-ships">Sinking Ships</h2>



<p>In a report <a href="https://www.truetrophies.com/news/sea-of-thieves-ps5-player-count-drop" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">written by TrueTrophies</a> using data from GameInsights, it was suggested that a whopping 58% of all Sea of Thieves players migrated away from the title within one month. It was recognised that the game had a strong start on the platform, but that was likely on account of it being the first time Sea of Thieves surfaced on PlayStation since being released in 2018. It was the latest in a modest line of Xbox-exclusive games to be ported to PlayStation platforms, joining the likes of Grounded and Pentiment.</p>



<p>There’s a natural lifecycle that plays out with every game, and a drop is expected, but almost 60% of players evacuating a live-service game in just a couple of weeks is fairly drastic. </p>



<p>Sea of Thieves is getting on in years but it continues to be updated with a regular cadence that keeps a core community connected and appreciative of the game. Several major changes just unravelled within the game’s ecosystem, and there are no indications that Rare – the game’s developer – will be done with it any time soon.</p>

<p>In October 2023, Spider-Man 2 was released on PlayStation 5 to an overwhelmingly popular reception, quickly becoming regarded as one of the platform’s top games. However, shortly after, a massive leak occurred at Insomniac Games, Spider-Man’s developer, revealing a sizeable portion of the studios’ roadmap, developing projects, cut content, and much more. </p>



<p>Recently, images started appearing online of an early Spider-Man 3 build, and the claim is that they’re ‘leftover images’ from the original leaks that surfaced in December 2023.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-spider-man-3-confirmed">Spider-Man 3 Confirmed?</h2>



<p>It seems obvious that a third Spider-Man game will surface – but fans are still awaiting any major expansions for the second game that was released a little more than seven months ago. On social media, <a href="https://x.com/zvis_ceral/status/1801605499835556088" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a string of images have surfaced</a> showing what’s purported to be Spider-Man 3 – but they don’t show much. They’re a little rough around the edges, which is to be expected, and they appear to reveal Silk as a core playable character in the game.</p>



<p>Canonically, Cindy ‘Silk’ Moon was bitten by the same spider that bit Peter Parker, but she develops slightly different abilities, such as ‘Silk-Sense’, which is, as the story goes, more advanced than Parker’s Spider-Sense. She can also create her own organic webbing, circumventing the need to have web blasters attached to her wrists. In some stories, Silk has an otherworldly connection to Peter Parker on account of them being bitten by the same spider, and as such, she can detect his presence anywhere across the Multiverse.</p>



<p>Aside from that, the images show little more than a few landscapes and some posed shots of Silk zipping around the city. It was noted that she’s using Miles Morales’ moveset in these images because it’s such an early build.</p>



<p>It’s worth taking these images with a pinch of salt – the Insomniac leaks revealed one hell of a lot of content, but that doesn’t mean that anything claimed to be linked with it is immediately real.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Files For Cancelled Cyberpunk ‘Moon’ DLC Appear Online]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/cyberpunk-cancelled-dlc-moon/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/files-for-cancelled-cyberpunk-%E2%80%98moon%E2%80%99-dlc-appear-online.902223/</guid>

<p>Cyberpunk 2077 could probably be regarded as the defining ‘rags to riches’ game of our lifetime. It emerged in 2020 to a woeful reception, boasting more bugs than any game ever released (probably) and hitting an all-time low with fans in terms of sentiment. It was an absolute shocker for CDPR, but it was ultimately turned around, and by the time the game’s first and only expansion was released, it was regarded as one of the best open-world games ever made.</p>



<p>Recently, evidence emerged online of a cancelled DLC set on the Moon, which has plenty of lore around it in the Cyberpunk universe. In a series of images, we see concept art, blueprints, file repositories, and some map-based data for what might have been the first out-of-map expansion for Cyberpunk 2077.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-never-going-to-get-it">Never Going To Get It</h2>



<p>Phantom Liberty was released in September 2023 and emerged as one of the best expansions for a game ever made. It heralded a new generation of Cyberpunk 2077, which from then was penned as ‘Cyberpunk 2077 2.0’ – and for good reason. It was the ultimate turning point for the title, with CDPR signing off and acknowledging that the game was in the best state it would ever be.</p>



<p>Recently, images <a href="https://boards.4chan.org/v/thread/679700797" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">emerged on social media</a> diving into the discovery of an unnamed Moon-based expansion for Cyberpunk 2077. In the game’s universe, the Moon has been colonised and cities have been built on the rocky satellite. It’s being used for resources and is a key point of interest for the corporations that effectively run Earth by the time of Cyberpunk 2077’s story. It reportedly has a population of around 58,000 people, and it would have served as the base of operations for Cyberpunk 2077’s second and final expansion.</p>



<p>In the string of images uploaded online, we get a look at file repositories, a rough map of the proposed Moon location, and shots of some early conceptual images and set pieces. As the story goes, CDPR originally intended for the Moon to be a featured location in the base game but recognised that it was too ambitious a goal, so they cut the content and instead decided to use it for an expansion – which ultimately never surfaced.</p>



<p>Cyberpunk 2077’s development has officially ended, so there’s no chance this will ever see the light of day.</p>

<!-- cache hit 1:single/related:41722374be77d946703ad465fcf26d84 --><!-- empty -->
<p>On Friday, a retired software engineer named Martin C. Martin <a href="https://martincmartin.com/2024/06/14/how-i-found-a-55-year-old-bug-in-the-first-lunar-lander-game/">announced</a> that he recently discovered a bug in the original <em>Lunar Lander</em> computer game's physics code while tinkering with the software. Created by a <a href="https://technologizer.com/2009/07/19/lunar-lander/index.html">17-year-old high school student named Jim Storer</a> in 1969, this primordial game rendered the action only as text status updates on a <a href="https://www.pcmag.com/news/the-forgotten-world-of-teletype-computer-games">teletype</a>, but it set the stage for future versions to come.</p>

<p>The legendary game—which Storer developed on a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PDP-8">PDP-8</a> minicomputer in a programming language called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FOCAL_(programming_language)">FOCAL</a> just months after Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin made their historic moonwalks—allows players to control a lunar module's descent onto the Moon's surface. Players must carefully manage their fuel usage to achieve a gentle landing, making critical decisions every ten seconds to burn the right amount of fuel.</p>
<p>In 2009, just short of the 40th anniversary of the first Moon landing, I set out to find the author of the original <em>Lunar Lander</em> game, which was then primarily known as a graphical game, thanks to the <a href="http://www.brouhaha.com/~eric/retrocomputing/dec/gt40/">graphical version</a> from 1974 and a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_Lander_(1979_video_game)">1979 Atari arcade title</a>. When I discovered that Storer created the oldest known version as a teletype game, I interviewed him and wrote up <a href="https://technologizer.com/2009/07/19/lunar-lander/index.html">a history of the game</a>. Storer later <a href="https://www.cs.brandeis.edu/~storer/LunarLander/LunarLander.html">released the source code</a> to the original game, written in FOCAL, on his website.</p>

<p>Fast forward to 2024, when Martin—an AI expert, game developer, and former postdoctoral associate at MIT—stumbled upon a bug in Storer's high school code while exploring what he believed was the optimal strategy for landing the module with maximum fuel efficiency—a technique known among <a href="https://arstechnica.com/science/2018/12/video-astronaut-scott-kelly-teaches-orbital-mechanics-with-kerbal-space-program/"><em>Kerbal Space Program</em></a> enthusiasts as the "suicide burn." This method involves falling freely to build up speed and then igniting the engines at the last possible moment to slow down just enough to touch down safely. He also tried another approach—a more gentle landing.</p>                                            
                                                        
<p>"I recently explored the optimal fuel burn schedule to land as gently as possible and with maximum remaining fuel," Martin wrote on his blog. "Surprisingly, the theoretical best strategy didn’t work. The game falsely thinks the lander doesn’t touch down on the surface when in fact it does. Digging in, I was amazed by the sophisticated physics and numerical computing in the game. Eventually I found a bug: a missing 'divide by two' that had seemingly gone unnoticed for nearly 55 years."</p>
<h2>A matter of division</h2>
<figure><a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Apollo_Spacecraft_diagram.jpg" data-height="459" data-width="720" alt="Diagram of launch escape system on top of the Apollo capsule."></a><figcaption><p><a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Apollo_Spacecraft_diagram.jpg" data-height="459" data-width="720">Enlarge</a> <span>/</span> Diagram of launch escape system on top of the Apollo capsule.</p><p>NASA</p></figcaption></figure>
<p>Despite applying what should have been a textbook landing strategy, Martin found that the game inconsistently reported that the lander had missed the Moon's surface entirely. Intrigued by the anomaly, Martin dug into the game's source code and discovered that the landing algorithm was based on highly sophisticated physics for its time, including the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tsiolkovsky_rocket_equation">Tsiolkovsky rocket equation</a> and a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taylor_series">Taylor series</a> expansion.</p>
<p>As mentioned in the quote above, the root of the problem was a simple computational oversight—a missing division by two in the formula used to calculate the lander's trajectory. This seemingly minor error had big consequences, causing the simulation to underestimate the time until the lander reached its lowest trajectory point and miscalculate the landing.</p>

<p>Despite the bug, Martin was impressed that Storer, then a high school senior, managed to incorporate advanced mathematical concepts into his game, a feat that remains impressive even by today's standards. Martin reached out to Storer himself, and the <em>Lunar Lander</em> author told Martin that his father was a physicist who helped him derive the equations used in the game simulation.</p>
<p>While people played and enjoyed Storer's game for years with the bug in place, it goes to show that realism isn't always the most important part of a compelling interactive experience. And thankfully for Aldrin and Armstrong, the real Apollo lunar landing experience didn't suffer from the same issue.</p>

<p>Longtime fans of <em>Diablo II</em> are deeply familiar with the extreme timesink that is <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/02/diablo-ii-streamer-finds-1-in-3-million-item-drop-instantly-sells-it-for-laughs/">the late-game grind for the very best loot</a>. But when the creators of <em>Diablo IV</em> tried to re-create that style of grinding for the latest game in the series, they found that their players' tastes had changed quite a bit in the intervening years.
</p><p>In <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/is-there-a-paladin-in-diablo-4">a wide-ranging interview with Windows Central</a>, Blizzard's general manager of <em>Diablo</em>, Rod Fergusson, said that they launched <em>Diablo IV</em> under "the assumption that <em>D4</em> was meant to be more <em>D2</em>-like." That meant, in part, increasing the length of time required to discover the game's most valuable items after <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2014/03/diablo-3-says-goodbye-and-good-riddance-to-the-auction-house/">post-Auction-House <em>Diablo 3</em> made rare item drops much more common</a>.</p>
<p>"One of the assumptions was that people were going to be okay with the long grind for the Unique or an Uber Unique in particular, because in <em>Diablo II</em>, it can go years," Fergusson said. "You can go three years before you find the Uber you're looking for... and so we were like, okay, this is what people love about the progression of <em>D2</em>, that idea of that very long chase."</p>
<p>Once the game launched, though, Fergusson said the development team was surprised to find players complaining of how long it took to get some items—<a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/05/diablo-4-review-off-to-a-hell-of-a-good-start/">our own review</a> expressed concern about the "'loot treadmill' approach to the endgame" and "loot drops [that] seem tuned a bit low for my taste."
</p><p>"We found out very quickly that if you don't give me my Uber in my [months-long] season, then I'm upset," Fergusson said. "And so we're like, oh, wow, okay."</p>
<h2>Changing with the players</h2>
<p>To help calm those upset players, subsequent <em>Diablo IV</em> updates have <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/diablo-4/news/new-sources-of-resplendent-sparks-coming-in-diablo-4-season-4-339176">made it easier to earn Resplendent Sparks</a>, which those players can use to craft high-end Uber Unique items they've been unable to find from random item drops. Having that option to skip the randomized item search helped satisfy the desires of modern players, Fergusson said.</p>                                            
                                                        
<p>"It's just a kind of recognition of how much players have changed in 20 years," he said. "You know... that consumptive nature of a live service and that time is money and I don't have much time, so let's go, right? And so that idea of like, oh, you're going to get a unique every six months."</p>
<figure><a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/d2grind.png" data-height="600" data-width="800" alt="Ah, the old-fashioned joy of finding an item with a wall of ability text."></a><figcaption><p><a href="https://cdn.arstechnica.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/d2grind.png" data-height="600" data-width="800">Enlarge</a> <span>/</span> Ah, the old-fashioned joy of finding an item with a wall of ability text.</p></figcaption></figure>
<p>That recognition of "how much players have changed" reflects how much the mere passage of time has changed the <em>Diablo</em> audience over the years. A 16-year-old who was sinking all their free time into <em>Diablo II</em> when it launched in 2000 is pushing 40 these days. That means the core, nostalgic audience for the series is now very likely to have a career, family, and/or other responsibilities eating into their playtime. There's nothing like a few decades of aging to make the prospect of sinking hundreds of hours into a loot grind seem less appealing.</p>
<p>With <em>Diablo III</em>, Blizzard initially assumed that players with more money than time would simply bid up the game's best items in <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2011/08/diablo-3-will-let-you-buy-and-sell-items-for-real-world-cash/">the game's real-money auction house</a>, where players who had more time to grind would benefit from selling their rarest random finds. Instead, Blizzard <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2013/09/diablo-3-to-permanently-remove-its-auction-houses-in-march-2014/">soon acknowledged</a> that the auction system "short-circuited [the] core reward loop" of the game, making it trivial to buy high-level loot that quickly made the entire late-game feel kind of irrelevant.</p>
<p>With <em>Diablo IV</em>, Blizzard seems to have struck a better balance for players who simply want a more reliable reward for any time investment they can make. With Resplendent Sparks, players willing to put in the in-game work can be confident that they'll eventually get the top-level items they're seeking. That consistency can be much more appealing for time-limited players than simply crossing your fingers for a low-odds virtual dice roll or opening your wallet to skip the gameplay grind process entirely.</p>
<p>The evolution of <em>Diablo</em>'s item progression system is an important reminder of how the relative value of a player's time can change as those players move between different stages of life. Who knows, maybe in 25 years <em>Diablo VI</em> will find success with ultra-rare item drops that soak up all the free time for a core audience of retirement-age players with nothing better to do than spend 500 hours grinding for a digital sword.</p>

Affected players are said to have manipulated Star Citizen’s systems to duplicate items and gain more of its in-game currency, Alpha United Earth Credits (aUEC). All aUEC gained using these methods have been removed from the ecosystem.</p><p>CIG thanks Star Citizen players for raising awareness about these issues, explaining that in-game exploits like the ones being squashed now “undermine the integrity of our game and the efforts of our dedicated backers who help us build Star Citizen.” The developer promises to continue addressing cheating players as issues arise.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/06/14/star-citizen-1718388157332.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Star Citizen exploit investigation leads to CIG suspending more than 600 accounts.</figcaption></figure></output><p>“At this stage of development, exploits and issues like these are likely to arise, which is one of the benefits of open development and working closely with our community,” CIG said. “Identifying, testing, and reporting exploits is acceptable and encouraged. We've gained valuable insights through your issue council reports, and we thank you for that. However, once an exploit is identified and confirmed, continued abuse for personal gain will not be tolerated and will result in action on our part.”</p><p>Other Star Citizen players suspect the 600 suspensions are tied to players who were selling their unauthorized credits for real-world cash. Specifically, users called out those who have taken to third-party bidding websites like eBay, where millions of aUEC is sold for anywhere from one dollar to hundreds of dollars.</p><p>“Yup, I noticed a peculiar amount of posts here recently both defending and supporting third-party aUEC sales, which is very odd to me, as gold selling/buying is an almost universally reviled practice in most MMOs,” one <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/starcitizen/comments/1df99o1/comment/l8hgqkf/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Reddit user said</u></a>. “I wouldn't even be slightly surprised if it was the exploiters themselves encouraging that BS to make a quick shady buck.”</p><p>IGN has reached out to CIG for comment.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Star Citizen is CIG’s long-in-development sci-fi game. It’s been sold as an ambitious MMO that allows players to immerse themselves within an enormous space sim experience, but despite being announced in 2012, its launch build has never actually been released.

With Christian McCaffrey as this year's cover athlete, the description of Boom Tech aligns with EA's theme of trying to pick cover athletes that best fit the new editions coming to Madden in a given year. </p><p>Additional upgrades to FieldSense, thanks to Boom Tech, are needed to "deliver increased authenticity" in offense, defense, and special teams. This includes a reloaded hit stick that will now be a skill-based mechanic, with playing ratings influencing the impact of the hit stick.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div><h3>Madden NFL 25 Cover Reveal</h3></div></output><p>To increase offensive immersion, EA notes that Ball Carrier will introduce new jukes, spins, and hesi releases. The new NFL kickoff rules will be added when the game is released this August. In addition to new branching catches, there will be new pass block strategy mechanics. </p><p>"It's been incredibly rewarding to grow with the Maden NFL experience alongside our players the past two years, and we're excited to deliver even more of the control, depth, and immersion they're looking for in Madden NFL 25," Madden NFL Senior Production Director Mike Mahar wrote in a press release. "Boom Tech has been multiple years in the making and represents the most impactful FieldSense improvement yet, and combined with a new audio and visual experience across the game, plus deepened modes and increased customization, Madden NFL 25 will look, feel, and sound different."</p><p>Madden NFL 25 is out on August 16th and is <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/madden-nfl-25-release-date-special-editions">now available for pre-order</a>.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/path-of-exile-2-gets-better-every-time-i-play-it.902130/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/path-of-exile-2-gets-better-every-time-i-play-it<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>I’ve had the opportunity to play Path of Exile 2 several times throughout its development cycle, and there’s one thought I had after my latest session: this action-RPG keeps getting better every time I play it.</p><p>The first session I had the opportunity to join was a demo at Gamescom 2023. Grinding Gear’s Jonathan Rogers took me through the Warrior and Druid class, and I also had the opportunity to wait in line and try out the Monk for the first time. As expected, I got my butt kicked. But that’s par for the course. In early 2024 I had the chance to try out the Ranger, whose incredibly fun gameplay loop has you shooting lightning arrows and propagating lightning storms of death across the screen. And more recently I got to try out the Monk again and get some hands-on time with the Warrior, Sorceress, and Witch – all for the first time. Each of them feels unique, powerful, and interesting to play as. The Monk, once you get past the early leveling portions that have you whacking away at enemies with slow and methodical staff strikes, becomes a force to be reckoned with. You can dash in to weaken your enemies, get a few charges, and then annihilate the playing field with an incredibly powerful staff strike to the ground that sends ripples of energy that rip into the earth itself. And once I got the hang of this class's gameplay loop, I felt like I may have found another new favorite.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div><h3>Path of Exile 2 Witch Gameplay</h3></div></output><p>But the majority of my time I found myself playing as the Witch, who was one of the first classes I enjoyed in the original Path of Exile. In the sequel, the Witch starts out as a corpse-reviving menace who chooses what abilities the minions will wield, and can even command them to do unique attacks to great effect.</p><p>The Unearth skill gem, for instance, will create spikes of bone that travel from the earth in front of you doing a bit of damage, but will also raise the bones of corpses as short-lived construct minions. You’ll then start unlocking Skill Gems like Skeletal Warrior, Skeletal Sniper, and Skeletal Arsonist. Because you’ll only have a set amount of spirit, early on you’ll only be able to choose one of these to get started. The Skeletal Arsonist is the option I picked as it has the unique ability to explode any low-life minion in your pack. And not only is that very cool, but it also does a ton of damage to packs of enemies or bosses that weaken your minions to explosion status.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Later, when I unlocked Bone Cage and Contagion, I was able to further expand my tool kit to create a trap for enemies, hit them with Contagion, and then watch it propagate across enemies – killing everything it touched. Even at early levels, these builds feel very fun to use and execute, and I found myself grinning from ear to ear the entire time I played as the Witch. In addition, Grinding Gear Games gave us a sneak peek at some later-game builds, and while they are interesting, I just wanted to briefly say that the gigantic skeleton that is erected by a sorcerer looks so freaking cool. Path of Exile 2 continues to surprise me with designs that are either creepy or look like they jumped straight off the cover of a heavy metal album and into the game. I’m at the point where I don’t need to see anymore. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The power progression is feeling particularly great at this moment in time.</p></div><p>The other class that I spent a significant amount of time with for the first time was the Monk. The build-up to your more powerful attacks takes a bit of time, but somehow the Monk really surprised me. You start out with a methodical smack to the enemies you’ll face, but once you start getting your Skill Gem combat kit together, the class gets really fun – and powerful – very fast. Near the end of my demo, I had the Tempest Bell Skill Gem that would drop a massive Bell onto the battlefield. When struck with any elemental Ailments, including my Frozen Locus AOE damage, it would create an elemental shockwave and deal extra freeze damage to anything in the vicinity. But my favorite combo included Killing Palm and Staggering Palm, which let me zip into battle with a Staggering Palm Strike, drop a Frozen Locus into a group of enemies, attack the bell, and finish off anyone left over with Killing Palm. That Killing Palm final blow would then give me a Power Charge that can stack up to three times. Once powered up, you could execute Falling Thunder to create a ripple of damage that tore across the map and obliterated anything that got in the way. That sounds like a bit of a setup, and it can be, but the reward just makes it so fun to pull off time and time again.</p><p>This surprisingly fun gameplay loop seems to be present for each class I’ve played so far. While there are still my personal favorites, having taken some time to try out the Sorceress and Warrior at an event the next day, I think that five seconds of fun is going to be there for all the classes. I keep finding myself grinning as I learn how that introductory Skill Gem build synergizes together in a way that’s hard not to love. More generally, Grinding Gear Games confirmed that they’ve tweaked the gameplay of these introductory moments so that they’re more enjoyable for players to learn the game in the beginner areas. And I have to say that the power progression is feeling particularly great at this moment in time.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>And that adjustment is going to go a long way for Path of Exile 2, because the developers just revealed that couch co-op will be an option for players in the same household. I tried about an hour of this, and it definitely is going to be a big selling point for anyone in the same household who wants to jump into a game and level up together. The only slightly disorienting aspect to this was the inventory menu that takes up a large portion of the screen, so hopefully your teammate isn’t bringing it up during combat too often, but otherwise, it felt pretty seamless.</p><p>A few classes are still yet to be officially revealed, but Path of Exile 2 continues to impress me every single time I get some hands-on time with it. The Ranger demo got me to roll a Ranger in the new season of Path of Exile on PC. The Monk in Path of Exile 2 surprised me as it became very powerful so early on, and it made me want to try out all the other classes to see if I’d be surprised in the same pleasant way. Path of Exile 2 will likely have a few more pre-release reveals before launch, but I am ready to dive in right now. And based on what I’ve played over the last several months, this is shaping up to be a game you should not miss. We’ll find out for sure when Path of Exile 2 goes into closed beta later this year.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-alters-branching-narrative-explained-%E2%80%93-ign-first.902127/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/the-alters-branching-narrative-explained-ign-first<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>We are our choices. It may be a cliche, but it’s true. Our choices define us: where we go, what we do, who we meet, how we handle problems, and why we are, ultimately, who we are. Imagine all the key decisions of your life laid out before you. How many would have to change to turn you into a different person? Two? Three? Or just one, in the right place, at the right time? What choice would that be for you? And who would you have become if you’d chosen differently?</p><p>Those are the questions at the core of The Alters, a narrative survival game from 11 bit Studios, the team behind This War of Mine. In The Alters, you take on the role of Jan Dolski, a simple worker on a mining mission gone horribly wrong. Stranded and alone on a strange planet after his ship crashes, Jan must figure out a way home. But he can’t do it by himself. He’ll need the help of alters, alternative versions of himself who made different choices in life and have the skills and expertise Jan needs. But alters aren’t just another body and set of skills; they’re entirely different people with unique personalities, hopes, dreams, traumas, and ambitions. To get home, Jan will need to not only get along with his alters, but make some hard choices - and come to terms with some of the choices he made in the past.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div><h3>The Alters - Gameplay Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>To better understand The Alters and how this unique set-up affects the many branching story paths you’ll encounter as you play, we sat down with game director Tomasz Kisilewicz and lead designer Rafał Włosek. The interview that follows has been lightly edited and condensed for clarity.</p><p><strong>IGN:</strong> <strong>One of the most interesting things about The Alters is, well, the alters themselves, and the branching narratives that are going to come out of the possible lives of Jan Dolski, but to understand the branches, I think we have to start with the tree. Can you tell us a little about Jan, and this predicament he finds himself in?</strong></p><p><strong>Tomasz Kisilewicz:</strong> So Jan, the main character of our game, he's got many regrets in his life, and he tends to ask himself this question, “what if?” “What if I'd made some different choices in the past? Where would I be right now?” So he's using this space mining mission that he's on as a chance to put his life on a different track, but unfortunately, things go south and he ends up all alone on this distant, desolate planet where, in order to survive and go back home, he needs to face even more tough choices, including the creation of the alters. But from that point on, the decisions he will have to make are entirely up to the players.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p><strong>IGN:</strong> <strong>The idea of basing The Alters on different outcomes of decisions Jan regrets is really interesting. Can you talk about where that idea came from, a few of those decisions, and the alters they lead to? Are there any decisions Jan doesn’t regret that become an integral part of the game’s story?</strong></p><p><strong>Kisilewicz:</strong> When we were creating the life path of Jan and designing different decisions that shaped him into who he is in the game, we really wanted this to feel relatable. So we were gathering our own experiences internally in the team, asking ourselves, what is your what-if question, what is the thing maybe you regret in your life? And they can come from different places. It can be career-related or maybe relationship-related. Things like, “what if I didn't leave my hometown? Or what if I fought harder to save this relationship I had,” things like that. In the end, we really want every player to find something relatable to them. At least one of the choices that Jan had in his past, I hope will be something the players can relate to.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>"We were gathering our own experiences internally in the team, asking ourselves, what is your what-if question, what is the thing maybe you regret in your life?"</p></div><p><strong>IGN:</strong> <strong>Creating alternate versions of yourself to get more manpower and access to different skillsets is a neat idea, but these are also different people with different hopes, dreams, fears, and regrets. Can you talk about how those things affect these different versions of Jan, and how they might behave as a result?</strong></p><p><strong>Kisilewicz:</strong> We are bringing new alters to the base in order to solve the problems that Jan, the main Jan, wouldn't be able to solve on his own. So for example, we can bring the scientist Jan, who will be able to conduct research and create a technology that will allow us to move our base, and run away from the sun. And he solves our problem. But at the same time, we are bringing a new person to the crew with an entirely new personality. Jan's scientist is a very career-driven, ambitious alter. Soon he might start undermining our decisions as a leader. So while solving one problem, we are creating new ones. And in order to effectively manage our crew and find solutions for everything, we have to really understand who they are, what is their personality, what affects them, and successfully manage them.</p><p><strong>IGN:</strong> <strong>Jan is obviously going to have to manage the relationships between himself and his alters, and probably going to have to intervene when problems arise. Can you talk about what that looks like? What are some of the things we’re going to have to manage here, and how do those decisions affect the outcome of the narrative?</strong></p><p><strong>Rafał Włosek:</strong> In order to get along with the alters well, we'll have to understand the emotions that they have and what people they become because of their life decisions. And the emotions are handled by a pretty sophisticated emotional system that is more complex than just they're feeling good or bad, and a single bar. And because of that, we can have emotions like frustration or rebellion. They may be amused by something or maybe stressed by something or saddened by something. And all those different emotions allow us to create different alters who act differently in different situations because then those emotions translate to the things they do. So they may rebel against the player or may help the player somehow, or maybe boost the morale of the crew. Or on the other hand, they may be so sad that they don't want to work anymore.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div><h3>The Alters Screenshots [2024]</h3></div></output><p><strong>IGN:</strong> <strong>Clearly, keeping all of these different versions of Jan happy is going to be a big challenge. What happens when some of the alters aren’t happy or don’t have a good relationship with our Jan or the other alters? Can you talk about how that affects the narrative? What about when they are happy, or we’ve managed to build a productive relationship?</strong></p><p><strong>Włosek:</strong> If the alters are not happy, they're angry, sad, afraid, or they're in conflict with Jan or the other alters, they may influence the game on many different levels. They may try to rebel against the player. They will lower their efficiency. They will not want to work for the mission, but they will also influence the story of themselves, of their own storylines or the stories of the other alters.</p><p>Also, there's a lot of things going on on the emergent storytelling level. So if they're in a bad shape, they may start some narrative bits that will create a different gameplay experience. But let's not forget about the fact that if the alters are in good shape and they're happy and highly motivated, they will on the other hand help the player. They will help him in achieving his goals. It'll be easier for them to fix their problems, but they can also help the other alters with fixing their problems and dealing with their past and decisions.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p><strong>IGN:</strong> <strong>One of the things that fascinates me about The Alters is the base itself, and it seems the decisions you make regarding how it is managed have the potential to have just as much impact on what can happen in the story as the other Jans do. Can you talk about that, and maybe give us some examples of how the base itself plays into what happens in the story?</strong></p><p><strong>Włosek:</strong> Base management is very important for many aspects of the game. First, it influences the economy part. Of course, this is pretty obvious, but also has to be maintained. If you don't maintain your base well, it'll deteriorate. There will be accidents. Those accidents will create emergent stories and will influence the general alter storylines or the main story. And finally, the bigger the base is, the more rapidly we can bring back home. And this is very important for Jan, for the people back on earth. So this is another way you can influence the narrative.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Base management is very important for many aspects of the game.</p></div><p><strong>IGN:</strong> <strong>The root of any good story is conflict, and there are a lot of conflicts in The Alters. We’ve got to manage our relationships with the other Jans and we have to manage the base, but it also seems like we’re in a race against time because of how the star that the planet we’re on orbits. Does the amount of time we spend on this world affect the ways the narrative can play out? If we progress very quickly, do we get access to branches in the story we wouldn’t otherwise see? If we’re struggling and taking a long time to make progress, do certain paths become closed to us?</strong></p><p><strong>Kisilewicz:</strong> We want to spend time with our Alters. We need to invest time in our relationship because only then we will be able to uncover their stories and understand them fully, and with this crew that we understand, and that we know how to manage, we will be able to succeed in the mission.</p><p>Time is a very important resource in our game. Everything we do requires some time, whether it’s excavating the resources, or crafting stuff, or conducting the research, all of the tasks require some time. And that’s why we need the alters on board, because Jan won’t be able to make everything in time. He’s being chased by a giant rising star, so he’s got this ticking clock behind his back, but at the same time, we don’t want to rush things too much.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p><strong>IGN:</strong> <strong>In the past, you’ve said that The Alters is “using a mix of classic and emergent” narrative and reflects how splitting the life of the main character opens up new paths for the story. Can you talk more about what that means, and how we’ll see that mix in the game specifically?</strong></p><p><strong>Kisilewicz:</strong> From the very beginning, we wanted to tell the story of Jan in a classic manner, but also create a game that is more open-ended and allows players more freedom in creating their own stories. So the narrative structure in our game consists of different layers. On top, we have this more classic narrative structure, which is a branching story of Jan landing on the planet and finding his way home. And it is a branching story with multiple different endings.</p><p>But underneath there is this second layer of the alter storylines, and it's up to the players what alters they create. It's not possible to have all the alters in a single playthrough. So when you replay the game, you will be able to create different alters and also within their storylines make different choices to shape their story in your own way. And underneath all of this, we have this giant layer of the emergent narrative that comes from the decisions you make. Economical decisions, strategic decisions, the way you handle your base, the way you treat your alters. It all affects them and can result in some unexpected outcomes, different reactions, different events, different mini-scenarios that can happen. In the end, we hope it all adds up to this unique experience of each player having their own unique playthrough.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p><strong>IGN:</strong> <strong>You’ve talked about how The Alters is a spiritual successor to This War of Mine, which is really interesting given the drastic change in setting and genre. Can you talk about what you learned from This War of Mine, and the impact that had on The Alters in how the story plays out, or anywhere else?</strong></p><p><strong>Włosek:</strong> And there's also the topic of emergent gameplay. This is also something that showed up in our games for the first time in This War of Mine. In The Alters, we do the same thing. We use a lot of emergent narration, but in this game, we also connect that with a more classic approach to the narration, where we have a single storyline that is branching and we enforce this storyline with those emergent systems that make this story richer.</p><p><strong>IGN:</strong> <strong>Is there any aspect of The Alters that players can’t see or isn’t immediately obvious that you’re particularly proud of, and hope players get something out of?</strong></p><p><strong>Włosek:</strong> There are a couple of mechanics in-game that I am proud of, but they're not easily visible at first glance. One of them is the emotional mechanic, which is pretty complicated. It consists of many different variables, and we don't show them as values or numbers, but more like adjectives that are floating around the alters. They have different sizes and those variables connect into even more sophisticated emotions.</p><p>And all of this makes it very hard for our analytical brain to process. But it's quite easy if you try to use your empathy to process. So the idea behind making this so complicated is not only to create different personalities for the alters that are very nuanced, but also to make the player use this proper part of the brain when they're trying to cope with alters. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div><h3>The Alters - First Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>The other thing would be the way we use the exploration. Of course, it is a tool to get a gameplay loop. You're going to go explore, look for the resources, go back to base, and face the problems with the alters, and so on. But it is quite important that we also wanted to use this exploration part to create a special environment for the player to actually think about all those decisions that the alters made and ultimately maybe create a space for them to think about their own decisions.</p><p><strong>IGN: What are you most excited for players to experience in The Alters? Is there anything we haven’t covered that you’d like folks to know about?</strong></p><p><strong>Kisilewicz: </strong>We can’t wait for the players to meet the alters, learn their different stories, and, understand what made them who they are. In the end, we just hope that everyone will find something, and learn something about themselves through the alters.</p><p><a href="https://steam.gs/l/fi2ba/IGNFirst" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wishlist</a> The Alters on Steam if you're interested to learn more.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

While this issue is potentially contributing to instability, it is not the root cause.”</p><p>Intel’s official statement references (and partially confirms) <a href="https://www.igorslab.de/en/intel-comments-internally-on-the-13th-and-14th-generation-k-sku-processor-instability-issue-and-finally-brings-a-comprehensive-update-of-its-own-investigation-leak/">leaked internal Intel documents obtained by <em>Igor’s Lab </em>earlier today</a>. Those documents suggest that part of the problem is how Intel’s chips have been erroneously overclocking their own cores, using a feature called Enhanced Thermal Velocity Boost (eTVB), even when they should have known they were running too hot to do that. </p><p>“Root cause is an incorrect value in a microcode algorithm associated with the eTVB feature,” that leaked document began. It continued:</p><div><blockquote><p><em>Failure Analysis (FA) of 13th and 14th Generation K SKU processors indicates a shift in minimum operating voltage on affected processors resulting from cumulative exposure to elevated core voltages. Intel® analysis has determined a confirmed contributing factor for this issue is elevated voltage input to the processor due to previous BIOS settings which allow the processor to operate at turbo frequencies and voltages even while the processor is at a high temperature.&nbsp;Previous generations of Intel® K SKU processors were less sensitive to these type of settings due to lower default operating voltage and frequency.</em></p><p><em>Intel® requests all customers to update BIOS to microcode 0x125 or later by 7/19/2024.</em></p><p><em>This microcode includes an eTVB fix for an issue which may allow the processor to enter a higher performance state even when the processor temperature has exceeded eTVB thresholds</em>.</p></blockquote></div><p>But while Intel confirms eTVB was potentially part of the problem, it’s apparently not the “root cause” of the whole issue. </p><p>Here’s hoping we get a full fix soon. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<section><p>With a 1990s art style and controls, Fear The Spotlight conjures the creepiness of Resident Evil and Silent Hill, but with an emphasis on the puzzles, rather than the combat.</p></section>
        
        
                    
              <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fear-the-spotlight/" data-ref-id="5000-562985">Fear The Spotlight</a> starts like many good horror stories. A couple of friends--nerdy goody-goody Vivian and her goth pal Amy--sneak into school after-hours to perform a séance. The school has a creepy history, after all, thanks to a fire a few years earlier that claimed the lives of several students. It's a bit morbid and disrespectful to try to contact the spirits of a bunch of kids in the school library, but hey, teenagers are morbid and disrespectful.</p><p dir="ltr">I played a short demo of Fear The Spotlight at <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/summer-game-fest-2024/">Summer Game Fest 2024's Play Days event</a>, and at first, that was the thing that stuck with me most--at least, at first. Sneaking through the halls of the school and listening to conversations between protagonist Vivian and Amy, the whole thing felt pretty natural and realistic. Goth kid befriends nerd and the pair get into trouble together--I'm sure a lot of people have that exact backstory in their lives somewhere.</p><p dir="ltr">Fear The Spotlight matches a 1990s teen horror story with a 1990s survival-horror aesthetic. The game calls up the look of early 3D games on the original PlayStation, most notably <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/silent-hill/" data-ref-id="5000-1859">Silent Hill</a>. The blocky, low-resolution visuals work well with the dark high school setting, giving the whole game a strange unreality that's perfect for a ghost story.</p><p dir="ltr">The game, the product of the two-person, husband-and-wife team Cozy Game Pals, released in a previous form back in 2023. It has since been picked up for publishing by Blumhouse Games, the video game arm of movie production studio Blumhouse, and is re-releasing in Fall 2024 with additional story content. But despite having been around for nine or so months, Fear The Spotlight isn't a game I had clocked before Summer Game Fest, and after trying it for a few minutes, I was disappointed I hadn't heard of it before.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4319691-enotria4.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4319691" data-ratio="0.56145833333333" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4319691-enotria4.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4319691"></a><figcaption>The library quickly becomes dark, creepy, and uncanny.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4319691-enotria4.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">The demo started with Vivian and Amy making their way through the halls and heading toward the library. Along the way was a quick stealth segment, in which the girls ducked under a table to avoid the scanning eye of a surveillance camera. That would be the spotlight from the title, with staying in the shadows to avoid being seen being a major gameplay element.</p><p dir="ltr">When we get to the library, we see the other major gameplay element: first-person puzzle-solving. Vivian sets off to retrieve a spirit board (otherwise known as a Ouija board), which is kept in a glass display case in the library. To get it open, Vivian needs a key from the library's office; to get into the office, she needs a keycard. Each time she interacts with one of those elements, the game cuts from a third-person perspective to first-person. You guide a cursor around a static version of the glass case to find the parts you can move or interact with. Touching the display's lock, for example, brings up Vivian's inventory to choose an item to use with it, like a key.</p><p dir="ltr">These interactive moments also give you opportunities to learn more about the world around you. Like in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/resident-evil/" data-ref-id="5000-1727">Resident Evil</a> or Silent Hill, hitting the activation button on any of the other objects in the case brings up a little bit of text about them, giving some of Vivian's internal monologue about whatever she's seeing or reading. Some of these moments are pretty insightful, giving a better sense of Vivian and Amy's relationship. Fear The Spotlight seems to sport a high degree of attention to detail in providing little tidbits that enhance your understanding of the story. For instance, when Vivian retrieves the keycard from the information desk, we discover just how big a nerd Vivian really is--it's her own keycard, because she's one of the library's top student volunteers.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4319692-fearthespotlight_2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4319692" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2176" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4319692-fearthespotlight_2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4319692"></a><figcaption>Puzzles seem like they are usually handled in first-person, where you can interact with objects.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4319692-fearthespotlight_2.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Vivian brings the spirit board to a table where Amy is waiting, where there's another bit of first-person interactivity. When Amy passes you a book of matches, you pull a couple from your inventory and light the candles to start the séance. Placing your cursor over the planchette and holding a button down simulates the way you'd interact with the spirit board in real life, but as Amy starts to ask questions, it starts to move around the board erratically. A dark figure appears behind Amy and the candles go out, plunging the room into pitch darkness.</p><p dir="ltr">From here, Fear The Spotlight takes a drastic turn, even for such a short demo. I relight the candles slowly and painfully, dragging each one from the match box individually. When the light is finally restored, it reveals that Amy is gone. Vivian grabs a candle to light the way, and you can start to walk through the library in search of your lost friend.</p><p dir="ltr">Even in the darkness, it soon becomes clear that the library has changed. First, it's the path back the way you came, with bookshelves turned over to block the way. Then, it starts to seem like the library itself has shifted to become larger and more winding. The space itself feels too big. This is another point when the old-school PlayStation graphics amplify the weirdness of Fear the Spotlight. Checking down one pathway or another, you often see--or think you see--a figure in the darkness. Other times, you're definitely chasing Amy through the stacks, but she somehow disappears in the unnatural space. Although there are a lot of creepy things going on, according to the press materials shared for the game, the spooks you'll get from Fear The Spotlight are atmospheric--no jump scares to worry about here, if those aren't your thing.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4319690-fearthespotlight_3.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4319690" data-ratio="0.56229885057471" data-width="2175" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4319690-fearthespotlight_3.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4319690"></a><figcaption>You will need to sneak behind objects and under tables to avoid being seen.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4319690-fearthespotlight_3.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">As Vivian calls to Amy and continues the search, a distant area of red light appears and a silhouette within it, but as we get close it vanishes, and suddenly, fire spreads through the library.</p><p dir="ltr">At this point, Fear The Spotlight is off the rails. We hurry through the library fleeing the fire, but the room has fully twisted, bookshelves and tables giving way to different walls.

            <p>
Sure, everyone's excited about <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/elden-ring">Elden Ring</a>'s Shadow of the Erdtree DLC, but do you what's <em>more</em> exciting than Elden Ring's Shadow of the Ertree DLC? New hairdos, that's what! And FromSoftware is adding a bunch of them in a free update arriving next Thursday, 20th June.
</p>
<p>
It sounds like a bit of a biggie too, combining a day-one patch for Shadow of the Erdtree with various improvements for the base game. As detailed on Elden Ring's <a href="https://x.com/ELDENRING/status/1801616168299499599">social media feed</a>, it brings bug fixes, balance adjustments, plus a number of new features.
</p>
<p>
With the update installed, for instance, it'll finally be possible to see all your recently acquired items at a glance (previously, new items just vanished into the pile, making it a bit of a pain to figure out what, exactly, you'd just picked up); newly acquired items will be marked with an exclamation mark and a Recent Items tab has been added to the inventory.

<p>
 There are changes to Summoning Pools too; post-update, Active Summoning Pools will carry over to NG+, and it'll be possible to enable or disable individual Summoning Pools in the newly added Map Functions menu. Only active Summoning Pools will be selected when using the Small Golden Effigy, FromSoftware notes.

<p>
 And finally for now, there're five new hairstyles, which can be applied during character creation, when using the Clouded Mirror Stand, or via Rennala's Rebirth feature. And apparently that's not quite everything either; FromSoftware says "other features" will be included in the update when it arrives on 20th June. That, of course, is one day ahead of Shadow of the Erdtree's release on 21st June, and anticipation for its arrival remains sky high. With good reason too, if <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/shadow-of-the-erdtree-brings-further-depth-and-grandeur-to-fromsoftwares-masterpiece">extremely positive early word</a> is anything to go by.

<p id="iTweao"><strong>Genre: </strong>Superhero drama<br><strong>Run time: </strong>1h 57m<br><strong>Directors: </strong>Shannon Tindle, John Aoshima<br><strong>Cast: </strong>Christopher Sean, Gedde Watanabe, Tamlyn Tomita</p>
<p id="IlizaR">Ultraman is back, this time in an all-new animated feature from directors Shannon Tindle (<em>Lost Ollie</em>) and John Aoshima! <em>Ultraman: Rising</em> centers on Ken Sato, a braggadocious baseball player who returns to his home of Tokyo to inherit his father’s role as the superhero Ultraman. After inadvertently adopting a baby kaiju, Ken must raise the newborn while balancing his personal and heroic responsibilities. </p>
<p id="EP2c9z">From our <a href="https://www.polygon.com/e/23942014">review</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p id="GFQRMz"><em>Ultraman: Rising</em> doesn’t spend a whole lot of time on the decades-spanning mythos and world-building around the character. Instead, Tindle and company hone the film’s focus down to Ken’s family dynamic, and his subsequent arc from an obnoxiously selfish braggart to a humbler, more mature hero. That decision absolutely works to the movie’s benefit, allowing audiences who might otherwise be unfamiliar with the character to grasp the broader stakes and particularities of his universe.</p></blockquote>

<p id="TsXe3z"><strong>Genre: </strong>Documentary<br><strong>Run time: </strong>1h 32m<br><strong>Director:</strong> Andrew McCarthy</p>
<p id="0l3i3N">In the ’80s, the young stars of John Hughes’ <em>The Breakfast Club</em> and Joel Schumacher’s <em>St. Elmo’s Fire</em> were dubbed the “Brat Pack” — much to their chagrin. Andrew McCarthy reunites his former co-stars and colleagues to recount what it was like to come to fame in ’80s, how the intense media attention and “Brat Pack” label dogged them throughout their careers, and how they either overcame or succumbed to the pressure of their breakout.</p>

<p id="3lT6Dt"><strong>Genre:</strong> Biographical drama<br><strong>Run time: </strong>2h 21m<br><strong>Director: </strong>Ava DuVernay<br><strong>Cast: </strong>Aunjanue Ellis-Taylor, Jon Bernthal, Vera Farmiga</p>
<p id="CIGxel">Ava DuVernay’s latest film is a drama based on the life of Isabel Wilkerson, the author of the 2020 book<em> Caste: The Origins of Our Discontents</em>. The film follows Wilkerson’s (Aunjanue Ellis-Taylor) journey through Germany, India, and the United States as she researches material for her book.</p>
<p id="4rIt7j">From our <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/24043052/origin-review-ava-duvernay-isabel-wilkerson-caste">review</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p id="pJmaOP">These stories, and the context Wilkerson places them in, are powerful. The almost comical footage of Ellis-Taylor organizing piles of books, writing on a whiteboard, and tapping on a laptop while she ties her case together in voice-over adds nothing but cringe value. It’s easy to imagine a documentary version of <em>Origin</em> that’s more like <em>13th</em>, with the historical reconstructions stitched together by archive footage, talking-head interviews, and biographical information about Wilkerson. It might have been just as compelling, and much more satisfying and coherent. But the takeaway is just the same, and one I intend to act on myself: Go buy a copy of <em>Caste</em> and read it.</p></blockquote>

<p id="J04QsY"><strong>Genre:</strong> Action thriller<br><strong>Run time: </strong>2h 1m<br><strong>Director:</strong> Dev Patel<br><strong>Cast: </strong>Dev Patel, Sharlto Copley, Pitobash</p>
<p id="ARjsIF">Dev Patel stars in his directorial debut as an unnamed street kid who, years after his village was burned to the ground, earns a living as a monkey-masked fighter in an underground boxing club. He embarks on a campaign of brutal violence to exact revenge on the men responsible.</p>
<p id="bwqMBw">From our <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24122067/monkey-man-review-dev-patel">review</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p id="QEFMgk">When <em>Monkey Man</em> finally shifts into gear for its action scenes, there’s a clearer vision at work — though perhaps “clear” isn’t the word for it. Patel, working with fight choreographer Brahim Chab and cinematographer Sharone Meir (<em>Whiplash</em>), shoots the fights up close and personal with a frenetic handheld camera that judders and whip-pans with the force of every blow, and deftly stitches these shots together into head-spinning, unbroken runs of movement. Influenced by <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24112377/best-korean-action-movies-watch-streaming">Korean, Indonesian, and Bollywood action movies</a>, what the style sometimes lacks in clarity it makes up in ferocity and impact. The desperation of Kid’s first bathroom battle with Rana is brilliantly conveyed (Kher is fantastic in an old-school heavy role), and the extended climax is intermittently stunning, although the editing sometimes struggles to maintain focus when things get busy.</p></blockquote>

<p id="sijoDJ"><strong>Genre: </strong>Psychological horror drama<br><strong>Run time: </strong>1h 40m<br><strong>Director: </strong>Jane Schoenbrun<br><strong>Cast: </strong>Justice Smith, Brigette Lundy-Paine, Ian Foreman</p>
<p id="HCYefo">Jane Schoenbrun returns with a follow-up to their 2021 breakout <em>We’re All Going to the World’s Fair</em>. Justice Smith (<em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Honor Among Thieves</em>) stars in <em>I Saw the TV Glow</em> as Owen, a shy student who befriends Maddy (Brigette Lundy-Paine), an older classmate who loves a TV show called <em>The Pink Opaque</em>. As the two grow older, their relationship to one another — as well as the show itself — transforms in ways that neither could have predicted, unearthing uncomfortable truths and revelations that call into question their entire sense of identity. </p>
<p id="3fuR0R">The film’s themes and conclusion have opened up a lot of room for <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24166500/i-saw-the-tv-glow-ending-interpretations-hope-jane-schoenbrun">thoughtful discussion and speculation</a>, and Polygon got to speak to Schoenbrun about <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24158543/i-saw-tv-glow-jane-schoenbrun-interview">the origins of <em>I Saw the TV Glow</em>’s production</a>, as well as how <em>Buffy the Vampire Slayer</em> inspired the film’s in-universe TV series.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gameinformer.com/2024/06/14/yacht-club-games-reveals-new-shovel-knight-updates-including-a-brand-new-game<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Yacht Club Games hosted its own <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ysyNfkYWGW4">Direct-style presentation</a> today, primarily to commemorate the 10th anniversary of Shovel Knight. As such, the event featured various Shovel Knight-related announcements, including the reveal of a brand-new game.</p>

<p>This new Shovel Knight game has no title and was not shown, but Yacht Club confirmed it’s in development. It also hinted that various clues about the nature of this title can be found in other Shovel Knight games, such as Shovel Knight Dig, Shovel Knight Pocket Dungeon, and Shovel Knight: Treasure Trove.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The studio also states, “We're committed to crafting an experience that not only honors the Shovel Knight legacy but also pioneers groundbreaking, innovative gameplay mechanics. This isn't just another sequel - it's a bold new adventure that will launch Shovel Knight into an entirely new dimension of gaming.”</p>

<p>We’ll have to wait to see what this new game is, but the studio did reveal an enhanced version of the original game called Shovel Knight: Shovel of Hope DX. This is essentially the definitive edition of the 2014 indie classic, featuring 20 new playable characters, a rewind function, save states, online multiplayer, cheats, and more. Shovel Knight: Shovel of Hope DX has no release window or announced platforms. As for smaller updates, Yacht Club announced free DLC for<a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/review/shovel-knight-dig/digging-down-in-glory"> Shovel Knight Dig</a> (its final content pack) and Pocket Dungeon.</p>

<p><iframe allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cbpEXPSvFtc" width="640"></iframe></p>

<p>Yacht Club also provided an update for <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2022/02/01/mina-the-hollower-is-shovel-knight-studio-yacht-club-games-next-project">Mina the Hollower</a>, its upcoming action-adventure game. A new trailer offers a montage of gameplay, and Yacht Club states the project is “nearing completion of the initial pass on all level content.” It plans to spend the next few months polishing and refining gameplay. Yacht Club reveals that the game has grown larger than expected since its reveal in 2022; it now features an “expansive” overworld and RPG elements. The studio says to expect a big gameplay reveal in the near future.</p>

<p><iframe allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/b5MbAFiFlOA" width="640"></iframe></p>

<p data-characters="275" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">As the life of <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/tag/helldivers-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Helldivers 2</a></em> goes on, the meta is going to change drastically. Things are going to get better as new enemies (and factions) are introduced. Things will also get worse. As of right now, these are the best weapons after the Viper Commandos patch in <em>Helldivers 2</em>.</p> <p data-characters="93" data-current-count="93" data-injectable="false">This could drastically change as <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/helldivers-2-players-say-patrols-are-still-overbearing-despite-fixes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the whole spawn fix actually made things feel a lot tougher</a>.</p> <h2 id="h-the-best-weapons-in-helldivers-2-after-the-viper-commandos-patch" data-injectable="false">The best weapons in <em>Helldivers 2</em> after the Viper Commandos patch</h2> <p data-characters="266" data-current-count="359" data-injectable="false">The following weapons will be displayed when fighting the current factions. Weapons will only include <strong>Primaries, Secondaries, Throwables, and Support Weapon</strong>s. Typical call-down stratagems like the Eagle 500KG, other air strikes, and turrets will not be on this list.</p> <h3 id="h-smg-72-pummeler" data-injectable="false">SMG-72 Pummeler</h3> <p data-characters="278" data-current-count="637" data-injectable="true">If you need something fast and light, this concussive SMG can do the trick. It won’t clear waves of enemies like other weapons can, but it can soften up mobs and slow them down so you can get a chance to recover or shake them off. It pairs really well with a Ballistic Shield.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <h3 id="h-sg-225ie-breaker-incendiary" data-injectable="false">SG-225IE Breaker Incendiary</h3> <p data-characters="272" data-current-count="572" data-injectable="true">The Incendiary Breaker didn’t get a buff this patch, but it’s really good at clearing out smaller Terminids from close and medium ranges. Weirdly enough, it’s also one of the best weapons to take down Shriekers which have now become part of normal enemy waves.&nbsp;</p>
 <h3 id="h-las-16-sickle" data-injectable="false">LAS-16 Sickle</h3> <p data-characters="206" data-current-count="206" data-injectable="false">The Laser Sickle is probably one of the better assault rifles now in this game because, with proper trigger discipline, you can have infinite ammo. With more small fries to kill, this will be even stronger.</p> <h3 id="h-sg-8p-punisher-plasma" data-injectable="false">SG-8P Punisher Plasma</h3> <p data-characters="209" data-current-count="415" data-injectable="true">The Punisher Plasma gun didn’t get a buff either, but it’s really good at blowing up groups of weaker enemies. Of course, with big risk comes big rewards. Shoot this too close to yourself and you’ll die.</p>
 <h3 id="h-sg-22-bushwhacker" data-injectable="false">SG-22 Bushwhacker</h3> <p data-characters="210" data-current-count="210" data-injectable="false">The new triple-barrel shotgun <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/helldivers-2-all-items-in-viper-commandos-warbond-and-costs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">from the Viper Commandos Warbond is the highlight of the set</a>. Its stopping power is great enough as a deterrent against Stalkers and medium-tier enemies. Don’t sleep on this one.</p> <h3 id="h-p-19-redeemer" data-injectable="false">P-19 Redeemer</h3> <p data-characters="173" data-current-count="383" data-injectable="false">The Redeemer pistol is still the best all-rounder for a sidearm. Whether you’re fighting the bugs or the bots, you can’t go wrong with this. It’ll save you in a pinch.</p> <figure data-current-count="683" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure>
 <h3 id="h-arc-12-blitzer" data-injectable="false">Arc-12 Blitzer</h3> <p data-characters="308" data-current-count="308" data-injectable="false">This gun may not be able to clear waves like other shotguns, but its inherent stun mechanic will be a godsend. The Blitzer can stop a Devastator in its tracks and essentially perma-stun it so that it can’t attack you. Of course, if you have many other enemies surrounding you, this won’t be as effective.</p> <h3 id="h-plas-1-scorcher" data-injectable="false">Plas-1 Scorcher</h3> <p data-characters="275" data-current-count="583" data-injectable="true">Since the R-36 Disruptor isn’t as great as it used to be, the runner-up is now the better pick. A few well-placed shots on enemy weak spots can melt them in seconds. It’s best used against the Automatons as semi-auto rifles aren’t the best in fending off the Terminids.</p>
 <h3 id="h-g-16-impact" data-injectable="false">G-16 Impact</h3> <p data-characters="219" data-current-count="219" data-injectable="false">The Impact grenade is the perfect tool to finish off any heavy that wasn’t killed by a call-down stratagem or ordnance-type weapon. Because it’s also an explosive, it can take care of Fabricators and Terminid hives.</p> <h3 id="h-g-13-incendiary-impact" data-injectable="false">G-13 Incendiary Impact</h3> <p data-characters="229" data-current-count="448" data-injectable="true">The Impact version of the Incendiary grenade is king. No fuse timer makes it exceptionally good at killing mobs of medium and small enemies. Like its normal non-incendiary counterpart, this can also destroy Fabricators and Hives.</p>
 <h3 id="h-flamethrower" data-injectable="false">Flamethrower</h3> <p data-characters="266" data-current-count="266" data-injectable="false">The Flamethrower is almost a must-have at higher-level Terminid missions. It can mow down all the small enemies and even Chargers. With Titans being your only concern, you can save other Stratagem slots to deal with them. Just, be careful not to incinerate yourself.</p> <figure data-current-count="566" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure>
 <h3 id="h-heavy-machine-gun" data-injectable="false">Heavy Machine Gun</h3> <p data-characters="155" data-current-count="155" data-injectable="false">Don’t mind the recoil. If you need stuff to be destroyed, the HMG is it. Yeah, the reloading can be a pain, but the amount of firepower it has is plenty.</p> <h3 id="h-spear" data-injectable="false">Spear</h3> <p data-characters="221" data-current-count="376" data-injectable="false">Gone are the days of the Railgun, but the Spear has now taken its place. With its recent tracking buffs, this thing can take down the biggest heavies in <em>Helldivers 2</em> with ease. Just make sure to keep that backpack on you.</p> <h3 id="h-quasar-cannon" data-injectable="false">Quasar Cannon</h3> <p data-characters="202" data-current-count="578" data-injectable="false">Much like the spear, the Quasar Cannon is something you’ll ideally use just to take down huge enemies in one or two well-placed shots. The cooldown for each shot is 13 seconds, so make each one count.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/schim-is-a-chill-navigation-game-where-you-play-as-a-shadow-hopping-spirit-searching-for-its-lost-human/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=schim-is-a-chill-navigation-game-where-you-play-as-a-shadow-hopping-spirit-searching-for-its-lost-human<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="279" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">The older I’ve gotten, the more I come to appreciate slow-paced games that encourage you to kick back for an hour or so at a time. <em>Coffee Talk</em> and <em>Donut County</em> are among my favorites in this “chill” genre. <em>SCHiM </em>may soon join them if its demo is any indication.</p> <p data-characters="287" data-current-count="287" data-injectable="false">I gave the <em>SCHiM </em>demo a try when I spotted it while perusing the sea of survival crafting games in Steam Next Fest, egged on by the low-key visuals and the promise of a relaxing time. In this hectic life <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/microsofts-recent-layoffs-cast-a-heavy-shadow-over-this-years-xbox-showcase/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">and industry</a>, we can all benefit by giving ourselves an hour to unplug and unwind. </p> <p data-characters="218" data-current-count="505" data-injectable="true">The premise of <em>SCHiM </em>sounds like something out of Studio Ghibli or maybe Pixar. Everything, from living beings to various objects, has a “spirit” called a schim. Losing it is akin to the loss of your soul. </p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <h2 id="h-hop-along" data-injectable="false">Hop along</h2> <p data-characters="405" data-current-count="705" data-injectable="true"><em>SCHiM</em> starts you off teaching you how being a spirit works. Apparently, the rules on losing your schim are a bit fluid, since you can hop out of your host at will and enter other shadows so long as you eventually return. The protagonist schim in question is shown belonging to a young boy, whom you can briefly control while the schim operates in his shadow — as characterized by fantastic googly eyes. </p>
 <p data-characters="232" data-current-count="232" data-injectable="false">Controlling the schim is a breeze. You can manipulate the spirit in various shadows as if swimming in a darkened pool. A single button tap allows you to leap from the shadow, and you make progress by entering another shadow nearby. </p> <p data-characters="365" data-current-count="597" data-injectable="true">The schim can’t survive on illuminated surfaces, but you are given a short “safety hop” to make it to a shadow that was just out of your reach. Don’t worry about dying; you warp back to the nearest shadow if you mess up. You can swap the isometric camera’s angle around when you need to find another shadow just outside of your vision.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Objects found in the world can help you progress. | Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="533" data-current-count="833" data-injectable="true">A single button press lets you interact with some objects, usually as a fun way to see how they react. You can cause a tree to shake or a child to sneeze if you hit the button while in their shadow. The moment I learned you can make bicycle bells jingle, it was over. I had to voraciously jingle every bike chime and make each duck I found quack with reckless abandon. For those desperate to know, <em>yes</em>, you can make ducks quack to the “Shave and a Haircut” jingle. No doubt 90% of everyone who plays the game will try it.</p>
 <h2 id="h-spirit-hopping" data-injectable="false">Spirit hopping</h2> <p data-characters="620" data-current-count="620" data-injectable="true">As suggested, <em>SCHiM </em>does have a story to share. It’s not as subtle as something like, say, <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/unpacking-preview-steam-next-fest-2021/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Unpacking</a></em>, where you connect the delicate threads via the environment and the objects you manipulate. The game begins with you paired with the young boy as you view his life in brief fragments. As a child, he plays without a care in the world. Time passes, and you watch him experience high school, heartache, college, and finally, early adulthood in his very own tiny cubicle in the corner of an office. Things quickly go sour for the young man and, at his lowest, he trips and gets separated from his googly-eyed spirit. </p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="409" data-current-count="709" data-injectable="true">That is pretty much the crux of <em>SCHiM</em>: You’ve been separated from your human host, who is now meandering through the city oblivious to what was lost. Your goal is to give chase, navigating your way from shadow to shadow across levels with various hazards. It feels like an environmental puzzler, as you can find yourself needing to cross a street or get over a bridge by only using shadows to progress. </p>
 <p data-characters="340" data-current-count="340" data-injectable="false">Most times, waiting for a few seconds will solve the issue with a passing human or animal. You can slip into the shadow of a cyclist or a car, which will either speed you closer to your destination if you time it right. Shadows from cars can also grab you and carry you away if you’re caught relaxing a bit too hard in the wrong spot.</p> <p data-characters="447" data-current-count="787" data-injectable="true">But the game isn’t frustrating with its challenges, which is the entire point. Its one-button approach to “solving” the navigational hazards makes moving your shadow frog from one end to another a rather cordial affair. At least, that’s what I picked up from the demo. Based on the game’s description on Steam, it doesn’t sound like <em>SCHiM </em>will ultimately venture into the waters of frustration often, if at all.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <h2 id="h-clean-styles" data-injectable="false">Clean styles</h2> <p data-characters="397" data-current-count="697" data-injectable="true">It helps that the visuals are so crisp. Purposefully monotone, the game juxtaposes one color against a darker variant for texture, creating a look that’s clean and pleasing to the eye. The calming greens of a neighborhood park give way to a busy street punctuated by rain and light-blue hues.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/summer-game-fest-e3-gears-of-war-fable<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Another <a href="https://aftermath.site/tag/summer-game-fest" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Summer (One Week) Of Video Games</a> has come and gone, and while companies like Microsoft brought out the big guns, it remains undeniable that Keigh-3 isn’t quite E3. What happened, though? Why does one showcase of shiny new triple-A games not feel as momentous as the other? On this week’s episode of Aftermath Hours, we discuss that.</p><p>This time around, we’re joined by some guy we know named Ethan Gach to discuss the aftermath (lol) of Summer Game Fest. Ethan was on the ground at the show in LA, so he fields questions about the experience of attending the show in person. We ultimately arrive at the same question people do after every single one of these things: Is an event like Summer Game Fest needed in a digital age where video game companies can spin up showcases whenever they want?&nbsp;</p><p>Then we move on to our favorite games of the show, which consist of <em>Killer Bean</em>, <em>Doom</em>, and probably even a third thing. We also discuss a general feeling of malaise that hung over this year’s show. On one hand, Geoff and associated companies debuted some cool games, but it all felt so… expected. Where once the original <em>Fable </em>pioneered wild new ideas about what a game could be (even if it didn’t entirely stick the landing), the trailer for the latest installment is just a bunch of callbacks. It’s the natural endpoint of an industry obsessed with same-y safeness in pursuit of profit. Finally, we close out on a conversation about sending cats back in time, so you’ll definitely want to stick around for that.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>You can find this week's episode below and on <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/7qtlX6MNeEoyNuHBU0chUJ?si=a2f12b75911f43cb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Spotify</a>, <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/aftermath-hours/id1727407094" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Apple</a>, or wherever else you prefer to listen to podcasts. If you like what you hear, make sure to leave a review so that we can finally give the world the acorn tree-growing simulator Peter Molyneux promised us all those years ago.</p><p>Here’s an excerpt from our conversation:</p><p><strong>Ethan:</strong> It’s funny for me seeing <em>Gears </em>in the showcase, and it being sort of a callback to that nostalgia for the characters and the series, but also what it meant when a new <em>Gears </em>came on the screen and you saw those characters. Versus now, it’s perfectly like what Luke was saying about <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/wolverine-crush" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wolverine looking at the photograph</a>.</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> I guess that was my broader feeling, especially coming away from the Xbox showcase: I remember when a lot of these games and series <em>did </em>mean something. It felt so much more momentous when a new one was announced, or when one was announced at all. I mean, the whole thing about <em>Fable </em>when it was first announced was that it was this legitimate stab at something very new and ambitious. Whereas the new <em>Fable</em>, based on the trailer, feels like it’s just trying to hark back to a thing that we had before.</p><p>I guess that was sort of my bigger issue: Nothing I saw made me feel like ‘Man, those folks are just going for it’ outside a few of the indies. Most of the games just felt like another installment in whatever series. And I’m sure that they’ll be perfectly competently made – or made up to that exacting triple-A standard where each little individual portion of it is polished to a gleaming sheen, but the overall experience is like, yeah, I had a good enough time. Was it particularly memorable? Not really. But that was a fun way to kill 30-some-odd hours. I guess watching a procession of those things kind of leaves me feeling the same way I would after playing one.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Ethan:</strong> I’m trying to think of the other really ascendant franchises right now. Like, when CD Projekt Red is at a showcase, it’s a big deal. Maybe those sorts of things are on their off year right now. They’re out of cycle, and now it’s the bench of players who are aging out and should be just retiring. They’re trying to fill that space.</p><p><strong>Luke: </strong>It’s that wider sort of crisis in not just games, but a lot of cultural stuff, where they’re just so addicted to predictable, bankable IP that when you get to a show like this, it’s quite jarring when you think about how many of these games are just the sixth, eighth, tenth, twelfth entry in a franchise. When you talk about how we used to find E3 more exciting, a lot of those games made their debuts during those older E3s. <em>Assassin’s Creed</em> used to be a new and exciting game series. Now it’s on its god knows what – 15th, 16th game? I don’t know.&nbsp;</p><p>Every franchise that these studios peddle out – whether it’s a direct sequel or you do the Xbox route this year where it’s a sort of rebirth or revisiting of an older series – there’s none of that excitement that, Nathan, you were talking about earlier. There’s none of those groundbreaking, mind-blowing announcements, because you associate those announcements with being a major publisher or platform holder showing off something that’s brand new but is also the centerpiece of their offering for the next year or two.&nbsp;</p><p>PlayStation didn’t get up and show a brand-new, triple-A action adventure series. They played the hits. Even <em>Astro</em>, as cool as it looked, we kind of know it’s cool because we’ve played the demo that came with the PS5. It’s not new. And all the Xbox stuff was… like I said, I like the idea of revisiting old friends, but they’re old friends. There wasn’t much brand new there either. We talked about <em>Doom </em>being the third <em>Doom </em>game. That’s not the third <em>Doom </em>game. It’s, like, the eighth game in a series that’s 35 years old or whatever.&nbsp;</p><p>If anything, that’s what’s really missing. And you don’t even blame Summer Game Fest. You don’t blame individual game studios. It’s just this wider cultural malaise we’re in where all these massive, multinational companies that control our cultural content are just so addicted to the IP and the predictability that comes with IP, because that creates dependable fiscal results. We watch a show like this and get left with this feeling of ‘Eh, that was cool, but it’s not as exciting as the rush you get when it’s a cool new idea.’ A big cool idea from a big company – that’s exciting. It’s left to those indie games to fill that space, which is admirable, but they can’t do it. They fill it to some extent, but it’s just not quite the same spectacle.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Ethan:</strong> And that’s like you saw at the beginning of the Summer Game Fest showcase when Geoff was, in his attempt to sort of acknowledge the weird state of the industry right now, holding up the top ten best sellers on Steam for the year – or maybe the month. But you see the games people have gotten really excited about this year, and they’re emergent games that are out, and either there’s a demo or the full thing is there and your friends are talking about it, whether it’s <em>Hades 2</em> or <em>Helldivers 2</em>.&nbsp;</p><p>I think partly at a lot of these companies, a lot of the money has been sucked up by forever games. It might be boring to see a reveal for a new <em>Apex Legends </em>character or <em>Valorant </em>coming to console, but they don’t need to keep showing stuff for that. They’re not gonna make a sequel. They’re making hundreds of millions per year, potentially. So there’s a black hole. Where before it used to be ‘We need to get a new <em>Gears </em>out every two to three years to make money,’ now that money has all gone to <em>Fortnite</em>, and you’re kinda left with these weird moonshots every once in a while – or just falling back on the old IP stuff. So I think part of it is that the money is not there behind the types of games you used to see at showcases like this.</p><p><strong>Nathan: </strong>Yeah, and on top of that, another price of the many layoffs we’ve had not just this year but also last year and other years – and also various under-the-radar cancellations; you’ll see a sentence in an article that’s like ‘They canceled two or three in-development projects’ – is that you reach a year like this and there’s nothing really, truly new to show. All that stuff got canceled years ago. That is a larger problem. If you’re smothering all your babies in the cradle, then years later, you’re only gonna have the same stuff playing on repeat forever.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
