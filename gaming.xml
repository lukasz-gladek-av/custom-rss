            <link>https://kotaku.com/sony-email-bluepoint-hermen-hulst-studio-closing-why-2000671437</link>
            <guid>1441153</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Sony is shutting Bluepoint Games down <a href="https://kotaku.com/bluepoint-sony-playstation-ps5-god-war-2000671390">just five years after buying it</a>. Hermen Hulst said the decision was the result of an “increasingly challenging industry environment” in a note to staff on Thursday. It’s a shocking end for a studio that Hulst himself admits “delivered exceptional experiences for the PlayStation community” and comes despite a recent jump in profits for Sony’s gaming division.</p> <p>“I wanted to share an update from the Studio Business,” the message, a copy of which was viewed by<em> Kotaku</em>, began. “As I mentioned in the December Town Hall, 2025 had some strong highlights within PlayStation Studios. <em>Ghost of Yotei</em> launched to critical and commercial success, <em>Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</em> further showcased our commitment to narrative excellence, and <em>Helldivers 2</em> and <em>MLB The Show</em> continue to drive on-going player engagement and revenue.”</p>

 <p>It continued:</p> <blockquote><p>At the same time, we’re operating in an increasingly challenging industry environment. Rising development costs, slowed industry growth, changing player behavior, and broader economic headwinds are making it harder to build games sustainably.</p> <p>To navigate this reality, we need to continue adapting and evolving. We’ve taken a close look at our business to ensure we’re delivering today while still well-positioned for the future. As a result, we will be closing Bluepoint Games in March.</p> <p>This decision was not made lightly. Bluepoint is an incredibly talented team and their technical expertise has delivered exceptional experiences for the PlayStation community. I want to thank everyone at Bluepoint for their creativity, craftmanship, and commitment to quality. Where possible, we will work to find opportunities for some impacted employees within our global network of studios.</p> <p>While I know this is hard news to hear, I’m confident in the direction we’re headed. Creativity, innovation, and building unforgettable experiences for players remain at the heart of PlayStation Studios. We have a robust roadmap for FY26, with much to look forward to in the months ahead. Thank you for your hard work and continued support.</p></blockquote> <p>The message will likely <a href="https://kotaku.com/sonys-ps5-era-studio-acquisition-spree-has-been-a-disaster-2000671404">give some fans a feeling of whiplash</a>. It mentions the need for tough cost-cutting before immediately praising Bluepoint’s work. Its most recent games, a PS5 remake of <em>Demon’s Souls</em> and a PS4 remake of <em>Shadow of the Colossus</em>, were both critically acclaimed. Sony reported in 2021 that <em>Demon’s Souls</em> sold 1.4 million copies in the hardware’s launch year.</p> <p>Instead of continuing to have Bluepoint remaster or remake popular classics, a strategy which has proven very lucrative for Capcom with <em>Resident Evil</em> and Bethesda with <em>The Elder Scrolls: Oblivion</em>, the Texas-based studio was put on a live-service spin-off of <em>God of War</em> which ended up being canned in early 2025. The great irony now is that Sony is finally remaking the original <em>God of War</em> trilogy but is about to close the most obvious candidate for the job. Bluepoint was one of the co-development partners on 2022’s <em>God of War Ragnarök</em>.</p>

 <p>And despite larger industry headwinds, Sony recently posted impressive profits. While overall sales across the gaming division were down year-over-year, profits for PlayStation last quarter <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/ghost-of-yotei-outperforms-ghost-of-tsushima-to-bolster-sony-financials">rose 19 percent</a>. It even revised its forecast for the current quarter upwards. Bluepoint is the third recently acquired game studio Sony has shuttered in less than two years.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/visual-concepts/" id="1887">Visual Concepts</a> is spotlighting some of the major changes coming to MyRise in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/games/wwe-2k26-2/" id="174969">WWE 2K26.</a></p>



<p>The latest <a href="https://wwe.2k.com/2k26/ringside-report/myrise/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Ringside Report</a> feature on WWE 2K26 showcased the storyline and changes coming to the MyRise campaign mode. This year’s theme is “The Comeback.” In the story, you take your created wrestler, male or female, on a journey that begins with them returning to WWE, only to lose to Paul Heyman’s current client and top champion, either Bron Breakker or Jordynne Grace.</p>



<p>Then it becomes a story about a real comeback, and players get to choose between a righteous path and a villainous one.</p>







<h2 id="h-paul-heyman-pulls-the-strings-in-myrise-in-wwe-2k26">Paul Heyman Pulls the Strings in MyRise in WWE 2K26</h2>



<p>Paul Heyman narrated a brief video spotlighting MyRise, while the written feature discusses the important changes coming to the mode.</p>



<p>For starters, this year’s game expands on the Live Event Match system with a new structure called RISE Matches. Rather than functioning as bonus content, RISE Matches are now fully integrated into the main progression path. Completing these matches advances your wrestler’s journey and provides rewards.</p>



<p>Also, the story does not end after you capture the main title; there is a new-game-plus mode where you can continue defending the gold.</p>

</p></figure>







<h2 id="h-a-rewarding-journey-with-replay-value">A Rewarding Journey with Replay Value</h2>



<p>As for the aforementioned rewards, there are specific rewards for completing both journeys, including playable characters, MyFACTION content, new weapons, arenas, and more. Some of the rewards shown off include a special golden Bron Breakker, a new attire for “The Fiend” Bray Wyatt, a playable Dusty Rhodes, and 2003 CM Punk.</p>



<p>It was previously reported that the 2003 CM Punk would feature his independent wrestling theme song, AFI’s “Miseria Cantare: The Beginning.” Learn more about that at <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/wwe-2k26-includes-classic-afi-song-for-roh-era-cm-punk/" id="177687">this link.</a></p>

The presentation was led by <strong>Dimitri Weideli</strong>, executive producer, and <strong>Florent Guillaume</strong>, creative director, who walked us through gameplay and then answered some questions.</p>

<h2 id="desperate-mission-wrong">A Desperate Mission Gone Wrong</h2>



<p>Set in <strong>2062</strong>, Aphelion tells the story of astronauts <strong>Ariane Montclair</strong> and <strong>Thomas Cross</strong>, who crash-land on <strong>Persephone</strong>, a newly discovered icy planet at the edge of the Solar System. With <strong>Earth in a catastrophic crisis</strong> due to global warming, humanity had hoped this world could offer salvation, but <strong>the exploratory mission goes wrong from the start</strong>. The game opens right after the crash, with Ariane alone in the wreckage of her upside-down spacecraft, desperately trying to contact her missing companion, Thomas. Right away, let us clear up that <strong>this will be a linear narrative</strong>, not a branching story like Life is Strange.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Aphelion-Parkour.jpg"></a></figure>



<h2 id="active-climbing-partnership-esa">Active Climbing and the Partnership with the ESA</h2>



<p>DON'T NOD revealed that Aphelion's gameplay centers on three pillars: <strong>exploration</strong>, <strong>traversal</strong>, and <strong>stealth</strong>. The climbing system <strong>requires active player input</strong>. Unlike in most other action/adventure games, <strong>ledges don't automatically grab</strong>, forcing players to time their button presses or risk falling. The development team, which shares some members with the folks behind the climbing game <strong>Jusant</strong>, deliberately chose a more accessible yet time-focused approach rather than Jusant's more systemic mechanics.</p>



<p>Ariane is equipped with essential tools for navigating the planet's highly vertical terrain, <strong>including a grappling hook</strong> that allows her to rappel up and down surfaces and even gain momentum to reach distant ledges. The Navigator, a tracking device, helps mark objectives and navigate the environment without cluttering the screen with UI elements. <strong>Persephone itself was described by the developers as the other character in the game</strong>. Its melting ice creates both dangers and new areas to explore.</p>



<p>The developers <strong>worked closely with the ESA (the European Space Agency) to create a believable near-future setting</strong>, basing Persephone on the hypothetical <strong>Planet Nine</strong> scientists are currently searching for in our solar system after noticing unusual patterns in the Kuiper Belt, the region beyond Neptune filled with icy bodies and dwarf planets.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/APHELION-NemesisEncounter.jpg"></a></figure>



<h2 id="nemesis-relentless-hunter">The Nemesis: A Relentless Hunter</h2>



<p>The presentation then moved to the game's second chapter, introducing players to the <strong>one and only living threat: the so-called Nemesis</strong>, a hostile life form native to the planet. This creature, composed of water in its various states (liquid, ice, gas), is <strong>blind but extremely sensitive to vibrations and sound</strong>.</p>



<p>Unlike traditional videogame foes, the Nemesis <strong>cannot be killed</strong> and was designed to be a persistent threat chasing players throughout the entirety of Aphelion. The developers cited Creative Assembly's <strong>Alien: Isolation</strong> as an obvious inspiration while noting their unique twist: while Amanda Ripley had to avoid being seen, the astronauts in this game must avoid being heard.</p>



<p>The creature's presence causes technology to malfunction, and Ariane's flashlight flickers as a warning that danger is near. Early encounters with the Nemesis take place in claustrophobic cave systems designed to feel like a maze, heightening tension as players navigate them in near-darkness.</p>



<p>The game also features stealth sections that require very careful movement, because <strong>sprinting and climbing create noise that attracts the Nemesis to your location</strong>. Players can use the Navigator to track the creature's patrol patterns, though these patterns change dynamically based on player actions. As the game progresses, <strong>the Nemesis gains new abilities, while the players acquire tools such as decoys</strong> to manage subsequent encounters with the life form.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Aphelion-Ice-Cave.jpg"></a></figure>



<h2 id="two-perspectives-linear-story">Two Perspectives, One (Linear) Story</h2>



<p>Aphelion <strong>is composed of 11 chapters</strong>, <strong>each roughly an hour long</strong>, alternating between Ariane and Thomas. While Ariane's gameplay focuses on traversal and stealth encounters with the Nemesis, <strong>Thomas offers a more traditional DON'T NOD narrative experience</strong> (although we had to take the developer's word for it, since it wasn't part of the presentation). Thomas <strong>was injured in the crash</strong>, limiting his physical abilities and making his gameplay more investigation-focused. He also faces unique survival challenges, such as managing oxygen levels. </p>



<p>A key narrative device has the astronauts recording audio logs of their discoveries and feelings. While initially unable to communicate, <strong>the characters will eventually find a "supernatural way" to access each other's logs</strong>, creating an emotional connection despite their physical separation. </p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Aphelion-Pathfinder-Tool.jpg"></a></figure>



<h2 id="accessibility-over-difficulty">Accessibility Over Difficulty</h2>



<p>Rather than traditional difficulty settings, <strong>Aphelion offers extensive accessibility options</strong>. Players can disable manual ledge-grabbing, remove balancing challenges on thin ice, add persistent overlays to highlight climbable surfaces, and adjust measurement-based timing challenges related to the Nemesis encounters.</p>



<p>The developers <strong>emphasized their intention for the game to be challenging yet accessible</strong>, believing that difficulty creates a sense of reward when players learn from mistakes. However, they want to ensure everyone can experience the story regardless of skill level.</p>



<p>Following the <a href="https://wccftech.com/banishers-and-jusant-underperformed-dont-nod-admits/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>underwhelming commercial performance of Banishers: Ghosts of New Eden and Jusant</strong></a> (despite the fact that they're good games, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/banishers-ghosts-of-new-eden-dont-nods-finest-action-game-yet/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">especially Banishers</a>), DON'T NOD is hoping to bounce back. The game certainly looks interesting enough, although we'll have to play it first before we can assess its true value. Aphelion is scheduled to launch this year on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X; <strong>it will be available on Game Pass from day one</strong>.</p>

<hr>



<h2 id="developer-qa">Developer Q&amp;A</h2>



<p><strong>Would you mind telling us more about ESA's work and their inspirations for the game?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Florent Guillaume:</strong> Yes. As you know, we worked with ESA on this project because doing a sci-fi work, especially this type... We're not doing sci-fi fantasy, we're trying to do science fiction in a near future that is a projection of our current world. This planet we're exploring, Persephone, is actually based on what we call a "what if" scenario, because there is currently a search in our solar system for a new planet, a ninth planet. ESA really helped us through our understanding of space and the solar system, how to make this planet believable in our world, and also about our characters. We developed the characters and the technology thanks to them because we're not so far in the future, only about 40 years. They were with us to define this planet, the characters, their gear, and their tools, and to inform the narrative as we crafted the story to really understand the lives of these people and their thoughts and concerns.</p>



<p><b>Are both Ariane and Thomas playable characters in the game?</b></p>



<p><strong>Florent Guillaume:</strong> Yes. The main character is Ariane, the Erin of the game, and Thomas is the psychic of the mission. They have totally different experiences. Ariane's experience is based on exploration, traversal, and stealth-based confrontation with the Nemesis. Thomas is much more narrative-focused, so he has fewer scenes and less game time. His gameplay is more traditional to what we do at DON'T NOD with narrative exploration and development. I can't give too many spoilers about what Thomas finds on the planet, but he'll be investigating the things he discovers to make the plot progress.</p>



<p><strong>Was the crash caused by an accident?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Florent Guillaume:</strong> We skipped the intro cinematic for spoiler reasons, but I can provide some context. Yes, it was an accident, but not a technical one. It was something more mysterious. That's part of the plot you'll understand and discover. In a way, the planet is somewhat responsible for what happens in the crash.</p>



<p><strong>Do Ariane and Thomas have different skills?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Florent Guillaume:</strong> Yes. Ariane is much more engaged in traversal and action. Thomas is much more engaged in understanding and investigating the phenomena and discoveries I cannot discuss today.</p>



<p><strong>Do certain interactions you do in one chapter with one character affect the other?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Florent Guillaume:</strong> That's an interesting question. The game is linear, which means the story moves forward as you go. There's no branching scenes or narrative. The characters are separated, which means you play them at different times. But there are relationships between the scenes and characters, as I said, with the logs they're doing and other stuff linked to the lore of the game. So yes, there are interactions between chapters. Something you do with one character in one chapter will affect the character in another scene, but I can't go deeper into the explanation here.</p>



<p><strong>Dimitri Weideli:</strong> I saw a related question asking if it was like a Life is Strange type game with branching, and no, there is no branching and no multiple endings. There's one story.</p>



<p><strong>Florent Guillaume:</strong> No branching narrative. It's a proper linear adventure story that moves forward.</p>



<p><strong>Is the name of the protagonist inspired by the Ariane space program?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Florent Guillaume:</strong> Yes. Ariane's name comes from the spaceship program. Ariane is a French astronaut coming from Guiana, so her name comes from the rocket family indeed.</p>



<p><strong>Q: How was ESA involved in the development of Aphelion?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Dimitri Weideli:</strong> It's really a partnership. We had discussions with them about all the questions we had about technology and space. They were very open. Their goal was not to make a scientifically accurate video game. It was more like, "If you have questions about space or technology, let's go for it." That was the kind of relationship we had with them.</p>



<p><strong>Will there be more enemies besides the Nemesis?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Florent Guillaume:</strong> As I said, there are no other enemies than the Nemesis, but the way it attacks you and behaves will trigger different gameplay. It's a single enemy always coming back, always chasing you, but the way you play will evolve according to the situation, your behavior, and how it triggers reactions from the Nemesis.</p>



<p><strong>Would you mind giving us more details regarding the inspirations behind the Nemesis?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Florent Guillaume:</strong> That's a good question. The inspiration is pretty broad in terms of science fiction. It ranges from very contemporary modern sci-fi like Interstellar and Arrival to traditional SF like Alien. We can say that Alien is obviously an inspiration, both in terms of lore and games, because we've all played different Alien games, especially the one I think you all have in mind. That was obviously a source of inspiration, though the fact that the Nemesis doesn't see triggers a different way to interact with this kind of alien encounter. It was really interesting for us to play on a different level: not trying not to be seen, but trying not to be heard. That tension was really interesting for us to develop different ways of playing from what we see in traditional games.</p>



<p><strong>Dimitri Weideli:</strong> Regarding the artistic direction: Persephone is an icy planet, so there's a strong connection with water. We wanted an organic enemy made from the planet itself, which is why it has an organic shape.</p>



<p><strong>Florent Guillaume:</strong> The Nemesis is made of ice, basically water in its different forms: water, ice, gas. It can blend into the environment, return to the ice, and pop up anywhere in the world. That's something we're playing with, because you never know where it can come out. There's ice everywhere, after all, and it's made of ice, so it can basically emerge from anywhere.</p>



<p><strong>Are there difficulty levels and accessibility options available for players? in Aphelion</strong></p>



<p><strong>Florent Guillaume:</strong> There are no difficulty levels because we didn't want to categorize players into easy, medium, or hard, making them feel they're not good enough to play this way. We prefer to propose different accessibility options. We try to give accessibility to the different types of gameplay in the game. For example, traversal and the fact that you have to grab the ledge to avoid falling. For players less at ease with timing challenges, they can remove that and make the game more accessible. </p>



<p>With the Nemesis, there are different options to ease the measurement aspects, because the gameplay is very based on measurement. If it's difficult for you to gauge an input, you can remove that and turn some parts of the gameplay more binary. There are different accessibility options, and our goal is for everyone to be able to enjoy the same game and story, with options that allow anyone with any kind of difficulty to still play and access the game. You can also activate or deactivate the balancing. When you saw me walking on a thin layer of ice, you can switch that off, and for all the ledges in the game, you can put an overlay on them that stays on all the time to be sure to see your path.</p>



<p>Regarding the yellow ledges question: our goal was to avoid that as much as possible. In the scene we showed, it's part of the ship, so we tried to make it clear for the player to see the ledges while making it relevant to the situation. In the game's second part, most of the ledges are organic, made of rock, and blend with the environment. No yellow things everywhere: most of the game has more natural elements. If you don't see it, though, we have an accessibility option for you.</p>



<p><strong>What's the balance between cinematics, narrative, and gameplay?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Florent Guillaume:</strong> What we've shown today is pretty early in the game, and some moments are key moments that require more cinematics and narration. The rest of the game has a different ratio. For example, it's about 2 minutes of cinematics per 30 minutes of gameplay. The beginning of the game is more narrative heavy than as you progress. There are more challenges and longer gameplay sessions with action and less narration. The game is pretty balanced—the beginning is more narrative-heavy, but that's pretty classical.</p>



<p><strong>What time span will the story cover?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Florent Guillaume:</strong> Aphelion is pretty tightly packaged. It basically takes place in 24 hours. It's not fully seamless; there are a few ellipses, but it's pretty tight. It doesn't span across weeks or months. Everything in this game is oriented toward the characters and their journey. The time span is very focused on the characters.</p>



<p><strong>Is the character voiced by the same actress as Returnal?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Florent Guillaume:</strong> No, it's not the same actress. We're working with a French actress. Since Arian is French, we cast someone who really fits the role.</p>



<p><strong>Thank you for your time.</strong></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer DON’T NOD has had their hands in a lot of different pies following their work on the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/life-is-strange-remastered-collection" rel="nofollow"><em>Life is Strange</em></a> series. Over the last several years, they’ve dipped their toes into games such as <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/features/tell-me-why-episode-1-impressions" rel="nofollow"><em>Tell Me Why</em></a>, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/lost-records-bloom-rage-tape-1-review-rocking-in-90s" rel="nofollow"><em>Lost Records: Blood and Rage</em></a>.</p><p>Continuing on their self-publishing journey brings us to their latest title: <em>Aphelion</em>, which is a linear sci-fi adventure game promising a big focus on narrative. While <em>Aphelion</em> isn’t out until this Spring, we did get a chance to go hands-on with a preview build to see the kind of new story the team has been working on.</p><p>Taking place in the not-so-distant future, <em>Aphelion</em> introduces us to a fictional world taking place in the year 2060, where Earth has been ravaged by climate change. With the discovery of a 9th planet known as Persephone, both Ariane and Thomas have been tasked with venturing on a scientific mission to survey the planet for future habitability.&nbsp;</p><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/aphelion-escape-the-wreckage.jpg?itok=CK37hO0_ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1920" height="1080">

  </picture><p><br>However, their mission goes awry not long after entering the atmosphere, with their ship crash-landing onto the icy planet and the pair finding themselves separated from each other from the jump. There’s a sense of desperation right out of the gate as the urgency for survival sets in.</p><p>The demo puts us squarely into chapter one, which is a good starting point to get to know one of the dual protagonists. We start with Ariane, whose goal is to make it clear of the ship’s wreckage after waking up and ultimately find what happened to Thomas.</p><p>This is the bulk of the opening chapter, and there’s a level of cinematic feel with the way everything is framed, and also through things like interacting with the environment. Once Ariane opens that initial door, all hell breaks loose, and she’s sliding down the side of the ship, explosions raging, and there’s a struggle to not get caught in the debris.&nbsp;</p><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/aphelion-pathfinder-tool.jpg?itok=lBYLnV2Z 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1920" height="1080">

  </picture><p><br>From there, it’s all about climbing, and it’s here Aphelion feels like it’s taking a page out of the <em>Uncharted</em> playbook a bit. Going vertical is the key, as is jumping across chasms and up ladders. Ariane can scope out the area to determine a possible way out.</p><p>Once that’s settled, Ariane has to keep holding tight as she ascends, taking care with specific button prompts if things get too shaky. There’s a level of tension here because it’s hard to know if anything could go wrong at any moment, especially when some grips can fail.</p><p><em>Aphelion</em> offers up more than climbing on ledges as well. Ariane can make use of a winch (grappling hook) to get up to specific places quickly as she looks for Thomas. It’s a tool that seems like it’s going to get a lot of use as she makes her way through the wreck of the ship.</p><p>As she finally gets through, just as the ship breaks away, the demo takes us to the surface of Persephone, which is a vast, frozen wasteland at first glance. After making some calls, Ariane has to find a viewpoint, and from there, further wreckage awaits.</p><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/aphelion-nemesisencounter.jpg?itok=GpC_OxHR 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1920" height="1080">

  </picture><p><br>The second chapter in <em>Aphelion</em>, which we were able to play, took place further along in the story. Ariane is still on her own, but she’s investigating anomalies called singularities and will eventually confront an antagonistic force called the Nemesis.</p><p>This part of the preview still had many of the climbing and traversal elements from the opening, but with further exploration of the landscape in an area known as the Onyx Forest. Ariane makes her way through an icy cave-like system, and a lot of the gameplay revolves around finding the right path using a Pathfinder tool and avoiding treacherous elements like falling ice and collapsing ledges.</p><p>Deeper into the cave, Ariane can use a light to peer through the darkness, and it’s here where things start to get more closed in and claustrophobic – there’s this sense of being trapped and not knowing how to get out.</p><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/aphelion-ice-cave.jpg?itok=QjXrUSs_ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1920" height="1080">
              <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/aphelion-ice-cave.jpg?itok=3SRj-oKE 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1200" height="675">
                  

  </picture><p><br>It doesn’t take long before this all coalesces into a hidden force – a creature with a red glow of sort begins to launch an attack on Ariane, and it’s going to take a lot of stealthy silence to escape.&nbsp;</p><p>The creature reacts to movement, so the key is to tread slowly and quietly. If she moves too quickly or loudly, the creature will attack, and then it’s game over. There’s a lot of patience involved here, but eventually she can get to the right crevice in the wall and get out.</p><p>Even with just those two sections of gameplay, <em>Aphelion</em> is already shaping up to be something beyond the typical space sci-fi outing. The grounded realism feels more akin to movies like Gravity or Interstellar, so it'll be interesting how far those elements extend - especially with the noted involvement of the real-life European Space Agency.&nbsp;</p><p>While we didn't get to explore the other protagonist, Thomas, the state of his condition, and how that will factor into gameplay, leaves plenty to look forward to when <em>Aphelion</em> launches later this Spring.</p><hr><p><em>TechRaptor was invited to preview <strong>Aphelion</strong> on PC with a code provided by the publisher.

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/interviews/aphelion-interview</link>
            <guid>1441111</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>With DON’T NOD’s latest outing, <em>Aphelion</em>, well on its way to release, we had a chance to sit and chat with the game’s developers <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/aphelion-preview-close-encounters" rel="nofollow">following a brief hands-on play session</a>. Speaking with us today is creative director Florent Guillaume, who gives us some insight on what <em>Aphelion</em> is about and how it uses the sci-fi genre to the strengths of its dual protagonists.</p><p>When approaching a game like <em>Aphelion</em>, which features a science-fiction space setting, we can’t help but be curious as to the why. What sort of design philosophy did the team subscribe to while making the game? And what sparked that particular interest in space and action?</p><p>“After working on <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/features/tell-me-why-episode-1-impressions" rel="nofollow"><em>Tell Me Why</em></a>, which was grounded in a very contemporary setting, we felt the desire to explore new horizons, both narratively and in terms of gameplay,” said Guillaume.</p><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/aphelion-previews-broll.mp4_snapshot_03.03-2026.02.18_22.29.27.jpg?itok=7oO0BJ0v 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1920" height="1080">
              <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/aphelion-previews-broll.mp4_snapshot_03.03-2026.02.18_22.29.27.jpg?itok=6G1p32hT 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1200" height="675">
                  

  </picture><p>“As science fiction fans, our team was eager to craft an epic sci-fi adventure while staying true to DON’T NOD’s core identity: character-driven storytelling centered around intimate human relationships.</p><p>“With <em>Aphelion</em>, our philosophy was to merge large-scale, spectacular science fiction with deeply personal drama. We wanted to place players in a near-future anticipation setting, something believable and grounded, and explore broader gameplay possibilities than our previous titles. Moving into a more action-adventure framework allowed us to explore new forms of tension, traversal, and environmental interaction, while still keeping the emotional journey of our two protagonists at the heart of the experience.”</p><p>Scale seems to be the core theme of <em>Aphelion</em>, and that includes things like the vastness of space, the hostility of the unknown, and the fragile nature of human connection. There's a specific balance between epic and intimate woven into the design philosophy. Building on that philosophy, the team digs into some specific pieces of media such as movies, TV shows, or music that influenced the development of <em>Aphelion</em>.</p><p>“We drew inspiration from a wide range of sources across film, television, and games,” explained Guillaume.</p><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/aphelion-previews-broll.mp4_snapshot_06.26-2026.02.18_22.29.48.jpg?itok=oqteucbe 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1920" height="1080">
              <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/aphelion-previews-broll.mp4_snapshot_06.26-2026.02.18_22.29.48.jpg?itok=_U4DMUeB 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1200" height="675">
                  

  </picture><p>“Films like <em>Interstellar</em> and <em>Arrival</em>, and series such as <em>The Expanse</em>, were important references for their grounded approach to science fiction and their focus on human stakes within vast cosmic settings. On the game side, titles like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/last-of-us-review" rel="nofollow"><em>The Last of Us</em></a> and <em>Alien: Isolation</em> influenced us in different ways — particularly in how tension, survival, and character-driven storytelling can coexist within gameplay.”</p><p>However, that doesn’t mean the team is set on replicating what they’d call “hard science fiction." There’s an effort to create an original universe that’s rooted in a near-future that is very believable.</p><p>“The sci-fi genre is highly competitive and filled with iconic worlds, so for us, singularity came from grounding the story in realism and emotional authenticity. By anchoring the fiction in something plausible and contemporary, we could focus on dramaturgy, character arcs, and the human consequences of extraordinary events."</p><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/aphelion-previews-broll.mp4_snapshot_19.29-2026.02.18_22.30.40.jpg?itok=7YyX_UyT 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1920" height="1080">

  </picture><p>In creating this universe for <em>Aphelion</em>, DON’T NOD reached out to the European Space Agency to collaborate on the project for the dream of a lifetime.</p><p>“Their involvement helped us establish a strong scientific foundation for the project,” Guillaume explained. n“We began with real science, research, hypotheses, and existing theories, and then extrapolated from there to build a compelling work of fiction.</p><p>“For example, Planet Nine, the planet that we explore in the game, is based on a real scientific hypothesis currently being studied. Working with ESA allowed us to approach the setting with credibility and respect for actual space research, even as we shaped it into a dramatic adventure. The goal was not to create a hard sci-fi setting, but rather to build a grounded world that would make the fiction feel plausible in order to enhance immersion and make the epic dimension of the story feel more tangible and emotionally impactful."</p><p><em>Aphelion</em> is a unique case because it features not one, but two protagonists. They won’t play the same, however, as DON’T NOD aims for unique experiences tailored to their unique circumstances. These characters are Ariane and Thomas, the latter of which has been injured in the crash that kicks off the main story.</p><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/aphelion-previews-broll.mp4_snapshot_17.14-2026.02.18_22.30.27.jpg?itok=bg2vfuHW 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1920" height="1080">

  </picture><p>“The two characters are placed in very different circumstances following the crash, and that distinction naturally shaped their gameplay,” said Guillaume. “Ariane is physically capable and in control of her faculties, so her gameplay leans more toward action, traversal, and forward momentum. Thomas, on the other hand, is severely injured. His sequences focus more on survival, investigation, and vulnerability.</p><p>“This alternation serves both gameplay and narrative. Mechanically, it creates rhythm and variety—shifting from intensity to tension, from agency to fragility. Narratively, it reinforces their separation and the emotional stakes of their situation. Experiencing the world through both perspectives deepens the player’s understanding of their bond and the obstacles that divide them.”</p><p>With two different characters we were curious how the gameplay split would go. Does Thomas get more screen time than Ariane? Or vice versa?</p><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/aphelion-previews-broll.mp4_snapshot_19.29-2026.02.18_22.30.40_0.jpg?itok=DI-03MzW 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1920" height="1080">
              <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/aphelion-previews-broll.mp4_snapshot_19.29-2026.02.18_22.30.40_0.jpg?itok=67KlQTPP 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1200" height="675">
                  

  </picture><p>“Roughly 70% of the experience is played as Ariane, who is the primary protagonist of the game. Thomas represents about 30% of the playable time,” said Guillaume.</p><p>“Ariane represents the main story arc, while Thomas’ sequences enrich the narrative structure. The alternation between them is a deliberate storytelling device: They are separated and unable to communicate, the player becoming the invisible link between the two. By controlling both characters, the player holds knowledge that neither of them fully possesses, which strengthens emotional engagement and dramatic tension.”</p><p>That dramatic tension is further emphasized through the fact that <em>Aphelion</em> is a linear action game, but linear does not mean restrictive in the traditional sense. Guillaume said, “The level design alternates between confined, more tightly directed spaces and larger environments that offer multiple paths leading to the same destination.”</p><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/aphelion-previews-broll.mp4_snapshot_04.30-2026.02.18_22.29.41.jpg?itok=QfANNBfu 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1920" height="1080">
              <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/aphelion-previews-broll.mp4_snapshot_04.30-2026.02.18_22.29.41.jpg?itok=MYgHho9r 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1200" height="675">
                  

  </picture><p>“While the overall progression is fixed, players will encounter larger areas that encourage exploration, environmental storytelling, and optional discoveries.&nbsp;</p><p>“One of the main intentions behind the game was the relationship between the characters and the scale of the planet, the immense distances that separate them. So even if we’re not making an open world, we are offering large vistas and explorable spaces that emphasize this sense of isolation and discovery. It reinforces both gameplay and narrative themes, reminding players that they are navigating something far bigger than themselves.”</p><p>So there you have it. <em>Aphelion</em> looks to be leaning big on story, its characters, and the sense of discovery in its own way. There's surely more to discover when it launches later this spring.</p></div><div><p><span><div>

Those of you with good memories might remember that the game ends with the attempted assassination of King Foltest. After killing the would-be assassin, Geralt discovers that the culprit was a fellow witcher. This leads directly into the start of the second game, where we find Geralt locked up for his suspected part in the assassination.</span></p>

  <p><span>Turns out, Ganszyniec had no hand in writing the final cutscene. “The script for this…it was created not really involving the story team. So it was sort of, we weren’t really paying attention. And that was a mistake, I think.” As he explains, this is why the “open question” surrounding Geralt’s future that’s presented in the narrated section, which precedes the animated cutscene doesn’t match up with the conclusion. “Someone decided, like the board decided, or [CD Projekt co-founder] Michał Kiciński decided, that we needed an animated outro of the game.”</span></p> <p><span>This does explain why Geralt has suddenly teleported back to Vizima at the end of the game. The disconnect between Dandelion posing the open-ended question, “What then happened to the witcher?” in the closing narration and an ending cutscene that immediately answers said question also now makes sense, as the writers clearly intended for this to provide setup for something else entirely. On the plus side, Ganszyniec doesn’t seem bitter about the change, as he rounded off his playthrough by voicing his excitement for Fool’s Theory’s upcoming remake of </span><i><span>The Witcher</span></i><span>. “Let’s hope that the remake will be a really good game.”</span></p>

              <p><span>I guess </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/gta-6-grand-theft-auto-vi-delayed-november-rockstar-games-2000641787"><span>in the year </span><i><span>Grand Theft Auto 6 </span></i><span>is coming out</span></a><span>, there are worse days for </span><i><span>Slay the Spire 2</span></i><span>, the long-awaited sequel to the 2019 deckbuilding roguelike, to enter Early Access. But dang, Mega Crit sure picked a packed day to release this early build. The studio announced that </span><i><span>Slay the Spire 2 </span></i><span>will come to Steam on March 5, the same day </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/marathon-free-demo-beta-weekend-server-slam-2000668383"><i><span>Marathon</span></i></a> <span>and </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-pokopia-ghost-pikachu-peakychu-cloud-island-2000669710"><i><span>Pokémon Pokopia</span></i></a> <span>are launching. For a lot of folks, those games might not overlap, but if you’re interested in more than one of them, you’ll have to make some choices about how you spend your day.</span></p> <p><span>The announcement comes with a pretty slick animated trailer showing its various class characters kicking ass, but there’s also a bit of gross fantasy violence in there, so viewer discretion is advised if you’re squeamish.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Check out the trailer below:</span></p>   <p><i><span>Slay the Spire 2</span></i><span> was originally supposed to come to Early Access last year before being </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/slay-the-spire-2-is-now-a-2026-release-but-dont-blame-hornet-2000625257"><span>delayed into March late last year</span></a><span>. The team at Mega Crit said this was due to a combination of personal life disruptions and just a desire to add more to the sequel before it got into player’s hands., though they were also clear that it was not part of the spree of delays that came about as a result of </span><i><span>Hollow Knight: Silksong</span></i><span> finally getting a release date.</span></p>

 <p><span>“There’s no single dramatic reason,” the announcement read. “Some personal life stuff hit the team (everyone’s okay!), we kept saying ‘wouldn’t it be cool if…’ one too many times, and honestly, the game just needs more polish to meet our standards.” Thus another six months development before the game reaches players.”</span></p> <p><span>But the wait is nearly over now. The original </span><i><span>Slay the Spire </span></i><span>launched in 2019 </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/slay-the-spire-is-a-roguelike-card-game-and-im-hooked-1822608254"><span>after its own Early Access period</span></a><span>, and is considered one of the progenitors of the deckbuilding roguelike genre and a major player in its popularity in the years that followed. </span></p>

            <title><![CDATA[Aphelion Preview—A Promising Title With Some Questions]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/aphelion-preview-promising-title-with-questions/</link>
            <guid>1441096</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>There’s a lot to like about Aphelion, especially when it comes to the overall atmosphere and storytelling. The upcoming sci-fi adventure from <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/studios/dontnod-entertainment/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Don’t Nod</a> immediately establishes a strong sense of place and tension, leaning into the studio’s strengths in narrative-driven design. </p>



<p>At the same time, early impressions from a recent hands-on preview highlight where Aphelion still feels rough around the edges, particularly when it comes to its core gameplay. </p>







<h2 id="h-aphelion-preview-a-tense-and-beautiful-world">Aphelion Preview: A Tense And Beautiful World</h2>



<p>The build of the game I played included two playable sections—Chapter 1 and Chapter 4 of the game—both centering on Ariane, one of Aphelion’s two main characters. Visually, Ariane stands out. Her facial animations are detailed and expressive, helping convey the emotions of the situation. There are moments where the lip sync doesn’t fully line up with the dialogue, but the voice acting itself is effective. You can feel the tension in her performance, which goes a long way toward grounding the experience.</p>



<p>Chapter 1, as you’d expect, serves as the game’s introduction. Ariane’s ship has crashed, and she’s trying to make her way to safety while also searching for her crewmate, Thomas. Story details are filled in through voice logs that provide insight into her thoughts and journey. Being able to revisit those logs at any time is a welcome touch as it allows the narrative to unfold naturally without slowing things down.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Aphelion’s environments are one of its strongest elements. The scenery is impressive, particularly when you pause and take in the scale of the world around you. There’s also a noticeable level of environmental reactivity. Move too close to flames, for example, and Ariane visibly reacts to the heat. These moments help sell the world and reinforce the sense of danger. </p>



<p>That immersion is occasionally disrupted by technical issues, including random clipping and minor glitches that pull you out of the moment. However, those are things I’d fully expect to see addressed before the <a href="https://dont-nod.com/en/games/aphelion/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">full release later this year</a>. </p>



<p>In regard to gameplay, well, that’s where Aphelion feels less confident. Much of the preview revolves around climbing, often using conveniently placed ledges that don’t always feel natural within the environment. Nearly every jump also requires a button press to keep Ariane from falling, a mechanic that quickly becomes repetitive. Both chapters also feature balance-focused bridge crossings, reinforcing the sense that the core gameplay loop doesn’t change much between sections.</p>







<figure></figure>



<p>There are attempts to introduce variety. Chapter 1 includes a sliding sequence where Ariane is falling and must avoid obstacles along the way, while Chapter 4 shifts toward stealth. In that later section, you’re required to sneak around an alien creature and avoid being detected, which adds a different kind of tension. These moments help break up the pacing, but they also underline a desire for more meaningful gameplay differentiation across the experience that will hopefully come throughout the other chapters.</p>



<p>The story itself is intriguing, and it’s clear that Aphelion is more interested in its narrative and atmosphere than in mechanical complexity. That approach will work for some players, but the gameplay needs to do more to support the story rather than feel like an obstacle to it. </p>

</ul>



<p>Based on what was played, Aphelion has a strong foundation, but whether it truly comes together will depend on how much the gameplay evolves over the course of the full game. For now, Aphelion feels like a familiar Don’t Nod experience, rich in mood and storytelling, but still searching for the right balance between narrative ambition and engaging play.</p>

Now that's a name I've not heard in a long time. After years of making almost no video games at all, Konami has decided to get back into the fray with a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-playstation-state-of-play-february-2026-everything-announced">handful of new game announcements</a> in beloved franchises. Among the upcoming releases is Castlevania: Belmont’s Curse, a new side-scrolling entry in the long-dormant action-horror series. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Belmont’s Curse is set to release sometime in 2026 for PS5, Nintendo Switch, Xbox, and PC. It’s already available to preorder for $39.99 (<a href="https://zdcs.link/9YRd04?object_uuid=3fb86236-e979-4777-8272-d6ec0f6e60c7&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><strong>see it on Amazon</strong></a>). Below, we dive into what this game is and where you can place your preorder. Let’s get to it.</p><p id="where-to-preorder"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Where to preorder">Preorder Castlevania: Belmont's Curse</h2></p><p id="preorder-bonus"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Preorder bonus?">Preorder Bonus? (Nah)</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">As yet, no preorder bonuses have been announced. If any become available in the future (which does happen from time to time), this is where you’ll find them.</p><p id="what-is-this-game"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="What is this game?">What Is Castlevania: Belmont’s Curse?</h2></p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Castlevania: Belmont’s Curse is the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/castlevania-belmonts-curse-a-new-2d-castlevania-game-announced-sony-state-of-play">first brand-new side-scrolling Castlevania game</a> since 2008’s Order of Ecclesia came out on the Nintendo DS. That’s 18 years! Dang! It’s published by Konami, but it’s being developed by Evil Empire, the company behind <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-rogue-prince-of-persia">The Rogue Prince of Persia</a> and several Dead Cells DLCs, including <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/dead-cells-return-to-castlevania">Dead Cells: Return to Castlevania</a>. So they know their way around a side-scrolling action game. Motion Twin, the main developer of Dead Cells, is also on board in an advisory role.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Belmont’s Curse takes place in 1499 Paris, which is in the midst of a monster invasion. That puts it 23 years after the events of the NES game <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/castlevania-iii-draculas-curse">Castlevania III: Dracula’s Curse</a>. It’s not 100% clear if this is a “metroidvania” or “search action” game in the vein of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/castlevania-symphony-of-the-night">Castlevania: Symphony of the Night</a> and the GBA and Nintendo DS installments of the early 2000s.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In terms of gameplay, it looks like you do plenty of jumping on platforms, swinging from rings, and whipping on enemies. Bosses can tower over you. Environmental hazards like saw blades are strewn about. You have access to additional weapons and abilities like a flame spell and a cross you can throw like a boomerang. It looks like fun.

            <title><![CDATA[Diablo II’s new Warlock is a great excuse to revisit a classic game]]></title>
            <link>https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2026/02/diablo-iis-new-warlock-is-a-great-excuse-to-revisit-a-classic-game/</link>
            <guid>1441081</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
          
          
<p>Of the Warlock’s three Demonic partner options, I found myself leaning most on the Tainted, which can stay out of harm’s way while harassing slower enemies from afar with fireballs. The other Demon options both had their charms but often got too caught up in massive enemy swarms to be as effective as I wanted, I found. I also didn’t see much point in the skill option that let me teleport my demon into a specific fight or sacrifice itself for some splash damage; their standard, AI-controlled attack patterns were usually sufficient.</p>
<p>Then there’s the Chaos upgrade branch, which is focused mostly on area-of-effect (AoE) spells. My build thus far has ended up pretty reliant on the direct-damage AoE options; the Flame Wave, in particular, is especially good for quickly clearing out long, narrow corridors. I also leaned on the Sigil of Lethargy, which effectively slows down some of the more frenetic enemy swarms and gives you some time to gather your attack plan.</p>
<h2>Something borrowed, something blue…</h2>
<p>Combining these Chaos skills with the weapon-improving options in the Eldritch branch has made my time with the <em>Diablo II</em> Warlock feel like a bit of a “best of both worlds” situation. The mixture of ranged combat options, area-of-effect magic, and allies-summoning abilities ends up feeling like a weird cross between a Sorceress, Amazon, and Necromancer, without feeling like a carbon copy of any of those classes.</p>
<figure><p><iframe allow="fullscreen" loading="lazy" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4vKwWWzC5iQ?start=0&amp;wmode=transparent"></iframe></p></figure>
<p>I haven’t yet gotten to the new late-game content in the “Reign of the Warlock” DLC, so I can’t say how well the Warlock holds up in the extreme difficulty of the Terror Zones. I also haven’t experimented with any of the <a href="https://www.tweaktown.com/news/110167/diablo-2s-new-warlock-class-is-so-broken-it-only-needs-a-weapon-and-no-other-gear/index.html">truly broken</a> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/diablo2/comments/1r59840/lets_not_forget_the_other_warlock_builds_are_also/">Warlock builds</a> that some committed high-level min-maxxers have been busy discovering.</p>
<p>As a casual excuse to revisit the world of <em>Diablo II</em>, though, the Warlock class provides just enough of a new twist on some familiar gameplay mechanics to make it worth the trip.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Slay the Spire is a fantastic game, ushering the rise in popularity of both roguelikes and deckbuilders, so it's always exciting to get more news about what developer Mega Crit plans to do with the sequel. While we knew Slay The Spire 2 was slated to release in Early Access sometime next month, a new trailer revealed Mega Crit's plans to drop it on March 5, just two weeks from today. You can take a look at the trailer, which includes animation and new gameplay footage, below.</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PW22jwFNxU8"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PW22jwFNxU8" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>In addition to the release date, Mega Crit also announced Slay the Spire 2 will have a massive feature not included in the predecessor: co-op play. Up to four people will be able to play alongside one another in a new dedicated mode, which features "multiplayer-specific cards" and "powerful team synergies," <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2868840/view/538879349212840702?l=english">according to a recent update to the game's Steam page</a>.</p><p>The trailer also shows off two new characters coming to the Early Access launch (<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2868840/view/577148613051810005?l=english">the Necrobinder</a> and the Regent), and reveals that the Defect, one of the playable characters from the first game, is returning. This means the game's playable roster, which has five characters when you include the Ironclad and the Silent, only excludes the Watcher. That said, given that this is still the Early Access period, there's plenty of time for them to reappear.</p><p>Slay the Spire 2 launches into Early Access on March 5. <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2026/01/27/more-of-the-most-anticipated-games-of-2026-and-beyond">We recently included it in our massive feature on our most anticipated games of 2026</a>, so it's safe to say we're excited about it.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/2026/02/19/slay-the-spire-2-reveals-4-player-co-op-march-early-access-release-date]]></content:encoded>

			<p>After <strong>MegaCrit</strong> missed <a href="https://wccftech.com/slay-the-spire-2-announced-early-access-2025/">its initial 2025 release goal</a> for <strong>Slay the Spire 2</strong>, the beloved indie developer confirmed today that the long-awaited sequel to the popular roguelike deckbuilder will arrive on <strong>March 5, 2026.</strong> Announced during the <strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9fDrSpYlXYI">Indie Fan Fest</a></strong>, its <strong>Early Access</strong> release trailer includes a few sneak peeks at gameplay mixed in between some high-quality animations.</p>



<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/slay-the-spire-2-early-access-release-date-delayed-march-2026-mega-crit/">Back in September 2025</a>, when MegaCrit confirmed that Slay the Spire 2 wouldn't arrive in 2025, it gave a release window that was vague and specific at the same time. The studio confirmed the game would arrive on "<em>a secret Thursday in March</em>." Now we know that Thursday will be the one coming in just two weeks from the time of this writing.</p>



<p>The return to the Spire will include characters old and new, along with new cards, motives, and plenty of secrets to uncover. It'll also feature four-player co-op if you'd rather have some friends along the way while you make the difficult climb up the Spire. The early access release will also include <strong>five playable characters</strong> to start.</p>

<p>"<em>The Spire truly is ever-changing</em>,<em> in more ways than one,</em>" reads a post on the game's Steam page that went live alongside the announcement. "<em>More content - including cards, events, environments, enemies, and more - will be added and balanced throughout Early Access. Join the journey early to be part of the Spire's next evolution</em>."</p>



<p>Pre-orders for the game are not yet live, but you can, of course, add it to your wishlist to stay updated for when those pre-orders go live. Slay the Spire 2 was one of our picks for our <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-most-anticipated-indie-games-of-2026/">Most Anticipated Indie Games of 2026,</a> and it'll be interesting to see how well it matches up to our expectations. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A new Critical Role actual play is coming at the end of this month. This new show, Draw Your Weapons, is in collaboration with Titmouse Animation, the studio behind many beloved and critically acclaimed mature animated shows and features.</p><p>According to an official press release, the <em>Draw Your Weapons</em> actual play will follow a group of adventurers as they venture across the city of Port Promise and beyond on increasingly unhinged quests. The game will be GM'd by <em>The Tonight Show's</em> Josh Knapp and feature players Rashawn Scott (<em>South Side</em>), Sean Glaze (<em>Regular Show</em>), Heather Mahler, and Jason Charles Miller.</p><picture>

  </picture><p>The twist on this actual play comes from the "draw" in the title. As the game progresses, standup comedian Blaine Capatch and Titmouse CEO Chris Prynoski will provide play-by-play commentary, confessional cutaways and live drawing. These drawings will bring the group's worst ideas to life.</p><p>Anything that is drawn like this becomes something the world will have to deal with. This includes monsters, magic items. gadgets, idiotic plans, anything. The result is a show meant to channel "fast, loud DIY/Punk energy." The presser doesn't state what system the game will use, but given the chaotic nature of the premise, just about any system can fit.</p><p>Titmouse Animation has a storied history of making acclaimed animated shows aimed at older audiences.

            <link>https://kotaku.com/sf2-monster-strike-gacha-yoshiki-okamoto-2000671367</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Making games requires testing them. For microtransaction-fueled gacha games, that means putting your own money on the line to sample the merchandise. That’s apparently what led <em>Street Fighter 2</em> producer Yoshiki Okamoto to spend over $500,000 of his own money on his own game’s loot boxes.</p> <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/monster-strike-is-the-free-to-play-conquering-japan-1708368978"><em>Monster Strike</em></a> is one of Japan’s most lucrative gacha games and it’s one Okamoto helped create after leaving Capcom in the early aughts. You shoot monsters into one another to earn points and buy lottery tickets to acquire stronger characters. The mobile hit peaked a few years ago but has brought in over <a href="https://www.pocketgamer.biz/monster-strike-surpasses-11bn-in-11-years-with-japanese-dominance/">$8 billion in lifetime</a> revenue. It almost singlehandedly saved the <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2014/12/29/business/international/monster-strike-gives-former-social-media-giant-mixi-a-second-act.html">social media company Mixi</a> and spawned Nintendo spin-offs and anime adaptations.</p>

 <p>All of which is to say it’s made Okamoto, whose old startup had been failing before that, pretty rich. He recently <a href="https://www.sponichi.co.jp/entertainment/news/2026/02/14/articles/20260214s00041000066000c.html">told Fuji TV</a> (via <em><a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/former-capcom-producer-spends-over-500000-per-account-on-his-own-gacha-games-to-understand-the-feelings-of-high-spenders/">Automaton</a></em>) that <em>Monster Strike</em>‘s unexpected success led him to go from trying to eat on only two dollars a day to making over $7.81 million a year at his new company, Deluxe Games. Prior to that, Okamoto was known for his work at Capcom and Konami, including the arcade shoot ’em up <i>Gun.Smoke</i> that inspired <em>Red Dead Revolver</em>.</p> <p>But a surprising amount of that money was sunk back into his games so he could experience them like a player would. Those include <a href="https://www.dxg.jp/en/game/">newer releases</a> like last year’s <em>Meteor Arena Stars</em> and <em>Outrankers</em>. Okamoto said he does this to understand the feelings of fans who are spending tons of money and to keep the whales satisfied and coming back. Too stingy and they’ll get mad. Too generous and they’ll get bored.</p>

 <p>He suggested in a <a href="https://x.com/shO8KZ6buaRrqq4/status/2023081539199029457?s=20">follow-up post on X</a> that this would be impossible if he just used admin privileges to unlock all the rewards in his games automatically. Yes, sounds terrible. Definitely not something players would ever want. Who wants to play if you can’t pay?</p>

Cygnus Cross showed me that not only is <em>Emberville</em> an incredibly cool idea, but they also have that detail and nuance in overflowing abundance. Their care and commitment to creating something with legacy and quality for their players is what truly makes me excited about <em>Emberville</em>. Oh, and I lied to Doug [Cockle] about him getting sausages to help get the deal across the line… don’t tell him.”</p><p>Previously revealed cast member Doug Cockle added, “The passion, skill, and experience going into the development of this game is phenomenal. I’m always attracted to projects where the team has a clear goal in mind, and the drive and knowledge to reach for it, especially when that goal pushes boundaries. That’s exciting to be part of.

I played at least one game I only half remember of the God of War card game. I was a Kratos main in PlayStation All-stars Battle Royale. I like the guy, is what I'm saying, as a sort of cathartic avatar of the Id taken to its very tragic limits in Greece, and as a clunky conversation starter about guilt and finding power in something other than grievances in Midgard. But I can’t recall ever wondering “I want to know more about pre-Ares Kratos’ teenage years.” And as an answer to a question I would probably never ask, Sons of Sparta is a pleasant character rehabilitation of a largely unlikable guy couched in a largely boring adventure about Kratos learning the value of responsibility.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s also a pretty mediocre metroidvania, clearly taking the form and function of these games but failing to meet the high bar set by the titans of the genre, let alone bringing anything novel to this specific experience. You’ll move through colorful locations, doing the kind of running, jumping, button pressing, object pushing, and monster slaying that will be second nature to your inner Belmont, but you’ll do so at a pace so slow that it makes the journey feel like aimless wandering, fighting through hordes of baddies with combat that tries too hard to be special but ends up crowded and cloying.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I found this young Kratos to be a well-meaning, earnest guy piously (maybe naively so) devoted to the gods and the stubborn defender of his younger brother, Deimos. These are better times for the pair, who have just been granted permission to leave Sparta in order to adventure through and protect the surrounding lands at their own leisure. The well-written banter between them, and the other young people living in the Spartan agoge, reveals the Kratos that could have been, a charismatic, duty-bound leader that is tough when necessary, but also introspective, open to learn, and most jarring of all, funny.</p><p>Combat, for better and worse, was the most reliably compelling thing going on for a lot of the game. Kratos has a lot of offensive options but none that really resemble the God of War’s barbarism.<span><span>“</span></span></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Even the brief moments of pre-Ares pledge adult Kratos in Sons of Sparta, who is telling his daughter the happenings of the game as a fable while she’s grounded, reveal a man who actually has capacity to love his wife and child in the present, and not just be consumed by rage because of their passing. They banter back and forth in the background as notable in-game events go down, and the way Calliope will cast doubt on the seemingly tall tales of her father, or follow up on moments that either seem contradictory or wrong was charming in the way The Prince attempting to recount his journey in The Sands of Time was.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Ultimately, these don’t really save the story from feeling dull and rote. Sons of Sparta is full of interesting characters that you meet after long stretches of not very interesting travel and exploration. The many locations that Kratos and his brother romp through, like the fiery foundry of Daedalus or the dense and spooky Veiled Bog, look good but there’s nothing all that special or memorable about them. A lot of them seem to be begging to tell the story of what got them to the state they're in, like a haunted Winery that is covered in a goop and being possessed by Grecian Ivan Ooze, or a farming village where all of the residents have been replaced by cultists. But Sons is content with just marching you through a place in service of one long goal, to find a missing student of the Agoge, without stopping to elaborate on any of these side stories. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The around 20 hours of my journey was a lot of me wishing I could know more about a cool place I was in, knowing the best I was going to get was a blurb in the lore compendium, checking off every single Metroidvania trope without really any hope of seeing much innovation on the concept. The only “new” idea Sons has about the genre is when the player can expect to gain the signature abilities these games are known for. There's no explicit right or wrong time to gain mechanics, of course, but I went about 10 hours before gaining the ability to drink a healing potion and got a double jump a few hours later, things you might expect to do at the beginning of similar titles. But you spend so much of the early parts of Sons of Sparta running such rudimentary obstacle courses that every time I gained something like the ability to sprint, I felt like I had to wrestle through a fugue state to give it a fair shake. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><span data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><div data-cy="slideshow-preview"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">God Of War Sons of Sparta Screenshots</h3></div></span></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Combat, for better and worse, was the most reliably compelling thing going on for a lot of the game. Kratos has a lot of offensive options but none that really resemble the God of War’s barbarism. Armed with a spear and a shield, you'll mash a single attack string, poking and bashing enemies into submission. Normal attacks cause spirit orbs to float out of your targets, which fill your gauge that can be used to turn your blows into spirit attacks, doing less damage but generating health orbs and significantly more stun meter, which you want to build especially on stronger enemies as a stunned opponent is one that can be executed.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I immediately missed the attack paths of the other series’, that let you mix light and heavy attacks or control tempo with delay strings. Instead, you can equip different spear shafts that change your combo-enders, providing one big damage attack but very few of which stand out from one another outside of this. One adds a Brad Pitt-style leaping spear thrust that gives your combo a little more range, but I didn’t find fussing over the right last hit to be worth much.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Instead, the real effective ways to spice up your damage dealing comes from attaching different spear tips that add passive effects. They unlock active abilities as you upgrade them. Not all spear tips are made equal and there are clear stand outs, like one that extends your reach. The reach-extending one’s active ability made every attack hit twice for a brief period of time. These have a more dramatic effect on your playstyle than the shafts, but I rarely strayed away from this tip as it seemed to clearly be the most versatile. I didn’t find many opportunities to get the most out of some funkier ones like the poison tip or ice tip, which do damage over time and slow enemies, respectively, as they’re effects never gave me a clear enough advantage against tougher enemies that seemed just as dangerous under these conditions.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Pommels can be added to the bottom of the spear to give Kratos another active ability, these being more like special attacks that spend your spirit meter to do. The differences between these were more dramatic - one allows the spartan to deliver a flurry of thrusts in quick succession while another sends him marching, spear swinging in wide arcs around his body. I changed these up the most to adapt to challenges because each felt tailored to handling specific sorts of the threats. </p><span data-cy="poll-view-trigger"></span><p data-cy="paragraph">The most dramatic offensive tools are those that come from the gifts of the god that Kratos and Deimos invite themselves to possess. These operate like spells that, mostly, give Kratos options he can’t get from his spear and shield - namely good ranged options like Apollo’s sling that lets you launch pellets of solid light at foes, or Hestia's shrub whose leaves toss bouncing flames. They also double as keys to specific sorts of locks that litter the vast world of Laconia, Apollo’s light can power specific generators and Hestia’s fire can burn away prickly bushes. But in combat, they are often your strongest and most restricted tool, limited by a magic gauge that can’t be refilled through your attacks like health and spirit can.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There’s quite a lot of ways to attack the enemies of Sparta, many little ways to modify these, and even more ways to grow and change these modifications through the upgrade crafting system. But so few of these options have remarkable gameplay consequences that incentivized me to explore past my early game habits. I didn’t even consider upgrading any of my spear tips past the level required to get their special abilities, and that was only just so I could see them in action. That isn’t to say the combat is easy, per say, but most of your most effective battle plan is to mash attack when able, after getting a safe moment or two to do so.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Enemies can be diligent and lethal, attacking often and in groups, requiring you to get pretty familiar with Kratos’ powerful defensive tools in order to survive. The parry is great for breaking up combos and putting stun damage on a foe, but it isn’t so strong that you autowin the skirmish after a successful swat, like some other games that might reward a good parry with a free execution. You still have to stay locked in, because the enemy will recover quickly to get back to the beating. Dodges, and the handful of follow up attacks that you can nail after, are necessities as well, and mixed together can make getting out of tougher binds feel rewarding. All of these actions can be modified or enhanced through equipment as well - shield rims can make counter attacks stronger or simply raise your armor and make you tougher to take down, for instance.</p><p>Losing in scenarios where multiple enemies might hit you with different kinds of attacks at once always feels like whatever the Greek word is for bullshit.<span><span>“</span></span></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Bad guys get a little too cute with the kinds of offense they can dish out, though. Most action games feature enemies who flash red to denote an unblockable attack, but Sons of Sparta can feature enemies with a whopping four different kinds of special attack conditions, modifying whether an attack can be blocked but not evaded, ones that guard break but can be parried, or ones that you can defend in no way shape or form outside of simply not being around when it happens. This maximalist approach to defensive Simon Says creates too many variables in combat with lots of foes, and losing in scenarios where multiple enemies might hit you with different kinds of attacks at once always feels like whatever the Greek word is for bullshit.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Boss fights turn the screen filling attack machine up to 10, which is definitely a change of pace They don’t start getting tricky until about the last third of the adventure, but those baddies make you earn through extended chains of pattern recognition and reflex checking bullet storms. The easier ones in the earlier in the game can be more disappointing on the difficulty side, but what all bosses share is that they further remove the opportunity to take advantage of many of your offensive tools, since they seem to be largely immune to status effects and don’t have stun bars. </p></section><p><span><div data-cy="verdict"><h3 data-cy="title3">Verdict</h3><p data-cy="article-verdict-paragraph">Sons of Sparta does a lot of good PR for Kratos’ early Greek life, filling in the blanks of he and his brother’s early life in a sort of Young Adult coming-of-age story set in a military highschool. The fresh breeze it gives to the would-be God of War is more of a humid fog when it comes to the actual 20 hour game you have to play in between all of the fun character work. Combat makes the most attempts to differentiate Sons from other contemporary Metroidvanias, but is also mostly bloated with options you never have to even investigate, let alone consider. The rest - the exploration, collectible hunting, platforming - are at best run-of-the-mill, with very few locations and moments within them standing out in this game, let alone among the upper echelon of the best games in the genre.</p></div></span></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/god-of-war-sons-of-sparta-review]]></content:encoded>

Roughly 70 employees are going to be impacted by the closure when it officially occurs next month.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Bluepoint Games is an incredibly talented team and their technical expertise has delivered exceptional experiences for the PlayStation community,” a PlayStation spokesperson told Bloomberg. “We thank them for their passion, creativity and craftmanship."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">According to a <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-01-16/sony-cancels-two-more-playstation-projects" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">previous report by Bloomberg</a>, Bluepoint was working on a live-service God of War game up until January of 2025, when the projet was canceled. The studio then spent last year pitching new projects, but ultimately was shuttered before it could get one moving.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Bluepoint was founded in 2006 by former Retro Studios employees, and proceeded to work on a number of PlayStation games, including several collections of existing games such as the God of War Collection, Metal Gear Solid HD Collection, and Uncharted: The Nathan Drake Collection.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">As <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-go">Pokémon Go</a> announces a seismic shakeup of its Mega Pokémon, IGN has chatted with the smash hit smartphone game's developer on the inspirations for the move, what's changing for the better, and what the future of Mega Pokémon looks like in the game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Today, Niantic announced the addition of a new, tougher Super Mega Raid tier with tougher battle mechanics but better rewards, a fresh currency to engage with Mega and Super Mega raids, and a fourth Mega Evolution tier for your Pokémon to grind for an unlock more bonuses. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Niantic says Super Mega Raids will require upwards of seven players, who are strongly encouraged to bring Mega Pokémon into the fight in order to break shields thrown up by the boss during battle. New and existing Mega Pokémon will feature in Super Mega Raid battles over time, and will reward more Mega Energy once defeated. This will come in handy for levelling your own Mega Pokémon to the new Super Max tier, which provides further boosts and allows you to re-Mega your Pokémon every 24 hours. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Finally, and perhaps most controversially, is the introduction of the new Link Charge currency for Mega and Super Mega Raids. The idea here is that this, like Max Particles, provides a separate method to access in-game content that doesn't just rely on raid passes (though you can still use raid passes for Megas if you choose). How exactly this will be balanced, however, remains to be seen — though Niantic says it will provide better value. Read on for more detail on all of the above in our chat with Pokémon Go's senior producer John Funtanilla.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Hey John, great to chat with you again. Let's start with Super Mega Raids — is the pitch here that they're going to be the equivalent of Gigantamax in terms of difficulty and launch cadence? Will we really need seven or more players as has been indicated?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>John Funtanilla:</strong> Yeah, the mission with Super Mega Raids is similar to Gigantamax and we want to lean into the community play aspect of the game that's gone very well. We want to make sure that we're gathering folks and we have seen a lot of success with that — communities of sometimes hundreds of players in San Francisco going up and down on the piers playing together. That really inspired us and we know that was happening all across the globe. Not to say that there wasn't also some Trainers that also did low count lobbies and were challenging themselves to beat these Gigantamax battles with four or five players. We're very careful with the tuning and we were kind of surprised by that, but we do feel like if you're a really talented player, you understand the systems, you are able to do different strategies that beat these raids. For Super Mega Raids, it's kind of the same thing. We are targeting around a seven to eight player headcount to win, and that's pretty sizable, but again, it's related to how big your communities are, and being able to find the communities. I can go into it a little bit later, but I would say yes, expect same kind of level of difficulty for Gigantamax and there's some mechanics in there that require group play. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Right, there's mention of shield breaking mechanics which sound interesting. I find Gigantamax battles fun because they do require extra strategy, but I know you always have to balance that with the fact your playerbase has a mix of hardcore players and more casual 'Korean grandmas'. You have to fit both those things, to some degree. So, were there any learnings from Gigantamax that you applied here to the new Mega changes?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>John Funtanilla:</strong> Gigantamax was such an ambitious effort. We really wanted to introduce a whole new system. As you know, there's the three Max moves, there's Power Spots. It was a massive, massive effort to finally bring in and actually unlock Gen 8 into the game. For Super Mega Raids, it's kind of an incremental approach. It's a little bit more challenging than normal raids, but other than that it does play using a normal raid battle format. We explored different mechanics and we didn't want to veer away to something that was unfamiliar to players — so we added different iterations on top. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Walking through what this type of battle is, Trainers will need to bring in a Mega Pokémon — it's not required, but we definitely encourage you to bring one in to take down one of those shields. And when we're playtesting internally, people are bringing in Mega Pokémon, and when that last person comes in, there's this big climactic moment where the shields break. There's an amazing visual but not only that, though, there's a huge amount of damage that's done to that boss. And so you get to that powered up form, you're trying to chip away at it, you're yelling at other players to bring in their Mega Pokémon. If they were knocked out, tell them to relobby, heal that Pokémon, bring it back in. We really wanted to lean into that. And that's why I keep saying we wanted community play to be kind of streamlined for this one, it's less tactical than Max Battles but we wanted that excitement, that energy that comes from that moment.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/19/super-mega-raids-key-art-16x9-1771519124281.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Mega Malamar and Mega Victreebel will debut at Pokémon Go Tour. Image credit: Niantic</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Nice, and then just to clarify — could you get into a situation where maybe no one has any Mega Pokémon left, could you still break the shields at that point?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>John Funtanilla:</strong> That can be a state that does happen, maybe one person doesn't have a Mega Pokémon. There are ways that we try to alleviate that. So we've recreated the first time user experience, so this time we put the tutorial right in front of you as soon as you log into the game and that triggers and you'll catch your first Mega Pokémon. You'll understand the utility of it, you'll catch another Pokémon of that species to understand that you get more Mega Energy. So there is an update to this, but we've tried to kind of lift the total tide for the entire feature and include UX improvements. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">I think some of the big reasoning that we gave for actually diving in and improving the Mega system is that we felt that players — looking at the data — weren't engaging with Megas as met as much as we'd seen, especially for something as powerful and with as much utility as they have. That was the biggest thing — improving things all across the board so by the time you get into the Super Mega raid you feel prepared. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">So unfortunately it is a scenario that can happen, but we're hoping that a player realizes that they don't have a Mega Pokémon involved, they back out to the lobby, they come back in and they're going to be that one person that breaks the shield. And I've seen that many times. So I think after players have gone through this a few times, hopefully they'll understand like, 'Oh, I should bring a Mega Pokémon in. I see everyone with their Mega Pokémon and there's toasts and texts that keep saying bring a Mega Pokémon in.' So yeah, we're making it easy for players to have a Mega Pokémon and reminding them to bring it in.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>And a quick one: is the reason the Primals don't count as Megas here lore-related? As they're not technically Megas?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>John Funtanilla:</strong> 100% lore. They're not Mega Pokémon. They have the same kind of power, but The Pokémon Company created the lore which is that technically they're not identified as Mega Pokémon.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Let's discuss Link Charges, which are the third sort-of currency for interacting with battles in Pokémon Go, on top of the existing raid passes and Max Particles. Obviously people love looking at datamined information and drawing their own conclusions, and there's been conversation already around Link Charges potentially offering more activities to do for free but also being another currency to keep track of, and separately work within the limits of. </strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>John Funtanilla:</strong> I saw that reaction from players too. You know how it goes, players will see things with a limited amount of information, but obviously there's still a huge portion of the feature coming out and players are yet to experience it for themselves. I did want to set the perspective on that which is that we had a lot of learnings from Max Particles. So yes, there's the system where you can get a daily free raid pass, there's a system where you can engage with Power Spots and get Max Particles, and then we have Link Charges, which is the new currency. I think the biggest thing here is we want to give players access to premium content. We also want to make sure that we're encouraging and incentivizing engagement into our social features. </p><p>"When you use Link Charges in person, it's actually cheaper than using a battle pass..."<span><span>“</span></span></p><p data-cy="paragraph">We just put out the Weekly Challenges. We have community check-ins, we love the gifting feature. Those are things we want to encourage and we see players engaging with these a lot, but those lead directly towards the Niantic mission. And with Link Charges, for us, these are ways for players to have flexible access to premium content. When you use Link Charges in person, it's actually cheaper than using a battle pass, so there is some kind of discount there. We always want to encourage IRL play and as long as you're doing some of the social actions I mentioned, we reward that effort. And with community check-ins, we understand that's a high value effort action. We reward that, we give you a ton of link charges, you check in, you're good, you're set. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">So you do get a lot of Link Charges and we learned from Max Particles to increase the cap higher. There are some other aspects where we understand that the content is very, very premium and it's difficult to challenge. So with Super Mega Raids, remoting into those does have an added cost of extra Link Charges, and again, it's like a balance that we have to form with the system. With economy, I think it all comes down to flexibility. If you're a player that doesn't want to pay too much, but you love engaging with the game, you love engaging with your community, gifting, things like that, we want to make sure that you have flexible ways to access that content. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Have you nailed down how many Link Charges you can hold at a time, how many you'll need for a Mega Raid (is it just one?), how many you'll need for a Super Mega Raid?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>John Funtanilla:</strong> The tuning will definitely be in different denominations than raid passes. Raid passes is like one for [a specific battle]. Link Charges are again like a currency. We're still tuning it, and that's likely going to be something that we're looking at as we're playtesting it internally, reviewing it with the team. Again, the stance we want to take is that playing in person will be cheaper, and it's going to be cheaper than a battle pass, and it's not going to require a battle pass. That's a fundamental part of the system. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>And I guess the same question on how much it might cost to buy Link Charges in the shop. Can you give an equivalent to buying a raid pass?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">John Funtanilla: It'll be better value, 100%. The final tuning, we're still getting to that, but better value is the main thing that we keep driving here. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/19/link-charges-1771519388676.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption"><strong>Your new Link Charge Holder. Image: Niantic</strong></figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>While we're talking raid passes, something I've come up against in my community is the issue with remote raid passes in Max Battles — where players sometimes fail a battle, can't rejoin, and don't get that remote pass refunded. Max Particles are only consumed when a battle is successful, but remote passes get used up regardless. Are you aware of this, and how will it work with remote battles using Link Charges?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>John Funtanilla:</strong> 100%. I think the biggest way to look at it, is we learned so much from the Max Particle system. We really pushed for Max Particles not being consumed until you win. Raid passes, meanwhile, are applied to the gym or Power Spot when you join the battle and that means until you win, you can keep trying. Max Particles and Link Charges [work similarly], so those will be consumed at the end of the battle once you win. That's a key learning that we wanted to carry forward. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">For remote raid passes, I totally understand and that it might not be as favorable. There is still that leeway again that you can keep trying, though for remote passes you do have to somehow get back into that same gym and that does mean that the player, whoever invited you or if you joined their lobby, they've got to get you back in there. I do think there are some aspects to improve for that, but when we introduce new systems, we're trying to learn from that. We're trying to make it better. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">We're constantly talking with the player experience team for raiders, and they're looking at players trying to understand what problems are coming in. So we see that a lot and we try to build ways to reimburse if there's a crash, things like that. I understand it's not the best system, but we're trying to improve it with everything that we put in the game. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>The timing of these changes happening now feels interesting, because not only do you have the longer-term player behavior around using Megas that you mentioned, but you have the first new Mega Evolutions from Pokémon Legends Z-A coming into the game at Go Tour, with Mega Malamar and Mega Victreebel. Certainly from player behavior I've seen, Megas have felt like one-and-done releases which don't really benefit the community or new players — and it sounds like you've seen data that suggests they're underused too.</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>John Funtanilla:</strong> Yeah... I mentioned earlier the core problem is that from the data we're looking at and player behavior, players are not fully realizing how powerful Megas are. You get that CP stat increase when you Mega Evolve, you can use that in raids, you get boosted ally attacks, you get increased candy. These are things where we only see the most hardcore high level players interacting with it. That's a problem. It's such a great feature. It's in its third or fourth iteration now, and so we wanted to bring that to the game. </p><p>"Players are not fully realizing how powerful Megas are..."<span><span>“</span></span></p><p data-cy="paragraph">And for Super Mega Raids, it's the same thing. Is the utility of your Mega Pokémon worth evolving, worth bringing into Super Mega or original Mega Raids? We want to make sure you feel like your Pokémon are powerful and are meaningful. It didn't matter if it's a 1500CP Mega Beedrill or a crazy Mega Rayquaza. You both are truly important to the battle and you both can take down a shield. That was important for us, we wanted players all across that gradient to feel like they can come in and make an impact on that. And if you can't provide damage like a level 50 player, you're still breaking a shield, you're still helping the community. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Then there's the new Super Max level. This is just a start and I thing I can't really talk too much about right now, but when I say that Pokémon is invested in Megas, we are truly invested in that. We have a roadmap for the year. This is just the beginning of that rollout for players right now. It might not seem like there's a lot, but there's the Super Max level coming out and there's going to be new systems built on top of that. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Part of today's announcement mentions that bonuses vary by Pokémon when Mega Evolving. Is that just due to typing, like a Grass-type Mega gives advantages when catching Grass-type Pokémon? Or will there be specific bonuses for specific Mega Pokémon, almost akin to Adventure Effects?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>John Funtanilla:</strong> You're asking all the right questions. I can't speak to a lot of that right now, we just need to have that space open and it allows us freedom to create different things there. We do have to leave it open-ended because if we want to design something cool and a different Pokémon at that Super Max level is different from another, that's something that we can design. I hope players will enjoy it with Super Max level coming out and understand that there's a much longer runway that we're kind of cooking in the lab right now.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>One thing you have confirmed as forthcoming is the ability to spend Mega Energy to boost up your Mega Level. How are you balancing the cost there versus the lengthy process now?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>John Funtanilla: </strong>Yeah, so to get to Super Max level will be a good chunk of Mega Energy and that's why I do think it'll be important for players to keep raiding that Pokémon and collecting Mega Energy to use it for that sink. For that last level, you won't need to continuously Mega Evolve, it'll just be one sink for you to spend your Mega Energy on. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>And then once there, you can Mega Evolve it every 24 hours without expending Mega Energy, right?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>John Funtanilla:</strong> That's correct. We looked at it, there's not a lot of players that get there. Some players are trying to optimize and Mega Evolve and they have a tag, but for the players that do get there, it's going to be rewarding for sure. So yeah, it is going to be free, you get that cooldown, you can use it again. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/19/gettyimages-2165351181-1771524578593.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Pokémon Go celebrates its 10th anniversay this year.

Are there any learnings there from the release of previous Mega Pokémon? It felt like it was taking a very long time for every Mega to release, and we got to the point last year where most of the remaining few were launched quickly to clear the decks for the Z-A additions. What can people expect the cadence of new Mega Pokémon to be going forward?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>John Funtanilla:</strong> It is crazy to think we've reached the end of the road for the existing Mega Pokémon —</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>You are sat in front of a picture of Mewtwo, so I should point out that people are still waiting there...</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>John Funtanilla:</strong> [laughs] I know, what is this guy doing here? But yeah, the biggest thing there is that we took a look at all the features in the game. Megas were underneath the magnifying glass for us. We were trying to figure out what to do with this. Partly the reason for all of this was that we're were nearing the end of that [initial batch of Mega Pokémon] runway. But also we need to do some really, really exciting stuff this year and need to make sure we have the right foundations for that. For the new Mega Pokémon from Z-A, the DLC, there's such cool things to work with there. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">For Super Mega Raids we can probably kind of map that to how a community might behave. I would like to see, around every one to two months, a big gigantic, Super Mega community raid day. We're still trying to figure out the best thing that works. The biggest thing to anchor it to is how we'd like to see people be able to interact with their communities. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>On Mewtwo, would the 10th anniversary of the game this summer be a fitting time to finally launch its Mega Evolutions?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>John Funtanilla:</strong> We have a lot to show to the players. You're kind of seeing all the foundations for that kind of being put down now and even in the last few years, almost in the shadows... All I can say is that the 10th anniversary for Pokémon Go, the 30th for Pokémon, means you can expect a really, really exciting year.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Image credit: Jakub Porzycki/NurPhoto via Getty Images</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/time-traveling-shooter-time-takers-announces-closed-beta-test</link>
            <guid>1440991</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">Third-person, team-based shooter Time Takers recently announced that a closed beta test will begin on March 13 and shared details about what you can expect from this first look at the game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Time Takers is developed by Mistil Games, published by NCSOFT, and focuses on fast-paced matches where you compete for time itself. It combines elements of survival shooters and battle royales, but it isn’t defined only by kills, it’s about stealing or defending time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Each player has a lifespan that’s fueled by Time Energy, and it gradually depletes. Your lifespan is represented on screen as a timer ticking down. You can hold a maximum of 5 minutes and 30 seconds, and if your timer reaches zero, you’re eliminated. If you’re killed with time still left on your clock, you’ll lose some Time Energy but respawn. You can lengthen your lifespan by earning more Time Energy, which you can get by killing other players, defeating monsters on the field, or picking it up from spawn points around the map.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">When you accumulate Time Energy, it will also fill your level gauge. As you level up, your character’s unique skills will be unlocked and upgraded in a set sequential order. Collecting Time Energy will also grant you a currency called Time Coins, which can be used to purchase or upgrade passive abilities on the respawn screen or at shops scattered across the map. At any time, you can manually sacrifice some of your current lifespan to add to your level gauge and level up. This obviously puts you at risk of dying faster, but it can be key to unlocking an ability you really need. You have to decide which is more important.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Each match progresses through seven phases, and you can see your current phase in the top left corner of the screen. With each phase that passes, Time Energy spawn points get more rare and your lifespan depletes faster. Those spawn points also gradually get closer together, until the final phase has only one spawn in a specific spot.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This system means a couple things. For one, simply camping in one place is unreliable. If you do that, you risk watching your lifespan tick away with no way to replenish it. You have to stay on the move to reach spawn points or take out opponents frequently. Second, the shrinking spawn points force combatants into smaller spaces as phases progress. This also rewards players who pay attention to where the spawn points are in each phase, since you can come up with an optimal route to efficiently gather energy and level up as quickly as possible.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/17/onl-yokogawa-3person-highangle-0159-1771367038314.jpeg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">So in short, you’ll need to decide in each battle how to approach things. Do you want to minimize risk at the beginning, sneaking around the battlefield to gather Time Energy and level up your abilities without directly fighting anyone? Or do you want to go in guns blazing, hunting down opponents to steal their Time Energy as quickly as possible and put them on the defensive immediately?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The first closed beta test will include 12 playable characters, each of whom have unique skills and playstyles. Matches in the closed beta will be in trios, with four teams of three players each, and you’ll need to coordinate with your team. You’ll each lock in your character and weapon before the match, with no duplicates allowed on the same team. Characters are grouped into Damage Dealer, Support, and Tank archetypes, but your choice of weapon can help define your role. For instance, there are support-oriented weapons that allow you to heal, while there are high-DPS weapons for close-range (flamethrowers) and long-range (sniper rifles) combat.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">During the match, if you stay close to your teammates, you’ll form a link. While linked, teammates acquire Time Energy simultaneously and can transfer it between each other to cover for someone whose time is running out. If you want to take advantage of this, it can alter your team’s weapon choices, passive abilities, and tactical approach.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/17/tt-006-1771367110243.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">For example, if someone on your team wants to use a sniper rifle, that can give them a huge advantage if they reach high ground with good sight lines. But they’d likely have to stay separate from their teammates, weakening the link for the whole team. However, equipping the Link Repeater passive will cancel that out and allow you to link up no matter the distance. So unlocking that passive quickly becomes a top priority.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The combatants and battlefields are pulled from different eras of the past and future, and environments and conditions will change as matches progress. Momentum can shift at the drop of a hat, thanks in large part to Pods, which can spawn randomly and grant benefits to the first person to interact with it. Those benefits include temporarily pausing your lifespan depletion, the ability to launch a missile at a specific enemy, or a Weapon Exchange Voucher that will let you switch to a different weapon.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The beta will include three maps: Yokogawa, Morstadt, and Miraesi, which represent the wide range of time periods depicted in Time Takers. Yokogawa is pre-modern Japanese themed and shaped by traditional architecture. Morstadt is based on medieval times, with stone structures and layered routes. And Miraesi is a futuristic setting inspired by Seoul that blends dense urban layouts.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/17/tt-004-1771367204142.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">The closed beta will run from March 13–21, with 8 hours of playable time each day, and it’s focused on players in eight countries: the United States, Canada, Brazil, Argentina, Mexico, Chile, Colombia, and Peru. If you live in one of those countries, you can sign up to join the beta through the game’s <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3596040/Time_Takers/?utm_source=ign&amp;utm_medium=pr&amp;utm_campaign=cbt1&amp;utm_content=feature_article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored"><u>Steam page</u></a>. Sign-ups are open now, and it will still be possible to sign up while the beta is ongoing.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you don’t live in one of those countries, you’ll have a chance to get access to the beta through the Time Takers <a href="https://discord.gg/timetakers" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored"><u>Discord channel</u></a>. If you join the channel and invite a friend to join too, you can be selected to take part in the beta no matter where in the world you are.
