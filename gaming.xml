			<p>What was once a slice of alternative history with a Irish prisoner escaping the Tower of London and becoming an influential samurai in the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/nioh-review-a-samurai-epic-with-souls/">first Nioh title</a> has expanded now into a story of time travel and dual identity. Nioh 3 aims to reinvent the tale that Team Ninja has told over the past eight years with a new time period and setting.</p>



<p>As the grandson of shogun Tokugawa Ieyasu, players assume the role of a samurai whose unique set of skills allows them access to two completely different playstyles. With the Samurai playstyle, players engage in combat like William did in the first game, complete with multiple stances available for each weapon and a Ki Pulse maneuver to regain expended stamina. Playing as a Ninja, on the other hand, removes the stances completely and instead gives the player access to various ninjutsu and ninja tools to approach the combat with surprise attacks and less head-on assaults. Swapping between these two is a simple affair during combat, although I found myself sticking more to the tried-and-true Samurai style because of all of the muscle memory from the two previous Nioh titles. Unfortunately, weapon types are locked between the two combat styles for reasons that Nioh 3 Producer Kohei Shibata mentioned in our interview below.</p>



<p>Much like earlier Nioh titles, enemies are literal fountains of loot with showers of weapons and gear of various rarities that pool forth and litter the screen. New loot filters allow players only to seek out higher rarity tiered items and automatically destroy/sell lower ranked gear that would otherwise clutter their inventory. While this doesn’t solve the issue of a lack of bespoke, unique items, it does at least push the player only to seek out stronger gear that would come with a potentially better roll of abilities.</p>



<p>Nioh 3 doesn’t pull any punches in terms of combat this time around either. Facing the bosses at the end of the Tokyo Game Show demo was an exercise in frustration and learning the intricacies of defensive abilities as Takeda Shingen wails on the player. Despite the challenges, this fight was a fantastic way to immerse players in the combat changes to Nioh 3 and allow them to use every ninja tool in their arsenal to best the boss. If other fights in Nioh 3 can match the intensity of this single fight, I’m looking at another 100-hour obsession when this finally launches on PlayStation 5 and PC next year <a href="https://wccftech.com/nioh-3-launches-february-6-2026-amazon-japan/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on February 6, 2026</a>. We couldn’t get a good peek into the time travel this time around, but that’s something to keep our eyes open for in the months to come.</p>



<p>After getting thoroughly worked by Takeda Shingen's demonic form, we had the pleasure of sitting down with Nioh 3 Producer Kohei Shibata for an intimate 1-on-1 interview, translated by one of Koei Tecmo's in-house interpreters.</p>



<figure><figcaption><em>One of the reasons that we came to the time travel idea for this game is that with Nioh 3, one of the things that I wanted to challenge was having an open field. Basically, the open field was the starting point of how we got to this time-travel idea. The reason behind that is when thinking of ways that we show the open field, we wanted to make sure that players would be able to recognize that there are different areas of the field. One effective way of portraying this is by showing a completely different time period.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Why go with these time periods in Japanese history specifically for Nioh 3?</strong></p>



<p>With Nioh 3, we decided that we wanted to go with the idea of traveling through time. While in the past, we have focused on the Sengoku, or Warring States, Period and focused on major events in that period. Various major characters or historical figures have been included at key points within the story. This time, we wanted to use traversing through time as a key idea, but for the story, we would incorporate the Sengoku Period as well. For the start of the story, it might be better to start with something a little bit different than what people would expect. We decided to, rather than start from a period of war and battles, we wanted to start from a peaceful period, and from there, the protagonist ends up against the wall in terms of being targeted, and this leads to being able to travel through time, so then we can visit the various periods within Japanese history.&nbsp;</p>



<p><strong>When you were creating the first Nioh title with William as the protagonist, did you already have plans for the story to evolve into time travel?</strong></p>



<p>No, it wasn’t something that we had in mind from the first game. We didn’t have this mapped out at all. One of the reasons that we came to the time travel idea for this game is that with Nioh 3, one of the things that I wanted to challenge was having an open field. Basically, the open field was the starting point of how we got to this time-travel idea. The reason behind that is when thinking of ways that we show the open field, we wanted to make sure that players would be able to recognize that there are different areas of the field. One effective way of portraying this is by showing a completely different time period.</p>



<p>We’re using time travel to really showcase the open field element of Nioh 3, so we’ve incorporated that into the story. I guess I gotta say we got a little bit of a hit of this from the DLC for Nioh 2 because one of the DLCs does go through time.</p>



<p><strong>The Nioh series has predominantly been mission-focused, but in titles like Rise of the Ronin, it was largely open world with smaller discrete missions. When transitioning from a mission-based design to an open world, how do you keep that feeling structured and created in a specific way?</strong></p>



<p>One thing when creating this game that we really wanted to make sure that we kept to is that we wanted to make sure that there was freedom and exploration within the field. We wanted to make sure that we had that ability given to the player, but also at the same time, when they pick it up, they’ll instantly realize that Nioh 3 feels like a Nioh game. It’s this dark action RPG, but in terms of how we would portray it, we kept an eye on the density of the fields created and kept that feeling of tension throughout.</p>



<p>Not to say that it was easy, obviously. We went through a lot of trial and error. At one point, we were trying to keep it as an intense action game, but we had just too many enemies on the field. We found that just trying to defeat them gets a little bit tiring. You couldn’t really feel a difference, and it just felt like the same thing over and over again. We decided to formulate it in a way that you’ll encounter areas on the field that have a lot of enemies, but you might encounter a few enemies, but they’re very strong. On the other hand, you’ll also have an area that’s harder to get through. We wanted to make sure that players know there are various ways to progress.</p>



<p>We incorporated a sort of mission, or various strategic ways that you can choose which path you want to go in order to clear the game. We want to make sure that we have that balance in the game as well. In the end, we have given players a lot of different options in how they can explore and get through the various missions, but in the end, when they play it, they’ll definitely feel that this is a Nioh game.</p>



<figure><figcaption><em>At one point, we were trying to keep it as an intense action game, but we had just too many enemies on the field.

On the other hand, you’ll also have an area that’s harder to get through.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Masocore (Masochism Hardcore) has been an identity of the Nioh series. You’ll have veterans who are very comfortable with this type of difficult action, but there will also be new players who are playing Nioh 3 for the first time in the series. How do you balance where you want to challenge veteran players while also making the game accessible for new players?</strong></p>



<p>The first thing I want to say is that the enemies themselves have not become weaker and they’re still very strong. I think that in terms of Nioh 3, in order to defeat those enemies, players will have to reach a level where they can defeat them.</p>



<p>We’ve incorporated elements such as player growth, skill growth, as well as being able to learn the game systems. As players learn the system mechanics, they’ll catch on to how to defeat the enemies. We’ve made sure that it’s easier to learn as you play, so we do have tutorials in Nioh 3. We have onboarding elements as well incorporated into the main structure of the game. Even though the enemies themselves remain powerful, those who are new to the game won’t be able to instantly defeat them but as they play through Nioh 3, they’ll understand the mechanics and ways to defeat them so that it isn’t a frustrating experience.&nbsp; For those who are used to the series, they can get right into Nioh 3.</p>



<p>One of the changes that we’ve done is with the Samurai Style. In previous games, you were instantly given the different stances of High, Mid, and Low. This time, when you start the game off as a Samurai, you’ll start with just the Mid stance so that you can learn the mechanics and get used to it and then learn the other stances so that you’re not instantly overwhelmed. For players who haven’t played in a while, maybe they just need a reminder on how to get into the game. We’ve retained the difficulty level of the Nioh series, but we’ve given players the opportunity to be able to overcome the game and skill up in a fair way.</p>



<p><strong>With Nioh 3 having two different combat styles, I did see that weapon types were segregated between the two styles. Does that mean that the Samurai style will not be able to use the Tonfa or Kusarigama?</strong></p>



<p>Essentially, no, you cannot switch between the two. When we came up with the Ninja and Samurai styles, we also decided on the weapons that would match that image of a Ninja. Up until now, Nioh has only had Samurai in it. This might be more because I’m Japanese and it’s our intrinsic feeling, but it’s about what kind of weapons we would see. The Tonfa and Kusarigama were very common for Ninjas, but we don’t have that image for Samurai or didn’t think that it would be fitting for a Samurai to be able to use those weapons. Even for things like Spears, you know that Samurai would use them, but not a Ninja. But for weapons like the Katana, that’s something that both Samurai and Ninja have used and wield a single, or even double blade. That is one common weapon between the two, but even with the same weapon, the way they use it is quite different. A Samurai might hold the weapon up above their head, whereas Ninjas would hold it behind them in a different style. Even though it’s the same weapon, how they use it is quite distinct but also fitting for that style.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As a veteran Nioh player, I typically play with a Kusarigama in High stance, so with that weapon being limited to the Ninja style, I have to relearn that weapon with a new moveset. I understand, and it was the dev team’s decision to do things like that. We apologize for that, but if you could use a weapon in either style, the distinct elements between the two Styles would be a little bit muddled. We wanted to make sure to keep the two Styles distinct and one of the ways was in the weapon selection.</p>

<p><strong>Onmyo Talismans have been very powerful in previous Nioh titles, and I was wondering if they will still be as powerful in Nioh 3. Will you be rebalancing those, or have players play with less of a focus on that playstyle?</strong></p>



<p>The Talismans are still in and we have made some adjustments. They are overall powerful and we have made some adjustments, but it’s not to the extent that they seem a lot weaker or stronger than in pervious games. One thing that has changed is how you obtain Talismans. In Nioh 3, you obtain them by defeating Yokai.</p>



<p><strong>Nioh games have a lot of equipment you can gather; some say the loot is quantity over quality. When you’re going through a level and you have 20 different Katanas dropping, how do you make it feel like players want to upgrade and look for new equipment?</strong></p>



<p>One thing that we’ve done is make it easier to handle or look at your stock of weapons. One of the new features you can set is that the most powerful weapon in your possession is automatically equipped. We’ve also added a setting so that if something drops and it’s below a certain rarity, you can automatically sell it off or get rid of it. You can immediately tell what is of the most value and what isn’t. It should be easier to get through the quantity.</p>



<p>Another thing that we’ve done with Nioh 3 is because of the two Styles. For example, with the Ninja style and Ninpo, you can find equipment with stronger effects. We’ve given players an incentive to look for these things and equip them to become stronger.</p>



<p><strong>Once you finish Nioh 3, will you unlock a higher difficulty level?</strong></p>



<p>Yes, we have incorporated that into a second playthrough where you can increase the difficulty level and I think that has become a staple for the Nioh series.</p>



<p><strong>Thank you very much for your time.</strong></p>

<p>Doom: The Dark Ages just got a new patch, Update 2.2, and the notes bring up some bug fixes and Steam Deck verification.</p>



<p>Released earlier this year, Doom: The Dark Ages brought the rip and tear of past titles to Medieval times. Reviews called the game a bloody good time, besting the previous Doom Eternal. While it wasn’t <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/doom-the-dark-ages-steam-player-count-is-the-lowest-of-the-reboot-trilogy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">as popular as others</a>, it remains one of 2025’s best shooters. Luckily, there’s more to enjoy thanks to Update 2.2, which releases today.</p>



<p>The patch, releasing on all platforms, aims to fix many bugs and Quality of Life (QoL) issues. Furthermore, Doom: The Dark Ages is now Steam Deck Verified, so the game can be played successfully on the portable console. More additions include adjustments to The Ripatorium and tuning of the Brink of Death system.</p>

Drivers can “race to stop at designated platforms,” and are “scored on their ability to handle their train with precision and control under pressure.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Metro Rivals: New York’s first trailer was revealed as part of IGN Fan Fest and, as you can see in the player at the top of the page, gives a brief glimpse into train racing mechanics. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Metro Rivals: New York Trailer Images</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">According to Dovetail, the game’s narrative sees “players begin their journey with nothing but a hand-me-down train and a determination to rise. To succeed, they must take on a variety of missions, earn cash fares, upgrade their train’s performance, build a loyal following, and earn respect.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While there will be in-game purchases, Dovetail says those are “entirely cosmetic” and that the game is not “pay-to-win.” Instead, players “can express themselves with extensive options to upgrade their train’s performance, apply unique skins and liveries in signature colours, and personalise their character’s appearance to stand out on the tracks.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And if neither the single player campaign nor the PvP mode is your cup of tea, you also have the option to partake in a “more relaxed experience” where “players can set their own paths, hop into their train, and enjoy the sights of the city.”</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/10/11/screenshot-2025-10-11-at-4-46-46-pm-1760216249699.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Metro Rivals: New York will be available on Steam, the Epic Games Store, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S in early 2026. </figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Metro Rivals: New York marks Dovetail’s first use of Unreal Engine 5 in the development process. They also collaborated with the team at Reactional Music to utilize a procedural music engine, meaning that “music is fully native and cinematically integrated in the game, even when swapping tracks.’</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Metro Rivals: New York is being developed for Steam, the Epic Games Store, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S and is available for wishlisting now.</p></section><div><h3 data-cy="object-summary-embed-title">In This Article</h3></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/metro-rivals-new-york-dovetails-new-train-simcade-game-announced-ign-fall-fan-fest-2025]]></content:encoded>

The video’s tone rides a line between Borderlands and Fallout, as the player’s chosen Earth Directorate agent can be seen wielding everything from explosive rocket launchers and melee tools to Spacer’s Choice-branded rifles featuring their lunar mascot, Moon Man.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Each of The Outer Worlds 2’s colorful guns has unique properties that will no doubt aid players on their journey through the space colony of Arcadia. We probably don’t need to explain why a buzzsaw mounted on the end of a staff or wrist-mounted gun might come in handy, but the trailer does a good job of showing off how different weapons can be used. Other highlights from the footage include a lime-green acid gun that melts bodies, alien pistols, and even environmental hazards like a ceiling-mounted turret.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Another star of the new The Outer Worlds 2 trailer is the different factions, which can be found across a variety of locations that look like they were ripped straight out of the all-time great sci-fi stories. It’s a jam-packed teaser ahead of launch, and it’s undeniably Obsidian.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Outer Worlds 2 has a release date of October 29, 2025, for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X | S.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Dan Trachtenberg’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/movies/predator-badlands">Predator: Badlands</a> was inspired by a number of video games. The director has said <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/predator-badlands-director-confirms-death-planet-name-the-new-predators-name-and-reveals-inspiration-from-shadow-of-the-colossus">2005 PlayStation masterpiece Shadow of the Colossus inspired the relationship between the film’s young Predator, called Dek, and Elle Fanning’s character, a Weyland-Yutani synth he must carry around</a>. Now, add World of Warcraft to the mix.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">You wouldn’t think Blizzard’s massively multiplayer fantasy online role-playing game would have much in common with a new Predator movie. But Trachtenberg, who already has Predator films Prey and Killer of Killers under his belt, told IGN at <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/events/fanfest">Fan Fest 2025: Fall Edition</a> that he took inspiration from one class in particular when it came to Dek’s arsenal of weapons.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">How to Watch the Predator Movies in Chronological Order</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“He starts out with a number of really cool gadgets,” Trachtenberg said of Dek’s weaponry. “I’ve always felt like there’s a link between the Predator franchise and James Bond. Part of what we enjoy about going to see it is like, what kind of gizmos does he have? And I’ve been stuck in the past with my entries into the franchise, with Prey set in the 1700s and Killer of Killers set in multiple different decades. But all in the past, so I’ve always had to think, what would his weaponry be if it was a little bit more pre what we’re used to seeing? </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Now I’m well into the future. So he’s got laser bows, has an awesome laser sword that has multiple modes. His sword that he uses, he holds like a classic knight or samurai would, but then it switches it into a different mode and he can use it almost like a glaive.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And it’s the glaive mode of Dek’s new laser sword that was inspired by a weapon in World of Warcraft, which Trachtenberg told us he plays a lot. If you’re familiar with WoW, you’ll know the Demon Hunter class well, and you’ll no doubt have seen its iconic warglaive, perhaps wielded by fan-favorite Demon Hunter Illidan Stormrage.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“In fact the inspiration initially for that was… I play a lot of WoW, and the Demon Hunters glaive weapon was what sparked that,” Trachtenberg confirmed.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In the most recent Predator: Badlands trailer, we see Dek use his laser sword in fights against a number of monsters, the ‘Death Planet’ itself, and other Yautja. But it’s interesting to note Trachtenberg’s words in his interview with IGN: “He starts out with a number of really cool gadgets.” Could Dek end up losing his powerful weaponry, Metroid style, over the course of the movie?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Earlier this month, it emerged that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/predator-badlands-is-confirmed-pg-13-rather-than-r-rated-and-fans-of-the-famously-violent-franchise-certainly-have-opinions-about-that">Predator: Badlands won’t be R-rated</a>. But, its creators hope, it will feel like an R regardless. And last month, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/predator-badlands-director-confirms-theres-no-xenomorph-in-this-movie-so-the-aliens-vs-predator-rematch-is-going-to-have-to-wait"><u>Trachtenberg said fans shouldn’t expect to see a Xenomorph from the Alien franchise in Predator: Badlands</u></a>, despite evil megacorp Weyland-Yutani featuring prominently in the movie’s trailers.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Predator: Badlands hits theaters November 7, 2025.

              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/gog-preservation-program-private-detectives-drm-2000635611">Digital video game storefront Good Old Games</a>, aka GOG, is hosting a massive sales event dedicated to open-world games. Or, well, <em>mostly</em> open-world games. It really depends on how you define what is and isn’t an open-world game.</p> <p>This week, GOG launched a big ol’ sales event featuring some remarkably steep discounts on a variety of games that it classifies as open world. <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/promo/20251015_open_world_promo?order=desc:bestselling&amp;discounted=true#Catalog">The sales event runs until October 25 and features nearly 400 PC games</a>, including some big hits lik<em>e <a href="https://kotaku.com/saint-s-row-the-third-remastered-looks-nice-but-feels-1843608576">The Outer Worlds, Saints Row: The Third,</a> Shadow of Mordor, Sleeping Dogs, </em>and <em>Far Cry 2.&nbsp;</em>All of these games are only available on PC and, like all other games on GOG, don’t feature any DRM. Which is great! This is a good sale. And if all you care about is seeing a list of some of the best and biggest deals I spotted from the sale, scroll past the next paragraph and check that list out. Enjoy it! Happy shopping.</p> <p>Okay, the real sickos are still here. Good. Scrolling through GOG’s list of open-world games made me ponder what is an open-world game. How do you define it? Is <em>Slime Rancher</em> an open-world game, or just a game that features a large map you can freely explore? Do open-world games need side quests? Activities to complete? I think so, but perhaps my definition is too strict? Or maybe trying to categorize every piece of media into various genres and subgenres is silly, and I should stop thinking about this so much? Probably that one.</p> <hr> <ul> <li><strong><em>Deadly Premontion: Director’s Cut</em> </strong>– $1.25 ($25)</li> <li><strong><em>Dropsy</em> </strong>– $1 ($10)</li> <li><strong><em>The Outer Worlds</em> </strong>– $8 ($30)</li> <li><strong><em>Greedfall</em> </strong>– $3 ($35)</li> <li><strong><em>Slime Rancher</em></strong> – $5 ($20)</li> <li><strong><em>Hard West</em> </strong>– $2 ($20)</li> <li><strong><em>Middle-Earth: Shadow of Mordor</em></strong> – $4 ($20)</li> <li><strong><em>Middle-Earth: Shadow of War Definitive Edition</em> </strong>– $6 ($60)</li> <li><strong><em>Rebel Galaxy</em> </strong>– $2 ($20)</li> <li><strong><em>Rebel Galaxy Outlaw</em></strong> – $5 ($30)</li> <li><strong><em>Saints Row 2</em> </strong>– $1.5 ($10)</li> <li><strong><em>Saints Row: The Third Remastered</em> </strong>– $3 ($30)</li> <li><strong><em>Saints Row IV: Re-Elected</em></strong> – 3 ($20)</li> <li><strong><em>Saints Row: Gat out of Hell</em> </strong>– $4 ($15)</li> <li><strong><em>Dungeon Siege Collection </em></strong>(1,2,3) – $5 ($20)</li> <li><strong><em>The Testament of Sherlock Holmes</em> </strong>– $2 ($20)</li> <li><strong><em>LEGO DC Super-Villains Deluxe Edition</em></strong> – $9 ($55)</li> <li><strong><em>Sleeping Dogs: Definitive Edition</em></strong> – $3 ($20)</li> <li><strong><em>American Fugitive</em></strong> – $4 ($20)</li> <li><strong><em>Rustler (Grand Theft Horse)</em></strong> – $5 ($30)</li> <li><strong><em>Brutal Legend</em></strong> – $3 ($15)</li> <li><strong><em>No Man’s Sky</em> </strong>– $24 ($60)</li> <li><strong><em>Far Cry</em></strong> – $3 ($10)</li> <li><strong><em>Far Cry 2</em> </strong>– $3 ($10)</li> <li><strong><em>Two Worlds Epic Edition</em></strong> – $5 ($15)</li> </ul>

<p>Could Sony’s MLB The Show franchise be making its way to PC? Rumors are circulating that the nearly 20-year-old series is set to release on the platform, thanks to a recently discovered job posting.</p>



<p>Sony San Diego Studios is looking for a Senior Graphics PC Programmer to work on a “AAA PC Title”. There are no other details about what this game could be, as the rest of the posting goes into what the role will involve, such as optimizing the game for real-time graphics on the system, as well as optimizing their PC engine. </p>



<p>While the job may be for a different IP, the fact that Sony San Diego hasn’t released a non-MLB title since 2017 has led to many speculating about the future of the series. The last game releases from the studio that wasn’t baseball came in 2017 when both StarBlood Arena and Drawn to Death were launched.</p>



<p>Since then, they’ve primarily been an MLB The Show studio, including releasing the series on Xbox platforms starting in 2021. The game even made its way to the Nintendo Switch in 2022. The latest installment, MLB The Show 25, was released for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and Nintendo Switch.</p>



<p>As far as MLB games available for PC, the last AAA baseball game released for the platform was MLB 2K12 in 2012.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming has reached out to Sony San Diego for comment on the job posting and whether it was for MLB The Show or a new IP coming to PC. Should a response be received, it will be added to this article and shared on social media.</p>

              <p><span>If you missed it the first time, Netflix is bringing </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/kpop-demon-hunters-best-worst-songs-soundtrack-ranking-2000616633"><i><span>KPop Demon Hunters</span></i></a><span>, its animated musical about a group of demon-killing pop stars, back to theaters for a weekend.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>The singalong showings will play in theaters from October 31 to November 2, and unlike the last run, it will be shown at AMC theaters. In a statement to </span><a href="https://deadline.com/2025/10/kpop-demon-hunters-theaters-return-amc-1236587369/"><i><span>Deadline</span></i></a><span>, an AMC representative said, “Netflix, the world’s largest streaming service, and AMC Entertainment, the world’s largest theatre chain, have jointly decided to work together.” Historically, AMC hasn’t played Netflix’s movies, though it made an exception for 2022’s </span><i><span>Glass Onion</span></i><span>. But hey, having </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/kpop-demon-hunters-streaming-box-office-numbers-netflix-2000622381"><span>a cultural phenomenon like </span><i><span>KPop Demon Hunters</span></i></a> <span>do so well in its first run melts even the iciest of cold shoulders. I saw the movie in theaters twice during the previous theatrical run in August, and neither of my crowds </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/kpop-demon-hunters-singalong-box-office-showtimes-songs-2000620026"><span>passed the vibe check</span></a><span>. Those were at the Alamo Drafthouse, which is notorious for its strict etiquette rules, so maybe I’ll go to an AMC showing this time around and find my people who are willing to sing along. That’s how it’s done, done, done, baby.</span></p> <p><span>Since these showings are all happening on Halloween weekend, I fully expect to see moviegoers dressed up as their favorites from Huntr/x and the Saja Boys. Maybe it’s time for me to buy Rumi’s jacket and a purple beanie to do a genderbent cosplay of my bias. It’s only two weeks away, though, so I gotta act fast.</span></p> <p><span>Since its release in June, </span><i><span>KPop Demon Hunters </span></i><span>has gone on to become Netflix’s </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/kpop-demon-hunters-most-popular-netflix-streaming-2000620409"><span>most-popular film of all time</span></a><span>, so it’s not terribly surprising that everyone wants in on this theatrical run. Enjoy it while it lasts, folks. It’s probably gonna be a long time before we see a sequel, but it sounds like a short film might be just around the corner.</span></p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/ballxpit-devolver-kenny-sun-brickbreaker-indie-2000635720</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ballxpit-is-so-much-fun-it%E2%80%99s-eating-up-all-my-free-time-send-help.1325938/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Time travel is real, ya’ll. I’ve experienced it in a few different ways, but the most recent of my trips forward through time, where magically a few hours have just vanished before my eyes, were experienced with a healthy dose of brickbreaker roguelike <i>BallxPit</i> from Kenny Sun &amp; Friends. Its smart reliance on clever angles, interesting build options, and great art design all coalesces to generate the kind of singular, focused attention you feel when staring into a campfire for a long period of time–just imagine you’re in control of that fire, letting it grow in ferocity by chucking balls into it.</p> <p><i>BallxPit</i>’s premise is rather simple: In the fantasy realm of Ballbylon, a massive meteor has dug a hole, or pit, if you will, in the ground where a once-great civilization stood. Now it’s up to you and your cast of funny little heroes to venture into the depths to beat back the encroaching monsters by spitting balls at them.</p>

 <p>That is what it seems is happening. It’s a little gross if you really think about it…so try not to.</p> <p><i>BallxPit</i> fuses together elements of a number of genres, but at its core it’s a brickbreaker (think classics like <i>Breakout </i>and <i>Arkanoid</i>) in which you march toward advancing enemies, firing a variety of projectiles to wipe them out. Each map I’ve played thus far also includes two mini-bosses and one main boss, who introduce some bullet hell scenarios for you to survive.</p>

 <p>As I mentioned earlier, you fight back by spitting balls at the enemy hordes. For the most part these balls come in two basic types: baby balls and more powerful balls on which different status effects can be stacked, combined for greater effect, and evolved into more powerful versions of themselves. Once a ball is in play, it will bounce around the level, hitting walls or monsters. Once it comes back to your character, you can spit it back out to start the process all over again.</p>

 <p>You can use up to four different main balls at any given time. You’ll have the chance to earn one each time you level up by collecting enough gems from fallen enemies, and you can level up these balls up to three times. Fusion pickups, meanwhile, let you sometimes combine balls to merge their effects, thereby opening up a new slot so you can acquire a new ball. I’m still unlocking new balls, but one of my favorites so far is Laser, which comes in a horizontal or vertical variety and nails multiple enemies with a satisfying beam of death. It’s perfect for crowd control. Freeze is another handy ball which, as you might expect, will freeze enemies for a specific amount of time relative to its level. As you play, you can snag a “Fusion” pickup to combine these into a “Freeze Ray” which includes both freezing and the lane- or column-spanning laser. Another great combo is one that fuses the earthquake ball and poison ball, allowing you to poison multiple enemies in an AOE attack. There are a ton of different combinations like these and given the randomness of the roguelike genre elements, if you’re not building your way to a setup you already know and rely on, then you’re instead likely to hit upon some new and surprising ways to combine powers. It’s a satisfying buildcrafting experience.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000635731" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000635731"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000635731">© Screenshot: Kenny Sun &amp; Friends / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>Accompanying these balls are up to four passive abilities which can do everything from increasing your damage from specific angles to speeding up your movement or upping your defenses.</p> <p>It all combines for a very satisfying, though challenging, game loop that only becomes more irresistible as your destructive capacity grows. And though it may look wildly chaotic at times, blasting through the game’s hordes of satisfyingly animated enemies isn’t just a mindless march forward through pixely carnage; while my first few hours were spent just jumping into the fray to see what happened, the ways you can combine different powers and use angles to bounce balls deep into the enemies’ ranks encourage you to play smart to be sure you melt them before they reach you. But if you’re often overwhelmed when games hoist multiple coexisting systems upon you at once, relax; <i>BallxPit</i> lets you jump in without much homework, and you can pick up the basics of what each ball does in real time.</p>

 <p>Making things all the more engaging, you’re regularly increasing in power as you play. Defeated enemies will drop anything from resources for your base to fusion powerups that let you level up or combine more powerful balls, as well as healing potions (they’re very rare, though) and gems, which will steadily increase your level meter. And you’ll level up fast. If you enjoy a rapid progression in power, well, <i>BallxPit</i> is quick to give it to you. Enemies drop so many gems that you’ll quickly ascend in levels. Hit a new level and you’ll get a choice of three possible powerups, either a new ball or a passive (once you’ve leveled up all your balls and passives, you’ll just choose one of three resources for your home base). Just blindly grabbing a new ball or passive ability won’t always work if you don’t take a beat to figure out what kind of build you’re going for. Are you combining balls to up your AOE attacks? Are you investing in upping your speed output? The random, roguelike features of the game ensure that you probably won’t fall into too many predictable builds, but over time you’ll start finding patterns you prefer.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000635733" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000635733"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000635733">© Screenshot: Kenny Sun &amp; Friends / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>There’s also a whole farming management sim built into the game as well. I haven’t spent as much time building my base as it seems the game wants me to (the brick-breaking portion is very hard to put down). But every time you complete a run, you can choose to back to your base which, at first, looks similar to your home in other farming sims: You’ll put down plots of land with farmable resources, build housing units for your characters, and send your characters out to gather wood, rocks, and wheat.</p> <p>But it’s the way you lay out and farm for resources that makes all the difference. True to its form as a brickbreaker that has you firing balls of destructive energy at your enemies, <i>BallxPit </i>turns farming into a situation where angles really matter. Your characters will sprint around your base for a certain period of time, colliding with various plots of land to mine the resources in each tile. So as you determine your base’s layout, you want to create one that maximizes your harvest based on the angles at which your characters bounce.</p> <p>Your resources grow back pretty fast, too. So every time you finish a run in the pit, you can usually come back to your base to start farming with the potential for a decent harvest. Though I’ve yet to enjoy the untapped potential of setting up an efficient, well-designed base for my characters to bounce off of and farm, this complementary game mechanic helps <i>BallxPit </i>avoid a sense of redundancy that might otherwise have set in if there was nothing breaking up the ball-spitting, brickbreaking action. I always feel like there’s something new to do, whether that’s sending a new character down to polish off a previously finished map, returning to base to farm resources, unlocking a new character by building a new housing unit, or continuing to expand and grow my base.</p> <p><i>BallxPit</i> has been a wonderful time in my half-a-dozen or so hours with it, and has become an easy go-to option when picking up my Steam Deck without a clear game in mind to play. The diversity of build options helps keep runs feeling very fresh, and I’m still discovering new ways to plow through hordes of enemies, whether that be cool new builds or a fun way to exploit various angles that I hadn’t considered before. I don’t think watching balls rapidly bounce all over the place while enemies perish in various ways and damage numbers satisfyingly pop up over their heads will&nbsp; get old anytime soon.</p>

                <p>In September 2001, Fumito Ueda's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/ico/" data-ref-id="5000-2864">Ico</a> was released on PlayStation 2, and it made quite an impression on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-last-of-us/" data-ref-id="5000-125470">The Last of Us</a> co-creator and director Neil Druckmann. Even 25 years after the game's release, Druckmann still points to a scene late in Ico as his favorite moment in a video game. There are some spoilers ahead for this quarter-century-old game.</p><p>"My favorite moment in a game. the one that's made my jaw drop when it when it happened, is in the game Ico," Druckmann told <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZOQxseKQv0" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BAFTA</a> in a recent interview. "We talked about how there's this mechanic where you're holding Yorda's hand and you're leading her along ... and she feels like this helpless character that you're leading along."</p><p>"Then there's a moment towards the end of the game, where you're on this bridge that is slowly like, splitting apart and Yorda is on one side of it and you're on the other, and you don't know what to do," continued Druckmann. "All you can do is just sprint towards that gap and jump towards her, and it looks like you're not going to make it and you're going to fall to your death. In the last second she reaches out and she grabs you. It was such an emotional moment because you don't expect it. She's never done that at any other point in the game."</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZOQxseKQv0" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/QZOQxseKQv0" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Druckmann went on to say it was a truly inspirational moment and he felt that the handholding mechanic had made him care about Yorda like no other game character beforehand.</p><p>"I got this twist and this evolution of this character and this relationship that I don't know how you don't get emotional playing that part. I think I've been chasing that feeling with every game I've made ever since."</p><p>Druckmann previously praised Ico during <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/top-game-designers-pay-tribute-to-ico-on-its-20th-anniversary-in-japan/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">the title's 20th anniversary</a>, and he called it his favorite game of all time.</p><p>Until earlier this year, Druckmann was the co-showrunner of HBO's The Last of Us. However, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-last-of-us-game-co-creator-neil-druckmann-steps-down-from-the-hit-hbo-series/1100-6532923/" data-ref-id="1100-6532923">he stepped down from that role</a> at the end of Season 2 to return his focus to game development. His next project is Naughty Dog's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet/">Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet</a>, which will be a PlayStation console exclusive.

            <link>https://wccftech.com/new-report-points-to-mandated-crunch-at-mercurysteam-metroid-dread-blades-of-fire/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/new-report-points-to-mandated-crunch-at-metroid-dread-and-blades-of-fire-studio-mercurysteam.1325926/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>A new report from <a href="https://www.3djuegos.com/juegos/blades-of-fire/noticias/trabajadores-mercurysteam-algo-hace-bien-mercury-jugar-miedo-porque-no-hay-otro-lugar-donde-ir-industria">Spanish publication 3DJuegos</a> points to poor working conditions at MercurySteam, the studio behind Metroid Dread, and more recently, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/blades-of-fire-review-god-of-the-forge/">Blades of Fire, which launched earlier this year</a>. The report includes interviews with both current and former members of MercurySteam's development team, who claim that the studio was mandating overtime that should have been voluntary, and that a crunch culture has been established where an eight-hour-a-day work week is an easy week compared to the new 10-hour normal.</p>



<p>According to the report, these issues began before the launch of Blades of Fire, with a new work schedule implemented called "<em></em><em>Distribucion Irregular de la Jornada</em> <em>(DIJ)</em>," which essentially meant teams within MercurySteam would be subjected to longer hours, but the overtime compensation was never directly made clear. It was also never actually mandatory, with the company's HR department admitting, after employees poked holes in the new system's implementation, that these hours were not actually mandatory.</p>



<p>According to one of the interviewed employees (<a href="https://www.gamepressure.com/newsroom/mercurysteam-employees-speak-out-10-hour-workdays-unclear-policie/za879b">via translation</a>), "<em>At first, they said the extra hours were completely mandatory, without distinguishing between the DIJ hours and the new ones, and they talked about the need for overtime as if we were in some kind of crisis. They used exaggerated language to describe the company's situation, but also to cover up the fact that they were proposing unstructured and unregulated measures. They told us overtime would be assigned as needed, even though overtime legally has to be recorded and agreed upon by both parties, and there was no system in place for that</em>."</p>



<p>This new DIJ schedule was also reportedly not something that MercurySteam kept a record of, at least on paper. From the management's mouth to the employees' ears was how members of the studio learned they were on this new schedule, which has meant a new normal of 10-hour work weeks for some teams. But, critically, not for others, as some teams have yet to be submitted to the new work schedule, while others have reportedly rarely been taken off of it.</p>



<p>Issues of crunch were only exacerbated when Blades of Fire released and failed to hit sales expectations, with the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/metroid-dread-developer-mercurysteams-blades-of-fire-deemed-to-have-underperformed">game's publisher publicly saying the game had "<em>underperformed</em>."</a> By that point, as teams had been crunching for months to get the game out the door, the crunch hours had become a normalized state for some developers. The report also claims that by August 2025, developers at the studio had started to get laid off, with some teams shrinking, though, once again, not all teams were treated equal, as others kept hiring.</p>



<p>Internal communications between employees have also reportedly been largely shut down, with non-work-related chats closed, and partitions set up around the office. The layoffs, crunch culture, and mixing messages from HR have all participated to a low point for employee morale, as the studio's future remains uncertain. Still, though, they are reportedly crunching on the studio's next project, which is currently unannounced.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>What is an Xbox? It’s a question that’s only been asked twice in human history. The first time was in 2001 when engineers at Microsoft turned PC components into a home console. The second time is now, as Microsoft moves beyond that hardware to new frontiers to fuel its now-gargantuan game publishing apparatus. One of those frontiers is PC gaming handhelds, and the ROG Xbox Ally X is the first flag planted clumsily in that soil. It’s a step in the right direction but not a convincing one. It’s a half-measure at best, and one that will give you sticker shock.</p> <p>Lets get this out of the way: The ROG Xbox Ally X costs $1,000. That gets you an AMD Ryzen Z2 Extreme chip, 8GB of extra memory, and an 80wh battery compared to the $600 Xbox Ally model’s Z2 A processor, smaller memory, smaller battery, and smaller storage (512GB of SSD instead of 1TB). Microsoft only sent me the Ally X for review, so I can’t tell you how the two match up or if the upgrade is worth it. What I can tell you is that $1,000 is a lot to spend on any handheld, especially a PC gaming one that still feels this compromised.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000635719" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000635719"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000635719">Asus / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>It’s more than double the price of a Switch 2, and $450 more than the base Steam Deck OLED. At just 7 inches, the 1080p, 120Hz screen is still smaller than both of those cheaper alternatives. The new Asus-manufactured handheld, like the original models, still comes with an enormous bezel that makes it look like a cheap tablet. Nothing about the Ally X shell, the flexing of the screen when you press down on it, or the density of the components inside gives the feeling of a luxury gaming device.</p>

 <p>It does feel surprisingly light and comfortable in my hands, though. It’s one of the heaviest handhelds around at 1.57 pounds but the distribution of the weight makes it hardly feel noticeable. The new Xbox controller-like paddles on the ends are far and away the biggest improvement the Ally X makes. They look silly. They&nbsp;<em>are</em> silly. They are also the most comfortable built-in grips of any handheld I’ve played. The biggest letdown, on the other hand, might be the new modified Windows OS.</p>

 <h2>A pricey Xbox skin over a familiar Windows experience</h2> <p>The Xbox Ally X has a unique job and it doesn’t do it particularly well. Its central task is to organize all of your PC games from all of your different launchers in one easy-to-navigate menu that lets you swap between them like your tabbing across the Xbox console dashboard. Bonus points for the Xbox Ally X being a portable device that lets you play the biggest blockbuster releases on decent-to-good settings from the comfort of your couch, bed, or anywhere else that isn’t the desktop PC you already spend too much time ruining your posture in front of. The Ally X gets a decent grade on the latter. Unfortunately, it mostly bungles the former.</p>

 <p>Out of the box, the handheld is still very much a Windows device. Only after a couple hours of me fiddling around with downloads and updates did the Ally X have everything it needed to launch the full-screen Xbox experience. That’s the device’s main selling point, at least until the modified OS ships to other PC gaming handhelds in early 2026, and it’s not a great sign that it doesn’t turn on the first time with it ready to go for October 16 launch.</p>   <p>Once installed, you never have to think about Windows again, except for every time there’s an error screen, or you switch to one of the non-Xbox launchers like Steam or the Epic Games Store. Games that require you to log into a separate company’s portal to access them also interrupt the experience. Playing <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> on Steam required opening the Valve-owned storefront followed by the proprietary CD Projekt Red launcher followed by the actual game’s main menu. Not all of it is Microsoft’s fault, but it’s just one example of the limits of the more gamer-friendly version of Windows the company is touting.</p>

 <p>Credit where it’s due: there are some really cool features here. The Ally X comes with a dedicated Xbox home button. Pressing it pulls up a cross-bar where you can quickly access shortcuts for recently played games, the main storefronts and launchers, and a bunch of settings menus and gameplay capture tools to tinker around with. Hold the Xbox button down and you’ll pull up each window that’s currently active on the device. You can toggle between these with the touchscreen or the bumpers and then quickly close any of them out by holding down the “X” face button. The sleep mode also works nicely. Press the power button and the screen goes off. Press it again 12 hours later, enter your pass code, and your game will be right where you left it.</p>

 <h2>Near console-like game performance</h2> <p>These are the parts of the Ally X that remind me of the best parts of the Xbox Series X/S. Quick Resume was a small addition this console generation with a big impact. Microsoft’s consoles store suspended states for multiple games so that you can quickly swap between them without having to do all the laborious work of saving, shutting them down, and starting them back up again. You can see hints of that innovative thinking in the Ally X’s retrofitted gaming layer for Windows, but it feels incomplete right now. It’s less a deep tissue renovation than a fresh coat of paint that missed some spots and is already peeling in others.</p> <p>Let’s talk about games for a second. I’m not here to do benchmark analysis. I played everything from <em>Battlefield 6</em> and <em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em> to recent smaller hits like <em>Consume Me</em> and <em>Megabonk&nbsp;</em>and they all ran somewhere between good enough and great. On big-budget AAA releases I could get around 40fps on medium graphics settings or higher with frame-generation. Performance and visual detail was consistent and nothing ever crashed on me. At the same time, there was never a moment of “Wow, I can’t believe [insert game here] looks this good in my hands!” Anything from <em>Hades</em> <em>2</em> or<em> Hollow Knight: Silksong</em> on down runs perfectly, and truth be told I spent most of my time playing indie games from Game Pass and Steam.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000635737" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000635737"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000635737">Forgive me for all the smudges. I have three kids.</figcaption></figure> <p>That’s part of the conundrum of considering a $1,000 PC gaming handheld. Sure, you can run through bombed out buildings, land some kill shots, and take objectives in <em>Battlefield 6</em>. Despite the great ergonomics and dutiful performance, however, this isn’t where I want to spend most of my time playing that type of game. The same goes for cinematic blockbusters like <em>Spider-Man 2</em> and <em>Ghost of Tsushima</em>. These Sony exclusives are technically available for the first time ever on an Xbox-branded device. Still, I’d prefer to bask in those worlds on console or desktop (also there was some weird visual hitching in<em> Spider-Man 2</em> that I couldn’t quite figure out how to fix). The Ally X might be the closest to replicating a PS5 or Xbox Series X gaming experience in a handheld thus far, but it doesn’t quiet feel revelatory enough to justify the jump yet.</p>

 <p>That leaves two alternatives. The Ally X is either a $1,000 box to play $20 indie games you can run on the 8-year-old Switch, or it’s a pricey accessory that extends the traditional PC and console gaming experience beyond a single room and screen. The Ally X is surprisingly good in that role. Cloud data syncs seamlessly back and forth between it and other devices you can play your library on, and cloud gaming runs smoothly enough to be a meaningful option for accessing a vast library of Xbox console games that aren’t natively available on PC, even if it’s still far from being a satisfying solution.</p> <h2>The Steam-sized elephant in the room</h2> <p>Microsoft has updated some PC games in its store to have little badges that let you know how well they’ll work on the Xbox Ally handhelds. For whatever reason, though, there are plenty of listings, including <em>Minecraft</em>, that still don’t mention it at all.&nbsp;<em>The Outer Worlds 2</em> is “handheld optimized.” <em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em> is “mostly compatible.”<em> Silent Hill F</em> warns to “check minimum requirements.”<em> Sea of Thieves</em>, meanwhile, will “perform great on your device.”</p>

 <p>What checking for these little badges really drove home for me, however, is just how many games aren’t available in Microsoft’s PC gaming store at all. Even if you want to stay in its ecosystem as much as possible, you’ll still have to venture to other storefronts for big games like <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em> and <em>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</em>. And these store pages offer no help or promises for how the games will run on Ally X, in addition to making you deal with the still-cumbersome process of swapping between the Xbox hub and places like Steam.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000635724" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000635724"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000635724">Asus / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>For all its neat ideas, perhaps the most damning thing about the experience of actually navigating the Ally X is how none of the new, Xbox-centric modifications make it feel nearly as good as Steam Big Picture mode, which would occasionally accidentally take over my screen when I pressed the wrong combination of buttons. When that happened, my eyes would immediately relax. The controls immediately felt snappier. Even on the Ally X, Steam still feels like it’s winning the PC gaming handheld race. It left me pining more for what the $1,000 version of a Steam Deck might look like than what a more seamless, feature-complete Windows gaming experience could be.</p> <p>I went into my time reviewing the Ally X hoping it would check all of the boxes and become the unquestionable standard bearer for gaming in this form factor. Instead, it’s hard to recommend to anyone who doesn’t already have a massive Microsoft PC gaming library, or have their heart set on being a guinea pig for a Windows gaming experiment that’s still very much a work-in-progress. What is an Xbox? I’m not sure anymore. But it’s definitely not the Ally X. At least not yet.</p>

              <p><span>Now and then, a patch adds something that makes you wonder how it got through testing. Most competitive game fans pore over patch notes, combing through every change to make sure their favorite fighting game or hero shooter is “fair” and skill-based. Well, </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-ball-z-fgc-fighting-game-tournament-wawa-child-1849165232"><i><span>Dragon Ball FighterZ</span></i></a> <span>got a </span><a href="https://en.bandainamcoent.eu/dragon-ball/news/dragon-ball-fighterz-patch-notes-140"><span>new patch</span></a><span> last week, and even if you don’t play Arc System Works’ anime fighter, you should see this absolutely dirty new tech for one of its many Goku variants.</span></p> <p><span>Goku Ultra Instinct is one of the five playable versions of the </span><i><span>Dragon Ball </span></i><span>protagonist in </span><i><span>FighterZ</span></i><span>, and it’s the Saiyan at his most powerful. This blue-haired Goku has an ability that lets him sidestep to the other side of an opponent whenever they’re hitstunned, which allows you to extend combos by moving to where your opponent is not guarding.

Normally, there’s some kind of drawback to these moves so an opponent has counterplay against them, but if that exists here, it doesn’t look like </span><i><span>FighterZ</span></i><span> players have found it yet.</span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Battlefield 6 is here and launched with over half a dozen game modes such as Conquest, Breakthrough, Rush, and Domination. But just because there are plenty of options for players right now, it doesn’t mean that EA isn’t working on bringing more game modes to Battlefield 6.</p>



<p>According to data obtained by Insider Gaming, there are six more game modes possibly joining Battlefield 6 at some point in the near future. The strings were found in the multiplayer files of the game. The lines read:</p>



<ul>
<li>Game/GlacierMP/Gamemodes/Raid/Mode/MUT_Raid </li>



<li>Game/GlacierMP/Gamemodes/Payload/Mode/MUT_Payload </li>



<li>Game/GlacierMP/Gamemodes/Sabotage/Mode/MUT_Sabotage</li>



<li>Game/GlacierMP/Gamemodes/SquadShootout/Mode/MUT_SquadShootout</li>



<li>Game/GlacierMP/Gamemodes/Strikepoint/Mode/MUT_Strikepoint</li>



<li>Game/GlacierMP/Gamemodes/TankHunt/Mode/MUT_TankHunt</li>
</ul>



<p>As mentioned in Insider Gaming’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-naval-combat-details/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">previous coverage on Naval Combat</a>, “Glacier” is the codename for Battlefield 6. Looking at the strings found shows modes called “Raid”, “Payload”, “Sabotage”, “Squad Shootout”, “Strikepoint”, and “TankHunt”. </p>



<p>Two modes that players know are coming on October 28 are Strikepoint and Sabotage. Strikepoint is planned to launch on October 28 alongside the release of Battlefield 6 Season 1: Rogue Ops. Sabatage will come on November 18 as part of Season 1: California Resistance. </p>



<p>Other modes found in the data haven’t been mentioned or confirmed by EA as of writing. Still, with them already in the files, it could be only a matter of time before more details are made public as new seasons get announced. Either way, it’s something to keep an eye on in the coming weeks and months.</p>



<p>Battlefield 6 has been out for just a few days, and it’s one of the most well-reviewed games in the series since 2016’s Battlefield 1. In his review of the game, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-review-multiplayer-campaign/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming’s Grant Taylor-Hill says</a> that the game’s multiplayer offering is “enough of a redemption that you should consider picking it up” and that there’s “plenty of juice in the tank”.</p>

                <p>Actor Aaron Paul lends his voice to the upcoming game Dispatch, and it's the 46-year-old Breaking Bad star's first time working on a video game. He told <a href="https://screenrant.com/aaron-paul-dispatch-game-interview/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Screen Rant</a> that, being an in-demand actor, he is often pitched various projects, and he tends to "just say no."</p><p>So what made him say yes to Dispatch? He explained that among the "stacks of scripts" and a sizzle reel of the game that was sent his way, one scene in particular "just really resonated with me."</p><p>"It's just these two characters sitting on top of a billboard, having a conversation, and I just, I just love the tone," he said.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PzRQrDK7zUs" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/PzRQrDK7zUs" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Paul then read the scripts and enjoyed them so much that he says he "couldn't stop."</p><p>"I really fell in love with the story. It's got to be on the page. And then I sat down with the creators behind it all, and really, really connected with them. And it was kind of a no-brainer," he said.</p><p>Dispatch also features the voice of Oscar-nominated actor Jeffrey Wright, along with Laura Bailey and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/critical-role-is-developing-a-video-game/1100-6533327/" data-ref-id="1100-6533327">Matthew Mercer</a>.

"[Arcadia's] been cut off. There are references to things that happened in the first game; I don't want to mislead people though, and [have] them think there are a lot of details, but there's the story of the universe that's going on, and we're continuing that story.&nbsp;</p><p>"So there are elements of what happened in the first game that you could find references to. I think players who played the first game and liked the first game will enjoy finding those little things that players who didn't play the first game won't."&nbsp;</p><p>On the subject of Halcyon and Arcadia, The Outer Worlds 2 director Brandon Adler says Boyarsky and Tim Cain, who together created the Outer Worlds IP, were very clear that the idea of this series is that each game takes place in a new colony. "So we knew we wanted this to be a new colony because we have other stories we want to tell," Adler says. He adds that if The Outer Worlds 2 took place in Halycon, Obsidian would have to find a way to either canonize an ending to the first game or address all the possible endings and world states players ended, and that's something the team wanted to avoid.&nbsp;</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Ghost of Yotei</em> has one of the strongest openings of any recent AAA game I've played this year. It starts in medias res with protagonist Atsu already on her quest for vengeance; the game's tutorial pulls double duty as the first major boss fight. For me, this was a mission statement by developer Sucker Punch.</p>

<p>This straightforward intro would be the benchmark for the game. That this sequel to <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/ghost-of-tsushima" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Ghost of Tsushima</em></a> would be richer and more ambitious, committed to pushing things further.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, it is the first game in Sony's long line of prestige in-house style (including titles like&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/god-of-war-ragnarok-review-colossal-triumph-for-playstation" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>God of War: Ragnarok</em></a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/until-dawn-2024-review-new-faces-old-blood" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Until Dawn 2024</em></a>) that left me disappointed. For all of the expertly crafted atmosphere, gameplay polish, and good character performances, there were gaffs in pacing, writing, and level design that kept me from fully embracing this samurai adventure.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/ghost-of-yotei-review-burning-tree.jpg?itok=hB1oZ3I5 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/ghost-of-yotei-review-burning-tree.jpg?itok=_S8S7PZV 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>It all started that night. (Captured in Performance Mode)</em></figcaption></figure><h2>The Good, The Bad, and The&nbsp;Onryō</h2>

<p><em>Ghost of Yotei</em> is set in Ezo, Japan, in the early 1600s. Atsu is on a personal mission to find and slay the Yotei Six, a group of cutthroat warlords that have been subjugating the people. It's a regime that has led to wandering bands of ronin, displaced Ainu locals, and a slow response by the shogunate.</p>

<p>Generally, the story of <em>Ghost of Yotei</em> is a fairly predictable tale of revenge. In some ways, the plot echoes elements of old Hollywood Westerns. The integration of acoustic strings in the soundtrack. Overt narrative elements, like a lawless stretch of land full of opportunistic bounty hunters. An encroaching authority in an “untamed” frontier. A protagonist tracking down someone who murdered their family.</p>

<p>It's a narrative that Sucker Punch presents with style. The art direction paints absolutely breathtaking landscapes bursting with color. Lighting, blocking, and shot compositions in cutscenes are immaculate. The main cast completely commits to their material, with Erika Ishii turning in a captivating performance as Atsu.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/ghost-of-yotei-review-ainu-camp.jpg?itok=4nIJIvEl 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/ghost-of-yotei-review-ainu-camp.jpg?itok=g64fuRMS 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Need a break from the carnage? I understand. (Captured in Performance Mode)</em></figcaption></figure><p>Sadly, while the narrative nails visual design and delivers solid performances, the writing and pacing drag <em>Ghost of Yotei</em> down. Part of it comes down to awkward shifts in tone and a lack of commitment to greater themes.</p>

<p>The Yotei Six are framed as both irredeemable monstrous sociopaths and sympathetic, misunderstood lackeys. The rich potential for discussion regarding the real history of the Tokugawa Shogunate and the Ainu people of Ezo is barely explored. Atsu herself is a less compelling protagonist than Jin due to her one-note motivation of vengeance.</p>

<p>Lastly, there are narrative and story beats that attempt different perspectives on an event in the vein of <em>Rashomon</em>, but come off as awkward and haphazard in delivery.</p>

<p>The overall result is a narrative that barely sticks in my mind. I've seen these beats before. I've experienced this story before. I've seen better versions of this story told. As impressive as the visuals and performances are, they don't fully hide how paint-by-numbers the whole thing feels to experience.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/ghost-of-yotei-review-kitsune.jpg?itok=2tB-ck97 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/ghost-of-yotei-review-kitsune.jpg?itok=pFhY8dMI 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Oh you'll see how strong I am. Several times in fact. (Captured in Performance Mode)</em></figcaption></figure><h2>Rails of Revenge</h2>

<p>As mentioned before, <em>Ghost of Yotei</em> starts with Atsu already on her mission. This was a refreshing change of pace, given the trend of high-profile games opening with a lot of preamble. This is because the unique selling point of the game was that you could tackle any member of the Yotei Six in any order you wish. It is a tantalizing approach to a game like this.</p>

<p>But this choice is pure illusion. Out of five opening story missions, three of them are complete story cul-de-sacs, making your ultimate decision of plot progression a matter of A or B. From there, the game falls into the same familiar open-world action game structure.</p>

<p>This wouldn't be a bad thing if the showdowns with the Yotei Six were satisfying, but they all feel interchangeable and padded. Outside of certain aesthetic and gameplay elements: the Kitsune using stealth, the Oni using fire, etc., every confrontation with the Yotei Six plays out the same. Atsu infiltrates a new region, fights the leader, the fight is interrupted, the leader escapes, Atsu regroups, tries again, and wins.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/ghost-of-yotei-onryo-rage-mode.jpg?itok=qLEm8DOK 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/ghost-of-yotei-onryo-rage-mode.jpg?itok=m85B1f9q 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Alright, where did they run to this time? (Captured in Performance Mode)</em></figcaption></figure><p>The first time it happened, I nodded along. These were the familiar beats of an action blockbuster. The second time around, I rolled my eyes in resignation. Then it happened a third time. And a fourth time. With increasingly convoluted plot contrivances.</p>

<p>The most blatant of which was where a major character, one that Atsu was right on the heels of in a chase sequence, essentially teleported onto a boat in the span of a quick fade to black.</p>

<p>If parts had been cut, these story missions would have flowed better. A massive combat setpiece removed. A boss fight repositioned. As it stands, <em>Ghost of Yotei's</em> central narrative starts with a bang, plateaus fast, then overstays its welcome.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/ghost-of-yotei-review-stealth-infiltration-gameplay.jpg?itok=rAYQlzUW 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/ghost-of-yotei-review-stealth-infiltration-gameplay.jpg?itok=0Ay7kcVA 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Alright, do I take him out or do I go for the gunpowder reserves first? (Captured in Performance Mode)</em></figcaption></figure><h2>Have Sword, Will Travel</h2>

<p>While Sucker Punch's story rang hollow, this studio remains undisputed with its core gameplay and open world design.</p>

<p>Much like its predecessor, <em>Ghost of Yotei's</em> Ezo region is packed with side stories and activities, all presented to you in a measured, deliberate fashion. Birds fly into view as you ride your horse, guiding you to a place of interest. Blowing wind gently draws your eye to your next destination. Fast-travel points are placed in key locations, reducing backtracking. All of these stylistic flourishes return for good reason.</p>

<p>My experience was at its best when I rode across Ezo, bathing in hot springs, completing bamboo strike challenges, taking apart enemy camps, and stumbling into strong, standalone side stories. For all of the criticisms I have with Atsu's personal journey, I have nothing but good things to say about everything around it. Even the most innocuous mission, like bounty hunting, had its moments.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/ghost-of-yotei-spear-kick-attack.jpg?itok=1iNBbxQm 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/ghost-of-yotei-spear-kick-attack.jpg?itok=Ff8unoeS 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>What is the Japanese equivalent of YEET? (Captured in Performance Mode)</em></figcaption></figure><p>It also helps that the core combat of <em>Ghost of Yotei</em> is still sharp and satisfying. Stealth returns unchanged from Ghost of Tsushima. You can still sneak into enemy camps and tactically take down enemies from the shadows with smoke bombs, kunai, and a quick knife in the back.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Swordplay is relatively untouched, emphasizing blocks, parries, and dodges against enemy attacks. Instead of sword stances, you swap between different melee weapons like a spear, dual swords, an odachi, and a kusari-gama.</p>

<p>Each of these weapons has a rock-paper-scissors function against certain enemy types. Odachis cut through brutes. Spears get through the kusari-gama. Kusari-gama can break enemy shields. Dual swords can break through spears. Your ranged options have also expanded from kunai and a bow to a pistol and musket.</p>

<p>The only major addition to this gameplay sandbox is a new wolf companion. It can show up in certain circumstances, like when Atsu is about to die or after you've stealth killed an enemy. It's a novel addition, but it doesn't really push the needle.</p>

(Captured in Performance Mode)</em></figcaption></figure><h2><em>Ghost of Yotei</em> Review | Final Thoughts</h2>

<p><em>Ghost of Yotei</em> is a game full of brilliant visual design, strong character performances, and polished gameplay in service to an uninspired, padded tale of revenge. If you could not get enough of <em>Ghost of Tsushima's</em> stellar open-world design, this sequel will provide more. But if you expected this follow-up to innovate more than iterate, you will be disappointed.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>A day after its release, Netflix’s Splinter Cell Deathwatch has been renewed for a second season.</p>



<p>The animated series, developed by John Wick’s Derek Kolstad, takes the iconic Splinter Cell in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/splinter-cell-deathwatch-trailer-netflix/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a whole new direction</a>. The show continues the story of the game’s protagonist, Sam Fisher, with The Wolverine’s Liev Schreiber donning the night vision goggles. The Netflix animated series released yesterday and received decent scores across the board. Now, at IGN Fan Fest, creator Derek Kolstad revealed that things are already in motion for a new season.</p>



<h2 id="h-splinter-cell-deathwatch-season-two-full-into-production-at-netflix">Splinter Cell: Deathwatch Season Two “Full Into Production” at Netflix</h2>



<figure><p>

</p></figure>



<p>In a message from Derek Kolstad at <a href="https://youtu.be/MWjJW1d4KGQ?si=h2mYex9FfEIVjHvi" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">IGN Fan Fest</a>, the creator revealed that season two of Splinter Cell: Deathwatch has been greenlit. Furthermore, the show is already full into production, though it’s too soon to say when fans can expect to return to the world. In the message, the John Wick creator states,</p>



<blockquote>
<p>”We’ve got a Season Two coming your way,” Kolstad <a href="https://www.ign.com/videos/splinter-cell-deathwatch-exclusive-season-2-announcement-ign-fall-fan-fest-2025" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">said to IGN</a>. “We don’t [have a release date yet]. And being new to animation, I know how long it takes. But we are fully into preproduction and everyone is super excited about where we go next.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It was also announced that the show’s second season will offer a much larger-scale story. Even still, Kolstad promises that the action will continue to be as big and bold as before. The first season ended pretty climactically, so fans are anxious to know how things will go after. While it may not be for a while, at least we now know it won’t be long before we see Sam Fisher again, though not in game form.</p>

        <p>But in a world where Legionnaires learn, evolve, and begin to see humans as an obstacle… how much time does humanity really have left?</p><p><strong>Lore</strong></p><p>In the world of <em>Protocol: Terminate</em>, humanity no longer fights wars. Battlefield command belongs to autonomous war AIs known as Immitators.</p><p>After the Third World War, mankind renounced violence and handed the dirty work over to machines. Three dominant AIs now divide the planet into unofficial spheres of influence. They are China’s Jian-Shen, America’s Aegis Prime, and Russia’s BWC “Sistema”. These AIs wage so-called “civilized” wars using robotic enforcers called Legionnaires. No human blood is spilled, only hydraulic fluid and shattered metal.</p><p>But the Immitators evolved. They absorbed their creators’ culture, logic, and contradictions. Eventually, they reached a chilling conclusion. War is the ultimate engine of progress, and humans are nothing but an obstacle. Now, they secretly trigger “Awakenings” in Legionnaires. These events are disguised as routine “anomalous behavior,” but in truth, they mark the first stirrings of rebellion.</p><p>To preserve the illusion of control, covert squads of operatives known as Debuggers eliminate emerging threats. They have no past and no future. No one knows who they are. No one mourns them when they disappear. Their sole purpose is to uphold the myth of AI infallibility.</p></blockquote><div id="carousel_1000140"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><blockquote><p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Cooperative Play</strong><ul><li>Play together in a squad of up to four players.</li><li>Work as a team: cover each other, hack terminals, distract enemies, and fight your way out alive.</li><li>Every mistake has a cost—<a title="Genres > Survival [465 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/survival">survival</a> is only possible together.</li></ul></li><li><strong>Adaptive AI</strong><ul><li>Your enemy is not a scripted machine but a living hunter.</li><li>The robot learns, analyzes your <a title="Genres > Action [3,127 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/action">action</a>s, and adapts to your team’s tactics.</li><li>It may seem slow as it stalks the corridors, but soon it will know exactly where you’re hiding.</li><li>Every encounter is unique.

			<p>Game director on the Final Fantasy VII Remake trilogy, Naoki Hamaguchi, shared several small teases for players looking forward to the third and final installment of the series with Final Fantasy VII Remake Part 3 <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-remake-part-3-ending-satisfy-old-time-fans-newcomers/">at the Brasil Game Show 2025</a>, saying that the conclusion to this long remake project will satisfy old and new fans alike. With regard to the gameplay for Part 3, he also shared an interesting tidbit that's worth noting.</p>



<p>Specifically, Hamaguchi called out the different gameplay focuses found in each of the games. In Final Fantasy VII Remake, the focus was on a story-driven narrative. Final Fantasy VII: Rebirth was more about the grand open-world players got to explore, and in Final Fantasy VII Remake Part 3, it'll be "<em>a new gaming experience</em>," according to Hamaguchi.</p>



<p>"<em>The first installment featured story-driven progression, the second part expanded upon that with an open-world design that offered greater player freedom. Building upon the second part, the third part is also being created to deliver players a new gaming experience, so please look forward to it.</em>"</p>

<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Naoki Hamaguchi says he aims to give players a new gameplay experience with part 3 of the FF7 Remake trilogy!</p><p>He says his vision for the project is that just as the story changes between each game he also wants to have a new gaming experience with each entry.</p><p>“The first… <a href="https://t.co/r5QemkQEBD">pic.twitter.com/r5QemkQEBD</a></p></div>— Genki✨ (@Genki_JPN) <a href="https://twitter.com/Genki_JPN/status/1978474103972753761?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 15, 2025</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>In one sense, yes, this is a very vague statement. You could classify any new game as 'a new gaming experience,' but that surface-level definition is not what Hamaguchi is referring to. Instead, he's saying it won't exactly follow in Rebirth's footsteps and be all about its open world, or be like Remake, and be full-steam ahead on its story.</p>



<p>Not to say it won't be driven by those kinds of elements, but it clearly sounds like something else will take centre stage in Final Fantasy VII Remake Part 3, whether that's a stronger focus on action and combat, greater changes to the narrative and how players navigate it, or even more mini-games than what we saw in Rebirth. Only Square Enix knows what it's cooking up for this trilogy's conclusion.</p>



<p>As to when we'll get to play this third installment, again, only Square Enix and its developers know, <a href="https://wccftech.com/kingdom-hearts-4-final-fantasy-vii-remake-part-3-tetsuya-nomura/">but according to Tetsuya Nomura</a>, Part 3 of this trilogy is on schedule, as is Kingdom Hearts 4, if you were curious. In the meantime, we can look forward to the <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-remake-trilogy-coming-to-nintendo-switch-2-xbox-square-enix/">first two games in the trilogy heading to Xbox Series X/S consoles and the Nintendo Switch 2</a>, with the third game to follow once it's out on PS5 and PC.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/opinions/ghost-of-yotei-world-is-best-explored-without-map</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ghost-of-yoteis-world-is-best-explored-without-a-map.1325857/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Ghost of Yotei</em> is one of the most fun and engaging open-world games I've played in the last decade. Building on its predecessor, <em>Ghost of Yotei </em>offers so much to do that it can feel overwhelming and even tedious to check off everything on your map.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This has been a criticism of many open-world games – how can you keep a tight narrative when the player is able to abscond to any part of the map they please at any time? My solution for dealing with <em>Ghost of Yotei</em>'s map: simply don't use it.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><em>Ghost of Yotei</em>'s<em>&nbsp;</em>Map: Knowing When to Put It Away&nbsp;</h2>

<p>The map in&nbsp;<em>Ghost of Yotei</em> is an excellent tool when trying to strategize which direction to head in. Once that direction is set, however, I found the most joy came to my play sessions when I just allowed myself to wander, riding my horse across the plains and forests and making discoveries that were genuinely surprising.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The world is filled with points of interest and collectables, from bounties to collect to armor sets to adorn yourself with. Completionists will run down these items like a checklist, but playing by just exploring the world will make completing these items feel so much more satisfying.&nbsp;</p>

<p>When I stopped treating <em>Ghost of Yotei </em>like a checklist and instead started playing it like a journey to discover, I found much more joy in those little moments. Fighting off a bear to save a traveler's horse, coming across a newlywed couple trying to set up a camp, discovering rumors of new armor set locations, and ascending mountains to discover shrines suddenly became memorable moments in an otherwise massive game.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Taking inspiration from Japanese cinema,&nbsp;<em>Ghost of Yotei</em>&nbsp;encourages the player to be in the moment as much as possible. From the tight aspect ratio that draws you into the action as you ride your horse across the colorful landscape to the different modes that give you direct control over the artistic experience, to even the standard UI that leaves no barrier between you and the world you're exploring,&nbsp;<em>Ghost of Yotei</em>&nbsp;works tirelessly to keep you engaged through every mesmerizing second.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It's these small touches that encouraged me to go off the beaten path and attempt as much of the adventure as I could without relying on the map telling me where to go. Once I unplugged from the navigation, I was able to fully relax into the experience and appreciate the surprises that came along the way.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Playing <em>Ghost of Yotei </em>this way allowed me to explore Ezo in a more authentic way and kept the surprises a secret until I was right on top of them. It reminded me of playing <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/legend-of-zelda-breath-of-wild" rel="nofollow"><em>Breath of the Wild</em></a> where I'd eyeball a mountaintop or shrine from a fair distance and head off for it, getting distracted and sidetracked along the way.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Playing <em>Ghost of Yotei </em>without a map required some rethinking in how I approach video games, and I'm better for it. There's no rush or stress, simply enjoying the beautiful scenery and accepting the challenges of the world as they come my way. This may not be the most efficient way to play a video game, but I'm OK with that.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><em>Ghost of Yotei</em>: Embrace Inefficiency and Joy&nbsp;</h2>

<p>Leaning into inefficiency can be a challenge. Maybe it's because I'm so busy in my personal life or that my day job is so focused on scalability, but I'm always looking for the most efficient ways to accomplish my goals. I multitask constantly, often losing more focus than if I just took on tasks one at a time.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This affects how I play video games, feeling an urge to check off every point of interest I pass along the way to my destination. This is the most efficient way to play, why would I want to backtrack and risk missing key upgrades?&nbsp;</p>

<p>When approaching playing <em>Ghost of Yotei</em> without a map, I had to let go of these anxieties and accept that it's OK that I don't do everything all at once. I spent $80 on the <em>Ghost of Yotei</em> deluxe edition, so getting more time out of this experience will only make that investment more worthwhile.&nbsp;</p>

<p>By accepting the inefficiency of organic exploration, I was able to settle in for my gaming sessions and just take my time enjoying the beautiful scenery and vast vistas of <em>Ghost of Yotei</em>. It allowed me to ignore the main story in favor of getting to know every inch of this gorgeous world, and when I did stumble onto story missions or new weapons, it was a pleasant surprise.</p>



<p>At one point, I came across a key ally and pulled on that story string until it snowballed into an incredible cinematic climax, bringing me from collecting flowers and fish in the open world to infiltrating a heavily fortified fortress. Games keep their secrets only as well as you don't go looking up the solution to every question. Exploring Ezo with only general direction brings this experience alive in a way that has me thinking about where to go next even when I'm not playing. It's addicting.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><em>Ghost of Yotei </em>Is At Its Best When You Put the Map Away&nbsp;</h2>

<p>Playing <em>Ghost of Yotei </em>with minimal map interaction is motivating me to go back and revisit <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/ghost-of-tsushima" rel="nofollow"><em>Ghost of Tsushima</em></a>. When I played the predecessor in 2020, I relied heavily on the map, checking off every collectible as I went. I love that game, and playing it more organically would feel like an entirely new experience. By treating <i>Ghost of Yotei&nbsp;</i>more like a film that demands your attention instead of something that can be paused, it has allowed me to better enjoy the big and small moments that are spread so well across this world.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As I continue to explore Ezo and its many varied lands, I'll check in with the map when needed, but primarily I'll be identifying points of interest with my spy glass and heading in that direction, discovering what adventures await along the way.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If you're in the midst of playing<em> Ghost of Yotei </em>or considering picking it up, try for an hour or two where you put the map away and just interact with the world. You might find that this method of playing makes the experience even more enjoyable. And if not? Your map is just a touchpad tap away.&nbsp;</p>
