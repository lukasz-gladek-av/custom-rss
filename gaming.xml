            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                                        <p dir="ltr">The Girls' Frontline series is back in a big way with the release of Girls' Frontline 2: Exilium—now available on PC and mobile! This free-to-play strategy RPG sequel builds on everything fans loved in the original game, now with a fully 3D battlefield, evolved mechanics, and a fresh roster of Tactical Dolls (T-Dolls) ready for action.</p><p dir="ltr">Whether you're a returning Commander or just starting out, Exilium offers a gorgeous, anime-inspired experience thanks to next-gen rendering tech, deep tactical gameplay, and a variety of mini-games to keep things fresh. It's everything you loved about the original and so much more.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Battle-Ready T-Dolls Take the Spotlight</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1601/16018044/4528326-gf2-1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4528326" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1601/16018044/4528326-gf2-1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4528326"></a><figcaption>Springfield and Peri are ready for action.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1601/16018044/4528326-gf2-1.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">The latest update brings new Elite T-Dolls to recruit, with increased drop-rates for Springfield, Peri, and Mechty (Rerun). Each brings their own strengths to your squad—and yes, you can deck them out in stylish outfits, too.</p><p dir="ltr">Springfield, a powerhouse support unit, is perfect for Hydro-focused teams. Her ability to overheal and boost allies makes her an essential part of any strong lineup. She's available now in the limited-time Targeted Procurement banner, so if you've been hoarding Collapse Pieces and Targeted Access Permissions, now's your chance.</p><p dir="ltr">Pair her with the Radiance rifle: a custom Elite-class weapon designed just for her. It increases Hydro damage team-wide, boosts HP by 15%, and amplifies Springfield's key abilities. Based on the real-world M1903, this sleek rifle delivers both style and stopping power.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Peri Brings the Fire</h2><p dir="ltr">Peri–a Bulwark unit–is all about aggressive tactics. She dishes out Burn damage at the cost of her own HP, but can activate a powerful shield to stay in the fight longer. You can unlock her for free through the Standard Banner by completing event tasks during the current limited-time event.</p><p dir="ltr">Her signature weapon? A deceptively dainty SMG based on the MP5H1 that hits like a truck. And don't sleep on Faye—her elite handgun, Hestia, modeled after the CZ75, turns her into a true Goddess of Flame on the battlefield and is a portable powerhouse.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Dress to Impress: Limited-Time Outfits</h2><p dir="ltr">What's a new T-Doll without a killer outfit? Several stunning looks are available at limited-time discounts:</p><p dir="ltr">Springfield's "Queen in Radiance" outfit isn't just elegant—it's also the first 3D main screen wallpaper in the game, complete with dance interactions and Scenic Tour animations.</p><p dir="ltr">Faye's "Flurry Crimson" ensemble channels her inner flame with dancer-inspired flair.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Style Up Your Arsenal</h2><p dir="ltr">Don't let your weapons feel left out, because new skins are here too! Springfield's Midnight Waltz pairs perfectly with her Radiance outfit for a dazzling ballroom blitz combo. And for a retro-futuristic edge, grab the Dawn Sentry, a stylish homage to old-school sci-fi.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Free Pulls, Codes, and a Shot at Real-World Prizes</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4528328-gf-2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4528328" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4528328-gf-2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4528328"></a><figcaption>Here's a closer look at all the rewards you can earn in the game.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4528328-gf-2.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Girls' Frontline 2: Exilium is feeling generous this month, as you can grab 40 free banner pulls, the free T-Doll Faye, free Targeted Access Permissions, and more this month.</p><p dir="ltr">There's also a chance to win prizes like the iPhone 16, Razer keyboard, and tons of in-game loot through the Defend Zucchero Café event.</p><p dir="ltr">Got a US server account?

Top cosplayers brought characters like Springfield, Makiatto, Centaureissi, and Sharkry to life, making the booth a major attraction.</p><p dir="ltr">In case you missed it, you can check out photos and videos of the Girls Frontline 2 by searching for hashtags like #GirlsFrontline2Exilium and #gfl2exilium on various social media platforms.</p><p dir="ltr">Whether you're strategizing in battle or styling your T-Dolls to perfection, now's the perfect time to jump into Girls' Frontline 2: Exilium.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I'm genuinely asking. I force myself to open it up every week or two for professional reasons (people still inexplicably send me DMs and such), and every time I do I'm confronted by three things.</p><p>The first is wall-to-wall garbage. Slop. Ads for crypto scams, ads for AI scams, ads for dropshippers that will never deliver the product they're selling, ads for all of the above right in the middle of replies to a thread. All of them occupying the space that used to contain discussions, or at least (and how low is this bar!) ads from real companies.</p><p>The second is, well.<a href="https://www.wired.com/story/grok-antisemitic-posts-x-xai" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> This</a> (which <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/701884/grok-antisemitic-hitler-posts-elon-musk-x-xai" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">prompted some emergency work behind the scenes</a>)</p><figure><figcaption>Source: <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/grok-antisemitic-posts-x-xai" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wired</a></figcaption></figure><p>Elon Musk first bought the site in 2022. It's now July 2025, and I just don't know how else to ask this but: what will it take to get you off Twitter? Because the third thing I see, despite all the fascists and slopsters and antisemitic artificial intelligence, despite the cliff-like drop-off in engagement metrics, is people I know still going through the motions and<a href="https://aftermath.site/summer-game-fest-2025-switch-2-launch-geoff-keighley" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> using the site like it was 2017</a>.</p><p>I refuse to believe there is anything you are getting there, whether it be social or professional, that is worth the constant exposure to and indirect support of an outwardly fascist social media platform. Like, read the paragraph above this one back to yourself, and tell me honestly if it's worth all of that just so you can continue to try to post some anime memes or catch some sports highlights or talk to the other three people you're still talking to who haven't deleted their account or moved to Bluesky because "I'm just tired of making new social media accounts, man".</p><p>I realise Aftermath still "posts" to Twitter, in that we have a central platform that shares our links to all our social media at once, and that gnaws at me on a weekly basis. I wanted to delete our Twitter<a href="https://x.com/LukePlunkett/status/1861687549972164623" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> when I wiped my own account last year</a>, but was outvoted (we have 14k followers there, people are still discovering our work there, etc), which is how a cooperatively owned company works. </p><p>But like, is even <em>this </em>bad? Does even a fire-and-forget model, where very few people are actively engaging with our work and we are not engaging with it as a staff <em>at all</em>, help prop up this dogshit platform? I think so, especially as it gets worse and worse, somehow even worse than last year when I first brought it up. And I think the same of everyone else, from IGN to Kotaku to GameSpot to Eurogamer, who are auto-posting there as well. It’s just not worth it!</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/hideaki-anno-is-animes-ultimate-wife-guy"><h3>Hideaki Anno Is Anime’s Ultimate Wife Guy</h3></a><p>Moyoco and Hideaki Anno might dethrone Sailor Moon and Hunter X Hunter’s creators as anime’s it couple.</p></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div><br/><br/>https://aftermath.site/twitter-elon-musk-grok-antisemitic-mechahitler]]></content:encoded>

<p>Toby Fox's latest game <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/deltarune">Deltarune</a> arrived on the Switch 2 alongside the new chapters last month and since then it's been getting some additional patches.</p>
<p>The latest one has now arrived and it bumps the Switch and Switch 2 version up to Version 1.02. It's a "bugfix patch" resolving multiple issues across Chapters 2, 3 and 4. There are also some Switch 2-specific fixes, and there have been some other minor updates made across "all chapters".</p>
<p>Here's the full rundown (<a href="https://nintendoeverything.com/deltarune-1-02-update-out-now-patch-notes/">via Nintendo Everything</a>):</p>
<h3>Deltarune (Version 1.02) - 8th July 2025</h3>
<p><strong>Chapter 2</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed an issue in the room with fireworks where the floor switch can be pressed by an invisible character.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Chapter 3</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Key Items received from the Ball Machine no longer incorrectly persist outside of that room. This caused numerous issues, including not being able to receive the Shadow Crystal from a certain boss.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where Susie and Ralsei would appear completely shadowed if defeated by a boss’s attack.</li>
<li>In a room where Susie destroys houses, she no longer stops moving erroneously after the battle. However, she now slides around erroneously. Apparently, this is better.</li>
<li>Attempted to fix issues on Board 1 where you can see duplicate Ralseis as well as make Ralsei disappear indefinitely.</li>
<li>Fixed some situations where borders were not displaying correctly.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Chapter 4</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed some places where the characters were the normal color in an area that has abnormal coloration.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where it’s possible to get temporarily stuck in a playable piano.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue during an optional battle where the damage numbers done to the players were not visible. Additionally, the heal numbers were moving further to the right every time they appeared.</li>
<li>Removed the erroneous appearance of a duplicate Kris in the closet.</li>
<li>[Switch 2-only] Fixed an exploit where you can generate infinite untouchable cats if you touch them with the backside of the shield.</li>
<li>[Switch 2-only] Fixed a misalignment of the petting effect and the mouse position.</li>
<li>[Switch 2-only] Fixed a crash if you saved your game in the “Mike Zone” on Nintendo Switch, then imported your save file to Nintendo Switch 2 and continued from there.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>All Chapters</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>“Master Volume” setting now persists between Chapters when using the same file.</li>
<li>Updated the save data import messages when first launching the game. Now, if you have more than one app’s save data on your console (for example, if you have saves from both the older version of the Chapter 1&amp;2 demo as well as the newer version), it will display them as a list so you can choose the one you want to import. (Note: The import messages only appear if you have no existing save data for the full version of the game…)</li>
<li>[Switch 2-only] Fixed an issue where the game displays at the wrong size on 1440p. Additionally, there are several other minor aesthetic fixes across chapters 2, 3, and 4.</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>The developer also notes how testing of the next patch is "already underway" and the next two patches will contain some "extremely slight adjustments to gameplay in addition to bug fixes".</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/confirmed-nintendo%E2%80%99s-switch-2-can-work-with-existing-docks-and-webcams-after-replacing-their-firmware.1238862/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Over the last two weeks, I’ve sought to uncover why the Nintendo Switch 2 didn’t work with a host of USB-C accessories that worked perfectly fine with other devices, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/report/695915/switch-2-usb-c-third-party-docks-dont-work-authentication-encryption">including third-party docks</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/report/693182/nintendo-switch-2-webcam-mystery-1080p-480p-uvc-iso-bulk-ugreen-elgato">some of the best-reviewed webcams</a>. But today, I have first-hand confirmation that existing gadgets <em>can</em> work — as long as their manufacturers issue the right firmware updates, and as long as Nintendo doesn’t break compatibility from here on out.</p><p>You shouldn’t necessarily need to buy a brand-new gadget to plug a TV or video glasses into your Nintendo Switch 2. Three manufacturers have already proven that firmware updates are enough for now, and hopefully more will follow!</p><p>The existing gadgets I just successfully tested are: the <strong>AverMedia Elite Go GC313 Pro</strong> and <strong>AverMedia Core Go GC313</strong> compact charger docks, the <strong>Elgato Facecam MK.2 </strong>webcam, and the <strong>Viture Pro Mobile Dock</strong> for the company’s AR glasses.</p><p>None of them worked with the Nintendo Switch 2 at launch, but each now has firmware updates available, and I was able to get them all working in my own home — and maybe, set a few more things straight about Switch 2 compatibility.</p><div><p id="elgato"><h2>Elgato</h2></p></div><p><strong>The story:</strong> Elgato was one of the very first companies to promise it would update some non-working webcams to work with the Switch 2, and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/report/693182/nintendo-switch-2-webcam-mystery-1080p-480p-uvc-iso-bulk-ugreen-elgato">provided its own theories to <em>The Verge</em></a> on why they didn’t work on day one. The company won’t formally release its firmware updates for the Facecam MK2 and Facecam Neo till the end of July, but it sent us an early copy so I could show you video proof!</p><p>Here, follow along with me as I install and test it for the very first time:</p><p>(Sorry, I’m not allowed to share the early firmware update files.)</p><p><strong>What we learned: </strong>Elgato originally claimed the primary reason its cameras didn’t work was that the Nintendo Switch 2 requires cameras to advertise a low-resolution 480p video mode, even if that’s not the mode the Switch 2 winds up using. Sure enough: <a href="https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/all/how-to-use-and-install-usbview/e66494f9-05ce-439e-bcbe-c074b36d4272">the USBView tool</a> shows me that the Facecam MK2 now makes 480p the default video streaming mode that a USB host device (like the Switch 2) will see before anything else.</p><p>Also: Remember when Ugreen told us that cameras wouldn’t work with Switch 2 if they used the HID (human interface device) protocol? Weirdly, it seems Elgato actually <em>added</em> some HID references in its latest firmware. <a href="https://www.diffchecker.com/S0k5VI8i/">Here’s the diff</a> if you want to peek.</p><div><p id="avermedia"><h2>AverMedia</h2></p></div><div><p><cite>Photo by Sean Hollister / The Verge</cite></p></div><p><strong>The story:</strong> I’d never even heard of these 100W GaN compact charging docks, the $130 GC313 Pro and the $90 GC313 — but it now appears they’re the first and only portable docks for the Switch 2! (The Pro also doubles as a 1080p60 USB capture card, if you’re wondering about the price delta.) The company has <a href="https://www.avermedia.com/NS2-compatibility-status">a whole page dedicated to Switch 2 compatibility firmware updates</a>, mostly for its video capture devices, but also these portable docks, as well as <a href="https://www.amazon.com/AVerMedia-Charging-Screen-Mirroring-Capture/dp/B0DBSND34P?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">a more traditional standing dock</a> if you don’t mind plugging your Switch in upside-down.</p><p><strong>What we learned</strong>: The firmware update was quick to install and the HDMI connection totally works — probably because AverMedia’s dock is now using the exact same proprietary commands that we see Nintendo’s official dock using. (<a href="https://www.theverge.com/report/695915/switch-2-usb-c-third-party-docks-dont-work-authentication-encryption">Once again</a>, I pulled out a USB-C PD analyzer to check. Before the update, AverMedia’s dock didn’t speak Nintendo’s language and was quickly rejected; after the update, it did.)</p><p>AverMedia’s dock didn’t work quite as reliably as the official dock in my early tests. It doesn’t always connect the first time I plug it in, and there’s also a short delay. Also note: the GC313 only seems to support vanilla 4K60 output with no HDR or VRR.</p><p>As you’ll read below, video glasses maker Viture has a firmware update that makes its gadgets compatible with Switch 2 — but <em>takes away</em> compatibility with the original Nintendo Switch. But I tested the AverMedia dock working with <em>both</em> generations of Switch, and Viture says it’ll do the same in future.</p><div><p id="viture"><h2>Viture</h2></p></div><p><strong>The story</strong>: This $130 dock is a battery pack that can power your handheld or phone, while routing its video to Viture’s USB-C video glasses or a USB-C monitor. (The HDMI port is for input, not output to a TV.) <a href="https://academy.viture.com/mobile_dock/update">With a firmware update</a>, it gains support for Switch 2, but breaks support for the original Switch unless you downgrade afterwards. A future update will support both, though, Viture co-founder Emily Wang tells <em>The Verge</em>.</p><p><strong>What we learned</strong>: Viture shipped me its dock pre-updated, so I didn’t test before-and-after. But with the update, it totally works — after a bit of a delay, which seems to stem from some miscommunication between Viture’s gadgets and the Switch 2, if I’m reading the USB-C PD traffic right. But after that miscommunication, I can see the Viture dock sends the exact same proprietary commands as Nintendo’s official dock.</p><p>One of the things we’d heard early on is that Switch 2 docking stations need to offer 20 volts of power for the Switch 2 to kick into TV mode — even though the handheld only actually uses 15 volts. But the Viture dock only advertises a maximum of 15 volts at 1.34 amps (20 watts in total), and yet Viture got video output working anyhow.</p><div><p id="what-happens-next"><h2>What happens next?</h2></p></div><p>We know these third-party docks are working with the Switch 2 as of today, and we expect more are on the way.</p><p>(One I didn’t get to test is <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/switch2/comments/1lrs7mh/hagibis_switch_2_dock_hdmi_cable_for_only_20/">this Hagabis</a>, which fits the entire HDMI adapter into a cable instead of a dock — beware that <a href="https://hagibis.bbscloud.com/info/38597196f50d47b0a523a002dd8590ba?csr=1">the firmware update</a> only official works with the 8K version <strong>which is black</strong>, <em>not white or red and blue </em>and keeps going out of stock.)</p><p>But we don’t know if Nintendo will move to block these accessories with firmware updates of its own. Today, it appears that each of these docks can fool the Switch 2 into thinking they’re the official dock by emulating its commands, but several manufacturers admit that could lead to a game of cat-and-mouse where they have to issue new firmware updates to keep up with Nintendo.</p><p>“Similar to what Antank shared with you, it’s true that we may need to provide firmware updates if Nintendo changes its protocol specifications,” Viture tells<em> The Verge. </em></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/701381/confirmed-nintendos-switch-2-can-work-with-existing-docks-and-webcams-after-replacing-their-firmware]]></content:encoded>

This step is part of our ongoing, targeted restructuring and global cost-saving efforts, and reflects the needs on the studio’s projects. While this was not an easy decision, it was a necessary one given our operational priorities. We remain committed to supporting those affected with comprehensive severance packages, extended health-care benefits, and career transition assistance. We deeply appreciate their hard work and the impact they’ve had on Ubisoft.</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">Ubisoft PR also confirmed that no other Ubisoft locations were impacted by today's layoffs. However, the company did not respond to IGN's request for information on how many employees remain at Red Storm or the status of the company's current projects.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Ubisoft Red Storm was originally Red Storm Entertainment, founded by author Tom Clancy specifically to make games based on his novels, including Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six. The studio was acquired by Ubisoft in 2000, going on to create hits such as the Tom Clancy's Ghost Recon series and assisting on other popular Tom Clancy games such as The Division. In more recent years, it has taken a backseat role as more of a VR and support studio beginning with Werewolves Within in 2016. and continuing more recently with Star Trek: Bridge Crew and Assassin's Creed Nexus VR.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Red Storm also worked on a canceled Splinter Cell VR game, and the also-canceled <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-cancels-the-division-heartland">The Division Heartland</a>. Most recently, Red Storm assisted on XDefiant, which just shut down completely last month after <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-is-discontinuing-xdefiant-in-2025-new-purchases-disabled">an announcement last year</a>. At the time, Ubisoft shut down the San Francisco and Osaka studios behind the game, with <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-08-16/ubisoft-entertainment-cuts-45-people-from-its-us-staff?embedded-checkout=true" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">some layoffs occuring at Red Storm as well</a>.

                <p dir="ltr">Ubisoft has laid off a number of employees at its Red Storm studio, which has most recently focused on a number of VR initiatives for the publisher, as well as supporting development on titles such as XDefiant.</p><p dir="ltr">As <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/tom-clancy-star-trek-bridge-crew-studio-ubisoft-red-storm-lays-off-19-citing-global-cost-saving-efforts" rel="nofollow ">reported by IGN</a>, Ubisoft has cut 19 jobs at Red Storm, citing "ongoing, targeted restructuring and global cost-saving efforts" for its reasoning.</p><p dir="ltr">Ubisoft released a full statement to IGN, which reads, "Today, Ubisoft made the decision to eliminate 19 roles at Red Storm Entertainment. This step is part of our ongoing, targeted restructuring and global cost-saving efforts, and reflects the needs on the studio’s projects. While this was not an easy decision, it was a necessary one given our operational priorities. We remain committed to supporting those affected with comprehensive severance packages, extended health-care benefits, and career transition assistance. We deeply appreciate their hard work and the impact they’ve had on Ubisoft."</p><p dir="ltr">It is currently unclear how deep these cuts at Red Storm, which has become a VR and support studio over the last several years, go or how they will impact any ongoing projects at the team. Ubisoft PR confirmed to IGN though that this restructuring is not indicative of any larger cuts occurring at the French publisher or of its other teams.</p><p dir="ltr">Red Storm, which was founded in 1996 and created stalwart franchises under the Tom Clancy banner such as the Rainbow Six and Ghost Recon series, most recently released Assassin's Creed Nexus VR, which is exclusively available on Meta Quest 2 and above. Besides this release, which marks the long-running franchise's debut on virtual reality platforms, the studio has spent much of the last few years supporting games like XDefiant, which was shut down earlier this year, and working on a pair of canceled projects, including a canned Splinter Cell VR title and a free-to-play spin-off title in The Division series subtitled Heartland.</p><p dir="ltr">The former was axed back in 2022 while the latter lingered for a while longer--even being played in closed alpha tests--before being indefinitely delayed and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-cancels-the-division-heartland-but-the-division-3-is-still-coming/1100-6523480/">ultimately shelved</a> in 2024 amidst wider cuts at a tough time for the embattled publisher, which recently entered into a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-makes-major-deal-that-will-focus-on-three-game-franchises/1100-6530434/">partnership with Tencent</a>.</p>

Tharpe highlighted how the film stood out in the superhero genre by striking an honest tone unique to the Superman ethos.</p><p>“Gunn’s approach is colorful, in both its palette and the costumes; proudly fantastical, with flying orbs, robots, portals, and giant monsters; and at times endearingly, intentionally corny (see: Krypto the super dog). But late in the third act, Superman delivers an impassioned monologue about himself that essentially states Gunn’s thesis about the character and his core values. You won’t find any controversial neck-snapping here.”</p><p>A large swath of critics applauded Gunn’s bold choice to ground <em>Superman</em> in political tensions, using the conflict between two warring countries—Boravia and Jarhanpur—as a central plot point. <em>New York Times</em> movie critic Alissa Wilkinson <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/08/movies/superman-review.html&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/07/08/movies/superman-review.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">noted in her review</a></span> that her own superhero movie fatigue was no match for <em>Superman</em>’s goofy yet sincere take on the Man of Steel. <em>Vulture</em> critic Alison Willmore, meanwhile, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.vulture.com/article/review-james-gunns-superman-cant-help-but-be-political.html&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.vulture.com/article/review-james-gunns-superman-cant-help-but-be-political.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">emphasized</a></span> that the hero is “the creation of two Jewish American men whose families fled the pogroms and who gave their extraterrestrial defender of the planet a background as a refugee himself.” To her, this somewhat politicized superhero film is a welcomed reflection of our world, and our real-life supervillains.</p><p>At the time o this article’s release, the movie holds an impressive <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/superman_2025&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/superman_2025" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">86 percent approval rating</a></span> on Rotten Tomatoes, with journalists like <em>Associated Press</em> film critic Jake Coyle calling it “something quite rare in the assembly line-style of superhero moviemaking today: human.” That feeling of being reminded why many of us fell in love with comic books in the first place was a common sentiment among those who enjoyed it. To them, <em>Superman</em> was a trip back to their unjaded, zealous youth, when a man leaping tall buildings in a single bound still amazed them.</p><p>Unfortunately, all is not well in Metropolis. A number of critics took issue with what they see as the film’s uninspired plot, lackluster performances by some of the cast, and Krypto, Superman’s adorable dog, outshining some of the human characters. Peter Bradshaw of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/jul/08/superman-review-david-corenswet-james-gunn&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/jul/08/superman-review-david-corenswet-james-gunn" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>The Guardian</em></a></span> didn’t pull any punches when he characterized Corenswet’s performance as “square-faced soullessness,” and derided the movie for its “pointless and cluttered new backstory.” Even some critics who enjoyed the film felt that it had its share of issues. <em>Variety</em>’s Owen Gleiberman placed the movie in his “<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://variety.com/2025/film/reviews/superman-review-james-gunn-david-corenswet-1236444126/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://variety.com/2025/film/reviews/superman-review-james-gunn-david-corenswet-1236444126/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">next-level good</a></span>” tier alongside movies like <em>Batman Begins</em>, <em>Iron Man</em>, and <em>Thor</em>, But, due to what he sees as <em>Superman</em>’s busy cluttered pacing sometimes preventing the film from slowing down and giving the characters moments of growth and reflection, it fell short of the lofty perch of <em>The Dark Knight</em> and 1980s <em>Superman II </em>for him. </p><p>A few others had much harsher critiques.</p><p>I can almost guarantee Gunn couldn’t care less about the negative reactions, though.

			<p>You might not be able to sandwalk like a Fremen in Dune: Awakening, but there are ways of getting around Arrakis besides your own two feet, including fast travel. </p>



<p>It's not immediately obvious that fast travel is in Dune: Awakening, but it is there. You don't need to use it, though, and there's a real question as to whether you should be using it at all. </p>



<p>This guide will take you through all of that; how fast travel works, where it can take you, and if you should be using it at all.</p>



<h2 id="h-dune-awakening-guide-how-fast-travel-works">Dune: Awakening Guide - How Fast Travel Works</h2>



<h3 id="h-how-fast-travel-works-in-dune-awakening">How Fast Travel Works in Dune: Awakening</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>Unlike other open-world games with large maps to cross, you cannot fast travel whenever you like in Dune: Awakening. It's only available when you make it to your first trade post in the southern region of Hagga Basin. </p>



<p>You can fast travel from any trade post, but it only unlocks once you've reached the first one, Griffin's Reach. Fast travel works by hiring a pilot to fly you to Harko Village, the Harkonnen base on Arrakis, or Arrakeen, the city where the Atreides have taken refuge. Both areas are social hubs where you can meet other players, though more significantly, they house plenty of important NPCs you need to speak to, like advanced-level trainers for Trooper and Mentat skill trees.</p>



<p>It'll cost you 2,500 Solaris for the pilot to fly you to either Harko Village or Arrakeen, but at least your return trip to whichever trade post you'd like to fly back to will be free. The pilot will also be able to fly you to different trade posts in Hagga Basin, such as the Anvil or Pinnacle Station, though there's still a cost to that. A more reasonable 700 Solaris will get you between different trade posts. </p>



<p>You also can't use the pilot to fly you to a trade post you've not been to before. You have to make it there yourself by some other means before being able to fast travel from one trade post to another.</p>



<h3 id="h-should-you-use-fast-travel-in-dune-awakening">Should You Use Fast Travel in Dune: Awakening?</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>There are two answers to this question, and the one that's right for you depends on where you are in the game. Basically, if you have yet to craft your own ornithopter, then yes, you should be using fast travel, though that's also because you have to. You can't access Arrakeen or Harko Village any other way, save for landing there with an ornithopter.</p>



<p>If you have already crafted your own ornithopter, then you don't need to use the pilot, and you can select travelling to Arrakeen or Harko Village as a form of fast travel, since there's no other way to access either settlement.</p>



<p>When you're going from one trade post to another, unless you're immediately near a trade post and have the 700 Solaris to spare, you might find it better to just get there yourself, especially if you have your own ornithopter. Being able to fly anywhere at any time is the *real* fast travel in Dune: Awakening.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">A consumer rights watchdog in Brazil has launched a legal challenge against Nintendo for its policy of "bricking" the consoles of users who violate the console's terms of service. This policy is a new addition to Nintendo's user agreement. The change took effect on May 7, just a month before the Nintendo Switch 2 launched. Procon-SP, the São Paulo branch of the Brazilian Consumer Protection and Defense Program, has raised a complaint with Nintendo itself, claiming the policy violates consumer rights.</p><p dir="ltr">Via <a dir="ltr" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/as-nintendos-ability-to-ban-switch-2-consoles-from-online-services-sparks-headlines-brazils-consumer-rights-watchdog-issues-legal-challenge" rel="noreferrer nofollow ">IGN</a>, reports of "bricked" consoles have emerged since the Switch 2's launch. Affected users have speculated that bans result from the use of flash memory cards generally, and the MIG Switch device in particular, both of which can be used for piracy. A bricked console cannot access the internet and will display the error code 2124-4508. The ban encompasses paid online features like GameChat and online multiplayer, but also unpaid ones, like downloading patches or verifying Game-Key carts.</p><p dir="ltr">Furthermore, it is the console itself that is banned, not just the user account of the offender. This means that purchasing a Switch 2 secondhand could result in buying a "bricked" console, one that cannot access any of the console's online features. According to IGN, this has already happened. Nintendo has stated that such a ban is permanent.</p><p dir="ltr">According to <a dir="ltr" href="https://www.procon.sp.gov.br/nintendo-procon-sp-cobra-mudancas-contratuais-e-alerta-para-riscos-de-empresas-sem-representacao-no-brasil/" rel="noreferrer nofollow ">Procon-SP's statement</a>, Nintendo has agreed to respond to the claim within 20 days. The organization encourages Brazilian consumers to log their bans on the watchdog's official website while it waits on Nintendo's response.</p><p dir="ltr">In other Nintendo Switch 2 news, the company has responded to concerns that <a dir="ltr" href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-addresses-concerns-over-switch-2s-price-keeping-kids-from-getting-it/1100-6532994/">the console's price point would be a barrier to younger fans</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>If, like me, you’ve noticed an uptick in anime girls with horse ears running around your social media timeline, you might be confused as to what the hell is going on. The game causing all this commotion, my friends, is <em>Umamusume: Pretty Derby</em>,<em> </em>a gacha game that has finally made its way to the West after originally launching in Japan back in 2021. The game is based on the titular media franchise in which racehorses are reincarnated as literal horse girls who do what racehorses do best, just as bipedal humans with horse ears on their heads. Given that there are dozens of horse girls in the series, the premise is ripe for a gacha game in which people gamble to unlock their favorite. But what do you do when you’ve got them? The same thing you’d do with a regular racehorse, of course: train them to be the very best.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197589" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Ring Psychology: Understanding The 6 Phases Of A Wrestling Match Through Heel Era John Cena" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="659" data-playlist="197589,197586,197585" data-current="197589"><div><p>Ring Psychology: Understanding The 6 Phases Of A Wrestling Match Through Heel Era John Cena</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197589/197589_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197589/197589_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197589/197589_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/23110.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Like a lot of people, I had never heard of <em>Umamusume Pretty Derby </em>before the game’s launch in this part of the world last week. Despite its preposterous premise, the game plays its horse girl races pretty straight and with the kind of gusto and earnest determination you’d expect from any sports anime. As the girls run around the track, there’s spirited commentary, rivalries, and narratives unfolding. If I didn’t see that the girls had horse ears on their heads, I wouldn’t know it wasn’t just a straightforward racing show. Well, at least I wouldn’t until after the girls have crossed the finish line, at which point they put on an idol concert for a crowd of adoring fans. Sure, pop off, queens.</p><p>After <em>Umamusume </em>draws you in with all the glitz and glamour, it does what every one of these games does and bombards you with menus, currencies, and random drops. When I started to navigate these abundant, colorful menus, they crashed my iPhone 12. Maybe it’s time for an upgrade. Wait, is the horse girl gacha game going to get me to an AT&amp;T store to join modern times? What an odd turn of events.</p><p>Anyway, these random drops come in two forms: trainees and support cards. The former are the actual horse girls you’ll be training; the rest are supplementary cards that will give your primary character a boost. Each horse girl has a career that, once completed, allows them to be registered as a Veteran Umamusume and Legacy character, in order to grant stat boosts and other perks to other characters. So you can see how the grind feeds into itself and incentivizes you to train several racers rather than just your favorites. </p><p>When you get set up in your career, parts of the game feel more like playing with a digital pet than I expected. Each girl has different goals, requiring different training regimens to make progress in their story. You’ll also monitor their energy levels, interact with other students at the horse girl academy, and eventually, you’ll send her off to the races. The only real input you get into the competitions themselves is the training you put your horse girl through and the game plan you give her ahead of time. You can make some strategic decisions, like telling her to prioritize pacing herself instead of sprinting like her life depends on it, but the optimal strat is determined by the stats she’s gained through training ahead of races, Ultimately, your goal is to set her up for success; if you were hoping for a more direct racing game, you will not find that here.</p><p>All that being said, there’s potential here for some real sicko grinding and optimizing your racer’s stats, especially as you import legacy characters to boost those attributes and collect support cards through drops. It can make going through the careers feel almost like a rogue-like run in which you try to figure out the best build to claim victory. I see the various hooks <em>Umamusume </em>has lowered into the sea, and while I know the kind of people who gravitate towards these kinds of games might bite,&nbsp;I don’t know if the bait is quite to my liking, personally.&nbsp;I still find its barrage of mechanics and menus overwhelming, though, and there isn’t much else here pulling me in, so I don’t think I’ll be staring into the abyss long enough to get caught up in the gacha mechanics here. Gacha games are all about risk and reward, and I don’t think its wacky concept is enough reward for the risk of opening myself to gambling.</p><p>After spending a couple of hours with <em>Umamusume</em>, its bizarre premise seems to be the most compelling thing it has going for it. It’s got plenty of the drawbacks of other gacha games on the market: full of currencies that you can purchase for ungodly amounts of real-world money, rewards incentivizing you to log in every day, enough menus to overstimulate anyone who dares to install it, and character design so generic I couldn’t identify any of these girls in a line-up with a gun to my head. Lucky for it, the thing that makes it stand out is a memetic absurdist premise that helps it pierce through the oversaturated gacha market. It’s nothing groundbreaking, but it’s just silly enough to <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.vice.com/en/article/umamusume-pretty-derby-breaks-all-time-player-count-record-on-steam-after-twitch-streamers-discover-horse-waifu-racing-game/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/umamusume-pretty-derby-breaks-all-time-player-count-record-on-steam-after-twitch-streamers-discover-horse-waifu-racing-game/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">catch the eye of those who aren’t usually paying attention</a></span>.

                <p>Twenty years ago at E3 2005, Sony showed off a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/killzone-2-review/1900-6205274/" data-ref-id="1900-6205274">Killzone 2</a> video as an example of the PlayStation 3's power over its rival console, Microsoft's Xbox 360. However, Sony later admitted that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/inside-the-killzone/1100-6304486/" data-ref-id="1100-6304486">the Killzone 2 video wasn't actually gameplay footage</a> and that it was meant to be a "target render" for the team to achieve. Now, former Xbox boss Peter Moore has shared that he knew all along that the Killzone 2 demo was "BS."</p><p>While speaking with <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/when-xbox-took-on-playstation-and?utm_medium=email" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Game Business</a>, Moore recalled that Sony pulled a similar trick to outshine the Dreamcast when he worked for Sega. Sony essentially tried to adopt the strategy a second time to overshadow Xbox 360's launch.</p>

<p>"It was exactly the same tactics of creating a very expensive movie," said Moore. "But when the game came out, it was completely BS. I knew it that night when I watched it. I thought there's no way they're delivering this experience. They were doing the same thing to us as they did with Sega, which is go: 'Alright, cute little Xbox 360 coming out, but the big boys will be out with the PlayStation 3, so you should hang around and wait for that. Because look what we can do.'"</p><p>According to Moore, game journalists also recognized Sony's strategy and quickly came to the conclusion that the PS3 wasn't powerful enough to produce that level of detail in real-time.</p><p>Moore went on to describe Microsoft's strategic rollout of Xbox 360, and added that landing the console-exclusive rights for Call of Duty 2 went a long way towards the company's success.</p><p>In the present, Call of Duty remains the most-successful <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-fps-games/2900-6265/" data-ref-id="2900-6265">FPS</a> franchise, which is now owned by Microsoft after the Activision Blizzard sale.

The news caps off an incredible run for SGA, as he was not only a key part of the 2024-2025 NBA championship-winning Thunder but also league MVP, Finals MVP, and scoring champion.</p><p>Gilgeous-Alexander joined the NBA in 2018, when he was drafted 11th overall by the Charlotte Hornets. He was traded that same day to the Los Angeles Clippers, where he played for one year and was named to the NBA All-Rookie Second Team. In July 2019, Gilgeous-Alexander was traded to the Oklahoma City Thunder, where he has played since. Since that trade, SGA has been named to three All-Star Teams and three All-NBA First Teams. The Toronto-born star also took home the 2023 Lionel Conacher Award, given to Canada’s male athlete of the year.</p>

He joined The Verge in 2019 after nearly two years at Techmeme.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Amazon finally has listings for the Nintendo Switch 2 in the US – though right now, you can only register your interest for an <em>invitation</em> to purchase a console. If you’re interested, here are links to the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FC5FJZ9Z?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">console and <em>Mario Kart World</em> bundle</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0F3GWXLTS?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">the console on its own</a>.</p><p>It’s a big change following Nintendo removing listings for its products from Amazon starting last year. <em>Bloomberg</em> reported <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-06-30/amazon-lost-right-to-sell-nintendo-switch-2-amid-sales-dispute?embedded-checkout=true">in June</a> that Nintendo pulled the listings because third-party sellers sold games at prices “that undercut Nintendo’s advertised rates.” Nintendo and Amazon pushed back on <em>Bloomberg’s</em> report in statements to the publication but didn’t go into specifics.</p><p>However, there have been signs that something had changed between Nintendo and Amazon, with Switch 2 games like <em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em>, <em>Super Mario Party Jamboree</em>, and <em>Kirby and the Forgotten Land</em> <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:knj5sw5al3sukl6vhkpi7637/post/3lrk3nx4nfy2z?ref_src=embed">all recently getting official Amazon product pages</a>.</p><p>If you request an Amazon invite, the product page will show a message saying that “if invited to purchase, you’ll get an email with a link that’s valid for 22 hours. We won’t be able to grant all requests.” I got an email notifying me about my request, too.</p><p>The Switch 2 has been a huge hit for Nintendo, becoming the fastest-selling game console of all time <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/685162/nintendo-switch-2-sales-figures-record">since its June 5th launch</a>. If you are still looking for a console and Amazon doesn’t come through, retailers like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/685578/nintendo-switch-2-restock-walmart-availability">Walmart</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/695273/nintendo-switch-2-in-store-restock-best-buy">Best Buy</a> have occasional restocks.</p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/701385/amazon-nintendo-switch-2-listings]]></content:encoded>
