		<p>Hanging upside down for any length of time is a pretty bad time, and as our hands on with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/resident-evil-9-requiem">Resident Evil Requiem</a> begins and we see Grace Ashcroft struggling to free herself from a tilted gurney and remove the cannula from her arm, it’s pretty clear that she wasn’t having much fun there. What awaits in our first hands on demo is another exemplary slice of modern Resident Evil horror.</p>
<p><iframe title="Resident Evil Requiem Preview" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pIE471UnNVc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>FBI agent Grace Ashcroft has found herself in dire straights after being sent to investigate a series of strange deaths at a hotel where her mother died almost a decade before. Just like Ethan in Resi 7, she’s a very different protagonist to series staples like Leon Kennedy or Chris Redfield, both having grown into being ultra-competent fighters of big bad monsters. Grace feels completely out of her depth, simply doing anything that she can to survive, using basic FBI desk jockey training and nous.</p>


<p>So what does face her? Well, a creepy, poorly lit hotel, it seems. Venturing out after quickly interacting with everything possible – the medical machine, the pool of blood Grace has left behind, the written note – and what immediately starts to stand out is this interplay between light and dark. While this first room is brightly lit, you can flick on and off the room light and a small table light, completely changing the tone of the room as you do so.</p>


<p>The hallway outside, meanwhile, is bathed in an eerie red glow and, making our way to what looks like a kitchen area and finding the light switch reveals just a portion of the space with a harsh flickering light. Exploring further down the hallway, there’s further pools of light and dark, adding greatly to the sense of foreboding.</p>
<p>What’s nice and fun through this are the little nods and winks to Resident Evil and the genre in general. A locked door needs a key, a locked gate has a missing fuse, and there’s things like empty typewriter tape cases and green herbs to find while interacting with everything possible. The main things we find of actual use are a couple empty bottles and a lighter that gives us independence from what the switches and working lights dictate.</p>
<p>This leads us to the big scary moment, the lighter letting us reach a door that was previously practically impossible to reach in the pitched darkness – Grace isn’t a Vin Diesel type with night vision –&nbsp;triggering the reveal of the huge monster that will stalk her through the game.</p>

<p>This is such a classic staple of the Resident Evil series, but it’s still such a thrill to have the monster revealed and endlessly hunt us down. After Lady Dimitrescu got everyone so freakin’ thirsty for taller ladies in Village, I’m not sure that Resident Evil Requiem will have quite the same effect, but I love just how large the monster is, barely able to fit through the doorways and rooms, and giving me a bit of a Little Nightmares feel for the dramatic size disparity.</p>
<p>All that Grace can do is hide, wait, try to be quiet while searching for a screwdriver –&nbsp;this needed us to move a trolley around to stand on, which could knock things off and make noise, but I was delighted to lure the monster to this room and have her smash the trolley around in a surprisingly helpful way – and then try to avoid the monster as she stomps after you. It’s clear that, especially through a close encounter, Grace is absolutely terrified by this, but this only truly becomes apparent when playing in third person as opposed to first person.</p>

<p>We’ve seen Capcom retrofit third person views into Resident Evil Village, but Requiem will have the option available to you from day one, and it’s clear that Capcom has put a lot of effort in to make them both feel as good as possible. There’s definitely a different tone to evading the monster when in first person, having the narrowed view of the world and tentatively holding a lighter in front of you for illumination, hiding under tables more cautiously approaching corners, and generally being wrapped up in the more claustrophobic nature of the view. Third person brings us more of an action horror tone, lightly diluting some of the terror, perhaps, but there’s so much nuance to the character animation this time around.</p>
<p>Should the monster burst through a wall or after a tense and fraught cutscene, Grace’s movements are much more frantic, she staggers and stumbles while hurrying away, adding a bit more depth to her characterisation that isn’t quite so feasible when playing in first person. I honestly can’t quite decide whether I’d prefer to play in first or third person at this point, but Requiem has a great shot at really catering to lovers of both styles or past Resi games.</p>
<p>Either way, though, there is that use of light and dark. The monster, it turns out, doesn’t really appreciate bright spaces, and you can use that to your advantage. If you’re unable to get past her through the corridors, you can draw her back to the starting room, switch the light off to bring her inside, and then skirt around the furniture to evade and escape her. It’s just one of a number of options, though. I saw others able to just tuck themselves deep into a dark corner and evade, but I guess I was a touch impatient!</p>

<p>Resident Evil Requiem promises another new beginning for the iconic horror franchise, but it’s still one that’s deeply tied to the series’ past. There’s plenty of tropes here, plenty of references back to the original games, and gameplay ideas that will be familiar, but from my brief hands on with the game, there’s still so, so much to be excited about.</p>
<p>Resident Evil Requiem is launching on 27th February 2026 for PS5, Xbox Series X|S and PC, and we can’t wait to see more.</p>

<p>I hate this wait</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Skybound Entertainment and Broken Mirror Games have announced that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/i_hate_this_place">I Hate This Place</a>, the adaptation of the comic series from writer Kyle Starks and artist Artyom Topilin, will launch on the Switch on <strong>7th November 2025</strong>.</p>
<p>The new trailer also gives us a further glimpse at the craft-based survival horror gameplay, with an isometric viewpoint and cool, stylised visuals paying homage to the comic itself. Developer Broken Mirror Games was founded in 2024 and sits under the larger Bloober Team, which itself is shortly launching <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/cronos-the-new-dawn">Cronos: The New Dawn</a> on the Switch 2. These folks are all about the horror!</p>
<p>So let's remind ourselves of the key features:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Classic Craft-Based Survival Horror</strong> – Scavenge every corner of Rutherford Ranch to stay alive. From haunted forests, a derelict town, to infested bunkers. Explore a world teeming with danger as you gather vital resources, craft essential gear, upgrade your campsite, and rebuild outposts to have somewhere to hide.</p>
<p><strong>Day Prepares You. Night Hunts You</strong> – A dynamic day-night cycle that changes the world. Use daylight wisely to explore, scavenge supplies, craft what you need, and prepare for what’s coming. When night falls, the real nightmares come out to play. More enemies appear, stronger and more aggressive than before. The landscape becomes harder to navigate with just your flashlight. Sometimes your best hope is to find shelter and hunker down till morning.</p>
<p><strong>Deadly Silence Goes A Long Way</strong> – Stealth and combat go hand-in-hand here as many of the twisted creatures in Rutherford Ranch hunt and stalk you by sound alone. Brute force will often just land you in an early grave. Use sound to your advantage, luring creatures away from your path or cleverly leading them straight into deadly traps you laid.</p>
<p><strong>80s Vibes Meets Comic Book Flair</strong> – Inspired by the award-nominated comic book series, <em>I Hate This Place</em> comes to life with bold colors, a punchy retro comic book style, and a heavy dose of ’80s flair. A unique blend of horror, dark humor, and just the right touch of camp and gore where unsettling dread meets stylized charm.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/console-wars-review-exploding-kittens-for-video-game-nerds</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I love getting stuck into a deep board game with friends, but that doesn't mean that every board game night should require a lot from you. <em>Console Wars</em> is a new video game nerd-themed party game where each player is trying to build up their portfolio of popular video games, poach titles from others, and accumulate a massive fanbase. Every turn has a chance to swing the tides of play, making it a fun and engaging experience for all, whether it's your turn or not.</p>

<p>The aim of <em>Console Wars</em> is to end up having four completed Genre Sets on your table. Each genre is comprised of familiar, but legally distinct takes on some of your favorite video games. While you're seeking to build up your own video game empire, you're also working to steal games from others and poach their fanbases. It's a 3-5 player tongue-in-cheek game of tug of war from start to finish.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/console-wars-review-fanbase.jpg?itok=crWVr7p0 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/console-wars-review-fanbase.jpg?itok=rwar3KMn 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h2>Setting Up <em>Console Wars</em></h2>

<p>Inside the <em>Console Wars</em> box, you'll see a set of instructions and a whole lot of cards. You'll end up with a larger main deck of cards that consists of game cards, action cards, and fanbase cards. Then you'll have an additional pile of Perk Cards (with blue backs) and Global Event Cards (with pink backs).</p>

<p>Simple enough, every player gets five of the standard cards, a perk card, and three Global Event Cards are shuffled into the deck. From there, the simple goal is for each player to play three cards a turn and be the first to create four complete genre sets.</p>

<h2>Build Up Your Defense, While Attacking</h2>

<p>The core of <em>Console Wars</em> is that you want to keep yourself protected while launching attacks at other players around the table.</p>

<p>While players are always trying to steal each other's game franchises, they do this by demanding fandom, the currency of the game, and if you don't have enough loose fans you'll need to pay in the game franchises that you have on your field.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/console-wars-review-deck-setup.jpg?itok=T4KcbUoL 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/console-wars-review-deck-setup.jpg?itok=wWGytsH- 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Each turn, you will draw two cards while getting to play three. Looking around the board, you can see whether it's worth moving yourself towards the goal of completing a set, playing cards to your fanbase to stay protected, or playing action cards to try to steal your opponents' fanbase or games.</p>

<h2>The Game Is Always Moving</h2>

<p>Immediately, you'll find yourself having a fun time as each player around the table reveals fun parody cards of well-known franchises. It keeps players engaged during the early setup phases while players are getting the stakes set on the board.</p>

<p>Something I loved about the action cards was that a large number of them weren't just antagonistic to one player across the table, but antagonistic to all. Every player needed to be paying attention to see when they'd have to be prepared to block, or all lose cards to the active player.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/console-wars-review-genre-games.jpg?itok=WN3qwnMl 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/console-wars-review-genre-games.jpg?itok=MekreVlV 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The two aspects that make this game really successful is that the rules are pretty light, all printed on the cards, and that everyone can always be engaged. It's not a game where you'll have a chance to zone out, but because the topic is always light hearted the game is always fun.</p>

<h2><em>Console Wars</em> Review | Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>I went into <em>Console Wars</em> unsure of what to expect, and in the best way possible, I got to experience what is '<em>Exploding Kittens</em> for Video Game fans'. <em>Console Wars</em> does an incredible job at making the game easy and accessible to everyone, pays homage to the great video game franchises in a cheeky way, and is fun to play whether it's your turn or not.</p>

<p><em>Console Wars</em> is a game that I'm looking forward to playing not just with my board game friends, but with casual entertainment friends, and more.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 has been revealed, and details have been shared for the upcoming Open Beta, where players will get the first opportunity to get their hands on the title. Here’s everything we know.</p>



<p>The Black Ops 7 Open Beta is split into two parts, with the first few days available only to those with Early Access before the doors open for everyone, and it’s the perfect time to try out the title before the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-releases-november-14/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">November 14</a> release.</p>



<p>In the guide below, we’ve outlined all of the crucial information for the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-access-black-ops-7-beta-pre-order-bonuses/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Open Beta</a>, including the dates, how to sign-up, and what you can expect.</p>



<h2 id="h-black-ops-7-open-beta-start-date">Black Ops 7 Open Beta Start Date</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Squad up. Image via Activision</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>The Black Ops 7 Open Beta begins on October 5, though three days of Early Access are available from October 2.</strong></p>



<p>These dates have been confirmed by <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/games/store/call-of-duty-black-ops-7/9PLBM5790L94" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">store listings</a> for Black Ops 7 pre-orders, though it’s worth noting that the dates are subject to change.</p>



<p>No end date has been revealed yet for the Black Ops 6 Open Beta, though expect things to wrap up before the release of Battlefield 6 on October 10, as Activision understandably won’t want the timings to clash.</p>



<p>If any further details are announced regarding the beta, we’ll add to this article.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-sign-up-for-black-ops-7-open-beta">How to Sign Up For Black Ops 7 Open Beta</h2>



<p><strong>Pre-ordering Black Ops 7 or having an active Game Pass subscription qualifies you for Early Access to the Beta from October 2.</strong></p>



<p>From October 5, however, the doors open for all players and there are no entry restrictions, so you won’t need to pre-order. As we don’t know exactly how long the Open Beta will be live for, though, it could leave you with very limited time to try it out before the doors close.</p>



<p>No further Betas are expected after the Open Beta before launch on November 14, with the title once again included with an Xbox Game Pass subscription.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-to-expect-from-black-ops-7-open-beta">What to Expect From Black Ops 7 Open Beta</h2>



<p><strong>The Black Ops 7 Open Beta will be Multiplayer only, so you won’t be able to try out Zombies, the Campaign, or Warzone.</strong></p>



<p>Full details of what’s included are not yet revealed, though there could be a limited amount of guns available and only a select few maps and game modes in rotation.</p>



<p>Any progress earned in the Beta will not transfer over to Black Ops 7 at launch, though there may be some exclusive bonuses to unlock for participating.</p>



<p>Are you planning to pre-order Black Ops 7 to secure Early Access to the Beta? Let us know in the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <p>2K have laid off an unspecified number of staff at <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/cloud-chamber">Cloud Chamber</a>, amid efforts to rework <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/bioshock-4">BioShock 4</a>. These cuts come at the same time former Diablo lead Rod Fergusson joins as Cloud Chamber's new studio head, taking up the position recently vacated by Kelley Gilmore.</p>
<p>A <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2k-comment-on-reports-bioshock-4-is-in-trouble-we-have-a-good-game-but-we-are-committed-to-delivering-a-great-one">report from Bloomberg earlier this month</a> revealed that the game had failed an internal progress check. Gilmore and creative director Hogarth de la Plante reportedly moved into different jobs as part of a resulting leadership shakeup. Despite all of this, Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ok-is-not-ok-good-is-bad-great-is-the-new-great-and-bioshock-4-is-coming-out-as-take-two-boss-stops-short-of-claiming-that-up-is-down">has insisted</a>, amid chatting some nonsense about great being the new great, that the game will still make it to release.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>That brings us to yesterday, when Bloomberg's Jason Schrier reported that Cloud Chamber were letting folks go as they announced Fergusson's impending arrival. <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bioshock-studio-cloud-chamber-undergoes-layoffs-appoints-rod-fergusson-new-bioshock-head">IGN</a> report that 2K haven't said how many employees have been affected by the cuts, while publishing part of an email to staff from 2K president David Ismailer that aims to explain the reasoning behind them.</p>
<p>"Work on the next <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/bioshock">BioShock</a> game has been underway for several years," it reads. "While we’re excited about the foundational gameplay elements of the project, we’ve made the decision with studio leadership to rework certain aspects that are core to a BioShock game, and in doing so are reducing the size of the development team to focus on this work and give the game more time in development."</p>
<blockquote data-bluesky-cid="bafyreichplln4sgf4f2jj53wecaj2v4u6rct7ffccllsouwozyzsmtrexe" data-bluesky-embed-color-mode="system" data-bluesky-uri="at://did:plc:2mkgbhbhqvappkkorf2bzyrp/app.bsky.feed.post/3lwr7jxitg22z"><p lang="en">BREAKING: BioShock 4 developer Cloud Chamber is laying off an unspecified number of staff.

Also, former Diablo boss Rod Fergusson is taking over as Cloud Chamber's new studio head. More than a decade ago, he joined the troubled BioShock Infinite and helped salvage that game's production.</p>— Jason Schreier (<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:2mkgbhbhqvappkkorf2bzyrp?ref_src=embed">@jasonschreier.bsky.social</a>) <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:2mkgbhbhqvappkkorf2bzyrp/post/3lwr7jxitg22z?ref_src=embed">19 August 2025 at 16:18</a></blockquote><p><span data-type="targeting">

</span></p><p>The email reportedly concluded with Ismailer describing the multiple people losing their livelihoods and the hiring of one guy as making for a "day of mixed emotions", before going full exec rah-rah speech about the state of BioShock. "These changes are rooted in 2K’s firm confidence in BioShock as one of the most beloved franchises, and our commitment to deliver the best game in franchise history," he declared.</p>
<p>I've reached out to 2K for comment.</p>
<p>As for what the future looks like for BioShock 4, it's clear why 2K have gone for ex-Blizzard man Fergusson. The veteran developer was previously brought in at Irrational games to help get 2013’s <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/bioshock-infinite">BioShock Infinite</a> out of the door, having done the same for the likes of Gears of War.</p>
<p>Best of luck to the staff Cloud Chamber have let go.</p>

We got a tiny peek at some more gameplay in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/round-up-gamescom-opening-night-live-2025-every-switch-1-and-2-announcement-and-trailer">Gamescom Opening Night Live</a>, Team Cherry revealed a "<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/hollow-knight-silksong-special-announcement-is-coming-this-thursday">special announcement</a>" is coming on Thursday, and now we're getting to go hands-on with the damn thing.</p>
<p>Our more detailed impressions will be coming your way soon enough, but we thought it only right to highlight the game's impressive Switch 2 performance right off the bat: this thing has a mode that supports 120Hz!</p>
<p>Yes, after our brief time with the game, we can confirm that those playing on Switch 2 will be able to explore the all-new kingdom with quite possibly the most frames that the console can muster — talk about buttery smoothness.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067jxlvhy&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

</figcaption></figure></div>
<p>This increased frame rate falls under the game's 'TV Mode', which boasts a "higher frame rate mode for displays that support 120Hz," though resolution is reduced in the process.</p>
<p>This is a real treat. Now, to be clear, just because the game <em>supports</em> higher frame rates, that doesn't mean it'll necessarily <em>play</em> at 120fps — we'll need further testing to know for sure. But there's room for the upper reaches of the Switch 2, and what we played felt super smooth.</p>
<p>Remember, the Switch 2's capacity for 120fps was one of the big selling points out of the console's reveal Direct, though we haven't seen it used all that often since launch. Select indies like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/handy-hockey">Handy Hockey</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mina-the-hollower">Mina the Hollower</a> have put it into practice, and who can forget its implementation in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/nintendo-switch-2-welcome-tour">Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour</a>... we did. The next big hitter that we had our eyes on for 120fps gameplay was <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/metroid-prime-4-beyond-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a> (whenever that ends up releasing), so it's nice to hear that Silksong will be accompanying it in the meantime.</p>
<p>All eyes on Thursday's "special announcement" for more information and <em>hopefully</em> a release date.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2">Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2</a> got <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-finally-has-a-full-release-date-plus-a-bloody-good-new-trailer">a full release date</a> during <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gamescom-opening-night-live-2025-livestream-watch-all-todays-announcements-here">Gamescom Opening Night Live</a> last night, along with a fresh trailer. However, there's one detail that might put a bit of a dampener [<em>dhampir</em>? - Ed] on your claret-tinged celebrations about the game finally overcoming its many bloody delays.</p>
<p>You see, while the base version of Bloodlines 2 offers four vampire clans with different playstyles for you to get behind the fangs of, Paradox have opted to stick a further two behind paid day-one DLC.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>This pair of clans are the Toreador and the Lasombra, and to get them, you'll need to invest in Bloodlines 2's £74.99/€89.99/$89.99 premium edition, or pay an extra £18.69/€21.99/$21.99 to add the Shadows and Silk DLC pack to your base or deluxe edition. If you opt not to pony up that cash, you will still be able to pick between the Brujah, Tremere, Banu Haqim, and Ventrue clans, but yeah, not ideal.</p>
<p>Especially since both premium clans aren't just swankier looks you'll be able to don. They've each got their own unique abilities, which one has to assume will make a difference to how your playthrough goes and feels. "Embrace the shadows as a Lasombra, commanding the very essence of darkness to bend to your will," reads the Shadows and Silk DLC's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1048512/Vampire_The_Masquerade__Bloodlines_2__Shadows__Silk/">Steam blurb</a>. "Or, revel in beauty and passion as a Toreador, channeling your artistic spirit to captivate and influence those around you."</p><p>Yep, that's right, the Toreador are otherwise known as the "clan of divas", and are your best shot to play a sexy seducer who probably resembles <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/baldurs-gate-3-class-list">Baldur's Gate 3</a>'s Astarion if he were kicked through the uber-risqué section of a gothic outfitter. Or, to put it another way, Astarion in 90% of modded BG3 playthroughs. The base game's Ventrue also look to have the hobnobbing with high society element to them, but they're a bit more buttoned up. There's more info on the <a href="https://www.paradoxinteractive.com/games/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2/clans/toreador">Toreador</a> and <a href="https://www.paradoxinteractive.com/games/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2/clans/lasombra">Lasombra</a> clans' abilities on Paradox's website.</p>
<p>I've asked Paradox for comment. Charging separately for vampire clans seems a risky decision for a game like Bloodlines 2, which already faces the task of convincing Vampire fans it's worthy of its <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bloodlines-2-is-more-spiritual-successor-than-sequel-to-a-a-competently-good-game-by-2004-standards-say-paradox">spiritual successor label</a>, as well as turning around any cynicism that's understandably crept into folks' minds throughout its <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-is-back-and-now-under-development-by-dear-esther-studio">turbulent development</a>.</p>

I'll be doing individual write-ups for a lot of these games, but I'll also be writing condensed quick-hit thoughts on the coolest games I've played so far, and you can read them right here (so bookmark this page, folks!).&nbsp;</p><p>Below, you'll find a running list of the games I've played during Gamescom 2025.

<p>It's real, y'all. Hollow Knight: Silksong exists and is playable, and I checked out the game's very first level, Moss Grotto. After a brief cutscene that shows Hornet trapped in a Cinderella-like carriage (that she then breaks out of), I take control. Immediately, Hornet is much faster than the first game's protagonist, both as she platforms around and with her attacks. She has a new ability called Bind (used by pressing B on an Xbox controller) that heals her. However, you can't spam this ability as it requires using a bar on screen that must be full.&nbsp;</p><p>It recharges over time and by defeating enemies, and I found it pretty easy to get it full for another Bind. Platforming around Moss Grotto feels a lot like 2017's Hollow Knight, though Hornet is more nimble and can mantle up cliffs and platforms. The enemies here are easy to defeat, and it's not until I fight the demo's boss, Moss Mother, that I'm challenged. It's a fun fight, but still mostly easy.&nbsp;</p><p>With the demo and my hands-on time with Silksong behind me, I'm excited to see what else awaits me in the full game. If this first level is any indication, it's going to be a great Metroidvania, much like the first game. That said, I'm not convinced it's going to break through the hype and make a mark on the genre like the first game did. I'm also not convinced it needs to, though.&nbsp;</p><p>For more, <a href="https://gameinformer.com/gamescom-2025/2025/08/20/we-played-the-first-level-of-hollow-knight-silksong-heres-what-we-think">read my full Hollow Knight: Silksong hands-on thoughts here</a>.&nbsp;</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/gamescom-2025/2025/08/20/the-most-dope-games-weve-played-during-gamescom-2025]]></content:encoded>

<p>"Did I startle you..?"</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>Although many deemed it somewhat tedious, sailing across The Great Sea is what made <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/legend_of_zelda_the_wind_waker">Zelda: The Wind Waker</a>, well... <em>The Wind Waker</em>.</p>
<p>It was a really cool mechanic in hindsight, and we don't know about you, but we often fantasised about having our own 'King of the Red Lions' sailboat in real life. Now, thanks to YouTuber and self-proclaimed Zelda fan <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@Littlejem">Littlejem</a>, one of them <em>actually</em> exists (thanks, <a href="https://frvr.com/blog/news/talented-legend-of-zelda-fan-builds-functional-wind-waker-boat/">FRVR</a>).</p>
<p>Yes, as detailed in her latest video, Littlejem has successfully created a full functional replica of The King of Red Lions. For goodness' sake, the head and mouth even move! It's pretty spectacular. Granted, it's 'sailing' via a motor and not by, y'know, the wind, but the fact that it's even staying afloat is quite remarkable.</p>
<p>The video takes you through the whole creation process, including the initial conception, the building and painting process, and the first on-water test. If you want to check out the finished piece, however, then you can simply skip ahead to the final segment at the 28-minute mark.</p>
<p>Congrats to Littlejem for this incredible creation; it's a great tribute to the game, and we're all for it.</p>

            <p>
I'd entirely forgotten about <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/battlestar-galactica">Battlestar Galactica</a>. I wouldn't say hearing the show's melancholy singsong theme during Gamescom's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gamescom-announcements-opening-night-live-2025">Opening Night Live</a> gave me Proustian nostalgia pangs, but it did fill me with a vague desire to look up <a href="https://www.moddb.com/mods/battlestargalactica-fleetcommander">Gunstar mods for Homeworld</a>.</p>
<p>The game announcement in question was for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/battlestar-galactica-scattered-hopes">Battlestar Galactica: Scattered Hopes</a>, a new tactical roguelite from the developers of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/crying-suns">Crying Suns</a>. Published by Dotemu, it gives you quasi-isometric control of the human armada racing to escape the sinister Cylon fleet. You'll divide your time between managing tensions aboard your ships via branching story beats, assigning limited upgrade resources, flushing out new vessels from the planets you visit, and fending off the perfidious toasters in real-time space combat. Here's a trailer.

It seems pretty standard-issue for a roguelike, and appropriately oppressive. Each run sees you navigating between planets and points of interest that harbour threats and opportunities. Every action you take within systems hastens the arrival of the Cylons. When they show up, you must keep them occupied for long enough to complete calculations for an FTL jump to the next sector. There's a tactical pause to help you plot out manoeuvres. Other enemies may come from within: there are Cylons who can pose as humans, remember. It sort of makes me want to play a Battlestar-flavoured <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/among-us">Among Us</a>. Doubtless there's a mod for that.
</p><p>
I think Crying Suns has a superior sense of atmosphere. I still find that game's vast bridge viewing port quite magnetic, whereas Scattered Hopes feels more formulaic and Paradoxy in its visual direction. Still, I am always up for some fugitive fleet-building, particularly given <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/jumplight-odyssey-development-suspended-indefinitely-as-league-of-geeks-face-redundancies">the sad demise of Jumplight Odyssey</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/homeworld-3s-last-major-update-adds-superweapons-campaign-interludes-and-a-new-armour-system">the wobbly fortunes of the Homeworld series of late</a>. Battlestar's relatively unglamorous, 'low-tech' ships are fun to think about, versus the borderline magical functionality of the fancier Star Treks.</p>
<p>Scattered Hopes is out Q1 2026 - late winter/early spring. Read more on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2535950/Battlestar_Galactica_Scattered_Hopes/">Steam</a>. If you think roguelikes are a terrible Cylon perversion, there's also Slitherine's much more Homeworldly <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/battlestar-galactica-deadlock">Battlestar Galactica Deadlock</a> from 2017. Moving away from the strategy genre, I'm chuffed to learn of an ancient <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/battlespace-freestar-galactica-diaspora">Battlestar mod for Freespace 2</a>.

<p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7’s Camo grind is set to be the biggest in the franchise’s history, with more Mastery Camos than ever before to secure.</p>



<p>Gathering the exclusive Camos across all modes has become a popular pastime for players, with exclusive Camos available in Multiplayer, Zombies, and Warzone.</p>



<p>In Black Ops 7, releasing <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-releases-november-14/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">November 14</a>, Campaign joins the mix with its own set of Mastery Camos, giving players another avenue to run down in the hunt to secure them all.</p>



<h2 id="h-black-ops-7-will-feature-16-mastery-camos">Black Ops 7 Will Feature 16 Mastery Camos</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Get your grind on. Image via Activision</figcaption></figure>



<p>As revealed in the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/08/19/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-co-op-campaign-multiplayer-and-zombies-launching-november-14/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PlayStation blog</a>, Black Ops 7 will feature Global Progression in the campaign for the first time, with Player and Weapon XP, challenges, and Weapon Camos earned through the campaign transfering over to Multiplayer and Zombies, along with Warzone when Season 1 launches.</p>



<p>Black Ops 7 will feature 30 weapons at launch, each with its own set of camos available across the various modes, and four Mastery Camos will be available for Campaign, along with their usual appearances in other modes.</p>



<p>Mastery Camos in Call of Duty are the most illustrious of them all, requiring you to complete all other challenges to unlock. For the rarest, this includes completing all challenges across all weapons in the same class, so it’s the ultimate flex on other players.</p>



<p>The campaign grind will become much more manageable with the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-co-op-campaign-details-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">return of co-op</a>, which supports up to four players, and the End Game mode in Avalon will likely be the area where the majority of the Camo grind takes place.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">A game of phantom and mouse.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">As a general rule, any first-person game where you’re walking around derelict areas and pointing a camera at things is probably going to be super creepy, and upcoming asymmetrical shooter Project Spectrum certainly seems like it will reinforce this tried-and-true guideline. The brief eight-minute hands-off demo of this suspenseful shooter left me with as many questions as I got answers, with lots left unexplained about how exactly this weird idea will work, but it also showed signs of a fairly new take on the asymmetrical multiplayer genre that’s become one of my favorite pastimes in recent years. Taking a page out of fellow supernaturally inclined monster slaying game <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/hunt-showdown-1896"><u>Hunt: Showdown 1896</u></a>, you and your friends explore the map and take down dangerous creatures as you hunt the boss in each area for a final confrontation – in this case, using your camera to track the source of the reality-warping ghostly corruption that plagues the world. But instead of competing against rival crews, you’re being hunted yourself by player-controlled, bizarre looking monstrosities with frightening abilities, adding a bit of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/evolve"><u>Evolve</u></a>-like flavor to the mix.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">From the few bits of story I was able to glean, Project Spectrum has you playing as special paranormal hunters entering areas affected by a supernatural entity called Ember Zones where you’ll track down the source of the corruption and kill them dead. Mixing horror elements, like zombies rushing at you and spooky investigation sequences where you’re looking over your shoulder while snapping a photo of some strange anomaly, with more traditional FPS gameplay where you’re shooting humans in a rundown mansion and crafting improvised trip mines to keep would-be interlopers at bay, will hopefully make for a nice pairing of action-packed combat and tense creepy sections that could be a match made in heaven, even if I didn’t get the impression that story was a major focus (though it’s hard to tell from such a short demo).</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">There was also a pretty clever crafting system where you could do things like scavenge a soda pop can from the ground and convert it into a silencer for your pistol with a bit of good ol’ survival game ingenuity. I still have a lot of questions about how crafting works, since at one point they crafted a trip mine using a grenade and wire that they got seemingly out of nowhere, but it was still a nice touch.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The most interesting part of the demo, though, came when a powerful multi-armed creature suddenly popped out of nowhere and started hunting the players, and it was revealed to be controlled by another human.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The most interesting part of the demo, though, came when a powerful multi-armed creature suddenly popped out of nowhere and started hunting the players, and it was revealed to be controlled by another human. As a freaky-looking ball of smoke with dangerously flailing limbs, this player hopped on top of the mansion the human players were exploring and hunted them down one-by-one, leaping from place to place when they were separated from one another to pick them off. I wasn’t able to get a sense of what the creature’s abilities might be, or what it might feel like to play as them, but seeing it crawl on top of buildings, stalking unaware players down below definitely sounds like my idea of a good time.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">There are some pretty big things I’m still not entirely clear on, like what the meta progression looks like, for example. The developer didn’t say if Project Spectrum will have a traditional story-driven campaign, or will be limited to one-off matches on a preset map where you’re making progress in some other way. Since it’s a free-to-play game with a multiplayer focus that has a lot in common with Hunt: Showdown, my guess is it’ll be the latter, but with a lot of focus on worldbuilding, it’s a bit hard to say for sure.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And although there were some neat ideas, like the crafting system and the ability to play as a creepy monster hunting players, there’s a bit too many unanswered questions for me to get excited just yet. For example, the gunplay looked a bit basic, with generic pistols and assault rifles that seemed a tad boring in a game about hunting ghosts, and melee gameplay looked a bit sloppy as well. Also, there was one part where a character revived another player, and the animation for doing so was grabbing a whole med kit and rotating it around their own arm like they were applying gauze, which broke my brain for a minute. It seems pretty likely to me that this is a very early look at a game that is likely to change quite a bit before we’re able to understand how it’s taking shape.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Project Spectrum - First Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">I’ll need to see more (and hopefully get my hands on it) before I get my hopes up, but a new IP with some interesting new ideas and the chance to scare the pants off my friends as an interdimensional monster certainly is welcome news. Here’s hoping we get the chance to take a closer look at Project Spectrum in the coming months.</p></section><div><h3 data-cy="object-summary-embed-title">In This Article</h3></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/project-spectrum-is-looking-extremely-weird-and-more-than-a-little-creepy]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Buckle up for the unlikely sequel that has heaps of zany charm.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">After zipping around in Kirby Air Riders for maybe an hour, I rushed back to my apartment to get in a round of Mario Kart World just to <em>see. </em>In the game’s Direct earlier this week, director Masahiro Sakurai said (even if he was just being cheeky) his unlikely GameCube sequel was <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sakurai-says-kirby-air-riders-is-basically-mario-kart-in-extremely-smash-bros-style-direct"><u>“basically Mario Kart</u></a>.” And yeah, if you compare the two on the level of “a bunch of guys from decades of Nintendo games race around and/or duke it out” then sure, I guess. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">In every other way, Kirby Air Riders is so extremely not just a Mario Kart redux that riding around 150cc matches at home felt practically quaint. Wall rides and bar grinds? That’s cute. In Kirby Air Riders, I’m drifting corners so screamin’ fast that I barely had time to blink. Whirlpool traps and gentle river runs? How serene. Air Riders’ Waveflow Waters race course has <em>violent</em> vortexes and corridors of walls made of water to punch through. Oh, and brace yourself for a gigantic meteor shower of fireballs that reign down during City Trials too! </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In the time I spent with Air Riders, I got through a good chunk of tutorials, raced through two Air Rider courses (Floria Fields and Waveflow Waters, both of which were featured in the Direct), and crushed three rounds of City Trials, the topographical brawler and power-up collection zone that ends in a challenge of your choosing. Getting through the checklist of lessons to get a handle on maneuvering, as patronizing as they may seem for a game that now relies on two whole buttons (up from one!), was actually quite nice. Because once an Air Ride or City Trial started, it was buckle-up time and not as easy as it might seem on paper. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>As for the expanded cast of characters, I only got to mess around with a few, but Bandana Waddle Dee with his spear flurry is my early frontrunner for favorite. </p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Part of that boils down to each of the many machines having distinct characteristics that aren’t just a matter of alleged differences in weight and handling that a chart claims when I’m picking it. The way, say, a tank drives, which is heavy and super directionally flexible, is wildly different from Meta Knight’s soaring shadow glider, and I think a lot of the fun will be in the trial-and-error of those. As for the expanded cast of characters, I only got to mess around with a few, but Bandana Waddle Dee with his spear flurry is my early frontrunner for favorite. (I wanted to love Starman, but I need some more time for him to grow on me.)</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Like my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xFE6aoTQYA" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>NVC host colleagues have already called out</u></a> about Kirby Air Ride (2003), City Trials is still the standout game. It’s also the most derived from Sakurai’s Super Smash Bros. directorial sensibilities, from its brawler nature down to the selection screen and slow-mo KO animations. It is, however, utter pandemonium, like the aforementioned meteors that you’ll need to avoid or sudden calls to zoom over to a highlighted area to fight in a dust-up, if you so choose. The five-minute countdown breezed by as I attempted to manhandle my gliders to collect power-ups, food items that were practically copy-pasted from the real world into the dreamy palette of Kirby Air Riders, and also wreck some other players. Was I excelling at any of this? Not really, but the game didn’t make winning feel like it was the priority (which I guess is quite different from Smash Bros., where loser characters look onto the winner with existential anguish). It was more important to simply have fun, and it’s easy to imagine anyone from grade schoolers to college kids and cool adults (ahem) turn Kirby Air Riders into a shouty party game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The maximalism of Kirby Air Riders is its core charm; it feels brewed from impish, chaotic-neutral alchemy. Even Nintendo is calling this a “vehicle action game,” not a kart racer, which honestly seems apt – a silly genre distinction for a purposefully unserious game. It might not have been the sequel the people were clamoring for, but I’m glad that it exists. </p></section><div><h3 data-cy="object-summary-embed-title">In This Article</h3></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/kirby-air-riders-the-first-preview]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-weapon-build-feature-makes-sharing-loadouts-easier/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 will feature a new feature to weapon builds that makes it easier than ever to share loadouts with friends and other players.</p>



<p>Black Ops 7, releasing <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-releases-november-14/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">November 14</a>, continues the trend of having highly customizable weapons, with adjustments impacting everything from fire rate to range.</p>



<p>Finding the perfect build has always been tricky, requiring players to copy a loadout piece by piece in the past, but that is changing with Black Ops 7.</p>



<h2 id="h-black-ops-7-loadout-sharing-codes">Black Ops 7 Loadout Sharing Codes</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Lock and load. Image via Activision</figcaption></figure>



<p>In Black Ops 7, created loadouts will now feature a code that can be shared with other players, which they can then input in their game to copy the design instantly—meaning no more awkwardly fiddling through the options to find the right attachment.</p>



<p>The feature was revealed in the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/08/19/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-co-op-campaign-multiplayer-and-zombies-launching-november-14/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PlayStation blog</a>, announcing that players can share or import Weapon Build Codes to try out loadouts with ease—and while the post says to try friends’ designs, it’s more than likely going to be used to copy creator designs or loadouts that appear on websites like ours or TikTok.</p>



<p>However, it’s unknown what will happen if you input a code that includes attachments you haven’t unlocked yet and whether the loadout will be blocked, or if it can be saved for later.</p>



<p>Black Ops 7 has also confirmed the return of Weapon Prestige, said to be the “deepest and most rewarding” system yet, awarding Prestige Attachments and Weapon Camos.</p>



<p>More details will be shared in the coming months, with a full multiplayer reveal scheduled for <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/cod-next-announced-september-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">September 30’s COD Next showcase</a>, while a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-7-zombies-reveal-september/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">deep dive into Zombies is due in early September</a>.</p>



<p>How much easier is this feature going to make building weapon loadouts in Black Ops 7? Let us know your thoughts in the<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/threads/3348/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>

<p>Kirby has the ability to put everyone in a good mood, right? I mean, I've been in a lovely mood thanks to the pink puffball (and Nintendo), as I was lucky enough to go hands-on with the upcoming racer <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/kirby-air-riders">Kirby Air Riders</a> for the Nintendo Switch 2 at Gamescom in Cologne, Germany.</p>
<p>As a surprising sequel to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/kirby_air_ride">Kirby Air Ride</a> on the GameCube, it's a really fascinating game, and it does, as director Masahiro Sakurai said in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/kirby-air-riders-direct-every-announcement-how-would-you-rate-it">yesterday's Nintendo Direct</a>, feel very different to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a>. So let me run you through what I got to play during my behind-closed-doors session.</p>
<p>I, along with around 20 or so other people, were all shuffled into a room together where, to my surprise, we got to watch the Direct together. Here is where I started really falling for this game. This was the first time we'd seen any gameplay, and it looked great. But the way Sakurai presents and goes into so much detail is what really did it for me.</p>
<figure><a title="Kirby Air Riders" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/506543d4217a3/kirby-air-riders.large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Not a picture of me winning... but I did win! — <em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Right after the Direct, I got to go hands-on with the game, where I started off with some Lessons covering how to boost dash, drift, fly, land, capture enemies, etc. I only got to try a handful of these (through numbers three to nine) but these were really nice and helped me get to grips with the controls and movement.</p>
<p>If you've played Kirby Air Ride before, then you'll be familiar with the controls, but I haven't. The GameCube game only came out a year after I was born <em>(Ouch, I feel my back creaking... Ed~)</em>; of course, I could have gone back and played it (though it's <a href="https://www.ebay.com/b/Kirby-Air-Ride-Video-Games/139973/bn_7368608?mkcid=1&amp;mkrid=710-53481-19255-0&amp;campid=5336736927&amp;toolid=10001&amp;mkevt=1" rel="sponsored noopener">not exactly the cheapest game</a>), but I was never really intrigued to check it out. However, now the new one is on the way? My goodness.</p>

<p>Anyway, I had to learn how to turn, which sounds a bit silly, but in Kirby Air Riders and its predecessor, you don't need to accelerate with the 'A' button, you just... <em>go</em>. So that took some getting used to. In the original game, you only used one button for everything, including to stop so you could turn your vehicle (called machines) around and then boost ahead. But in Air Riders, the devs have added a second button — yes, very exciting — which allows your racer to use their Special move.</p>
<p>Learning all of this didn't take very long, and I also found out by tilting the left stick side-to-side, you can do a spin attack and ram into other opponents. You can even inhale other characters and copy them. There's <em>a lot</em> of stuff going on.</p>
<p>After Lessons, we were all thrown into two regular races in Air Ride mode. I got to race on Floral Fields and Wave Flow Waters and I was really impressed by both courses. I tried out some different combos of characters and machines, too. For one of the pairings, my turns were really slow but had good speed otherwise, plus my character had an excellent special which helped me win the second race, even though we were playing with bots.</p>

<p>That all changed when we dived into City Trial, the big, meaty event for Kirby Air Riders. Here, we got to play three times and we were against three other people. This was a hugely popular mode in the original game, but here, it's been fleshed out and improved massively. In Air Riders, for example, you can simply switch karts seamlessly driving into them and pressing 'Y' rather than jumping off one and on another, and you get little suggestions on the screen that tell you what you might want to do next. And, at the end of a City Trial session, you all get to vote on the final minigame which you're all building up to.</p>
<p><em>'But wait, Felix, building up? Changing karts? What are you talking about?'</em> Well, in City Trial, you're driving around on this big island called Skyah, and it is <em>really</em> big, and you need to find a vehicle to upgrade to from your basic Warp Star. Then you drive around and collect all sorts of different power-ups — you can increase speed, air-time, boost your attack, defense, there are so many things to collect.</p>
<p>While I was collecting these upgrades and messing around, I discovered something that Sakurai also briefly stumbled upon during the Direct, a sort of glass-looking satellite in the sky which I thought was really cool. Not only are there secrets to find, but there are also multiple events taking place on the map too like big spiky balls falling from the sky, Kracko making an appearance, or a quick race where the winner in first-place will win lots of power-ups.</p>

<p>All of this is meant to get you to build the best possible vehicle for the final minigame in the Stadium. This can be a handful of options from Air Rider, which tests you on who can fly the farthest, or it can be a big brawl in Dustup Derby. It can even be a Gourmet Race, which tasks you with eating the most food. It's all really varied and exciting.</p>
<p>I think my biggest issue with City Trial is that you have five-minutes to go and collect all these power-ups, which to me is a little bit too long. Now it looks like there's lots of customisation in this game, so I'm hoping that means we can change or lower the time. It might be better when you're playing with 16 real people, but it felt a little anticlimactic when I played with just three others as, when we got to the final challenge, because we each voted on different minigames every time, we'd end up racing CPU-controlled rivals. We did eventually team up and vote for the same challenge for the last one, and , well, I actually won that one!</p>

<p>Another problem I had was that sometimes you can go <em>so fast</em> that it's hard to even know what's happening on the screen. Maybe it's my fault for aiming for the quickest stats, but this is where I started to experience a little bit of motion sickness. Now, you know I've also struggled with this in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a>, but with Kirby, it's not only me as one of the Nintendo representatives said that they actually got motion sickness playing the game, too.</p>
<p>It also might have to do with the fact we were sitting really close to a big TV (they were close together and we were advised to sit back if we could, which I did) so our whole depth-of-field was just Kirby Air Riders at maximum speed going left and right. So I'll have to see how I cope when the game launches.</p>
<p>There's a lot we still haven't seen, but even this early on, there's so much variety. In the character roster, for instance, not only are there many cool and weird picks like Susie (from <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/3ds/kirby_planet_robobot">Planet Robobot</a>) and Gooey (from <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gameboy/kirbys_dream_land_2">Kirby's Dream Land 2</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/kirbys_dream_land_3">3</a>) but they all have multiple costumes. Kirby comes in pink, yellow, purple, and one other colour, while King Dedede has his standard red robes alongside a blue robe and a pink one. Some only have two, while Kirby has the most at four (for now). I also really love that <em>all</em> of the characters, not just Kirby, can copy abilities, this alone makes it feel different than Mario Kart, and I can't wait to see what Meta Knight looks like holding a microphone.</p>

<p>Right now, I'm worried that City Trial will get old and I think it's a little odd that the final minigame splits your group of 16 into four different groups — there's the option to vote for a random challenge, which will then just throw you into a random minigame or group at the end, so I think the voting system is the best solution we have right now for variety. On the whole, though, I enjoyed Air Ride mode the most because I felt the adrenaline rush more.</p>
<p>Graphically and musically, however, this game is fantastically phenomenal, it's got that Sakurai magic. The colours pop, the animations are bold and expressive, and the orchestral songs and remixes are all brilliant. The sparkling, explosions, and all the other sound effects really help bring everything together.</p>
<p>So, in case you case you couldn't tell, I think that Kirby Air Riders is shaping up to be really great. I had a really nice time racing with others and the controls feel extremely natural and easy to learn. Kirby is having a heck of a year on Switch 2, I can't wait to see more of this game when it launches on 20th November 2025.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/fallout-season-two-trailer-change-retcon-new-vegas/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/fallout-fans-notice-change-in-season-two-trailer-that-retcons-a-piece-of-new-vegas.1275240/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The award-winning, live-action adaptation of Fallout has a new season debuting in December. Last night, during Gamescom’s Opening Night Live showcase, a brand-new trailer was revealed by the cast, revealing a couple of minutes of the next season. It was a wild ride that unveiled the New Vegas wasteland, uncovering key tales for the road ahead.</p>



<p>Eagle-eyed Fallout fans (including myself) noticed a very obvious change that some feel might be an error, while others believe it’s merely the team taking some creative license with the show.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-happened-to-dinky">What Happened to Dinky?</h2>



<p>In Fallout: New Vegas (2010), players will inevitably head to Novac, a settlement built around an old motel. Flanking that motel is a towering Tyrannosaurus Rex statue affectionately named ‘Dinky’. Players will eventually link up with Boone, a marksman who sits in the mouth of the dinosaur, using his head as a sniper’s nest.</p>



<p>In the Fallout season two trailer, we see Novac and Dinky more than once, but something <strong>is different</strong>.</p>



<p>As one shot reveals, Dinky has been <strong>flipped </strong>and is now facing the ‘wrong way’. In the 2010 game, Dinky is looking out over the wasteland with his back to Novac, but in the trailer for season two, he’s facing inwards and looming over the motel. This means that the sniper’s nest has a clear line of sight into the motel, rather than away from it.</p>



<p>This isn’t an enormous change, but it invalidates a portion of Fallout: New Vegas.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Fallout Season 2 - Official Teaser Trailer | gamescom 2025" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NZY5WiqeyQQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>







<p>For those not aware, the player links up with Boone in New Vegas and follows a path that sees Boone get revenge against those who sold his wife into slavery. Boone asks the player to lead the key suspect away from Novac and into the line of sight of Dinky and the sniper’s nest, with Boone exacting a portion of his revenge from afar.</p>



<p>Again, it’s not a massive change, but it’s enough that fans are questioning it.</p>

		<p>Last month, Dredge developer Black Salt Games announced its second studio called Disc 2 Games, and now the first project from this new studio has been announced. Canvas City is a turn based RPG where roller skates and graffiti tags are the implements of choice to gain victory over rivals. You can see some of the gameplay in the announcement trailer, which provides a look at tagging and battling.</p>

<p><em>“Movement isn’t just getting from one spot to another, it’s part of the plan”</em>&nbsp;explains Technical Director Kris Nicholson.&nbsp;<em>“Chaining tricks and attacks mid-turn changes how you think about positioning and opens up new ways to win.”</em></p>
<p>In Canvas City, battles take place between rival crews with each one having their own goals. Some of these crews are backed by corporations while others are freestylers trying to claim the streets back from an oppressive regime. Players can recruit up to 12 different skaters, each with their own skill sets to take on the different crews and aim to beat them to progress in the story. The gameplay of Canvas City does not just consist of attacking enemy crew members though. To power up abilities, characters need to pull off tricks and attack to build up Style Points. These style points are then used to activate more powerful abilities. As you progress through the game new upgrades will be unlocked to make your crew more powerful, allowing them to take on the tougher challenges that will come their way.</p>

<p>Canvas City is due to be released for PC and Nintendo Switch, though a release date is yet to be confirmed.</p>

      </p></div><div><p><a title="Companies > Bloober Team [106 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/bloober-team">Bloober Team</a> has released a new trailer for third-person <a title="Genres > Survival [445 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/survival">survival</a> <a title="Genres > Horror [685 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/horror">horror game</a> <em><a title="Games > Cronos: The New Dawn [8 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/cronos-the-new-dawn">Cronos: The New Dawn</a></em> dubbed “A New Breed of Horror.” <span id="more-986296"></span></p><p>Get the latest details below.</p><blockquote><p>The trailer opens from a cat’s-eye view—an eerie, ground-level perspective that turns the familiar into something surreal. As if the trailer wasn’t enough, The Traveler made a dramatic appearance on stage in full cosplay—stepping out of the void and into the spotlight, blurring the line between the game and reality.</p><p><em>Cronos: The New Dawn</em> is a third-person survival horror game developed by the renowned horror studio Bloober Team, best known for the critically acclaimed <em><a title="Games > Silent Hill 2 (2024) [11 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/silent-hill-2-2024">Silent Hill 2</a></em> remake.</p><p>The game is built around a powerful, original narrative that unfolds in New Dawn – an abstract reinterpretation of the real Nowa Huta district in Kraków, Poland. The story is told across two contrasting timelines: a post-apocalyptic future and the gritty industrial reality of the 1980s. This unique setting blends retro realism with dystopian science-fiction and a retro futuristic atmosphere, creating a deeply immersive world filled with tension, mystery, and psychological depth.</p><p>At this year’s Gamescom Opening Night Live, a stunning new cinematic trailer premiered on the main stage—featuring a surprise appearance by none other than The Traveler.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>The trailer immerses us in the haunting ruins of New Dawn, beginning with a mysterious sequence that follows the movements of a cat through the desolate landscape. From there, it transitions into cinematic shots of The Traveler – the game’s central figure—whose journey we’ll follow throughout the game. We’re shown gripping, high-stakes encounters as The Traveler faces off against The Orphans—terrifying creatures that haunt this broken world. All of this plays out against the haunting soundtrack of “Sixteen Days / Gathering Dust” by This Mortal Coil, heightening the sense of mystery and atmosphere.</p></blockquote><p><em>Cronos: The New Dawn</em> is due out for <a title="Platforms > PS5 [10,160 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps5">PlayStation 5</a>, <a title="Platforms > Xbox Series [7,725 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/xbox/xbox-series">Xbox Series</a>, <a title="Platforms > Switch 2 [334 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/nintendo/switch-2">Switch 2</a>, and <a title="Platforms > PC [23,978 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2101960/Cronos_The_New_Dawn/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam</a> and <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/p/cronos-the-new-dawn-85b409" target="_blank">Epic Games Store</a> on September 5.</p><p>Watch the trailer below.

<p>According to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/NatetheHate">YouTube and podcaster 'Nate the Hate'</a>, who has already been <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/04/rumour-gamecube-revival-planned-for-nintendo-switch-online">linked to some other rumours this generation</a>, "Starfield is planned for release on the Nintendo Switch 2 in 2026".</p>

</blockquote>
<p>Although Bethesda and its developers are now under the control of Microsoft and Xbox, games from its teams are still expected to show up on other platforms.</p>
<p>Microsoft and Xbox's leadership have also reiterated how they intend to bring more of games to more platforms going forward.

<p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7’s Zombies mode will be getting its big reveal soon enough. After showcasing the game’s co-op campaign and a hint of Multiplayer, Zombies got a small section of the trailer. Still, for those who want to know more, you won’t have to wait long to find out.</p>



<p>Releasing on November 14th, Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 is returning to the cybernetic world of Black Ops 2. While the campaign picks up David Mason’s story, fans are no doubt excited for Multiplayer and Zombies. We previously reported that Multiplayer will be at <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/cod-next-announced-september-2025/">COD Next</a>, as well as Zombies. However, it looks like it may be sooner than that, thanks to confirmation from PlayStation.</p>

<p>At around <a href="https://youtu.be/r9Z15Z-f2Ys?feature=shared&amp;t=132">the 2:12 mark</a> of the latest trailer of Black Ops 7, a peek at Zombies is shown. We get a few seconds of gameplay, as well as an interesting arcade mode called Dead Ops Arcade 4. It’s not much, though it was confirmed that, alongside Multiplayer, it will be present at COD Next. The event, which takes place on September 30th, 2025, plans to show off both modes in detail. However, it looks like we may see Zombies earlier than that, as <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/08/19/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-co-op-campaign-multiplayer-and-zombies-launching-november-14/">PlayStation Blog</a> mentions an early September reveal for the mode.</p>



<p>From the Call of Duty blog, Black Ops 7’s Zombies picks off where Black Ops 6 left off, with the crew now meeting the original Black Ops Zombies members. The mode will apparently be its biggest yet, with the launch map being quite vast. For fans of Black Ops 2, Survival Maps return, so players can enjoy multiple maps to play on and last against the hordes of zombies. </p>



<p>While there isn’t a firm date as to when Black Ops 7 Zombies will be shown, it’ll be before COD Next. Given the game launches on Game Pass, you’ll be able to dive into Zombies day one if you own the subscription.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>As part of Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2’s post-launch content, the newest story expansion, Legacy of the Forge, got a brand new trailer at Gamescom Opening Night Live. Even more so, we now have a release date for it, and it’s quite soon.</p>



<p>Made by Warhorse Studios, Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2’s immersive RPG gameplay improves over the original in many ways. Already being helmed as one of 2025’s best, the studio has been hard at work with post-launch content. It’s first, Brushes with Death, added new quests with an art-focused storyline, as well as shield customization. While one, Mysteria Ecclesiae, is still planned, the next one is Legacy of the Forge, which was shown off in a brand new trailer.</p>

<p>In the trailer, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JcvB6lH-LKI">shown above</a>, Henry acts upon his late father’s legacy and starts using his old forge to craft new weapons for the folks of Kuttenberg. Legacy of the Forge, which releases on September 9th, 2025, will let players create new weapons and armor to use. Plus, new story content following Henry uncovering his father’s past will be added. In it, you’ll meet allies that may reveal another side to Henry’s father that he never knew.</p>



<p>In addition, players can now customize their own houses. You can personalize many aspects of your domicile, like your armory and bedroom. With over 100 million variations, there are no limits to your medieval imagination. All of the new content in Legacy of the Forge will cost $13.99 on all platforms, though Expansion Pass holders will get the DLC for free. </p>



<p>The success of Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 doesn’t come as too much of a surprise, given the original’s reception. Still, the game has become a top contender for award season, especially for RPGs and Direction. Fortunately, Legacy of the Forge and subsequent DLC will ensure it isn’t going anywhere, which fans will be more than happy about. </p>

<p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 is getting a COD Next all about it in late September. After getting its gameplay reveal at Gamescom Opening Night Live, Activision has announced when we’ll see more. Fortunately, it won’t be long before we see more Multiplayer.</p>



<p>Releasing on November 14th, 2025, Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-story-trailer-gamescom/">brings the series back</a> to the Mason family, specifically David Mason. In 2035, he and his crew are taken into a warped reality thanks to Black Ops 2’s Raul Menendez. Going off of Black Ops 6 ‘s success last year, Raven and Treyarch aren’t pulling punches, as the new COD Next is weeks away.</p>



<h2 id="h-black-ops-7-s-cod-next-streams-on-september-30th-2025">Black Ops 7’s COD Next Streams on September 30th, 2025</h2>

</p></figure>



<p>It’s been announced that the next COD Next will livestream on September 30th, 2025. No exact timing or platforms are available as of writing. In it, fans will get a look at Black Ops 7’s Multiplayer, which <a href="https://youtu.be/r9Z15Z-f2Ys?feature=shared&amp;t=126">was teased</a> in the trailer above. COD Next also plans to have famous content creators try out the new Multiplayer and Zombies modes live. Then, on October 2nd, a beta will occur for fans to finally get their hands on it at home. </p>



<p>Despite releasing a bit later than most Call of Duty’s do, Black Ops 7 looks to be another fun futuristic take on the series. While the co-op campaign might turn some solo players off, there’s no doubt that it’ll sell quite well. Even more so, it will launch Day One on Xbox Game Pass, meaning more people than ever can play. All that said, COD Next is an event many should keep tabs on, especially since Multiplayer is the series’ bread and butter. </p>
