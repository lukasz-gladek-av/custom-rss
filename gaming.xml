Enemies respawn after resting at a checkpoint, its challenging battles require you to manage a stamina meter, and perilous exploration can end in certain death if you’re not careful. So it’s reasonable for you to be wondering if <em>Black Myth: Wukong</em> features another common soulslike staple: New Game Plus (NG+).<br></p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="193831" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Week In Games: Octopath Dreamland Deluxe" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="226" data-playlist="193831,195410,196299" data-current="193831"><div><p>The Week In Games: Octopath Dreamland Deluxe</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/193831/193831_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/193831/193831_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/193831/193831_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/193831/193831_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/19283.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>This mode is known for allowing players to replay a game using all of the equipment and upgrades they earned in a previous playthrough, wielding it all against tougher enemies and bosses—and in some cases, entirely new threats that weren’t present in the initial experience.<br></p><p><em>Black Myth: Wukong</em> provides players with this always much-appreciated feature.

<p>According to a new report, a Pokemon Card Shop in Hong Kong was allegedly caught with over $1 million worth of crystal meth.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As per <a href="https://www.scmp.com/news/hong-kong/law-and-crime/article/3275171/hong-kong-police-raid-pokemon-card-shop-used-drug-front-seize-hk10-million-ice" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">South China Morning Post</a> (via <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pokemon-card-shop-had-over-1-million-in-meth-police-say/1100-6526063/?fta" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Gamespot</a>), the Pokemon Card Shop was a 400-square-foot upstairs store in the Hung Hom district, and it was a popular spot for teenagers, children, and other enthusiasts. After an “extensive investigation”, the Hong Kong police searched a 28-year-old man outside the shop and found 5kg of crystal meth on him. Upon searching the premises, they found an additional 16kgs of meth in the “staff resting area”. The total 21kgs of drugs was worth over HK$10 million or US$1.3 million.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Inspector Liong Chun-hin ensured through a statement that no children or teenagers were distributed drugs, and neither of them was involved in the trafficking at the Pokemon Card Shop. However, he added that “storing such a large quantity of the narcotics in a place where teenagers and children can visit is irresponsible and disgraceful behaviour that also heightens the possible risk of teenagers and children mistakenly encountering illegal drugs”.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Liong believes that the 28-year-old man working at the Pokemon Card Shop was “recruited by a drug-trafficking syndicate with promises of money and used his store to store the narcotics in an attempt to avoid detection”.&nbsp;The accused has been charged with drug trafficking and will appear at the Kowloon City Court on Wednesday.</p>

<p>According to a recent Hasbro job listing, the upcoming G.I. Joe Snake Eyes game will seemingly be open-world.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The <a href="https://jobs.hasbro.com/job/Raleigh-Durham-Sr-WorldLevel-Designer-Nort/1202485900/?feedId=406100" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">job listing</a> is for a senior world/Level designer for a brand-new development studio called Atomic Arcade. The studio is in the process of finding staff to work on their first multi-platform AAA game. The upcoming title will be “a bold and contemporary new take on the G.I. Joe Universe,” and it will star the iconic character Snake Eyes.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The new listing revealed that the upcoming G.I. Joe Snake Eyes title will be a AAA third-person action adventure. The listing also asked for ‘experience working on open-world and/or Sandbox projects’ in the Extra Credit section, suggesting this could be an open-world G.I. Joe game.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The last update we received about the upcoming G.I. Joe Snake Eyes game was through a <a href="https://atomicarcade.com/news/development-update-1-gi-joe-snake-eyes-game" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">blog post</a> in 2023. Atomic Arcade revealed then that the game had officially transitioned from the concept stage to the pre-production phase.&nbsp;Atomic Arcade is part of Hasbro’s Wizards of the Coast division, known for creating top-rated games like Magic: The Gathering and Dungeons and Dragons.&nbsp;</p>

However, GameSpot was invited to a hands on preview during <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/gamescom-opening-night-live-2024-all-the-biggest-announcements/2900-5715/" data-ref-id="2900-5715">Gamescom</a>, and senior producer Jean-Luc Seipke is sharing their Monster Hunter Wilds experience in our video overview. And there's a lot for fans to look forward to.</p><p>The first thing that fans may notice is that Monster Hunter Wilds has a much bigger map to explore than previous titles. The Monster Hunter camp site is also directly connected to the map this time, and a further sense of community can be found while going on four player co-op hunts. Players are also allowed to pick secondary weapons, which dramatically changes combat in the game.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> We Played Monster Hunter Wilds And It Rules Hands On Preview</p>
      </div>
<p>Monster Hunter Wilds is also adding a new focus mode to combat that allows players more precise control of their weapons. This mode also makes the weak points on a monster's body glowing in red, which cues the player to attack those body parts to bring down the creature more quickly. That also makes it easier for teammates to coordinate their attacks.</p><p>During the demo, there were periodic lightning storms that heralded the arrival of lightning dragons, which Seipke was not able to defeat. The storms also drastically changed the visibility of the environment. Additionally, the demo did away with Monster Hunters' quest board and let players pick their hunts more naturally.</p><p>There were some bugs in the demo, including a lagging frame rate and an occasional crash. But these aren't uncommon for games that haven't been finished. We expect those flaws to be corrected by the time the game hits stores, and the rest of the experience more than made up for the few hiccups that occurred.</p><p>Monster Hunter Wilds will be released on Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 5, and PC in 2025.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/i-have-some-thoughts-and-concerns-about-civilization-vii<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Of all the big reveals made this week<a href="https://aftermath.site/peter-molyneux-masters-of-albion-gamescom" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> as part of GeoffsCom</a>, none spoke to my soul more than the first proper look at <em>Civilization VII</em>, the latest instalment in a series dating back to <em>1990</em>. And after looking, then looking some more, then reading some previews from people who looked even closer, I have some thoughts!</p><p>I wrote about <em>Civilization VI</em> quite a number of times at the Old Site,<a href="https://kotaku.com/civilization-vi-the-kotaku-review-1788213327" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> firstly in somewhat glowing terms</a>, then<a href="https://kotaku.com/civilization-civ-vi-6-review-2023-retrospective-pc-sid-1850242218#:~:text=I%20love%20the%20way%20Civilization,the%20field%20is%20a%20blast." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> in less glowing terms</a> as the years marched on. In short: I don't think <em>Civ VI</em> aged very well! It made divergences from the series' fundamentals that led players away from <em>Civ's </em>strengths and towards an abstract numbers game, which is a very serious and boring critic's way of saying I fucking <em>hated</em> the district system, which over time became<em> Civ VI's</em> "meta" in a way that wasn't very <em>Civ</em>. The game's AI also sucked, though it was also pretty dire in <em>Civ V</em>, so who knows, that may just be an issue with the series' move from squares to hexes on the game map.</p><p><a href="https://kotaku.com/sid-meier-civilization-vi-vii-2k-firaxis-4x-announce-1850138311" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Civ VI </em>has also been out <em>forever</em></a>. Eight years at time of posting this, and by the time <em>Civ VII</em> is released in February 2025, it'll be <em>nine</em>. That's an eternity in video game years. During that span, a whole catalogue of credible 4X competitors have for the first time reared their heads, from Amplitude's <em>Endless </em>games and <em>Humankind </em>to the excellent <em>Old World</em> to, less successfully, Paradox's <em>Millennia</em>. For the first time in series history <em>Civ </em>hasn't just had to iterate on itself, it's had the opportunity to learn from and be influenced by others as well.</p><p>And it appears to have done so. <em>Civ VII's</em> big change seems to be the introduction of Ages, which break each game up into three distinct eras, allowing the player to change the civilization (but not the <em>leader</em>) they're playing as they move through each one.<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/civilization-7-the-first-preview" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> An example given in this IGN preview</a>, for example, describes a progression from Roman to Norman to English. It'll be interesting to see how <em>Civilization</em> handles this, because it <em>sucked </em>in <em>Humankind</em>, robbing every faction in that game of any sense of identity or continuity.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Sid Meier’s Civilization VII - Official Gameplay Showcase" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Tc3_EO6Bj2M?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>I'm also a bit unsure about the new city system. Specific districts are gone–thank God, you will not be missed–but they've been replaced with something <em>similar</em>, albeit modular, where you just place urban or rural hexes on the map then specialise those tiles from there. How this works exactly I don't think we'll know until we play it, but there's one consequence of it I already don't like: it removes builders from the game. They're gone! No more little guys to move around building roads and districts,<a href="https://aftermath.site/strategy-game-turn-based-tactics-movement" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> and if there's one thing I've made very clear is a long-standing <em>Civilization </em>bright spot, it's moving little guys around</a>. RIP, little guys. You will be missed.</p><p>One final gripe: I don't like these new leaders.<a href="https://www.kotaku.com.au/2017/01/civilization-6-has-the-most-incredible-animation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> <em>Civ VI's</em> rulers were an animation masterclass</a>, and its successors here just don't appear to have the same character. I get that each game strikes a slightly different tone, and that in the months to go until release they might change, but as they appear in these trailers, I don't like 'em.</p><p>Anyway, I don't want to let this get too bogged down with negativity, so let's move onto stuff I <em>do </em>like. I love the map. I <em>looooovveee </em>the map. <em>Civ </em>has always had a board game feel--<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civilization_(1980_board_game)#Legacy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">it's based on a board game, after all!</a>--but <em>Civ VII</em> takes this to another level, with its unexplored hexes looking like premium <em>Catan </em>tiles, and the world itself going for a decidedly model train scenery vibe (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qw6H7r8S_Wk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">something the game's own marketing picks up on</a>). And I mean that in the very best way, the world looks <em>crafted</em>.</p><p>Diplomacy has also had a big overhaul. The old system, largely unchanged since the very first <em>Civ</em>, had well and truly run its course; it was overly simple, and competitors within and outside this genre have long been doing it better. Influence in <em>Civ VII</em> is now a resource you generate and can spend rather than just trading stuff from a menu, which will hopefully make for more dynamic--and less intrusive and repetitive--interactions.</p><figure><figcaption>The map looks GREAT</figcaption></figure><p>Speaking of things being less repetitive, I like the little quality of life tweaks found within the game's trailers and previews. Scouts being able to traverse rivers on a boat and not on foot, for example, doesn't just let you explore faster, but is much more realistic! Also promising is a town -&gt; city system, similar to what <em>Humankind </em>offers, where not every settlement has to be developed into a sprawling metropolis you need to constantly manage and build stuff from. In <em>Civ VII</em> only cities let you run proper production lines; if you leave a settlement as a town it'll just generate gold and let you go about your day, which will make admin much easier for those who prefer sprawling empire.</p><p>One final thing that sounds neat is the way expansion is handled. Most <em>Civ </em>playthroughs (or playthroughs of competitors, for that matter) are always conducted with one eye--even in the game's earliest phases--on exploring distant lands, because we know from the hindsight afforded by the 21st century that's how history went down and was how people got access to more space and more resources. But it's not how anyone in ancient (or even medieval) times lived! <em>Civ VII </em>sidesteps this by devoting a whole Age to exploration, which causes the map to expand and introduces more territory and states to interact with. This is something that's bugged me about 4X games forever, so it's cool to at least see it addressed here, regardless of whether it actually works or not.</p><p>That's about all I've got to say. I'm normally very much against video game previews, they tend to be overly-positive and ultimately pointless for the reader, so I hope my review of other people's previews, as filtered by my own pessimism and thoughts on the series' recent past, has been at least a <em>little </em>bit useful. While I have concerns, I'm also cautiously optimistic! <em>Civilization VI </em>clearly ran the series down a dead end where big changes were necessary, and it sure looks like Firaxis are swinging for the fences here.&nbsp;</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/civilization-7-interview-ed-beach-ages<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>We finally got our first glimpse of Civilization VII's gameplay during gamescom 2024, and it's already looking much different than anything we've ever seen from the legendary series. That includes a huge shakeup to the way that Civilization VII progresses thanks to its new "ages" system, which is designed to break its progression into something like chapters.</p><p>We already <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/civilization-7-the-first-preview">checked out Civilization VII in first preview</a>, which left us with a pretty positive outlook on the anticipated sequel. Still, we had plenty of questions for creative director Ed Beach, who sat down with us for an interview at gamescom. Read on for his thoughts on Civilization VII's new structure, whether it will incorporate elements from the previous game's <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/02/11/civilization-vi-gathering-storm-review">Gathering Storm expansion</a>, and much more. And for <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gamescom-2024-announcements">everything else announced during gamescom 2024</a>, go here.</p><p>Civilization VII will release on PC, PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, and Switch on February 11, 2025.</p><p><strong>I was telling you off-screen that I just got into Civ VI and now I have to relearn Civ VII, but I think that's fine.</strong></p><p><strong>Ed Beach, Creative Director, Firaxis:</strong> We're trying to make it so the barrier of entry is a little bit lower than before. Civ VI could get a little dense in places. If you jumped in at the end with all the expansions and all the content there, that's actually not the easiest place to start. So I think Civ VII might be just the move you want to make.</p><p><strong>Yeah, I'm really excited. So you're leading me into my next question. So you've been consistently updating Civ VI and there's a lot of mod support. So why is now the best time for Civ VII?</strong></p><p><strong>Beach:</strong> Well, we've been thinking about Civ VII for quite a while. We started working on the game before the pandemic, so it is been in development quite a while. The design team had ideas that worked really well in Civ VI, but had some side effects in terms of the game takes a really long time to play. By the time you get late in the game, there's an awful lot of cities and units and so forth to manage, and we wanted to think about that and come up with a different approach so that we could make the game more manageable, more approachable, and actually just get players all the way to the finish line more often than had been happening in previous Civ games.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p><strong>Yeah, I can't tell you the amount of times I've stayed up till 3am playing just one more round. It's got me. So Gathering Storm and its global warming and mechanics offer such a dynamic change for the core gameplay. Is that something that's going to be implemented in Civ VII?</strong></p><p><strong>Beach: </strong>So we're not talking a lot yet about what comes after the exploration age after the Renaissance. The first age we're diving all the way into right now and we have demos and so forth of that. We're not going to forget about climate change, though it was very personally impactful when we got to work on that with Gathering Storm. I was the lead designer of that expansion.</p><p>I looked up a lot of things about climate change... I mean, we're not a simulator type of game, but tried to get some of the things right in terms of how sea level rise works and storms move across the globe and so forth. So we brought a lot of that forward with us and what you can see in the game right now that we're demoing with the Antiquity Age is there still are floods, there's still volcanic eruptions. We still have the storms that sweep across the map.</p><p>So a lot of that Gathering Storm mechanics, ideas, whatever, that we still have those.</p><p><strong>So is that part of the crises that is being implemented into this new system?</strong></p><p><strong>Beach: </strong>So those are sort of adjacent but similar. We have several different crises. The one that we're demoing right now is an invasion crisis, sort of imagine you're the Roman Empire and you've gotten too big and everyone wants a little piece of your action. And so those barbarians are at your gate and knocking on down the door. So that's the one that we're demoing in the build we have here right now. But we're working on other types of crises, things like unrest in your population or plagues and some of those systems for crises use the same random event system that we use for the natural disasters.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p><strong>So why did you switch to the age system?</strong></p><p><strong>Beach: </strong>So it is part of the trying to get people to have a game that is more manageable. 4X games have the problem in general, that you start with just your first unit, you get one city down, you think, wow, this game's great. It's very manageable when I get tens and dozens of cities and so many units to manage. Everything bogs down. And we wanted to break our game up into chapters very much like maybe a long book series or TV series that you might be enjoying breaks itself up into seasons or books. </p><p>So we could have big traumatic moments like these crises that you're talking about, but then also give players a chance to breathe a little bit and reset things and simplify things. And that allows you to pace the player through a long experience in a more satisfying way than just saying, "Oh no, it's just going to get bigger and bigger and bigger and you just got to keep up." </p><p>So it's a nice new way to tackle that problem and we're really excited about how it's playing out.</p><p><strong>As a new sort of player I'm very happy to hear that. But for returning players, do you think it's still challenging enough that they'll find this new system interesting?</strong></p><p><strong>Beach: </strong>Well, yeah. The experience is still just as long overall. So we actually do sort of a deeper, more immersive dive into the history of each historical age than before. And some of the gameplay mechanics, we can make deeper changes to them so that they unfold differently maybe in our antiquity age than in our exploration age, like our trade systems are different in all three ages.</p><p>So I think there's plenty for people to dive deep in. We've recently demoed the game to a whole bunch of our community veterans. They're really excited about the possibilities and theory crafting and everything. So there's going to be plenty for everyone.</p><p><strong>What was the best piece of feedback you got back from the community?</strong></p><p><strong>Beach:</strong> I think one thing we had to be really careful about is now that we've broken the game up into ages, we make you really think about who you are, which leader in civilizations are representing you in the game, and you get a chance to a unique historical pathway.</p><p>Maybe you start as Rome, and where did Rome evolve? Maybe it evolved into another European Civ and that would get you to a Germany or a Britain or France by the end of your game. And players like that historical storytelling and immersion. And we did allow some wackier combinations, and some of our fans love that because they love the theory crafting, I want to mix this with that and I'm going to be super overpowered in science.</p><p>But we also had to think about what those players who wanted the more historical pathway through our game. And so we've got the game set up so that that's the default way that both the human and the AI proceed through the game and then you have to, it's up to the player to opt into that wackier play style.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Civilization 7 - First Screenshots</h3></div></output><p><strong>Okay. So you're speaking about being able to change the leaders with each age.</strong></p><p><strong>Beach: </strong>Yes.</p><p><strong>What is the wackiest combination that you've seen so far?</strong></p><p><strong>Beach: </strong>Well, we're not talking about all the leaders and Civ's that we have now, but you can do things like, you can have Augustus Caesar lead India, you can have Hatshepsut of Egypt lead Rome. So some of the things do strike you as a little bit wacky, but there are really good reasons and compelling reasons to try those things out... leaders that don't normally go together might have bonuses in the same part of the game and you just want to explore, wow, what if I get really powerful in culture or in my military strategies?</p><p>And so those combinations are really compelling. Our quality assurance department who's playing the game all the time is like, "Oh, you got to try this one with that one, because that's amazing." So it's great to hear that kind of stuff.</p><p><strong>Okay, great. I'm definitely more military forward... So I think I will try one of those combinations that sounds very compelling to me... Well, thank you so much for speaking with me about this. I'm very excited to start a lot of wars in Civ VII that I can't finish.</strong></p><p><strong>Ed Beach: </strong>All right, well hopefully it just draws you in and you just stick with it because you want to see how it all ends and get all the way through.</p><p><em>Kat Bailey is IGN's News Director as well as co-host of Nintendo Voice Chat.

                <p>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle doesn't arrive until December 9, but you can go on interactive adventures alongside Indy (and friends) with a few budget-friendly <strong>Indiana Jones board games</strong>. Several board games based on iconic films are currently on sale, each of which should make for a fun game night with fellow fans.</p><p>Amazon has limited quantities of <strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Funko-Board-Game-Unruly-Fog/dp/B0BCXCVFQ1?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Indiana Jones: Sands of Adventure</a></strong>, a cooperative adventure from Funko Games that released last fall. The co-op game sees you and up to three other players attempting to retrieve the Ark of the Covenant before the enemy snatches it up. However, if the timer hits zero, you and your crew will be sent on a race to escape while still battling against Colonel Dietrich, Major Toht, and Dr. René Belloq. Play sessions typically run for around 45 minutes. </p><p>Over 50% of Amazon's stock has been claimed, but you can still grab a copy for $21.50 (was $30) while supplies last.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4355391-71-dqrbsw0l._ac_sl1300.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4355391" data-ratio="0.56356356356356" data-width="999" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4355391-71-dqrbsw0l._ac_sl1300.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4355391"></a><figcaption>Indiana Jones: Sands of Adventure</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4355391-71-dqrbsw0l._ac_sl1300.jpg"></figure><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4355392-91fljjp9bdl._ac_sl1500.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4355393-81emm4yhwl._ac_sl1500.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4355394-81kgh7sl4wl._ac_sl1500.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4355392,1300-4355393,1300-4355394" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1702/17023653/4355392-91fljjp9bdl._ac_sl1500.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1702/17023653/4355393-81emm4yhwl._ac_sl1500.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1702/17023653/4355394-81kgh7sl4wl._ac_sl1500.jpg"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4355392-91fljjp9bdl._ac_sl1500.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4355393-81emm4yhwl._ac_sl1500.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4355394-81kgh7sl4wl._ac_sl1500.jpg"></figure><p>You'll also find <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Funko-Board-Game-Unruly-Fog/dp/B0BCXKKPHL?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Throw Me The Idol</a> for $23 and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Funko-Board-Game-Unruly-Fog/dp/B0BCXKG2LS?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Cryptic: A Puzzles and Pathways Adventure</a> for $28 (was $35).

Starship Troopers: Extermination developer Offworld Industries has shared more on the new features coming to its bug-stomping 16-player co-operative FPS when it leaves early access and launches for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC on 11th October this year.
</p>
<p>
Extermination, which <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/starship-troopers-extermination-gets-early-access-release-date">entered early access last May</a>, casts players as members of the Deep Space Vanguard, an elite Special Forces branch of the Mobile Infantry whose job it is to wrest back control of planets from their bug invaders. That involves a lot of first-person bug-blasting, as well as a smattering of strategic base building and resource gathering, with Extermination's calling card being its ability to show hundreds of bugs on screen at once, as well as its piles of persistent corpses that can both help and hinder players.
</p>
<p>
Come its full launch in October, Extermination's current early access core will expand with a range of new modes and features - starting with the new single-player focused Special Operations Group campaign, fronted by Casper Van Dien, reprising the role of Johnny Rico.

<p>
At launch, Extermination will feature around 25 objective-based Special Operations Group missions, lasting between 2-3 hours in total, all designed to prepare newcomers for the game's 16-player mode within the framework of a (canonical!) narrative. It'll star three companion characters with their own backstories - cocky demolisher Moose, know-it-all ranger Scorch, and medic Jensen - and Offworld says further SOG chapters are currently in development.
</p>
<p>
On the multiplayer side of things, Extermination's 1.0 release also introduces the new Galactic Front campaign, letting clan-like companies of up to 30 people work toward a shared goal, collecting intel during time-limited challenges to earn cosmetic rewards.
</p>
<p>
Each Galactic Front operation will have a story, giving context to its challenges, and Offworld's goal is to dramatically change how planets look and feels as the narrative progresses, introducing different activities and mutations to match the crescendo of battle. And as part of Extermination's first Galactic Front operation, players will explore the frosty new planet of Boreas, encountering mutated warriors and drones, and perhaps even the new Tanker Bug.
</p>
<p>
All this is only the start of Offworld's ambitions for Starship Troopers: Extermination. It says it has a "robust" post-launch update plan, introducing new modes, further gameplay refinements, and it also hopes to add every bug and weapon from the live-action and animated movies in "next few years".
</p>
<p>
And if that's in any way convinced you to join the bug hunt, Starship Troopers: Extermination gets its 1.0 release for PC (via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1268750/Starship_Troopers_Extermination/">Steam</a> and <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/starship-troopers-extermination-57f59d">Epic</a>), PS5, and Xbox Series X/S on 11th October.

Here's what we saw.</p><p dir="ltr">In true Indiana Jones fashion, the game has players overcoming combat setpieces, puzzle solving, and exploration across the globe. The studio told GameSpot it sought to create an immersive Indy experience, meaning the player has to be skilled at not just piecing clues together, but also kicking Nazis butt. The studio also wanted to make something more lighthearted than what they're known for, and the Great Circle gave them the opportunity to do that.</p>

<p dir="ltr">From the Gamescom show floor, check out GameSpot's Kurt Indovina and Dave Jewitt discuss their hands-off impressions of Xbox's upcoming action-adventure game.</p><p dir="ltr">While in combat, players will have to use their environment to gain the upper hand by picking up tools they find or having bad guys run head-first into a metal pole. Unlike most MachineGames projects, the Great Circle doesn't encourage you to use your gun. Instead, it's often reserved as a last-resort item when things go especially bad.</p><p dir="ltr">A nice feature that may excite fans is that when Indy gets knocked down, he stumbles and looks for this hat. Once he finds it, it triggers a cutscene and gives players a second wind. When players aren't fighting, they can disguise themselves and sneak into enemy bases.</p><p dir="ltr">During Gamescom Opening Night Live, MachineGames also revealed that<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-release-date-set-ps5-version-confirmed/1100-6525933/"> Indiana Jones And The Great Circle will be released later this year on December 9 and will be coming to PlayStation 5 next spring.</a></p>

			<p>Earlier this week at Gamescom 2024, NVIDIA <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-dlss-3-will-be-in-dragon-age-the-veilguard-avowed-and-final-fantasy-xvi-on-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> that Dragon Age: The Veilguard would support ray tracing effects on PC alongside DLSS 3 (Super Resolution and Frame Generation).</p>
<p>Yesterday, the studio <a href="https://wccftech.com/bioware-releases-details-on-optimizing-dragon-age-the-veilguard-on-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dived</a> more deeply into the realm of PC features and optimization, confirming other upscalers (AMD FSR 2.2, Intel XeSS), support for Ultrawide displays, uncapped frame rate, and a Field of View slider despite the third-person view. They also briefly touched upon ray tracing, mentioning options like ray traced reflections, ray traced ambient occlusion, and Ultra ray tracing.</p>
<p>Today, I had the opportunity to check out Dragon Age: The Veilguard at Gamescom. While the game itself is not available for preview in Cologne, the developers brought it to the NVIDIA booth in the business area to show off the ray tracing effects. In a hands-off demonstration, I watched a 10-minute section from the beginning of the game being played live on a laptop.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/da-veilguard-pc-features-blog-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>My first question was about the Ultra RT setting. I hoped it might add extra ray traced effects, such as global illumination, but that's not the case; instead, enabling Ultra RT simply maxes out the fidelity of the ray traced reflections and ambient occlusion.</p>
<p>With that out of the way, I quickly realized that even just these two effects made quite the difference, especially in certain scenes such as the one in the screenshot above, greatly improving the game's visuals.</p>
<p>Dragon Age: The Veilguard also ran smoothly and seemingly without a hitch, even with ray tracing enabled, although the laptop was a very powerful one powered by RTX 4090 mobile GPU (which is roughly equivalent to an RTX 4080 desktop GPU). Still, that's not very surprising: the official system requirements <a href="https://wccftech.com/dragon-age-the-veilguard-has-quite-low-pc-requirements/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">are</a> fairly low. Perhaps that's because the game focuses on smaller and more linear environments compared to the open world-like zone of Dragon Age: Inquisition.</p>
<p>This may also play a part in something I discovered from the developers: Dragon Age: The Veilguard will offer ray tracing on consoles, too, specifically on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X (not S). They couldn't provide more details, sadly.</p>
<p>To accommodate the consoles' far inferior ray tracing capabilities, BioWare could perhaps focus just on reflections, which are the most obvious improvement of the two (although I really like the more grounded look provided by ray traced ambient occlusion). That's just speculation, though; we'll have to wait for the official info to know exactly what kind of ray tracing console users can expect. It shouldn't be too long, with the game due to <a href="https://wccftech.com/dragon-age-the-veilguard-to-launch-on-october-31/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">launch</a> in slightly more than two months.</p>

It’s a fate all too often reserved for bright, colorful, fun-first games that don’t obey the industry’s furrowed brow of grimdark severity. Well, apart from the ones with Pokémon in them. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196470" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Week In Games: Reignited Rivalries And More New Releases" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="123" data-playlist="196470,195922,196345" data-current="196470"><div><p>The Week In Games: Reignited Rivalries And More New Releases</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196470/196470_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196470/196470_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196470/196470_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196470/196470_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/22020.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p><em>Revenge of the Savage Planet</em> takes the explosively bright and cheerful nature of the original and makes it bigger, brighter, bouncier, changes to third-person, and then uses all that to tell a satirical parable of the state of modern capitalism and the games industry.<br></p><p>There’s a reason for that latter twist. Developers Raccoon Logic, who were once developers Typhoon Studios, have been through some shit. At the height of Google’s extravagant and wildly overconfident plans for disastrous streaming service Stadia, the company bought Typhoon as an in-house developer, before unceremoniously “spitting us back out” (as co-founder Alex Hutchinson, former creative director on <em>Far Cry 4 </em>and <em>Assassin’s Creed III</em> says during our hands-on demo) a few months later. In order to retain the rights to their <em>Savage Planet</em> IP, they sold the first game to publishers 505 Games such that they don’t see a penny of its sales, and…well, you can see why the game pitches itself as set “in a future knocked off its axis by corporate greed and stupidity.”<br></p><p>So it is with quite some triumph that both Hutchinson and co-founder Reid Schneider (executive producer on <em>Mad Max</em>, <em>Arkham Origins</em>, and <em>Army of Two</em>) declared that this new, far larger, far more ambitious sequel is being self-published.<br></p><p>Like the original game, <em>Return to the Savage Planet</em> is a sprawling, 3D Metroidvania set on a bonkers planet (or in this case, four planets), populated by wonderfully bizarre creatures to be shot at, kicked, or this time, captured and taken to your base to be kept in pens and, er, experimented upon.<br></p><p>Set in the same universe, but in a different time and setting, your space exploring company was recently bought by a large multinational corporation, Altar, who then sent you on a deep-space exploratory mission one hundred years’ flight away. However, 20 years into your cryo-sleep, you realize that the work is “expensive and difficult, so decide to get out of the sector entirely.” Yeah, it’s not exactly subtle.</p><figure id="" data-id="f6ff7840956937528735bc9339c9860d" data-recommend-id="image://f6ff7840956937528735bc9339c9860d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Two astronauts stand on a glowing purple platform." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Two astronauts stand on a glowing purple platform." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Raccoon Logic</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="f6ff7840956937528735bc9339c9860d" data-recommend-id="image://f6ff7840956937528735bc9339c9860d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Two astronauts stand on a glowing purple platform." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><h2 id="h79540"><a id=""></a><strong><em>Revenge Of The Savage Planet </em>demo</strong></h2><p>When you land on the planet you were supposed to be exploring, you learn that you were made redundant 80 years ago, and all the equipment and buildings and items you needed have been scattered across different planets. As Hutchinson put it, “One thing I’ve discovered is that satire and science fiction are never about the future, they’re always about right now.”<br></p><p>You then have to reach all that equipment and gather everything you need to rebuild a spaceship in order to return to Earth for your revenge. This is done through third-person exploration, with an ever-growing suite of abilities that allow you to reach previously impossible ledges, or break down sealed doors—you know the Metroidvania drill.<br></p><p>What makes <em>Savage Planet</em> stand out is just how plain <em>weird</em> it all is. This is a game where you fight hostile creatures by squirting them with a water gun until they absorb so much liquid they expand into vast platforms to jump on, or you leave trails of goo toward a host of slimes (here translucent cubes containing a wealth of rolling googly eyes) and then set it on fire, which might accidentally burn a larger, meaner beast who wakes up another bunch of critters, and suddenly you’re flailing to cope with a mad onslaught before running, jumping, and knee-sliding your way out of trouble.<br></p><p>As you play, more planets will be unlocked, with their own biomes and unique sets of creatures. You’ll also be collecting parts for building and improving your own home, decorating it with furniture and features sent ahead by Altar, their defining feature being that all are utterly impractical and functionally useless. (Rather brilliantly, you have to buy these with a currency found as you explore, Altar willing to still take your money for pointless gubbins, but not to make any attempt to rescue you.) At a certain point you’ll be exploring a whole little village of temporary homes, once intended for those who were to follow you, now never to be filled.<br></p><p>During the demo, played by the game’s lead producer, chaos often ensued, which just added to the sequel’s allure. And that chaos is apparently even more fun in the new co-op modes, whether played remotely or in splitscreen, where your buddy goofing and getting you into a whole heap of trouble creates all the right sorts of fights. But, importantly, these are escapable situations, not amusing game overs.<br></p><p>The third-person view has necessitated a few changes. The most crucial being you can no longer slap everything in the game, which just didn’t work in this new perspective. So now you can kick everything instead. It also offers a pile of new visual gags, not least the absolutely hilarious jogging and running animations, with ludicrously thrusted arms and legs that made me laugh every time I saw them. There will also be a collection of suits to wear, each treading dangerously close to others’ IP. After I had nerdily noticed a <em>Star Trek VI</em> reference Hutchinson made about some of the enemies having their gonads on their knees, he asked for a <em>Star Trek</em> red shirt uniform. I asked why the character didn’t immediately get killed? Before the question was over, Hutchinson interrupted me to say, “You will at launch! Put this outfit on and you’re immediately dead! Before we bring you back to life to carry on.” This new perspective was also chosen because it worked better for the platforming, not just for funsies.<br></p><p>Talking of which, the 30-person company (“How are you managing to keep the team from bloating bigger?” I asked. “By not having any money,” Alex Hutchinson replied) is putting the welfare of its developers ahead of the game’s production. There’s been no crunch, and there are no plans to ever crunch, although entering the last six months of development will likely stress-test this resolve. But this is a company that has risen phoenix-like from the ashes of corporate idiocy, and seems determined to now do things on their own terms. Let’s be clear—it’s not normal in this industry to be quite so honest about their disastrous interactions with massive corporations, and the freedom to do so is clearly being relished.<br></p><p>From my short but superbly entertaining glimpses of <em>Return to the Savage Planet</em>, it seems like this is being channelled for good, the larger themes containing the satirical venom, no spite reaching the gleeful silliness and rock-solid action of playing the game moment to moment. Unless, er, look, I’m really not sure what they meant by experimenting on captured creatures.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The 1.0 release will include Diplomacy's full story campaign, which includes three factions, six possible endings, and more than 25 missions. The developers estimate that a single playthrough will take around 30 hours.
</p>
<p>In his <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/diplomacy-is-not-an-option-review">Early Access review</a>, Steve Hogarty compared Diplomacy Is Not An Option to one of those fake games you see advertised on Instagram, only real. The scale of its enemy armies, the godlike power to destroy them with divine rays and meteor strikes, and the general sense that the game is less interested in tactical city construction than giddy spectacle.
</p>
<blockquote>But what the game lacks in variation it makes up for in its finely tuned and scratchcard-like approach to compulsive play. The cartoonish low-poly visuals and punchy sound effects make building out your expanding fortress an irresistible pleasure to be repeated over and over again, like scratching an itch somewhere deep inside your own skull. Assigning a few cohorts of crossbowmen to your towers and watching them effortlessly obliterate an approach wave of angry peasants is soothing, a cool balm for the mind, like slowly pushing your hoover of an especially dirty bit of carpet and hearing the crackle of debris clattering up the tube. Mmm.</blockquote>
<p>Which honestly sounds fine to me. It's been on my to-play list ever since, and I remain to give it a try now it's got more variety and polish.

Narrated by Miranda Otto who played Éowyn in the movies, <em>War of the Rohirrim</em> takes place 183 years prior to Frodo’s journey to destroy the One Ring and tells the story of Rohan’s fight for survival against a rival nation of Dunlendings.</p><p>Here’s the trailer:</p><p>The footage shows Helm Hammerhand (Cox) meeting with a rival king to discuss the marriage of their children, but when insults are hurled and honor is tarnished, a messy brawl leaves the Dunlending king dead. His son Wulf (Luke Pasqualino) pledges revenge while Hèra (Gaia Wise), Hammerhand’s daughter and Wulf’s would-be betrothed, tries to navigate political terrain dominated by men. The resulting battle will double as an origin story for Helm’s Deep, the stronghold made famous in the climax of <em>The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers</em>. </p><p><em>The War of the Rohirrim</em> was originally supposed to come out earlier this year but hit delays in 2023 as a result of the SAG-AFTRA strike. It’s directed by Kenji Kamiyama, best known most recently for the animated series <em>Ultraman</em>, <em>Star Wars: Visions</em>, and<em> Blade Runner: Black Lotus</em>. Instead of going with the divisive rotoscoping method Ralph Bakshi used for his original 1978 animated <em>The Lord of the Rings</em> movie, <em>War of the Rohirrim </em>was first made in 3D, with artists then using that to translate scenes into traditional 2D animation. </p><p>The movie is only coming to theaters at the moment, with no streaming plans on Max or any other service currently announced. More details are expected in October at this year’s New York Comic Con. </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Eternal Strands' new trailer debuted at the <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-gamescom-2024-show-will-be-big-xbox-insider-says-plenty-of-stuff-wasnt-shown-during-showcase/">Xbox Showcase</a> at Gamescom 2024. Yellow Brick Games revealed a brand-new gameplay trailer today, with narration from Chief Creative Officer Mike Laidlaw. This trailer gives players an insight into what they can expect from this third-person action-adventure fantasy game. This is Yellow Brick Games' first title, and it's a hugely ambitious one with a lush and vibrant world.</p>
<p><iframe title="101 Gameplay Trailer | Eternal Strands" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/AHxtabO0hj8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Eternal Strands occurs in a fully interactive world where players venture into the Enclave. The world has many harsh environments and highly unpredictable weather conditions, including flash freezes and heat waves, which can be devastating to both the landscapes and the players.</p>
<p>The main challenge for the player to complete is beating all nine towering bosses that roam freely through the Enclave. Players will additionally be introduced to something called Epic, the Ark of Stricken Earth, a dangerous entity that can cause significant harm to the players. However, players can utilize this and benefit from harvesting strands from them, which will help them gain new magical powers that can help them on their journey.</p>
<p>Players can craft and reforge their gear, allowing them to tailor the experience to their liking and create a play style that fits them in Eternal Strands. The new Eternal Strands trailer at the Xbox Showcase also revealed the Weaverband, Brynn's unique skilled base camp characters.</p>
<p>In Eternal Strands, you play as Brynn and are joined by fully-voiced companions that can help you on your journey.</p>
<p>These characters are voiced by well-known actors you would have heard in other games and media. The characters are the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Brynn, the Point - Voiced by Mei Mac</li>
<li>Oria, the Mentor - Voiced by Pandora Colin</li>
<li>Sola, the Smith - Voiced by Luyanda Unati Lewis-Nyawo</li>
<li>Sevastyan, the Smith's Apprentice - Voiced by Kris W. Laudrum</li>
<li>Laen, the Lorekeeper - Voiced by Robyn Holdaway</li>
<li>Casmyn, the Quartermaster - Voiced by&nbsp; Rebecca Hanssen</li>
<li>Dahm, the Enchanter - Voiced by Alex Jordan</li>
</ul>
<p>Players will get to forge bonds with members of the Weaverband, and they can help Brynn with their expedition by giving them helpful gear and guiding her in her decision-making as she uncovers the mysteries and profound secrets of the Enclave.</p>
<p>If Eternal Strands is a game that you are looking forward to, make sure to wishlist it on your chosen platform. The game will be arriving on PC, Xbox Series X|S, and PlayStation 5, with the game due to be released in 2025. Currently, there is no set release date, but <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1491410/Eternal_Strands/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the page for the game</a> is available for intrigued people to explore.</p>

			<p>Early access for <a href="https://wccftech.com/world-of-warcraft-the-war-within-wows-most-ambitious-story-arc-to-date-launches-august-26-pre-orders-live-now/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">World of Warcraft: The War Within</a> is live now for those who purchased the Epic Edition. As part of the launch push, Blizzard invited Wccftech and a couple of colleagues from other publications to a roundtable Q&amp;A with Associate Art Director Tina Wang and Lead Encounter Designer Michael Nuthals, who answered a great many questions on art, raids, dungeons, and more pertaining to the tenth expansion pack for the acclaimed MMORPG (which is also about to celebrate its 20th anniversary). You can find the full transcript below.</p>
<p><iframe title="Official Trailer: Powers Within | World of Warcraft | The War Within" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8E3VRgrQ7Ko?start=15&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p><strong>Heather Newman (PC Gamer/Forbes): I'll pitch a question to Tina. In terms of the art direction for The War Within, I think folks have talked a lot about Hallowfall and some of the cool things that are happening there. I would love to hear from you about Ringing Deeps and the efforts that you specifically made to make that zone feel perhaps a little bit less oppressive and cavern-like than recent underground zones that we've had.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Tina Wang:</strong> Absolutely. The Ringing Deeps is a fun one because it is the first zone where we go underground, right? You start at the top and then go to the Ringing Deeps. We did want to meet that subterranean fantasy to some degree where you're creating the sense of caverns, but again, not create something that's super oppressive or claustrophobic to the player. We initially described it as a bit of a mix of Black Rock Depths plus Maraudon. These are some traditional places that maybe some vanilla World of Warcraft players would have recognized.</p>
<p>But there's this idea that there's tons of Earthen industry embedded in this space, and we're constantly looking for ways to create atmosphere and light sources. So in those spaces, we added tons of lava falls, there's these giant buildings, and also in a lot of the places of the Ringing Deeps, if you look up, you'll see that there's these layers of rock that lead to a brightness above. It's this idea that because you're in the first layer, you are close to the surface.</p>
<p>We also created these locations that feel like cenotes. There are incredible pictures of massive underground caves with greenery, mists, and moss, and we really wanted to put that out there for players to experience. So you get the lava, the nature aspect of things, and we really love how we mesh that together.</p>
<p><strong>Kazuma Hashimoto (Siliconera): This is actually an encounter-specific question. I'm a very new adopter of World of Warcraft; I started playing last year. I did a lot of Savage raiding in Final Fantasy XIV 14. I've noticed that going into the Mythic tier for World of Warcraft, things can be hard to understand without addons or some sort of visual indicator.</strong></p>
<p><strong>I'm wondering if the team has considered or designed these new raids and encounters with the consideration that you might have an overlap of new players coming in from other MMOs. What's being done to accommodate those new players, whether it be making things more accessible without addons (I don't play with addons) or better legibility in terms of raid mechanics?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Michael</strong> <strong>Nuthals:</strong> Yeah, this is something that we on the encounter team take really seriously. We really want our players to be able to understand the mechanics that are happening. We have some conventions, right? There's a swirl on the ground. That means, maybe, don't stand here. It might be bad real soon. Or, there's this visual that looks almost there's like a fire coming out of the middle of it, but it's pulsing away from it. That means clump up because it's going to split the damage. So we're trying to create consistent language to communicate with the players.</p>
<p>One piece of feedback we consistently hear is that they should be able to read those visuals against the background of the art itself and make sure they pop. For Nerub-ar Palace and all of the dungeons, we've actually worked with our visual effects team and our dungeon art team to identify what our color palette is going to be for this boss.</p>
<p>Is this boss going to use a lot of fire and lightning attacks? We probably shouldn't use like really matching floor textures, right? So, really, letting those things stand out and pop against it. We also talk a lot about communicating over a lot of different channels. We want to have a cool audio effect along with maybe a raid warning along with the visual so that players can see what's happening and learn that language and then be able to react to that language.</p>
<p>One of the things I love is being able to learn how a fight plays out. Understand how to pull the boss, wiping because we didn't know we ran into something we couldn't overcome, learning how to overcome that, working with my team and then progressing past that the next time. So making failure clear is really important to us.</p>
<figure><figcaption>'For The War Within, one of the things that we did in Hallowfall was something that we had never done before. Hallowfall has this giant glowing crystal placed on one side of the zone, and there's a falloff to it because it's not like sunlight, right? With sunlight, you get this very direct light. Everything that it hits casts a shadow. So something that we had to do here was make it so that it was only getting the direct light in a certain falloff around it so that we were still able to create the depth of the caverns. We also added some improvements that helped us achieve that glow from the crystal. I think that's one of those things that maybe if you aren't looking for it, you don't know that notice it's like a graphic improvement, but it really helps make Hallowfall feel as unique as it is.'</figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>ALESSIO PALUMBO (WCCFTECH): Is there any brand new graphics effect that you have introduced with The War Within or perhaps improved specifically for this expansion that you are proud of?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Tina Wang:</strong> With World of Warcraft, with every expansion we're trying to add new improvements. I know people like to comment that it's an older engine, but it's always being evolved. For The War Within specifically, one of the things that we did in Hallowfall was something that we had never done before. Hallowfall has this giant glowing crystal placed on one side of the zone, and there's a falloff to it because it's not like sunlight, right?</p>
<p>With sunlight, you get this very direct light. Everything that it hits casts a shadow. So something that we had to do here was make it so that it was only getting the direct light in a certain falloff around it so that we were still able to create the depth of the caverns, feeling like there's that darkness to it, creating that sense of being near the light is what is so important to the Arathi and where it's safe.</p>
<p>We also added some improvements that helped us achieve that glow from the crystal. I think that's one of those things that maybe if you aren't looking for it, you don't know that notice it's like a graphic improvement, but it really helps make Hallowfall feel as unique as it is.</p>
<p><strong>Heather Newman (PC Gamer/Forbes): Michael, as we're looking at the new 18-month timeline that was sketched out for us for the expansions that will make up the three-part Worldsoul Saga, one of the questions that I hear all the time is from raiders wondering, okay, does this mean that we're still getting what has become the traditional three tiers of raiding plus some kind of end of expansion kind of cycle, or does this mean that we're talking about the possibility maybe of cutting back to two or some other combination? Can you settle that for us?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Michael</strong> <strong>Nuthals: </strong>I can't do that today. I don't want to talk too much about the future, but I can say we have a very exciting Nerub-ar raid coming up here. Players will be able to take the fight directly to Queen Ansurek, a surrogate of Xal'atath. I don't know if you had a chance to see the 2D animation that was recently released featuring Xal'atath behind me here.</p>
<p>Being able to go and delve deep into the Nerubian kind of culture and seeing how they fight and being able to square off against the queen of their people is a very cool opportunity. I'm very excited to hear how players the reception that we're going to get from that. We're also adding an opportunity for players who aren't as comfortable venturing in with a group.</p>
<p>We're giving players the option to see the end boss through what we're calling story mode, and this is a chance for players to be able to play along with a couple of NPC buddies and really encounter Ansurek and be able to play the story and experience this end that they may have only been able to see maybe through third party websites in the past. Now, they can get in there and really play the story and be able to defeat Ansurek themselves. Maybe it gives them the courage to jump in on LFR Normal and see it with a group of friends. That's what I'm most excited about. We've got some cool stuff coming in raiding.</p>
<p><strong>Kazuma Hashimoto (Siliconera): This is an art question, actually. In that fantastic CGI trailer for The War Within, we see the Harronir and the dwarves and everything. I want to talk a little bit about what the team does to portray these cultures and really add a sense of depth to them. For example, the trolls were doing a tribal dance that you would typically see associated with tribes in South Africa. What real life inspirations has the art team taken and injected into World of Warcraft for this expansion?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Tina Wang:</strong> When we work on expansions, when we work on new cultures, we have this really cool group, BlizzU, and so we get researchers or experts in their specific fields to come and chat with us about their area of expertise. For instance, for The War Within, we initially had one about exploring caves, and we recently had another about crystals. When it comes to different cultures, those are also cases where we consult experts in various spaces to hear from them as well.</p>
<p><strong>Kazuma Hashimoto(Siliconera): How deep does that go in relation to what Blizzard does to really nail the potential cultural sensitivity within portraying specific cultures? For example, how involved are these consultants? Do they look at art assets? Do they look at narrative things to help add and provide feedback?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Tina Wang:</strong> Depending on what it is, there's a variety there. Certainly across Blizzard, especially in games like Overwatch, where it's very specific to a culture that they choose to represent of the real world, it gets very deep. Whereas on World of Warcraft, oftentimes we're taking bits of inspiration from places. We're never trying to represent a culture very directly, right? But we do want to make sure that when we take inspiration, we are doing that from an informed place.</p>
<p><strong>Heather Newman (PC Gamer/Forbes): I'll jump in on the crystals thing. Do you have a specific example, something you heard during the consultation, and you were like, oh, this is great. We can build this in here.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Tina Wang:</strong> Oh, I think that happens all the time. For instance, another one that we did during The War Within was a virtual forge tour because there were a lot of forges in Earthen culture. With arachnophobia, this was another one where we consulted an arachnophobia expert, so we added this accessibility mode in World of Warcraft that changes spider-like beasts. We received a lot of information that informed some testing that we did, such as the angle of the legs, the number of legs, the presence of fangs, and things like that.</p>
<p>One of the examples was that the crabs, when it comes to testing the phobia, even though they seem spider-like to the casual observer, when it comes to phobias, it makes a huge difference. Then we also reinforced that message through user testing as well.</p>
<p><b>Heather Newman (PC Gamer/Forbes): Who was it, or how was it, that the idea of replacing with crabs specifically came up and not some other creature?</b></p>
<p><strong>Tina Wang:</strong> It was because of that initial consultation with the arachnophobia expert of crabs specifically. Their shape, the angle of their legs, and the way they move don't trigger it. We did some testing, and also, anecdotally, people were saying, oh, crabs would be less scary. We had so many of those models, right? We already have crabs. We already have spiders. It was very easy for us to do those tests.</p>
<p><strong>ALESSIO PALUMBO (WCCFTECH): I wanted to ask about dungeons, specifically follower dungeons. I understand there are four in The War Within, correct? Do you have plans to add more post-launch, and also, do you have any plans to expand the possibility of using NPC followers to regular dungeons at some point if the community asks for it?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Michael</strong> <strong>Nuthals: </strong>First of all, I am very excited about follower dungeons. This is a really cool opportunity that we introduced in season four of Dragonflight of being able to do a dungeon solo and then having NPC buddies help you make your way through the dungeon. Similar to story mode, this is an opportunity for players who don't feel comfortable maybe going into a group as a way of being able to engage with all the cool storytelling we're doing in dungeons.</p>
<p>Tina's team makes awesome stuff, and we want every player to be able to see all that cool stuff, while our team makes really cool, engaging gameplay. We want players to interact with that in a fun and engaging way. I'm just really excited about being able to open that up to a broader audience.</p>
<p>As for future plans, I'm really curious to see how players engage with it. I'm excited to hear what players want, and then we can make choices based on what we hear from our players.</p>
<p><strong>Heather Newman (PC Gamer/Forbes): Quick question for you, Michael, that almost plays off of that previous question. As we look at the new structure for Mythic Plus and the idea that above level 10 folks are no longer going to be seeing those cool visual and gameplay-related affixes, are you feeling any angst there about the fact that the folks who play Mythic Plus dungeons the most are, at some point, relatively quickly, one would assume, not going to be seeing your work in those specific spaces at all?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Michael</strong> <strong>Nuthals: </strong>Yeah, great question. We're really targeting and reacting to player feedback. As we hit keystone level 12, Xal'atath removes the affixes, and you're left with a combination of tyrannical and fortified. The feedback we've been hearing is that players who are engaging with content at that level want that repeatability. There's a desire to be able to master the dungeon, whereas the players who are engaging between keystone levels 2 and 10 are players who we're injecting that variety for because that's what we have shown so far.</p>
<p>Those players are interested in getting that different experience week over week, and we think most players are going to be living in that world where they're getting that variety every week. As we designed the Mythic Plus system, we're catering to two different segments of the audience.</p>
<p><strong>Tina</strong> <strong>Wang:</strong> In terms of thinking about the affixes, I see them more as just a layer on top, right? They're a layer on top of what I, maybe with bias, see as the star of World of Warcraft, which is really the world, these bespoke places that we built. Then, as Mike mentioned previously, by creating follower dungeons and story modes, it allows so many different players to experience the time we invest into crafting these locations and allows us to invest more time into them, too, as we know more players are able to see them.</p>
<div>
<p><strong><span>Kazuma Hashimoto (Siliconera): T</span>his is more like a generalist question. You mentioned that World of Warcraft is adding the follower aspect to dungeons where you can run through with NPCs and everything, like a story mode. This is a hot topic in MMO communities about MMOs becoming more focused on single player experiences. Do you think that this will potentially impact the community in a negative way and prevent players from more or less cultivating the communities that they've had in MMOs by implementing this feature into dungeons?</strong></p>

<p><strong>Tina</strong> <strong>Wang:</strong> With the follower dungeons, it's really more of a way to experience a story. For instance, in terms of the rewards that you can get, if you're a reward-focused player, that's not going to resolve that avenue for you. You mentioned Delves in terms of a new track of content that we've added to our reward track, where, yes, we are trying to look at all the different ways that different players like to play the game and create segments of content that work well for them.</p>

<p>With raids, we have a very large-scale, organized multi-hour content. With dungeons, it's more like a 30-minute experience, but it's an organized five-person set group, whereas Delves is much more open-ended and flexible because we already see players who play the game that way. We want to give those players a way to continue to feel like they can be part of that endgame reward track. Something I'm excited about is when it comes to heroic raiding some players do choose other avenues of gearing up for it. A lot of times, what we've heard is that players felt forced to do Mythic Plus dungeons, even though that wasn't for them. They're like, I like these 20 friends that I hang out with weekly, but I don't want to find five people and do this stressful experience. So we think Delves will benefit group content in that way as well.</p>

</div>
<div dir="ltr">
<figure><figcaption>'I'm incredibly excited to see players reach and defeat Queen Ansurek. That's an encounter that is, I think, really cool and different and something the players haven't seen yet because we've played our cards close to the chest. It's really exciting to me because that encounter is layered. There's kind of like different platforms and how players are going to traverse through the space is different than we've ever done before in World of Warcraft. It's a different way of progressing an encounter through this verticality, really inspired by the spiders that the Nerubians are based on.'</figcaption></figure>
</div>
<p><strong>ALESSIO PALUMBO (WCCFTECH): Let me ask about raids specifically. Is there anything specific that you're excited for raiders to, to find out about the world within and that you were able to introduce or improve or previous raids from earlier expansions?</strong></p>
<div>

<p><strong>Michael</strong> <strong>Nuthals: </strong>I'm incredibly excited to see players reach and defeat Queen Ansurek. That's an encounter that is, I think, really cool and different and something the players haven't seen yet because we've played our cards close to the chest. We're not showing that on any of our public playtests. Our internal QA team is tuning it right now. They're working on polishing it up. It's really exciting to me because that encounter is layered. There's kind of like different platforms and how players are going to traverse through the space is different than we've ever done before in World of Warcraft. It's a different way of progressing an encounter through this verticality, really inspired by the spiders that the Nerubians are based on. They can climb up walls and they can get around in ways that maybe we, as the players, can't. So it's interesting to see how we're going to be able to get around that space to keep up with Queen Ansurek. That's one encounter I'm super excited about.</p>

<p>Another encounter I'm really excited about is in one of our dungeons, the Dawnbreaker. The final boss of that is this kind of Nerubian beast, like a mutated dragonfly thing. It's really cool. Players, as they're doing that dungeon, chase it down and are able to defeat it. But they don't slay it, so the thing retreats. As players make their way through the Nerub-ar palace, as they make their way deep into the Queen's lair, they come across this unassuming bridge. Could be anything under there. That's when the flyer appears and it's back with a vengeance, ready to take out the players. So that's a really cool space for fighting on long bridge and you're traversing across the platform as the boss moves around the space. It's a really cool, engaging way, and it lets players flex their movement abilities and get around the space in interesting ways.</p>

<p><strong>ALESSIO PALUMBO (WCCFTECH): Do you believe these raids will be tougher to beat? Will hardcore players take longer to beat them, or do you expect a similar amount of time to do the World First kill?</strong></p>

<p><strong>Michael</strong> <strong>Nuthals: </strong>We have our own internal tuning targets that we're hoping to shoot for. We really want a satisfying experience for the players who are doing the race to World First. The folks who are doing Mythic should have a satisfying experience. The race to cutting-edge Heroic-level guilds, right? They should have a fun experience, right? And feel like they have a chance to get their toe into the raid and then meet challenges and overcome those challenges. We're hoping for a really well-paced, executed experience there.</p>

<p><strong>Kazuma Hashimoto (Siliconera): I saw that half-elf customization was datamined for The War Within. If that is a real thing, will we actually see more character customizations across the board for biracial characters? Given that we do have a pretty healthy amount of biracial characters in the story now, and one being featured prominently within The War Within.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Tina</strong> <strong>Wang:</strong> I'm not gonna call it half-elf because we think of it more as just a touch of elven heritage. They're not half-elves, necessarily. But that is something that we've discussed, whether that's something that we do give to the player. Nothing to share today, though, about additional customizations. I do want to real quick, though, shout out one of my favorite parts of the Arathi, which is that they have lynxes, which is also that fallback to the touch of mixing and hanging out with elves in the past.</p>

<p><strong>Heather Newman (PC Gamer/Forbes): As we discuss the differences between Delves and follower dungeons, what is the dividing line between those two things? You could see a follower dungeon as this flexible solo type of content and one could easily see how you could bring in multiple friends or no friends at all and have your little NPC buddies or Bran in the case of Delves fo</strong><strong>r this season that will move along with you. But talk to them about whether there is a deep philosophical difference in where you see these two avenues of content heading, or is it kind of two sides of the same coin?</strong></p>

<p><strong>Michael</strong> <strong>Nuthals: </strong>When I think of follower dungeons, I think of them as a chance for players to experience the story of The War Within, right? The rookery dungeon has particular story beats we want to tell players that will lead them to discover some things about the Earthen and lead them to the story of the Ringing Deeps.</p>

<p>Delves are an adventure. We're gonna go on an adventure, set like the tier levels, so there's difficulty levels, and then once we enter into that space, there might be kobolds in it, there might be goblins in it, there might be rats with really big fangs. It's that type of thing where we're gonna have a different experience each time with maybe different environmental effects, and different events, and different bosses. That variety is the goal of Delves.</p>

<p><strong>Tina Wang:</strong> One of the key pieces here is having a progression track. Delve-focused players are catered towards players who want to play either solo or in a flexible-size group, and they'll be able to earn better rewards than those types of players have ever been able to. When I talk progression path, it's really about that weekly endgame where every week, you look forward to opening a Great Vault.</p>

<p><strong>Michael</strong> <strong>Nuthals:</strong> One of the features I like about it is that players can really push it. We have this Delve, which is similar to our end bosses. We don't test that on our beta or PTR. That's going to be the experience that players are going to be able to do once the game goes live. We've been inspired by previous solo challenges like the Mage Tower when imagining what this could be, a solo progression where you can crank the tier level up so high that you can end up doing this really cool boss encounter.</p>

<div dir="ltr">
<figure><figcaption>'I think the key here is with Torghast, our very power progression-focused players felt like they needed to do it, whereas for Delves... We have a group of players who loved doing Torghast and that's the type of people who we want to make sure we're allowing them an avenue for that endgame progression system. At the same, we do not say, hey, everyone, you have to do a Delve.'</figcaption></figure>
</div>
<p><strong>Heather Newman (PC Gamer/Forbes): One of the things about Delve specifically that strikes a lot of people is this feels a little bit like Torghast 2.0. There was some disappointment, I think, in the amount of effort that went into designing Torghast, only to find that players went through it once or as required and then maybe didn't return in the numbers that folks were hoping they would return to, because it feels like there's some real similarities there, certainly some of the gameplay mechanics in terms of powers and traps, </strong><strong>at least similarly structured as they did the first time through. But the reward level, Tina, as you say, has been tuned up quite a bit compared to Torghast, which was primarily cosmetics.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Tina</strong> <strong>Wang</strong>: I think the key here is with Torghast, our very power progression-focused players felt like they needed to do it, whereas for Delves... We have a group of players who loved doing Torghast and that's the type of people who we want to make sure we're allowing them an avenue for that endgame progression system. At the same, we do not say, hey, everyone, you have to do a Delve.</p>

<p><strong>Michael</strong> <strong>Nuthals:</strong> We really want folks to be able to find the pieces of World of Warcraft that engage them and let them explore the world in a way that they're comfortable with. We want to have an opportunity for everyone to find their place in World of Warcraft.</p>

<p><strong>Tina Wang: </strong>It's a big piece of really listening to our players, seeing what they're doing, and meeting them where they're at. That's also another piece of why we chose to make this really major technological investment into Warbands, changing the infrastructure of how we've structured the game really, because we see that nowadays players play multiple characters. It's very common.</p>

<p><strong>Kazuma Hashimoto: I wanted to ask about the collaborative nature between the art team and the encounter team. You mentioned how those bespoke, beautiful environments for each dungeon are created and what goes into the environmental storytelling of each dungeon because that's something that I really love about World of Warcraft so far. I'm going through Wrath, I'm going through Shadowlands, and I'm just like, all of this stuff is actually story-relevant to everything I'm playing and actually has some sort of nod to something that goes as far back as Warcraft 1 or Warcraft 3.</strong></p>

<p><strong>Michael</strong> <strong>Nuthals:</strong> Ultimately, the world of Azeroth is the star of World of Warcraft. It's in the name. So making the world shine and feel like a place that makes sense and belongs and has history is really important. As we go through the process of building a dungeon, we want to pick the spaces that have significance. We want to go to the cool places of the world and delve in there and defeat the challenges within. We find those cool opportunities to tell a story through not just narrative or visuals, but through combat mechanics. What you're seeing, who's there, all these things are important to us as we ideate where we want to take the players. Where are our adventures going to lead us?</p>

<p><strong>Tina</strong>&nbsp;<strong>Wang:</strong> Yeah, when we kick off Dungeons and Raids, we start, for the most part, with the story. There's a narrative reason why we're going to this place, who we might encounter there, and we try to factor all that in, even to the degree of foreshadowing future things. You mentioned Shadowlands, for instance. In the Sanctum of Domination, there's a piece of one of those bosses in that raid. If you actually look out the window, you see that he's pulled a piece of a continent from a different location of Shadowlands and that location was actually a piece of Zereth Mortis, which is in our next patch. We're constantly adding these details to inject more of that storytelling.</p>

<div dir="ltr">
<figure><figcaption>'What I can say is that the Shadow Priest already has hints of the Void coming in from the edges. Xal'atath here started as a Shadow Priest artifact in Legion. I believe it was the Blade of the Black Empire and through the Shadow Priest and the Whispers, and through the events of Battle for Azeroth, we released Xal'atath from that blade. So there's a lot of connection there between the kind of that priest order hall that's led us to the story that now is Xal'atath as we're starting to see it unfold in World of Warcraft: The War Within.'</figcaption></figure>
</div>
<p><strong>Kazuma Hashimoto (Siliconera): I have another follow-up question. One of the talent trees for, I believe it's the priest, almost pays homage to Xal'atath in the way that it's like a void priest, right? As someone who plays a Frost Death Knight, it's really cool that I get to cast Remorseless Winter and do all the animations Arthas does because I'm still stuck in Warcraft 3. Are we going to see potentially any of her skills make it into that specific talent tree? Are we going to be able to cast some of her skills or have things that pay homage to this really interesting boss?</strong></p>

</div>
<p><strong>Michael Nuthals:</strong> Who's to say as we go deeper into this, right? But what I can say is that the Shadow Priest already has hints of the Void coming in from the edges.</p>
<p>Xal'atath here started as a Shadow Priest artifact in Legion. I believe it was the Blade of the Black Empire and through the Shadow Priest and the Whispers, and through the events of Battle for Azeroth, we released Xal'atath from that blade. So there's a lot of connection there between the kind of that priest order hall that's led us to the story that now is Xal'atath as we're starting to see it unfold in World of Warcraft: The War Within.</p>
<p><strong>Tina</strong> <strong>Wang:</strong> There's a bit of that element that the flavor of Void that she uses, cosmic Void, is reflected in some of the abilities. So in that degree, yeah, artistically, visually.</p>
<p><strong>ALESSIO PALUMBO (WCCFTECH): I wanted to ask Tina about something art related, specifically whether the team has looked into potentially adding some additional cutting edge technologies. For example, with the Shadowlands expansion, you <a href="https://wccftech.com/amd-showcases-world-of-warcraft-shadowlands-ray-tracing-and-vrs-ahead-of-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">added</a> ray traced shadows to World of Warcraft, but that was a while ago. Is that something you are still looking into? Something else on that note is also support for HDR displays. Is that something you might be interested in adding in the future?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Tina Wang:</strong> So, there is nothing to announce today, but we are continuously looking at ways to improve the engine and the way that we do it. We're continuing to look into those things over time for sure. Sorry for no specific details.</p>
<p><strong>Heather Newman (PC Gamer/Forbes): This is a question again about Mythic Plus and specifically about representation. If you look at the very highest levels, clearly, there is a defined meta that settles in as the season progresses, and folks tend to lean towards playing that meta. But even considering that, there are certain specs and, in some cases, certain classes that don't show up. Which seems to indicate, at least to me, that probably classes are not perfectly balanced when it comes to play in Mythic Plus even setting aside that pack mentality. </strong></p>
<p><strong>How important is it to you as you think about the mechanics you design, as you think about the difficulty attributed to each of those mechanics that there is some kind of representation that is inclusive across all classes, and how much of it is, you know what, if they're playing at the title level, they've got to be able to play whatever fits the current suite of dungeons and that's just part of the gameplay?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Michael Nuthals:</strong> We really want to see good representation. We wanna give players opportunities. When we think about building mechanics, we're thinking about giving players a reason to hit all the cool buttons on their keyboard that the class designers have given them as an encounter designer building an encounter. That means that we should be offering challenges for everyone. The goal is that maybe one class is better at this mechanic or boss, right? Or maybe this affix encourages certain players or certain classes or specs to be better there. And that texture is what's important. It's making sure that no one class or spec is the quintessential best. But that you want to assemble a team of people who can be successful. That's ultimately the goal.</p>
<p><strong>Heather Newman (PC Gamer/Forbes): How successful do you feel like you've been?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Michael</strong> <strong>Nuthals:</strong> I think we've been pretty successful in tuning the bars where the damage meters lie. I think there's always room for improvement, and this is where we lean on our players. The Season 1 affix changes are a reaction to listening to player feedback and wanting to change something to help address some of the community's concerns. I think the most important thing is that we are listening and we're going to be tuning as we go in.</p>
<p>I'm just really excited for players to get in there so I can start listening. I always think of this first couple of weeks post-expansion as a chance to really listen to the players and start getting that feedback to help inform what kind of changes we want to make as we start to build the next cool stuff for our players. It's always that opportunity to just be informed and try and meet the players where they are.</p>
<p><strong>Tina</strong> <strong>Wang:</strong> Like you mentioned,&nbsp; the most important thing is that it's balanced for the vast majority of players. Then maybe there's outliers and that's something that should be discussed further, but as long as the bulk of the way that players play the game, as long as we get good representation in that front, I feel like that's most important.</p>
<p><strong>ALESSIO PALUMBO (WCCFTECH): Michael talked about community feedback. Since the pre-patch update for World of Warcraft: The War Within went live a few weeks ago, I wanted to ask what kind of feedback you got from the community about those features released as part of the pre-patch update.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Tina Wang:</strong> Yeah, there was a good amount of feedback on the pre-patch event, and we're really glad that we were able to respond as quickly as we did. It can sometimes be difficult for us to balance it in our internal testing and estimations of how quickly a huge horde of players is going to eliminate every mob in the area. It's an example of us paying very close attention to when stuff like that gets put out.</p>
<p><strong>ALESSIO PALUMBO (WCCFTECH): How did the community react to Warbands and dynamic flight so far?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Tina Wang:</strong> I think very positive on the Warbands. It's a huge quality of life improvement.</p>
<p><strong>Michael Nuthals:</strong> I was gonna say I love seeing folks riding around on their Ashes of Alar because we've been able to expand the set of mounts that are able to be used with skyriding. I saw an Ashes fly by me the other day. I was like, that's awesome. I better go kill Kael'thas again for the 30th time. It's really cool to soar through the old world, too and just like zip around on my - I tend to use a Griffin myself, as I play a lot of Dwarf. So, soaring on a Griffin, I'm channeling my inner Wildhammer dwarf. It's really cool. I love skyriding.</p>
<p><strong>Kazuma Hashimoto (Siliconera): I've been looking at a lot of community reception to previous expansions, specifically with Shadowlands, and all the gear that was available then, and all the transmogs, and in general player reception to what has been available. For The War Within, will players have access to more class-specific transmogs that actually represent that class? For example, Hunters having access to things that look more Hunter-like instead of just more generic plate armor and Priests having things that look closer to Priest roes and everything, especially with the inclusion of the Arathi.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Tina Wang:</strong> Oh, yeah, absolutely. Something that we did in World of Warcraft: The War Within with our tier sets is that they're all geared toward class fantasy instead of a specific raid theme. We're very excited because there are some really awesome themes out there. Like the Hunter, the tier set that we did for them, the theme of it is like a trophy hunter. They've got these awesome skulls and just like relics on the armor. Plus there's a hint of this green poison, which is a call to how Hunters have the serpent sting ability. We also have a Mage set that's like a Kirin Tor Mage. We want to lean into specific themes about the Mage.</p>
<p><strong>Heather Newman (PC Gamer/Forbes): I'll ask a follow-up question to something that you mentioned pretty early on, Michael, which is the design of visual and audio cues to help people understand what's happening in specifically raid encounters, I think. So, one of the things that has been a hot discussion topic over the past couple of tiers has been the use of private auras.</strong></p>
<p><strong>We just had a major shakeup in the API approach that's affecting both dungeons and rage just in the most recent patch push, which may be some oddity from transitioning between beta and launch, but it certainly got folks in a tizzy this morning. Talk to me about the philosophy in terms of how much you want people to have to rely on addons and is the encouragement at this point to say, hey, we want you guys to try things without them.</strong></p>
<p><b>Because it seems like the player-based response has been, we'll do that funky macro plus addon thing where people just push the button when they see stuff happen, and then it'll just be as if the addon could read it to begin with.</b></p>
<p><strong>Michael</strong> <strong>Nuthals:</strong> What a great topic. When we think about private auras, I think the ultimate goal is to encourage players to look at the world around them, take in the information, and make decisions based on what's happening in real time and when adding a private aura encourages enough consternation that players feel like they need to work around it, that's where we might re- evaluate the need for a private aura. For example Sometimes private or work really well.</p>
<p>For example, Blaze on for Rock is a great example of a private aura, but everybody understood that this giant line coming off of me is probably bad, and I don't want to stand in it. You know where folks needed to go to the macros to problem-solve, right? That's maybe an instance where we could reevaluate whether or not we're getting what we want out of it.</p>
<p>We want players to really be focused and have a good time playing the encounters and looking at the world and being in the world. Ideally, we would have players focused on just what kind of information they have in the game, but in a world of addons and weak auras and communication, we should, where it is egregious, meet the players where they are.</p>
<p><strong>Alessio Palumbo (WCCFTECH): An easy last question from me. I wanted to ask you which World of Warcraft: The War Within dungeon is your favorite and why.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Tina Wang:</strong> This is a very hard question! Probably the Dawnbreaker. I really think that I love the Arathi culture that we built, and then the airships themselves are just so cool. The fight itself is really unique too, where you get to fight out that new flyer creature, right? Where, so there's fun new animations for that as well. So yeah, again, I'm going to go with the Dawnbreaker.</p>
<p><strong>Michael Nuthals:</strong> I love all the dungeons. But if I have to pick one, I'm gonna go with Cinderbrew Meadery. It's probably the one I am gonna pick here. This is an Earthen kind of meadery that was taken over by goblins. We have the fun whimsy of goblins meeting the seriousness of the Earthen and there's there's Goblin bee cowboys, like riding fire bees that they're trying to turn into mead. There's like an ale elemental. It's just a ton of fun and that, to me, really leans into the humor that our wow.</p>
<p><strong>Heather Newman (PC Gamer/Forbes): One more quick yes or no question. Michael, are we going to see the return of Mythic-only phases for end bosses and raids anytime soon? </strong></p>
<p><strong>Michael Nuthals:</strong> I can't say right now. There's like to do them where it makes sense, right? Where we think that there's a cool story that we want to tell and there's a cool hook that we can use. Where they make sense is the goal there.</p>
<p><strong>Thank you for your time.</strong></p>
