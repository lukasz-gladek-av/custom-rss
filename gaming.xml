			<p>During the weekend, rumors started circulating online that Grand Theft Auto VI would be delayed to 2026, but it seems like they were not true, as confirmed today by an extremely reliable source.</p>
<p>Bloomberg's <a href="https://x.com/jasonschreier" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Jason Schreier</a> provided on X some additional information on the potential delay for Rockstar Games' highly anticipated open-world title, saying that six different Rockstar employees told him they haven't heard anything about a delay. However, it is too early to celebrate, as Grand Theft Auto VI is a big and ambitious game that could very well slip into 2026.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">The internet (and my DMs) blew up this weekend over a rumor that GTA VI is delayed. Good news is that six Rockstar employees all told me they have not heard of any delay. Bad news: it's a big, ambitious game and could very well slip! Too much time left to say anything definitive</p>
<p>— Jason Schreier (@jasonschreier) <a href="https://twitter.com/jasonschreier/status/1833152426989191400?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 9, 2024</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Back in May, Take-Two Interactive confirmed Grand Theft Auto VI would be released sometime during Fall 2025, but, just from the only trailer released so far and the<a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-document/"> information</a> that was gleaned from leaks and other sources, it's clear how the game is a very ambitious title that may require more development time than anticipated. No matter when it releases, however, the game is expected to be the <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-is-expected-to-be-the-biggest-entertainment-launch-of-all-time-but-a-performance-below-expectations-could-impact-the-entire-industry/">biggest entertainment launch of all time</a>, so it wouldn't be surprising for Rockstar Games to take more time to make sure the sixth entry in one of the most popular gaming series ever still active today will meet fans expectations to the fullest.</p>
<p>Grand Theft Auto VI is now in development for PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S. We will keep you updated on the game as soon as more come in on it, so stay tuned for all the latest news.</p>

			<p>Pearl Abyss, the developers of the long-running MMORPG <a href="https://wccftech.com/black-desert-online-announces-mass-pvp-event-war-of-the-roses/">Black Desert Online</a>, have started building up the hype for the upcoming expansion to the game Land of the Morning Light: Seoul. The expansion will be released on September 12 on PC via their client and Steam.</p>
<p>These videos will dive into the details of the expansion, such as the upcoming boss fights, the characters you will encounter, and the mythology of the expansion. In total, twelve videos will be released throughout the week, with some being before the official launch and some of them after. Currently, a video showcases some of the characters players can expect to see in Black Desert Online's new expansion.&nbsp; It's only 50 seconds long but introduces players to some beneficial characters they'll encounter.</p>
<p><iframe title="Meet the Cast of Seoul | New Region Update | Black Desert" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5XCaC3yUDdY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The following videos will be released throughout the release week. They will showcase raids, boss fights, and essential locations that players can explore in Seoul.</p>
<ul>
<li>Sovereign Weapon Preview: September 9</li>
<li>GM'S Gyeongbokgung Palace Tour: September 10</li>
<li>Land of the Morning Light: Seoul Official Boss Combat Trailer: September 12</li>
<li>Hwanghae &amp; Donghae Province Preview: September 14</li>
<li>Boss Battle Trailer - Party Raid: September 15</li>
<li>Sovereign Weapon Deep Dive: September 16</li>
<li>Gyeongbokgung Palace in Black Desert: September 17</li>
<li>Black Desert x Korean National Gugak Center (Donghae Province BGM): September 18</li>
<li>Black Desert x Korean National Gugak Center (City of Virtue BGM): September 18</li>
</ul>
<p>Although they all have their allocated dates, it has been noted that the video release schedule may be subject to change.</p>
<p>Land of the Morning Light: Seoul is a sequel to Land of the Morning Light Part 1. The new expansion offers new storylines and adventures for players to explore while experiencing the stunning backdrop of medieval Seoul, Korea.</p>
<p>On the official Black Desert Online website, you can find a banner that showcases the September 2024 roadmap. Currently, a Berserk collaboration with the game allows players to get the same armor as iconic characters from the manga and anime.</p>
<p>In addition to Land of the Morning Light - Seoul being released on September 12, players will also experience the addition of Sovereign Weapons, which releases on the same day. Past that, the Dosa Awakening will also be added to the game, marked as "Coming Soon."</p>
<p>The website also has a <a href="https://www.naeu.playblackdesert.com/en-US/News/Detail?groupContentNo=7477" target="_blank" rel="noopener">blog post</a> explaining what steps players need to take to prepare for the new Black Desert Online expansion, such as accepting and completing the preliminary quests that will take them to Seoul when the expansion releases.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/baldurs-gate-3-level-editor-new-mod</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/baldurs-gate-3-level-editor-and-more-unlocked-thanks-to-new-mod.975801/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/baldurs-gate-3-level-editor-new-mod<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A new&nbsp;<em>Baldur's Gate 3&nbsp;</em>mod has been released that grants access to the game's level editor and save editor functions, among other things, via the new modding toolkit provided as part of Patch 7.</p>
<p>The seventh major patch for Larian's critically-acclaimed RPG was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/baldurs-gate-3-patch-7-patch-notes">released last week</a>, and one of its major new features is a modding toolkit that lets you create your own spells, classes, and cosmetics, among other things.</p>
<p>Now, however, modder Siegfre has created a mod by the name of <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/12021?tab=description" rel="noopener" target="_blank">"BG3 Toolkit Unlocked"</a>, which, in Siegfre's own words, "unlocks all the disabled features and enables write permissions" for Larian's official&nbsp;<em>Baldur's Gate 3&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/baldurs-gate-3-mod-tools-september">modding toolkit</a>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/baldurs-gate-3-level-editor-mod-bg3-toolkit-unlocked.jpg?itok=IwONc-yT 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/baldurs-gate-3-level-editor-mod-bg3-toolkit-unlocked.jpg?itok=Fqq7RVKx 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>It might not look like the sexiest mod in the world, but BG3 Toolkit Unlocked lets you access&nbsp;<em>Baldur's Gate 3</em>'s level editor.</figcaption></figure><p>As well as level editing, you'll also be able to access a save editor to change values within your save files, plus more features. It's probably a good idea not to tinker with this stuff unless you're sure you know what you're doing, though.</p>
<p>All you'll need to install BG3 Toolkit Unlocked is a full install of&nbsp;<em>Baldur's Gate 3</em>, as well as "a working installation" of the game's mod toolkit. From there, here's a set of instructions to install and run the mod, courtesy of Siegfre themselves.</p>
<ul><li>Backup your "EditorFramework.dll" in "SteamLibrary/steamapps/common/Baldurs Gate 3 Toolkit".</li>
<li>Download "EditorFramework.dll".</li>
<li>Move the new "EditorFramework.dll" in to "SteamLibrary/steamapps/common/Baldurs Gate 3 Toolkit".</li>
<li>Start the toolkit.</li>
<li>If successful you should see (Dev) at the top of the toolkit window.</li>
</ul><p>The mod folder also contains detailed instructions on how to make changes, including "the exact code changes" you'll need, so you shouldn't struggle too much with using BG3 Toolkit Unlocked.</p>

Well, now you can.</figcaption></figure><p><em>Baldur's Gate 3&nbsp;</em>likely needs no introduction, but just in case, it's a fantasy RPG that serves as the third mainline entry in the long-running&nbsp;<em>Baldur's Gate&nbsp;</em>series.</p>
<p>Developed by&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/divinity-original-sin-ii">Divinity: Original Sin 2</a>&nbsp;</em>studio Larian, this third game takes place over a hundred years after the events of&nbsp;<em>Baldur's Gate 2&nbsp;</em>and follows a group of people attempting to rid themselves of a mind flayer parasite infection.</p>
<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Baldur's Gate 3&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1086940/Baldurs_Gate_3/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/baldurs-gate-3/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/baldurs-gate-3/9ND58LQTG09T" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>.

<p>Fallout is officially an Emmy Award-winning series after securing the award for Outstanding Music Supervision. Out of 16 nominations, including Outstanding Picture Editing and Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series, Fallout secured just one, which some feel isn’t representative of how perfectly pieced together the Amazon series is.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-it-didn-t-set-the-world-on-fire">It Didn’t Set The World on Fire</h2>



<p>Since airing in April 2024, the Fallout TV series has been branded one of the best live-action adaptations ever made, rivalling the likes of The Last of Us. It might seem bizarre that the series only won a single Emmy Award, given how overwhelmingly popular it was and how much of an impact it had on the game series.</p>



<p>The team at Kilter Films and Amazon MGM Studios <a href="https://www.emmys.com/shows/fallout" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">picked up an award</a> for ‘outstanding’ music, with the prize focusing specifically on The End, the opening episode of the post-apocalyptic series.</p>



<p>As one of the best opening episodes of a show in years, ‘The End’ perfectly portrayed the nuclear annihilation that wiped out much of the planet’s population. It showed some of the instant degradation of society in the wake of a world blitzed by atomic power, and it perfectly highlighted some of the black humour and violence present in the Fallout franchise.</p>



<p>And of course, it offered a masterclass in the type of music that fans of the series have come to know and love over the last 25 years.</p>

            <p>Sony has quietly increased the price of a DualSense controller for its PlayStation 5 console.</p>
<p>As spotted by social media account Wario64, the price of various DualSense colour models has increased by $5 in multiple US retailers, but more importantly on Sony's official store PlayStation Direct.</p>
<p>The basic white DualSense controller has increased from $69.99 to $74.99. Over on the <a href="https://direct.playstation.com/en-gb/buy-accessories/dualsense-wireless-controller">UK PlayStation Direct site</a>, the same controller costs £64.99 - up from £59.99 previously.</p>

<p>Other colours are pricier. The Volcanic Red model, for instance, is now £69.99 from £64.99; Sterling Silver is priced the same. The black, pink, and blue models are the same price as the white model.</p>
<p>It's unclear why this price increase has taken effect, though it's not something Sony will officially announce. Could it perhaps be in advance of the rumoured PS5 Pro? Or has the price of manufacture increased?</p>

<p>The change comes shortly after the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ps5-gets-another-price-rise-in-japan-meaning-it-now-costs-170-more-than-at-launch">PS5 received a price hike in Japan</a>, which now costs around £170 more than it did at launch. The DualSense controller and PlayStation VR2 are also more expensive in Japan.</p>
<p>Sony is soon set to celebrate the 30th anniversary of PlayStation, yet its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/leaked-playstation-5-pro-design-seemingly-confirmed-by-sonys-official-30th-anniversary-art">marketing artwork appears to include a PS5 Pro ahead of its announcement</a>, as per leaked images of the console.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/oxenfree-removed-itch-october<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Night School Studio has announced that its horror-inflected narrative adventure&nbsp;<em>Oxenfree&nbsp;</em>will be delisted from a major digital storefront next month, and we're not entirely sure why it's happening.</p>
<p>In an email, Night School says that&nbsp;<em>Oxenfree&nbsp;</em>will no longer be available to download on Itch.io starting from October 1st. This isn't one of those delistings where you can still download the game if you've bought it, either; on October 1st,&nbsp;<em>Oxenfree&nbsp;</em>is gone for good from Itch.io.</p>
<p>Naturally, if you've already downloaded the game files from Itch.io prior to that point, you will still be able to play the game; Itch.io isn't going to hack into your storage drive and delete the game, so don't worry on that front.</p>

<p>Presumably, that means&nbsp;<em>Oxenfree&nbsp;</em>isn't about to be delisted from other platforms on which it's currently available, like <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/388880/Oxenfree/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam</a> or <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/oxenfree" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">GOG</a>, not to mention console storefronts like the <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP0962-CUSA04950_00-OXENBASEENUS0000" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PlayStation Store</a> or the <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/oxenfree-switch/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Nintendo eShop</a>.</p>
<p>I'm assuming that if&nbsp;<em>Oxenfree&nbsp;</em>was about to get delisted elsewhere, Night School would have been a bit more forthcoming about that, but it might just have slipped the studio's mind. You never know!</p>
<p>In any case, we've reached out to Night School for clarification on this issue and will report back as soon as we hear anything.</p>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-a-critical-success-with-critical-failures">Baldur's Gate 3</a>'s latest and much-anticipated seventh patch is here, and we're already making the most of it. As announced by Larian Studios' Swen Vincke, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/modding-is-pretty-big-says-baldurs-gate-3-director-as-over-1m-mods-are-installed-in-less-than-24-hours">"modding is pretty big - we had more than a million mods installed in less than 24 hours</a>".</p>
<p>Fans have taken it even further, though, with one uploading a mod that "unlocks all the disabled features and enables writer permissions for the Baldur's Gate 3 toolkit", which includes level editing, save editing, "and more".</p>

<p>The BG3 Toolkit Unlocked mod - now available over at <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/baldursgate3/mods/12021?tab=stats">NexusMods</a> (thanks, <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/baldurs-gate/it-only-took-two-days-for-someone-to-unlock-a-developer-mode-in-baldur-s-gate-3-s-mod-toolset-opening-up-the-possibility-of-custom-levels-and-campaigns/">PC Gamer</a>) - is especially exciting because it essentially gives Baldur's Gate 3's own community the ability to develop and add whole new areas, quests, and campaigns.</p>
<p>It also gives fans the power to poke around behind the scenes and potentially restore lost or cut content.</p>
<p>This should be particularly exciting for some given mods are big business right now, with the volunteer-made and free-to-play <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fallout-london">Fallout: London</a> becoming the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-london-is-now-the-fastest-redeemed-game-of-all-time-on-gog">"fastest-redeemed" game of all time on GOG</a>. The fan-made mod - which is being distributed for free via GOG's platform, hence why the digital games distributor can't use terms like "fastest-selling" - was redeemed more than 500,000 times in its first 24 hours.</p>

<p>According to Tears of the Kingdom's producer Eiji Aonuma, the team was once thinking about calling the game Tears of the Dragon. However, there was concern this would put too much emphasis on some key plot points within the game.</p>
<p>"Letting it slip that the Light Dragon is Zelda would have been a problem, and this had an effect on the title too. One of the candidates for the title that made it to end was 'Tears of the Dragon'," Aonuma explained in Tears of the Kingdom's newly-released art book (as translated by <a href="https://nintendoeverything.com/zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-almost-called-tears-of-the-dragon/">Nintendo Everything</a>).</p>
<p>"But it would be a bad idea to have the keyword 'Dragon' in the title, and we wanted to have dragon patterns in the logo, but decided otherwise. It'd emphasise the Light Dragon, after all (laughs). But nothing else good was coming to mind, and we were running out of development time..."</p>
<p>Aonuma said the team "went through many words" before landing on Kingdom. "With 'Tears of the Kingdom', it felt like the phrase could connect to the Light Dragon to us, and we could use dragons in the logo," the Zelda producer said, adding: "With the title decided, the logo finally became what it is now."</p>
<p>That logo, which you can see below, shows two dragons in an almost Ouroboros formation. And as those who have played and finished Tears of the Kingdom know, towards the end of the game both <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-destroy-ganondorf-how-beat-demon-king-9343#section-5">Zelda and Ganon make their way above Hyrule in dragon form</a>.</p>

<p>Our Tom has already been hands-on with the upcoming release, noting it "manages to still feel like a proper Zelda game - rather than being a more forgettable princess-led spin-off" in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-reinvents-age-old-gameplay-as-the-series-finally-changes-its-star">Eurogamer's Echoes of Wisdom preview</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/reynatis-preview-shibuya-showdown.975738/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/reynatis-preview-shibuya-showdown<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Reynatis</em> is an action RPG set in Japan, mostly around Shibuya, which is faithfully recreated to stunning detail. Even knowing this, I did a double-take when I found out Burger King was in this game.</p>
<p>Burger King being in <em>Reynatis</em> is completely inconsequential to the plot or gameplay, but I can't get over cool that is. The main thing here is, there's a lot of Shibuya to see in <em>Reynatis</em>, and that's what impressed me most with an otherwise adequate action title.</p>
<p>Developed by <a href="https://techraptor.net/companies/furyu-corporation">Furyu Corporation</a> and published by <a href="https://techraptor.net/companies/nis-america/news">NIS America</a>, <em>Reynatis </em>is coming out later this month, and we had a chance to play it at PAX West 2024. While the aesthetic of Shibuya and <em>Reynatis</em>' characters are appealing to look at, gameplay didn't quite hit the mark.</p>

<h2>Wizards, Shibuya, Oh My! Reynatis' World is Intriguing</h2>
<p>In a world where magic is controlled by an oppressive government, being a wizard is dangerous, especially if you're not a part of the regime. Sorcery and modern times collide in <em>Reynatis</em>, not unlike, say, <em>Jujutsu Kaisen.</em></p>
<p>Something about magic colliding with a high tech, bustling city is super fun as a concept, and <em>Reynatis</em> nails that. Developer Furyu Corporation worked with hundreds of real-life shops in Shibuya in order to create the most authentic feeling city possible.</p>

<p>This creates an immersive environment through which the story takes place. How the city plays a role in <em>Reynatis</em> is still up in the air, but to put so much effort into creating iconic buildings like Shibuya 109 and, well, Burger King, I'm sure players such as myself will greatly appreciate that attention to detail.</p>
<p>And while graphically, it's not the most advanced game I've seen, it has a very appealing aesthetic that balances realistic with anime. It's a lot like <em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/astral-chain-review-awesome-anime-action">Astral Chain</a>,</em> a game with stunning colors and oozing with style, but is limited by the Switch's hardware.</p>

<h2><em>Reynatis</em>' Combat Conundrum</h2>
<p>And like <em>Astral Chain</em>, this is a flashy, game with tons of action thrown into the mix. As a user of Wizarts, you can shift into Liberated mode -- this outfits you with magical weapons and some wicked new attire. Combat takes place in these rifts found across Shibuya -- which seem like some sort of alternate dimension -- and also in the streets themselves.</p>
<p>Rifts comprise linear fights against monsters, and battles are fren, though pretty derivative, amounting to mostly button mashing with a few special abilities thrown into the mix. <em>Reynatis</em> is fun in Liberated mode, if anything because you feel like a powerful badass. It's when you expend all that magical energy, things slow down a bit</p>
<p>Using up your magic in Liberated mode shifts players back into their normal, everyday clothes -- this is called Suppressed mode. You can't attack while Suppressed and have to dodge attacks with a certain precision to restore energy.</p>

<p>Suppressed mode in <em>Reynatis</em> feels a bit like whiplash -- you have this super fast, flashy combat that suddenly shifts into something much slower. Having this handicap hindered my enjoyment overall, and since it's such a pivotal part of the gameplay, I'm not sure if much will change.</p>
<p>There <em>will</em> be multiple party members with various abilities in <em>Reynatis</em>, so I'm hoping things feel a bit better once players get a full party. The demo didn't give a super clear look at how this works, but I was able to play characters with various weapons, from guns to swords.</p>
<p>I'm a bit lukewarm on <em>Reynatis</em>. Sure, the world is beautiful, but the combat didn't satisfy me as much as I'd hoped. The lore, with magic being controlled and illegal street sorcerers evading the law, holds a lot of promise. Hey, if anything, at least <em>Reynatis </em>has Burger King.</p>

            <p>
Monica Harrington isn't one of Valve's official co-founders, but she was heavily involved in its formation and initial success - working by day as a marketing manager at Microsoft with responsibility for the games division, while helping her partner, Mike Harrington, and Gabe Newell get the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/half-life">Half-Life</a> studio off the ground. In a lengthy post on <a href="https://medium.com/@monicah428/the-early-days-of-valve-from-a-woman-inside-bf80c6b47961">Medium</a> - which Nic has already covered in the most recent <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-sunday-papers-734">Sunday Papers</a>, but which I think deserves a piece of its own - Harrington takes us through those heady early days. 
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
Amongst many other things, Harrington discusses how she and her husband poured their own money into Valve, and how she walked the complicated line of drawing upon her Microsoft experience to shape Valve's approach with Half-Life, without developing an actual conflict of interest. When the line became impossible to walk, she resigned from Microsoft, becoming chief marketing officer at Valve from 1996 to 2000.</p>
<p>There are intriguing memories aplenty - how Valve and Sierra fell out over the marketing of Half-Life after release, and how concerns about CD burners led to the implementation of an authentication scheme which accidentally gave Valve a direct line to their first players. Harrington also treats us to a marketing-eye picture of the industry during the 1990s and the balance of clout between developers, publishers, press, pirates and players, drawing comparisons with music and film.
</p>
<p>
There are insights upon the development of Half-Life - how it looked after its first triumphant E3 showing versus how it was shaping up internally - and to a lesser extent, Team Fortress. But I think the most interesting part is Harrington's account of a pitch she made, shortly after Half-Life's release, to set up a digital games store and community platform in partnership with... Amazon. Had that gone all the way, industry history might have been very different. Here's the excerpt in full:
</p>
<blockquote><p>
In a nine-page document, I proposed that Valve and Amazon team up to create a new online entertainment platform. I scaled the business opportunity within four years at $500 million dollars. The gist of the idea was to create a made-for-the-medium platform that would bring users together in a sticky, compelling entertainment experience, with digital and offline content sales. I wanted Amazon's financial backing as a way to gain first mover advantage against Microsoft and Electronic Arts, then the major PC games players. I didn't see a role for Sierra. If pushed, we wouldn't create any new games ourselves, and instead would team with outside developers so that they could distribute content not subject to an 85% publishing fee. At the time, I considered it an act of rebellion against the traditional publishing dynamic where independent developers took on huge risk, and the big publishing houses reaped the rewards. 
</p></blockquote>
<p>
According to Harrington, Amazon offered to buy a minority stake in Valve a few weeks later. You can obviously see the bones of Steam in that proposal, though Harrington appears to have conceived of it mostly to get a valuation for Valve, to help her and her partner when they eventually sold their share of the business to Newell.
</p>
<p>
Sadly, Harrington's motivation for writing the post is partly that she has been left out of Valve's history - including <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/all-of-half-lifes-textures-were-created-by-a-single-person-new-making-of-documentary-explains">Valve's own 2023 Half-Life making-of documentary</a> - despite being so heavily involved with the company during its first few years. Harrington attributes this partly to her consciously stepping back to avoid interfering in her husband's partnership with Gabe Newell, and partly to "bro culture" and sexist practices in the tech biz at large. Here's that part in full:
</p>
<blockquote><p>
As I look back on the huge success Valve has become, I'm proud of what the team accomplished. I'm also proud of the work I did while recognizing that my biggest contributions to Valve's business went largely unnoticed and unrecognized within the industry. Part of that was due to the bro culture of the software business, part of it was that I receded to support my husband in a partnership where he was effectively the lesser partner, and part of it was that women, especially in tech, often seem to disappear when the story gets told.
</p>
<p>
I was hugely disappointed when Valve released a video in 2023 about the creation of Half-Life where one of the people interviewed, Karen Laur, a wonderfully talented texture artist, talked about the isolating experience of being a woman at Valve and essentially said that the only other woman during her tenure there was an office manager. I understood why she felt as she did, but the senior Valve team knows better. Watching the video, I felt like my place in Valve's history had been completely erased.
</p>
<p>
I know that Valve wouldn't have been successful without Mike. It wouldn't have been successful without Gabe. And it wouldn't have been successful without me. A friend of mine who knows the full story once said to me, "you were a founding partner" and in hindsight, I agree. From the beginning, I invested time, treasure and industry expertise to make the company a huge success.
</p>
<p>
And it is.
</p></blockquote>
<p>
Harrington has done a variety of things since leaving Valve in 2000, from getting into whale conservation to a job at the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation. She and Mike Harrington broke up and divorced in 2016. <a href="https://medium.com/@monicah428/the-early-days-of-valve-from-a-woman-inside-bf80c6b47961">The full post is worth a read.</a> As it happens, I've recently been trawling back through <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/topics/the-secret-history-of-rps">the ancient annals of Rock Paper Shotgun</a> and learning about the site's formative early interactions with Valve, while thinking about RPS's future under Ian Games of the Ian Games Network. It's useful to get some perspective on one of today's weather-makers from the other side of the aisle.

Sony’s own storefront for gaming accessories, PlayStation Direct, also shows the base white DualSense going from $70 up to $75, while new color variants and special edition versions like the <em>Concord</em> and <em>Astro Bot</em>-themed controllers have all gotten pricier as well.</p><p>What’s especially odd about the news is that it hasn’t come alongside a broader announcement, nor an explanation at the PlayStation Blog as to why the controllers will be more expensive four years into this console cycle, rather than less. In the past, hardware would get cheaper the older it got, with price cuts to the PS3 and PS4 helping new players finally upgrade. But this time around things are going in the opposite direction.</p><p>A year ago, Sony announced that its revamped PS Plus program, which is required to play games online, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/sony-ps-plus-ps5-game-pass-price-spider-man-2-starfield-1850787462&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/sony-ps-plus-ps5-game-pass-price-spider-man-2-starfield-1850787462">would be going up by as much as $40</a></span> a year at the most expensive tier. A couple months later, it revealed a new “Slim” model for the PS5 that raised the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/sony-playstation-ps5-slim-all-digital-disc-drive-price-1850914803&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/sony-playstation-ps5-slim-all-digital-disc-drive-price-1850914803">price of the all-digital version by $50</a></span>, with an optional disc drive costing $80 to purchase separately. And just last week, Sony announced the PS5 would be getting a massive <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://blog.ja.playstation.com/2024/08/27/20240827-ps5/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://blog.ja.playstation.com/2024/08/27/20240827-ps5/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">price hike of 13,000 yen</a></span>, or roughly $90, in Japan. </p><p>Normally, players who wait to upgrade from one console generation to the next get rewarded with cheaper prices and a bigger library of new games waiting for them. That hasn’t been the case this time around, with many of the PS5's bigger exclusives being cross-gen for longer than expected, and the base PS5 holding steady at $500.</p><p>The DualSense going up $5 looks minor in the scheme of things, but the controllers have also been notorious <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/nacon-ps5-controller-drift-ps4-pc-1851128871&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/nacon-ps5-controller-drift-ps4-pc-1851128871">for stick drift issues</a></span>, and I’ve found myself going through one every couple years just from the rubber nubs rubbing off or pins in the haptic triggers breaking. And because of the proprietary technology, there are no cheap third-party alternatives for the PS5 controller. </p><p>The recent launch of<em> Astro Bot </em>has shown how impressive and immersive the DualSense can making playing a game feel when utilized to the max, but for most games, any old controller would do just fine.&nbsp;</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Another day, another Embracer-owned studios has been hit with layoffs, and this time is Lost Boys Interactive. </p>



<p>On Friday afternoon, the co-developer known for work on games like Tiny Tina’s Wonderlands, Diablo IV, and more announced on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/lost-boys-interactive_friday-september-6th-lost-boys-interactive-activity-7237875363832324096-h6ci/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">LinkedIn</a> that it had “made the very difficult decision to reduce [its] overall headcount”. </p>







<p>In the post, the company says that it’s “directly influenced by the projects and priorities of our development clients.” It was added that a “shifting market” had forced the company to “reassess [its] operations”.</p>



<p>“We recognize the impact of this decision on our team members, who have contributed greatly to our success,” Lost Boys Interactive CEO Shaun Nivens said. “Decisions involving staff reductions are never made lightly, and this action was taken only after considering all other options. We are committed to supporting them in every way we can during this transition.”</p>



<p>This isn’t the first time that Lost Boys Interactive has seen layoffs. Just <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tiny-tinas-wonderlands-developer-lost-boys-interactive-hit-with-layoffs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">earlier this year</a> the company lost around 125 of its 400-person staff. </p>



<p>Currently, there’s no word on the number of people let go in this latest round of layoffs. Once that number is known, however, it will put the gaming industry <a href="http://gaminglayoffs.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">at over 12,000 jobs lost</a> in 2024.  Last year, the industry saw roughly 10,500 people lose their jobs.</p>



<p>Embracer nor Lost Boys Interactive have responded to Insider Gaming’s requests for comment on the reasoning for the layoffs.</p>



<p>The studio says, however, that it is “dedicated to delivering high-quality full development services to our current partners and clients.”</p>

<p>Prototype gameplay of Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare, codenamed Phantoms, has leaked online with 17 minutes of footage.</p>



<p>The new gameplay footage comes from YouTuber Alpha Archive, who has uploaded nearly 17 minutes of gameplay footage to his YouTube channel. The footage is from the single-player mission “Fission” and was codenamed “Fusion” when it was in development. You can watch the gameplay below:</p>



<figure><p>

</p></figure>



<p>Date May 3, 2013; the content is around 18 months away from actual completion as Advanced Warfare was released in November 2014. The prototype uses Modern Warfare 2 and Modern Warfare 3 assets as placeholders. Although there’s not much else to see in terms of new content, just seeing prototype footage from one of the biggest gaming franchises in the world is fascinating. </p>



<p>Call of Duty: Advanced Warfare was released in 2014 by Sledgehammer Games under Glen Schofield, Michael Condrey, and Bret Robbins. It was Sledgehammer Games’ first mainline Call of Duty title, where they received primarily credit following their support of Infinity Ward on Modern Warfare 3. </p>



<p>The game introduced exo-suits into the series for the first time, which allowed players to boost and jump, which was considered a massive leap from the standard formula Call of Duty was known for at the time.</p>



<p>Advanced Warfare was released on the PlayStation 3, PlayStation 4, Xbox 360, Xbox One, and PC. </p>



<p>What do you think of the Advanced Warfare prototype footage? Let us know in the comments below!</p>

		<p>Super Mario Party Jamboree is a bit of a tautological title, but it’s also the perfect way to describe this latest Mario Party game. There’s just more party in it! More maps, more characters, more mini games than in any previous mainline entry. At the third attempt on Switch, it feels like Nintendo Cube (formerly Nd Cube) have finally cottoned on to what series fans have been saying all along: just give us more, and don’t mess with the formula.</p>
<p><iframe title="Super Mario Party Jamboree – Announcement Trailer – Nintendo Switch" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lKp9cD4e8ac?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Of course, you can’t really blame a developer for trying to iterate and add new ideas to such a long-running series, but it’s fair to say that the various experiments in the 2010s just didn’t land. Players moving together in a car, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2018/10/03/super-mario-party-review/">character specific (and smaller) dice</a>, free movement without set paths, they just didn’t scratch the itch that fans of the N64 and GameCube games had. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/10/28/mario-party-superstars-review/">Mario Party Superstars</a> was, in many ways, the answer to this – “You want old stuff? Have some old stuff!” – remaking classic boards, bringing back 10-side dice, and remaking a bunch of classic minigames.</p>


<p>Now Super Mario Party Jamboree is carrying that on. It is essentially the same gameplay as before, but with new boards, new minigames, both button and motion controls, and some new twists on online multiplayer as well.</p>
<p>There’s also more characters than ever. A total of 22 playable characters are available to choose from, with a whole host of Bowser’s minions filling out the usual roster, as well as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QgNfiHcQqHk">Pauline and Ninji</a>, who are completely new for the series.</p>


<p>There’s five new boards and two remakes in Super Mario Party Jamboree, and we went hands-on with Mega Wiggler’s Tree Party. As is typical, players roll a die and move between 1 and 10 spaces on their turn, visiting stores, triggering events, and choosing the path to travel down as you race to reach a star on the map. After all the players have had a go, it cuts to a minigame, which is the main place to earn coins to afford those stars and items –&nbsp;again, items are fairly standard, with the main wrinkle we spotted being that there’s now two types of warp pipe: a green random one and a gold ‘move to Star’ one.</p>
<p>For Mega Wiggler’s Tree Party, there’s three main routes –&nbsp;a small loop, a main loop and then an extended branch off that –&nbsp;as well as the option to take a path along Wiggler’s back as a shortcut. The risk there is that other players can land on event spaces that see Wiggler move and completely throw you off course.</p>
<p>It’s a fairly straightforward board, but there’s still things like piranha plants that will snap at you and steal more money for each player they catch, and a game of chance where you try to extract honey from honeycombs, and hope you don’t trigger the bees.</p>

<p>The 110 minigames in Super Mario Party Jamboree will cover all bases with both button controls and motion controls represented, and a mix of free-for-all and team-based modes. There’s some great ones, like teams trying to cut steaks perfectly in half, and revisited ideas, like a player hiding in one of four slots while the others try to find them…. with hammers. The 3v1 minigames are always difficult to balance, and it’s fair to say that some still stack the odds way in the favour of the solo player, or the party of three. Still, it wouldn’t be Mario Party if there wasn’t some arbitrary nonsense!</p>
<p>If you just want a quick dose of Mario Party shenanigans without having to sink at least an hour into playing a full board, then there’s plenty of ways to get straight at the minigames, such as with the Daily Challenge. This offers up themed collections of three minigames to quickly race through, such as Minigame Munchies featuring cookie cutting and avoiding gigantic sandwiches as they fall from the sky, with players earning stars for each round they win.</p>

<p>These days you need to have online multiplayer, though, and thankfully Super Mario Party Jamboree builds on the options featured in the last two games. You can play a full board in online multiplayer, which is always welcome, but there’s snappier online modes alongside this.</p>
<p>The Koopathlon sends up two 20 players into a race of minigames, with each coin that you earn during a round sending you running around the track. Every few rounds, you’re then confronted with a showdown against Bowser as you try to avoid or outpace hazards he sends your way –&nbsp;like hopping over fireballs shot from the side of the screen –&nbsp;and with a penalty that will send you back a certain number of spaces depending on if and how long you survive for. The first player to complete five laps wins, which will keep you occupied for a good long while!</p>
<p>Then there’s the cooperative Bowser Kaboom Squad mode for up to eight players. There’s an imposter Kaiju-sized Bowser stomping around, with some other minions like Charging Chucks alongside for good measure, and you have to take him down. How do you do that? Well, crates of bombs are dropping from the sky and you need to go grab them and load up a cannon to deal damage, all while time ticks down for a coop minigame round, and the chance to earn some bonus items. You have to defeat Bowser within 5 rounds, which could be easier said than done!</p>

<p>For one thing, the coop minigames can be pretty tricky, like trying to collectively walk on in time to outpace a Wiggler, and Bowser’s stomping can knock people out so they need to be recovered from bubbles. Running around the stage is simple enough, but the camera controls are minimal if playing with a single Joy-Con, as all you can do is turn the camera to face the cannon, which can leave large parts of the map and incoming danger out of sight. It’s still good and frantic fun, though.</p>
<p>Like a second serving of a tasty jambalaya, Super Mario Party Jamboree is more of the same, but in all the right ways. There’s still some experimentation with the online multiplayer modes, but the core board game experience is being kept intact, and there’s that extra 10% on top.</p>

<p>When we checked out <em>Popucom </em>at PAX West 2024, it was a surprise, to say the least. I came in with little knowledge on the title besides its cooperative <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/astro-bot-review-90s-platformer-done-right">platformer</a>, color-matching premise, but I left wanting to learn (and play) much more. With <em>Popucom, </em>fun is guaranteed.</p>

<h2><em>Popucom </em>- Part Matching Game, Part Platformer</h2>
<p><em>Popucom</em> has a delightfully simple concept executed so wonderfully. Take elements from color-matching games like <em>Zuma's Revenge</em>, a dash of <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/splatoon"><em>Splatoon</em></a>, and make it co-op. It's a game that requires a minimum of two players with a maximum of four, so friends are mandatory, but that just makes it even more fun.</p>
<p>I played my <em>Popucom</em> demo with a developer, and across several levels I was able to grasp the basics of this game's premise. Playing two-player co-op gives you the ability to shoot two different colors -- so I was assigned blue and green. A simple button press shifts your color instantaneously. My partner had two other, different colors.</p>

<p>As a platformer, you'll traverse stages with plenty of obstacles, and those obstacles also have assigned colors. At one point, my companion and I are on a moving platform and barriers block the way; each barrier is colored differently, so we have to alternate shooting these blockades with the correct color so we don't fall off.</p>
<p>This is just a very simple objective, but as one can imagine, <em>Popucom</em>'s gameplay can (and will) range in complexity. One level had us use a shield ability, which blocked beams of a certain color. In blocking these, your friend doesn't get zapped by the beams and we can proceed through the stage. You're also able to raise the shield like a platform, to the uses of these tools are multifaceted.</p>

<h2>Blast Enemies Away in <em>Popucom</em></h2>
<p>There's also combat in <em>Popucom</em>, and you'll fight blob-like enemies comprising different colors. Some enemies are singular blobs, and so you'll shoot them twice to add another blob on top of it a la <em>Zuma's Revenge </em>(or any other color-matching type game), which defeats them. It becomes a bit more complex when you fight enemies composed of multiple blobs and all four colors.</p>
<p>These cartoonish monstrosity's require a bit more precision with your shots and fall apart piece by piece in such a cool way. Of course, if you miss and shoot the wrong color at the wrong blob, the enemy grows bigger. This can be a bit tricky for someone who is colorblind such as myself, but I'm told there will be accessibility options for this on launch.</p>
<p>The final part of my <em>Popucom</em> demo had me fight against a gigantic snake. Its long body is made of these colored orbs-- so of course, we shoot the corresponding color at them -- but things get a bit more tricky when the boss shot out colored obstacles that needed to be nullified with a shot.</p>

<p>Eventually, we hop on this roller coaster and follow the snake through the crowds as it shoots projectiles at us -- which, you guessed it, we need to shoot -- and eventually we whittle away the boss's body and defeat it.</p>
<p>I find it's a bit difficult for me to find the words to describe <em>Popucom</em>'s gameplay, which is strange for such a simple concept. Rest assured, it's one of those games that once you see it, you'll understand immediately. <em>Popucom</em> concocted a formula for the perfect cooperative experience, and I can't wait for more.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/super-mario-party-jamboree-preview-you-should-be-excited-for-mario-party.975675/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/super-mario-party-jamboree-preview-you-should-be-excited-for-mario-party<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>With just how formulaic and rigid <em>Mario Party</em> is, I wouldn’t blame you for feeling a bit along the lines of “played one, played them all.” I think <em>Super Mario Party Jamboree </em>is going to change some minds, however.</p>
<p>While at PAX West, I got a little over an hour with the game and got to play a few of the games modes, including checking out the classic Party mode of collecting stars around the boardgame.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As for that classic mode, that’s where <em>Super Mario Party Jamboree </em>will certainly feel the most familiar. We spent the least amount of time on it, and it’s going to be pretty much what you think it is.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Obviously, a lot of the mileage for<em> Mario Party</em> is just how much you enjoy the various minigames, of which I did have a good time. They’re bite-sized, and I did find myself enjoying quite a few more than I thought.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In one, you and a partner must align to cut a large piece of steak in half. The catch is, many of them aren’t symmetrical, so you have to make as good a guess as you can.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I’m not sure why, but seeing a high definition, very real looking giant slab of perfectly cooked steak next to a Boo and a Goomba is very funny.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Super Mario Party Jamboree’s Online Modes Are Very Fun&nbsp;</h2>
<p>The most unique, and new, parts of <em>Jamboree </em>were in two new online modes we got to check out. They both mix up the<em> Mario Party </em>formula enough to make even minigames you’ve played before feel fresh.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The first we tried was Koopathlon. In Koopathlon, you and 20 people compete by completing the same minigames, seeing who can do the best in them. It’s a bit of a race in that you’re completing laps around a huge track, which is something like 100 spaces long. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Each minigame you move forward, or back, a certain number of spaces depending on how well you do (or coins you collect). There’s even a leaderboard that looks near identical to Mario Kart.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Koopathlon is not simply just playing some minigames and seeing who does the best, either, as there are some quirks.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As the Koopathlon takes place over multiple rounds, you’ll actually play the same three minigames each round. However, each round that same minigame gets more difficult.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In one, I had to shoot myself out of various cannons to collect coins in the area. The further the Koopathlon went along, the more complex the coin patterns, cannon movements, and obstacles in my way.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The other minigame I have to shoutout just has you push objects into a chute. Toys and stuffed animals stacked up to then just be poked over an edge and fall over. Genuinely the most satisfying gameplay from my weekend at PAX West.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The minigames have items you can get, a la <em>Mario Kart</em>, that let you get in the way of your of one of your opponents, too. Things like inking your opponent’s screen so they can’t see.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The ramp ups in the minigame difficulty were great, as some minigames definitely have a unique enough concept to see it used in more than just the one way. It was like playing a few games at once, competing against a bunch of people level by level.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The other quirk is that at the end of each round is a Bowser-themed minigame that you have to try to survive or you’ll be sent back spaces in the race. The higher your ranking, the more you lose.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Often, these are hard to survive, and only two of the twenty, usually some CPU characters, survived. &nbsp;</p>
<p>In one, you’re trying to keep ahead of Bowser who keeps destroying a platform as you run towards a screen. In another, you had to avoid standing on the wrong tile before it disappeared or be dropped to your doom.&nbsp;</p>
<p>These can be a good equalizer and avenue for you to mount a comeback if you’re behind. The punishments to those in the top rankings aren’t so devastating they almost guarantee you’ll be behind, like a blue shell, but they make catching up more achievable for those behind.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Kaboom Squad is Cooperative Mario Party&nbsp;</h2>
<p>The other online mode is for up to 8 people. It sees you pitted against a "Imposter Bowser" in an attempt to defeat him. &nbsp;</p>
<p>The main part of the mode has you running around a map avoiding the giant while attempting to collect bombs to put in a cannon. Once you collect enough, they’re fired off to damage Bowser.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Once the round ends, a cooperative minigame involving the 8 players begins.</p>

<p>An example of one in ours is that one half of the team was collecting apples to make juice while the other half collected the packages to load up a delivery truck. It’s simple on the surface, but there is definitely efficient and proper ways to do it to have the best results.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Depending on how well your team does, you’ll get the opportunity to select some items to help against Bowser. One allows you to place pads that increase your run speed on the map, another increases the amount of bombs you carry, and so on down the line.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The more damage down to Bowser, the more difficult the rounds you’re trying to avoid him and collect bombs become. It’s a nice ramp-up of challenge that gets genuinely difficult and will be impossible without teamwork.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Kaboom Squad is great cooperative fun done well. The 8 player minigames are thoughtful, and you'll never find yourself sitting around waiting for something to do.</p>

<p>As with all things <em>Mario Party</em>, my only big concern comes with the staying power of the game. The regular party mode, with its betrayals and chaos with friends, always has a certain allure no matter what.&nbsp;</p>
<p>However, These two new modes, Koopathlon and Kaboom Squad, rely pretty heavily on the minigames and will be as enjoyable as you find those to be. Will there be enough variety to keep people interested? We don’t quite know yet.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then there’s the pesky issue of Nintendo Online. It’s come a long way, so hopefully this has a good implementation. Thankfully, in the case of at least Koopathlon, the minigames are played solo but just the results are shared. So, that shouldn’t run into some issues.</p>
<h2>Super Mario Party Jamboree Preview | Final Thoughts&nbsp;</h2>
<p>I walked away enjoying <em>Super Mario Party Jamboree</em> a lot more than I thought. The minigames were quirky and fun, the new modes a refreshing way to take in the minigames, and its as charming as you’d expect any Mario game to be. &nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Super Mario Party Jamboree</em> is the first time I’ve been excited for a <em>Mario Party</em> game in a very long time.&nbsp;</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ex-capcom-staffers-birdkin-hideaki-saori-utsumi<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Ex-Capcom staffers and sound designers Hideaki and Saori Utsumi have announced Birdkin Studio, a new two-person husband-and-wife indie outfit based in their native Japan.</p>
<p>Per the <a href="http://www.birdkin.com/Welcome.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">studio's new official website</a>&nbsp;(which is charmingly simple), the studio is a small one; "just Hideaki Utsumi and Saori Utsumi", as the description goes. They're currently working on their debut title, which will be released for Switch and PC via Steam.</p>
<p>No details about the game are available just yet (apart from one piece of artwork which may or may not be indicative of the final product), but if you want to keep up with Birdkin's progress, you can do so via the <a href="https://x.com/birdkinstudio" rel="noopener" target="_blank">studio's official X (formerly Twitter) account</a>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/resident-evil-hideaki-saori-utsumi-birdkin.jpg?itok=rfv8TNMN 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/resident-evil-hideaki-saori-utsumi-birdkin.jpg?itok=Wxqscmz_ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Hideaki and Saori Utsumi's credits include franchises like&nbsp;<em>Resident Evil</em>,&nbsp;<em>Devil May Cry</em>, and more.</figcaption></figure><p>According to the site, Hideaki Utsumi will serve as a game designer, sound designer, and composer for Birdkin, all of which are also roles Saori will take on. In addition, she'll be a CG artist and programmer for the studio.</p>
<p>If you feel that Utsumi's name is familiar, then you may have seen some videos of the couple's adorable birds, of which they have four: Gumi, Kiwi, Kohaku, and Lemon.</p>
<p>Utsumi's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCsS33cJqqykG3bM7gGDEulg" rel="noopener" target="_blank">YouTube channel</a>&nbsp;is chock-full of videos of the birds and the chaos they create. In particular, Gumi, a red and green chattering lory, is well-known for his distinctive "wuewuewue" catchphrase. If you haven't seen it, I heartily recommend checking it out for a big lift to your day.</p>
<p>Saori also has two YouTube channels: one for <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXkxH0sZml2Jy7vmXayAWuw" rel="noopener" target="_blank">her music</a> and one on which she posts <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCzC-DBjubG__KmShLv1EULA" rel="noopener" target="_blank">videos of the couple's birds</a>. The videos are mostly in Japanese, but they're well worth a watch to get a sense of what she's about.</p>

<p>The Utsumis aren't the first ex-Capcom staffers to fly the nest, so to speak (although neither of them has worked at Capcom for quite some time).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Others include&nbsp;<em>Resident Evil&nbsp;</em>producer Hiroyuki Kobayashi, who <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ex-capcom-producer-founds-new-studio-at-netease">founded his own NetEase-funded studio in 2022</a>, and Hideaki Itsuno, who <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/famed-dragons-dogma-and-devil-may-cry-director-hideaki-itsuno-leaves-capcom-after-30-years" rel="noopener" target="_blank">left Capcom recently</a> after over 30 years with the company.</p>
<p>We'll bring you more on what the Utsumis get up to next as soon as we've got it. Stay tuned!</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/abiotic-factor-devs-promise-fix-for-connectivity-issues.975669/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/abiotic-factor-connectivity-dev-pledge-fix<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Abiotic Factor&nbsp;</em>developer Deep Field Games has acknowledged one of the game's major ongoing connection issues and has pledged to release a fix in time for the next major Community Update.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://x.com/ABFGame/status/1832997878647963853" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a post</a> on the official&nbsp;<em>Abiotic Factor&nbsp;</em>X (formerly Twitter) account, Deep Field provides some steps to try out if you're experiencing the "Fleming" error - or, indeed, any other error - when trying to join a friend's&nbsp;<em>Abiotic Factor&nbsp;</em>game.</p>
<p>The steps are pretty simple; either get the host and clients to restart <em>Abiotic Factor</em>, or have the host player restart their entire PC. It doesn't seem like client players need to take this step, however.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/abiotic-factor-connectivity-issues-machine.jpg?itok=ky49rsx7 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/abiotic-factor-connectivity-issues-machine.jpg?itok=8EnFjoDB 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>If you're having connectivity issues in&nbsp;<em>Abiotic Factor</em>, rest assured Deep Field is aware of the problem.</figcaption></figure><p>Deep Field says that if neither of these fixes work for you, then a "long-term fix" is also in the works, and it should be implemented by the time Community Update 2 rolls around.</p>
<p>We don't know quite when that will be just yet, but as a reminder, Community Update 1 <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/abiotic-factor-update-dynamic-difficulty-more">launched back in May</a>, just three weeks after&nbsp;<em>Abiotic Factor&nbsp;</em>itself was released. It added features like difficulty tweaks, save backups, and more.</p>
<p>Recently, however, Deep Field did provide a first look at what's coming when Community Update 2 does arrive, and it'll bring features like difficulty options during world creation, new aquarium items, and more storage options.</p>
<p>Community Updates are not seemingly on the same level as major content drops like <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/427410/view/4340992597637826894" rel="noopener" target="_blank">August's Crush Depth update</a>, but that makes them the perfect home for fixes like the one in the works for the aforementioned connectivity problem.</p>

<p>If you're wondering exactly what&nbsp;<em>Abiotic Factor&nbsp;</em>is, it's a survival-crafter set in an underground research station overrun with paranormal horrors.</p>
<p>You (and, optionally, up to five of your friends) must build a base from which to sally forth, gather resources, and investigate what's happening to the station. Just try not to die along the way!</p>
<p>Deep Field's game has proven pretty popular indeed; less than two weeks out from launch, it <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/abiotic-factor-sales-250k">hit 250,000 sales</a>, reaching the 600,000 mark <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/abiotic-factor-sales-600k">just a couple of months later</a>.</p>
<p><em>Abiotic Factor&nbsp;</em>is available right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/427410/Abiotic_Factor/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC via Steam Early Access</a>. Stay tuned for more on this one.</p>

Way to protect your legacy! <a href="https://t.co/LRGsPYSX9g" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://t.co/LRGsPYSX9g</a></p>— John Garvin (@John_Garvin) <a href="https://twitter.com/John_Garvin/status/1832243904172978646?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">September 7, 2024</a></blockquote> <p>Then, responding to the backlash to his tweet, <a href="https://x.com/John_Garvin/status/1832253308570104117" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Garvin doubled down</a>: “Haha. I see my character reduced to a cartoon schill promoting some small game and I’m being harsh? Sit down, my brotha, adults are talking.”</p><p>Garvin’s tweets were roundly criticized (one current PlayStation Studios developer responded to call Astro Bot “a love letter to Playstation games. Not exactly sure what you're getting all hot and bothered about. Very happy to see games I've worked on referenced in this way”). But they are also unsurprising, given his previous comments on Sony’s treatment of Days Gone and the sequel that never happened. In December 2022, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bend-studio-distances-itself-from-former-director-after-twitter-rant-about-critical-reception">Bend Studio addressed an outburst from its former employee</a>, who had blamed “woke reviewers” for Days Gone’s critical reception.</p><p>“We are aware of the comments made by our previous creative director on Days Gone regarding his personal view on the critical reception of our intellectual property,” Bend said at the time. “Bend Studio does not share his sentiment, nor does it reflect the views of our team.” It seems unlikely Sony or Bend Studio will respond to Garvin’s latest outburst.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>All 173 PlayStation Characters in Astro Bot - Easter Eggs</h3></div></output><p>Garvin, by his own admission, <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/days-gone-lead-says-dont-complain-if-theres-no-sequel-if-you-didnt-buy-it-full-price/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>was fired from Bend Studio for being “a disruptive personality”</u></a>. In a <a href="https://youtu.be/yjUrrDPL-Gs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>talk with fellow former Sony developer David Jaffe</u></a>, Garvin said he “had a few heated arguments” at the studio, and that he “sucked” at being a people person, a skill required in his position at the helm of a large team.</p><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/astro-bot-review">In our 9/10 review of Astro Bo</a><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/astro-bot-review">t</a>, IGN said: “A fantastically inventive platformer in its own right, Astro Bot is particularly special for anyone with a place in their heart for PlayStation.”</p><p>Our Days Gone review, meanwhile, returned a 6/10. “Fun in small bursts, but Days Gone's repetition, bland world, and meandering story make for an unremarkable ride," we said.”</p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

"For me, that is a mistake, and this is something that we're going to work on improving," he said.</p><p>"I don't think it means removing the fail state completely, but I do think there are millions of low hanging fruits where we can make it so much more enjoyable and understandable."</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Star Wars Outlaws Review Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>Gerighty continued: "I think it feels unfair. And believe it or not, this wasn't our intention. This is more of something that crept in in the last week or so, and that we're correcting already for a patch that's coming out maybe in 10 days."</p><p>Gerighty made this comment on September 7, 2024, so the 10 day mark would see the patch released next Tuesday, on September 17.</p><p>This is presumably just one way Gerighty plans on improving Star Wars Outlaws, as the creative director has already said <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/star-wars-outlaws-director-a-little-disappointed-by-its-review-scores-but-vows-to-improve-the-game">he's a "little disappointed" by its review scores</a> and therefore wants to improve it for a long time to come.</p><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/star-wars-outlaws-review">In our 7/10 review of the game</a>, IGN said: "Star Wars Outlaws is a fun intergalactic heist adventure with great exploration, but it’s hindered by simple stealth, repetitive combat, and a few too many bugs at launch."</p><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-shares-take-a-hit-as-analysts-predict-lower-than-expected-star-wars-outlaws-sales">Ubisoft shares fell in value following the release of Star Wars Outlaws</a>, with some analysts predicting lower-than-expectated sales of the game. Ubisoft has yet to comment on its performance.</p><p><em>Ryan Dinsdale is an IGN freelance reporter. He'll talk about The Witcher all day.</em></p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>
