              <p><em>Mortal Kombat 2</em> <a href="https://kotaku.com/mortal-kombat-2-karl-urban-johnny-cage-first-trailer-1851786495">was set to hit theaters</a> on October 24, just a week before Halloween. It seemed like good timing for a hyper-violent video game classic about warriors fighting horrors from other dimensions. Apparently Warner Bros. disagreed. The studio has now delayed the sequel by nearly seven months because it thinks the corny fist-fest can make more money in the spring.</p> <p>That’s according <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/08/mortal-kombat-ii-opening-date-1236501771/">to Deadline</a>, which reported the news late on Friday before the Labor Day holiday weekend. It claims “research screenings have been strong” and that Warner Bros. didn’t want to bury its latest video game adaptation in a “crowded late October frame” between<em> Springsteen Deliver Me From Nowhere</em> and <em>Regretting You</em>.</p> <p>So instead, <em>Mortal Kombat 2</em> will now come out on May 15, 2026.<em> Avengers: Doomsday</em> was originally set to open that month but was pushed back to December of next year. The only real competition will be <i>The Mandalorian and Grogu</i> which arrives at the end of next May. So even if <em>Mortal Kombat 2</em> ends up having a surprisingly long tail, it’ll probably get kicked out of most theaters by<em> Star Wars</em>.</p> <p>The sequel brings in<em> The Boys</em>‘ Karl Urban as the shade-wearing, split-kicking Johnny Cage and its July trailer looked decent. If it has the budget to double-down on some of the big spectacle fight sequences the 2021 reboot was missing it could be fun. Though I still think its cheesy gore-fest sensibility was a great fit for Halloween. I don’t usually like slasher movies but I’ll make an exception if Scorpion’s the one doing the impaling.</p>

<p>Gameplay footage of Battlefield 6’s Operation Firestorm map has leaked online from the game’s recent playtests.</p>



<p>Battlefield began its <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-labs-testing-is-back/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battlefield Labs playtests again this week</a>, following its hugely successful <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-open-beta-record-stats/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battlefield 6 Beta</a>. As expected, the leaks are coming thick and fast. The most recent leak is of Operation Firestorm, a map that was first featured in Battlefield 3.</p>



<p>You can watch some of the gameplay footage below:</p>

<p>Operation Firestorm is currently the only named remade map to be featured in Battlefield 6, but other maps, including the highly popular Operation Metro, are most certainly going to make a return during the game’s life cycle.</p>

<p>Other leaks from the Battlefield Labs playtests are also coming in thick and fast, including the addition of the server browser in Battlefield Portal. As of the time of writing, the developers have only committed to bringing the server browser to Portal and will leave standard multiplayer for standard matchmaking. </p>

            <title><![CDATA[Hands-On With Silksong: More Questions Than Answers]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/silksong-demo-hands-on-price-hollow-knight-pax-west-2000621695</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/hands-on-with-silksong-more-questions-than-answers.1284819/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em> has a lot in common with <em>Grand Theft Auto 6.</em> Fans have been waiting on it for years. Each new crumb of information is quickly devoured. Competitors are <a href="https://kotaku.com/every-game-delayed-silksong-hollowknight-demonschool-baby-steps-cloverpit-2000620407">scrambling out of the way</a>. And after years of fermenting hype, the most wishlisted game on Steam now has to deliver something bigger than the all consuming cultural distortion field surrounding it. No small task. I’ve now played 15 minutes of the final demo and I still could not tell you which way it’s going to go. That’s because everything that can make a Metroidvania Soulslike like <em>Silksong</em> truly pop is precisely what Team Cherry is keeping most under wraps.</p> <p>I played the Gamescom 2025 build of <em>Silksong</em> on the Xbox Ally PC gaming handheld during a PAX West-adjacent event at Microsoft and it felt like eating a Dunkin Donuts Munchkin: easy, sweet, and over way too soon. That’s by design. Team Cherry <a href="https://kotaku.com/silksong-interview-delay-hollow-knight-team-cherry-2000619168">said in a recent interview</a> that the game took seven years to make because of all of the new areas, characters, and secrets it wanted to pack into the <em>Hollow Knight</em> sequel. And it also clearly didn’t want to ruin any of those things by actually talking about them before the game’s September 4 release date on PC and console, or by showing them off ahead of time in demo.</p> <p>The only portion of<em> Silksong</em> that anyone has played so far takes place near the beginning of the game. Hornet, the new protagonist, awakes in an underground glen full of bright moss and easy enemies. A short platforming section introduces players to the familiar <em>Bloodborne</em>-inspired combat (you need to deal damage to get health back) and the game’s exploration which has you exhausting dead-ends until you find the path forward. It wraps with a simple mini-boss fight that’s intent on scaring any newcomers away.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000621699" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000621699"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000621699">Team Cherry</figcaption></figure> <p>The second section takes you to smoldering caverns with more deadly enemies to navigate. Ensembles of flying, fire-ball spitting wizards and knights with big shields make you work to survive and gesture toward the ambient, elevated threat-level that fills each path you choose to go down with just the right amount of tension.</p> <p>This is all classic <em>Hollow Knight</em> so far. The only thing that really sets<em> Silksong</em> apart in the demo is Hornet. The character’s a bit faster, has a down diagonal attack to speed up aerial recoveries, and can heal more quickly but only after more energy is gathered from dealing damage. It’s a different, more aggressive flow than the original game which could take on an even more distinct identity once players start unlocking their full arsenals.</p>

 <h2>Will <em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em> really cost $20?</h2> <p>All of which is to say that while there were certainly no red flags in my brief hands-on time with <em>Silksong</em>, it’s impossible to know from the 15-minute demo whether Silksong can deliver on what fans have been hoping for over the last eight years. It’s slick and prettier than the original, but what will ultimately matter is the cleverness of its secrets, exploration, and later-game boss fights. One other bit of potential good news ahead of the game’s launch next week is that it might not be very expensive either.</p> <p><em>Hollow Knight</em> launched for just $15 back in 2017. You can currently buy it on PC for just half that price leading up to the sequel’s release (act now and you&nbsp;<em>might</em> be able to beat it in time). <a href="https://www.gamestop.com/video-games/nintendo-switch/products/hollow-knight-silksong---nintendo-switch/432032.html">A leak yesterday</a> on the GameStop website suggested <em>Silksong</em> will be $20, only $5 more than its predecessor at a time when Team Cherry easily could have charged $30 or more. The store listing has since been taken down and might have just been a speculative placeholder.</p> <p>All eyes will be on Steam for when the actual price drops. So far Team Cherry hasn’t actually confirmed how much it will cost. Like almost everything else about the game, the small indie team is keeping that close to the vest. Not that it will matter. Just like the <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jasonschreier.bsky.social/post/3lwwfrbrtwc2x">lack of reviews ahead of launch</a>, <em>Silksong</em> doesn’t have to play by conventional rules. It’s in a league of its own. In less than a week we’ll finally know if it truly belongs there.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-blood-of-dawnwalker-interview-killing-time-and-major-npcs-in-ex-cdpr-devs-new-rpg.1284792/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">If you’ve played more than a few role-playing games, you’ll know how your hero's journey typically plays out. In the prologue, a terrible thing will happen – an event that demands you move quickly to prevent an apocalypse or defeat an all-encompassing evil. In the following hours, you’ll spend 90% of your time completely ignoring that impending threat, instead helping randomers you met in the pub and collecting loot from dungeons. That’s okay, though, because the big bad will always wait for you. The world perpetually teeters on the brink of extinction until you’re ready to fix it. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Not so in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-blood-of-dawnwalker">The Blood of Dawnwalker</a>, the first RPG from Rebel Wolves, a new studio founded by former CD Projekt Red staff. Its campaign puts you on a clock: you have 30 days and 30 nights to save your family from evil vampires. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">That hold-on-while-I-do-a-thousand-side-quests meme “was definitely one of the reasons” for this interesting approach, creative director Mateusz Tomaszkiewicz says with a smile. “I wouldn't say it was the sole reason, but I would say this was definitely a starting point for a conversation.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">To properly understand that time pressure system, it’s best to start with how The Blood of Dawnwalker’s campaign is structured. Dubbed a “narrative sandbox,” it doesn’t follow a linear sequence of events. There’s no quest one, quest two, quest three and so on.  </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“After the prologue, you can go directly to the castle. You could try to rescue your family immediately,” explains Tomaszkiewicz. “There's a variety of quests you can participate in. You can ignore them, or you can do them. There are a lot of activities that are directly targeted against [main villain] Brencis that will weaken him, for example, and make the attack easier. But at any point you can decide, ‘Okay, I've got enough, I'm going to the castle, I'm going to do it.’” </p><p data-cy="paragraph">If The Blood of Dawnwalker was a book, then, you’d read the first chapter and then would be free to skip directly to the end. As for the optional chapters between those two points, you can read them in any order… but you’ll need to find the pages first. “You are not railroaded into these plotlines,” Tomaszkiewicz reveals. “You have to find them [in the world] on your own. We do leave breadcrumbs of course, but we want to make sure that it doesn't feel like ‘These are the three plotlines, do them and then go there,’ right? We wanted to enhance the feeling of exploration and finding these stories in the world.” </p><p data-cy="paragraph">That brings us back to the time system. You have 30 days and 30 nights to explore Vale Sangora, a 14th-century kingdom nestled in the Carpathian Mountains, and undertake as many (or as few) of those plotlines as you want. That time element evolved out of Dawnwalker’s protagonist, Coen. A man suffering from both silver poisoning <em>and</em> a vampiric curse, he lives as a mortal during the day and becomes a blood-sucker at night. “The time passage was kind of central to the character,” Tomaszkiewicz notes, especially since your vampiric abilities allow for a very different, more supernatural playstyle after dark. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The Blood of Dawnwalker - Gamescom 2025 Screenshots</h3></div></output><h2 data-cy="title2">A Clock That Never Ticks</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Perhaps the most important thing to know is that there is no real-time ticking clock in The Blood of Dawnwalker. The minutes do not start counting down from the moment you start a new game. This is not Majora’s Mask or Outer Wilds. “We were thinking that if time would flow naturally, it might be quite unpleasant. The playstyle would change on the go [from human to vampire and back to human] constantly without your input,” explains Tomaszkiewicz. “So that's where the time as a resource idea came in.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s best to think of time in The Blood of Dawnwalker as a currency rather than a stopwatch. A bar, split into eight sections and displayed in the upper-right of the screen, represents your daily allowance of that currency. Performing significant actions marked with an hourglass icon, such as completing objectives or engaging in certain conversations, will “spend” a section of the bar. Similar to Deathloop, then, simply exploring or completing lower-level tasks will not progress time. Theoretically, you could stay in the noon period of the seventh day for dozens of in-game hours, provided you don’t do anything marked with that hourglass symbol.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While Rebel Wolves is very excited about the way time has shaped The Blood of Dawnwalker’s choices and quest design (of which you can learn more about in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-blood-of-dawnwalker-offers-2-very-different-rpg-playstyles">our recent preview</a>), Tomaszkiewicz is aware that many people will be skeptical of the system. “I know there are a lot of players that are afraid of missing out, so we definitely tried to not cut off too much content,” he explains. “We are aiming, at least in a normal, average playthrough, for you to be able to do 80% of the content.” </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>You may have a time limit to save your family, but there is no time limit to complete the game.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Rebel Wolves has twisted temporal rules to deliver on that goal, particularly when it comes to how time-sensitive events are handled. For example, one storyline involves a burning house, but the flames will blaze indefinitely until you actually discover the building. Only then will you need to act before you spend too many sections of the time bar. There’s no chance of you turning up one day to find a house you never knew even existed is now a pile of rubble and ash. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Of course, regardless of how quests and time are handled, there’s always that looming pressure: 30 days and 30 nights to save your family. But there’s unwritten nuance in that deadline. “Don't think about it as a game over thing,” Tomaszkiewicz hints. “It's more like a choice and consequence thing.” </p><p data-cy="paragraph">That’s the vital takeaway: you may have a time limit to save your family, but there is <em>no time limit to complete the game. </em>You can continue to play indefinitely after that point. And who is to say that saving your family will even be the most important part of your story? The Blood of Dawnwalker’s Steam page states: “Embark on the quest to save your family, or swear revenge on your sire and destroy everyone standing in your way.” Perhaps that tale of revenge will provide an alternate journey for the main campaign? I ask Tomaszkiewicz to elaborate, but he refuses. That Steam description is already more than enough, he says. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h2 data-cy="title2">Control Your Dark Urge</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s easy to see time, even when it only moves during specific actions, like sand slipping through your fingers. As something you lose. But it’s important to remember that progressing time brings you closer to one of The Blood of Dawnwalker’s most exciting features: Coen becomes a vampire at night. When the moon rises, you unlock the ability to walk up walls and along ceilings, and to teleport to rooftops and out-of-reach balconies. Such skills unlock a variety of opportunities, not to mention a stealthier play style. And so, if you want, you can skip the days and play only during the night. It’s a “totally viable way to play,” Tomaszkiewicz confirms, albeit with a warning that ignoring the day also means missing quests only available during the waking hours.   </p><p data-cy="paragraph">A vampire’s supernatural strength and skills come at a price, though, and it’s one we all know: gulping down vast quantities of blood. You’ll need to satisfy Coen’s hunger regularly, and the only truly gratifying meal is found in the neck of a human. You can opt to ignore that hunger, or feast on much less-satiating animals, but there are consequences to such a lifestyle. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“If you starve Coen, if you don't feed him enough, and if you go into important conversations, he can lose control and just kill off important NPCs,” Tomaszkiewicz reveals. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Rebel Wolves isn’t unique in creating a game in which you can kill significant characters, but it’s doing so in its own way. You can’t just stride up to someone and cut them down with your sword, for instance – it’s always to do with your vampiric urges. But you do have a choice. “You can decide to give into your vampiric nature whenever it comes knocking,” Tomaszkiewicz explains, describing it as “the whispers of your dark nature.” But that’s only possible if Coen is merely hungry. If you <em>starve </em>him, then every conversation is a roll of the dice. The hunger could seize control, and you’ll have no option but to watch him chow down. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>If you starve Coen, he can lose control and just kill off important NPCs.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">This system is possible thanks to that aforementioned “narrative sandbox” campaign structure. “In a game that has more of a strict core narrative, you couldn't kill off a character that is pivotal to the story, right? Because the story would fall apart,” notes Tomaszkiewicz. Since all quests in The Blood of Dawnwalker (aside from the first and last) are essentially optional, it means anyone can be killed without derailing the story. Instead, those deaths <em>become</em> the story. You can punish characters you hate, or be caught off-guard by surprise slaughter.     </p><p data-cy="paragraph">This bloodlust is part of a wider set of overlapping systems designed to make the kingdom of Vale Sangora feel alive. NPCs have routines, and they’ll raise the alarm if they see you stealing or feeding on their neighbours. Rival factions will brawl each other in the streets. And the evil Brencis watches you from afar. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“As you gain more notoriety in the valley, as you do these acts against Brencis, he won’t stay passive,” Tomaszkiewicz reveals. “He will enact these edicts that will hamper your progression. So he might send out more soldiers into the streets, or patrolling the roads, or enforce a curfew. So now it's more difficult to feed at night.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Notoriety initially sounds like GTA’s wanted level, or the escalating response of Metal Gear Solid’s guards. But it’s actually more complex than a simple difficulty spike. “Sometimes it can actually be a boon,” Tomaszkiewicz explains. “It's not just Brencis and his soldiers [who react to your notoriety,] it's also the people in the valley. They will recognize you and be afraid of you. So in some quest situations it actually might be helpful. There are some factions that fight against Brencis, they don't like him. So building up notoriety is actually a good way to gain a good standing with them.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h2 data-cy="title2">The End and Beyond</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">The narrative sandbox approach means Rebel Wolves has had to pay close attention to how the story ends. The ability to skip over every major quest, or kill off significant characters, means every player will hit the finale with different levels of knowledge. Some may not even know what a Dawnwalker is, while others will have found solutions to all the major problems. And so when I ask how many endings the story has, Tomaszkiewicz doesn’t have an easy answer. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“This is a very complicated web of connections,” he says. “I can tell you the designer working on the endings is… let's say <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/pepe-silvia" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the meme of [It’s Always Sunny in Philadelphia’s Charlie Day] with the red tape</a>. That's him basically. It is a lot of fun, but it's a lot to keep track of.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That’s not the only thing the story team needs to consider, either. The Steam page claims that this project is “the beginning of a brand-new saga built with love for the role-playing genre,” and so The Blood of Dawnwalker is just chapter one. The Rebel Wolves team may be building a game, but they are also building an entire universe that they plan to explore in subsequent games. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We have ideas for the overarching story of Coen,” reveals Tomaszkiewicz. He says sequels are, of course, not guaranteed, but the team has ideas of where to go should this first game be a success.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“There is much more in the IP than just vampires, let's say,” he teases. “There is this whole hidden world that we are not exploring on purpose in this first game. We want to leave a lot of fuel for the sequels and so on. But we do leave breadcrumbs and hint at these things. So yeah, we have a general idea of where we want to take Coen.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Such sequels and grander saga ambitions are beyond Rebel Wolves’ grasp for now, just as The Blood of Dawnwalker is beyond our own – at this year’s Gamescom, we were only able to watch a demonstration rather than go hands-on ourselves. And as exciting and promising as that demo was, it’ll take first-hand experience of the narrative sandbox to truly tell if the studio’s bold approach to RPG design has paid off. But just as Coen thirsts for the blood of mortals, I hunger to taste more of this fascinating, risk-taking Slavic fantasy.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Matt Purslow is IGN's Executive Editor of Features. </em></p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/the-blood-of-dawnwalker-interview-killing-time-and-major-npcs-in-ex-cdpr-devs-new-rpg]]></content:encoded>

<figure><a title="Drag X Drive Miis" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/ca5f41e28f0e2/drag-x-drive-miis.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>August is nearly over, and we've had two first-party releases this month: <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/kirby-and-the-forgotten-land-nintendo-switch-2-edition-plus-star-crossed-world">Kirby and the Long Title Nintendo Employees Are Obliged to Say in its Entirety</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/drag-x-drive">Drag x Drive</a>.</p>
<p>The Kirby revamp just came out (<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/kirby-and-the-forgotten-land-nintendo-switch-2-edition-plus-star-crossed-world">and it's very good</a>) while Drag and Drive (<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/opinion-we-need-to-talk-about-x-games">yes, this one's definitely an 'and'</a>) hit the courts back on 14th August. Are you still playing it? I'm willing to bet <em>dozens</em> of you are.</p>
<p>Ah, what a shame. For a game that demonstrates some genuine originality, it just throws up too many roadblocks for the average player, whether it's the novel but uncompromising Mouse Mode controls, the dreary presentation, or the restrictive online team options. It makes for an intriguing pitch — and it really is a blast in <em>exactly</em> the right circumstances — but will anyone be playing this come Christmas? Is anyone playing it now?</p>
<figure><a title="Joy-Con 2 Mouse Mode" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/2d7a0d5a6202e/joy-con-2-mouse-mode.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Damien McFerran / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>I found myself wishing I could just control the thing with standard stick and button inputs. I know that would circumvent the game's USP and introduce a skill gap, as people using buttons would quickly and easily (I imagine) outperform players sticking to motion controls, so you'd need to split the playerbase via control scheme.</p>
<p>And for a game that's designed to show you the real gameplay possibilities of Mouse Mode beyond the obvious (and beyond the minigames in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/nintendo-switch-2-welcome-tour">Welcome Tour</a>), optional button inputs would be tantamount to admitting defeat. "Yeah, this is <em>our</em> Mouse Mode showcase! But you don't <em>have to</em> use them.<sub>..and it's easier and better if you don't.</sub>"</p>
<p>I reckon Nintendo could frame it as an accessibility win without losing too much face. Ironically, players with any sort of movement impairment in their upper body will likely struggle the most playing Drag x Drive. And given the game's muted debut, alternative control schemes would likely draw in a far larger player base. It's not too late if Nintendo just swallowed its pride.</p>

<p>It's an odd one, because I admire the boldness of the idea and the mechanical execution. Only Nintendo would do something like this, but it's looking like a one-and-done affair for all but the most devoted players with the optimal setups (3v3 over LAN at the Nintendo Switch 2 Experience).</p>
<p>I had a great time with it back in April, and really hoped that would translate to the game proper, which I assumed would have more meat on the bone beyond the demo I played. Bolstered by Nate Bihldorff's comments in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/we-really-want-to-future-proof-the-nintendo-switch-2-interview">our interview</a> that, "in typical Nintendo fashion, there's more game beyond that," I assumed we'd seen only a small slice of the pie.</p>
<p>But no. Beyond the minigames, it's pretty much exactly what I played in April ad infinitum. Can you imagine what a difference a simple change of scenery would make? An outside court by the beach or up a mountain wouldn't fundamentally change anything, but would <em>drastically</em> improve the pervading presentational drabness. Perhaps Nintendo didn't want to distract from the novel mechanics with any trademark colour, but jeez. After half an hour you're jonesing for something beyond Burnished Black, Weathered Chrome, Medium Grey, Metallic Grey, Dark Grey, Dark Sea Grey, Neutral Grey, Grey Grey...</p>

<p>Or how about an injection of personality with some characters? Nintendo's got a few of those, right? <em>Something</em>. I thought <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/nintendo_switch_sports">Switch Sports</a> was bland, but Drag x Drive is crying out for some <em>verve</em> and charisma beyond the mechanical thrills.</p>
<p>Perhaps there's a sensitivity and reluctance on Nintendo's part to sitting Mario and co. in wheelchairs, and I understand that a whole other, valid conversation around representation would come from just slotting in Mushroom Kingdom characters that demonstrably, famously, have zero mobility issues. But featureless robots with customisation that extends to a splash of colour and some cat ears? They won't cause offence, sure, but they aren't a satisfactory solution. You can't even make them look like Daft Punk.</p>
<p>Just adding Miis would give the game 1000% more personality. You still wouldn't want to be stuck with it at a party, but right now it feels like a brick wall in the presentation department - a complete turn-off. That is, if the controls didn't make you <a href="https://c.tenor.com/yTxA7WgkBEUAAAAd/tenor.gif">Abe Simpson outta there</a> beforehand.</p>
<figure><a title="Joy-Con 2 Mouse Mode" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/623656888f3d6/joy-con-2-mouse-mode.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Damien McFerran / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Before launch, we'd worried that DxD might turn out to be Switch 2's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/arms">ARMS</a>, a game we loved and which still sold multiple millions of copies, but which didn't capture the audience it arguably deserved. Drag x Drive, though, feels like it ground to a halt almost immediately, not even able to sustain <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/nintendo_labo_toy-con_04_vr_kit">Labo</a>-levels of novelty. It's got my respect, but the surprise and delight was incredibly fleeting with this one. Imagine if it had an ounce of ARMS or <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/splatoon_3">Splatoon</a>'s style to go with the game.</p>
<p>Is there a way Nintendo could pivot and pull it back? Could Miis or regular button inputs change things for you? Would you be upset if they added DxD as a free-to-play perk for Nintendo Switch Online subscribers? Let us know in the polls and comments.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/discounty-adds-some-bite-to-cozy-life-sims.1284729/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>There’s a pleasing rhythm to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23878638/japanese-rural-life-adventure-apple-arcade-iphone-game">cozy life sims</a>. The virtual days pass, filled with chores of tending crops or running a business, punctuated by strange mysteries or evolving relationships. At their best, these games merge busywork with exploration and storytelling, in a way that makes them hard to step away from. <em>Discounty</em>, from developer Crinkle Cut Games, applies this idea to running a small-town supermarket. And while in many ways it can still be considered “cozy” like its contemporaries, it also comes with a bit of bite.</p><p>Instead of starting up your own business from scratch, <em>Discounty</em> has you taking over a grocery franchise from your cranky aunt in a small town that has seen better days. It’s a strange place; the most famous resident is the inventor of the keyring, and parts of the surrounding woods have been closed off for safety reasons. But it’s still friendly and comforting in the way small towns are, with a handful of residents who you’re really able to get to know over the course of the game. There’s also plenty of drama.</p><p>Actually running the store is your main job. From open to close, you are the only employee, so you have to deal with everything from managing the cash register — which involves, gasp, doing math — and keeping the shelves stocked so no one complains there’s no coffee or shampoo. But you also handle all the behind-the-scenes work: ordering new products, organizing the storage area, throwing out the trash, even negotiating with local vendors for fresh fish and produce. This part of the game is satisfying because it requires you to focus on what’s immediately in front of you (a bunch of picky customers) while also planning and strategizing for the future.</p><p>As you progress, your shop will expand both in terms of what you can sell and its physical size, which in turn makes the core gameplay loop more complex and challenging. In order to move things forward, though, you’ll have to get involved with the townsfolk. Working with local vendors usually means doing them some kind of favor, whether it’s finding some lost sheep or stocking gross Christmas-themed fish sticks. This can pull you down all kinds of narrative rabbit holes.</p><p>What’s most interesting about <em>Discounty</em>’s story is how it explores a number of real-world issues in its otherwise cozy and silly world. For starters, not everyone is happy about a big chain moving into town. When I finally expanded my shop’s footprint, usually a moment to celebrate in these kinds of games, everyone was mad because I did it by taking over an adjacent tea shop. The cafe had been shut down for years, but everyone still viewed it as an important part of the fabric of the community, and I was dismantling that.</p><p>Sometimes succeeding in the game isn’t actually good for the town itself. And while these threads often hide their darker edge behind humor — in order to get a construction permit, I had to help a city clerk dispose of environmental impact reports — <em>Discounty</em> is surprisingly sharp with its commentary, even if it never goes especially hard at any of its targets.</p><p>That mixture of satisfying gameplay and a story that’s both relatable and genuinely funny is what makes <em>Discounty</em> work so well. It’s not an escape to an idyllic farm or mountain getaway. It’s you doing a job that’s hard and not always pretty, while trying to make the best of things. Most of us know just what that’s like.</p><p><sub>Discounty <em>is available now on the Switch, PlayStation, Xbox, and PC.</em></sub></p><p><span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/games-review/768145/discounty-review-switch-ps5-xbox-steam#comments">0<!-- --> <!-- -->Comments</a></span></p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTk3"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Andrew Webster</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games-review/768145/discounty-review-switch-ps5-xbox-steam]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/the-exit-8-nintendo-switch-2-edition</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/mini-review-the-exit-8-nintendo-switch-2-edition-unnerving-horror-loop-is-worth-the-budget-price.1284708/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>To celebrate the newly-released <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=emZZexEJO8c">movie adaptation</a> of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/exit-8-nintendo-switch-2-edition">The Exit 8</a>, the Switch version has received a minor, yet welcome upgrade for the Switch 2.</p>
<p>If you're unaware of the premise, The Exit 8 takes place in a looping corridor within a Japanese metro station. Your job is to escape, but to do so, you’ll need to keep an eye on your surroundings, as each loop through the corridor may reveal some odd ‘anomalies’.</p>
<p>If there aren't any anomalies, you simply carry on, but if you spot something out of the ordinary, then you’ll have to turn back. You need to make the correct decision eight times in a row to escape, with a yellow sign indicating which ‘level’ you’re currently at. So if you get it wrong, you’ll reset right back down to zero.</p>
<p>The corridor itself is covered with white tiles, with posters on the left, a few doors on the right, and a sign up above labelled ‘Exit 8’. In each loop, you’ll spot a man walking in the opposite direction — briefcase in one hand, phone in the other. It’s important to keep note of small details like this, as potential anomalies are either blatantly obvious or exceedingly difficult to spot.</p>
<p>Some of the more subtle anomalies might be rearranged posters, a flickering light, or a door left slightly ajar. Meanwhile, the more obvious ones may be a pair of figures blocking your way, the briefcase man suddenly following you <em>very</em> closely, or what I can only assume is blood flooding the corridor. New anomalies have been added to pay homage to the movie, but unless you're intimately familiar with the original, you might not pick up on these.</p>
<p>Not knowing what's around the corner is a large part of what makes The Exit 8 so engaging, but it's also a source of frustration. There were many times I walked through the corridor utterly convinced that nothing had changed, only to find was back at level zero. So you need to take your time and be consistently observant.</p>
<p>On the Switch 2, the game’s performance has been given a nice bump, and it feels like it’s running at a stable 60fps. I wouldn’t say it’s a particularly pretty game, though, and the overall presentation is a little fuzzy in handheld mode, with text on the in-game posters looking quite blurry unless you’re standing right next to them.</p>
<p>I would've liked to see gyro aiming here too, just to make observation a little more intuitive, but the standard twin-stick setup works well enough. It’s such a simple game that every face and shoulder button does the exact same thing: sprint.</p>
<p>Overall, The Exit 8 is a cool experience that's worth trying for the low price, but not one I imagine going back to anytime soon. I wouldn’t call it scary, but there are definitely moments that made me feel uneasy. I think if the developer had really leaned into the horror and made something a bit closer to Hideo Kojima’s <strong>P.T</strong>, we could have had a modern classic here.</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/the-exit-8-nintendo-switch-2-edition]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/gamescom-2026-dates-location-and-ticket-sales-when-is-gamescom/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/gamescom-2026-dates-location-and-ticket-sales%E2%80%94when-is-gamescom-2026-happening.1284702/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Gamescom 2025 was a phenomenal event that broke records, seeing more exhibitors and guests pop up in Cologne than ever before. Next year’s show promises to be an even more ambitious event, and in this guide, we’re breaking down the Gamescom 2026 dates, location guides, and information regarding ticket sales.</p>



<p>If you’re interested in heading to Germany to check out Gamescom 2026, look no further than this guide to learn everything you need to know.</p>







<p>It has been confirmed that Gamescom 2026 will take place between August 26 and 30, 2026. This is later than usual; later than <strong>ever before</strong>, in fact. It’ll be the first Gamescom since 2009 to be held that close to the end of August.</p>



<p>Here are the dates of previous Gamescom events:</p>



<ul>
<li>(Gamescom 2026: 26 – 30 August)</li>



<li>Gamescom 2025: 20 – 24 August</li>



<li>Gamescom 2024: 20 – 24 August</li>



<li>Gamescom 2023: 23 – 27 August</li>



<li>Gamescom 2022: 24 – 28 August</li>



<li>Gamescom 2021: 25 – 27 August</li>



<li>Gamescom 2020: 25 – 29 August</li>



<li>Gamescom 2019: 20 – 24 August</li>



<li>Gamescom 2018: 21 – 25 August</li>



<li>Gamescom 2017: 22 – 25 August</li>



<li>Gamescom 2016: 17 – 21 August</li>
</ul>



<p>This means that Gamescom 2026 will start on Wednesday and run to Sunday, which follows the same format as the 2024 Gamescom. It hasn’t been confirmed, but it’s a very safe bet that Gamescom 2026 will kick off with the <strong>Opening Night Live </strong>showcase, which draws in millions of viewers from around the world.</p>







<p>Gamescom 2026 will take place at the Koelnmesse complex in Cologne, Germany. This sprawling venue plays host to more than 2,000 conferences every year, and Gamescom is arguably the gem of the bunch. It’s a complete takeover that seizes control of a dozen conference halls and expands across the entire city in many ways.</p>



<p>Gamescom has been held at the Koelnmesse since the first iteration in 2009, which drew the attention of 245,000 visitors.</p>



<p>It’s worth stressing that Cologne <a href="https://www.gamescom.global/en/gamescom-worldwide" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">isn’t the only location</a> for Gamescom events, as we now have Gamescom Asia and Gamescom LATAM.</p>



<p>Gamescom Asia is set to take place in Bangkok, Thailand, from October 16 – 19, 2025. Gamescom LATAM will appear in São Paulo, Brazil, from April 29 to May 3, 2026.</p>







<p>Gamescom 2026 tickets are not on sale at present and likely won’t be for quite some time. In 2025, tickets went on sale for the August showcase in April, four months before the event took place.</p>



<p>It’s safe to assume that the same structure will be followed for the 2026 show.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/amazon-is-selling-off-this-100w-usb-c-charger-block-with-3-ports-now-at-a-historic-low-price-2000621687</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/amazon-is-selling-off-this-100w-usb-c-charger-block-with-3-ports-now-at-a-historic-low-price.1284693/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Carrying around multiple chargers can be such a pain – your bag ends up heavy and overflowing with cables. Wouldn’t it be nice to have just one charger that handles all your devices at once? That’s exactly where this Baseus 100W USB-C charger block comes in: Right now, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3814/">it’s on Amazon for only $29, down from $49, which is a solid 40% off</a> – definitely a steal at this all-time low price.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3814/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Three Ports</h2>
<p>This small charger is a monster with three ports: <strong>two USB-C and one USB-A</strong>. That means you can charge your phone, tablet and even laptop all at once without having to switch back and forth between several different plugs. And don’t worry about it being slow: <strong>it delivers up to 100 watts in total power</strong> which is more than enough to fast-charge something like a MacBook Pro or any other laptop while still keeping your phone and tablet topped up. It’s got this smart PPS technology that adjusts the power depending on what you’re charging so your devices don’t get too much juice and stay safe.</p>
<p>What I totally adore is the way the plug folds: When you’re all done charging, <strong>you just fold it up and it’s really tiny</strong>. It fits perfectly into your bag or even a large pocket, no bulky charger bricks weighing you down. And it’s durable, so you don’t have to worry about destroying it after a few recharges. It’s compatible with so many of the most popular devices, like the new iPhone 16, Galaxy S54, iPad, and so forth, so that you don’t have to be carrying a separate charger for every gadget.</p>



<p>Even when it’s charging three devices at a time, this charger keeps up with the speed: <strong>The USB-C ports split that 100W among themselves in a way that each device gets enough current to charge in a rush</strong>, and the USB-A port also provides fast charging so the old devices get a speed boost without being left behind.</p>
<p>Safety features are also spot on. It’s got inbuilt safeguards to <strong>protect your belongings from overheating, short circuits, or overcharging</strong>. So don’t worry about leaving your devices plugged in overnight. It’s also energy efficient, meaning less wasted power and smaller dent on your electricity bill.</p>
<p>Get it at this sale price while it lasts, and be on your way to quicker and simpler charging of all your electronics wherever you are.</p>

            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/08/30/destiny-rising-how-to-get-bon-voyage-charms-quickly/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/destiny-rising-%E2%80%93-how-to-get-bon-voyage-charms-quickly.1284687/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Bon Voyage Charms and Bon Voyage Charms L.E. are the Gacha currency for NetEase’s new game, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/destiny-rising">Destiny: Rising</a>. In other words, these are what you need to use to unlock extra characters and other bonuses. As the game has just launched, there are lots of ways to get Bon Voyage Charms for free.</p>
<h3>How to get Bon Voyage Charms</h3>
<p>The easiest and quickest way right now is to play the PvP and PvPvE activities which are Singularity and Shifting Gates. There are daily limits on the rewards, but Singularity currently has a load of special first-time completion rewards that can be won to earn Bon Voyage Charms. You will also need to spend some Pinnacle Energy to play Singularity, that currency has a max of 360 and you earn 120 every day, and a run of Singularity will cost you 20 Pinnacle Energy.</p>
<p>You can also buy Bon Voyage Charms from a number of places. You can get them by exchanging 180 Lumia Leaves, another currency that can be earned in game, or for Translation Credits which are earned when playing Shifting Gates, and finally you can exchange Crystal Dust for them in the Fortuna shop.</p>



<p>As mentioned, there are lots of other ways to earn Bon Voyage charms during the launch window, including:</p>

<ul>
<li>The Weekly Sign-in Bonus</li>
<li>The “Spreading Light” referral program, invite pals and earn Bon Voyage charms as they level up.</li>
<li>Character Quests</li>
<li>Primary Quests</li>
<li>Chapter Objectives</li>
<li>Primary Quests</li>
<li>Destination Exploration and Destination Reputation Rewards</li>
<li>Pre-registration rewards : If you did sign up before the game launched, you should have some Charms waiting for you when you log in.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can keep track of many of the Rewards by going to the Events page and tapping on the Rewards Guide. You can also track Lumia Leaf rewards here, which can be turned in to Bon Voyage Charms.</p>
<h3>How to get Bon Voyage Charms L.E.</h3>
<p>For Bon Voyage Charms L.E. (Limited Edition) you are probably going to have to get your wallet out. These can only be used to claim characters who are available for a limited time. They can be bought via a number of methods:</p>
<ul>
<li>At the Fortuna Shop where you can purchase them using Silver</li>
<li>As Rewards from the Premium Battle Pass</li>
</ul>
<p>You can also exchange Fortuna Crystals and Fortuna Crystal dust for Bon Voyage Charms L.E. but you need rather a lot and you can only do this five times a month.</p>

<figure><a title="Kirby and the Forgotten Land - Switch 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/c573620e4dbb2/kirby-and-the-forgotten-land-switch-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>The weekend has crept up on us once again, so it's time to kick back with a game or two.</p>
<p>Before we get to our plans, however, let's look back on all the Nintendo news that happened this week. Honestly, it was a rather quiet one. Nintendo launched a series of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/nintendo-releases-its-me-mario-stop-motion-shorts-watch-them-right-here">stop-motion Mario shorts</a> and the kid-focused <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/hello_mario">Hello, Mario!</a> app in Japan (which we went <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/nintendos-new-app-reminds-me-of-a-universal-truth-it-feels-good-to-squash-marios-face">hands-on</a> with), rumours of a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/rumour-a-nintendo-direct-is-reportedly-coming-ahead-of-marios-40th-anniversary">September Nintendo Direct</a> started bubbling away, and The Pokémon Company revealed another <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/pokemon-legends-z-as-latest-mega-evolution-looks-particularly-snazzy">new Mega Evolution</a> for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pokemon_legends_z-a">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a>.</p>
<p>We also shared our reviews on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/kirby-and-the-forgotten-land-nintendo-switch-2-edition-plus-star-crossed-world">Kirby and the Forgotten Land - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition + Star-Crossed World</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/roadwarden">Roadwarden</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/story-of-seasons-grand-bazaar-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Story of Seasons: Grand Bazaar</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/shantae_advance_risky_revolution">Shantae: Risky Revolution</a>.</p>
<p>So, what's on the cards for this weekend?</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/nintendo-switch-2/related-articles:187146,187176 @ 1756575698 -->
<h2>Jim Norman, Staff Writer</h2>
<p>I have never played Kirby and the Forgotten Land before, so I'm putting that right with the catchily-titled Switch 2 version. I've only played through the first world at this point, but what a sweet little 3D platformer! I'm very much excited to get cosy and play some more of it this weekend.</p>
<p>And I'm keeping Kirby as my main focus for this one. I really want to have it polished off before a certain metroidvania comes to gobble up all my time next week...</p>

<h2>Kate Gray, Contributor</h2>
<p>I am fully on the Story of Seasons: Grand Bazaar train. Choo Choo. I think the game originally came out at a time when I was probably busy doing some boring school-related thing, so I never actually played the original. Also, I guess I always assumed it was a spin-off? Like the Harvest Moon match-3 game, Frantic Farming? I think they came out within a year of each other and I just assumed they were the same kind of thing. Anyway, the remake is pretty great! It's perhaps a little TOO easy — I'm still in spring of year one and I feel like I've made a ton of progress already — but I think they've finally discovered an art style that doesn't look super cheap or derivative! Hooray. I'd still like the character art to look a little less child-like, but we're making progress at least!</p>
<h2>Gavin Lane, Editor</h2>
<p>It's a busy one for me. As Alana mentioned <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/poll-ahead-of-silksongs-release-are-you-finally-playing-hollow-knight">earlier this week</a>, I've finally started <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/hollow_knight">Hollow Knight</a>! I'm not sure it's going to have the life-changing impact on me that others experienced seven or eight years ago, but I've enjoyed the couple of hours I've played so far and I'm itching to explore more. But! <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/star_trek_resurgence">Star Trek: Resurgence</a> launched on Switch this week - I've been anxious to play that since 2023.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/ufo_50">UFO 50</a> is also an utter delight. I completed my first game the other day (well, I got the Gold cart, but there's loads more I could do) - Avianos, the turn-based, dinosaur, castle-conquering one. I've still barely touched the vast majority of the others, but what a treat this thing is. You'll be hearing me wax lyrical come December, guaranteed.</p>
<p>And on the theme of dinosaurs, I picked up <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/lego_jurassic_world">LEGO Jurassic World</a> on sale this week. Following a blisteringly successful viewing of the first film, my kids are obsessed with Jurassic Park and I'm along for the ride, grinning wildly and shedding a tear when they sing along to those John Williams themes and overspending on the 30th anniversary sets Lego released a couple of years ago. You know, for the kids. Compared to the actual Lego, €3.99 for the game is an absolute steal, and it's also the best way to show them the rest of the movies without actually showing them the rest of the movies. Let 'em dream, hmm?</p>

<h2>Ollie Reynolds, Staff Writer</h2>
<p>I'm still playing quite a lot of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/street-fighter-6-years-1-2-fighters-edition">Street Fighter 6</a> at the moment, but the recent reminder that Game Vouchers are on their way out has prompted me to dive back into <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/pikmin_2">Pikmin 2</a>. Y'see, I'd like to use the vouchers to get the third and fourth games, but I'd also like to complete the second before I, y'know, start the process. OCD, I guess.</p>
<p>I really want to play some <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/shinobi_art_of_vengeance">SHINOBI: Art of Vengeance</a> too, and you better believe I'll be sinking a few more hours into the new <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/lumines_arise">Lumines Arise</a> demo on PS5 before it disappears!</p>
<h2>Alana Hagues, Deputy Editor</h2>
<p>After finishing <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/chibi-robo">Chibi-Robo</a> last weekend, I’ll finally be wrapping up <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/pipistrello_and_the_cursed_yoyo">Pipistrello and the Cursed Yoyo</a>, which has gone completely under the radar but is one of the best games I’ve played this year. Creative movement, challenging puzzles, all wrapped up in a Zelda-style overworld with a Metroidvania-esque structure? It’s excellent; do yourself a favour and pick it up.</p>
<p>Otherwise, no new games for me this week (you know why), but I will be downloading that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/trails-in-the-sky-1st-chapter-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Trails in the Sky 1st Chapter</a> demo. I’m glad people who’ve never played the series before are checking this one out, and I’m eager to see what the fuss is about with this remake. Enjoy your weekend, folks!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The next season of <em>Kill Team</em> launches with a brand new box, featuring a new setting, new kill teams, and new missions.&nbsp;In this article, we'll take a look at the new kill teams and what else <em>Kill Team</em> Tomb World adds to your games.</p>

<p><em>Kill Team</em> is a skirmish wargame set in Games Workshop's larger <em>Warhammer 40,000</em> setting. As a skirmish game, <em>Kill Team</em> features a small number of elite troops, fighting special operations battles, rather than huge battles fought with entire armies. We've covered <em>Kill Team</em> in depth since the first edition, and you can read our review of the current <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/kill-team-starter-set-review" rel="nofollow">Starter Set</a> here.</p>




<h2>The Awoken And The Purgers</h2>

<p><em>Kill Team</em>&nbsp;Tomb World, although a huge box, is an expansion for <em>Kill Team</em>, and while it contains a lot of content, it requires a copy of the Kill Team core rulebook, dice, and a measuring tool to use. As with previous expansions, it&nbsp;adds 2 brand new kill teams, a new set of non-player operative miniatures and missions, and because it's the start of the new season, it includes the core terrain for this season's kill zone.</p>

<p>The full box contents are:</p>

<p><em>Kill Team</em> Tomb World is the start of the next season of <em>Kill Team</em>, which means that the <a href="https://www.warhammer-community.com/en-gb/articles/oEk5abZ8/kill-team-managing-the-range-of-kill-teams-in-the-new-edition/" rel="nofollow">kill team rotation</a> previously detailed by Games Workshop will come into effect. We should expect a full updated article on which kill teams are legal for tournament play, but all kill teams with existing rules in this edition will still be balance updated and can be used for any games outside of tournaments.</p>

<p>With the new season, we also expect the <em>Kill Team</em> <a href="https://www.warhammer-community.com/en-gb/articles/mhstieyb/kill-team-approved-ops-2025-snatch-the-initiative-and-secure-new-objectives/" rel="nofollow">Approved Ops 2025 card pack</a> to release alongside Tomb World. This card pack updates the Tac Ops for the 4&nbsp;archetypes, along with new and returning Crit Ops and the standard Kill Op. It also includes new map layouts for&nbsp;Killzones Volkus, Bheta-decima, Gallowdark, and the new Tomb World.</p>

<p>Before <em>Kill Team</em> existed as a game, the Deathwatch used the name to describe the temporary groups of Space Marines pulled from every chapter to serve in the Deathwatch's core function of eliminating the Xenos threat. These Space Marines don black armor during their service, leaving only one shoulder pauldron painted in the colors of their original chapter. They then get access to the intelligence and specialised wargear that allows the Deathwatch to serve their purpose.</p>

<p>The Deathwatch kill team has access to 11 operatives, but fields 5 in a kill team. This gives you a huge amount of flexibility going into battle, allowing you to tailor your forces to respond to your opponent. The Tomb World set includes enough sprues to let you build 10 Deathwatch marines, allowing you to build nearly one of each type (having to make a choice between 2 of the 3 Gravis armored marines). This means you can build 2 entire Deathwatch kill teams for games of Joint Ops using the Tomb World or other joint ops rules.</p>

<p>The standout Deathwatch marines for us, and our first Deathwatch kill team loadout, are the Watch Sergeant, who can use a strategy and firefight ploy once per battle for free. The Blademaster Veteran, who wields a Xenophase blade and can fight against every enemy in its control range. The frag cannon-wielding Bombard Veteran who has 2 fire options, the very high damage shell or the torrent ruled shrapnel. The Gunner Veteran, armed with a heavy plasma incinerator, and the Marksman Veteran, who can go on guard to punish any enemies moving into their view, and when using the close quarters rules, immediately go back on guard after performing a shoot action.</p>

<p>All the Deathwatch Marines can perform 2 shoot or fight actions each turn, and can also perform an additional (but different) single point action when they counteract. The Deathwatch also have access to special ammunition, which can be used once per turning point to add 1 of 7 special rules to a shooting attack.</p>

<p>The Necrons are the robotic undead of a long-forgotten empire, sleeping in tombs and awakening when disturbed. Serving the forgotten masters of this sleeping empire are Crypteks, engineers who seek to further their own agendas, whilst serving their masters. The Canoptek Circle kill team are led by a Geomancer Cryptek who can change the form of matter to move through physical barriers, or aggressively to utterly destroy their targets. Supporting the Geomancer are Canoptek constructs, mindless thrawls acting out their will.</p>

<p>The Canoptek Circle has a fixed kill team roster, led by the powerful Geomancer who can use their abilities to damage all operatives near a scenery piece, and move them, or any other friendly operative through walls. The Canoptek Circle deploys 3 obelisk node tokens at the start of the game. These tokens can be used to control uncontest objectives and also create a node matrix if they are within 6 inches of another node, boosting the kill team's abilities if friendly operatives are within the node matrix.</p>

<p>Backing up the Geomancer are 2 Tomb Crawlers, which are large mobile weapons platforms, 1 Accelerator, who can boost other Canoptek operatives' action points by 1, 1 Macroctye Reanimator, who can heal and resurrect other operatives, and 3 Warriors, who aren't very durable, but can damage nearby enemies when killed, and respawn at the start of your turn in your dropzone.</p>

<p><em>Kill Team</em>&nbsp;Tomb World is a fantastic start to the new season. The box contains enough miniatures for 3 kill teams (2x 5-man Deathwatch and 1 Canoptek Circle kill team), plus 13 extra NPO miniatures for solo and cooperative play, along with enough scenery to fill a game board with walls to capture the claustrophobic feel of a Necron Tomb.</p>

<p>As a Space Marine player myself, it's great to see the original kill team finally represented, and the fact that you get enough miniatures to build 2 whole Deathwatch kill teams out of the box gives you an insane amount of variety when putting your roster together, or play joint ops straight out of the box. The Canoptek Circle kill team are also very interesting, with a powerful leader and 2 strong weapons platforms, with the respawning warriors that your opponent will never fully get rid of. They offer a thematic Necron experience, as you can throw warriors at your opponent without a care.</p>

                <p>The announcement that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/hollow-knight-silksong/" data-ref-id="5000-493311">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a> would release on September 4 was such a surprise that even the most tuned-in Hollow Knight fans were in shock at the news. And now, just days before Silksong releases, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/hollow-knight/" data-ref-id="5000-448603">Hollow Knight</a> is seeing a renaissance with gamers, passing its Steam concurrents records over and over again, hitting a new peak of 56,192 players on August 29, <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/367520/charts/#1w" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">according to SteamDB</a>.</p><p>For years, Hollow Knight's biggest day was in May of 2022 when the game had over 20,000 concurrent players. Since the announcement of Silksong's impending release date, though, each consecutive day has seen that concurrent peak rising, having <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hollow-knight-just-hit-an-all-time-peak-on-steam-after-silksong-release-date-reveal/1100-6534206/" data-ref-id="1100-6534206">hit 21,000 on August 22</a>, just a day after the announcement, and hit 56,192 today. For a seven-year-old indie game, this is pretty big.</p><p>Of course, it's important to note that SteamDB is not the be-all-end-all of game stats. Steam is a dominant platform for sure, but Hollow Knight is available on all last and current-generation consoles, including Nintendo Switch, PlayStation, and Xbox, with Switch being a particularly popular platform for the game. Even so, it's indicative that the legend of Hollow Knight continues to grow.</p><p>We got a sneak peek last week, and signs are looking good. "Hollow Knight: Silksong appears to be exactly what we all should have expected: a strong, well-designed, visually lovely game that carries forward the aesthetic and design philosophies of the original with thoughtful, if not earth-shattering, updates," GameSpot's Steve Watts wrote after going <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hollow-knight-silksong-is-real-and-i-played-it/1100-6534147/" data-ref-id="1100-6534147">hands-on with Silksong at Gamescom</a>.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/borderlands-4-endgame-and-post-launch-roadmap-detailed-by-gearbox-at-pax-west.1284669/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>During the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q-Hw3clSJDo" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gearbox Main Theatre Show</a> at PAX West, the Texas-based game developer unveiled the endgame and post-launch roadmap for Borderlands 4, which is due to launch in less than two weeks. In the upcoming game, players will continue to progress their characters through weekly challenge missions and unlockable specializations to further customize their loadout.</p>



<p>Ultimate Vault Hunter Mode is returning, albeit reimagined from previous iterations. This post-game difficulty option challenges players with five unlockable levels that increase in difficulty. Additionally, based on lessons learned from previous games in the franchise, players no longer need to replay the campaign to gain new ranks. Instead, players will advance through curated mission challenges that test their chosen build. These challenges grow more difficult as players progress, eliminating the need to re-farm the same gear.</p>



<p>Each Ultimate Vault Hunter Mode rank includes exclusive Firmware set bonuses for gear that players will first find while playing the campaign. The first loot drops with Firmware should start appearing around level 25. The more Firmware a player acquires, the higher their stat bonus will be. These powerful bonuses can be transferred to another item once, after which the original item is destroyed, and the firmware bonus cannot be transferred again.</p>



<p>Multiple incentives will be provided to encourage Borderlands 4 players to continue searching for the best loot. Weekly Wildcards offer rotating missions with a guaranteed Legendary reward. In the Weekly Big Encore Boss, Moxxi’s Big Encore selects one boss for the week that can be unlocked with Eridium for a larger iteration with increased drop rates.</p>



<p>The Maurice's Black Market Machine sends players across Kairos in search of its spoils, offering varied loot for every player. These activities are all available for online matchmaking, as you'd expect in this type of game.</p>



<figure><a href="https://assets.2k.com/1a6ngf98576c/1xMGxsFasYPMmGHR0A89LW/a524992219bfe143ef7a32a04f5a3b92/BL4_Post-Launch-Roadmap-1920x1080__1_.jpg"></a></figure>



<p>Gearbox Software then switched to discuss the game's post-launch roadmap, starting with the free updates. Seasonal Mini-Events will kick off in October with Horrors of Kairos offering new Legendary Weapons, Cosmetics, and a new Weather Variant. Invincible Bosses are also returning to test players’ skill and build inside high-level new boss arenas that integrate the new traversal mechanics introduced with Borderlands 4. Powerful new Legendaries are the juicy rewards for players strong enough to defeat Invincible Bosses. Additionally, a new Ultimate Vault Hunter Mode level will release alongside each Invincible Boss.</p>



<p>As for the paid DLCs, there will be two types: Story Pack and Bounty Pack. The first of two announced story packs, scheduled for Q1 2026, features the return of fan-favorite Ellie in "Mad Ellie and the Vault of the Damned." With a cosmic horror theme and a bloodier, darker tone than the main campaign, this Story Pack includes an all-new region of Kairos to explore, multiple engaging main and side missions, and all-new legendary gear. It also introduces the first post-launch playable Vault Hunter. Additionally, this pack includes four new Vault Hunter skins, two new vehicle skins, three ECHO-4 drone skins, and one ECHO-4 frame, as well as attachments.</p>



<p>The first Bounty Pack will arrive earlier than that, in Q4 2025. In Bounty Packs, Borderlands 4 players will experience narrative-based missions that expand the universe. These missions reveal more about the new characters players encounter on Kairos, beginning with Rush, the gregarious leader of the Outbounders. Each Bounty Pack includes new main missions, a new boss, new legendary gear, one player skin, one ECHO-4 drone skin, one new vehicle, and a Vault card. This allows players to unlock 24 cosmetics and four pieces of rerollable gear.</p>



<p>The second Bounty Pack will land in Q1 2026 alongside the Pearlescent items (which will be free). Pearlescent gear drops will be challenging to find, but their power level matches their coveted rarity. Borderlands 4 is out <a href="https://wccftech.com/borderlands-4-gold/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on September 12</a> for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X, while Nintendo Switch 2 fans <a href="https://wccftech.com/borderlands-4-nintendo-switch-2-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">must wait until October 3</a> to play it. </p>

                <p>In celebrating the legacy of Battlefield, EA recently released a new battle pass for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/battlefield-2042/" data-ref-id="5000-532981">Battlefield 2042</a>. Called “Road to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/battlefield-6/" data-ref-id="5000-687940">Battlefield 6</a>”, it features unlockable skins and cosmetic items that represent different games in the series. What’s most notable about the pass--beyond the fact that’s completely free--is that it also includes 20 item unlocks for the upcoming Battlefield 6.</p><p>Like most battle passes, the unlockable items are grouped into levels or tiers. In Tier 8, for instance, players will be able to unlock a Battlefield 1 era player card background, card icon, weapon package and more. There are even a few vehicle and soldier skins up for grabs at the later levels; fans looking to unlock the Aurora Vehicle Skin from Battlefield Bad Company 2, for instance, can do so after hitting Tier 30.</p>

<p>"Just two months to go"</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Square Enix locked in an October release date for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/dragon-quest-i-and-ii-hd-2d-remake">Dragon Quest I &amp; II HD-2D Remake</a> earlier this year, and if you've been wanting an update about how it's progressing, it's now gone gold!</p>
<p>To mark this milestone, the official <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/dragon_quest">Dragon Quest</a> social media account <a href="https://x.com/DragonQuest/status/1961625174115295508">shared a photo</a> of remake producer Masaaki Hayasaka alongside industry legend and "father of Dragon Quest", Yuji Horii. The team has also taken the time to remind everyone how there's now "just two months to go" until this anticipated release arrives.</p>
<figure><a title="Dragon Quest" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/b1837c7d8e94e/dragon-quest.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Square Enix</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>The pair actually <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2024/09/dragon-quest-iii-hd-2d-remake-has-officially-gone-gold-out-this-november">took a similar snap</a> when <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/dragon_quest_iii_hd-2d_remake">Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake</a> went gold on Switch and other platforms in September 2024.</p>
<p>While this might not seem like much to be excited about, for the developers behind upcoming releases, going gold means main development is complete and ready for the production phase. Of course, teams can still make smaller improvements before launch, and then there's post-launch support <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/dragon-quest-iii-hd-2d-remake-gets-free-switch-2-performance-patch">in the form of updates</a> and DLC. This kind of news can also be another reassuring sign that everything is still on track.</p>
<p>When Dragon Quest I &amp; II HD-2D Remake does launch for the Switch and Switch 2 on <strong>30th October 2025</strong>, fans will need to buy the game on the Nintendo platform of their choice, as Square Enix has already confirmed <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/square-enix-rules-out-switch-2-upgrade-path-for-dragon-quest-i-and-ii-hd-2d-remake">there's no upgrade path currently planned</a>. Additionally, Switch 2 DLC codes can only be used with this particular version of the game (the same applies to the Switch release).</p>

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/hands-on-with-kaiju-no-8-the-game</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/hands-on-with-kaiju-no-8-the-game.1284621/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">In the world of Kaiju No. 8, titanic, otherworldly beasts are a constant threat in Japan: to the extent that not only is there a military organisation – the Japan Anti-Kaiju Defense Force (JAKDF) – set up to deal with them, but there are also regimented clean-up crews whose jobs are to come in and cut up then cart away the often skyscraper-sized foes once they’ve been felled.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Lead character Kafka Hibino dreams of being a JAKDF officer, but at the start of the series is working in clean-up, and hoping that when there’s work to be done he doesn’t get assigned the intestines… for obvious reasons. It’s not long, however, before he’s – <em>season one spoiler alert here</em> – both a member of the JAKDF and dealing with the fact that he’s somehow been gifted/cursed with the powers of a kaiju himself, designated by the powers that be as Kaiju No. 8.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Stylish action, goofy humour and bad-ass characters all come together to make what follows a whole heap of fun, and frankly, excellent fodder for a video game. Why so? Well, in terms of action, the series focuses around squad-based combat against bizarre and menacing enemies both large and small, with battles decided by exposing each creature’s core (i.e. weak point) and finishing it off. Pair that with highly individual characters, who have a range of expertise in different weapons and fighting styles, and you’ve got a video game waiting to happen.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Enter Akatsuki Games, and Kaiju No. 8 The Game. This free-to-play turn-based RPG on mobile (with PC to follow) very much fits the mold for modern Japanese live service mobile games, with gacha rolls for characters and weapons, and numerous different currencies and crafting materials that allow you to level up characters, moves, weapons and more. This is a game with daily check in rewards, time-limited events and grinding for materials so you can enhance your characters and take on the next challenge.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Whether that’s your kind of thing is up to you, but there’s no doubt that the team has put a lot of effort into this title. Akatsuki Games has been working on Kaiju No. 8 The Game for more than two years – since well before the anime started airing – with a team size of around 200 people. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The result is a game with excellent presentation, thanks to well-realised 3D character models, a good sense of scale, and super slick combat animations. The core gameplay loop is compelling too, putting you in control of a four person squad in turn-based battles that move quickly and have plenty of room for strategic depth. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Kaiju No. 8 The Game also has an impressive amount of content out of the gate. Not only does it have an original story to play through (set during the second season of the anime, which is airing now), complete with an impressive amount of voice acting (in Japanese), but it has other modes that highlight iconic moments from the manga/anime’s story, tell side stories for the main characters, and so on. It even has a side-scrolling combat mini-game.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/08/29/side-scrolling-mini-game-1756461272866.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Kaiju No. 8's side-scrolling combat mini-game.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Let’s dig into some of the specifics.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>What’s the Story?</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">In Kaiju No. 8 The Game, Dimensional Gates are opening up in the sky and a stream of kaiju threats are swarming out. Is this a job for the JAKDF? Yes, but with a little help from CLOZER (that’s the rather awkward “Closing Order With Zero Restrictions”, in case you’re curious), a special organisation tasked with sealing said gates. The plot twist, however, is that the captain of CLOZER is Sagan Shinomiya – one of a handful of brand new characters – and fan fave Kikoru Shinomiya’s sister.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The set-up allows for a never-ending stream of gameplay as you fight through the kaiju from a particular gate, culminating in a boss battle and closing the gate, then moving on to another. It’s a fun premise, however, as the gates themselves connect to a different dimension, meaning that iconic kaiju that have already been neutralised in Kaiju No. 8’s world can still appear, allowing the game to dive into battles only referenced in the manga/anime. My hands-on, for instance, culminated in a fight with an alternate version of the legendary Kaiju No. 2. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/08/29/kaiju-no-2-1756461366397.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Kaiju No. 2.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Another important point is that while the manga/anime is set entirely in Japan, these gates are opening up globally, so the game can roam all over the place. You can imagine how a live service title might take advantage of travelling to different parts of the world.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In addition to Sagan, and a couple of other entirely new characters, Kaiju No. 8 The Game is packing all the series mainstays you’d expect, from the captain of the Third Division Mina Ashiro (and her tiger Bakko) and her vice captain Soshiro Hoshina, through to the captain of the First Division (and otaku slacker) Gen Narumi and Kafka’s partner Reno Ichikawa. Each, as you would expect, has a signature weapon and fighting style, from Hoshina’s twin swords through to Sagan’s shield, which she uses like a blunt weapon.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Kafka’s Ultimate sees him transform into Kaiju No. 8… giving him a completely different set of moves.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Kafka is perhaps the most interesting, as he is essentially two characters in one. All the other fighters unleash a flashy attack when their Ultimate is triggered in battle, but Kafka’s Ultimate sees him transform into Kaiju No. 8 for the rest of the encounter, giving him a completely different set of moves.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Kaiju No. 8 The Game Screenshots</h3></div></output><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Squad Up!</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">The battle system lets you choose a squad of four before each mission, and the order in which you place them creates two pairs of “battle buddies”, dictating who executes follow-up attacks when you expose a kaiju’s core. (More on that in a sec.)</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Combat is turn-based, with the upcoming move order shown at the bottom of the screen. As you’d expect, characters have a wide array of options from single and multi-target strikes through to buffs and debuffs, but there are a couple of key systems that open up strategy. The first is that your party has a shared SP pool (mana, essentially). A normal attack restores a pip, while using a combat skill depletes one. This approach means you need to be tactical in how you manage your resources in order to use your characters’ most powerful techniques.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">On top of this is the system for exposing an enemy’s core – a pivotal part of combat in the manga/anime that’s been brought across to the game. Enemies have discreet shields (called plates) that reduce the amount of damage they’ll take, so the main priority in any combat encounter is working out the most efficient way to break them. Some plates can be broken with any attack, others require specific types of attacks. You might need to use an elemental attack, or even more specifically, an attack utilising one of the five elements in the game (fire, ice, wind, lightning and water). Obviously different characters have different types of attacks, so ensuring your squad has the affinities necessary for the combat encounter you’re going into is key.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Breaking enemy plates is vital because once you destroy them all, the kaiju in question’s core is exposed, triggering an automatic follow-up attack from the attacking character’s partner and forcing the foe to skip a turn, bumping it back down the turn order sequence at the bottom of screen. It’s pretty satisfying knocking a kaiju back just as it’s about to attack, or better yet, preventing it from unleashing its Ultimate.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking of Ultimates, each character has a gauge that fills as they fight (with follow-up attacks boosting it significantly), and these are – as you’d expect – some of the flashiest and strongest attacks in the game. Ultimates are great for finishing off kaiju with their core exposed, and can be triggered at any time, overriding the upcoming attack order. One thing to bear in mind is that missions are made up of several combat encounters, one after the other (with fast-paced ninja running in between, as the squad sprint to the next battle), and your SP pool and Ultimate charges carry over from battle to battle so, if the final encounter is significantly harder, you can prep for it.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/08/29/ultimate-cut-scene-kaiju-no-8-1756461500781.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Missions are made up of several combat encounters.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Combat overall is fast and slick, letting each character show off their individual styles while also working as a team. You’re generally fighting smaller kaiju that attack in groups, but the game does also pit you against the kinds of towering monsters the manga/anime is known for, with the camera set low to really help sell the scale of the encounters.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Enhancing and Ascending</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">There’s a good strategic foundation to Kaiju No. 8 The Game’s combat, but as with most RPGs, your characters need to be constantly leveling to keep up with the opposition you’ll face next. There are a somewhat overwhelming number of systems in place to allow your characters to grow more powerful, and they’re pretty much all centered around material drops.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Just to quickly give you an idea, you use Defense Force Manuals (of which there are several rarities), along with credits, to “enhance” (i.e. level up) your characters. These all drop from playing the game and are essentially spendable XP. Initially your characters max out at level 20, but the level caps can be expanded, boosting the character in question and also increasing the challenge level of story missions and opening up higher difficulty training options. (Training, incidentally, is how you get the materials to enhance individual skills, but is subject to a stamina system.)</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Kaiju No. 8 The Game Gameplay</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Characters can also “Ascend”. This requires you to have a double of the character and other resources, and gives you a bonus perk. On top of all this you can enhance your characters’ weapons and individual skills. There’s a lot to keep track of, and it feels like you’ll need to have a decent pool of competitive characters in order to swap your squad around if you need specific plate-breaking abilities, which means engaging with a tonne of different collectables.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">New weapons and characters are acquired through the game’s gacha rolls, and utilise a star system for rarity. For the most part you’ll be getting three star weapons, and it remains to be seen how many rolls free-to-play players will be able to generate, as well as how fairly priced the gacha system will be for paying players. One thing is certain, though – the pool of characters and weapons is pretty large, and the rarest drops infrequent, so if you’re hunting for something specific, it may be a long process. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Despite the many trappings of free-to-play mobile game design, Kaiju No. 8 The Game’s moment to moment gameplay has a lot going for it, with clever core battle mechanics, slick animations and impressive visuals. And with its strong emphasis on story, and clear reverence for the source material, this adaptation will definitely be worth a look for fans of the series. Kaiju No. 8 The Game is out on August 31.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Cam Shea visited Akatsuki Games in Tokyo as a guest.

<p>Keep on rollin'</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Last February, you might recall how our retro-focused sibling site <a href="https://www.timeextension.com/news/2024/02/3d-platformer-rollin-rascal-is-a-colourful-love-letter-to-sonic?utm_campaign=related-articles&amp;utm_medium=web&amp;utm_source=nintendolife.com&amp;utm_content=in-article"><strong>Time Extension</strong></a> highlighted a new high-speed game called <strong><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/rollin_rascal">Rollin' Rascal</a></strong>.</p>
<p>At the time, <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/curiomatic/rollin-rascal">this Kickstarter project</a> (drawing inspiration from 3D <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/sonic-x-shadow-generations">Sonic</a> platformers and even <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_bros_wonder">Mario</a>) had just reached its Nintendo Switch goal, and now, well over a year later, the development team Curiomatic has revealed the title will be coming to the Switch 2.</p>
<p>This information was shared during the developer's recent Direct-style video presentation:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Rollin' Rascal will be released on Nintendo Switch and Nintendo Switch 2."</p>
</blockquote>
<figure><a title="Rollin' Rascal" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/f74da66cc2559/rollin-rascal.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Curiomatic</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>As the original Switch version was a stretch goal, the developer further notes how the console ports (in general) will begin production once the full game is complete.</p>
<p>There's no set release date for this title just yet, but <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2740750/Rollin_Rascal/">a demo is currently available on Steam</a>, and the team plans to roll out the game's story mode in chapters, starting with the first chapter "early next year". As for the full launch, according to the Kickstarter page, it's estimated to be delivered at some point in June 2026.</p>
<p>Here's a description detailing what exactly you can expect, and the rundown video above goes into the latest development updates.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Rollin' Rascal is a love letter to high-speed 3D platformers like <em>Sonic the Hedgehog</em> with the dynamic interactivity of <em>Super Mario Bros</em>. Strap in for a thrilling ride filled with speed, excitement, and a cast of endearing characters—an experience that’ll delight classic speedster fans, while also introducing newcomers to the genre!"</p>
