<p>New features also get a release date</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>As we approach the one-year anniversary of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/mobile/pokemon_trading_card_game_pocket">Pokémon Trading Card Game Pocket</a>, The Pokémon Company has lifted the lid on a brand new expansion that will be arriving in the app next week.</p>
<p>The "Mega Rising' expansion bursts onto the scene one week today, on <strong>30th October</strong>, and, as the name suggests, it'll bring a Mega Evolution twist to proceedings. Mega Gyarados, Mega Blaziken and Mega Altaria take to the covers of this new set, and all users will receive one of each on launch day <em>for free</em>.</p>
<p>That's to celebrate the app's one-year anniversary, for which TPC has announced new Special Missions, and reissued Special Drop and Wonder Pick events. The "<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/10/pokemon-tcg-pocket-announces-new-and-updated-features-for-first-anniversary">New and Updated</a>" app features that were teased earlier this month will also arrive on 30th October, so keep an eye out for improved Wonder Picks, a new share feature, and an expanded number of tradable cards.</p>
<p>Here's a closer look at some of the chase cards from the new expansion:</p>


<p>While this writer wishes the new releases would slow down a little, we can't imagine that it'll happen any time soon. The Pokémon Company today announced that the app has surpassed 150 million downloads in its first year, which is a <em>crazy</em> number when you think about it. Expect the new expansions to keep on rolling out, we guess.</p>

              <p>It certainly looks like it’s going to be a joke. When you create an extraction shooter, but then theme it around cartoon ducks and give it a spoof name based on one of the most popular examples of the genre, it’s hard not to assume <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3167020/Escape_From_Duckov/"><em>Escape from Duckov</em></a> is just a goof. But I’m here to tell you, nope, this is a solid and astonishingly compelling PvE looter-shooter that deserves every one of its million sales.</p> <p>I’m not a big extraction shooter guy. (These are first- or third-person games that are generally about entering a battlefield and attempting to harvest as much loot and progress as you can, then extracting yourself before either a timer runs out or you get killed.) This high risk/high reward model tends to feel too stressful to me, and never more so than when it’s all about surviving the attacks of an enemy team of real, human players. It’s like a roguelite but with other people laughing at you, and where loss not only means you don’t keep anything you found, but also anything you arrived with. However, it turns out all I needed was for it to be about ducks.</p>

  <p>Inspired by&nbsp;<em>Escape from Tarkov</em> (the lead developer of the five-person Chinese team behind the game told me he’s an avid, hardcore player), but utterly dissimilar in so many important ways, <em>Escape from Duckov</em> strips the formula down to something that feels far more approachable, although just as ruthless. The game is entirely PvE, and played in single-player, but those web-footed CPU enemies aren’t even vaguely friendly. You’re going to die a <em>lot</em>. But importantly, you’re not going to mind nearly as much.</p>

 <p>The game begins with the most delightful character creator, in which you build yourself a duck avatar with a lot more variety than you might imagine that concept could offer. The wide, blank, pupil-less eyes were irresistible to me, but I could have chosen anything from buttons to metallic binocular-like protrusions. You can have regular cartoon duck legs, or the utter abomination that is human feet. And given this is an offline premium game with no mercenary in-game purchases, you can change up your look any time you want. You then arrive in your bunker, a large, mostly empty space, but for your little bedroom off the side. Down here is Jeff, your duck companion who will show you the ropes, set you quests, and guide you through the process of building out your base.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000638622" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000638622"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000638622">© Team Soda / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>To do this, you’re going to need loot, and to get that, you’re going to have to go outside. So originally armed with nothing but a pointy stick, you need to start making tentative ventures into the green and pleasant realm above. It’s just it’s populated by furious birds (and wolves) holding powerful weapons, all determined for unexplained reasons to kill you on sight.</p>

 <p><em>Escape from Duckov</em>‘s greatest trick is just how well it’s designed around welcoming you in. Those early trips can certainly be tricky, but you’ll very quickly be armed (winged?) with a revolver, shooting down opponents (into really quite horrendously gibby goop), and scooping up all the loot from their amusing cooked-carcass remains. You’ll then do all that extraction shooter goodness, like sneaking into abandoned buildings and emptying the cupboards, daring to head a little further each time. The key point is, the game very carefully doesn’t overwhelm you at first, but subtly ramps up those earliest areas once you’re ready to cope. You’re motivated by those early quests, like finding a flat-head screwdriver to fix the local radio tower, but also by that far more powerful drive: revenge. If a group of ducks took you down last time, well, first you’ll want to return to that spot because you’ve got one chance to recover everything you died carrying, but you’ll also want to wipe the smiles off their beaks right away.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000638627" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000638627"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000638627">© Team Soda / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>And then the loop has its webbed claws into you. Soon you’ll be adding new stations to your base, letting you craft better health items, weapons, and various other elements essential for crafting the next thing on the compelling list. And each of those stations have upgrade paths themselves. Friendly ducks you meet will end up moving in to run some stations, such as a gym or a weapon-modification store, each with their own quests to give you. Everything you add adds more, becomes another to-do list of improvements to loot for, and drives you to be ever-more brave on your expeditions.</p>

 <p>Holding you back are two elements: nighttime and the Storm. The former is fairly easily dealt with: you can either brave the far more dangerous world, or just go to bed and wait for morning. The latter happens every few hundred in-game hours, and at first just makes the outside world inaccessible for a while (it’s a good chance to get busywork done, or you can just sleep past it). But only at first, because of course this too is an opportunity for progression as you start to seek out a means to survive the purple mists.</p> <p>That’s the core of why&nbsp;<em>Escape from Duckov</em> is so great, and so successful: it just keeps expanding its scope as you increase your ability to survive, and this loop is so wonderfully compulsive. Of course, this also means that the risk inherent in your run grows so much more, as you head off in your best suit of armor and carrying your finest guns, only to get walloped a few feet from a previously undiscovered extraction point. Then you have to decide, do I risk the exact same super-dangerous run again to recover it all, but this time—you know—without all the equipment you’re trying to rescue? Or do you give it up as heartbreakingly lost, shake it off, and rebuild? (The latter, by the way, is generally the smarter option. I always pick the former.)</p> <figure id="attachment_2000638626" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000638626"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000638626">© Team Soda / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>So for as silly as it looks, and as daftly as it’s named, this isn’t a goof. This is a fantastic and superbly crafted game that continuously draws you further in like falling down a spiral. There’s a really good reason it’s already sold a million copies in its first week since launch. Extraordinarily, for a single-player game, it’s currently the fifth-most played game on Steam, ahead of even&nbsp;<em>Rust</em> and&nbsp;<em>Delta Force</em>, peaking at over a quarter of a million simultaneous players just yesterday. It also has an extraordinary 96-percent positive rating on Steam from nearly 15,000 reviews.</p> <p>And yes, it has me completely hooked. I’m writing this so late in my day because I didn’t want to stop playing and get on with my job. I’m going right back to it now that I’m done. And it’s hard to give a game more credit than that.</p>

<p>During the Fallout Day Showcase, Bethesda Game Studios unveiled a <strong>new trailer for Fallout 4</strong>, ten years after it hit the market in 2015. The trailer, which was kind of better than anything published before the game came out, revealed that an ANNIVERSARY EDITION is coming to the market on November 10.</p>



<p>The Anniversary Edition of Fallout 4 will come with all expansions, plus Creations is being added to the game, bringing a whole host of curated expansions, mods, and other upgrades and changes.</p>



<h2 id="h-fallout-4-anniversary-edition-announced-by-bethesda">Fallout 4: Anniversary Edition Announced by Bethesda</h2>



<p>Today’s Fallout Day bonanza included a stunning announcement: Fallout 4 is coming back with an Anniversary Edition. It has been ten years since the best-selling title dropped, and it’s still one of the most popular Fallout experiences ever made.</p>



<p>The Anniversary Edition comes with all DLCs and expansions released for the game in the years that followed the launch:</p>



<ul>
<li>Vault-Tec Workshop</li>



<li>Far Harbor</li>



<li>Automatron</li>



<li>Nuka-World</li>



<li>Contraptions Workshop</li>



<li>Wasteland Workshop</li>



<li>Vault-Tec Workshop</li>
</ul>



<p>More than 150 Creations will be added to Fallout 4 via the Anniversary Edition, and Bethesda also revealed that the game will feature <strong>unreleased items</strong>, just to keep things feeling fresh. These items will be discoverable through a new menu, added in an upcoming update to Fallout 4 – you won’t need the Anniversary Edition to obtain this content.</p>

                <p>A new advertisement from Razer is making the rounds on TikTok and proving, yet again, that old-fashioned sexism in gaming is alive and well. Though meant to help promote the tech company's noise cancelling headphones, the ad instead reinforces the stereotype that women--who make up <a href="https://www.theesa.com/resources/the-global-power-of-play-report/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">48% of all gamers</a>, by the way--simply can't stop talking.</p><p>Accompanied by the caption "Don't let yapping get in the way of your winning," <a href="https://v45.tiktokcdn-us.com/089da21650d5c53cd0ece9bdffdedac2/68fd05f3/video/tos/useast8/tos-useast8-ve-0068c002-tx2/oEix9o0qfABiQjBlEpAbswEAGiRgfmoBCViIE6/?a=1233&amp;bti=ODszNWYuMDE6&amp;ch=0&amp;cr=3&amp;dr=0&amp;lr=all&amp;cd=0%7C0%7C0%7C&amp;cv=1&amp;br=1858&amp;bt=929&amp;cs=0&amp;ds=3&amp;ft=4KLxRMzm8Zmo0TugXI4jVXOeQpWrKsd.&amp;mime_type=video_mp4&amp;qs=0&amp;rc=M2c5ZjQ8OWg3Omg3aTw7ZUBpMzVyO2s5cmx5NTMzaTczNEBhMi1hXzIwXjExMzFgMzM2YSNxMmxsMmRzYGFhLS1kMTJzcw%3D%3D&amp;vvpl=1&amp;l=202510231716183F8AFA4B6A9D6205A3D7&amp;btag=e000bd000" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">the ad</a> (first noticed by PC Gamer) depicts a man and woman sitting on a couch together. The man, both holding a controller and wearing a headset, awkwardly shuffles as the woman emphatically speaks to him. After a few moments, he decides to activate the headset's Active Noise Cancellation feature. The woman's voice is drowned out, while the text on the video reads: "Active Noise Cancellation: On, Drama: Off." As of October 23, the advertisement is still up on TikTok.</p><p>Considering Razer's history of making <a href="https://www.razer.com/pc/gaming-headsets-and-audio/kraken-kitty-line?srsltid=AfmBOorPF5lRBMw9zdVmy9cmMGcbxDiM02bQkIhk8yRN4bujxcZAvGeP" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">cute accessories geared towards female audiences</a>, the advertisement comes as a bit of a shock. Though the ad might not be intentionally sexist, it plays into long-standing gender roles and is extremely dismissive towards the large population of women who also play video games. Coincidentally, a <a href="https://www.theesa.com/resources/the-global-power-of-play-report/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">recent study</a> by the Entertainment Software Association found there is a "nearly equal gender split" among video game players.</p><p>The response to the ad has been primarily negative, with users writing comments like "welp guess I'm done with razer after 15 years," "I just put my razer headphones in the bin," and "the casual misogyny is INSANE" in response. Per PC Gamer, TikTok users are also taking to other Razer videos to express their discontent, with the top comment on an ad for the company's Razer Kuromi headset reading, "razer's sexist btw."</p><p>GameSpot has reached out to Razer for comment.</p>

                <p>Nintendo has finally shown a bit more of Metroid Prime 4: Beyond, though apparently by accident. Two 15-second commercials for the Switch 2 were found, both unlisted on the Nintendo of America YouTube channel, and one includes a brief glimpse of a boss fight that we haven't seen before. Those hypersensitive to spoilers should turn away.</p><p>Both unlisted videos, uploaded on October 15, are titled "Power Up Your Holidays," with the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2MZEWTy9xpk" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">first video</a> showcasing the previously seen plant-like boss Carvex. But more noteworthy is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0yz3tTS0xPU" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the second video</a>, which emphasizes the Switch 2 version's use of mouse controls and 120fps support, while also giving us our first look at a boss called Xelios. And this boss is spherical!</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=grtEt0Cudt8" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/grtEt0Cudt8" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>We only see it for a few seconds, but Xelios appears to be composed of several hexagonal plates that can shift around, with a green sac and pink core at its center. Presumably, you as Samus Aran will have to blast that pink center to hell whenever this sphere-like boss exposes it.</p><p>With only slivers of information to go on, there aren't too many conclusions about the story and events of Metroid Prime 4 we can make, but the existence of Xelios confirms a couple of trends.</p><p>First, there's a clear naming indication with these bosses, with the early-game enemy Aberax (as seen in the <a href="https://youtu.be/9W9xes7BZto?si=4oERcI-JJq88Ev7d&amp;t=683" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Nintendo Treehouse stream</a>) and the aforementioned Carvex and Xelios. They, along with the main villain Sylux, all have the letter X in their names, not unlike the members of Organization XIII in Kingdom Hearts. Don't expect any crazy crossover, though.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0yz3tTS0xPU" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/0yz3tTS0xPU" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Secondly, footage of the Aberax fight shows the enemy being possessed by a Metroid before it attacks Samus, gaining new abilities and green sacs and pink nuclei similar to those of Metroids. It's possible that the other bosses we've seen are also fused with Metroids. Whatever the case is, it looks like Metroid Prime 4 is heavily emphasizing the "Metroid" part of the title.</p><p>Both commercial videos are still unlisted, but they indicate that Nintendo is priming (pun intended) the game for holiday-season marketing of the Switch 2. Metroid Prime 4: Beyond will be <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/metroid-prime-4-beyond-finally-gets-a-release-date-coming-this-december/1100-6534699/" data-ref-id="1100-6534699">out just in time for the holidays</a> on December 4, but fans eager to digest anything Metroid-related can look forward to the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/metroid-prime-1-3-trilogy-visual-retrospective-book-preorder-metroid-prime-4-beyond-release/1100-6528042/" data-ref-id="1100-6528042">Metroid Prime 1-3 visual retrospective book</a> this month.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>One of the desperate arguments for AI is that it will help people be creative without all the practice and hard work that goes into actually creating something–that, as science fiction writer Ted Chiang wrote at <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/culture/the-weekend-essay/why-ai-isnt-going-to-make-art" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The New Yorker</a> last year, “art can be all inspiration and no perspiration.” A world where whatever enters your head can be immediately externalized is already one of the best reasons for deleting all your social media accounts, but lately we’ve seen politicians use generative AI to show us the unfettered horrors of their brains, and completely remove the wall between them, their cruelty, and the rest of us.</p><p>Donald Trump is of course a <a href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/09/13/ai-is-opening-a-maga-trump-split-00534925" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fan</a>, creating AI videos that <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/01/trump-racist-deepfake-video-jeffries-schumer" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">mock Democratic leaders</a> and, after last weekend’s No Kings protests, depict him <a href="https://www.404media.co/trump-no-kings-ai-poop-jet-video/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">dumping shit</a> on protestors from a fighter jet. Vice President JD Vance called the Democrat videos “funny” and told reporters they would stop if Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer and House minority leader Hakeem Jeffries did what Republicans wanted; <a href="https://thehill.com/homenews/house/5563504-speaker-johnson-trump-no-kings-ai-video/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Speaker Mike Johnson</a> called the plane shit video “satire” and praised Trump for using “social media to make the point. You can argue he’s probably the most effective person who’s ever used social media for that.”</p><p>Lately, NYC mayoral candidate Andrew Cuomo has gotten into the AI game, saying during the first of NYC’s two mayoral debates last week that one his <a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/10/22/nx-s1-5581418/mamdani-cuomo-nyc-mayor" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">takeaways</a> from his rout in the primary was that he “did not do enough on social media” compared to his opponent and front runner <a href="https://aftermath.site/aftermath-hours-podcast-zohran-mamdani-fifa-sim-city" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Zohran Mamdani</a>. On October 1 he released a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nkCgSirfbjc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">partially AI video</a> of himself doing jobs he doesn’t actually do, like window washer and stage hand. This week, he released an utterly bizarre AI-generated smear ad against Mamdani, a riff on <em>Austin Powers’</em> Mini-Me that compares Mamdani to former NYC mayor Bill de Blasio. “There’s no such thing as talent; socialism means we’re all equally dumb!” a squeaky-voiced rendering of Mamdani cheers, while fake de Blasio looks everywhere but at the viewer as if even he knows how dumb this is.</p><p>This ad is off-putting and desperate and dated, but at least its contents just feel like an off-putting and desperate and dated political ad from Cuomo, a man who is himself all of those things. The same can’t be said of another AI video reportedly <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/oct/23/cuomo-zohran-mamdani-ai-ad" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">uploaded and then deleted</a> by the official Cuomo Twitter account during last night’s debate. Shared by Zeteo reporter Prem Thakker, the over two minute video shows various AI-rendered people identifying themselves as “criminals for Zohran” and celebrating the idea that he’ll make their crimes–which include shoplifting, drunk driving, and domestic abuse–legal.&nbsp;</p><p>The video starts with an AI-generated Mamdani frollicking through NYC’s streets and eating rice with his hands, and then continues to be awful: a guy who looks a lot like Idris Elba puts on a medical mask and keffiyeh before shoplifting from a <a href="https://www.vox.com/politics/24025691/shoplifting-scare-criminal-justice-reform" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pharmacy</a>; a cliche 1970s movie pimp stands before a windowless van full of presumably sex-trafficked women. In a nod to equality, I guess, white people are also portrayed as criminals, with an old lady driving around drinking out of a paper bag before crashing her car, and a scene where a woman with a name tag that says “social worker” encourages a man it’s suggested is beating his wife to take deep breaths to “kumbaya the situation.” “Globalize the intifada,” one of Cuomo’s <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/10/22/politics/nyc-mayoral-debate-takeaways" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">favorite phrases</a> to hurl against Mamdani, makes an appearance as pro-Palestinian protestors burn an American flag. Because it’s AI, several of these offensive, NYC scaremongering stereotypes become different people through the course of the ad; the old lady, the pimp, and Idris Elba all look younger at points. But even if AI can’t even give us consistent characters to follow along on their crime sprees, the essential message comes through: New York is full of bad guys, and if Mamdani becomes mayor, those bad guys will burn the city to the ground, as seen in the last shot of the video.</p><p>This would be an appalling ad even if it featured real actors and locations, but I suppose you could argue it would have created some local jobs and thus contributed to the economy Cuomo wants his hands on. But as AI, with all the technology’s wobbles and flaws and weird lighting, it lays bare exactly <a href="https://aftermath.site/how-stupid-do-they-think-we-are" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">how stupid</a> Cuomo thinks voters are–that we are so weak and terrified that we would take this message seriously no matter the grubby package it comes in. This isn’t a surprise coming from the angry, self-righteous man we’ve seen on the campaign trail, one whose supporters considered trying to freak us out with an altered image of <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/12/nyregion/cuomo-mamdani-debate.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mamdani with a thicker beard</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>We already know this about AI, that its boosters think we will guzzle <a href="https://www.theverge.com/ai-artificial-intelligence/762594/fable-showrunner-edwatch-saatchi-interview" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">any slop they feed us</a> simply because <em>they</em> are the ones feeding it to us. But these AI posts reveal less about the general population’s tastes and insecurities than they do the people making them. With AI providing a direct route from Trump and Cuomo’s brains to our screens, we get an unrestricted tour through their heads. They can show us exactly how angry and afraid they are, without even an actor to try to put a spin on it or a local street corner we can recognize. It’s the kind of stuff you could imagine them dumping out in a therapy session with Cuomo’s fake social worker: <em>I am scared everyone is out to get me, I would like to take a big wet crap on people who are mean to me</em>. Fake de Blasio can’t look us in the eye because AI doesn’t understand eye contact, but it also gives Cuomo’s gross fantasy a sense of shame, like some part of him knows these are not the kinds of thoughts you should shout out in public, like he knows these are not the kinds of emotions that should rule a person’s life.&nbsp;</p><p>There’s a sort of intimacy here that could almost be humanizing. The vulnerability in art made by humans can help us understand why people do the bad things they do, but stripped of craft or the self-reflection required to <em>make</em> something, the videos show them as not just vicious but also lazy, like even expressing their deepest insecurities isn’t worth their own time. AI gives us <em>too much</em> intimacy with these men. It gives them the uncut ability not just to externalize their crap in the limited words of Twitter and Truth Social, where a reader would then have to translate it into their own imagination, but in sound and color and the wavering facsimile of humans, the way they must experience their fantasies when they close their eyes and indulge them. They can show us, effortlessly, exactly what they see in their heads, without anything to get between us and their thoughts. We can live in their brains with all the vivid, inescapable impact that they want to bring to bear on the real world. </p><p>Using AI isn’t just a quick way for them to make their videos. It’s another expression of the power they have, and what they’ve turned power into: not just the freedom to shape laws or economics to their desires, but the freedom to be easily and unreservedly their worst selves at all times and make the rest of us live with it. This is in line with the whole AI industry, which is getting<a href="https://www.bloodinthemachine.com/p/how-big-tech-is-force-feeding-us" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> forced into our lives</a> whether we want it or not. AI has long stopped being about human welfare or whatever <a href="https://ia.samaltman.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">lofty bullshit</a> its creators once claimed to believe, and more about keeping its own <a href="https://www.wheresyoured.at/longcon/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">expensive con</a> running at all costs. Men like Trump and Cuomo, as hollow and clumsy and selfish as the things AI spits out, are right at home in it.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/twitch-twitchcon-2025-security-emiru-assault-irl-streamers"><h3>Beefed Up TwitchCon Security Couldn’t Stop The Internet’s Issues From Spilling Over Into Real Life</h3></a><p>A high-profile assault and toxic IRL streamers have forced the Twitch community to reckon with deeper-seated problems</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/criterion-mobile-closet-picks-peter-decker-interview-chicago-international-film-festival"><h3>Criterion’s Mobile Closet Wasn’t About The Van—It Was About IRL Friendships We Made Along The (Five-Hour) Way</h3></a><p>Criterion president Peter Becker reflects on how Closet Picks evolved from a spontaneous idea into a beloved ritual among cinephiles for its 40th anniversary roadshow celebration.</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/bluesky-resistance-bots"><h3>Why Are My Bluesky Bots So Into Irish</h3></a><p>If I have to have uncomfortable social interactions, they should at least be with real people</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div><br/><br/>https://aftermath.site/ai-trump-cuomo]]></content:encoded>

<p>Sneaky...</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Nintendo and Ubisoft have finally confirmed the world's worst-kept secret: <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/assassins-creed-shadows">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> is launching on the Switch 2 on 2nd December 2025. Darn, that is a <em>packed</em> first week of the last month of 2025, isn't it?</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/10/assassins-creed-shadows-switch-2-rating-spotted-online">Rumours have</a> been <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/10/rumour-assassins-creed-shadows-on-switch-2-may-clash-with-metroid-prime-4">swirling about</a> this one for a few weeks now, but the announcement confirms a couple of rather lovely features. It'll cost <strong>USD</strong> <strong>$59.99</strong> and will be available on the eShop or as a Game-Key Card.</p>
<p>First up, cross-progression is available as long as you have an Ubisoft Connect account! So if you've been playing on another console up until now and want to swap to the hybrid system for the holiday season, you won't lose your progress.</p>
<p>Secondly, here's something we didn't expect: touchscreen support. All the in-game menus will allow you to use the touchscreen when playing in handheld mode. That includes the world map, too.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/game/assassins-creed/news/6RbmYrpsP24PJYtPlpJ2mX/assassins-creed-shadows-fall-roadmap-update">a blog post</a>, Ubisoft has also detailed Title Updates 10 and 11 for the game. Those updates will be available on the Switch 2 version from release, and these bring Corrupted Castles, parkour updates, new free story updates, and new environmental puzzles. Note that the Claws of Awaji expansion won't be available until early 2026.</p>
<p>For those who missed it earlier in the year, Assassin's Creed Shadows launched on other consoles on 20th March 2025. Taking the series to Feudal Japan, you play as both the shinobi Naoe or the samurai Yasuke, both of whom play very differently. Naoe feels like your more traditional series protagonist, focusing on stealthy gameplay, while Yasuke is much more direct in combat.</p>
<p>Our sister site Push Square were fans upon its original release, awarding the game <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/reviews/ps5/assassins-creed-shadows">an 8/10</a>, concluding:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"While Assassin's Creed Shadows is unlikely to win over those who struggled to push through Odyssey or Valhalla, this is still one of the strongest overall entries in the series — and arguably the best of the open world RPG bunch."</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>South Korean publisher WEMADE MAX and developer MADNGINE have unveiled a new open world action RPG called Project TAL with a stunning trailer. </p>



<p>In this single player game, which is currently scheduled to arrive on PC and consoles in 2027, players will explore a reimagining of Korea's traditional Tal masks and the mythology and folklore surrounding them. Project TAL features cinematic and fast-paced combat where players can leap onto massive monsters to deliver powerful attacks, exploit enemy weak spots, and perform tactical counterattacks and skill combos.</p>



<p>One of the game's core features is a companion system that responds dynamically to the player’s combat style and the environment. Each NPC companion featured in the game has unique abilities, personalities and combat roles ranging from defence and support to melee, ranged and magic. Players will experience seamless moments of cooperation in Project TAL, such as catching a falling companion in the heat of battle or witnessing a support companion deploy a magical barrier to deflect enemy attacks away from the party.</p>



<p>Sohn Myun-seok, CEO of WEMADE MAX, stated:</p>



<p><em>Project TAL combines an emotionally resonant story about healing a wounded world with the exhilarating combat of a classic action RPG. With MADNGINE’s technical expertise and artistic vision, we’re creating a AAA open-world title built to compete on a global stage.</em></p>

</p></figure>



<p>WEMADE MAX and MADNGINE previously worked together on the MMORPG Night Crows, which launched in Korea in 2023 and globally last year. However, Project TAL is a far cry from it, being a single player action-oriented roleplaying game for PC and consoles, whereas Night Crows is an MMORPG for PC and mobile with blockchain-powered play-to-earn features.</p>



<p>According to the press release, MADNGINE has recently established a 'multi-production creative structure' to develop multiple new franchises, such as Project TAL. Going forward, it will focus on high-end genres, platform diversity and technological scalability.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/assassin%E2%80%99s-creed-shadows-looks-like-another-impressive-switch-2-port-from-ubisoft.1333027/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>One of the worst-kept secrets of 2025 has finally been officially announced by Ubisoft.<a href="https://kotaku.com/games/assassins-creed-shadows"><em> Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em></a>, the latest entry in the publisher’s sneaky-stabby series of open-world games, is getting a Switch 2 port later this year.</p> <p>On October 23, <a href="https://youtu.be/OzyD_EFZzgc">Ubisoft officially revealed</a> that <em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em> is coming to the Nintendo Switch 2 on December 2. This version of the game will support full cross progression across all platforms and will also feature touchscreen support for all in-game menus, though you’ll be able to use a controller, too. The recently released expansion for <em>AC Shadows</em>, <em>Claws of Awaji</em>, won’t be available for Switch 2 players until “early next year.”</p>

 <p>Here’s the first trailer for the Switch 2 port of <em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows,</em> which appears to show a seemingly impressive-looking port of the massive and <a href="https://kotaku.com/assassins-creed-shadows-graphics-seasons-screenshots-1851770252">gorgeous open-world game</a> set in feudal Japan.</p>  <p>“We are delighted to bring <em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em> to Nintendo players,” said <em>AC Shadows</em> director Charles Benoit in a press release announcing the port. “Whether slipping through the shadows as Naoe or facing foes head-on as Yasuke, players will be able to roam the streets and rooftops of feudal Japan at home or anywhere their journey takes them on Nintendo Switch 2.”</p>

 <p>Ubisoft’s incredible-looking and playing <a href="https://kotaku.com/star-wars-outlaws-switch-2-port-patch-is-it-good-2000624465">Switch 2 port of<em> Star Wars Outlaws</em> earlier this year</a> showed that the company can bring its high-end blockbusters to Nintendo’s less-powerful hardware while still making sure the games look great. And this first trailer for <em>Shadows</em> running on Switch 2 looks equally impressive, with lots of detail and realistic lighting. Sure, it’s not as sharp as <em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em> running on a PS5 Pro connected to a 4K TV, but I bet it will look fine on the Switch 2’s smaller screen.</p> <p>Of course, <em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em> arriving on Switch 2 isn’t exactly a surprise. <a href="https://kotaku.com/assassins-creed-shadows-switch-2-preorder-release-date-2000634141">The game was leaked earlier this month</a> following months of rumors. Still, it’s nice to have it officially announced, and it’s great that more people will have a chance to check out what I think is one of Ubisoft’s best games in a long time.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Even in a packed year for kart racers, <a href="https://kotaku.com/kirby-air-riders-switch-2-release-date-nintendo-direct-trailer-2000618410"><em>Kirby Air Riders</em></a> is playing for keeps. Will it earn a place alongside <a href="https://kotaku.com/mario-kart-world-free-roam-open-world-burnout-paradise-1851776569"><em>Mario Kart World</em></a> and <a href="https://kotaku.com/sonic-racing-crossworlds-crossover-review-hatsune-miku-2000626583"><em>Sonic Racing: Crossworlds</em></a>? Director Masahiro Sakurai hopes so. The legendary developer said he doesn’t plan on continuing the series; the upcoming Switch 2 exclusive is a one-and-done. “I’ve thrown everything I have into this game,” he said during its latest livestream preview. He certainly has. Just when you thought you knew everything<em> Kirby Air Riders</em> has to offer, Sakurai announces even more modes, characters, and features, including a roguelike adventure called Road Trip.</p> <p>In a second hour-long <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZHYjYHHiBM">Direct-style presentation for <em>Kirby Air Riders</em></a> that went live on Thursday, the famed<em> Smash Bros. Ultimate</em> director reminded fans why he’s the king of content maximalism. If you thought Nintendo’s latest racing game, out November 20, would be just a racing game with a sandbox mode, you would be sorely mistaken, my pink, puffy friend. Some are already calling it the “<a href="https://x.com/TAHK0/status/1981361888173969671">Kirby game of all Kirby games</a>.”</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Sorry to break the order of my reporting of the Kirby Air Riders Direct, but I needed to share Sakurai's closing speech because what a guy! He is a masterclass in game development. <a href="https://t.co/ngXoBgcj4X">pic.twitter.com/ngXoBgcj4X</a></p> <p>— Kābī (@KirPinkFury) <a href="https://twitter.com/KirPinkFury/status/1981362564576551304?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 23, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>This is far from the full list of newly revealed features players will get to mess around with:</p> <ul> <li>Top-down camera view race mode called Top Ride</li> <li>Roguelike mode with random challenges from other modes and unique story beats called Road Trip</li> <li>Match lobby called Paddock where you can interact and move between different online races</li> <li>Variant of Air Ride called Swap Relay where you change machines every lap</li> <li>Machine that can switch configurations called Transform Star</li> <li>Set of achievements called Checklist that lets you chase unlockables throughout the game</li> <li>Global Win Power shows how many times you’ve won in addition to your online class ranking</li> <li>Custom licenses to show off your personality online</li> <li>Boss battles</li> <li>Expanded roster including the spider Taranza, wily duo Lololo &amp; Lalala, the bug-eyed Marx, and others</li> </ul> <h2><em>Kirby Air Riders</em> feels like a direct attack on <em>Mario Kart World</em></h2> <p>Like I said, this is an incomplete and abridged rundown of all of the gameplay elements Sakurai dove into during the latest and likely final preview of <em>Kirby Air Riders</em> ahead of release. He also mentioned how players will earn miles by playing that are spent to unlock more parts of the Machine Market to outfit your ride. Plus there are new collectibles called Gummies. They sound a bit like the stickers from <em>Smash Bros. Ultimate</em>. “Who knows, maybe you’ll become a Gummillionaire!” Nintendo’s words, not mine.</p>

 <p>But wait, there’s still more! <em>Kibry Air Riders</em> is also getting dedicated amiibo figures. There are three, all launching next year starting on March 5 with Meta Knight &amp; Shadow Star, followed later on by King Dedede &amp; Tank Star and Chef Kawasaki &amp; Hop Star. Like the new amiibo Nintendo’s been rolling out, these are bigger, more complex, and will likely have those bigger $30 price tags to match. Has Nintendo given Sakurai a blank check to do whatever he wants with <em>Kirby Air Riders</em> before he makes the next <em>Smash Bros.</em>? Probably.</p> <p>We’ll see how it all adds up in practice, but on paper at least, the game is certainly shaping up to satiate even the most ravenous fans’ demands in a way the somewhat content-lite <em>Mario Kart World</em> maybe didn’t when it debuted back over the summer. “Just so you know, we’re not planning DLC, everything is here,” Sakurai said of <em>Kirby Air Riders</em>. Ouch! Switch Online subscribers can try the game for free during Global Test Ride events on Nov. 8-9 and Nov. 15-16.</p>

Digital items like gloves and knives go for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/counter-strike-skin-sells-for-160000-or-around-320-ps5-consoles/1100-6512356/" data-ref-id="1100-6512356">thousands</a>--if not <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/counter-strike-skin-sells-for-over-1-million" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">millions</a>--of dollars, but all of that changed within the last few hours as a new update completely wiped out roughly $1.75 billion in value.</p><p>According to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-10-23/market-for-counter-strike-items-falls-1-75-billion-overnight?srnd=undefined" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">a new Bloomberg report</a>, in-game CS items ranging from guns to knives to gloves fell 25% between Wednesday, October 22, and Thursday, October 23. In these two days, developer Valve Corporation pushed out an update for the shooter that altered the exchange rates of these items. Immediately following this update, the prices for these items tanked, with market analytics company Pricempire estimating the losses in the billions. Ethan MacDonald, the company's marketing manager, told Bloomberg that he was stunned by the change.</p>

<p>"This was a complete shock to the community," he said. "This completely changes the supply of Counter-Strike's most sought-after and expensive tier of items."</p><p>A huge number of players have been affected by this update. One 20-something trader Bloomberg spoke with had $1 million of digital items in his inventory on Wednesday, but by Thursday, he had lost upwards of $270,000. Chinese players, who Bloomberg noted are some of the game's primary traders, criticized the price shift on the ByteDance-owned, short-form video platform Douyin. This all led MacDonald to believe the "bubble" had burst.</p><p>In other Counter-Strike news, a troupe of modders announced a remake of the 1.6 version of the game called <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/modders-announce-cs-legacy-a-standalone-counter-strike-1-6-remake/1100-6530176/" data-ref-id="1100-6530176">Counter-Strike: Legacy</a>.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/mini-review-silver-bullet-switch-a-gothic-arcade-shooter-full-of-tricks.1332994/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/silver_bullet">Silver Bullet</a>’s aesthetic is dark, cartoony, and full of Halloween charm. But beneath its playful premise of a pint-sized Van Helsing rescuing puppies from the forces of darkness lies a razor-blade-stuffed apple - an arcade game with a wicked edge.</p>
<p>Mashing genres into something unique, its crosshair shooting setup is reminiscent of Cabal or Wild Guns, but eradicates ambiguous pseudo-3D trajectories by flattening everything onto a pure 2D plane. You trace your crosshair about the screen to gun down ghouls and dash to avoid bullets, while giant bosses - everything from fiery skeletons to undead dinosaurs - rain down fun and fearsome bullet hell-style patterns that are both inventive and thrilling to work through.</p>
<p>Helsing has a regularly refilled super attack that can be aimed and fired in a straight line, bleeding point icons as it wipes out enemies, and a close-encounters button-tap parry for expert use. His dash manoeuvre can also destroy enemies and certain obstacles, essential for tidying cluttered screens.</p>
<p>The goal is simple: don’t die and make your super shots count. Fine-tuned for scoring, each stage is plumbed with tricks to propel you up the leaderboards, with an accuracy meter that rises when hitting an object, multiplying your points, and falling when firing on dead air. A death, however, cuts this right down. Coins can be teased from each stage to be spent in a shop, doubling your super usage and improving accuracy, amongst other effects, implemented to incrementally improve your chances.</p>
<p>There are six stages and six interim, viciously creative bonus games that are frankly very tough to crack, borrowing ideas from Namco’s <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps1/point_blank">Point Blank</a> and Capcom’s <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/arcade/pang">Pang</a>, amongst others. There’s a challenging score attack mode and a novel <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gameboy/tetris">Tetris</a> shooting-hybrid called Terror Blocks to unlock, with a unique scoring system all its own.</p>
<p>If you don’t care about points, continues are freely available to get you through the game. At only 35 minutes in length, however, Silver Bullet shines brightest when you attempt a one-credit clear, and it's meticulously engineered around this. Extra lives appear at certain waypoints, and pocketing coins to rapidly empty the shop is a smart approach. Challenging though it is, the reward for success is all the more elating. This is owed largely to a clever arrangement that, once understood, keeps drawing you back for another go.</p>
<p>Yet, there are a few frustrations. It's occasionally difficult to discern which objects you can safely dash through, and positioning with walk or dash isn't entirely foolproof. Silver Bullet’s most prominent foible, though, is its control dilemma. Designed around a twin-stick setup - one for Helsing’s movement and the other for crosshair positioning - it's awkward to have button work restricted to the shoulders and triggers. Switching to traditional controls is far more comfortable, but then you can’t move the crosshair independently unless you’re firing at the same time. This negatively impacts your accuracy and, in turn, your scoring.</p>
<p>It’s not a colossal problem, and casual gamers will have a great time with its cleverly devised stages, but those aiming to play as intended face a tough choice: master the twin-stick controls or accept reduced scoring potential in favour of a more intuitive experience. It's a thorny choice, but regardless of how you choose to play, Silver Bullet is a bewitchingly fun little Halloween title that will have arcade enthusiasts howling at the moon.</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/silver-bullet]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii%E2%80%99s-final-story-dlc-is-out-on-november-11.1332991/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Today, publisher Plaion and developer Warhorse Studios announced that the final story DLC planned for Kingdom Come: Deliverance II, titled Mysteria Ecclesiae, will be released on November 11.</p>



<p>In this expansion pack, Henry, the game's main character, becomes Sigismund Albicus's assistant. Albicus is a renowned healer with ties to King Wenceslas himself. Henry is tasked with a clandestine mission within the monastery's ancient walls and finds himself entangled in a web of intrigue and a deadly, mysterious plague, where each faction harbours its own hidden motives.</p>



<p>Kingdom Come: Deliverance II players can explore the fascinating Sedletz Monastery and meet its elusive inhabitants. A sudden epidemic has hit the area, and it is imperative to discover its origin. Warhorse promises a rich, cinematic quest that will test the player's deductive and sleuthing skills.</p>



<p>Unraveling the secrets of Sedletz Monastery will require interacting with its inhabitants and discovering their hidden agendas. They will engage with various factions, each with its own motivations, and shape the course of events with their decisions. Players will traverse the diverse areas of the historically accurate Sedletz Monastery, gradually unlocking new sections as they solve mysteries and uncover hidden secrets. As you would expect from such a DLC, the developers have introduced new outfits, weapons, potions and books to expand Henry's knowledge and abilities.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Mysteria Ecclesiae can be purchased at $13.99 on its own, or as part of the Expansion Pass, which is priced at $29.99. That also includes the other two previously released story DLCs, <a href="https://wccftech.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-brushes-with-death-story-dlc-out-now-on-all-platforms/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Brushes with Death</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-legacy-of-the-forge-dlc-update-14/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Legacy of the Forge</a>. Kingdom Come: Deliverance II Gold Edition owners will get Mysteria Ecclesiae automatically, since the Gold Edition includes the Expansion Pass.</p>



<p>Kingdom Come: Deliverance II has been a great success for both Plaion and Warhorse Studios, having sold over three million units to date. The game also received outstanding acclaim from critics, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">including a perfect score from Wccftech's Chris Wray</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer Warhorse Studios and publisher Deep Silver have announced the final&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance II&nbsp;</em>story DLC, and it'll take Henry to a plague-stricken monastery to investigate the deadly disease's origin next month.</p>

<p>Per a press release,&nbsp;<em>Mysteria Ecclesiae&nbsp;</em>will serve as the celebrated medieval RPG's last major expansion, and it's set for release across all platforms on November 11th.</p>

<p>In&nbsp;<em>Mysteria Ecclesiae</em>, you'll serve as the assistant to renowned healer Sigismund Albicus, and together with that venerated figure, you'll be investigating the Sedletz Monastery, where "a web of intrigue and a deadly, mysterious plague" await you, as well as factions with their own "hidden motives".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii-final-dlc-monastery.jpg?itok=dXRM_Tco 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii-final-dlc-monastery.jpg?itok=HRYkLbut 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance II&nbsp;</em>is getting one final story DLC next month.</figcaption></figure><p>As you'd probably expect from&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance II</em>, the Sedletz Monastery will be a "historically accurate" area in which you can expect "diverse areas" to explore, as well as "hidden secrets" to uncover.</p>

<p>Naturally, you'll also be able to take advantage of a brand new outfit for Henry, as well as new weapons, potions, and books to help you "expand [your] knowledge and abilities to new horizons". In short, if you loved the base game, it'll almost certainly be worth checking this DLC out.</p>

<p>If you're unfamiliar with&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance II</em>, it's the sequel to the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/kingdom-come-deliverance-sales-8m" rel="nofollow">hugely successful</a> 2018 action RPG&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance</em>, and like its predecessor, the sequel emphasizes historical realism and accuracy over fantasy elements.</p>

<p>You'll once again take the role of Henry of Skalitz as he sets out on a journey to avenge the murder of his parents, and along the way, you'll discover plenty of medieval court intrigue to get wrapped up in.</p>




<p><em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance II&nbsp;</em>is no slouch in the sales department either; at last count, the game had managed to rack up <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-sales-3m" rel="nofollow">three million sales for itself</a>, and it's almost certainly topped that figure by now as well.</p>

<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance II</em>'s&nbsp;<em>Mysteria Ecclesiae&nbsp;</em>expansion when it launches on November 11th. The game itself is available right now for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1771300/Kingdom_Come_Deliverance_II/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii/9N4W31HSMVVD" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>, and you can read our review <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii-review-deliciously-executed-revenge" rel="nofollow">right here</a>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Elden Ring Switch 2 Version Delayed for "Performance Adjustments"]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-switch-2-delayed-2026</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/elden-ring-switch-2-version-delayed-for-performance-adjustments.1332985/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer FromSoftware and publisher Bandai Namco have announced that the upcoming Switch 2 version of celebrated open-world action RPG&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring&nbsp;</em>has been delayed into next year.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/ELDENRING/status/1981360180580217143" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">message</a> on social media, the two studios say that while development on the game's Switch 2 port "continues wholeheartedly towards release", a delay is necessary in order for the developers to implement "performance adjustments".</p>

<p>No new release date has been given; all we know is that&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring: Tarnished Edition</em>, for 'tis its name, is now due to arrive on Nintendo's new console sometime in 2026.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/elden-ring-switch-2-delayed-margit.jpg?itok=ggS7d90b 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/elden-ring-switch-2-delayed-margit.jpg?itok=7L1R1DRX 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Elden Ring&nbsp;</em>won't be hitting the Switch 2 this year.</figcaption></figure><p>News of&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring</em>'s delay on Switch 2 follows reports that the game's performance on the console was lackluster, to say the least; during a hands-on at Gamescom, IGN <a href="https://www.ign.com/videos/elden-ring-on-switch-2-is-a-disaster-in-handheld-mode-gamescom-2025" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">described</a>&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring</em>'s Switch 2 handheld performance as "a disaster".</p>

<p>The publication said that frame drops were "significant" when turning the camera outside of the game's initial tutorial area, and that the Switch 2 version of&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring&nbsp;</em>also sported a "confusing button layout", which is odd considering the console's controller setup is pretty much the same as any other.</p>

<p>IGN didn't say anything about&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring</em>'s docked performance on Switch 2, but it presumably won't fare much better than the handheld version, so hopefully, this extra time gives FromSoftware and Bandai Namco time to polish up&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring&nbsp;</em>on Nintendo's new machine before release.</p>

<p>When it does eventually launch,&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring: Tarnished Edition&nbsp;</em>will bring the full game experience to Switch 2, including last year's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/elden-ring-shadow-of-erdtree" rel="nofollow">excellent</a>&nbsp;<em>Shadow of the Erdtree&nbsp;</em>DLC and all updates that have been released since the game's initial 2022 launch.</p>




<p>You'll be able to check out&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring: Tarnished Edition&nbsp;</em>when it launches sometime next year on Switch 2, and the game is also currently available on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1245620/ELDEN_RING/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/elden-ring/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/elden-ring/9P3J32CTXLRZ/0010" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox</a> (albeit with the DLC sold separately).</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The Pokemon Company has announced&nbsp;<em>Mega Rising</em>, the latest expansion for the mobile smash hit&nbsp;<em>Pokemon TCG Pocket</em>, and it's due to bring a game-changing new set of 'mons to the digital card game next week.</p>

<p>Launching on October 29th,&nbsp;<em>Mega Rising&nbsp;</em>makes good on a promise made by The Pokemon Company <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-tcg-pocket-mega-evolution-fall" rel="nofollow">back in August</a>&nbsp;by introducing Mega Evolved Pokemon into the mix. As you'd imagine, these are powerful cards, but they come with risks, too.</p>

<p>Mega Evolved Pokemon will have higher stats and attack power than regular creatures, but if you manage to knock them out, you'll win three whole points for yourself. That's right; defeating a Mega Evolved Pokemon wins you the match, regardless of where things currently stand.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pokemon-tcg-pocket-mega-rising-cards.jpg?itok=AOziJHCb 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pokemon-tcg-pocket-mega-rising-cards.jpg?itok=G8yqf7Kh 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Pokemon TCG Pocket</em>'s new&nbsp;<em>Mega Rising&nbsp;</em>expansion has plenty of Mega Evolved cards for you to admire.</figcaption></figure><p>Of course, just like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-tcg-pocket-wisdom-of-sea-and-sky-expansion" rel="nofollow">previous</a>&nbsp;<em>Pokemon TCG Pocket&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-tcg-pocket-expansion-shining-revelry" rel="nofollow">expansions</a>, you can expect a bevy of new cards to collect and admire in&nbsp;<em>Mega Rising&nbsp;</em>as well, and some of the artwork for these cards is truly jaw-dropping. Here's hoping its <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-tcg-pocket-ho-oh-production-issue-plagiarism" rel="nofollow">provenance is legit this time</a>, eh?</p>

<p>Mega Evolved 'mons include the likes of Blaziken, Gyarados, and Altaria, and you can also expect new art for existing Pokemon like Pidgey, Growlithe, and Jirachi, among others. It's a real smorgasbord of beautiful Pokemon drawings.</p>

<p>Not only that, but you can also look forward to accessories based on Mega Blaziken, which will be available starting from October 31st to give you the opportunity to "make your hottest cards look even more scorching".</p>

<p>You can take a look at the (appropriately epic) announcement trailer for&nbsp;<em>Pokemon TCG Pocket</em>'s&nbsp;<em>Mega Rising&nbsp;</em>expansion, which shows off some of the expansion's beautiful artwork and new cards, right here.</p>




<p>You'll be able to check out&nbsp;<em>Pokemon TCG Pocket</em>'s&nbsp;<em>Mega Rising&nbsp;</em>expansion when it launches on October 29th. The game is available to play for free right now on <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=jp.pokemon.pokemontcgp&amp;hl=en_GB" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Android</a> and <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/pok%C3%A9mon-tcg-pocket/id6479970832" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">iOS</a>.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/microsoft-xbox-profit-margins-30-percent-report</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/microsoft-reportedly-pushing-xbox-to-hit-sky-high-30-profit-margins.1332976/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Xbox is reportedly being pushed by parent company Microsoft to achieve profit margins far in excess of those towards which the rest of the industry aims, according to a new report.</p>

<p>As reported by <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-10-23/microsoft-pushes-xbox-studios-to-hit-higher-profit-margins" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Bloomberg</a> (which, of course, cites "people familiar with the business"), Microsoft has set goals of 30% for Xbox's "accountability margins", which is apparently the term Microsoft uses instead of "profit margins". Start brushing up on those corpo-jargon dictionaries now.</p>

<p>Bloomberg reports that average industry profit margins sit between 17% and 22%. Xbox's have generally been lower than that over the past few years at between 10% and 20%, so this 30% profit goal is a massive jump even for Xbox, let alone for the rest of the industry.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-outer-worlds-2-xbox-profit-report.jpg?itok=q8T0vi_o 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-outer-worlds-2-xbox-profit-report.jpg?itok=fzU76ZfK 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Xbox is reportedly being pushed to hit 30% profit margins by overlo-er, parent company Microsoft.</figcaption></figure><p>S&amp;P Global analyst Neil Barbour told Bloomberg that the 30% target is one "usually reserved for a publisher that is really nailing it". Given the controversy surrounding <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xbox-game-pass-tiers-reworked-2025" rel="nofollow">recent Game Pass changes</a>, as well as <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/everwild-canceled-rare-layoffs-report" rel="nofollow">project cancellations</a> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/latest-microsoft-layoff-wave-king-zenimax" rel="nofollow">layoffs</a>, I'd say you'd struggle to apply that descriptor to Xbox right now.</p>

<p>Speaking of Game Pass, Bloomberg's sources say that Xbox's requirement for all first-party games to launch on Game Pass on day one "has hurt Xbox game sales".</p>

<p>According to Bloomberg, Xbox offers a developer incentive that is calculated based on "several factors", one of which is the number of hours players spend on Game Pass titles. Naturally, that means these rewards will be given more often to developers of live-service titles or those without finite campaigns.</p>

<p>In previous years, Xbox staff weren't given specific numerical figures as profit goals; this change, according to Bloomberg, came in 2023 and was introduced by CFO Amy Hood, who's been taking "a larger role in the gaming business" alongside her team recently.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/xbox-game-pass-xbox-profit-margin-report.jpg?itok=N5fYh_Q6 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/xbox-game-pass-xbox-profit-margin-report.jpg?itok=RUcgzQTr 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Game Pass apparently continues to cause problems for Xbox developers.</figcaption></figure><p>This isn't the first time we've heard of Game Pass reportedly causing problems for developers and Xbox insiders. Back in September, former Xbox VP Shannon Loftis said the service <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xbox-game-pass-shannon-loftis-comments" rel="nofollow">creates "weird inner tensions" among developers</a>, with Game Pass adoption coming "at the expense of retail revenue".</p>

<p>It's not hard to see how that might make hitting the aforementioned 30% profit margin difficult, and if Bloomberg's report is to be believed, the publisher is still being expected to hit this target even when taking day one Game Pass games into account.</p>

<p>If it's accurate, the 30% profit margin figure might explain some of Xbox's recent moves, including hiking the price of Game Pass, cancelling projects left and right, and shutting down studios.</p>

<p>For its own part, Xbox told Bloomberg that success "doesn't look the same across every project", and that the company sometimes has to make "hard decisions" while "shifting resources towards the projects that are more aligned with [its] direction and priorities".</p>

It looks easy enough, but those concerned with aesthetics may be disappointed to see that one version of the cartridge module does appear to stick out of the back of the Lego Game Boy because it houses a pair of AAA batteries.</p><p>The BrickBoy will be <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/brickboy/brickboy-the-kit-that-makes-the-lego-game-boy-come-alive">available for preorder through a Kickstarter crowdfunding campaign</a> that’s set to launch on October 28th, 2025, in three versions. The Essential Kit can play Game Boy games in grayscale and includes a mono speaker, while the Gamer Kit adds support for Game Boy Color and Game Boy Advance titles, Bluetooth headphone connectivity, and a rechargeable battery.

            <link>https://kotaku.com/this-50-fire-tv-comes-with-a-soundbar-and-is-160-off-2000637805</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>If you’re kicking yourself still for not jumping on any of the deals from a couple weeks ago over at Amazon for Prime Big Deals Day, something wonderful just dropped into your lap. Right now, Amazon has one of its Fire TVs on sale for 31% off. And this isn’t a Fire TV Stick, this is a full 50-inch TV with a Fire TV interface.<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4953/"> That discount brings the price down from $520 to just $360, saving you a whole $160</a>. <strong>If that’s not enough to get you excited, it also includes a free Fire TV Soundbar.</strong> Those start around at least $100 and it’s bundled here for no extra charge.</p>
<p>The Amazon smart TV measures across at 50-inches making for a pretty sizable display for a living room, den, or any shared space really. This is the 4-series model from 2024. It supports vivid 4K entertainment withy HDR10, HLG, and Dolby Digital Plus which all work together to make an impressive picture for your enjoyment with clear clarity and bright colors.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4953/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>As an Amazon smart TV, this comes with an Alexa-enabled remote. The Alexa remote is a complete gamechanger when it comes to browsing for content. Those on-screen keypads can be so cumbersome to type on. Every app lays them out differently, with some being in alphabetical order and others following the popularized QWERTY layout. And all you have in the little directional pad to hop over one letter at a time. That can take forever to type out a long title like “<em>Only Murders in the Building</em>.” Sweat not, because with the Alexa remote, you can just hold the button and speak the title aloud, then be brought right to it.</p>



<h2>Fire TV Soundbar Included</h2>
<p>TV speakers have gotten better and better over the years, but they’re still no comparison to a dedicated surround sound system or sound bar. What a treat it is that this TV comes with its own soundbar free of charge. This can be set right in front of your TV on top of your media center so you can enjoy rich, three-dimensional virtual surround sound. It supports DTS Virtual:X and even more detail with Dolby Audio. It’s easy to set up too. Just plug it into the TV with the included HDMI cable to the HDMI eARC/ARC on the TV. Presto, now the soundbar will work just like that.</p>
<p>The TV has three additional HDMI ports along with that HDMI eARC/ARC port so you can connect to a cable box or multiple gaming consoles if you wish.</p>
