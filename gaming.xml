              <p>The thing that surprises me most about these personal GOTY lists, which I’ve been doing most years since I started working at <em>Kotaku</em> (including in the <a href="https://kotaku.com/best-games-2023-zelda-cyberpunk-baldur-s-gate-3-a-1851130971">delivery room for my third child</a>), is just how little I remember them after they go up. I could guess what was on the <a href="https://kotaku.com/ethan-gach-s-top-10-games-of-2020-1845962135">2020 list</a>, or the <a href="https://kotaku.com/ethan-gachs-top-10-games-of-2018-1831323132">2018 one</a>, or my very first one from 2016, but I would probably get half of them wrong.</p> <p>The dirty little secret about these lists, at least for me, is how fluid and ephemeral they are. What was in my top 10 shifted throughout the year and that variance didn’t stop once the list was published. I lock in my choice but always harbor doubts, not just about the games themselves but most of all about my own ambivalent feelings toward them. Those change, evolve, and usually just get more complicated over time.</p>

 <p>Each of those lists would probably be different if I compiled them today. But that’s sort of the point. They are snapshots of what I thought I felt at the time. Maybe they help, even if only slightly, to clarify someone else’s feelings about one of their favorite games of the year. Or, even better, turn them onto something they hadn’t already tried. I know, though, that mostly we all just skim the lists to see how much they overlap with our own, and what we think that says about our own tastes and the other person’s. So if you haven’t already skipped ahead, here are my top games of 2025 in alphabetical order:</p>

 <h2><em>9 Kings</em></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000656028" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000656028"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000656028">Sad Socket</figcaption></figure> <p>A beautifully elegant mash-up of minimalist tower defense strategy and roguelike deckbuilding, <em>9 Kings</em> is still in Early Access and already pretty much everything I want it to be. The introduction of a quest mode late in the year basically added an entire second game. Nothing brought me more joy this year than snuggling up on the couch and watching my brain-dead synergies scale in unexpectedly deadly ways.</p>

 <h2><em>Arc Raiders</em></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000655381" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000655381"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000655381">Embark Studios</figcaption></figure> <p>This is the first modern game to get me to break my “no mic with randos” rule. But <em>Arc Raiders</em>‘ real trick is just how rewarding it makes playing the multiplayer extraction format as a solo outsider. It does a wonderful job of blending immersive PVE encounters with unpredictable PVP run-ins in a way that adds to the richness of the sci-fi world rather than making it feel like a series of incentive-driven hamster wheels. Solid gunplay, great atmosphere, rewarding progression.</p>

 <h2><em>Citizen Sleeper 2</em></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000017750" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000017750"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000017750">Jump Over The Age</figcaption></figure> <p><em>Citizen Sleeper 2</em>, a tight-knit sci-fi TTRPG, feels practically sprawling compared to the first game. That scope can occasionally get unwieldy or see the game run into pacing issues, but the fusion of dice-roll skill checks and light resource management with branching dialogue and player choice yields an unforgettably grim but evocative voyage through cosmic backwaters on the decline. Never have the stakes been so high for even the most trivial tasks. <em>Citizen Sleeper 2</em> reminded me that letting go is often hard but necessary, and that knowing it isn’t the same thing as actually doing it.</p>

 <h2><em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000002350" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000002350"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000002350">Image: Sandfall Interactive</figcaption></figure> <p>Everyone’s favorite French-infused, Unreal Engine 5 reskin of <em>Final Fantasy X</em> is as good as they say. I’m not on board with all of the game’s narrative choices, and I’m less impressed by the apparent novelty of a good JRPG in the year 2025 than some, but<em> Clair Obscur</em> is rock solid in so many departments and sets a new gold-standard for (non-tactical) turn-based combat. The writing and performances are especially superb, and none of it would amount to a hill of beans without the (mostly) excellent soundtrack.</p>

 <h2><em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000000896" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000000896"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000000896">Nintendo</figcaption></figure> <p>If we judged games by merely by the sum of the joy or boredom they produced moment-to-moment, <em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em> would not rank very highly. But games are more than just graphs of the emotions they produce across dozens of hours of playtime.<em> Donkey Kong Bananza</em> is an ambitiously chaotic action platforming collectathon that feels incredibly novel for the first five to eight hours, loses all steam and inventiveness in the second and third acts, and then comes roaring back with one of the best closers of any modern Nintendo game. Could <em>Bananza</em> have been more? Probably. Was it enough? Definitely.</p> <h2><em>Elden Ring Nightreign</em></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000001602" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000001602"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000001602">FromSoftware</figcaption></figure> <p><em>Nightreign</em> is an excellent action-RPG but a top-notch multiplayer game. It uses the superficial trappings of a <em>Fortnite</em>-like battle royale to completely reinvent open-world exploration, problem solving, and the classic FromSoftware boss fight. It’s less like being thrust into an i-frame boot camp than embarking on a road trip where you know the car will lose a tire, run out of gas, and stall out in the worst possible place, but persevere and the place where you break down in the middle of the night will soon begin to feel like the home you never knew you missed.</p> <h2><em>Final Fantasy Tactics: The Ivalice Chronicles</em></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000628143" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000628143"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000628143">Square Enix</figcaption></figure> <p>The best RPG job system to ever do it, combined with an A-tier story and S-tier music, yields an all-time classic that never fails to prove why so many people are still obsessed with it, whether you give it one hour or 20. The remaster is overly cautious with improvements and stingy with new content, but it avoids the cardinal sin of trying and failing to improve on what was already a masterpiece.</p>

 <h2><em>Ghost of Yotei</em></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000628704" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000628704"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000628704">Sucker Punch Productions / Sony</figcaption></figure> <p>Last month I went to an Italian restaurant and ordered their Spicy Crab Vodka. The first bite was surprisingly delicious. Every bite after that was equally delicious. The fact that every bite from beginning to end effectively tasted the same did not diminish the dish’s overall effect, or how much I still think about it. <em>Ghost of Yotei</em> feels a bit like that. What it lacks in variety or novelty, it more than makes up for with quality, craftmanship, and the confidence to know exactly what it is and be the best version of that. It’s impressively huge and uncompromisingly slick, backed up by great writing and some incredible performances.</p> <h2><em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000639596" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000639596"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000639596">Team Cherry</figcaption></figure> <p>I played a lot of great 2D action games this year. None of them, in scope, precision, and ambition, ultimately held a candle to <em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em>. It incorporates some of the tried-and-true elements of Metroidvanias and Soulslikes but transforms them into a unique, intimate, at times frustratingly galling journey that asks a lot of you but is generous with its rewards. It’s not perfect, but the flaws it does have only come into focus because of everything else it nails. On my deathbed a snow globe will slip from my hands and crash onto the floor as I mutter the name “Bell Beast.”</p>

 <h2><em>Split Fiction</em></h2> <figure id="attachment_2000005179" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000005179"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000005179">Hazelight Studios</figcaption></figure> <p>It’s never a good sign when I want to start off an entry with some sort of acknowledgement of a game’s biggest weakness, but maybe it’s a testament to just how insanely smartly designed <em>Split Fiction</em> is that its trite premise and often grating banter did not substantially detract from the whole experience. <em>Split Fiction</em> is so effortlessly good at what it does, it makes it easy to overlook just how infrequent it is to get such a tightly paced, well-balanced action-adventure, particularly one that keeps finding ingenious ways to one-up itself all the way through to the very end.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Konami Is Aiming to Release a New Silent Hill Game in 2026, and in 2027, 2028, 2029, etc, “To Keep the Buzz Around Silent Hill Constant”]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/konami-aiming-to-release-new-silent-hill-game-each-year-to-keep-buzz-constant/</link>
            <guid>1394074</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Before <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-silent-hill-2-remake-has-sold-over-2-5-million-units/">Bloober Team's Silent Hill 2 Remake</a> was released in 2024, the most recent <strong>Silent Hill</strong> game was technically P.T. in 2014, the famous teaser that never became a full project. Before that, it was Silent Hill: Book of Memories on the PS Vita. Whether you count P.T. or not, that's still at least a decade between releases. Now, after Silent Hill 2 Remake in 2024, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/silent-hill-f-reaches-1-million-copies-sold-faster-than-silent-hill-2-remake-konami/">now Silent Hill f in 2025</a>, we've had two Silent Hill games in two years, and according to <strong>Konami</strong>, the company wants to keep that pace up if it can.</p>



<p>In an interview with <a href="https://www.famitsu.com/article/202512/61923?page=7">Famitsu</a> (via machine translation), producer <strong>Motoi Okamoto</strong> says the company is aiming "<em>to release about one [Silent Hill] title per year, including both announced and unannounced titles</em>," turning the long-dormant horror series into an annual franchise.</p>



<p>Now, Okamoto doesn't call this goal a new mandate for the company and the franchise. It doesn't seem to be the case that he wants Konami to have a Call of Duty-style development pipeline to ensure that they can pump out a new game on an annual basis. But he describes it as a goal the company would like to hit, in an effort to "<em>keep the buzz around Silent Hill constant</em>."</p>



<p>"<em>Following the release of Silent Hill 2 in October 2024, we were able to deliver Silent Hill f in September 2025, and the Silent Hill series is now back on track. We aim to release about one title per year, including both announced and unannounced titles. We're not sure how far we can achieve this, but we'll do our best as the producer of the Silent Hill series. Ideally, we'd like to keep the buzz around Silent Hill constant</em>."</p>



<p>Could Konami set up its own production pipeline to make its horror franchise an annual series? Sure, it could; it's definitely a big enough company, and it could easily throw money at both establishing teams of developers internally and contracting other studios to make new games in the franchise each year. </p>



<p>It even theoretically has another two years of leeway to set up such a pipeline, with <a href="https://wccftech.com/silent-hill-remake-bloober/">Bloober Team already working on a remake of the first Silent Hill game</a>, which could arrive in 2027, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/silent-hill-townfall-listed-retailer-march-26-2026-launch/">Silent Hill: Townfall set to arrive in 2026</a>.</p>



<p>Is that what it should try to do with the series? That's a different question with a different, and more complex answer. Trying to push out new games in the series before they're ready could be the noose that Konami ties itself and hangs the series on. A quick glance at any game franchise that has annual releases, like EA Sports titles and <a href="https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-team-vows-no-more-back-to-back-releases-after-black-ops-7-flop/">Call of Duty,</a> shows that you can't possibly keep up the level of quality we've seen, even with the previous two titles, year-in and year-out.</p>



<p>Keeping "<em>the buzz</em>," as Okamoto describes it, around the series, a constant factor could arguably be hampered by trying to release a new game every year. Especially as the quality of releases degrades, as it is likely to do with a new release annually. If Bloober Team is able to release the remake of the first game by 2027, and Townfall makes its rumoured 2026 release, then we'll see where Konami is at in 2027 with making what Okamoto describes as an ideal a reality.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/these-are-the-guys-who-brought-gta-v-s-thug-trio-to-lif-1333412658">Actor Ned Luke,</a> who portrays Michael De Santa in <em>Grand Theft Auto V</em> and <em>GTA Online,</em> has been swatted a lot. In fact, he gets swatted so often that in a recent clip going viral online, it appears that he and one of the officers checking on the call know each other by name after so many run-ins.</p> <p>Last week, <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2651379727?tt_content=full_vod_button&amp;tt_medium=clips_watch_page&amp;t=0h37m32s">during a <em>GTA Online</em> livestream with <em>Red Dead Redemption</em> voice actor Rob Wiethoff</a>, Ned Luke was swatted by someone. While Luke played the game live on Twitch, two police officers were invited into his house by someone. One of the officers then yelled out to Luke, “You’re being swatted again!” as he entered the room. Here’s the clip from the December 23 stream as shared by YouTube channel IceBladeNinja.</p>  <div> <p>Swatting is the act of calling the police on someone who is streaming in the hopes that law enforcement will arrest or disrupt the content creator. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swatting#Injuries_or_deaths_due_to_swatting">It’s a dangerous thing to do</a> in a country like the United States, which has armed officers ready to open fire.</p> <p>This most recent swatting incident for Luke happened about <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/nedluke/clip/BloodyEnergeticVanillaHoneyBadger-tg-qEFmBN165JTKk">30 minutes into the stream</a>. After a short and friendly chat with law enforcement, Luke continued broadcasting on Twitch for another hour and a half. Based on publicly posted information from the actor, this appears to be at least the eighth time since late 2023 that the 67-year-old has been swatted while streaming online. That might explain why the police officers in the clip above seem so chill, and one of them appears to be on a first-name basis with the actor.</p> <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-5-michael-actor-ned-luke-swatted-while-playing-on-thanksgiving-stream">In November 2023, on Thanksgiving,</a> Luke was swatted. He posted about the incident online, <a href="https://x.com/ned_luke/status/1728128625734742489">claiming it was the sixth time</a> it had happened to him due to his private details, like his address, being leaked online in the past. <a href="https://gamevro.com/ned-luke-gta-5-voice-actor-swatted-again-livestream/">On December 29, 2023</a>, Luke was once again swatted, this time with police officers calling him and asking the actor to step outside. ‘</p> <p>Hopefully Luke won’t have to put up with frequent swatting in the future. <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DSv1RJVkezG/">On December 27, the actor posted on Instagram</a> that at least one person involved with swatting him was now facing federal charges and would be in court in January of 2026 over their alleged swatting activity. “Fuck around and find out,” said Luke on Instagram. “Many more names discovered and provided.”</p> </div>

                <p dir="ltr">What do you think of when you think of a woman in pain? There are no tidy universalisms here, but for many of us, even most of us, pain is private and domestic. You could think of a mother shouldering burdens alone while her husband is at work. The father in the waiting room while the mother screams with strangers. A woman going to the doctor about an ache, only for him to tell her to lose weight and deny the problem is even happening.</p><p dir="ltr">All these things are simple clichés--tropes stolen from life and television. When Silent Hill f conjures a woman's private pain, it is with cutting specificity. In one of the most grisly moments of body horror in video games this year (or ever, really), protagonist Hinako turns into an emblem of her own sorrow, her own compliance, her own screaming rage.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> How Silent Hill F Is Connected To The Rest Of The Series</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr"><strong>Spoilers follow.</strong></p><hr><p dir="ltr">Like its predecessors, Silent Hill f takes place both in a "real world," covered in fog and invaded by twisted human forms, and in an "other world," which distorts the real. Unlike its predecessors, the gap between the real world and the other world is clearly delineated. Whenever Hinako falls unconscious, she wakes up in the other world. At first, it would seem that her experiences in her hometown are "real" and her time in the other world, marked with Shinto monuments and dream mansions suspended over water, is fake. However, the game's first ending calls this binary into question. The sequence’s final moments reveal Hinako to be much older now than her appearance would suggest. The girl we've been playing the whole time is almost a psychic scream, a representation of the younger Hinako whose dreams were betrayed by the older.</p><p dir="ltr">What was that betrayal? Nothing but the rite promised to all women: marriage. Her parents have promised Hinako to a suitor to settle a family debt. The real world represents how the arrangement slowly strips away her connections to her friends, her family, and herself . The other world stands in for the process of her courtship. The process of playing Silent Hill f, at least in an initial playthrough, is the process of tearing Hinako apart along those axes. She is both victim and thief. One version of her weds the thing that drains the other's world of life.</p><p dir="ltr">In the other world, a mysterious man only called Fox Mask courts Hinako. After a few preliminary trials, including ritualistic killings of her close friends, Hinako descends a staircase to yet another set of ritual grounds. At each site, a new torture awaits. First, Hinako saws off her own arm, then cultists brand her back, and finally, they slice a portion of her face off and replace it with a fox mask of her own. It is easy enough, though gruesome, to write it out. But the visual presentation is grueling.</p><p dir="ltr">Before each ritual, the fox cult display the tools of their torture. Then, they go about their work. The camera work is unsparring, but off center. We see a medium close-up of Hinako's face as she pulls the saw across her shoulder, or blood spilling between her feet as one cultist carves a knife into her face. There is a sense of witnessing, wanting to avert your eyes, but not being able to look away. Like all of Silent Hill f's cutscenes, there are no interactive elements. Here, that fact underlines how Hinako is treated as an object, which Fox Mask and the cultists chisel to their own liking.</p><p dir="ltr">Outside of words of comfort and strength from Fox Mask, the cultists are totally silent as they conduct the rituals. They communicate their intent only through gesture and presentation. The effect is almost like a pantomime. These rituals are familiar to everyone present except Hinako. The camera frames her alone, in ordinary schoolgirl clothes, totally surrounded. She is ignorant; the cultists are her teachers. They cut their lessons on her body.</p><p dir="ltr">Hinako's violent transformation rings out across the rest of the game. For one, it acts as the most profound distinction between the two Hinakos. While the student Hinako wields baseball bats, pipes, and if she is lucky, a kitchen knife in the real world, the other Hinako gains a magnificent, monstrous fox arm, a spiritual weapon that will never decay or break. The brand lets her open new doors, while the mask sees hidden paths. The more Hinako becomes a bride, the more power she gains.</p><p dir="ltr">However, that power makes her more vulnerable. With each power, Hinako's "sanity" meter drains. Whether it is an accurate localization or not, I feel "sanity" does not accurately communicate how the mechanic works. One could also describe it as "will" or "resistance." Hinako's fox powers drain sanity and the regular food objects of the town restore it. It represents Hinako's willingness to give in to becoming a bride. The more Hinako embraces the fox, the more sanity she'll expend. The difference in how those mechanics impact the two different Hinakos makes an argument. Every time you use the arm, or regret its absence, you cannot help but think of Hinako's pain in acquiring it, of the tears of blood rolling down her cheeks.</p><p dir="ltr">The ritual's horrifying power is something of a double-edged sword. In subsequent endings, the game turns redemptive. Fox Mask, actually a boy named Tsuneki Kotoyuki, is kind-hearted and well-meaning. Hinako reconciles her two selves. There aren't exactly any thematic problems with this. Fox Mask's good intentions are even a profound provocation. The system dehumanizes, however kind-hearted or well-meaning its agents are. Yet, Silent Hill f's ultimate run of boss fights and reconciliations can't help but feel hollow in the face of the game's prior violences.</p><p dir="ltr">Still, it's hard to hold its deflating final ending, unlocked after a minimum of three complete runs, too much against Silent Hill f. Few games can claim to have any moments of such startling, unsettling power. Fewer still elaborate on those moments with intelligence and complexity. Silent Hill f does both and much more besides. It matters how much a game makes you feel. Each time Hinako bowed her head to harm, I felt such terror, revulsion, and aching, aching sadness. The feeling will stay with me long after the details of Silent Hill f are gone from my memory.</p>

			<p>It's finally time to discover <strong>Wccftech's five best games of 2025</strong>. But first, let's take a moment to look at what happened this year in gaming.</p>



<p>Sadly, it was another year of <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-mass-gaming-layoffs-have-begun/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>heavy layoffs</strong></a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/monolith-productions-is-no-more-wb-games-also-shuts-down-player-first-games-wb-games-san-diego/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>studio closures</strong></a>, as the industry continues to readjust to the post-pandemic world and the challenges of a market entirely saturated with game releases that often steal each other's visibility. The other major topic of the year was the use of AI, which divided opinions within the development community and <a href="https://wccftech.com/larian-studios-ceo-responds-backlash-over-genai-use-divinity-baldurs-gate-3/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">culminated in the Larian controversy</a> when the studio admitted to using it during production to expedite certain basic tasks. It's easy to predict that this subject will be discussed more in the coming years, with further controversies likely to arise.</p>



<p>Thankfully, many great new releases brought fun and joy to all those who genuinely love this entertainment medium. When looking closer at the most unanimously acclaimed new titles launched this year, by the way, it's hard not to call 2025 the year of the indie-ish.</p>



<p>Some of the best games released this year were, after all, made by smaller studios with budgets that did not even approach the dozens or even hundreds of millions that the top studios can spend nowadays. Perhaps that's not so unheard of, but the difference is, those games tended to be the so-called 'rough gems', often featuring innovative mechanics but also a lot of 'jank' somewhere in the overall product due to a lack of resources. </p>



<p>This time, though, these games were almost as polished as the best triple-A examples, and often outshone them in innovation and ingenuity. That said, there were also some great AAA releases this year. Without further ado, keep scrolling to read our ten best games of 2025 and vote in the community poll.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/clair_obscur_expedition_33-HD-scaled.jpeg"></a></figure>



<h2 id="h-clair-obscur-expedition-33-9-5">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 (<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/clair-obscur-expedition-33-dont-fear-the-paintress/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">9.5</a>)</h2>



<p>The poster child of the small-team revolution is undoubtedly French developer Sandfall Interactive. With a budget of less than ten million dollars for their debut game, they proved that turn-based JRPGs are absolutely vital and that small developers can punch so far above their weight that they even outshine far bigger, critically acclaimed productions, breaking the existing record for most prizes won at an edition of The Game Awards with 9.</p>



<p>Most importantly, they delivered an amazing, unforgettable game in the hands of fans. Here's Francesco De Meo's summary from the Wccftech review:</p>



<p><em>Sandfall Interactive’s debut shattered expectations in the best possible way. With a gripping story, a beautifully written cast of characters, and engaging gameplay that breathes new life into familiar mechanics, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 is a journey that leaves a lasting mark on both the mind and the heart.</em></p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Hades-2-Art-HD-scaled.jpeg"></a></figure>



<h2 id="h-hades-ii-10">Hades II (<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/hades-2-supergiant-guide-us/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">10</a>)</h2>



<p>Despite being an independent company of a small size (around 25 employees), Supergiant Games is no stranger to having its games celebrated far and wide. Almost all of its games (Bastion, Transistor, Pyre, and Hades) received acclaim, and the first Hades even won several game awards. This time, though, they attempted a sequel and absolutely nailed it, as mentioned in David Carcasole's review:</p>



<p><em>Hades 2 is a stunning follow-up to an already incredible game. It does everything its predecessor did right, and then expands on it in meaningful ways that add depth to the gameplay, narrative, and visual experience (which was already deep in the original Hades). It's a shining example of how a sequel can take everything right about what came before, turn it all up to 11, and even go a bit further.</em></p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/silksong_art-HD-scaled.jpeg"></a></figure>



<h2 id="h-hollow-knight-silksong">Hollow Knight: Silksong </h2>



<p>Team Cherry's latest game was also a sequel to a beloved indie title. The Australian team surprised everyone with the original Hollow Knight in 2017, selling over 15 million copies in eight years and garnering acclaim as one of the greatest Metroidvania games ever made. </p>



<p>However, the development of Silksong was quite long. It actually started even before the release of Hollow Knight as a DLC for that game, but then it morphed into a much larger project, and the developers went quiet for a very long time. In 2023, they <a href="https://wccftech.com/hollow-knight-silksong-delayed-as-development-is-still-continuing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced another delay</a>, and it wasn't until the latter half of this year that we got the very first details about Silksong, just in advance of its September 4 launch.</p>



<p>In the end, the long wait was absolutely worth it, as Silksong received heaps of praise for the game's artistic vision and its improvements to key systems, including combat, pacing, boss fights, and narrative. Silksong is a challenging game, but it's also fair, which is another feat that's far from easy to accomplish. Thus, it earns its rightful place among the best games of 2025.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/a316285a09eceee300a8f0cb007599cf20aa6404a105a05a-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>



<h2 id="h-dispatch">Dispatch</h2>



<p>Whereas both Silksong and Hades were sequels to beloved indie games, <a href="https://wccftech.com/ex-telltale-devs-announced-release-date-new-dispatch-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dispatch</a> came out of nowhere with a brand new IP. Granted, many of the members of AdHoc Studio had previously worked on Telltale's successful releases, but Dispatch was still a big surprise. Who knew that having to ditch a cool mech for a desk job would be so fun?</p>



<p>Seriously, though, the game is incredibly well-made in every regard, from the gorgeous comic-book-inspired art style to the witty dialogues, iconic characters, and engaging story that is as far removed from traditional superhero fare as you could imagine. At its budget price, it is practically a must-buy.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/SplitFiction_KeyArt_RGB-HD-scaled.jpeg"></a></figure>



<h2 id="h-split-fiction-8">Split Fiction (<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/split-fiction/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">8</a>)</h2>



<p>Hazelight Studios is another team that started small and slowly carved itself a niche for split-screen co-op exclusive games with interesting settings and stories. Their new game, Split Fiction, is every bit as enjoyable as A Way Out and It Takes Two, and even more refined in some areas. Critics and fans alike loved it; the game <a href="https://wccftech.com/split-fiction-becomes-million-seller-in-just-two-days/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">became a million seller in just two days</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-says-split-fiction-had-hugely-successful-launch-with-almost-4-million-copies-sold/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">surpassed four million units sold in two months</a>. There's even <a href="https://wccftech.com/sydney-sweeney-will-reportedly-star-in-a-split-fiction-movie-adaptation-with-wicked-director-jon-m-chu-at-the-helm/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a movie on the way with Sydney Sweeney set to star</a> (in all likelihood, as Zoe Foster). If you have someone else who enjoys playing this type of game, getting it for co-op is a no-brainer.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Kingdom-Come-Deliverance-II.jpg"></a></figure>



<h2 id="h-kingdom-come-deliverance-ii-10">Kingdom Come: Deliverance II (<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">10</a>)</h2>



<p>Warhorse Studios was once an independent studio as well. The first Kingdom Come: Deliverance was crowdfunded via Kickstarter, after all, but following that game's successful release, the Czech developer <a href="https://wccftech.com/thq-nordic-kingdom-come-deliverance-warhorse/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was acquired by THQ Nordic</a> (now Plaion). With a much larger budget at their disposal, they were able to create a much bigger, not to mention more refined, open world RPG that fully realizes their original vision. Chris Wray gave it a perfect ten and commented:</p>



<p><em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance II is a resounding success, delivering one of the most believable game worlds ever, layered with compelling quests, small and large alike, and enhancing the already interesting systems introduced in the original. With multiple systems layered to immerse you in the game, as well as an intriguing story and excellent polish, it makes for one of the more captivating open world RPGs.</em></p>

<p>Sucker Punch struck gold with Ghost of Tsushima, 2020's excellent action/adventure game. Their new IP sold exceptionally well, prompting Sony to get John Wick director Chad Stahelski to direct a movie adaptation and, of course, fast-tracking a sequel at the Bellevue-based studio. With Ghost of Yotei, the studio retained the same formula, refined it, and presented it with another great story that every samurai fan won't want to miss. Here's an excerpt from my review:</p>



<p><em>Ghost of Yōtei is a worthy sequel to the already excellent Ghost of Tsushima, building upon that game's foundation with an equally interesting (albeit quite different) plot and select improvements to combat and open world exploration. It may feel a little too familiar, not to mention similar to the previous game, but that sensation is quickly forgotten amidst all the fun you'll have in Ezo.</em></p>

<h2 id="h-death-stranding-2-on-the-beach">Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</h2>



<p>Hideo Kojima has returned this year with the second chapter in the post-apocalyptic adventures of Sam (Norman Reedus), this time set in Australia. The gameplay of Death Stranding 2: On the Beach is much more varied than the first 'strand game', and there's also a vastly improved combat system. The presentation is simply unparalleled, and the performances of the whole cast are fantastic. </p>



<p>It may still not be for everyone, but Death Stranding 2: On the Beach is nonetheless undoubtedly worthy of appearing in our best games of 2025 list.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/ARC_Raiders_A_KeyArt_Main_01_Horizontal_3840x2160-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>



<h2 id="h-arc-raiders-9">ARC Raiders (<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/arc-raiders-review-speak-softly-and-carry-a-wolfpack/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">9</a>)</h2>



<p>If you told most people a year ago that ARC Raiders would not only be in this list but also one of those with the best chances to win, they would not have believed it. Embark stunned everyone with how refreshing ARC Raiders turned out to be, not to mention incredibly well-balanced between its PvE and PvP elements. In Wccftech's review, Kai Tatsumoto wrote:</p>



<p><em>All in all, ARC Raiders is a phenomenal entry in the growing loot-and-scoot genre, or extraction shooter if you want to be more technical about it. While the gunplay suffers in the early stages with inferior tier one weaponry, it shines through once you start developing squad tactics and learn the ins and outs of besting the array of lethal ARC threats throughout Toledo. I wanted to wait until the first major content push from Embark Studios before finalizing my thoughts, and the inclusion of Stella Montis has brought a new flavor of psychological warfare to escalate this extraction shooter to greater heights.</em></p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/battlefield-6-art-HD-1-scaled.jpeg"></a></figure>



<h2 id="h-battlefield-6-8-5">Battlefield 6 (<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/battlefield-6-battlefield-is-mostly-back/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">8.5</a>)</h2>



<p>Out of all the games on this list, Battlefield 6 might have been the most anticipated in terms of sheer fanbase size coming into 2025. The excellent news for Battlefield fans is that their beloved military shooter franchise is back with a new installment that understands what made the best games in the saga so great. The natural outcome was for Battlefield 6 to become the best-selling game of the year, with estimates placing it near the 24 million units sold milestone.</p>



<p>In Wccftech's review, David Carcasole stated:</p>



<p><em>Battlefield 6 is an incredibly strong return to form for the series, with a multiplayer experience that is finely tuned with huge potential for what it could build into, destruction mechanics that bring a level of immersion back to the series that it was missing, and a more than solid visual and sound design package tying up how endlessly fun it is to play.</em></p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/steam-top-selling-2025-monster-hunter-wilds-pc-performance-digital-foundry-2000655990</link>
            <guid>1394035</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Valve has revealed the official list of best-selling games on Steam for 2025. They include everything you’d expect, plus a few surprises. <a href="https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-review-ps5-open-world-rpg-capcom-1851766113"><em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em></a> ended up beating out <em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em> and others for a spot in the top dozen, despite being recently labeled as one of the worst PC ports of the year by <em>Digital Foundry</em>.</p> <p>Here’s the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/charts/bestofyear/2025">full list of the top 24 best-selling new Steam games,</a> broken up into two sections. The games within the sections are in no particular order. First, the top 12:</p> <ul> <li><em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em></li> <li><em>Elden Ring Nightreign </em></li> <li><em>The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered </em></li> <li><em>EA Sports FC 26 </em></li> <li><em>Borderlands 4 </em></li> <li><em>Schedule I </em></li> <li><em>Hollow Knight: Silksong </em></li> <li><em>Civilization VII </em></li> <li><em>Battlefield 6 </em></li> <li><em>Dune Awakening </em></li> <li><em>Arc Raiders </em></li> <li><em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 </em></li> </ul> <p>And numbers 13-24:</p> <ul> <li><em> Assassin’s Creed Shadows </em></li> <li><em>Dispatch </em></li> <li><em>Dying Light: The Beast </em></li> <li><em>Anno 117: Pax Romana </em></li> <li><em>Europa Universalis V </em></li> <li><em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 </em></li> <li><em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 </em></li> <li><em>Split Fiction </em></li> <li><em>Inzoi </em></li> <li><em>Doom: The Dark Ages </em></li> <li><em>Stellar Blade </em></li> <li><em>Digimon Story: Time Stranger</em></li> </ul> <p>The list includes the big blockbusters, but also more hardcore historical strategy games like <a href="https://kotaku.com/anno-117-pax-romana-ai-loading-screen-patch-ubisoft-2000644399"><em>Anno 117: Pax Romana</em></a> and <em>Europa Universalis V</em>. I was surprised to see <em>Civilization 7</em> in the top 12 despite its launch woes and fan discontent around some of the new features and the content-light end game. But then again, <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em> secured a top spot as well despite miserable user ratings as fans await still much-needed optimization patches.</p>

 <p>Capcom’s action-RPG also made <em>Digital Foundry</em>‘s list of the worst PC ports of 2025. The technical analysts there still seem flummoxed by how badly the game runs, even after its latest Title 4 Update, and even as the publisher’s upcoming work like <em>Pragmata</em> and <em>Resident Evil Requiem</em> appears to be doing just fine on the platform. “Definitely one of the poorest games I’ve reviewed in a long time from a technical performance perspective,” Alex Battaglia said during the outlet’s <a href="https://youtu.be/s3_0yhXDKTs">annual look back video</a>.</p>

 <p>Capcom has promised <a href="https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-mhw-tu4-title-update-4-pc-fixed-2000652579">bigger performance improvements in 2026</a>, but even those will be spread out across a couple of months. It’ll be the one-year anniversary of <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em>‘ launch and PC players will still be waiting to see if the game will finally be passable on that platform or if it’ll continue to run with framerate hitching and texture pop-in, among other issues.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[ARC Raiders, Schedule I, Hollow Knight Silksong and Battelfield 6 Are Some of 2025’s Best Selling New Games on Steam]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/arc-raiders-schedule-i-hollow-knight-silksong-battlefield-6-steam-best-selling-new-games-2025/</link>
            <guid>1394008</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>At the time of this writing, there are still just under 60 hours left in 2025, which means that the jury is still out on which game was the best-selling game of the year on the biggest PC storefront, Steam. That said, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/charts/bestofyear/2025"><strong>Steam Charts</strong></a> has already declared the games that were part of the top 100 best-selling games by revenue on the platform, and while it doesn't list the titles in order, we know that some of the top 12 games include ARC Raiders, Schedule I, Hollow Knight Silksong, and Battlefield 6.</p>



<p>At least that's the case for the list of new games released in 2025. When you look at top sellers across the platform, including games not released in 2025, the top 12 look more like what you'd expect, with Counter-Strike 2, Dota 2, PUBG, Apex Legends, and Marvel Rivals making up almost half of the top 12.</p>



<p>As for the new releases, however, the top 12 make it clear that games with a multiplayer focus are still the majority of what sells on the platform, with 9/12 games either featuring multiplayer or having multiplayer as the core element. But that's not to say single-player experiences aren't selling or essential to what players are looking for today.</p>



<p>Dune: Awakening may be a multiplayer game, but you can experience so much of it without really interacting with other players. Hollow Knight Silksong is an entirely solo journey, as is The Elder Scrolls IV Oblivion Remastered and Kingdom Come: Deliverance II, all of which made the top 12.</p>



<p>Here's the full list of the top 12 best-selling new games on Steam for 2025, sorted randomly:</p>



<ul>
<li>Elden Ring Nightreign</li>



<li>Battlefield 6</li>



<li>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2</li>



<li>Borderlands 4</li>



<li>ARC Raiders</li>



<li>Schedule I</li>



<li>Sid Meier's Civilization VII</li>



<li>EA Sports FC 26</li>



<li>Monster Hunter Wilds</li>



<li>Dune: Awakening</li>



<li>Hollow Knight Silksong</li>



<li>The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered</li>
</ul>



<p>The other notable element to this list is what's left off, specifically Call of Duty: Black Ops 7, which was able to make the next tier of best-selling games, but couldn't beat Battlefield 6 and Borderlands 4, the two other first-person shooters you could argue are its biggest competition.</p>



<p>It's also worth pointing out that, whatever your stance on <a href="https://wccftech.com/amidst-arc-raiders-success-embarks-use-of-gen-ai-voices-bubbles-over-even-epics-ceo-joins-the-fray/">Embark Studio's use of GenAI</a>, it is incredibly impressive for ARC Raiders to arrive as a brand-new franchise and be one of the year's most popular, best-selling titles. ARC Raiders and Schedule I are the only two games that aren't based on a previously-existing franchise or series that made the list, and Schedule I's accomplishment is even more impressive when you factor in the fact that it's a self-published indie game.</p>



<p>The final tally will come after 2025 is officially over, and we'll get a list that's not in a random order once firms like Circana and Newzoo publish their findings. In the meantime, you can check out Wccftech's Best of 2025 lists, which include several of the top-selling games mentioned. Like Hollow Knight Silksong's appearance in <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-platformers-of-2025-jumping-and-smashing-to-victory/">Best Platformers</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-indie-games-of-2025-the-year-of-the-indie/">Best Indie Games</a>, or ARC Raiders and Battlefield 6 making the cut for <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-multiplayer-games-of-2025-the-power-of-togetherness/">Best Multiplayer Games</a>.</p>

              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/kenneth-shepards-top-10-games-of-2025-pokemon-hundred-2000655496"><span>I loved </span><i><span>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</span></i></a><span>, but looking at a game in every stage of its development is inevitably going to make you wish a studio had been able to implement every idea it had into the final product. The infamous </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-leak-generation-10-wind-wave-galar-legends-mmo-2000635337"><span>Game Freak Teraleak</span></a><span> from </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-hack-teraleak-gen-10-switch-2-game-freak-beta-1851671688"><span>last year</span></a><span> has given us a pretty thorough look at </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-review-switch-2-bugs-performance-2000637719"><i><span>Legends: Z-A</span></i><span>’s</span></a><span> journey from design doc to finished game, and while it’s interesting to see these screenshots and pieces of test footage, it also has fans weighing in on Game Freak’s processes and sharing how they feel about the final product now that they’ve seen how the sausage was made.</span></p> <p><span>YouTuber </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3sdVmay2ky0"><span>TurtleBro</span></a><span> compiled all his findings in the Teraleak into a feature-length video that goes chronologically through </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A</span></i><span>’s development files dating back to 2022, shortly after work on </span><i><span>Legends: Arceus</span></i><span> had wrapped up. Some files are from so early in the process that Game Freak was using </span><i><span>Legends: Arceus</span></i><span>’ Irida as a placeholder for the player. These screenshots and videos show some cut content and features, like additional building interiors to explore, being able to use overworld abilities around </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-lumiose-city-ending-zohran-mamdani-2000641431"><span>Lumiose City</span></a><span>, and even some additional multiplayer modes that had players throwing Poké Balls at one another, dodgeball style.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>Perhaps most surprising in these early builds is a much </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-z-small-boring-map-how-big-time-to-walk-around-2000636148"><span>higher level of environmental detail</span></a><span> than we see in the final game. </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A</span></i><span> was memed to hell and back for its flat-textured buildings, and some of the first pieces of footage TurtleBro shows off include windows and building structures that are much more detailed. In January of 2023, many of these assets were swapped for something similar to the flat ones we have in the game now, and internal notes suggest this downgrade was a “burden” on the team. It’s here you can see a lot of the game’s initial ambitions get pulled back, though some things, like the real-time, action-based combat system, started to take shape here, albeit in a more third-person shooter style than the command-based one we have now. By March of that year, the team was on track to deliver the game we got, and morale started to improve.</span></p>

 <p><span>There’s one aspect of the development timeline that is kind of fascinating considering 2024 was the first time in quite a few years since there wasn’t a new </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>game </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-mega-dimension-review-dlc-raichu-2000653106"><span>or expansion</span></a><span>: it sounds like </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A </span></i><span>was feature complete by June 2024, and Game Freak spent around 16 months on polish before it launched the game on October 16, 2025. </span></p>

 <p><span>TurtleBro speculates that the reason the game’s visuals were deliberately downgraded was to give the team the year to spend refining the game in order to avoid a massive performance fiasco like the one that surrounded </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-scarlet-violet-dlc-teal-mask-indigo-disk-gen-9-1851109325"><i><span>Scarlet </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Violet</span></i><span> in 2022</span></a><span>, though others who viewed the game less charitably </span><a href="https://x.com/soulsilverart/status/2005368278689222901"><span>suspect Game Freak may have just shelved </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A</span></i></a><span> for over a year and moved onto a new project, rather than using that time for meaningful iteration. It’s unclear, however, as the development details stop at this point; the Teraleak occurred in August, and thus, we don’t have any more of these design docs that might confirm the team’s thinking.</span></p>

 <p><span>Overall, it’s a fascinating look at how </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A</span></i><span> went from concept to finished game, and TurtleBro does a great job of comparing images of aspects of the game from early in development to what those aspects look and play like in the actual, released game you can play on your Switch or Switch 2. Check out the full video below:</span></p>

  <p><span>I do mourn some of the stuff we lost in the development process, but that’s the risk you take when you look at unfinished work. The video puts the leaks we’ve seen from the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-gen-10-wind-wave-map-leak-pikachu-professor-2000655613"><span>upcoming </span><i><span>Pokémon Wind </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Wave </span></i><span>games</span></a><span> into perspective, serving as a reminder that several of the mechanics and concepts those leaks have revealed may not make it into the final product, either. We’ll know for sure when those games are revealed, which will likely happen for the series’ 30th anniversary next year.</span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">CD Projekt has sold its DRM-free PC storefront GOG to its original co-founder, Michał Kiciński, for 90.7 million Polish złoty (approx. $25.2 million). Kiciński is also co-founder of CD Projekt itself, and currently holds 10% of share capital in the business.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Kiciński co-founded GOG in 2008, and it has operated within the CD Projekt Group for over 17 years. Selling GOG “fits” CD Projekt’s long-term strategy, according to <a href="https://www.gog.com/blog/gog-is-getting-acquired-by-its-original-co-founder-what-it-means-for-you/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a FAQ posted online</a>. CD Projekt, the Polish company behind smash hits The Witcher 3 and Cyberpunk 2077, wants to focus on video game development and other projects, it said. CD Projekt is currently developing The Witcher 4 and Cyberpunk 2.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Selling GOG fits CD Projekt’s long-term strategy,” reads the statement. “CD Projekt wants to focus its full attention on creating top-quality RPGs and providing our fans with other forms of entertainment based on our brands. This deal lets CD Projekt keep that focus, while GOG gets stronger backing to pursue its own mission.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Kiciński commented: “From the very beginning, GOG has always been built on strong values and clear principles. When Marcin Iwiński and I came up with the idea for GOG, the vision was simple: bring classic games back to players and ensure that once you buy a game, it truly belongs to you — forever.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">GOG will operate independently, it said, and continue with its DRM-free philosophy. Following the sale, CD Projekt and GOG signed a distribution agreement that specifies the terms of future cooperation, including a plan to release CD Projekt Red’s upcoming games on GOG.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“CD Projekt and GOG share the same roots and values: freedom, independence, and a genuine sense of ownership,” Kiciński continued. “I believe that CD Projekt, with its exceptional AAA games, will stand, as always, behind the GOG offering — making GOG the best place on the planet to purchase The Witcher and Cyberpunk games, both existing titles and the new ones we all anticipate so much.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“As a mature gamer, I often play classic games myself and deeply admire the creativity behind many of them. I truly believe that well-crafted classics can deliver as much joy as new releases. When it comes to pure playability, timeless games often prove to be really the safe choice, especially in a market flooded with gazillions of low-quality smaller games. Beyond preserving classics, GOG has always sought out new games with a retro spirit. I am personally involved in the development of a few games like that and they will certainly make their strong appearance on GOG in 2026.”</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Every CD Projekt Red Game In Development</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Michał Nowakowski, joint CEO of CD Projekt, added: “with our focus now fully on an ambitious development roadmap and expanding our franchises with new high-quality products, we felt this was the right time for this move.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“For a long time now, GOG has been operating independently. Now it’s going into very good hands — we are convinced that with the support of Michał Kiciński, one of GOG’s co-founders, its future will be full of great projects and successes. We would like to thank the GOG team for years of fruitful cooperation and wish them all the best. And to the GOG community, I say ‘see you around,’ because our upcoming releases will naturally be available on GOG as well.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">GOG has long competed with Steam for the hearts and minds of PC gamers by leaning on its no-DRM policy, although Valve's platform remains the overwhelming market leader. In the FAQ, the question ‘is GOG financially unstable?’ is asked. The answer, officially, is no. “GOG is stable and has had a really encouraging year,” reads the statement. “In fact, we’ve seen more enthusiasm from gamers towards our mission than ever before.” GOG hit the headlines recently for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/cd-projekts-pc-game-storefront-gog-gets-behind-horses-after-valve-steam-ban-players-should-be-able-to-choose-the-experiences-that-speak-to-them">getting behind indie game Horses after Valve banned it from Steam</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It sounds like from a user point of view, nothing changes here. As for CD Projekt, it can now strip out GOG from its business, which at latest count employed 1,335 staff. In The Witcher franchise it has the aforementioned The Witcher 4 as part of a new Witcher trilogy with Ciri as protagonist, The Witcher Remake, and Project Sirius. Cyberpunk 2 is also in development, as is Project Hadar, a new IP.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN. Find him on Twitter at @wyp100.

            <guid>1393957</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Using <strong>Generative AI</strong> in game development has been, and will continue to be, a controversial topic for the foreseeable future. Since <a href="https://wccftech.com/topic/tga/"><strong>The Game Awards</strong></a> and the <a href="https://wccftech.com/larian-studios-ceo-says-a-lot-has-become-lost-in-translation-over-genai-backlash/">backlash that hit Larian Studios following their CEO's admission to using GenAI</a> in the development of Divinity, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-stripped-of-indie-game-awards-goty-win-over-genai-use/">Sandfall Interactive's <strong>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</strong> losing one of its Game of the Year wins due to the studio using GenAI</a> in the game's development, it has once again been at the forefront of industry conversation. Now, Level-5 chief executive officer Akihiro Hino has weighed in with his view, prompted by Clair Obscur losing its GOTY win.</p>



<p><a href="https://x.com/AkihiroHino/status/2004439840868421650">In a post shared on Hino's official X (formerly Twitter) account</a>, Hino outlines that, in his view, GenAI is able to provide "<em>time savings that can't be dismissed</em>," and that if we continue to build "<em>the impression that 'using AI is bad,' it could seriously hinder the progress of modern digital tech</em>."</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="ja" dir="ltr"><p>今日はめずらしく、自分が作っているゲームの話ではないことを書きます。</p><p>【AIをめぐる騒動について】…</p></div>— 日野晃博 (@AkihiroHino) <a href="https://twitter.com/AkihiroHino/status/2004439840868421650?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 26, 2025</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>Hino begins by clarifying a point on GenAI surrounding one of Level-5's upcoming titles, after there were claims that the studio was letting generative AI do all the programming. The Professor Layton and Ni No Kuni developer is not doing that, according to Hino, and calls the whole thing a misunderstanding, saying, "<em>The truth of the matter is that there's an unreleased title themed around AI, and for that specific title, a programmer mentioned they're deliberately having AI handle the programming as well. They used that as an example to suggest that an era like that might be coming, and that's what got blown out of proportion</em>."</p>



<p>Hino then continues to share his viewpoint on GenAI, which emphasizes that the technology is a tool, and one that, ultimately, cannot be ignored.</p>



<p>"<em>AI is enabling time savings that can't be dismissed, and I believe this has the potential to upend common sense in game development. It might shift us from a world where developing the AAA games everyone wants to play takes 5-10 years to one where we get to enjoy them every two years. AI sometimes gets treated like it's synonymous with plagiarism, but a knife can be used for cooking or as a weapon; a computer can create games or enable cybercrime. AI might produce plagiarized content if misused, but if used properly, it has the power to enrich the creative world even further</em>."</p>



<p>"<em>I want to see games evolve even more in my lifetime</em>," Hino continues. "<em>I want to experience and create dreamlike games that surpass the standards of today's AAA titles. If we let the impression take hold here that 'using AI is evil,' it could seriously hinder the advancement of modern digital technology. I hope creators and audiences alike can recognize 'AI' as a tool that people use to make their works. Here's to hoping that various technological innovations lead to even greater growth in the game industry!</em>"</p>

            <guid>1393948</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Like everything else that was once popular, the early 2000s Fox TV comedy <em>Malcolm in the Middle</em> is returning in Spring 2026 with stars <a href="https://kotaku.com/shop-contest-frankie-muniz-winners-1838809743">Frankie Muniz</a>, Bryan Cranston, and Jane Kaczmarek all back to reprise their roles as Malcom, Hal, and Lois, respectively.</p> <p>On December 29, Disney and Hulu released the first trailer for <a href="https://people.com/frankie-muniz-malcolm-in-the-middle-reboot-trailer-exclusive-11875191"><em>Life’s Still Unfair</em></a>, an upcoming 4-episode<em> Malcom in the Middle</em> miniseries event set around 20 years after the original show, which ran from 2000 to 2006 on Fox. Here’s the trailer:</p>

  <p>And here’s the official synopsis for the miniseries, which will be exclusively available on Hulu and Disney+:</p> <blockquote><p>“After shielding himself and his daughter from his family for over a decade, Malcolm is dragged back into their orbit when Hal and Lois demand his presence at their 40th anniversary party.”</p></blockquote> <p>As a young pre-teen in the early 2000s, I watched a lot of <em>Malcolm in the Middle</em> during the show’s original run on TV. But like a lot of people, according to ratings data, I remember my family vaguely checking out around season four. Two years later, the show was canceled due to low ratings. Of course, nostalgia for content from this era is reaching its highest point as people who grew up in that era are now entering their 30s. So Malcolm and his family will soon return to TV (or internet streaming TV) as Hollywood execs and number crunchers hope to squeeze out as much profit and viewership from this reheated revival as they can before they move on to the next somewhat popular TV show or movie from about 20 years ago.</p>

 <p>I love leftovers as much as the next guy, but I’m not sure I need every TV show and movie I grew up with to return for what often ends up being forgettable and tired reunions. Anyway, <em>Malcolm in the Middle: Life’s Still Unfair</em> will premiere on Hulu and Disney+ on April 10, 2026. Regardless of how I feel about the revival, the show’s opening song still kicks ass.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/clair-obscur-chinese-rpg-sword-fairy-trailer-remake-2000655947</link>
            <guid>1393918</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>If you’re getting <a href="https://kotaku.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-rpg-review-in-progress-1851777402"><em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em></a> vibes from the new trailer for <em>Sword and Fairy 4: Remake</em>, you’re not alone. Some are pointing to the upcoming RPG as evidence that we’re about to get lot of copycats trying to ape the 2025 Game of the Year’s aura, similar to the wave of open-world games that borrowed elements from <em>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild </em>after that game’s incredible success. But <em>Sword and Fairy 4: Remake</em> didn’t spring up out of nowhere, and the series it’s a part of has a long history of its own.</p> <p>“This single-player&nbsp;turn-based RPG is reborn in Unreal Engine 5 with the latest technology,” publisher CubeGame <a href="https://twitter.com/CubeGameCN/status/2005594647792656573">announced on Monday</a>. “Set off on a journey to find the immortals with Tianhe Yun’s team. In the meantime, a hidden truth that has been sealed for a long time is revealing itself.” The update was accompanied by a fresh trailer that’s been turning heads for both its high production values and its flashy turn-based combat.</p>

  <p>That last part is the biggest reason why the game’s been drawing comparisons to <em>Clair Obscur</em>. Like this year’s hit RPG, <em>Sword and Fairy 4:</em> <em>Remake</em> seems to feature cinematic battle animations with lots of motion blur and slowdown, as well as a command wheel integrated into the scene rather than situated off to the side with the rest of the HUD. The fact that the whole thing is in Unreal Engine 5 adds another level of hyper-realistic sheen reminiscent of <em>Clair Obscur</em>.</p>

 <p>But while the internet has a penchant for condensing new stuff down into familiar buzz phrases and using the most popular things as lenses for understanding everything else, <em>Sword and Fairy 4: Remake</em> didn’t just fall out of a coconut tree. Quoting one site’s post about the game that called it a “<em>Clair Obscur</em>-like,” <em>The CRPG Book </em>editor <a href="https://crpgbook.wordpress.com/">Felipe Pepe</a> <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/felipepepe.bsky.social/post/3mb4tg7zfjk2v">wrote</a>, “I really hate how games media handles anything out of China. We’re getting a gorgeous remake of one of their best RPGs ever, but the clown does zero research about it and just goes ‘I’m getting a lot of Boss Baby vibes from this…'”</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">The original Sword and Fairy 4 looked like this, the second screenshot is the remake, and the third is Expedition 33.  </p> <p>The only bar you have to clear is to recognize shape and colors at this point, and you are failing miserably. My 3-year old cousin can see the similarities <a href="https://t.co/HCNNmqtPFV">https://t.co/HCNNmqtPFV</a> <a href="https://t.co/0X9sXdrz9o">pic.twitter.com/0X9sXdrz9o</a></p> <p>— Dream's Longest Day (@Dreamboum) <a href="https://twitter.com/Dreamboum/status/2005678913092231639?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 29, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>The first <em>The Legend of Sword and Fairy</em> launched for MS-DOS in 1995 and served as an analogue to <em>Final Fantasy</em> rooted in Chinese mythology, but it was never localized outside of East Asia. The most recent entry was 2021’s <em>Sword and Fairy 7</em> which abandoned turn-based combat for real-time action and is available on both PC and console. <em>Sword and Fairy 4: Remake</em>, meanwhile, is an update to the 2007 entry which <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1621680/Sword_and_Fairy_4/">also happens to be available on Steam</a>. It only looks like<em> Clair Obscur</em> to the degree that all turn-based battle RPGs have you similarly watching a static row of fighters enact the commands you select from a menu.</p>

 <p>It’s definitely possible that <em>Sword and Fairy 4: Remake</em> developer UP software has leaned into some of the stylistic RPG design choices we now associate with <em>Clair Obscur</em> in the year since that game blew up (trailers for it were getting fans hyped well before its 2025 release, too). But <em>Clair Obscur</em> owes some of those elements, including its flashy command wheel, to series that came before it, like <em>Persona</em>. <a href="https://kotaku.com/persona-director-says-jrpg-3-0-is-coming-to-re-shape-the-genre-at-a-fundamental-level-2000647233">As RPG fans have been reminding each other a lot this year</a>, the genre extends well beyond <em>Final Fantasy</em> and a certain modern French riff on the franchise.</p>

 <p>Maybe <em>Sword and Fairy 4: Remake</em><em>&nbsp;</em>will be the latest one to help players continue to expand their turn-based horizons.</p>

While I've been covering it as a journalist and critic for over a decade now, 2025 has been particularly brutal and antagonistic against creatives around the world. I've lost count of how many stories about layoffs I wrote. The corporate buzzwords from CEOs celebrating milestones at the end of financial quarters while people had lost their livelihoods days prior are forever present in my mind. Each unionization effort presented as much as a glimmer of hope as the collective exhaustion of people who just want to manifest the stories and the feelings that move them, creating art for others to inspire and relate to.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It's been a long and arduous year. But developers continued working on their games despite everything. My picks for this list represent that fervent perseverance turned into standout creativity, paired up with an attitude of wishing for better conditions for everyone, and the reminder that, at the end of the day, supporting one another and uniting against hate and injustice have never been more vital.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Absolum"><a target="_blank" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1904480/Absolum/">Absolum</a> (Dotemu/Guard Crush Games/Supamonks/Gamirror Games)</h2><p>Image via Dotemu/Guard Crush Games/Supamonks/Gamirror Games</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Beat 'em ups don't need to be overly complex to feel good to play and create a lasting memory, especially when playing with people on your side. </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Absolum</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, however, dares to try otherwise, and succeeds to great lengths.

Yet, the closer I got to the end of the year, the more fond I grew of it. The dice-heavy RPG iterates on the ethos of its predecessor, showcasing the damage of capitalism and overreliance on technology to the everyday folk, but it also increases the tension. It's a much tougher sequel, which in turn makes its themes all the more poignant. I don't think it's a coincidence that </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Citizen Sleeper 2</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> also introduces a crew feature where you recruit characters who join you on Cowboy Bebop-style expeditions.

I played it time and time again and never got tired of it. The music and aesthetics stuck with me all this time, especially since the team shared new tracks online and updated the demo build with songs. Finally getting to hear these songs in context in the story mode is its own achievement. But for me, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Unbeatable</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> has extended beyond being a simple game, but a special place I'll likely be returning to in perpetuity.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Shooty Shooty Robot Invasion"><a target="_blank" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3763820/Shooty_Shooty_Robot_Invasion/">Shooty Shooty Robot Invasion</a> (Bubby Darkstar/NoQuarter)</h2><p>Image via Bubby Darkstar/NoQuarter</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Shooty Shooty Robot Invasion</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> is as tired of the push for artificiality in our lives and the presence of billionaires as everyone else. To counter this, it invites you to join a group of rebels against a robot invasion, presenting a first-person shooter that basks in absurdity, chronically online jokes, and a saturated art style that gives life to an extensive cast of characters. It's a game that serves as much-needed catharsis, but it's the dialogue and comedy woven throughout that kept me invested, making me forget, if only on occasion, that the parody on display is way too close to reality.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Despelote"><a target="_blank" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2367820/despelote/">Despelote</a> (Julián Cordero/Sebastian Valbuena/Panic)</h2><p>Image via Julián Cordero/Sebastian Valbuena/Panic</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I played the first ten minutes of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Despelote</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> with a knot in my throat. I'm not a soccer fan. I wasn't born in Ecuador, either, which is where the slice-of-life adventure takes place. But as a fellow Latin American, the sense of place that </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Despelote</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> managed to evoke in its first frames was enough to conjure all sorts of memories. A big part of this is the fact that Spanish is the predilect in-game language. It's not the first game to attempt this, but it is the first to actually care about the authenticity of it. With every spoken word, you can sense the pride of a nation. You can sense the pride of the developers releasing a game in 2025 that defies the commercial expectation to succumb to English's hegemony. Instead, it focuses solely on telling a personal story that only we in the Southern Hemisphere can truly understand, and not the other way around.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Lost Records: Bloom and Rage"><a target="_blank" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1902960/Lost_Records_Bloom__Rage/">Lost Records: Bloom and Rage</a> (Don't Nod)</h2><p>Image via Don't Nod</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">All coming-of-age stories are defined by demographics, time periods, and who embodies them. But there's always room to relate and draw parallels from. The latest narrative adventure from the Life is Strange studio, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Lost Records: Bloom and Rage,</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> is a strong example of this, showcasing the perspectives of four young women who reside in a town that couldn't be more different than theirs. The protagonists suffer the hate of the community they grew up in every turn, until they decide they've had enough. Colorful makeup and props, the whirring of an electric guitar, and a desire to break free from oppressors in every sense of the word are enough to fuel a flame—one meant to burn not just the wrongdoings of the town, but also set ablaze the pain and suffering of the past as they embark on a new chapter in their lives, this time stronger together.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="The Hundred Line: Last Defense Academy"><a target="_blank" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3014080/The_Hundred_Line_Last_Defense_Academy/">The Hundred Line: Last Defense Academy</a> (Too Kyo Games/Media.Vision Inc./Aniplex Inc.)</h2><p>Image via Too Kyo Games/Media.Vision Inc./Aniplex Inc.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The Danganronpa and Zero Escape series can be hard to stomach.

By infusing the singular creative energy that has driven past works into one joint experience, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The Hundred Line</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> is both a recurring homage and a gargantuan expression of ambition, featuring a story with 100 endings to pursue.

It's a solid skating game. It's an inspiring narrative game. It's unbashedly creative within its own foundation, too—feeling, looking, and sounding unlike any other game out there. It knows that it's telling its own story, and embraces the rare opportunity to go all-in, paying homage to the skating scene, the city of New York, and to life itself. It doesn't matter if you know how to skate or not. It's just a vehicle to get somewhere. A vehicle for expression. A vehicle to better understand yourself and the streets under your wheels as you part ways with them. So just skate, in both life and death. Eat the moon. Set yourself free.</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Contributing Editor, News, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Diego Nicolás Argüello is a freelance journalist and critic from Argentina.

            <p>Peak developer Aggro Crab has hit back at "friendslop" haters, insisting there's a place for co-op games that "deliver a specific experience", especially as they can be "very cost-effective for indie production".</p>
<p>Talking to <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/co-op/peak-lead-knows-youre-a-friendslop-hater-but-remember-these-games-arent-trying-to-be-game-of-the-year-these-are-games-that-emphasize-teamwork/">GamesRadar+</a>, studio head Nick Kaman said that while these games may "forego traditional quality markers", some players just want to hang out with their friends and have fun – and that's what "friendslop games put [...] at the front and centre of the experience".</p>

<p>"There's backlash because sometimes these games forego traditional quality markers like polished graphics or story, but these games aren't trying to be Game of the Year, they focus on delivering a specific experience and that can make it very cost-effective for indie production," Kaman said.</p><p>While he acknowledges that "like with any hot genre, you get a lot of fast-follows and low-quality attempts flooding the storefronts", he reckons "it's mainly just fun to be a hater, especially when a term like 'friendslop' is so juicy".</p>
<p>"There's a real desire to connect and hang out in online worlds, and friendslop games put that at the front and centre of the experience," Kaman added. "These are games that emphasise teamwork and communication, as opposed to just testing your individual skill in a group setting."</p>
<p>Peak – which follows a string of other multi-million sellers for publisher Landfall, including Content Warning and Totally Accurate Battlegrounds – is available now on Steam. Eurogamer contributing editor <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/budget-steam-smash-hit-peak-is-my-new-gaming-obsession">Christian Donlan called Peak his "new gaming obsession" earlier this year</a>, writing: "Great climbing, great fun, a very pure take on design. And maybe stay away from the mushrooms. Some of them, anyway."</p>
<p>It's been so successful, in fact, that it has spawned so many clones, the team behind <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/smash-hit-co-op-climber-peak-sells-another-million-as-studio-outlines-future-update-plans">indie hit </a>would rather its community <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/peak-developers-would-rather-you-pirate-its-game-than-play-roblox-microtransaction-riddled-ripoff-slop">pirate its own game than play a "microtransaction-riddled" ripoff</a>.</p>

<figure data-uuid="c7905b15e134e"><a title="Strange Antiquities" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/c7905b15e134e/strange-antiquities.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Iceberg Interactive</em></figcaption></figure><p>If you think more games should be about giving cursed skulls to weird strangers, then I'm here to tell you that you're fine, you're normal, you're <em>right</em>, and you should play <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/strange_antiquities">Strange Antiquities</a>.</p>
<p>You may have already played Bad Viking's first game in the 'Strange' series, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/strange_horticulture">Strange Horticulture</a>, a gothically-tinged tale of running a plant shop, but with more than a touch of Lovecraftian business lurking in the shadows. As someone who's a little bored of the more toothless cosy games on the market, I'm always delighted to find something with sinister undercurrents and supernatural goings-on. Also, ritual murder! Not enough cosy games feature ritual murder.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytC1rrCdi_XjA" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067rmhuko&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>841k</span></a></p>

<p>Strange Antiquities might be more of the same after Horticulture, but it's a great formula. People come in, they tell you their woes, and you use your logical and deductive skills to locate the object on your shelves that will solve their problems.</p>
<figure data-uuid="6842ca14e81eb"><a title="Strange Antiquities" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/6842ca14e81eb/strange-antiquities.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Iceberg Interactive</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>The clever thing is that your shelves are filled with a ton of objects that could, potentially, fit the vague description in the book, and it takes careful reading and attention to clues to pick the right one. If you're looking for something made of gold, should you pick the necklace, or the totem? If you need something that represents a lunar goddess, should you pick an item made in her image, or in the shape of the moon? For detective game sickos like me (and you, I bet) who love having to decipher cryptic clues like you're trying to ask Rumpelstiltskin for directions, this is basically catnip.</p>
<p>Strange Antiques also has that rare quality of making the player feel masterful, which is hard to achieve, because the player usually has absolutely <em>zero</em> experience doing whatever it is the game's about. I love <strong>Ace Attorney</strong>, but I know diddly squat about the law, and although I technically have grown vegetables in my real-life garden, my harvest has never been as bountiful or marketable as those I grow in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/stardew_valley">Stardew Valley</a>.</p>
<p>Likewise, I've never been a semi-magical purveyor of arcane goods who occasionally explores graveyards and ruins to find more (although if you see a job posting for that, please send it to me), but Strange Antiquities – with all its reference tomes and maps – makes me feel incredibly competent at the task. A customer comes in, says something unhelpfully ambiguous about their ailment, and waits patiently as I comb through my books, cross-reference them with items, and finally settle on an object to give them.</p>
<figure data-uuid="43c04ae1d9981"><a title="Strange Antiquities" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/43c04ae1d9981/strange-antiquities.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Iceberg Interactive</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>When you're not giving out curios and knicknacks, you're exploring, through Strange Antiquities' concise and clever daily riddles. Some of these riddles are presented as text – "An escaped prisoner ran north-west. He hid me in the first building he came to" – which require you to find a location on a map that corresponds to its clues. In that example, you have to find a prison, trace a line northwest, and find the first building on that line. That one's easy, because it's the first one, but it still has that fulfilling sense of reading between the lines that all good detective games cultivate.</p>
<p>Other riddles are more opaque, providing you with nothing but a shape, and hoping that you'll have studied your maps enough to recognise that it's the outline of a house, or a tombstone, or a room. These puzzles need you to notice subtle details, read between the lines, and cultivate an internal spatial understanding of each area, in order to solve the riddle. Asking players to engage with the world on such an intimate level is genius – it creates a sense of player-directed immersion that adds to that feeling of mastery and ownership.</p>

<p>All of this is to say that, in a year dominated by detective-y puzzle-y games, most of which are not on the Switch (boo), I feel like Strange Antiquities has flown a little under the radar. The much-lauded clique of <strong>Blue Prince</strong>, <strong>The Roottrees are Dead</strong>, <strong>The Drifter</strong>, <strong>The Seance of Blake Manor</strong>, <strong>Type Help</strong>, and the various <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/rise_of_the_golden_idol">Golden Idol</a> add-ons deserve their praise, but Strange Antiquities deserves to be up there on the puzzle podium with them. It's tough when the competition is so stiff!</p>
<p>So, if you're reading this and you enjoy clues and riddles and all that business, give Strange Antiquities a go (plus Strange Horticulture, if you haven't already played it). And then add it to your Game of The Year list, because it's certainly earned a place on mine. And it's not just because a strange shopkeeper gave me a <em>Purified Amulet Of GOTY</em>. I don't think, anyway.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[‘GOG Stands for Freedom, Independence, and Genuine Control’, Says Michał Kiciński, the GOG Co-Founder Who Just Acquired the Digital Store from CD Proj]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/gog-acquired-by-co-founder-from-cd-projekt-red/</link>
            <guid>1393888</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Co-founder of CD Projekt RED and of Good Old Games (GOG), Michał Kiciński, has just acquired the digital storefront from CD Projekt RED. Kiciński, CDPR, and GOG <a href="https://www.gog.com/blog/gog-is-getting-acquired-by-its-original-co-founder-what-it-means-for-you/">announced the news today in a blog post on the official GOG Blog</a>, as Kiciński promises to keep the founding values of GOG at the forefront of how the store operates.</p>



<p>"<em>GOG stands for freedom, independence, and genuine control," </em>Kiciński said. That was the bedrock of the store when Kiciński and Marcin Iwiński founded the store over a decade ago, and that seems to be the same mission statement that is carrying the platform into this new era, as control returns to one of the platform's original co-founders.</p>



<p>"<em>GOG is entering a new chapter. Michał Kiciński</em>, <em>co-founder of CD Projekt and GOG, has acquired GOG from CD Projekt</em>," the platform announced on its <a href="https://x.com/GOGcom/status/2005675068295127375">official X (formerly Twitter) account</a>. "<em>The mission stays the same: Make Games Live Forever. Going back to our roots allows us to double down on what we do best: reviving classics, giving you a library you control rather than one that controls you, and offering the most gamer-friendly policies on the market.</em>" </p>

<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>GOG is entering a new chapter.</p><p>Michał Kiciński, co-founder of CD PROJEKT and GOG, has acquired GOG from CD PROJEKT.</p><p>The mission stays the same: Make Games Live Forever.</p><p>Going back to our roots allows us to double down on what we do best: reviving classics, giving you a library…</p></div>— GOG.COM (@GOGcom) <a href="https://twitter.com/GOGcom/status/2005675068295127375?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 29, 2025</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>In the blog post, an FAQ outlines how players don't have to do or change anything about their account, and that there is essentially no change for them on the user side. "<em>DRM-free is more central to GOG than ever</em>," the blog post reads, and the platform will also maintain its strong relationship with CD Projekt RED and continue to release CDPR games on the platform.</p>



<p>The platform also clarified that it is not in a bad way financially, and for the platform, this move is more about keeping the platform's core values at the forefront and protecting the platform through this independence.</p>



<p>"<em>To us at GOG, this feels like the best way to accelerate what is unique about GOG. Michał Kiciński is one of the people who created GOG around a simple idea: bring classic games back, and make sure that once you purchase a game, you have control over it forever. With him acquiring GOG, we keep long-term backing that is aligned with our values: freedom, independence, control, and making games stay playable over time.</em>"</p>



<p>Altogether, while this acquisition still has a great deal of significance in the fact that one of the more popular digital storefronts for PC players is changing hands, it doesn't feel like a major change at all, considering who it is going to and what will change about the platform going forward. GOG will remain the best place to <a href="https://wccftech.com/dino-crisis-1-and-2-pc-enhancements/">grab older titles through its preservation efforts</a>, to find <a href="https://wccftech.com/fallout-london-is-fastest-redeemed-game-on-gog-gets-new-update/">premium mods like Fallout: London</a>, and the place <a href="https://wccftech.com/santa-ragione-horses-banned-from-epic-games-store-at-last-minute-steam-ban/">where games like Horses can thrive on</a> while other platforms ban it from sale.</p>

Like the company’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/3/24191794/gb-operator-game-boy-camera-webcam-epilogue-nintendo">GB Operator</a> that debuted in early 2021, the SN Operator is a standalone USB cartridge slot that lets you play and archive old Nintendo console games on PCs, Macs, or handhelds like the Steam Deck using their original carts. But where the GB Operator was built for Game Boy, Game Boy Color, and GBA games, the SN Operator instead supports any Super Nintendo and Super Famicom game.</p><p>Preorders for the SN Operator will open at 12PM ET on December 30th for $59.99. That’s $10 more expensive than the smaller <a href="https://www.epilogue.co/product/gb-operator">GB Operator</a>, which will remain available too. The hardware is expected to ship in April 2026.</p><p>The cartridge slot connects to computers or handhelds over USB and works alongside Epilogue’s accompanying <a href="https://www.epilogue.co/downloads">Playback</a> app. The app features a built-in SNES emulator for playing your original cartridges, but you can use other emulators if you already have one you prefer. Games that relied on accessories like Nintendo’s Super NES Mouse or the Super Scope are also compatible with Playback and will use your computer mouse instead of those peripherals.</p><p>On top of new console support, the SN Operator includes another function that should appeal to retro gaming fans with large collections of aging and degrading cartridges. The Playback app can authenticate cartridges so you know for sure if that rare title you found at a flea market is real or a bootleg. It can also create digital copies of your cartridges including their save game data so you can archive your collection and keep on playing where you originally left off, even if your original cartridges stop working. The SN Operator will work with any cartridge that can be played in Nintendo’s original hardware, including bootlegs you accidentally purchased. But Epilogue does specify you should only back up cartridges you own — so no using this to borrow and copy a giant collection from a friend.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTYw"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Andrew Liszewski</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/850793/epilogue-sn-operator-super-nintendo-snes-cartridge-slot-backup-emulator]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/stranger-things-coming-out-scene-will-byers-season-5-2000655961</link>
            <guid>1393867</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/stranger-things-season-5-ghosts-n-goblins-nes-arcade-error-2000649178"><i><span>Stranger Things</span></i></a><span> is nearly over, with its finale set to premiere on </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/netflix-warner-bros-acquisition-batman-hbo-2000651036"><span>Netflix</span></a><span> and in theaters on Wednesday, December 31. Its penultimate episode, “Chapter Seven: The Bridge,” included a scene that was a long time coming: Will (Noah Schnapp) finally coming out to his friends as gay after crushing hard on Mike (Finn Wolfhard). It turns out Will’s identity isn’t merely a footnote on his character sheet, but actually ends up playing a pretty major part in the show’s supernatural horror elements. Now, after years of keeping the truth to himself, Will has finally told all his friends and a few acquaintances who were just kinda around that he is a card-carrying boy liker, and the final scene has received a pretty…mixed response.</span></p> <p><span>So let’s break it down. Will, who has a psychic connection with series big bad Vecna, is in his feelings after finding out the monster has been using him as a spy since he returned from the&nbsp; Upside Down in </span><i><span>Stranger Things</span></i><span>’ first season. He also learns that his connection to this other world created the Upside Down tunnel system that formed underneath Hawkins National Laboratory in season 2, which “infected” the real world and led to the deaths of many innocent people.</span></p>

 <p><span>Later in the episode, he tells his mother about Vecna’s hostile takeover of his mind, and says that the villain sees “everything,” knowing his secrets and preying on his fears. So in order to beat Vecna, Will says he needs to give him one less secret to wield, and wants his friends and family to know the truth.</span></p>

 <p><span>Will sits down with a dozen people of varying importance to him and gives, well, a pretty straightforward coming-out confession of the sort that you’d expect from just about any well-meaning show from the early 2000s. He goes on about how he and all his friends are still the same except for one little detail: “I don’t like girls.” He says that he had a crush on someone he knew wouldn’t like him back, and that Vecna showed him a manufactured future in which this came between him and his friends, not because of bigotry, but because their overbearing worry for him makes him feel othered to the point of pushing them away.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>As Will starts to cry, his mother and friends, one by one, promise that they’re not going anywhere and then give him a big group hug. It’s sweet, but maybe a bit overwrought for modern sensibilities? There’s a lot to unpack about this moment and how it may or may not land.</span></p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">This is so fucking absurd I can’t <a href="https://t.co/XkOJQEhjkL">pic.twitter.com/XkOJQEhjkL</a></p> <p>— َ (@janehopz) <a href="https://twitter.com/janehopz/status/2004430176176984386?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 26, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span>For some, there’s just some absurdity to seeing most of the cast of </span><i><span>Stranger Things </span></i><span>lined up to listen to Will tell everyone he has a crush on another friend in the room, and it also doesn’t help that much of the cast is just not reacting much at all to the revelation. But I don’t think that the silliness of the scene is the only issue.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>By 2025, it feels like some queer people may have become a bit jaded toward the traditional coming-out story. It’s certainly still a universal part of queer experience, but when it’s often the only lens through which mainstream media views the queer experience, a young twink tearfully telling his bros he’s “still the same” as he always was probably isn’t going to land with queer viewers the way it once would have. On the contrary, some queer people don’t find comfort in stories where a gay character only finds solidarity if they focus on how they are the “same” as their cishet friends. I’d rather see stories about that support not being given under the condition of what makes me similar to others, when it should be offered regardless.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>In the case of </span><i><span>Stranger Things</span></i><span>, I think I’m willing to offer it some grace because it is ultimately an ‘80s period piece, and even though the Stonewall Riots happened nearly 20 years prior, there was still a lot of work to be done in 1987. So if 16-year-old Will has no other framework to communicate his truth to his friends in the late ‘80s, fair enough. Especially if there are still young people living in small towns like Hawkins who are watching shows like </span><i><span>Stranger Things</span></i><span> and still at that stage in their lives.</span></p> <p><span>That said, the ‘80s setting does have some fans wondering where the hell this universal acceptance is coming from. Yeah, you could argue the </span><i><span>Stranger Things </span></i><span>gang has been through so much that they don’t have time for homophobia, but when has an apocalypse ever been enough to make a bigot admit to the error of their ways? I don’t know, it’s an awkward line to walk when you’re including queer characters in your story. If you show a completely accepting universe, you run the risk of coming off as inauthentic, but if you portray the reality of the queer experience, you will inevitably have the most online armchair consultant calling your work a moral failing to the gays you hope to represent.

At the very least, the polarizing moment has got the shitpost pipeline flowing.</span></p>

			<p>Five years ago, in the height of the COVID-19 pandemic, a developer known as Crementif started to work on a VR mod so they could cut down trees in the <strong>Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</strong>. After they figured out how to cut down trees in VR in Breath of the Wild, they kept working on it, and that initial idea became <strong>BetterVR</strong>, a full VR mod for Breath of the Wild that will let you experience the expansive world of Hyrule for the first time all over again. Until Nintendo tries to kill it, that is.</p>



<p>A trailer for the mod was released by Crementif and Flat2VR Studios just two days prior to its release today, announcing the mod and showcasing just how impressive it is - and it is incredibly impressive. The mod <a href="https://github.com/Crementif/BotW-BetterVR">is currently available to download</a>, and it works with a copy of Breath of the Wild for the Wii U that has been emulated and can run on your PC through Cemu version 2.6.</p>



<p>Though, as comments on the trailer and everywhere else Crementif's story has been shared point out, you'll want to get your hands on this mod and get it set up before Nintendo tries to kill it with their legal team. </p>

</p></figure>



<p>Nintendo's litigious history is well known, whether <a href="https://wccftech.com/ryujinx-switch-emulator-is-dead-too-taken-down-by-nintendo-like-yuzu/">it is striking down entire emulators</a>, mods <a href="https://wccftech.com/zelda-breath-of-the-wild-multiplayer-mod-creators-attacked-by-nintendo-through-copyright-strikes/">for games like Breath of the Wild</a>, or trying to <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-patent-on-summoning-and-battling-characters-re-examination-by-us-patent-office/">stretch the meaning of a patent to take out major competitors in the industry</a>. It wouldn't be a surprise if Flat2VR Studios and Crementif were contacted by Nintendo soon, if they haven't already.</p>



<p>Of course, Nintendo will not necessarily go after this mod over the scores of mods available for Breath of the Wild - <a href="https://wccftech.com/zelda-breath-of-the-wild-modded-ray-tracing/">like this one that adds ray tracing and makes the eight-year-old game look brand new</a> -  it's just something that's always a concern when projects like this pop up. So, in the meantime, if you have the necessary hardware and know-how to set this mod up for yourself, you'd do well to get it downloaded and ready, just in case something happens to it.</p>
