<p>The remake is supposedly real and currently operating under the codename 'Chamber', which is presumably a blatant reference to protagonist Rebecca Chambers. Voice and performance capture work had reportedly begun in 2024, with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/marvels_guardians_of_the_galaxy_cloud_version">Guardians of the Galaxy</a> actor Jon McLaren taking on a key role.</p>
<p>McLaren's <a href="https://resumes.actorsaccess.com/jonmclaren">resume</a> makes reference to a 'lead' role in 'PROJECT CHAMBER (Upcoming AAA Video Game)' with Beyond Capture Studios, which had also worked with Capcom on the <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/resident_evil_4">Resident Evil 4</a> remake and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/street-fighter-6-years-1-2-fighters-edition">Street Fighter 6</a>. While not a definitive lead at this time, it seems possible that McLaren may be taking on the role of RE0's Billy Coen.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067yultws&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>837k</span></a></p>

<p>Mp1st also goes on to say that "the remake is expected to expand upon the source material, although the core story will remain the same". Pretty standard for RE remakes, as far as we're concerned. They then dive briefly into a couple of potential new scenes, but we won't relay those details here. You can click through to the article if you'd like to find out more.</p>
<p>According to prominent Resident Evil leaker <a href="https://x.com/AestheticGamer1/status/1963192470768128362">Dusk Golem</a>, Capcom's current timeline has a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/resident_evil_code_veronica_x">Resident Evil: Code Veronica</a> remake launching in 2027 with Resident Evil 0 following in 2028. As we know, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/resident-evil-requiem">Resident Evil Requiem</a>, the next mainline entry in the seres, will launch on Switch 2 on <strong>27th February 2026</strong>.</p>
<p>As always, we won't treat this as gospel until Capcom itself provides official confirmation. If the timeline is even remotely accurate, it's likely we won't hear about Resident Evil 0 for a couple of years, at least.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p><span>The new PlayStation 5 Pro CFI-7121 model, no</span>w available across Europe, comes with some improvements over the original model, a new teardown conducted by&nbsp;Austin Evans&nbsp;confirmed.</p>



<p>The most significant difference between the PlayStation 5 Pro launch model and the CFI-7121 model is better power efficiency for the 2025 model. In tests conducted running Astro's Playroom and Gran Turismo 7, the CFI-7121 model proved to be 2 to 3% more power efficient, even running replays in Gran Turismo 7 which push the system the most with full ray tracing support. Thanks to the better power efficiency, the new system also runs slightly cooler than 2024's launch model.</p>



<p>The CFI-7121 model is also noticeably quieter. In the tests, the new unit proved to be 20% quieter than the launch model, representing a 2-decibel difference. The new fan's slightly lower-pitched sound profile further enhances this reduction.</p>



<p>The differences between the two PlayStation 5 Pro models are minimal for the rest. Changes like slightly different fan from another manufacturer, a plastic fan grid in place of a metal grid, a lighter rear heat sink, the removal of some VMMs from the motherboard and a lighter, possibly more efficient power supply, result not only in the enhanced power efficiency, but also in a lighter weight - 3016 grams against the 3103 grams of the launch model.</p>



<p>The changes for the new DualSense controller revision are even smaller. Aside from some small internal changes and parts produced by a different manufacturer than those in a launch controller, the new DualSense only saw the removal of the back microphone. This is a rather small change likely made to keep manufacturing costs down without significantly impacting the controller's performance and functionality.</p>



<p>You can see the full breakdown of these hardware changes, including the fan and heatsink revisions, in Austin Evans' complete teardown video below.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>While it was expected that the new PlayStation 5 Pro model would be <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-playstation-5-pro-hardware-revision-is-rumored-to-launch-in-europe-this-month/">around 3% more power efficient than the launch model</a>, the new DualSense V3 controller revision is minimal, <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-playstation-5-pro-hardware-revision-is-rumored-to-launch-in-europe-this-month/">which is not what earlier reports suggested earlier this month</a>. While this may be disappointing for some, the fact that the changes made to the controller don't impact its functionality and keep its price down should still be welcome amidst consistent price increases that have made both<a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-price-increased/"> the regular PlayStation 5 </a>and the<a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-series-x-s-prices-will-reportedly-go-up-again-in-us-microsoft/"> Xbox Series X|S systems more expensive</a> since their launch in 2020.</p>

              <p>Halloween is a great time to catch up on some Wizarding World magic, or even better, bring your favorite moments home. Lego has quite a few Harry Potter sets for the fans out there, and right now, you can pick one up for less.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4867/">The Harry Potter Hagrid’s Hut: An Unexpected Visit set is currently going for just $47 on Amazon, after a steep 37% off its regular price of $75</a>. This is the lowest we have seen this set drop to in a long while, but the deal is going to wrap up soon. Whether you’re treating yourself to some weekend fun or introducing your kids to the classics, now’s the time to jump in.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4867/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Build Both the Insides and Outdoors</h2>
<p>This set gets you a total of 896 pieces, and it’s designed for children ages 8 and up. You will build Hagrid’s cozy hut, plus the dog house. The hut itself opens up and has a removable roof. The insides have Hagrid’s foldout chair, an umbrella stand, and even a dragon egg. There are also two collectible Hogwarts portrait tiles, which are randomly selected from a set of 14. You can display these inside Hagrid’s hut, or add them to your collection if you’re building one.</p>
<p>Mini figures include Harry Potter, Hermione Granger, Ron Weasley, Draco Malfoy, and Hagrid, along with Norbert the dragon and Hagrid’s Dog Fang. You can recreate multiple scenes; maybe have Hagrid relax on his chair inside, while the curious kids look for trouble, or have them all outside preparing to fight the unknown.</p>



<p>The set comes with a detailed instruction book that takes you through each step one by one. If that sounds too complicated, you can also download the Lego app on your phone for 3D instructions. You can also track your progress through the app to get started right where you left off.</p>
<p>Altogether, this set is a great option if you want to keep some of your favorite Harry Potter memories close. It’s not just fun to build, but also a little nostalgic, especially for those who grew up watching the movies. The mini figure selection is impressive; you’re getting most of the key characters. You could treat yourself to it, or gift it to a fellow fan this Halloween! Just be sure to grab the set fast, as we don’t expect this offer to last long. It could wrap up anytime now.</p>

            <p>Xbox president Sarah Bond has confirmed Microsoft is working on "next-gen hardware", following rumours it was no longer in console development.</p>
<p>Bond spoke with <a href="https://variety.com/2025/digital/news/xbox-ally-handheld-release-president-sarah-bond-interview-1236555575/">Variety</a> to mark the release of the new handheld ROG Xbox Ally, but was also asked about the future of Xbox.</p>

<p>Rumours had been circulating on social media that Microsoft would no longer be developing console hardware, rumours which began shortly after the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-increases-price-of-xbox-game-pass-ultimate-despite-record-subscription-profits-last-year">price hike to Xbox Game Pass Ultimate</a>.</p>
<p>It certainly appeared to tie in with not only the forthcoming release of the new handheld in collaboration with Asus, but with Microsoft's own campaign slogan of "<a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2024/11/14/this-is-an-xbox/">This is an Xbox</a>" and a mission to ensure its games are available on multiple platforms.</p>
<p>Yet this statement from Bond confirms hardware remains in the pipeline.</p>
<p>"We want to make sure that people have a choice," Bond told Variety. "We want to make sure there's an option for the power players who want the latest innovations, that want to push the edge of what's possible, the most demanding players. And then, if someone is looking for PC gaming on the go, they're a casual gamer, they're a gaming enthusiast, then there's Xbox Allys for them. Giving multiple choices for people, so we can actually meet people where they are."</p>
<p>That said, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xboxs-new-rog-ally-handheld-now-available-to-pre-order-but-its-pricier-than-a-home-console">steep price of the handheld</a> suggests it's not particularly suited to casual gamers either.</p>
<p>Eurogamer's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rog-xbox-ally-x-review">ROG Xbox Ally X review</a> from Tom Orry states it's "an impressive handheld PC wearing an Xbox mask". Eurogamer's Alex Donaldson, meanwhile, has been <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/whatever-it-is-the-rog-xbox-ally-x-makes-me-pine-for-xboxs-distant-heyday">pining instead for Xbox's "distant heyday"</a>.</p>
<p>There's certainly been some confusion over the messaging from Xbox recently and speculation on its future, which hasn't been helped by the Game Pass price hike following <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/perfect-dark-reboot-and-new-zenimax-mmorpg-reportedly-cancelled-as-part-of-latest-microsoft-cuts">multiple game cancellations</a> off the back of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-xbox-layoffs-june-2025-tracking-the-situation-as-it-happens">mass layoffs</a>.</p>

It's predictably called Futurama: Hit &amp; Run and has a demo out now.</p>
<p>For free, of course, so attempts to deploy the 'shut up and take my money' meme here are thoroughly misplaced. If you've already said it while reading that first paragraph, please submit to death by snu-snu. No wait, that makes it sound like I'm going to be the one doing the-</p>

<p>Getting back on track, <a href="https://modbakery.donutteam.com/projects/view/48">Futurama: Hit &amp; Run</a> devs Slurm Team's recreation of New New York consists of new 3D models built "from scratch". There are four fresh story missions to sink your teeth into while playing as formerly freezered delivery boy Fry, plus a bonus mission. Naturally, the 30th century also has three new street races and a wager-based one. Prepare to eat some dust, pantless space ranger Zapp Brannigan.</p><p>There are six cars with which to bump cartoon pedestrians into t-posey ragdoll falls. four costumes to don, and 25 wasps to awkwardly jump-kick. Amusingly, the modders specify that their work contains exactly ten side-gags, including one elusive secret gag to hunt down. I assume all of them are buttons you press so that Ralph Wiggum says a thing, as all Hit and Run jokes should be.</p>
<p>It's worth noting that while a full custom soundtrack's up and running, Slurm Team have made clear they've used "AI-generated dialogue as temporary placeholders" in the demo. "Please note that these synthetic voices are included solely for demonstration purposes," the modders wrote. "Professional voice artists are already engaged, and their recordings will replace the placeholder content in a future update."</p>
<p>Personally, I think I'll wait for that update to materialise before I think about giving the mod a go (I'll also need to acquire a non-PS2 copy of Hit &amp; Run). In a fun twist, the trailer's seemingly caught the eye of <a href="https://www.mobygames.com/person/97899/joe-mcginn/">Joe McGinn</a>, a senior game designer on the original, and he's left a comment indicating he's keen to try the mod out.</p>
<p>To get Futurama: Hit &amp; Run hit and running, you'll need a copy of Hit &amp; Run for PC, plus <a href="https://modbakery.donutteam.com/projects/view/6">Lucas' Simpsons Hit &amp; Run Mod Launcher</a>.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/apple%E2%80%99s-clearing-out-airtag-4-pack-before-black-friday-practically-free-at-this-price.1329280/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>There are times buying in bulk is a super smart move, and then there are times when you wonder if filling your basement with 600 buckets of survivalist food was really worth the money. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3844/">This Amazon deal, thankfully, is one of the super smart moves, since it’s offering you a 4-pack of Apple AirTags for just $65</a>, just half a buck more than the all-time low price for a 4-pack. The math says that nets out to $16.25 per tracker tag, while the price of an individual AirTag at Amazon is $25 even while it’s also on sale.</p>
<p>Considering just how many uses there are for AirTags, buying just one would be a little odd to begin with. Even if you travel with just one carry-on bag, your backpack, purse, or wallet would benefit from an AirTag as well. And there are so many third-party AirTag holders available now that you can track anything from your car keys to your cat. (No, really,&nbsp;<em>your cat</em>.) Finding uses for four AirTags is a cinch.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3844/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Simply the Best</h2>
<p>If you’re an iPhone or iPad user, you absolutely cannot beat the AirTag for keeping track of your stuff. With one-tap setup, the AirTag goes from unboxing to fully running and linked to as many as five users in minutes. The disc shape and compact size mean you can put it basically anywhere, either with one of those specially designed keychains, wallets, or other holders, or just loose if you’re placing it in a suitcase or backpack.</p>
<p>When it’s time to call upon the AirTag to locate a lost item, it gets the job done whether the missing object is wedged between the couch cushions mere inches away from you, or if it’s thousands of miles away. In close range, you can use the Find My app to have the tag play a sound for you to locate, or use the app to lead you to the AirTag with accurate measurements down to the foot. At long range, the millions-strong Find My network can locate your AirTag and show its current location, even if it’s on the other side of the world.</p>



<h2>Safety All Around</h2>
<p>Not only is the ability to quickly locate a missing item a good safety feature, there’s also the fact that even the Find My network is deployed to help find your missing item, it’s done with complete anonymity. The whole network is encrypted for privacy, and the AirTags themselves never store location data or history.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3844/">This Amazon deal on a 4-pack of Apple AirTags for just $65 comes at a great time</a>, probably just as you’re thinking about or actively planning your holiday travel. It’s a great price and a small investment for the ability to track not only your own stuff, but also to help keep tabs on the family’s bags as you brave the holiday crowds.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Ninja Gaiden 4 is anything but a pushover. Team Ninja has once again concocted another brutal affair, sure to have you pulling out your hair for hours. If you’re wondering how many hours exactly, we can run through Ninja Gaiden 4’s game length and expected playtime for you.</p>



<p>Team Ninja finally returned to its legendary franchise after a few years away. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ninja-gaiden-4-release-date-start-times/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ninja Gaiden 4</a> carries on Ryu Hayabusa’s journey and brings back the PTSD instilled by over 30 years of almost hilariously difficult NG games. Don’t get it twisted, we welcome the challenge, and NG games offer a level of challenge not even some Souls games can match!</p>



<p>Ninja Gaiden 4 looks to be a violent return to form. If you’re curious as to how much content is in the game, we’ve got all the answers you need.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-many-hours-to-beat-ninja-gaiden-4">How Many Hours To Beat Ninja Gaiden 4?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>How long can you endure? Credit to Team Ninja</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Team Ninja Director Masakazu Hirayama has said an initial playthrough on normal difficulty should take you “15 to 20 hours.”</strong></p>



<p>Firstly, Ninja Gaiden 4 on a ‘normal’ difficulty is the equivalent of other games essentially being on hard—on steroids. Your mileage will vary when it comes to Hirayama’s window—through <a href="https://next-play.com.au/ninja-gaiden-4-hands-on-preview-and-development-team-interview-meeting-yakumo-ryus-return-new-weapons-dlc-plans-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">NextPlay</a>. If you’re well-versed in hack ‘n’ slash games and used to the difficulty of every combat encounter, then this is a realistic timeframe.</p>



<p>If you’re unfamiliar with Ninja Gaiden and intense action games such as these, your runtime might lean toward the 20-hour window, and <em>beyond</em>. Whereas if you make use of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/new-ninja-gaiden-4-gameplay-trailer-shows-off-disgusting-levels-of-difficulty/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">NG 4’s difficulty settings</a>, you might even clock in at just under 15 hours!</p>



<p>There’s plenty of choice.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-long-is-a-ninja-gaiden-4-full-completionist-run">How Long is a Ninja Gaiden 4 Full Completionist Run?</h2>



<p><strong>A completionist run of Ninja Gaiden 4 could feasibly take you 50-100 hours-plus, and there’s a good chance that most people will never be able to complete Ninja Gaiden 4 at all!</strong></p>



<p>If we’re talking about doing everything in Nnja Gaiden 4, this means beating all the extra Missions, Challenges, achieving full weapon mastery, and beating all difficulty levels.</p>



<p>The reason this can take upwards of 100 hours—borderline until the end of time itself—is because of Master Ninja mode. If you go through the full <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ninja-gaiden-4-trophy-list/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ninja Gaiden 4 trophy list</a>, you’ll see that “Way of the Master Ninja” requires you to “Complete the game on MASTER NINJA difficulty.”</p>



<p>If this is anything like previous games, expect enemies to kill you in barely any hits, insta-kill you with grab attacks, and attack you whilst you’re attacking other enemies—and even if you’re in the air! It’s beyond brutal. It’s sadistic, but a sickeningly good time for Ninja Gaiden enthusiasts.</p>



<p>Please, please let us know if you intend to do everything. Have you beaten any Ninja Gaiden games on Master Ninja difficulty (or the equivalent setting) in the past? Now’s the time to brag through the <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1416770944961220720/1416780218936463463" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Discord</a>.</p>

                <p>It's been an interesting month at Ubisoft, as the vice president executive producer of Assassin's Creed, Marc-Alexis Côté, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-boss-leaves-ubisoft-after-two-decades/1100-6535413/">left the company after nearly two decades</a>, and Côté made it clear that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-boss-says-ubisoft-asked-me-to-step-aside/1100-6535519/" data-ref-id="1100-6535519">it wasn't his choice to leave</a>.

                <p>Halo fans are eagerly awaiting the Halo World Championships later this week, where <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/we-know-when-the-next-halo-project-will-be-revealed/1100-6535523/" data-ref-id="1100-6535523">new details about the next Halo game</a> will be revealed. Now, a new report suggests that there are actually two Halo games coming in 2026 for the franchise's 25th anniversary, and one of those titles may be a live-service game.</p><p>According to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O4dWoH0Pa0E" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Rebs Gaming</a>, Halo Studios is working on "a live-service long-term updating [Halo] multiplayer game," before adding, "Its live-service component is like Fortnite." The report didn't offer any other specifics about the gameplay, but went on to add some comments about the way AI is used in the game's creation.</p><p>"Generative AI is apparently woven into every aspect of development, such as enemy AI and terrain generation. I think what they're mostly doing is that and then touching up the work with human hands. Also, developers are expected to meet similar or quicker deadlines and the only means to do so is through the use of AI, whether that's mundane tasks like scheduling things or writing emails all the way up to actual game development."</p><p>This part of the report went viral, which prompted Windows Central executive editor Jez Corden to respond.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://twitter.com/jezcorden/status/1979983889851396518?s=46" data-has-image="false"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">Halo is not using generative AI in its game dev / art assets, etc. for its next game. <br>Microsoft has no mandate on studios to use generative AI for games. <br>I'm sure it's being used for emails n shit like that but they're not making a gen AI game here.</p>  — Jez (@JezCorden) <a href="https://twitter.com/JezCorden/status/1979983889851396518?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 19, 2025</a></blockquote>              </div><p>Rebs Gaming later clarified his initial report.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://twitter.com/Mr_Rebs_/status/1979666123747463470" data-has-image="false"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">Many people are misinterpreting what I reported as if it directly confirms AI is being used in all the wrong ways and Halo is doomed.

Halo: Combat Evolved was previously remastered in 2011. However, the new version is reportedly using a hybrid engine that combines Unreal Engine 5 and the Halo Reach Engine.

The play test peaked at 189,668 concurrent players, and stayed in the top ten most played Steam games all weekend.</p><p>The weekend's open play test was designed as a stress test for the game's servers ahead of its official release on October 30, and it looks like the studio got what it was looking for. The test involved just one map, the Dam Battleground, and allowed players to try out the game's progression, crafting, and quest mechanics.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> ARC Raiders | Release Date Reveal Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>Arc Raiders is being developed by Embark Studios, who were also behind 2023 arena shooter The Finals. Embark was founded by a number of industry veterans, including former Battlefield executive Patrick Soderlund. While The Finals was released as a free-to-play title, Arc Raiders is following the premium model and will release with a $40 price tag.</p><p>Arc Raiders is a PvPvE extraction shooter set in a post-apocalyptic future where humanity has been forced to shelter underground after deadly Arc robots have taken over the surface. The player takes on the role of the titular raider, venturing topside to collect valuable resources. Players have generally had good things to say about the playtest across <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pcgaming/comments/1o9ng4s/arc_raiders_just_became_steams_most_popular/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">social media</a>, praising the game's level of polish pre-release, and the implementation of its strong PvE threats.</p><p>Arc Raiders is launching into a busy period for shooters--Battlefield 6 had its <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-is-already-doing-huge-numbers-on-steam/1100-6535398/" data-ref-id="1100-6535398">massively successful</a> release on October 10, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-2025-everything-we-know-about-rumored-black-ops-2-sequel/1100-6529073/" data-ref-id="1100-6529073">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 is due out</a> in November. Arc Raiders' main competition in the extraction shooter genre, Escape from Tarkov, is also gearing up for its full version 1.0 release on November 15.</p><p>Arc Raiders will be <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/arc-raiders-is-locked-and-loaded-for-an-october-launch/1100-6532163/" data-ref-id="1100-6532163">released on October 30</a> for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox One.</p>

<p>It's no screenshot button, mind</p>

<figure data-uuid="e4eb2c32faacd"><a title="Nintendo Today" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/e4eb2c32faacd/nintendo-today.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/mobile/nintendo_today">Nintendo Today!</a> has scored a tiny update, pushing the app up to ver. 2.0.10 with the addition of a brand new share button.</p>
<p>Yep, a share button. It's hardly the most groundbreaking fresh feature, but considering how the company previously <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/05/nintendo-today-update-prevents-users-from-recording-promotional-videos">removed the ability to take in-app screenshots</a> or nab screen recordings, it's a welcome one.</p>
<p>You'll find the new share button in the bottom right corner of any news item in the app. Giving it a tap will bring up your phone's usual share screen, giving you the chance to spread the news directly to another app via a link.</p>
<p>As you might expect, the patch notes are pretty short for this one, but here they are, nonetheless:</p>
<h2>Nintendo Today Ver. 2.0.10 (20th Oct 2025)</h2>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Share news<br></strong>You can tap the Share Button within Nintendo Today! news content to share it.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Nintendo continues to roll out both major and minor announcements via the Nintendo Today! app. Most of the time, it's a piece of key art or a closer look at a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/kirby-air-riders">Kirby Air Riders</a> vehicle, but then sometimes we'll be surprised with the announcement of a new game like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/splatoon-raiders">Splatoon Raiders</a> or an exclusive peek at a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/10/nintendo-updates-animated-short-film-close-to-you-with-some-familiar-faces">short film</a>. Hey, maybe this share button will come in handy after all!</p>

            <p>Is that you, RPS readership? It's me, Edwin. I'm back from last week's unscheduled spell of Maw mastication, and regrettably, I still have possession of all my typing fingers. James was kind enough to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/this-week-in-pc-games-next-fest-demo-excess-and-double-fines-sentient-lighthouse">do the round-up post in my absence</a>, but the experience has clearly taken a toll, as he is now in India. James, if I fled to another country everytime the Maw ate a colleague I'd have run out of other countries to flee to. But hey, knock yourself out. It's not like there are any big brands getting fresh instalments this week. It's not like... oh good gravy.

<h2>Monday 20th October
</h2>
<p>All maw-wranglers to battlestations! Here comes <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1560160/ILA_A_Frosty_Glide/">ILA: A Frosty Glide</a>, a teeny open world affair featuring a young witch-in-training. Don't be fooled by Ila's apple-cheeked smile and carefree broom-surfing. She's just trying to distract you from the horrors descending from behind.
</p>
<h2>Tuesday 21st October
</h2>
<p>Eek, get your katana out of my neck, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/ninja-gaiden-4">Ninja Gaiden 4</a>! Can't you see I'm trying to free my ankle from the jaws of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/jurassic-world-evolution-3">Jurassic World Evolution 3</a>? Go play Rock Shuriken Shotgun with the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2300120/Painkiller/">Painkiller</a> remake while I check out this neat and relatively non-corpo <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2053910/Isopod_A_Webbed_Spinoff/">isopod platformer</a> recommended by Mark. Who's that rattling the doorknob? <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2">Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2</a>? A likely story. There's no such thing as Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2. There are only Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2 delay announcements.
</p>
<h2>Wednesday 22nd October</h2>
<p>The onslaught thins! Let's take a minute to play <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dispatch">Dispatch</a>, the Telltale-style superhero workplace comedy, and possibly break the crust on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3882020/Avernum_4_Greed_and_Glory/">Avernum 4: Greed and Glory</a>, the latest CRPG from the genre stalwarts at Spiderweb. There's also internet horror phantasm <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2349570/onewayexe_Module_10/">oneway.exe</a>, which was supposed to come out a couple of weeks ago, and bunny-hopping psycho-platformer <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3457940/FUNKYHEART/">Funkyheart</a>.
</p>
<h2>Thursday 23rd October
</h2>
<p>I open the window and am promptly blasted across my flat by a jet of water. It must be <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/powerwash-simulator-2-1">Powerwash Simulator 2</a>. The water covers the lawn outside, which disgorges a wrathful bouquet of rapid-firing daffodils. It must be Popcap remake <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3654560/Plants_vs_Zombies_Replanted/">Plant vs Zombies: Replanted</a>. I flee the building in panic, and am clotheslined at the corner by <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3012220/Double_Dragon_Revive/">Double Dragon Revive</a>. When I wake, I've been isekaied to the menacing France of <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1919900/Dreamed_Away/">Dreamed Away</a>, where I sample exactly one minigame before getting flattened by an <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1880620/Once_Upon_A_KATAMARI/">enormous katamari</a>.
</p>
<h2>Friday 24th October
</h2>
<p>We made it to Friday. Finally, there is time. Time to sit on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-bench">The Bench</a> and feed the pigeons. Time to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3905630/Tower_Lords/">build towers</a>, idly. I won't end the week by running off to India like that lily-livered James, but I might pay a quick recuperative visit to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3566840/Bleak_Haven/">Bleak Haven</a>. They wouldn't have called it a "haven" if it weren't wholesome. I refuse to look up "bleak" in the dictionary.
</p><p>Do you have your eye on any particular games out this week? If I have embarrassingly neglected to mention a major release, please respect my chronic shortage of self-esteem and give me no sign. With James away, it's just me and Mark cranking the handles of non-guides editorial till Friday, plus evening freelance news from Oisin, so there might be the odd break in postage. Hope things are good at your end.</p>

IGN has contacted IO Interactive for more.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/10/20/gettyimages-2239353784-1760954344089.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Lana Del Rey.

"Sam, you did a wonderful job. One day, maybe...

It offered the final chance to play Embark Studios' extraction shooter ahead of its October 30 release date.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">On Steam, Arc Raiders hit a peak concurrent player count of 189,668, making it one of the most-played games on Valve’s platform over the weekend. That's enough to make Arc Raiders the biggest extraction shooter ever on Steam. Escape from Tarkov might have something to say about that when it finally launches on Steam in November, however.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Arc Raiders' true peak concurrent player number across all platforms will be higher than the Steam figure, but neither Epic, Sony, nor Microsoft make their numbers public.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Still, 190,000 on Steam for an open beta is very strong. Not Battlefield 6 strong — its open beta peaked with more than half a million players in August — but certainly strong enough to suggest Arc Raiders has a decent chance of making an impression on the gaming landscape at the end of the month.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Server Slam let players test the Dam Battlegrounds map for a hands-on experience with elements of the game’s progression, crafting, and quest systems. It was designed to help Embark "challenge and fortify the game’s servers before launch," which hopefully means everything will work as it should on release day. All participants earned an exclusive 'Server Slammer' backpack cosmetic reward, unlocked when the full game launches. Progress from the Server Slam does not carry over, however.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Embark Studios' previous game, free-to-download competitive shooter The Finals, is still going, although its concurrent player numbers on Steam are a far cry from those during its explosive launch back in December 2023.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.

            <p>Sonic Team boss Takashi Iizuka wants to continue the trend of spotlighting different Sonic characters each year, following the success of the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sega-declares-2024-the-year-of-shadow-the-hedgehog">Year of Shadow</a>.</p>
<p>Shadow the Hedgehog was celebrated last year to build anticipation for the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/sonic-hedgehog-3">Sonic the Hedgehog 3</a> film, alongside the release of Sonic x Shadow Generations.</p>
<p>It seems this was a success for Sega. In an interview at the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGVWVq8cJPI">Brasil Game Show</a> earlier this month (thanks <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/10/sonic-teams-boss-wants-to-put-more-sonic-characters-in-the-spotlight">NintendoLife</a>), Iizuka stated he'd like a new theme each year, based on characters in future films.</p>

<figure>
<p>
<a aria-label="Sonic the Hedgehog 3: Official Trailer 2" data-platform="youtube" href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1-1AqB9hOCw?autoplay=1" onclick="((e) => { e.preventDefault(); e.currentTarget.closest('.video_wrapper').innerHTML = e.currentTarget.querySelector('template').innerHTML; enableElements(); })(event)" title="Click to play video from YouTube">

</a>
</p>
<figcaption>Sonic the Hedgehog 3: Official Trailer 2<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1-1AqB9hOCw" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>


<p>"Last year, we promoted The Year of Shadow, influenced by the movie, but I'd like to choose a theme each year and spotlight different characters," said Iizuka. "I think we can predict which characters will appear in the upcoming movie, so I'd like those characters to play an active role."</p>
<p>A <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sonic-the-hedgehog-4-film-sequel-on-the-way">Sonic the Hedgehog 4 film has already been greenlit</a>, announced shortly after the release of the third film last year. A <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sonic-the-hedgehog-4-movie-gets-a-release-date-but-its-still-a-few-years-away">release date was then provided</a> shortly after: 19th March 2027.</p>
<p>What's more (<strong>spoiler warning!</strong>), the post-credits scene in Sonic the Hedgehog 3 reveals that Amy Rose and Metal Sonic will appear in the new film - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/whats-next-for-the-sonic-films-after-sonic-the-hedgehog-3s-post-credits-scene">could it be based on Sonic CD</a>?</p>
<p>Perhaps, then, we could see a Year of Amy celebration to build hype for the next film. Could whatever's coming after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/sonic-frontiers">Sonic Frontiers</a> be included?</p>
<p>And could other Sonic characters feature in future? The Year of Big the Cat? The Year of Cream the Rabbit?</p>
<p>This year, Sega has a <a href="https://www.sega.com/sonic-the-hedgehog/racing-around-the-world">Racing Around The World</a> campaign to celebrate the release of Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds. That resulted in a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sonic-joins-mclaren-racing-in-historic-partnership-with-sega">collaboration with the McLaren Racing team</a>, among other events.</p>

			<p>We’re nearly a decade on from <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2016/05/24/lumo-review/">the original Lumo</a>, a game that, while it was clearly filled with love for old school isometric puzzling, came up a little short. Lumo 2 looks to better that game, bringing greater fidelity, new tricks and genres, and with hundreds more rooms and puzzles, platforming and adventuring.</p>
<p><iframe title="A Love Letter to the Golden Age of Gaming - Lumo 2 - Coming 17th October" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/McB44aIx8sc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>You can immediately appreciate that Lumo 2 is more detailed and visually varied than its predecessor, drawing on many more influences for its rooms and minigames, from puzzles that requiring perspective shifts to genre inserts like a side-scrolling shooter. There is no doubt Lumo 2 is a homage to the 8-bit era as a whole, with references to a lot of different games, many of which I admit passed me by, and is clearly intent on honouring the developers who pioneered those games.</p>



<p>The world of Lumo 2 is split into three distinct areas, one in space, one in a desert, and one in a spooky castle. In each of these worlds the main point is to collect the scattered paint to fill the cauldron related to that world back at the hub area, and to do this you need to explore every nook and cranny. You will start with a fixed view of rooms and can only move to where the camera allows you to see, but borrowing from the metroidvania, exploration will eventually unlock a double jump and ability to rotate the camera, offering new perspectives in rooms and showing new paths to take. You will also have a light for your wand which when lit will show hidden paths and doorways.</p>

<p>Puzzles can be fairly simple to overcome, or be much more complex and require precise timing to land on platforms and avoid obstacles. In the original Lumo, platforming was clunky and inaccurate. Unfortunately, the same applies to Lumo 2. The jump is just a bit too floaty, and there’s only a light hint of a drop shadow to show where you might land, and even that isn’t always accurate.&nbsp;It got to a point where in some rooms I was questioning my own depth perception (which according to my optician is fine), seeing the wizard missing platforms that he should have landed on. It is most frustrating in rooms with moving platforms where misjumps have you dropping down, and that could mean in some rooms falling to a lower level and trying to find your way back. There is no map in Lumo 2, so your choices are to memorise the layout or draw it out.</p>

<p>The wizard’s movement is also a bit slow. It isn’t that noticeable in the smaller rooms, but in wide open areas the running speed seems incredibly sluggish as you move between the puzzles. This really does drag down the experience, and combined with the inaccurate and frustrating platforming,</p>
<p>Lumo 2 becomes a game you are fighting against to play through, instead of taking in the various inspirations and nods that inspired the game. And that is part of the disappointment, because Lumo 2 really shines when it throws non-platforming levels at you, and you can absolutely feel the love and joy that was put into those creations. If this was a collection of minigames that you jumped between without the platforming, Lumo 2 would be fantastic.</p>

		<p>Summary</p><p>
		Nine years on from the original, Lumo 2 writes another love letter to 80s gaming. While it branches out from isometric gaming with its many enjoyable diversions and asides, they're connected by too many rooms and sections that suffer from your sluggish movement and imprecise platforming.	</p></div>

			<p>Fromsoftserve, the developer behind the Bloodborne PC Remaster project, is fixing one of the PlayStation 4 release's most significant graphical shortcomings, making the emulated version of the game the definitive way to experience the FromSoftware action RPG.</p>



<p>In a new video shared on YouTube, the project's developer confirmed they have figured out how to replace the low quality distant meshes that Bloodborne uses frequently to optimize performance on PlayStation 4. </p>



<p>At 1080p resolution and with the vanilla game's depth of field, these low-quality meshes are hardly noticeable, but at higher resolution on PC, they definitely are. As even <a href="https://wccftech.com/bloodborne-60-fps-4gb-vram-rx-580/">low-end machines have no trouble running the game with solid performance</a>, there's no need for these low-quality meshes anymore, which are being replaced with the full-fat version of the model. Judging from the video, the results promise to be stunning, enhancing the haunting beauty of Yarnham's central locations considerably with enhanced detail.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>When these improvements will be added to the Bloodborne PC Remaster project has yet to be determined. However, those who wish to experience the game developed by FromSoftware with a slew of visual improvements can <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/bloodborne/mods/45?tab=files">download the project's current version from Nexus Mods. </a></p>



<p>The latest version of the project, version 0.93, was released on October 14 to restore baked lighting for better visuals while retaining some of the project's best improvements, including dynamic shadows. For a game relying so much on its eerie atmosphere, these additions vastly improve the Bloodborne PC experience made possible by the <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/shadps4/">ShadPS4 PlayStation 4 emulator.</a></p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth-tgs-2025-qa-no-dlc-rebirth-but-theres-a-chance-for-part-3/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Amid the busy halls of the Makuhari Messe during this year’s Tokyo Game Show, we were able to carve out a brief fifteen minutes to talk with Final Fantasy VII Rebirth Director Naoki Hamaguchi as Square-Enix was showing off the <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-remake-trilogy-coming-to-nintendo-switch-2-xbox-square-enix/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">upcoming Nintendo Switch 2 and Xbox Series S|X releases of the first title in the Final Fantasy VII Remake trilogy</a>. With questions being handled through an interpreter, we might not have gotten time to answer everything we wanted to know about the upcoming releases, but we were able to touch on some of the bigger questions on our readers’ minds.<a href=""></a></p>



<p><strong>In a <a href="https://jpgames.de/2025/09/final-fantasy-director-hofft-dass-ihr-game-key-cards-eines-tages-moegen-koennt">recent interview</a>, you talked about how Final Fantasy VII Rebirth will be on a Game Key Card rather than a physical cartridge. Do you see Nintendo ever increasing the speeds on these Nintendo Switch 2 cartridges so that this would not be a requirement in the future?</strong></p>



<p>Personally, I feel that the loading speed issue for the game cartridge is more about the hardware spec of the Nintendo Switch 2. I’m not with Nintendo, so I can’t really speak to that side. That said, I do feel that the Game Key Card format that Nintendo created for the Nintendo Switch 2 is a really amazing new idea that they had offered for us.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I don’t personally see Nintendo working towards trying to improve the loading speed for the cartridges. Rather, I feel that Nintendo will put more effort into popularizing the Game Key Card format which again is a really fantastic idea for us developers. Also, we hope players familiarize themselves with what that costs them. That obviously is something we can help out with as well, from the developer side.</p>



<p>I think that the collaborative effort between Nintendo and publishers trying to promote the Game Key Card will be the best way forward for all players in the future.</p>



<p><strong>These new versions of Final Fantasy VII Remake have several accessibility options, like Easy mode or infinite health, available through the <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-remake-dev-streamlined-progression-players-should-have-choice/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Streamlined Progression feature</a>. Are these in reaction to the original release's too-difficult reception?</strong></p>



<p>Those features are not really about balancing the game. We’re actually quite confident about that because we did fine-tuning until the very end of development, so I think the balance itself is very good.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The reason why we wanted to implement those features is to address the way modern audiences play video games being so diversified these days. Originally, with console video games, people would play on their TV in the living room, then we saw more players playing in their bedroom or on a PC. Now, we also see more players on handheld devices outdoors. In general, the way people approach and play video games is just so diverse, so we wanted to bring an idea that reflects that. It’s not just the way you play games in general, but we wanted to bring a diversified way to play <em>our</em> games, which is why we implemented those features.</p>



<p><strong>Would you ever consider developing a mobile version of the Final Fantasy VII trilogy?</strong></p>



<p>Obviously, we do want to bring our games to a wider audience. When we look at the market landscape of the mobile side, particularly iPhone and Android users, we don’t really feel that there’s quite the demand to justify us creating a mobile port of the Final Fantasy VII Remake project. If there is a demand, we would definitely want to look forward to hearing that.</p>



<p>As of this moment, I don’t think the demand is quite there yet from a business perspective. We will continue to look at the market trends and if there is the right opportunity at the right moment, that’s when we will revisit this topic.</p>



<p><strong>Are there any plans for a DLC to bridge the gap between Final Fantasy VII Rebirth and the third title in the Remake project, similar to Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade?</strong></p>



<p>There were definitely some ideas to create a Rebirth DLC and that was the plan at a certain point in time, but when we revisited this topic and we thought about what our priorities should be and what the fans are looking forward to the most. We figured that what fans want the most is to bring the third installment as soon as possible. That would take priority over the Rebirth DLC, so we decided to take that approach.</p>



<p>With that being said, once we release the third installment, there is the possibility of having a DLC for that third installment. With the conclusion of the Final Fantasy VII Remake trilogy, there’s probably going to be a much wider audience for Final Fantasy as a whole.&nbsp;Whether we bring another new DLC or a full title, that’s something we are actively considering.</p>



<p><strong>If enough fans ask for it, would you consider a standalone Queen’s Blood game to be a priority?</strong></p>



<p>As I mentioned in my previous response, the utmost importance right now is to work hard towards that third installment and make sure it gets released as soon as possible with the highest quality achievable.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Right now, the solo Queen’s Blood title is probably not in the list of our priorities. We actually haven’t determined any priorities after the release of the third installment, so things are really up in the air right now. If there is enough demand, a solo Queen’s Blood title is definitely something we can consider.</p>



<p><strong>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth has a massive soundtrack. My last question to you: is there one specific song that you’ve had on repeat or listened to the most out of the whole soundtrack?</strong></p>



<p>Obviously, there’s the staples like the Final Fantasy main theme that we’ve heard over and over, but for me personally, I do like the Stamp song Bow Wow Wow (Chuken Stamp).</p>



<p><strong>It’s very catchy.</strong></p>



<p>I hope a lot of people like that track too.</p>



<p><strong>Thank you so much for your time.</strong></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>There are plenty of Pokémon to encounter in Pokémon Legends: Z-A across Lumiose City, with Wild Zones having different spawns for Pokémon. For all the details on Wild Zone 2, we’ve got you covered.</p>



<p>Wild Zone 2 may be accessible very early in the story, but it’s well worth hunting for new additions to your party here as there are three Pokémon that can be evolved to unlock Mega Evolutions later on, so adding them to your ranks early on is advised to increase their levels in anticipation for battles.</p>



<p>If you’re on the hunt for a specific Pokémon, here are the details on everything you can find in Wild Zone 2 in Pokémon Legends: Z-A.</p>







<figure><figcaption>Fishing time. Screenshot by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Wild Zone 2 in Pokémon Legends: Z-A is available to explore after you complete Main Mission 5, and is one of the earliest areas you will be able to explore.</strong></p>



<p>There are six Pokémon species in total to find and catch to earn the golden crown for fully discovering the Pokémon in Wild Zone 2, earning a chunk of points towards Mable’s Research rewards.</p>



<p>The table below shows all Pokémon that spawn in Wild Zone 2, the time of day required, and notes on the specific location where they can be found.</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th data-align="center">Pokémon </th><th data-align="center">Time of Day</th><th data-align="center">Location</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-align="center">Binacle</td><td data-align="center">Day/Night</td><td data-align="center">Central island &amp; left side</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Budew</td><td data-align="center">Day/Night</td><td data-align="center">Left side</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Kakuna</td><td data-align="center">Day/Night</td><td data-align="center">On trees</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Magikarp</td><td data-align="center">Day/Night</td><td data-align="center">Water</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Patrat</td><td data-align="center">Day/Night</td><td data-align="center">Central island &amp; left side</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Staryu</td><td data-align="center">Night</td><td data-align="center">Water</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>







<p><strong>There is one spawn point for Alpha Pokémon in Wild Zone 2, with the Pokémon that appears depending on the time of day.</strong></p>



<p>The locked spawn point for the Alpha Pokémon is located on the right-hand side of the zone from the fast-travel point, accessible via stepping stones from the top-right of the zone.</p>



<p>Other Pokémon in Wild Zone 2 can spawn as Alpha Pokémon, however, as every spawn has a chance of appearing as an Alpha. However, there are guaranteed spawns that can be farmed for valuable resources like EXP Candies.</p>



<p>All the details you need on alpha Pokémon in Wild Zone 2 are below.</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th data-align="center">Pokémon </th><th data-align="center">Time of Day</th><th data-align="center">Location</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-align="center">Alpha Magikarp</td><td data-align="center">Day</td><td data-align="center">Far-right from fast travel point</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Alpha Staryu</td><td data-align="center">Night</td><td data-align="center">Far-right from the fast travel point</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/skyblivion">Skyblivion</a> might have bagged more headlines, but it's far from the only ambitious modding project being worked on for a Bethesda game with the goal of putting a fresh spin on a classic. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fallout-4">Fallout 4</a>: Project Arroyo arguably has an even tougher task, with its team aiming to reimagine the turn-based and isometric <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fallout-2">Fallout 2</a> through Fallout 4's 3D action lens.</p>
<p>In a fresh interview with YouTuber <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kDvULKQCbmQ">AVV Gaming</a> that also sheds light on how the team are hoping to incorporate aspects of an original Fallout remake mod that was mothballed last year, Project Arroyo lead Damion Daponte has discussed how they've approached the difficult task of deciding how much to tweak as they reinterpret the 90s RPG.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"I would say the hardest part is walking the thin line of not making a completely different game than Fallout 2, but also not keeping it exactly [how it is]," Daponte said in response to being asked about the project's biggest challenges. "Because we could easily just keep it exactly the same, but I will say, especially in this engine, it will be a worse game if we do keep it exactly the same. Even if people don't realise that. I'm sure some people will get angry that we've changed anything. There's really no winning when it comes out. I think most of the changes will be for the better."</p>
<p>As you might expect given the nature of the two games, Daponte outlined that most of the changes the Project Arroyo team are making are related to how Fallout 2's tales and locations are best packaged in a Fallout 4-style game. For example, rather than putting together one big open world space to house everything, as was originally the plan, the modders have opted to break things up into hub worlds that are better at translating Fallout 2's broader geography. So, you won't be able to see San Francisco's Golden Gate bridge from everywhere, but the aim's to have enough custom locations and encounters in and around each hub to give folks their exploration fix.</p>

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AwJlcesILvY" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figure>


<p>As for adapting individual missions or levels, Daponte outlined the process as follows:</p>
<blockquote>We will block out the area very similarly to how Fallout 2 blocked out the level. However, there will be some minor changes [that] I'll know immediately [to make] with certain areas. For example, the church at the den area in Fallout 2. I wanted more options to enter. If you have a stealth build, I wanted the player to be able to lockpick the door in the back and come in through the back. And then on the inside there's crates and stuff. So, we laid out the crates in a way that the player could sneak in and hide behind the crates and loot them while there's people inside.</blockquote>
<p>In line with that, a lot of the changes stem from accounting for how the player's movement differs, and also elements like adding verticality to Fallout 2's fairly flat isometric sprawls. Presumably, they'll be taking a few cues from how Bethesda themselves reinvented Fallout as a 3D first-person action-RPG with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fallout-3">Fallout 3</a>.</p><p>It's a challenge that another Fallout 4 modding project, original Fallout remake project Fallout: Vault 13, also faced prior to <a href="https://www.vg247.com/fallout-4-fallout-1-remake-mod-fallout-vault-13-development-suspended">its development being suspended after releasing a demo</a> last year. Those modders were working closely with Project Arroyo's devs, and as such, the latter's team are hoping to incorporate an updated version of the NCR-heavy region around Shady Sands designed for Vault 13 into their creation. Daponte said its inclusion is contingent on how it affects performance, but if it's doable, it'll help speed up work towards an eventual release.</p>
<p>All in all, I'm keen to see what Daponte and co's project looks like whenever it comes out. As the modder acknowledged in this chat, there are plenty of folks who're aware of Fallout 2's contributions to the series' worldbuilding, but that don't get on well with how it plays mechanically. Even for those who do, it'd be another excuse to delve back in and see how Frank Horrigan's doing.</p>

            <p>James Bond and Lana Del Rey fans have joined forces in speculation over whether the singer has provided a song for the forthcoming game 007 First Light.</p>
<p>Del Rey has registered a new song with the American Society of Composers, Authors, and publishers (ASCAP), as shared on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/lanadelrey/comments/1oaryb3/lana_del_rey_has_registered_a_new_song_titled/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">reddit</a>. Its title? First Light.</p>
<p>Of course, this could just be a new song unrelated to the game. But as Bond fans spotted the news, speculation of the song's purpose for the game has grown. After all, the singer has long been discussed as a suitable Bond theme candidate.</p>

<p>Back in 2024, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/lwMKyjtuVM8">Del Rey told the BBC</a> she wrote a theme song for the Sam Mendes-directed Spectre (2015), but it was turned down.</p>
<p>"How has that not happened yet?" she said, when asked on the possibility of singing a Bond theme. "One day maybe, probably not. But I'm going to continue to do my little Nancy Sinatra thing every now and then and just pretend that it's the title track."</p>
<p>Perhaps now she's finally got her wish.</p>
<p>If so, it would also hint at the authenticity and production value of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/io-interactive">IO Interactive</a>'s forthcoming game, alongside its star-studded cast that includes <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/patrick-gibson-next-james-bond-007-first-light-io-interactive-interview">Patrick Gibson as Bond</a>, and Gemma Chan as new character Dr. Selina Tan.</p>
<p>It won't be the first Bond game to receive its own theme, though. Among others, Joss Stone sang the theme song for 007 Blood Stone, while Mya sang Everything or Nothing from the game of the same name, and Nicole Scherzinger recorded Tina Turner's GoldenEye for its Wii remake.</p>
<p>Still, considering her longtime association with potentially singing a Bond theme, Del Rey would be a huge win for the game.</p>
<p>An initial trailer for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/in-one-trailer-io-interactive-has-totally-proven-it-gets-bond-and-its-all-about-the-salivating-consumerism">007 First Light proved that IO Interactive 'gets' Bond</a>, full as it was with consumerism.</p>
<p>Then, 007 First Light was fully unveiled at the PlayStation State of Play in September, with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/007-first-light-james-bond-preview-hitman-uncharted-comparisons">Eurogamer taking a detailed look at the game</a>. And there are <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/007-first-light-may-be-an-original-story-but-you-might-have-missed-plenty-of-homages-to-the-bonds-that-came-before">plenty of nods to past Bond films</a>, too.</p>
<p>Moreover, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/developer-io-interactive-on-why-bond-needs-to-earn-hiss-iconic-theme-music-in-007-first-light">IO Interactive stated Bond has to "earn his themes"</a>, discussing the game's score developing as Bond grows into the character we know and love. But will that include a Lana Del Rey theme song?</p>

			<p>With its deep Job System, Final Fantasy Tactics - The Ivalice Chronicles allows a wide variety of builds that can deal a lot of damage quickly. While many players focus on creating the perfect Physical damage build to <a href="https://wccftech.com/how-to/final-fantasy-tactics-the-ivalice-chronicles-the-best-support-abilities-for-max-physical-damage/">break the damage cap</a>, there's a fun Magic build that can easily clear maps solo, and provide solid damage and support at no MP cost against bosses.</p>



<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>NOTE: Build refined and thoroughly tested by the author, who completed <em>Final Fantasy Tactics: The Ivalice Chronicles</em> twice in Enhanced Mode’s Tactician difficulty using different builds and party setups, on the up-to-date Steam release as of October 20, 2025. The build is also highly effective in Knight and Squire difficulties and in Classic Mode. Screenshots captured from the same version</strong></em></p>

<p>Although high-level Black Magick spells like the -aja spells and Flare deal more damage, using the Iaido abilities, which scale with Magick Attack and ignore Faith, is the better choice. Not only Murasame can outdamage the -aja spells under certain conditions, every other Iaido ability except for Ashura can outdamage the -aga spells when an enemy is not weak against a specific element, with no casting time, no MP cost, no risk of friendly fire and better area of effect. The risk of getting into the enemies' face is offset by the Auto-Potion reaction ability.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><em><strong>NOTE: After concluding the test against the Minotaur enemy, each ability was also tested against human enemies and monsters with no elemental weaknesses to ensure general consistency. Depending on the user and the target's Faith values, -aga and -aja spells can deal the same damage as Koutetsu's and Muramasa's Iaido abilities or more, but with no MP cost, no cast time, no Faith scaling and larger area of effect, their reliability still stands.</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>



<h3 id="h-high-movement">High Movement</h3>



<figure><figcaption><em>Movement +2 is the most reliable Movement Ability available to female units in Final Fantasy Tactics - The Ivalice Chronicles</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>The recommended Movement +2 ability is crucial for the build, providing the needed reliable movement to use Iaido appropriately.</p>



<blockquote>
<p><strong><em>NOTE: Some players may prefer Teleport (Time Mage - 3000 JP) for its superior range and ability to bypass terrain and unit elevation. However, Teleport not only requires a lot of JP grinding to learn, but is also highly unreliable, its success rate dropping significantly for every tile you attempt to move past the unit's base Movemenet stat, which is only 3 for the Black Mage. This makes long-distance teleports very risky, often resulting in failed movement and higher risk of receiving high damage, which should be avoided for a low-HP Job like the Black Mage</em>, <em>regardless of the protection granted by Auto-Potion</em>.</strong></p>
</blockquote>



<p>Since the best Iaido abilities (<strong>Muramasa</strong>, <strong>Ame-no-Murakumo</strong>) and the supportive ones are centered on the user, movement and positioning are critical for both damage and party utility.</p>



<p>This movement flexibility allows the unit to reliably position itself to:</p>



<ul>
<li>Hit a large group of enemies with any damaging ability or target multiple allies with Murasame (healing).</li>



<li>Apply zero-cost party buffs with Kiyomori (instant Protect and Shell) or Masamune (instant Regen and Haste)</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-early-and-late-game-viability">Early and Late Game Viability</h3>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Final-Fantasy-Tactics-The-Ivalice-Chronicles-Black-Mage-Samurai-Master-Late-Game-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>The Black Mage Samurai build has no trouble clearing maps solo with the most powerful Katanas like the Kiku-ichimonji</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>While this powerful build reaches its maximum potential in the late game - when the most powerful katanas can be purchased or <a href="https://wccftech.com/how-to/how-to-get-the-genji-gear-set-in-final-fantasy-tactics-the-ivalice-chronicles/">stolen from certain enemies</a> - its viability is strong even during the mid game. The Black Mage Samurai Master can easily become an early asset to your party thanks to Kotetsu, the second purchasable katana, which already outdamages the -aga spells with no MP cost and zero cast time under the right conditions.</p>



<p>This build also allows you to bypass relying on the Arithmetician's Arithmeticks for high magic damage. While Arithmeticks offers superior tactical safety by allowing you to target units regardless of range, it always carries the risk of accidentally buffing or healing your enemies.</p>



<p>Armed with this build, you can easily take on the many challenges the game offers.

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/roblox">Roblox</a>, Clash Royale and various other games and gaming services have been struck down by an "operational issue" with Amazon's web services today, though Amazon themselves promise that they're already seeing "significant signs of recovery". </p>
<!--more-->
<p>According to the provider's <a href="https://health.aws.amazon.com/health/status">bug report dashboard</a>, 62 Amazon services have been "impacted", with some experiencing "increased error rates and latencies". Amazon's down detector says they first started noticing issues in "the US-EAST-1 Region", earlier this morning UK time, but the problem has spread - Amazon provide cloud computing support to a vast number of clients worldwide.</p>
<p>Fortnite players report that they're unable to sign in, with the Epic Games Store refusing to load. Our guides writer Callum has been having trouble getting Roblox to run. The busted cloud functionality has even <a href="https://x.com/PlayRematch/status/1980194271082000862">taken out the legs</a> from under <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/rematch">Rematch</a>, forcing players to go out and play football using actual feet atrophied by years of computer thralldom.</p>
<p>Amazon's outage has trashed a wider range of non-gaming thingywatsits, including AI tool Perplexity, Snapchat, Airtable, Canva, and even various mechanisms for the ordering of unhealthy takeaway food. *Extremely Emperor Palpatine voice* I'm afraid the McDonalds app will be quite non-operational when your friends arrive. I've also noticed that Slack is running rather stiffly this morning. More's the pity, I will be unable to burden other RPS writers with my requests for edits.</p>
<p>On Reddit, people are <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/alexa/comments/1obdalz/anybody_else_having_their_alexa_say_sorry_the/">reporting difficulties with the company's Alexa chatbot</a>. Apparently, Amazon-powered doorbells have stopped working in some places. Somebody go rewatch Terminator and remind me whether this is how Skynet got started.</p>
<p>I'll update you as and when the mists clear. In the meantime, maybe stick to playing games offline.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Pokémon Legends: Z-A takes place entirely in Lumiose City, but that doesn’t mean there isn’t a ton to explore. Pokémon spawns are scattered in various Wild Zones, and we’ve got all the spawns and Alpha Pokémon in Wild Zone 1.</p>



<p>In total, Pokémon Legends: Z-A has 20 Wild Zones to explore, which unlock periodically at various points in the story, with Wild Zone 1 being just the tip of the iceberg. However, there are some handy Pokémon available in this spot that can be long-term inclusions in your party.</p>



<p>For all the full Pokémon spawns in Wild Zone 1, including the Alpha Pokémon available, look no further than this guide.</p>







<figure><figcaption>Hunt them down. Screenshot by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Wild Zone 1 is immediately available to access in Pokémon</strong> <strong>Legends: Z-A, serving as part of the introduction locations, and features several Pokémon</strong>.</p>



<p>In total, there are seven species of Pokémon to find and catch to complete Mable’s Research Task for Wild Zone 1, though not all of them will be available to encounter immediately as some story progression is required before you can fully explore the area.</p>



<p>The table below shows all Pokémon that spawn in Wild Zone 1, the time of day required, and notes on the specific location they can be found.</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th data-align="center">Pokémon</th><th data-align="center">Time of Day</th><th data-align="center">Location</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-align="center">Bunnelby</td><td data-align="center">Day/Night</td><td data-align="center">Ground Level</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Fletchling</td><td data-align="center">Day/Night</td><td data-align="center">Ground level</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Mareep</td><td data-align="center">Day/Night</td><td data-align="center">Two spawns directly opposite fast-travel point</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Pichu</td><td data-align="center">Day/Night</td><td data-align="center">Top-right opposite fast-travel point, requires Rock Smash</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Pidgey</td><td data-align="center">Day/Night</td><td data-align="center">Rooftops</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Weedle</td><td data-align="center">Day/Night</td><td data-align="center">Ground Level &amp; Rooftops</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>







<p><strong>There is one locked Alpha Pokémon</strong> <strong>spawn in Wild Zone 1, which is fixed to always be present in the game. However, it won’t be the only Alpha you can encounter in this area.</strong></p>



<p>Every Pokémon in Legends: Z-A has a chance of spawning as an Alpha, with only some having fixed and guaranteed spawns. Many of those rotate with several potential Pokémon, but this isn’t the case in Wild Zone 1.</p>



<p>All the details you need on Alpha Pokémon in Wild Zone 1 are below.</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th data-align="center">Pokémon</th><th data-align="center">Time of Day</th><th data-align="center">Location</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-align="center">Alpha Pidgey</td><td data-align="center">Day/Night</td><td data-align="center">Rooftops</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>

            <p>Final Fantasy composer Nobuo Uematsu has taken a stance against the use of generative AI for music, stating he hasn't used it "and probably never will".</p>
<p>The technology has been increasingly used in game development - even by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a> itself - but has received plenty of criticism.</p>
<p>Now, in an interview with <a href="https://www.jasrac.or.jp/magazine/interview/25/251010.html">JASRAC Magazine</a> about his career (thanks <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/final-fantasy-composer-nobuo-uematsu-says-hes-never-used-generative-ai-and-never-will-hardship-is-what-makes-the-creative-process-rewarding/">Automaton</a>), Uematsu has discussed his thoughts on AI, stating it "feels more rewarding to go through the hardships of creating something myself".</p>

<p>When asked about advancements in game music, Uematsu suggested composers could work on smoothly transitioning between different pieces. "Perhaps AI will be able to handle something like that well in the future," he said.</p>
<p>He was then asked further about his thoughts on AI.</p>
<p>"I've never used AI and probably never will," said Uematsu.</p>
<p>"I think it still feels more rewarding to go through the hardships of creating something myself. When you listen to music, the fun is also in discovering the background of the person who created it, right? AI does not have that kind of background though.</p>
<p>"Even when it comes to live performances, music produced by people is unstable, and everyone does it in their own unique way. And what makes it sound so satisfying are precisely those fluctuations and imperfections."</p>
<p>Last year, Square Enix CEO Takashi Kiryu stated the company will be <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/square-enix-intends-to-be-aggressive-in-applying-ai-says-ceo">"aggressive in applying AI"</a> and other "cutting-edge technologies", with Foamstars producer Kosuke Okatani admitting the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/square-enix-dabbled-with-ai-technology-for-foamstars">development team "dabbled" with using AI</a>.</p>
<p>Indeed, according to a report from Japan's Computer Entertainment Supplier's Association (CESA), which organises the Tokyo Games Show, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/over-half-of-japanese-game-companies-are-using-ai-in-development-states-report-from-tokyo-games-show-organiser">over half of Japanese game companies are using AI in development</a>.</p>
<p>Uematsu has certainly become more vocal in recent years during interviews, stating in a 2024 interview that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-composer-uematsu-says-game-music-cannot-develop-further-by-copying-films">game music has become too similar to film</a> and "cannot develop further" if continuing in this direction.</p>
<p>And despite rumours last year, he <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/no-final-fantasy-composer-nobuo-uematsu-isnt-retiring-from-video-game-music">won't be retiring from video game music work</a>. He's already confirmed he'll be <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-composer-uematsu-returning-for-remake-trilogy-finale">returning to the Final Fantasy 7 Remake series</a> for a new theme song for the final part of the trilogy.</p>

<p>The 'Chip Fever' event (as translated from <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/jp/topics/article/962612c2-10de-40b0-9afc-4c019ce62d62">Nintendo's Japanese website</a> via Google, so the name may be different in the West) will get underway on <strong>Tuesday 28th October</strong>, and will be sticking around until <strong>4th November</strong>.</p>
<p>You can find the precise times that the event will begin in your region below:</p>
<ul><li><strong>North America:</strong> 1am PDT / 2am MDT / 3am CDT / 4am EDT</li><li><strong>UK/Ire:</strong> 8am GMT</li><li><strong>Europe:</strong> 9am CET / 10am EET</li><li><strong>Asia/Oceania:</strong> 5pm JST / 4pm AWST / 7pm AEDT</li></ul><div><figure data-videoid="fMx2XNyAq4E" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fMx2XNyAq4E?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/fMx2XNyAq4E?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fMx2XNyAq4E?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed5d98e4yjqwnm&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>837k</span></a></p>

<p>As the name suggests, 'Chip Fever' will provide a Chip-focused twist on the usual Emerald Rush format. Those taking part in this event will have to collect as much Ore as possible using only Chip-based Perks — ones like Chip Hoarder, or Chip Negotiator.</p>
<p>If you hit a high score in this event, you'll be able to nab two new figures for DK Island: Kong Bananza and Enguard. These figures aren't the most useful additions themselves, but at least they'll look good in a full collection.</p>

<p>We had a perfectly good time with the Donkey Kong Bananza DLC when it arrived on Switch 2 last month. The Emerald Rush roguelike mode in a lot of fun and seeing DK Island again brought plenty of smiles, but the whole package felt a little bit empty otherwise. Let's hope that these in-game events help to beef things out a bit, eh?</p>
