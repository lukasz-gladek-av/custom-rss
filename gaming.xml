<p>While there have been <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/01/rumour-insider-claims-that-halo-master-chief-collection-will-come-to-switch-2">rumours for some time now</a> about this iconic series being brought across to other console platforms, it's now official.

<p>While there's no word from Xbox about this, Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer has issued a reminder about how Xbox is very much open to supporting the Switch 2 going forward, and how Microsoft's gaming division has already received "excellent support" from Nintendo.</p>
<p>Here's what he had to say about this during a <a href="https://www.famitsu.com/article/202510/55776">recent chat with Famitsu</a>, according to a rough translation:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"We are making efforts to lower the barrier to entry for people to play our games through services like Xbox Play Anywhere and Xbox Game Pass. However, if there are people who want to play our games on the PlayStation 5 or the Nintendo Switch 2, we would love for them to play our games on those platforms. In that regard, we have received excellent support from both Sony Interactive Entertainment and Nintendo."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Spencer has <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/01/xbox-is-really-looking-forward-to-supporting-switch-2">previously mentioned this year</a> how the Xbox team is "really looking forward" to supporting the Switch 2, so now that Nintendo's new hybrid system has been released (and more developers are finally getting their hands on dev kits), maybe there will be more announcements going forward.</p>
<p>Xbox has also stated over the past year how it wants to bring more games to "more platforms", and even did a deal in 2023 to revive the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wiiu/call_of_duty_ghosts">Call of Duty</a> series on Nintendo devices. Last year, it also released titles such as <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/grounded">Grounded</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/pentiment">Pentiment</a> on the Switch.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/dying-light-the-beast-nightmare-inspirations/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dying-light-the-beast%E2%80%99s-nightmare-difficulty-is-inspired-by-alien-isolation-and-resident-evil-3.1334752/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>In a blog post on Dying Light’s Pilgrim Outpost, Tymon Smektala, the franchise director at Techland, has expanded on everything coming to Dying Light: The Beast. The Techland veteran explained about the Call of the Beast challenge path, the New Game+ mechanics coming soon, and the new ‘Nightmare Mode’ that’s being added in the future.</p>



<p>In Tymon’s words, some elements of Nightmare Difficulty have been inspired by other games, namely Alien: Isolation and Resident Evil 3: Nemesis.</p>



<h2 id="h-dying-light-the-beast-is-the-gift-that-keeps-on-giving">Dying Light: The Beast is the Gift That Keeps on Giving</h2>



<p>Dying Light: The Beast is a phenomenal open-world zombie game with plenty of meat on the bones, despite being born as a DLC for Dying Light 2: Stay Human. In a post on the Pilgrim Outpost, Tymon Smektala explained about everything else that’s in store for The Beast.</p>



<p>While <a href="https://pilgrimoutpost.techlandgg.com/news/dev-blog-11-week-roadmap" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the post</a> references Legend Levels, the Ray Tracing update for PC, and the collaboration with PUBG Mobile, one of the juiciest tidbits came from the discussion about Nightmare Mode.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We’re currently looking into each of our bosses to see how we can adjust their behaviors to make them more unpredictable. On top of that we’re also considering some neat tweaks to our Volatile enemies – these are just intentions, so I don’t want to promise too much, but we’re looking at games like Alien: Isolation or Resident Evil 3: Nemesis for inspiration.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The Nightmare Mode loop will be introduced <strong>after </strong>New Game+ and the Legend Levels update, and it’ll be more of an intelligent update than just making enemies stronger. That’s what Tymon has promised, anyway.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Yes, enemies will do more damage and the game more demanding, but that isn’t the point on its own. We’d like to try a more realistic survival loop – so expect some new mechanics in that regard.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Dying Light: The Beast players can participate in an ongoing challenge path that will run into 2026. Through this, users can unlock exclusive rewards for taking part in community challenges, the first of which required the player base to rack up 60 million sliced off limbs.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Twitch CEO Dan Clancy Responds to Emiru Assault: ‘We Failed’]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/twitch-ceo-dan-clancy-responds-emiru/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/twitch-ceo-dan-clancy-responds-to-emiru-assault-%E2%80%98we-failed%E2%80%99.1334749/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Recently, clips surfaced on social media showing Emiru, a popular streamer and cosplayer, being forcefully assaulted by a man at TwitchCon in San Diego. The content creator was approached by a man who grabbed her in an embrace and seemed to try to kiss her. In the clips that emerged, we saw a woeful response from event security, and in the days that followed, Twitch failed to address the incident.</p>



<p>Now, in a lengthy post, Twitch CEO Dan Clancy has written about the incident involving Emiru and has stressed what is being done to improve things moving forward.</p>



<h2 id="h-it-means-a-lot-to-us">‘It Means a Lot to Us’</h2>



<p>Dan Clancy’s <a href="https://x.com/Twitch/status/1981825064904667169" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">response</a> to the Emiru assault situation was lengthy, but fans and other creators have already batted the statement down and attempted to kick back the ‘apology’:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>First, I want to be upfront and take accountability for the security incident that occurred during Emiru’s Meet and Greet. It shouldn’t have happened and we take that very seriously. We failed, both in allowing it to occur, and in our response following. We mismanaged our communications about the incident, and that includes the comments I made. I apologize to Emiru for all that took place. </p>



<p>What are we doing moving forward? For Meet and Greets, we’ve begun a complete analysis of the incident that took place, as well as other issues that came to our attention after TwitchCon concluded. We’re examining everything, from how we do sign ups, to the layout, to increased security controls. </p>



<p>We’re also doing a comprehensive review of overall event safety and security, and will be making updates for future TwitchCons. While we won’t be sharing all security updates for privacy and safety reasons, we will keep our community informed about changes that directly impact attendees. </p>



<p>We have heard concerns about IRL streaming at TwitchCon. Twitch has evolved over the years, and IRL streaming is a part of Twitch. But, we need to ensure that TwitchCon meets the needs of a variety of participants. We will be reviewing how we handle IRL streaming at TwitchCon, and will have more to share soon. </p>



<p>Finally, we got clear feedback on accessibility across the event. We’re reviewing with our teams, including our production and venue staff, so that we’re better equipped for future events. </p>



<p>You put a lot of trust in us by attending TwitchCon, and we take our responsibility to keep you safe seriously. We know that TwitchCon means a lot to a lot of people, and it means a lot to us. Be on the lookout for more updates, and thanks for being a part of Twitch. </p>



<p>– Dan Clancy</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Users were quick to jump on Dan Clancy’s comments under the post on X (formerly Twitter), with some pointing out how much of a holistic failure TwitchCon was (and will likely continue to be).</p>



<p>One streamer wrote, ‘I must pathetically claim that I am EMBARRASSED to be a Twitch streamer.’ Another was quick to point out similar failings from Twitch: ‘And you’re only saying this because Emi’s a big streamer and there are a lot of eyes on this. How many smaller streamers have dealt with similar or worse but have had their complaints swept under the rug?’</p>



<p>Do you think Twitch needs to do better, or is this par for the course for the platform? Let me know what you’re thinking on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/Bhv3AMa5a9">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>In the run-up to the release of Black Ops 7, a point of contention for the community is around the innovation (or lack of) tied to Call of Duty: Warzone. The battle royale platform that was released in March 2020 has started to stagnate yet again, and fans are dropping off for alternate experiences, such as the upcoming Battlefield 6 ‘RedSec’ battle royale release.</p>



<p>In a recent blog and <a href="https://x.com/RavenSoftware/status/1981852213581381882" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">social media post</a>, Raven Software acknowledged that Warzone’s Resurgence experience is becoming stale and recognized that the Rebirth Island map is in dire need of a revitalization.</p>



<h2 id="h-too-little-too-late">Too Little, Too Late</h2>



<p>Many Warzone creators and diehard fans have stressed that Raven Software is making changes far too late, especially as the first season of Black Ops 7 will bring a new small-form Warzone map – <strong>Haven’s Hollow</strong>.</p>



<p>In any case, the team at Raven is desperate to refresh the Rebirth experience by tidying up the map:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We’ve heard you loud and clear – Rebirth Island and the broader Resurgence experience have started to feel a bit stale.</p>



<p>So, to start, we’re delivering a full refresh to Rebirth Island in Season 02, which includes new POI updates, a cosmetic pass, and several other upgrades that improve flow.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Following the launch of Haven’s Hollow, Raven Software will reintroduce a map rotation system, switching between Haven’s Hollow and Rebirth Island to keep things ‘fresh’.</p>



<p>It was promised that, in the coming weeks, a ‘deep dive on how (they) intend to deliver a higher frequency of updates’ will take place. It was confirmed that Warzone will receive balancing changes to alter the meta <strong>twice per season</strong>, and that from season two onwards, the competitive community will receive updated Ranked and Private Match mechanics.</p>



<p>All this will come before or during the launch of Avalon, the new Blackout-themed Warzone map landing during season two, several weeks after the launch of Black Ops 7 on November 14.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/former-playstation-exec-slams-live-service-games-repetitive/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/former-playstation-exec-slams-live-service-games-%E2%80%98it%E2%80%99s-a-repetitive-action-engagement-device%E2%80%99.1334740/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>In a recent interview, former PlayStation executive Shawn Layden went in against the company’s pivot to focusing on live-service games, which has yet to pay off. For several years, PlayStation’s studios have tried to produce a solid live-service game, but have mostly failed in their quest to do so.</p>



<p>Layden, who departed PlayStation in 2019 due to the creative direction the company was taking, recently criticized the live-service market, explaining how, in his eyes, live-service titles <strong>aren’t real games</strong>.</p>



<h2 id="h-again-and-again-and-again">Again and Again and Again</h2>



<p>In an interview with <a href="https://www.theringer.com/2025/10/24/video-games/sony-playstation-online-multiplayer-live-service-struggles-concord-marathon" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The Ringer</a>, a variety of indutstry names gave their two cents to answer the question, ‘Why can’t Sony make more multiplayer hits?’</p>



<p>One such name was Shawn Layden, a former PlayStation executive who was at the company for just short of a decade, who has fired shots at the live-service mission on PlayStation’s slate.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>A live-service game to me isn’t really a game. It’s a repetitive action engagement device.</p>



<p>For me, a game—because of where I come from—means I need three things. I need a story, I need a character, and I need a world. And&nbsp;<em>Horizon</em>,&nbsp;<em>God of War</em>, and&nbsp;<em>Uncharted</em>&nbsp;have all three of those things. </p>



<p>If you’re doing a live-service game, you just need a repetitive action that most people can get their head around, an ability to communicate in that world with other like-minded people, and the player’s desire to do it again and again and again.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Layden went on to stress that every developer successful in the live-service space found the winning formula ‘five, six years ago’. There was a boom of sorts that saw games like Fortnite skyrocket in popularity, and since then, everyone with a multiplayer offering seems to have jumped on the seasonal operating model.</p>



<p>These days, it’s very rare to succeed with a new live-service game, Layden insists:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>It’s like a mirage on the top of a sand dune. You pursue it. You can’t quite get there. Or if you do get there, what you brought to the party no one wants to play anyway.</p>
</blockquote>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>During the Halo World Championship event, the future of the Halo series was uncovered, including the imminent arrival of Halo: Campaign Evolved on PS5. This marks a milestone moment, as it’s the first time in history that a Halo title has wound up on a PlayStation platform.</p>



<p>Those who have potentially never played a Halo game because of their platform of choice are now preparing to dive into the sci-fi shooter series. That’s all well and good, but when is Halo: Campaign Evolved coming to PS5?</p>



<p>Let’s find out about the release window.</p>



<h2 id="h-when-is-halo-campaign-evolved-coming-out">When is Halo: Campaign Evolved Coming Out?</h2>



<p>Halo is a legendary series that has been the face of Xbox for more than two decades. The franchise has been expanded over the years with a live-action television series, books, animated projects, and, of course, a hulking stack of major and minor games.</p>



<p>Next year, Halo will come to PlayStation for the first time. This was addressed by the PS team in a <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/10/24/halo-campaign-evolved-launches-on-ps5-in-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recent blog post</a>:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>For nearly 25 years, Halo has offered players an epic sci-fi universe to explore, unforgettable characters to meet, and exhilarating gameplay to experience together. From large-scale battles to friendships formed over late-night co-op sessions, Halo has always been more than just a game – it’s about the players who’ve made it part of their lives.&nbsp;</p>



<p>From the beginning, we wanted to build a world with stories and experiences that bring people together. And now, for the first time, PS5 players will get to be part of that journey too.</p>
</blockquote>



<p><strong>Unfortunately, there isn’t a release date for Halo: Campaign Evolved on PS5, Xbox, or PC</strong>. It can be wishlisted on all these platforms, but aside from a window of ‘2026’, there are no further indications as to when Halo: Campaign Evolved will be released.</p>

                <p>Retro Games Limited just launched a new version of its miniature Commodore 64 home computer. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/THEC64-Mini-Black-Not-Machine-Specific/dp/B0FKJCL1ZF?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The C64 Mini - Black Edition</a> is a limited release that celebrates the talented developers who create modern Commodore games. The Black Edition comes preloaded with The C64 Mini's original 64-game lineup <em>and </em>25 modern titles, including all-time C64 greats like Sam's Journey and A Pig Quest.</p><p>The C64 Mini - Black Edition retails for $120 and is exclusive to Amazon in the United States. Amazon is "temporarily out of stock" on launch day (October 24), but you can still place an order. The original C64 Mini launched in 2018 with a $70 MSRP--you can <a href="https://www.amazon.com/C64-Mini-not-machine-specific/dp/B07GMV1X1K?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">grab one today from Amazon for only $51</a>. The substantial price hike is probably partially tied to economic changes and tariffs, but the inclusion of the modern games likely played a much larger role.</p><p>The vast majority of the new games--19 to be exact--are sold on itch.io by big Commodore 64 publishers, including <a href="https://psytronik.itch.io/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Psytronik</a> and <a href="https://www.protovision.games/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Protovision</a>. Psytronik's games are usually five bucks or less, but titles published by Protovision tend to carry higher price tags. There are four preloaded Protovision games that would normally cost around $55 combined: <a href="https://protovision.itch.io/sams-journey" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Sam's Journey</a> ($24), <a href="https://piggy18.itch.io/a-pig-quest" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">A Pig Quest</a> ($11.61), <a href="https://protovision.itch.io/mw-ultra" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">MW Ultra</a> ($11), and <a href="https://protovision.itch.io/yeti-mountain" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Yeti Mountain</a> ($9). These are among the most ambitious C64 games around. For instance, developer Knights of Bytes created over 2,000 screens for Sam's Journey's 30 extremely long levels. It's one of the best retro platformers I've ever played (it's also <a href="https://knightsofbytes.itch.io/samsjourney-nes" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">available on NES</a>). In short: The $50 price increase seems more than reasonable.</p><div data-embed-type="buylink" data-ref-id="4799" data-template="4" data-size="buylink__listicle" data-title="Commodore 64 Mini (C64 Black Edition)" data-collection="" title="Commodore 64 Mini (C64 Black Edition)">             <h2>                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/THEC64-Mini-Black-Not-Machine-Specific/dp/B0FKJCL1ZF?tag=gamespot-promos-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/THEC64-Mini-Black-Not-Machine-Specific\/dp\/B0FKJCL1ZF?tag=gamespot-promos-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/THEC64-Mini-Black-Not-Machine-Specific/dp/B0FKJCL1ZF?tag=gamespot-promos-20">The C64 Mini - Black Edition (89 Games)</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/THEC64-Mini-Black-Not-Machine-Specific/dp/B0FKJCL1ZF?tag=gamespot-promos-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/THEC64-Mini-Black-Not-Machine-Specific\/dp\/B0FKJCL1ZF?tag=gamespot-promos-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/THEC64-Mini-Black-Not-Machine-Specific/dp/B0FKJCL1ZF?tag=gamespot-promos-20">$120 | Available Now</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <div><p>The Black Edition comes with the same items as the original: The C64 Mini computer, a classic USB joystick, USB power cable, HDMI cable, and instruction manual. Like numerous other mini consoles, it doesn't come with an AC adapter, but basically any USB brick will work. Or you can just power it through one of the USB ports on your TV.</p><p>The C64 Mini is approximately half the size of the original Commodore 64 computer. The "keyboard" is decorative--none of the mini home computers have functioning keyboards. But if you want to use the BASIC interpreter to write your own programs and/or boot games you add to The C64 Mini via USB stick, you can plug just about any keyboard into the second USB port. You can also connect a second joystick for multiplayer. A solid, budget-friendly option is the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Hyperkin-Trooper-Controller-not-machine-specific/dp/B07M5HYTZL?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Hyperkin Trooper</a> for around $18.</p><p>The C64 Mini displays games in 720p resolution in pixel perfect or original 4:3 aspect ratios. You can add scanlines (CRT filter) if you want to replicate the classic look. All preloaded games have four save slots, and you can save your progress at any point.</p><p>Here's the full list of modern Commodore 64 games included on The C64 Mini - Black Edition out of the box. The prices next to each title are what you'd pay on itch.io. Games without prices are available to download for free. As a reminder, these are just the new games; the Black Edition still comes with the original 64 games. </p><p><strong>25 New Games:</strong></p><ul><li>A Pig Quest ($11.61)</li><li>Caren and the Tangled Tentacles (~$80, Physical)</li><li>Galencia ($5)</li><li>Good Kniight ($4)</li><li>Grid Pix ($2)</li><li>Guns 'N' Ghosts ($3)</li><li>Hessian ($2)</li><li>Hunter's Moon Remastered ($5)</li><li>It's Magic 2 ($2.22)</li><li>Joe Gunn: Gold Edition</li><li>Metal Warrior Ultra ($11)</li><li>Millie &amp; Molly ($2)</li><li>Nixy and the Seeds of Doom</li><li>Ooze: The Escape</li><li>p0 Snake</li><li>Pains 'N' Aches ($5)</li><li>Planet Golf (~$43, Physical)</li><li>Rocky Memphis: The Legend of Atlantis ($5)</li><li>Runn 'N' Gunn ($2)</li><li>Sam's Journey ($24)</li><li>Shadow Switcher</li><li>Spinning Image</li><li>Steel Ranger ($5)</li><li>Yeti Mountain ($9)</li></ul><p>You can find plenty of other modern C64 homebrew on itch.io.

<figure data-uuid="0aa4728cae145"><a title="Factorio" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/0aa4728cae145/factorio.large.jpg"></a></figure><p>Since the launch of the Switch 2 in June, many developers have been announcing upgrades for existing Switch releases.</p>
<p>With this in mind, the construction and management title <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/factorio">Factorio</a> will be getting a Nintendo Switch 2 Edition. This title was originally released on the Switch in 2022, and the Switch 2 version will be a free upgrade for existing owners.</p>
<p>If you don't already own the game, there'll be a paid bundle which includes the game and the Switch 2 Edition upgrade. Here are the features you can expect from this upgraded edition for Switch 2:</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067hljtwr&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>837k</span></a></p>
</div></figure></div>
<ul>
<li><em>Better resolution. The game will run on the screen's native 1080p resolution instead of 720p. When docked, it supports all resolutions, including 2160p (4K).</em></li>
<li><em>Variable refresh rate support for the console's screen.</em></li>
<li><em>Some higher quality animations.</em></li>
<li><em>Some higher resolution sprites.</em></li>
<li><em>Other visual improvements.</em></li>
<li><em>Faster loading times.</em></li>
<li><em>Ability to build much larger bases.</em></li>
<li><em>Mouse mode support. Using the Joy-Con Mouse Sensor, the left or right Joy-Con can be used as a mouse.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Along with this, it's also been confirmed <strong><a href="https://wiki.factorio.com/Space_Age">Factorio: Space Age</a></strong> is on its way to the Switch 2, as DLC for $35 (or the regional equivalent). It will include the same content as the PC version. The aim is to get both the Switch 2 Edition and Space Age out by December (before Christmas), but this is "not an official release date" just yet. So when we get a proper date, we'll let you know.</p>
<p>If you're curious to know more about this upcoming release, the developer has also documented the title's "<a href="https://factorio.com/blog/post/fff-439">Journey to the Switch 2</a>" on the official blog, and there is also some extra details about the one year anniversary of Space Age.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">First impressions matter, right? Full Metal Schoolgirl throws you into its third-person shooter action shortly after a blazing fast anime-inspired opening to the tune of a J-rock banger. It immediately establishes its irreverent attitude and goofy anti-capitalist satire in a futuristic world where robots are exploited and referred to as "the working dead" – and with the goal of taking down a CEO villain, I thought to myself, "Hell yeah." But about halfway through a second run of this roguelike, it dawned on me that there just wasn't much to Full Metal Schoolgirl; it’s a dull and repetitive shooter whose gameplay foundations aren't quite good enough to save it from the largely tedious, unrewarding grind up its 100-floor tower.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Full Metal Schoolgirl - Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">During the intro sequence where you break into the evil Maternal Jobz Corporation, you choose to play as Ryoko or Akemi, two cyborg anime girls who are functionally and aesthetically human – the one you pick winds up being the lead character and the other gets captured and plays into the story as you progress. They're seeking revenge on the company and its CEO for working their dad to death, and the story's initial disdain for corporate bullshit is sharp in a way that reminded me of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hi-fi-rush-review"><u>Hi-Fi Rush</u></a>. However, that's as far as it goes before things devolve into annoying quips and no real intrigue to motivate each run; like most parts of Full Metal Schoolgirl, it doesn't build on its good ideas and its shallow execution on them wears thin rather quickly.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I have a high tolerance for anime tropes, and here, it teeters between charming and eyerolling, and more frequently leans toward the latter. It's not just for its crass innuendos, but also in its incessant yapping that doesn't exude any memorable personality into its interesting premise. I'm not here to handwave the attention drawn to upskirts or the creepy actions of the doctor who upgrades your skills, either – it's just unnecessary. The moments its tropes really do work are at the very beginning and the very end, and it's as if everything in between was overlooked in the process, which is where you'll spend most of your time.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Once you've given Full Metal Schoolgirl a couple runs, you've pretty much seen it all.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Each floor is made up of a series of narrow hallways filled with enemy fodder alongside environmental hazards, as well as square office building rooms that function as small combat arenas. The latter throws optional challenges at you like clearing the room within a time limit or without using heals for extra money for upgrades. But this overall formula does not fundamentally change across its 100 procedurally generated floors. The scenery may change slightly for each block of floors, yet the structure stays the same. While they may throw different enemy types at you like drones, bomb-strapped robots, turrets, and mechanized dogs, no amount of mixing and matching them can make up for mediocre implementation. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's easy to see how the procedural generation clashes with itself when certain doors lead to a completely empty room or the combat challenge prompts just don't align with the way encounters are set up. This haphazard level design feels very basic at best and frustratingly messy at worst, and it persists through the large majority of the 14 hours I put into finishing the campaign. Boss fights act as endcaps to blocks of floors, and while they're relatively refreshing after blasting through the same areas over and over again, their attack patterns are quite telegraphed and simple to overcome. Still, I'll take dodging area-of-effect explosions and dumping my ultimates (or Punishment attacks, as it's called) into a spongy boss over thoughtlessly repeating identical floors of enemies, so I do wish these kinds of battles weren't so few and far between.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Defeating a boss grants you a key to start a subsequent run at their floor, which is a godsend to cut through the needless repetition – but, they're one-time-use. If a run goes sideways after using the key and you don't defeat the next boss 20-something floors up for the next key, get ready to start at a much lower level, buddy. While this raises the stakes, as any roguelike worth its salt should do, the disappointment of having to trudge through the most boring parts to make it back to where you left off doesn’t feel worth it. Even though it gets easier on account of upgrading your stats and abilities from the materials and money you earn from each run, ascending chunks of floors still takes a lot of time. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">I was excited that this is an anime-style shooter at least, which is something I've been seeking since <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/freedom-wars-remastered-hands-on-preserving-the-vita-classic-as-you-remember-it">Freedom Wars</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2018/03/03/sword-art-online-fatal-bullet-review">Sword Art Online: Fatal Bullet</a> (which didn't quite capitalize on the premise). More often than not, playing through Full Metal Schoolgirl felt like a chore, but I can appreciate the mindless fun its mechanics sometimes offer. With a handful of specific guns and melee weapons I vibed with, I was able to get into a groove, turn my brain off, and just mow down mobs of enemies. Although most guns are pretty counterintuitive for the way encounters are designed, a high-level electric chaingun or chunky plasma ball launcher carry the right kind of weight and feedback you want from a shooter. That said, movement itself is a little too sticky for this style of game, especially when there are annoying platforming sections. And melee attacks and jumps are a tad unresponsive, even if cutting through a crowd with a katana's dash attack or the Labrys axe's aftershocks can be satisfying.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's moments like these that started to shine though more frequently in the final chunk of floors. The rate at which genuinely challenging encounters presented themselves, and the confluence of weapons that were fun to use showed up, let Full Metal Schoolgirl finish on a higher note than the absolute slog it took to get there. It didn't exactly flip the script or break away from the conventions established at the start, but it began to make the most of its basic pieces by throwing almost everything at you at a brisk pace.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As I progressed, I naturally figured out which types of guns worked for me – slow shotguns and rifles never made sense to use, but a strong SMG that'd overheat quickly became a favorite. Learning to manage my energy meter for big axe combos, dodging, and hoverdashing became more important in the late game. And weaving in your auto-attack drone (which you summon on a cooldown) was key to salvaging a few runs. Being smart with the scarce battery supply (which is your healing item) factored into how I approached combat as well. </p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Michael Higham's 10 Favorite Roguelike/lite Games</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Rarity of gear you're rewarded with from challenge rooms is random, which leads to moments of pointlessness where I'd clear a challenge room only to be met with common level rarity items that pale in comparison to rare and legendary gear from much earlier floors. At least this makes the modifiers meaningful as they can affect how your health, energy, movement, and damage output works, especially when the shields you equip have a sizable impact on your survivability.</p></section><div data-cy="verdict"><h3 data-cy="title3">Verdict</h3><p data-cy="article-verdict-paragraph">Once you've given Full Metal Schoolgirl a couple runs, you've pretty much seen it all. There are decent ideas with potential that meld the shooter genre and roguelike framework well – it's unfortunate that they get squandered by foundational shortcomings. Whether it be a misunderstanding of what makes the genre work or an intentionally derivative take on roguelike games, the loop it creates is woefully repetitive with boring level design. Although I found some mindless fun since its fundamental gameplay is decent and shines a bit brighter towards the very end, it's certainly not good enough to redeem this monotonous shooter. The anime-inspired charm wears thin as its tropes quickly become annoying, even if its premise shows promise. I got into a groove in its final hour as I ascended the last floors with gear and upgrades that were fun to use, but the climb to get there wasn't exactly worth the slog.</p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/full-metal-schoolgirl-review]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The AirPods Pro 2 are still Apple’s flagship earbuds and they sit just one generation behind the recently released Pro 3. Here’s the thing though: the improvements between these two generations are incremental at best and definitely don’t justify paying 30 percent more for the newer model. Right now, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4044/">you can grab the AirPods Pro 2 for just $169, down from their usual $249 price tag</a>. That’s<strong> an all-time low on Amazon</strong> and makes these earbuds three times cheaper than Apple’s over-ear AirPods Max headphones.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4044/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>The first reason listeners are drawn to AirPods Pro 2 is that they fix the problem with listening to audio in noisy settings in the first place. <strong>Noise cancellation in these AirPods is made possible with Apple’s own H2 chip</strong>&nbsp;where it picks up background noise using external microphones and generates anti-noise that effectively cancels it out before it hits your eardrums. The end result is incredibly quiet background noise so that listeners can enjoy their audio with the volume turned down to safe levels rather than competing with background noise.</p>



<h2>Advanced Audio Technology for a Fraction of the Price</h2>
<p>The custom-built driver in each earbud produces<strong> high-fidelity sound with rich bass response</strong>, clear treble, and balanced midrange frequencies that bring out the details in your music. Apple’s Adaptive EQ continuously adjusts the sound profile based on how the earbuds fit in your specific ear shape, which means you get consistent audio quality even if the buds shift slightly during movement. This real-time tuning happens automatically in the background, so you never have to fiddle with manual EQ settings or worry about suboptimal sound. The <strong>personalized spatial audio feature creates an immersive three-dimensional soundstage</strong> that makes audio feel like it’s coming from all around you rather than just two points inside your ears.</p>



<p>The <strong>transparency mode</strong> is one such feature that totally unites the manner in which you use your wireless earbuds in your daily life. You no longer need to physically take out your earbuds every time someone is talking to you or if it is an announcement that you need to pay attention to; rather, with the transparency mode, all you need to do is press the stem, in which case you can immediately understand what is happening around you without having to stop the musical playback in the background, thanks to the external microphones that allow background sounds to seep in while keeping the volume low so that it doesn’t completely pause the playback.</p>
<p>The<strong> hearing aid function is a true innovation</strong> that is more than just an ordinary consumer audio device feature. Following a basic hearing test done by using the app in partnership with the AirPods Pro 2, it is possible to amplify certain frequencies according to your own hearing needs, thus serving as an authentic hearing aid for mild to moderate hearing loss using a clinical-grade level device for the true benefit derived from its usage.</p>
<p>Listening time with the battery is almost six hours with active noise cancellation on, and then<strong> the charging case gives multiple charges for a total playback time of almost 30 hours combined</strong>. The use of USB-C is also a big improvement since it is compatible with charging any other Apple device such as the new iPhone 15 series, iPad, MacBook, and also AirPods with just one cord, thus eliminating cords on your desk or in your backpack. Also, the <strong>charging case is compatible with any Qi-certified charging pad</strong>, plus it is also compatible with the new MagSafe charging devices.</p>
<p>At $169, AirPods Pro 2 provides the essential high-end benefits one would want in a daily listening experience at an affordable price.</p>

                <p>For years, Netflix has told investors that it's serious about investing in the video game industry. But the streamer's ambitions may need to be re-calibrated again. Boss Fight--the studio behind Netflix's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/squid-game-unleashed/" data-ref-id="5000-652368">Squid Game: Unleashed</a> mobile game--has been shut down.</p><p>David Rippy, the CEO and co-founder of Boss Fight, shared the news on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7387225251513827328/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">his LinkedIn page</a>, and shared his gratitude for the experience:</p><p>"Thanks, everyone who reached out today," wrote Rippy. "Rough news, for sure, but I'm very grateful for the time we had at Netflix. We worked with some awesome people and made many games that I'm very proud of, including Squid Game Unleashed, which hit #1 in 26 countries. You'll see lots of Boss Fighters with similar posts. Please consider them if you have any open roles--they are outstanding people and true professionals through-and-through. As for Bill, Scott and me--we're going to take a little breather before tackling whatever is next. Love to hear from you if there's anything interesting going on, workwise or otherwise."</p><p>Last summer, Netflix co-CEO, president, and director Greg Peter indicated that the streamer was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/netflix-to-ramp-up-investment-in-gaming-as-company-addresses-further-monetization-possibilities/1100-6533263/" data-ref-id="1100-6533263">going to "ramp up" its investment in gaming</a> in part to explore new monetization options. Earlier this month, Netflix <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/netflixs-new-batch-of-games-can-be-played-straight-on-your-tv-no-controller-required/1100-6535331/" data-ref-id="1100-6535331">added five new games</a>--Lego Party, Boggle Party, Pictionary: Game Night, Tetris Time Warp, and Party Crashers--that can be played on televisions with your phone as the controller.</p><p>Previously, Netflix had even bigger plans for a AAA multiplayer shooter from a team that included Halo and Destiny veteran Joe Staten. However, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/netflix-shutters-aaa-game-studio-led-by-overwatch-and-halo-vets/1100-6527313/" data-ref-id="1100-6527313">that game and the studio behind it were closed</a> in 2024. Netflix gaming executive Alain Tascan later told <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/netflix-boss-explains-why-company-killed-the-aaa-multiplayer-game-from-halo-veteran/1100-6530293/" data-ref-id="1100-6530293">Bloomberg</a> why the streamer pulled the plug on that project.</p><p>"I don't want this move to be seen as, 'We're not going to do big ambitious games,'" said Tascan. "It was just the genre of the game... I don't think was matching the platform. This team was really good at what they were doing, but we wouldn't have been the best partner for them to express their skills and their expertise."</p>

              <p>Dell laptops typically sit in the premium tier where you’re paying extra for build quality and brand reputation. But every once in a while, the pricing gods smile upon us and something wild happens. Right now, you can grab a fully loaded <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5000/">Dell Inspiron with Windows 11 Pro, a massive 2TB SSD, and 64GB of RAM for just $959, down from its usual $3,699 price tag</a>. That’s a $2,740 discount which makes this the<strong> steepest markdown on any Windows 11 Pro laptop currently available on Amazon</strong>.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5000/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>The configuration here is impressive for anyone who needs serious computing power without compromise: That 64GB of RAM is overkill for casual browsing, sure, but if you’re running virtual machines, editing 4K video footage, juggling dozens of browser tabs while running Adobe Creative Suite, or compiling code, this amount of memory transforms your workflow. You can <strong>keep everything open simultaneously without that dreaded slowdown</strong> when your system starts swapping to disk. The 2TB solid-state drive gives you enough room to store your entire photo library and still have breathing room left over.</p>
<h2>Professional Power That Doesn’t Break the Budget</h2>
<p>The Ryzen 7 7730U processor found in this laptop is an <strong>AMD Zen 3 processor with a boost speed of 4.5 GHz</strong> if the need arises for more power. With eight cores and sixteen threads, it is a multitasking beast with enough power for content generation and even some gaming in between tasks if the need arises. The Ryzen 7 7730U is optimized for performance with power savings in mind, so if your need for it is something that doesn’t require it to be plugged in for extended periods, then it is possible to use it for an extended period without checking the percentage meter like it is a ticking time bomb.</p>



<p>The <strong>15.6-inch touchscreen display has Full HD capabilities with 1920×1080 pixels</strong>, and provides sharp text rendering and picture quality minus the power consumption associated with high-resolution screens. The <em>Wide Viewing Angle</em> feature ensures that the displayed color remains accurate even if the screen is being viewed from an angle, particularly useful during presentation setups where multiple viewers congregate around the screen, making it easier for others to view what is being showcased on the screen. Having an <strong>anti-glare screen</strong> is indeed a welcome feature if your work environment is near a window or under bright office lighting, where it becomes possible to view the screen without the botheration posed by overwhelming reflections.</p>



<p>Windows 11 Pro is an improvement over the last edition in terms of the benefits it offers for professional usage. You enjoy <em>BitLocker</em>-protected storage for secure storage of your files, the ability to connect to other computers using Remote Desktop, allowing access from any location, and joining a domain if you’re connecting from your company’s network. With the “Pro” version Off Windows 11, you have more flexibility with Windows Update so you can delay feature updates so that it doesn’t restart in the middle of a critical operation.</p>
<p>Dell also bundles a comprehensive accessory package with its laptop which actually provides value addition rather than mere inflation in the box. You can expect to get a <strong>stylus pen for operating the touchscreen display, a camera privacy cover for those concerned with security, a 128GB USB storage drive for transferring files quickly, dust plugs for protecting the ports, a laptop sleeve, and even a microfiber cloth</strong> for cleaning the system.</p>
<p>At $959, it’s an historic low for a laptop with such specs coupled with the Windows 11 Pro license.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Obsidian Entertainment's latest role-playing game, The Outer Worlds 2, is here, and there's a lot to do in this new space-faring adventure. The planets you visit have bigger maps to run through, there are more weapons to use and modify, people to meet and talk to, and plenty more.</p>



<p>But there are five things that you should absolutely do first, right when you get off your ship, the Incognito, and touch down on the planet Eden and on Paradise Island. They'll make your playthrough run a lot smoother, and start you off on the right foot.</p>



<h2 id="h-the-outer-worlds-2-guide-do-these-five-things-first">The Outer Worlds 2 Guide - Do These Five Things First</h2>



<h3 id="h-get-the-double-jump">Get the Double Jump</h3>



<figure><figcaption><em>The Outer Worlds 2.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Exploration is a key gameplay element in The Outer Worlds 2, and it becomes a lot easier once you unlock the ability to double jump, which you can do almost immediately when landing on Paradise Island. </p>



<p>It starts by finding Heull Chaundry, a down-on-his-luck Auntie's Choice businessman who was kicked out of the saloon in Fairfield for not being able to pay his tab. Speak to him, and start his sidequest. That'll put you on the path to discovering the P.A.L.E. Boots, which let you double jump.</p>



<p>If you don't speak to Heull or investigate where Ida Rutledge is hiding as you continue through the first major quest of getting into the Vox Relay, then you won't head to Spire Grove, where you can find the boots. Otherwise, you'll run through the whole game without being able to reach certain additional areas, and miss out on extra resources, weapons, armour pickups, etc.</p>



<h3 id="h-get-a-plasma-shock-biomass-weapon">Get a Plasma/Shock/Biomass Weapon</h3>



<figure><figcaption><em>The Outer Worlds 2.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Elemental damage is huge in The Outer Worlds 2. It's far more important to pay attention to weapons that have elemental damage than just their overall damage output. That's why you want to have one in your arsenal as soon as possible. </p>



<p>Whether you choose Shock, Plasma, or Biomass (though personally I'd recommend Shock or Plasma to start), your elemental damaging weapon will be the best weapon in your loadout and help you tear through combat encounters without issue, even when you're just starting out.</p>



<h3 id="h-grab-the-commando-perk-add-an-extra-holster">Grab the Commando Perk/Add an Extra Holster</h3>



<figure><figcaption><em>The Outer Worlds 2.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>You can only choose so many perks on your way to level 30, which is as high as the levelling system goes in The Outer Worlds 2. You don't get to pick a new Perk with every level, so you have to really think carefully about which ones you choose.</p>



<p>Obviously, this is an RPG, and there's technically no wrong answer, but one of the first perks you should pick up, if not the first one, is Commando. It'll unlock a third holster in your loadout, letting you carry three weapons at a time instead of two.</p>



<p>If you don't want to pick Commando, you can still unlock that third weapon holster with the 'Extra Holster' helmet mod that's available at the first vendor you'll find in Fairfield. If you pick Commando and equip a helmet with the Extra Holster mod, you'll be able to carry four weapons at a time.</p>



<p>Whichever way you do it, you'll be far better off with at least three weapons on hand instead of two, since it leaves enough room for weapons with different ammo and damage types, giving you options in combat without having to dig through the menu to switch weapons mid-fight.</p>



<h3 id="h-buy-ammo-crafting-recipes">Buy Ammo Crafting Recipes</h3>



<figure><figcaption><em>The Outer Worlds 2.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>You'll always be able to buy whatever ammo you need at vending machines and vendors in towns, but you might not always have a vending machine nearby when you need it. There might be a workbench, or you might have Niles in your party who is essentially a workbench on the go, but nowhere to buy ammo.</p>



<p>That's why you need to buy crafting recipes for different ammo types as soon as you see them. They should be the first things you buy, even before a new weapon or a new piece of armour. Crafting ammo is only possible if you have the recipe in the first place, so buy all the ammo crafting recipes for the starting ammo types once you make it to Fairfield. Also, as new ammo types appear the deeper into the game you get, make sure to grab those recipes as they become available.</p>



<h3 id="h-get-toxicity-draining-armour">Get Toxicity Draining Armour</h3>



<figure><figcaption><em>The Outer Worlds 2.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Your Inhaler is the only method of healing you have while in the middle of a fight, even if you have swaths of food resources that can heal you. You can't eat mid-combat, so those resources can't help you. You have to use your Inhaler, but using it increases your toxicity levels.</p>



<p>Those levels decrease over time as the toxicity drains, but the time you wait can be the difference between surviving a fight or not, depending on if you're able to get to cover quickly.</p>



<p>Your toxicity can drain faster than the standard rate, and the easiest way to do that without putting points into skills and perks that'll help with your toxicity drain is by wearing armour that increases your toxicity drain. This is a feature you'll be able to find with certain helmets, and it's worth wearing them for this exact reason.</p>



<p>Also, it's worth it to get better armour in general. Your starting armour isn't very protective, and whether you buy it from the vendor in Fairfield or take it off a corpse, you'll want to grab new armour as soon as you can to help you survive.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/halo-campaign-evolved-announced-for-2026-coming-to-xbox-series-pc-and-playsation-5</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/halo-campaign-evolved-announced-for-2026-coming-to-xbox-series-pc-and-playsation-5.1334605/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Microsoft is keen to revive the Halo series for the current generation with an all-new take on the classic <em>Halo: Combat Evolved</em> for Xbox Series X|S, PC, Steam, and PlayStation 5 for the first time. The announcement of <em>Halo: Campaign Evolved</em> marks a faithful and modernized remake of the original story rebuilt on a modern engine with high-definition visuals, updated cinematics and controls, and three brand-new prequel missions starring Master Chief and Sgt. Johnson. This new version of the game will also include a broader cache of weapons, vehicles, enemies, and gameplay-modifying Skulls - operational mods that can alter combat in challenging ways and increase replayability.</p>

<p><em>Halo: Campaign Evolved</em> is exactly what its title suggests - focused on the original Halo campaign. That means on console, 2-player split screen will satisfy the multiplayer requirement, while up to 4 people can play co-op online with full crossplay and cross-progression support enabled.&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>Halo: Campaign Evolved</em> promises the original missions, but rebuilt with enhanced level design, updated cinematics, and improved wayfinding to keep the pace moving. The soundtrack has also been remastered with sound design updated for better immersion, and new voice performances have been recorded with the main cast.</p>

<p>On the gameplay side of things, <em>Halo: Campaign Evolved</em> has made adjustments to sprint, aiming, and for the first time, the ability to wield nine iconic weapons from across the Halo series including the Energy Sword, Battle Rifle, and Needle Rifle. The new prequel missions also introduce a new gameplay arc with new environments, characters, and enemies.Vehicle gameplay is enhanced too with the ability to hijack enemy rides and pilot a fully controllable Wraith for the first time.</p>

<p>The first look at <em>Halo: Campaign Evolved</em> can be seen in action with the reveal trailer linked below. The current release window is set for sometime in 2026.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/amazon-is-offloading-this-60000mah-power-bank-for-pennies-ankers-stock-is-flying-off-the-shelves-2000638972</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/amazon-is-offloading-this-60-000mah-power-bank-for-pennies-anker%E2%80%99s-stock-is-flying-off-the-shelves.1334593/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The little 10,000mAh power banks you see everywhere are fine for topping up your phone once, maybe twice if you’re lucky. But when you’re camping for the weekend, dealing with a power outage or spending a full day at an outdoor event, that tiny capacity just doesn’t cut it. You need serious juice, and that’s exactly what the Anker <em>PowerCore</em> delivers. Right now, Amazon <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4144/">has slashed this beast of a power bank from $149 down to just $79</a>, which is an all-time low for a device packing a <strong>massive 60,000mAh capacity</strong>.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4144/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>The 60,000mAh capacity translates to <strong>192 watt-hours of stored energy</strong> which means you can charge an iPhone 17 more than 10 times over or keep a 3-watt LED lamp running for over 42 hours straight. That’s the difference between fumbling in the dark during a blackout and having reliable lighting for nearly two full days. The <strong>dual USB-C ports deliver 60 watts and 27 watts respectively</strong> so you can fast-charge a laptop and a smartphone at the same time without sacrificing speed.</p>
<h2>A Backup Generator That Fits in Your Backpack</h2>
<p>Anker built this power station with emergencies in mind and it’s apparent in its design. There’s a built-in light on top of the power station that’s retractable; it’s incredibly bright which makes it perfect for nighttime campsite setups or traveling during power outages. Still, the feature that stands out in terms of safety is its dedicated SOS button for an emergency strobe light function. The intelligent display screen on the front lets users know exactly what their power levels, wattage output, and time left are, so they’re never surprised by a power level status they can’t gauge on their own in the absence of wall power access.</p>



<p>The solar panel compatibility is what elevates it from a mere power bank to a off-grid system on its own: You can hook up a compatible solar panel via the input socket to charge it using only sunlight which is fantastic for long camping ventures or readiness systems for power outages. Charging the system is quite easy; simply hook up the USB-C to USB-C charging cord to a wall socket so it only takes 5-6 hours using your wall socket’s wattage, which is quite acceptable for such massive capacity.</p>



<p>As for the build quality, it’s definitely robust without being completely bulky either. Of course, it’s a bit heavier, thanks to the presence of battery cells but it is something that can be easily thrown into a backpack or even into an auto-emergency kit in your car, if need be. The build quality appears to be more resilient to rough handling, which is quite an aspect if one is supposed to be using it outdoors, say in an RV during an adventure vacation. Anker warrants it with a three-year warranty, which is an assurance on their own part regarding its durability.</p>
<p>At $79, <strong>this deal represents a 47 percent discount</strong> and brings the price per watt-hour down to an incredibly competitive level. Most portable power stations in this capacity range still hover around $120 to $200 so catching this at under $80 is fantastic.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-library-level-is-%E2%80%98being-fixed%E2%80%99-for-halo-campaign-evolved.1334590/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The worst level in Halo: Combat Evolved is getting some much-needed changes in Halo: Campaign Evolved.</p>



<p>Announced at the Halo World Championships,&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/halo-combat-evolved-remake-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Halo: Campaign Evolved</a>&nbsp;remakes the 2001 classic Halo: Combat Evolved. The game will tell the original story of Master Chief and Cortana beating the Covenant and saving the universe. As a campaign-only title, the game is set to release in 2026 for Xbox Series X|S, PC, and, for the first time ever,&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/halo-campaign-evolved-remake-playstation-announcement-xbox-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PlayStation 5</a>. With excitement about the gameplay alive and well, the team told Xbox Wire about a change to the controversial Library level.</p>



<h2 id="h-halo-campaign-evolved-is-changing-the-library-level-developers-confirm">Halo: Campaign Evolved is Changing The Library Level, Developers Confirm</h2>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Halo: Campaign Evolved | The Silent Cartographer Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/efThjRym-ks?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>In <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/10/24/halo-campaign-evolved-answering-the-big-questions/">a blog post from Xbox Wire</a>, members of Halo: Campaign Evolved’s development team spoke on the remake. Max Szlagor, the game’s Creative Director, talked about changes being made to certain levels that weren’t done for the Anniversary Edition. Chief among them was the dreaded Library level. Speaking on it, Szlagor said,</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“We learned from&nbsp;<em>Halo: Combat Evolved Anniversary</em>&nbsp;that there was still an appetite for things like better wayfinding, navigation, and diversity in enemy encounters,” Szlagor states <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/10/24/halo-campaign-evolved-answering-the-big-questions/">in the blog</a>. “In The Library specifically, which features several Flood encounters, we wanted to reevaluate the pacing and enhance the environmental storytelling. We’ve added new lines to Guilty Spark, which guide players through the level, and there’s new dialogue that gives more insight into the narrative as it plays out. We’re not changing the stories, it’s about refining and adding context to this moment, and other levels like it, so players can stay on track.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>If you played Halo: Combat Evolved, you know how annoying The Library level is. Countless droves of The Flood and horrible level design made it a challenging chore. Fortunately, new fans, like those on PlayStation, won’t have to suffer much. Plus, with new dialogue for Guilty Spark, the intriguing lore will get the justice it deserves. From developer comments, a lot of changes are in the works for the game, so returning players will have new content to look forward to.</p>



<p>Are you happy to see The Library getting changes for Halo: Campaign Evolved? What are your feelings about the level? Will you be getting the remake? Let us know in the comments and on <a href="https://discord.gg/Bhv3AMa5a9" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the official Insider Gaming Discord</a>!</p>

              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/halo-1-remake-combat-evolved-trailer-hwc-teaser-xbox-ps5-2000638911">The newly revealed </a><em>Halo: Campaign Evolved,</em> an Unreal Engine 5 remake of 2001’s <em>Halo</em>, isn’t just a graphical update of the original game. The devs are making some big changes to the classic <em>Halo</em> experience, and this includes changing levels. And yes, if you were wondering, The Library is one of the levels getting tweaked.</p> <p>Ask 100 random <em>Halo</em> fans what the worst level in the first game is, and 90 or more will likely say “The Library.” This late-in-story level is very long, filled with never-ending waves of Flood, aka space zombies, and has limited supplies, checkpoints, and waypoints. It also lacks visual variety and can be a dull experience on lower difficulties and a pain in the ass for those playing on higher difficulties who enter unprepared. To help players in 2025, Halo Studios is making some changes to <em>Halo’s</em> infamously annoying level.</p>

 <p><a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/10/24/halo-campaign-evolved-answering-the-big-questions/">In an October 24 blog post</a>, Halo Studios and Xbox explained that with Library, “it felt right to make tweaks to several areas” to create a “new experience that balances nostalgia with the expectations of today’s gamers.”</p>

 <p>“We learned from&nbsp;<em>Halo: Combat Evolved Anniversary</em> that there was still an appetite for things like better wayfinding, navigation, and diversity in enemy encounters,” said <em>Halo </em>creative director Matt Szlagor. “In The Library specifically, which features several Flood encounters, we wanted to reevaluate the pacing and enhance the environmental storytelling. We’ve added new lines to Guilty Spark, which guide players through the level, and there’s new dialogue that gives more insight into the narrative as it plays out.”</p>

 <p>He further added: &nbsp;“We’re not changing the stories, it’s about refining and adding context to this moment, and other levels like it, so players can stay on track.”</p> <p><a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/rs-gaming/halo-campaign-evolved-remake-impressions-1235451111/">Speaking to <em>Rolling Stone</em>,</a> executive producer Damon Conn claimed that every mission, encounter, and cinematic in <em>Halo: Combat Evolved</em> has been “rebuilt and retouched with the spirit intact of the original’s awe, sense of discovery, and heroism.” Hopefully, that means the Library won’t look like the same boring grey corridors over and over again for 20 minutes.</p> <p><em>Halo: Campaign Evolved</em> launches on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC in 2026.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Halo, once the flagship Xbox exclusive, the video game Microsoft launched its first console with, has finally jumped ship. Microsoft has announced Halo: Campaign Evolved — a remake of the original game’s campaign — and it’s coming to PlayStation 5 day one.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Unreal Engine 5 remake of the Bungie-developed 2001 campaign is set for launch in 2026 on PC, Xbox Series X and S, and, crucially, PS5. It is the first new Halo game since 2021’s Halo Infinite, and the first Halo ever to release on a PlayStation console. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/halo-campaign-evolved-announced-for-xbox-pc-and-yes-ps5-heres-everything-we-know-so-far-including-new-missions">IGN has played Halo: Campaign Evolved and has all the details right here</a>, including first info on the new three-mission prequel story arc. And yes, if you were wondering, there’s crossplay, which means Xbox, PC, and PlayStation owners can play Halo co-op together for the first time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Halo: Campaign Evolved is the final nail in the coffin for the Xbox exclusive, then, although in truth the shooter series’ release on PlayStation does not come as any surprise. Xbox Game Studios is already one of the most prolific and successful publishers on PlayStation, and just this week <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-idea-of-locking-it-to-one-store-or-one-device-is-antiquated-for-most-people-xbox-president-says-microsoft-is-seeing-players-evolve-way-past-big-blockbuster-exclusive-games">Xbox president Sarah Bond called the idea of exclusive games “antiquated,”</a> so Microsoft’s thinking on this is crystal clear.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">But what has prompted Microsoft’s multiplatform push? A recent <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-10-23/microsoft-pushes-xbox-studios-to-hit-higher-profit-margins" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bloomberg</a> report alleged that Microsoft is pushing Xbox studios to deliver a 30% margin — much higher than the industry average — and one of the ways studios can help bring in more money is by releasing their games on rival platforms, such as PlayStation and Nintendo Switch as well as PC.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">One prominent critic of the exclusive is former president and CEO of Sony Interactive Entertainment America Shawn Layden, who <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ex-playstation-boss-shawn-layden-says-exclusivity-is-your-achilles-heel-if-game-costs-exceed-200-million"><u>last year said that when a video game’s costs exceed $200 million, “exclusivity is your Achilles’ heel.”</u></a></p><p data-cy="paragraph">“It reduces your addressable market,” Layden told <a href="https://gamesbeat.com/how-former-playstation-boss-views-gamings-tumultuous-time-shawn-layden-interview/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>GamesBeat</u></a>, before citing the success of Arrowhead’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/helldivers-ii"><u>Helldivers 2</u></a>, which launched on PlayStation 5 and PC to explosive success. “Particularly when you’re in the world of live service gaming or free-to-play. Another platform is just another way of opening the funnel, getting more people in. In a free-to-play world, as we know, 95% of those people will never spend a nickel. The business is all about conversion. You have to improve your odds by cracking the funnel open. Helldivers 2 has shown that for PlayStation, coming out on PC at the same time. Again, you get that funnel wider. You get more people in.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Layden said single-player games have a similar audience consideration as multiplayer games, though not exactly the same. “For single-player games it’s not the same exigency,” he said. “But if you’re spending $250 million, you want to be able to sell it to as many people as possible, even if it’s just 10% more.”</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Halo: Campaign Evolved – First Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Layden’s comments echo those of former Xbox boss Peter Moore, who in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-will-be-debating-right-now-whether-xbox-consoles-have-a-future-says-peter-moore"><u>a recent interview with IGN</u></a> suggested Microsoft will be debating internally whether to release Xbox poster-child Halo on PlayStation.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“If Microsoft says, wait, we're doing $250 million on our own platforms, but if we then took Halo as, let's call it a third-party, we could do a billion… You got to think long and hard about that, right?” Moore said. “I mean, you just got to go, yeah, should it be kept? It's a piece of intellectual property. It's bigger than just a game. And how do you leverage that? Those are the conversations that always happen with, how do you leverage it in everything that we would do?”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Microsoft’s stance on exclusives has become one of the biggest talking points in the Xbox community, and that conversation will only grow louder now we know Halo has made the jump to PlayStation. Microsoft’s approach is in stark contrast to Nintendo and Sony’s. Nintendo has the most hardline policy on its games, releasing them on its consoles only. Sony has softened its approach in recent years, releasing its multiplayer, live service games on PC at the same time as PlayStation (and in the case of Helldivers 2, eventually on Xbox). But Sony still refuses to launch its big single-player games on anything other than PlayStation day one (the latest example of this is Sucker Punch's Ghost of Yotei).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now Campaign Evolved is confirmed for PS5, there is no going back for Halo. Indeed, it seems Halo is from this day forward as much a PlayStation game as it is an Xbox game. Speaking tonight on a panel at the Halo World Championships 2025, Halo Community Director, Brian Jarrard, teased: "It's really a new era. Halo is on PlayStation going forward, starting with Halo: Campaign Evolved."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Be sure to check out <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/halo-project-update-2025-everything-announced-updating-live">everything announced at Halo Studios’ Halo: Campaign Evolved panel for more</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/halo-campaign-evolved-is-a-pretty-remake-coming-to-ps5-but-not-an-exact-one</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/halo-campaign-evolved-is-a-pretty-remake-coming-to-ps5-but-not-an-exact-one.1334566/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">I honestly wasn’t sure what to expect when I sat down in front of an Xbox Series X to play an early demo of Halo: Campaign Evolved, the just-announced Unreal Engine 5 remake of the original-Xbox killer app (and yes, it’s a proper remake, not a remaster like Halo Anniversary was). And I’m honestly still not sure exactly how I feel about it after playing it. I definitely wanted to be blown away by the visuals, in the same way that the original Halo: Combat Evolved knocked my socks off back in 2001. Heck, we know Unreal Engine 5 is fully capable! I also didn’t want Halo Studios (nee 343 Industries) to mess with too much. Or did I? Would Halo 1 just feel old no matter what? And will PlayStation 5 gamers even care about this 25-year-old Xbox classic when it hits Sony’s consoles for the first time ever, day-and-date with Xbox and PC? So I went in with lots of questions, and I left with, well…some answers. Let me explain.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I suppose we might as well start with the obvious: how it looks. Is my face properly melted? No. But maybe yours is? I’ll be curious to read the comments on this one. Anyway, Campaign Evolved does look very nice, no doubt. It certainly doesn’t look like it’s two decades old anymore. I played a chunk of the legendary Silent Cartographer mission from early in the campaign, and the skybox is beautiful, the water looks great, the trees look very nice, and the terrain texture looks sharp and clean. Once you get indoors, the alien architecture has a unique sheen to it that the original obviously never had. Meanwhile, the weapons all look exactly how you’d expect them to look in the modern era, and the Grunts, Jackals, Elites, and Hunters all look convincingly new rather than reskins of quarter-century-old creatures. Everything looks clean, but not in a soulless way. At least not to me. It works as a cohesive art-directed space in the new engine. I appreciate that VO from the principal actors (read: Steve Downes and Jen Taylor, at the very least) has been rerecorded, while mocap has all been redone for the rebuilt-from-scratch cutscenes. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Halo: Campaign Evolved – First Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">But let’s talk about my biggest concern coming into this demo: the classic Halo feel. Movement, aiming, jumping, vehicle controls – it’s all got to have that semi-floaty Halo feel to it, and I’m pleased to report that even in this very early state, Campaign Evolved is a good bit of the way there. No doubt they’ll continue to tweak it over the coming months – this release has no official release date beyond “2026,” by the way, but I’d be stunned if it’s not timed to release at or very near the 25th anniversary of Halo: Combat Evolved in November of next year – but there have been some gameplay modernizations implemented here that have been ported back from subsequent Halos into this remake, and while purists might bristle at it, most of these seem like they’re for the best for a 2026 first-person shooter release.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Vehicles are boardable and destructible now.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">For starters, vehicles are boardable and destructible now, as they were in subsequent Halo games. That means a Ghost can no longer torment you endlessly, nor are you effectively invulnerable in a Scorpion tank. On a related note, a fourth player can now sit on the back of a Warthog. Oh, and though I didn’t get to try it out on The Silent Cartographer, the Wraith is drivable now, too, as it first became in Halo 2. Also, any weapons the bad guys wield, you can too. As such, the Energy Sword is now in your toolbelt if you take one off the corpse of a Gold Elite. Halo Studios says there will be eight weapons in Campaign Evolved that aren’t new to Halo but are usable for the first time in Master Chief’s first adventure. On the movement front, sprint has also been added. It’s not on a cooldown; you can run endlessly. I could see this one annoying the Halo 1 purists most of all, but not only do the developers say you can turn it off, but you can also just…not use it. I found it handy when running down the beach back towards my mission objective after wandering off to go stare at more of the new Unreal Engine 5-rendered spaces. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">What about co-op? After Halo Studios fumbled that in Halo Infinite, you’re probably wondering about it for the remake. Two-player split-screen is confirmed, though sadly it wasn’t available in my short preview build, and the development team also promises four-player online co-op with full cross-play and cross-progression support. As for proper competitive multiplayer, though? Unfortunately, the answer to that is right in the name of this remake: Campaign Evolved. There’s no multiplayer here, which is a shame because it’d sure be fun to see Blood Gulch or Sidewinder or Hang ‘Em High in Unreal Engine 5 with online cross-play support. I asked Halo Studios about this, and Executive Producer Damon Conn gave me an extremely media-trained answer, saying the team is “very focused on recreating the original campaign that started it all” and “[Halo] Infinite and [Master Chief Collection] provide really great experiences for multiplayer.” Sure…for Xbox and PC players. That doesn’t help new PS5 players fall in love with Halo’s glorious multiplayer, though. Presumably they didn’t want to pull any players away from MCC for this, and/or adding full multiplayer support would’ve likely meant the project couldn’t get done in time for the 25th anniversary. But it’s still disappointing. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">That led me to wonder about pricing. Would this be a full-price $70 release (or perhaps even $80 by the time it comes out, since Microsoft already tried to push to that price point this year)? Or will it be priced lower – particularly since it’s campaign-only? The Halo Studios team wouldn’t say when I asked them directly, so that remains to be seen. Personally, $50 feels right for this, but that’s just my opinion. I also think that $20 per month feels like the right price for Xbox Game Pass Ultimate… </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">OK, so no multiplayer, but there is one significant addition I’m legitimately excited about: a new three-mission prequel campaign that revolves around Master Chief and Sergeant Johnson. This could be extremely cool, but unfortunately that’s literally all we know so far. In fact, Halo Studios wouldn’t even tell me if it’s accessible out of the box or if you have to complete the campaign in order to unlock it. I also asked if they’d be repurposing existing music from the Halo 1 soundtrack to score those missions, or if they might commission something new (dare I dream they reach out to Marty O’Donnell himself!), and they didn’t have an answer for me there either.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Getting back to gameplay, I must say that I still had fun hooning across the beaches of The Silent Cartographer in a Warthog, my UNSC Marine buddies in the passenger and gunner seats helping to mow down Covenant bad guys while I attempted to turn them into hood ornaments with my front bumper. Just like old times. I also manned the gun turret at one point to test out the friendly AI and…it still needs work. In fact, someone on the development team acknowledged this later without me bringing it up, so it’s clearly something they’re aware of. Honestly, though, it’s not something I’m even worried about when there’s still (probably) upwards of a year of development time left. It’s the same with the framerate: no doubt some folks went straight to the comments to note any inconsistencies they saw (because I definitely noticed some), and while it is certainly important, it’s not something I’m sweating this far away from the end of the project. </p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/10/23/hce-general-4k-07-1761260005069.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Oh, and I should also mention that Halo Studios is adding Skulls to Campaign Evolved. Lots of them, in fact. “Dozens” was the word they used, with an emphasis on this remake having the most Skulls of any Halo campaign ever. Replayability is clearly a focus for the studio here – which is understandable, given Halo’s strong history in that department as well as the lack of adversarial multiplayer – and hopefully the Skulls will spice things up for Xbox players running through this thing for the umpteenth time. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Halo Studios says this remake having the most Skulls of any Halo campaign ever.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">On that note, I couldn’t help but wonder if PlayStation 5 players getting their first crack at Halo are really going to care about this in a way that turns a lot of them into new fans of the franchise. It’s a genuine question; I’ve got a lot of personal history with Halo, so I simply can’t answer this one. For someone with no nostalgia for Master Chief, will those players find Campaign Evolved as compelling as I found Combat Evolved? And if they do, then what? Will Halo Studios remake Halo 2 in Unreal Engine 5? And then 3? 4? 5? Reach? ODST? Infinite? Or will they just port The Master Chief Collection and Halo Infinite to PS5 to catch those players up? I asked the team about this and again got a very media-trained half-answer: “There is an opportunity for us to grow the fanbase,” Executive Producer Damon Conn told me. “We're bringing the most players, we believe, to Halo, ever. And so that growth is what we're truly interested in, and again, I hinted before this paves the way for future stories and Halos.”</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/10/24/hce-warthong-4k-03-1761333970798.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">And so, as you can now see, I’m still left with many unanswered questions about this remake project. But to Halo Studios' credit, this early demo did answer a couple of key ones about how good it could look and how Halo-y it could feel. So far so good there. I’m very excited about the new three-mission prequel campaign featuring Sergeant Johnson, as it will be the first new single-player content in a Halo game in, by that point, five years. Can Campaign Evolved relight Halo’s spark? That’s the biggest question of all, and it’ll have to remain unanswered for a bit longer.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Ryan McCaffrey is IGN's executive editor of previews and host of both IGN's weekly Xbox show, </em><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/watch/unlocked">Podcast Unlocked</a><em>, as well as our monthly(-ish) interview show, </em><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2016/02/04/ign-unfiltered-every-episode-ever">IGN Unfiltered</a><em>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Halo Studios has created something special for the 25th anniversary of <em>Halo </em>next year. <em>Halo: Campaign Evolved</em> is a full remake of the original <em>Combat Evolved</em> that launched alongside Microsoft’s first Xbox console in 2001. It has a fully rebuilt campaign with 4K visuals, new weapons and vehicles, a four-player online co-op mode, and brand-new story content.</p><p>And it’s all coming to the Xbox Series X / S, PC, and — for the first time — PlayStation 5 in 2026.</p><p>I’ve been playing a prerelease demo section of The Silent Cartographer mission this week to get a feel for all the changes. It’s the same level that was used as the demo version of <em>Halo: Combat Evolved</em> for both Mac and PC, but this remade version opens immediately with updated cinematics, improved voice lines, and greatly overhauled visuals and animations.</p><p>It looks and feels distinctively <em>Halo</em>, but then I started sprinting toward a rebuilt Warthog that has an extra seat at the rear and I realized there’s a lot going on in <em>Campaign Evolved</em> beyond its Unreal Engine 5-powered visuals.</p><p>“We did this work on <a href="https://halo.fandom.com/wiki/Halo:_Combat_Evolved_Anniversary"><em>Halo</em> <em>Anniversary</em></a>. There were certain things that we weren’t able to achieve at that time, there were certain things we weren’t able to do,” says Greg Hermann, technical director at Halo Studios. “As we were building this out, we didn’t just put a coat of paint over the original cinematics. We ended up revisiting exactly how they were blocked out, how they were sequenced, and how they were put together. We’ve done that across the board.”</p><p>Halo Studios even brought in the core voice actors of <em>Combat Evolved</em> to re-record their lines. It was something I noticed immediately as The Silent Cartographer mission loaded in. “This really provides a degree of fidelity that we weren’t able to do for <em>Halo</em> <em>Anniversary</em>,” says Hermann.</p><p>The iconic vistas in <em>Halo </em>have also been rebuilt, as well as the alien architecture and environments. It’s really designed to be the ultimate remake of the original campaign that’s both welcoming to new players and also built in a way that respects Bungie’s original creation and story.</p><p>“Whenever we make a change, the number one thing is to be true to the original game,” says Dan Gniady, lead game designer at Halo Studios. Gniady joined Halo Studios last year and previously worked on the original releases of Bungie’s <em>Destiny </em>and <em>Destiny 2 </em>titles.</p><p>Halo Studios has access to the original source assets and code for <em>Halo</em>, as well as the original storyboards. That’s allowed the team to remaster and remix the music alongside the cinematic change and huge visual upgrades. All of the new content in the game is created in UE5, and it’s layered on top of the systems and code used for the original game to maintain that unique <em>Halo</em> feel.</p><p><em>Campaign Evolved </em>includes three new bonus missions. “It was really important that we preserved the original story as it is, so these missions are meant to be a prequel setup for the main chorus,” says Max Szlagor, studio design director at Halo Studios. “These new missions are going to offer some new opportunities for character interactions between Chief and Johnson.” The missions will include new environments, gameplay, characters, and enemies.</p><p>There are also new mechanics and AI behaviors. Perhaps the most obvious is the ability to sprint in the game, which makes everything from combat to moving around missions feel a lot faster. There’s even a new seat in the Warthog, affectionately referred to as the golf cart seat or bumper seat by Halo Studios’ developers. It will be ideal for co-op missions, as someone can now hang off the rear of the Warthog.</p><p>Up to four people can play this campaign together online, regardless of what platform they’re on, thanks to crossplay and shared progression across console and PC. There’s also two-player split-screen co-op local play on consoles, just like the original game. “We will make some of the spaces larger, and we also want to make sure we’re authentic to the encounters themselves,” says Szlagor. “So it’s a balancing act between that difficulty tuning and making those encounters the right size for the right space.”</p><div><p><figcaption><em>Halo Studios has rebuilt every part of the original game so movement, aiming, and weapons and look and feel like a modern </em>Halo<em> game.</em></figcaption></p></div><p>All of the weapons have been remodeled and rebuilt with higher fidelity, so the look, feel, and sound of weapons is far better than what Halo Studios achieved with the remastered versions; the plasma effects from guns will even fully light up the indoor environments. You can also aim down sights with all guns now, and there are nine additional weapons from across the <em>Halo </em>series available in <em>Campaign Evolved</em> — including the ability to pick up an Energy Sword after you’ve killed an Elite. If you’re a fan of the vehicles in <em>Halo</em>, you’ll even be able to hijack enemy ones, so you can pilot a fully drivable Wraith in this campaign.</p><p>If you want to amp up the difficultly, Halo Studios is leaning even more on skulls in this remake, the gameplay modifiers from <em>Halo: The Master Chief Collection</em>. There are dozens of skull options in <em>Campaign Evolved</em>, “the most we’ve ever had in a <em>Halo </em>game,” says Szlagor. There are so many that the developers don’t think it will even be possible to complete the game on legendary mode with all skulls turned on. “There’s a lot, so if you can do a true legendary all-skulls-on run, let us know because I’d love to see it,” says Gniady. I’m sure a hardcore <em>Halo </em>fan will find a way next year, though.</p><div><p><figcaption><em>Halo Studios has remade entire environments in </em>Campaign Evolved<em>.</em></figcaption></p></div><p>The one thing that’s missing from <em>Campaign Evolved</em> is multiplayer. The original game had local multiplayer and maps, but it launched before Xbox Live, so there was never any official online multiplayer. While the PC version added online play, Halo Studios is sticking purely to the campaign element of the original <em>Halo </em>game. The <em>Halo </em>franchise is known for its multiplayer, but this really started with <em>Halo 2</em>. I did ask Microsoft to comment about the lack of multiplayer, but the company refused to discuss it.</p><p>Even without multiplayer, <em>Campaign Evolved</em> is a blueprint for future <em>Halo </em>games. “For future titles, we will continue to push the boundaries of technology while ensuring the core <em>Halo </em>gameplay for that game can be seen, felt, heard, and evolved where needed,” says Hermann.</p><p><em>Halo: Campaign Evolved</em> is coming in 2026 to the Xbox Series X / S, PC, and PS5. It’ll be a day one game with Game Pass Ultimate / PC Game Pass, and will also support Xbox Cloud Gaming and Xbox Play Anywhere.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTY0"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Tom Warren</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/805174/halo-campaign-evolved-remake-xbox-ps5-release-date]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/halo-remake-campaign-evolved-playstation-cross-play-2000638951</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/microsoft-confirms-halo-will-be-on-playstation-%E2%80%98going-forward%E2%80%99.1334506/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Today, Microsoft and Halo Studios announced they’re remaking the original&nbsp;<em>Halo&nbsp;</em>again as&nbsp;<a href="https://kotaku.com/halo-1-remake-combat-evolved-trailer-hwc-teaser-xbox-ps5-2000638911"><em>Halo: Campaign Evolved</em></a>. The remake is sprucing up the shooter’s campaign, adding three new prequel levels, and will support up to four-player cooperative runs. The biggest news out of the announcement, however, is that the game is also coming to PlayStation 5, and it sounds like Master Chief’s adventures will also be coming to PlayStation for the foreseeable future.</p> <p>This was confirmed on a livestream from the Halo World Championship after the remake’s announcement. Halo Studios community director Brian “ske7ch” Jarrard said that&nbsp;<em>Halo&nbsp;</em>is a multiplatform series “going forward.” The remake supports crossplay between platforms, so if you want to get your old co-op buddies together after 25 years, you can do that no matter what system they’re playing on. And it sounds like that will be the case with future games, as well.</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Confirmed: Halo will be on PlayStation "going forward" starting with the Combat Evolved remake. <a href="https://t.co/y23v1B3mfV">pic.twitter.com/y23v1B3mfV</a></p> <p>— AmericanTruckSongs9 (@ethangach) <a href="https://twitter.com/ethangach/status/1981827679667290555?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 24, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>In a post on the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/10/24/halo-campaign-evolved-launches-on-ps5-in-2026/">PlayStation Blog</a>, Jarrad teased that Halo Studios may have more&nbsp;<em>Halo&nbsp;</em>announcements for PlayStation 5 owners in the future, saying, “As the Master Chief once said: ‘I think we’re just getting started.'” If the series is coming to a new audience this many entries in, I wouldn’t be surprised if we also see the <em>Master Chief Collection&nbsp;</em>on PlayStation in the coming years. The compilation includes all the&nbsp;<em>Halo&nbsp;</em>games up to&nbsp;<em>5: Guardians</em>, including the spin-offs&nbsp;<em>Reach&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>3: ODST</em>, which don’t follow Master Chief but instead tell separate stories in Bungie and Halo Studios’ sci-fi universe. This would also be as good a time as any to bring <em>Guardians</em> and&nbsp;<em>Infinite</em>, the two most recent games in the series which aren’t included in the collection, to PlayStation 5 as well.</p> <p>All of this comes after <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-microsoft-price-hike-game-pass-layoffs-new-console-2000638546">reports of Microsoft enforcing new profit goals</a> on its Xbox division, seemingly resulting in a complete rethinking of the gaming brand’s direction.</p>

We also covered all kinds of news, like <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2025/10/23/brutal-co-op-beat-em-up-terrifier-the-artcade-game-gets-november-release-date">the release date for Terrifier: The ARTcade Game</a> (which is launching in November and not October for some reason), the <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2025/10/23/elden-rings-debut-on-switch-2-delayed-to-2026">Elden Ring Switch 2 edition getting delayed to 2026</a> (sadness), <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2025/10/22/marvel-cosmic-invasion-gets-december-launch-date-and-adds-phoenix-and-iron-man">Marvel Cosmic Invasion's December release date,</a> and <a href="https://gameinformer.com/nintendo-direct/2025/10/23/everything-we-learned-about-kirby-air-riders-in-todays-nintendo-direct">a massive round-up</a> of everything revealed in Masahiro Sakurai's hour-long Kirby Air Riders direct (it's so much information, y'all).&nbsp;</p>
