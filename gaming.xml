            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/heihachi-mishima-comes-to-tekken-8-as-dlc-this-fall.933546/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/tekken-8-dlc-heihachi<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The next&nbsp;<em>Tekken 8&nbsp;</em>DLC character has been revealed, and it's none other than Mishima family patriarch and all-around maniac Heihachi Mishima, who's been with the series since its very first installment.</p>
<p>Heihachi will arrive sometime this fall as&nbsp;<em>Tekken 8</em>'s third DLC fighter, joining previous additions <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/tekken-8-eddy-gordo-release-date">Eddy Gordo</a> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/tekken-8-lidia-release-date">Lidia Sobieska</a>, who were added to the roster in spring and summer respectively.</p>
<p>Following that, one more DLC character will arrive, although we don't know who it's going to be yet. Unlike other fighting games,&nbsp;<em>Tekken 8&nbsp;</em>hasn't even given its last DLC fighter a silhouette, so we can't make any educated guesses either.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/tekken-8-heihachi-fire.jpg?itok=A8UROApR 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/tekken-8-heihachi-fire.jpg?itok=AguhvCzQ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Heihachi is back in&nbsp;<em>Tekken 8</em>, and he's not best pleased.</figcaption></figure><p>If you've played the story mode for&nbsp;<em>Tekken 7</em>, then you'd be forgiven for thinking that Heihachi's return in this game was an impossibility, but his trailer does sort of address that issue.</p>
<p>Spoiler alert: at the end of&nbsp;<em>Tekken 7</em>, having been defeated once and for all by Kazuya, Heihachi's body is tossed into a volcano. At the end of his&nbsp;<em>Tekken 8&nbsp;</em>introduction trailer, though, we see him standing amidst the fire and brimstone of said volcano, laughing maniacally.</p>
<p>It's not entirely clear how Heihachi survived his fight with Kazuya, but I'm sure that we'll get some sort of explanation when he arrives in&nbsp;<em>Tekken 8</em>. At this stage, is there really any point in fighting game roster characters being killed off?</p>
<p>You can check out Heihachi's&nbsp;<em>Tekken 8&nbsp;</em>trailer right here. It doesn't give anything away regarding his fighting style; we'll have to wait for his character trailer for that.</p>

<p><em>Tekken 8&nbsp;</em>is, as you might already have guessed, the eighth mainline installment in the&nbsp;<em>Tekken&nbsp;</em>fighting series.</p>
<p>Its roster features heavyweights like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/tekken-8-paul-phoenix-gameplay-trailer-brings-back-fan-favorite">Paul Phoenix</a>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/tekken-8-reveals-nina-williams-gameplay-and-in-depth-mechanics-explanation">Nina Williams</a>, and King, as well as new faces like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/tekken-8-victor-chevalier-reveal">Victor Chevalier</a> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/tekken-8-reveals-new-character-reina">Reina</a>, many of whom appear across an epic story mode that focuses on the conflict between <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/tekken-8-kazuya-gameplay-trailer-shows-bone-crunching-combos">Kazuya Mishima</a> and his son <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/new-tekken-8-gameplay-trailer-reveals-jin-kazama-in-action">Jin Kazama</a>.</p>
<p>You can pick up&nbsp;<em>Tekken 8&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1778820/TEKKEN_8/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/tekken-8/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/tekken-8/9PPSM14VKCLW" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>.

            <title><![CDATA[Fortnite & Rocket League Adding Tesla Cybertruck This Week]]></title>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-rocket-league-adding-tesla-cybertruck-this-week/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>In a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3OKTfZS5qE" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new cinematic trailer</a> today, the official Fortnite socials confirmed that the Tesla Cybertruck will release tomorrow. </p>



<p>The trailer didn’t showcase any gameplay. However, it did offer a clear look at the Cybertruck’s official in-game look, as it tows along some heavy vehicles.</p>



<p>The new trailer clarifies that “some optional content requires purchase and/or gameplay to unlock.” It did not include the actual pricing and V-Buck value. Still, fans can likely speculate on the cost based on similar previous DLC.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Tesla Cybertruck in Fortnite Trailer" width="1200" height="675" src="about:blank" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/d3OKTfZS5qE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>







<p>With a separate <a href="https://x.com/RocketLeague/status/1815386430710874530" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">post on X</a>, the Rocket League team also confirmed that the Cybertruck would be available tomorrow. </p>



<p>This follows yesterday’s cryptic tease, but the post only reveals one image of the new addition. At this time, the devs did not offer any details about other potential themed cosmetics like custom trails.</p>



<p>The vehicle closely resembles its real-world counterpart in both games, which capture its unique design. Many fans quickly responded with humorous jabs at the Cybertruck’s reputation.</p>



<p>Rocket League just celebrated its ninth launch anniversary earlier this month. This coincided with an adidas collaboration and Festival of Football event. Season 15 also kicked off last month with the new Nissan Fairlady Z vehicle.</p>



<p>Some new Fortnite leaks also just surfaced today for Chapter 6, teasing possible <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnites-chapter-6-will-introduce-new-movement-mechanics-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new movement mechanics</a>. Fortnite is currently running its <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnites-cursed-sails-event-is-now-live/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cursed Sails event</a>, which launched sooner than expected.</p>

He explained: "They think the release is make or break, and it's not. They have a financial way to be persistent, and they never do it. It comes out, doesn't work and they throw it away.”</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/microsoft-doesnt-agree-with-ftc-comments-regarding-price-hikes/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The US Federal Trade Commission (FTC) recently <a href="https://wccftech.com/ftc-files-complaint-against-microsoft-following-game-pass-price-hike/">filed a new complaint</a> against Microsoft to the US Court of Appeals for their recent Xbox Game Pass price hike, as this is precisely what the FTC was trying to avoid with the acquisition. However, since the complaint raised by Imad Aybad has been sent forward to the US Court of Appeals, <a href="https://x.com/tomwarren/status/1814438299844382964" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Microsoft has spoken out</a> and said that they disagree with the claims made by the FTC.</p>
<p>It wasn't a surprise that Microsoft finally pulled the trigger and increased the price of the Xbox Game Pass. It was too good to be true for too long. There are many reasons as to why they could have done this, but their merger with Activision and Blizzard most likely plays a part in it. On top of that, subscriber growth to Game Pass has slowed down, meaning they need to find a way to boost revenue, with increasing the subscription price being the only reasonable solution.</p>
<p>In a letter to the court, Microsoft addressed the FTC's allegations. In the statement, Microsoft said that the FTC "presents a misleading extra-account record of the facts and is a continuation of the agency's attempts to reinvent its case on appeal."</p>
<p>Additionally, Microsoft continues to stand by the changes they are making to Game Pass and says that it is unfair to call the new version of the Standard tier a "degraded" version, as it gives the improvement of multiplayer functionality, which the previous iteration of Console Game Pass did not have. To have multiplayer functionality, subscribers must pay an extra $9.99 to utilize those features.</p>
<p>Microsoft is also trying to prove that this version of Game Pass is better than ever, as "the service will offer many new games available day-and-date, in particular Call of Duty." Call of Duty coming to Game Pass is a big deal and is one of the significant features gamers hoped for from the merger with Activision Blizzard and Microsoft. However, as recent events show, it has come at a pretty hefty price.</p>
<p>Instead of focusing on the subscription prices when Microsoft originally went to trial for the merger, Microsoft points out in the statement that "the FTC barely mentioned subscription at trial, instead focusing on the theory that Microsoft would be withholding Call of Duty from Sony's Console," which, we now know is a falsehood. Call of Duty will be available to everyone, regardless of whether they are on Xbox, PlayStation, or PC.</p>
<p>At the moment, it remains to be seen what will result from the FTC's appeal and whether it will help sway the tides in Microsoft's favor.</p>

The group, which will be represented by the Communications Workers of America (CWA),  includes artists, designers, programmers, and engineers from across the roughly 450 person studio. The news comes as Bethesda prepares to ship its <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/xbox-showcase-starfield-shattered-space-1851528944&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-showcase-starfield-shattered-space-1851528944"><em>Shattered Space </em>expansion for<em> Starfield</em></a></span><em> </em>and<em> Fallout</em> sees a major resurgence in popularity due to the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/2024-emmy-nominations-fallout-walton-goggins-shogun-1851597281&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/2024-emmy-nominations-fallout-walton-goggins-shogun-1851597281">Amazon Prime adaptation</a></span>. </p><p>Unlike recent unionization efforts at Activision Blizzard, ZeniMax, and beyond, which focused primarily on  quality assurance testers, this “wall-to-wall” union represents workers from across all of the different disciplines and departments needed to make the blockbuster hits Bethesda is famous for. In that regard, it’s similar to <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/sega-sonic-union-layoffs-persona-yakuza-1851026309&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/sega-sonic-union-layoffs-persona-yakuza-1851026309">the union at Sega of America</a></span> which represents staff from across the organization’s marketing, localization, and community management teams. </p><p>  “We are so excited to announce our union at Bethesda Game Studio and join the movement sweeping across the video game industry,” Mandi Parker, Senior System Designer at Bethesda, said in a statement. “It is clear that every worker can benefit from bringing democracy into the workplace and securing a protected voice on the job.”</p><p>The process went so quickly and smoothly due to a neutrality agreement Microsoft made with the CWA promising not to fight unionization efforts or require formal elections. Instead, employees across the company can form a union simply by showing majority support for one via a card check or visiting an online portal. The tech giant made that deal as part of an effort to get its massive $69 billion acquisition of Activision Blizzard over the finish line last year. </p><p>Unionization efforts have been slowly building in the gaming industry for years now as employees push back against cultures of extended overtime and frequent mass layoffs. That shift seems likely to gain even more momentum with major players like Bethesda joining in. Union workers there will now begin negotiating their first contract. So far, only the union at Sega of America has ratified a collective bargaining agreement at a major gaming company. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>\The release of the Nvidia GeForce RTX 50 Series may not be coming as soon as many originally thought. According to a <a href="https://x.com/kopite7kimi/status/1815314518656118837" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">new claim from a known leaker</a>, the Nvidia RTX 50 series might not be officially announced and released until CES 2025.</p>



<p>“I think we won’t see RTX 50 until CES,” they said.</p>



<p>Originally, the idea was that the Nvidia RTX 50 series would start launching this fall with the release of the RTX 5090 and RTX 5080. Based on the claim, that seems to have changed.  </p>



<p>It’s worth noting that nothing about the new GPU launch has been confirmed, so please take this latest rumor with a grain of salt. That said, the source, Kopite7Kimi, has a history of being accurate with their claims.</p>



<p>Nvidia has said that they won’t comment on rumor or speculation.</p>



<p>As far as what to expect when they do launch, the RTX 5090 is rumored to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nvidia-geforce-rtx-5090-will-have-a-2-9-ghz-base-clock-rumors-claim/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">have a base clock of 2.9 GHz</a>. Expected TDP for the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nvidia-geforce-rtx-5000-series-gpu-power-leaked-by-seasonic/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new lineup of cards were also leaked</a> via Seasonic’s PSU wattage calculator.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/its-not-cheap-to-showcase-at-geoff-keighleys-gamescom-onl.933489/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/gamescom-onl-prices<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>If you're a studio looking to showcase your game during Geoff Keighley's Gamescom Opening Night Live ceremony, then you'd better be prepared to pay for the privilege.</p>
<p>Per Gamescom's <a href="https://forms.gamescom.global/en/booking-opening-night-live/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">official booking form</a>, prices for a spot during the pre-show start at&nbsp;€57,500, which works out at around $62,500. That'll get you a 30-second trailer. As a reminder, that's for the pre-show, not the main event.</p>
<p>For 60 seconds, you'll have to pay&nbsp;€82,500 (about $90,000), with prices rising to&nbsp;€107,500 (about $117,000) and&nbsp;€132,500 (around $144,000) for 90-second and 120-second spots respectively. The pre-show airs before the livestream for the main show, and it's not shown to Gamescom's in-person audience.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/gamescom-prices-execs.jpg?itok=nUxtxWV9 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/gamescom-prices-execs.jpg?itok=sozJ_6zy 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Gamescom isn't cheap for those wanting to showcase their games during Opening Night Live.</figcaption></figure><p>Bookings for the main show are sold out now, but a <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240627122943/https://forms.gamescom.global/en/booking-opening-night-live/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">quick search through the trusty internet archive</a> reveals just how much a studio will have paid for their game to be shown during Opening Night Live, and the costs are pretty eye-watering.</p>
<p>A mere 30-second spot costs a staggering&nbsp;€115,000, with prices rising to&nbsp;€165,000,&nbsp;€215,000, and&nbsp;€265,000 for 60-second, 90-second, and 120-second spots in that order.</p>
<p>If you think that sounds expensive, then you're not wrong; prices have risen significantly for showcase hopefuls since 2022. According <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pcgamer.com/heres-how-much-it-costs-to-show-a-game-in-gamescom-opening-night-live/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">to PC Gamer</a>, a one-minute trailer during 2022's Gamescom Opening Night Live would have cost&nbsp;€125,000, which is&nbsp;€40,000 less than this year's price.</p>
<p>A 90-second spot would have set a studio back&nbsp;€165,000 in 2022, as compared to the&nbsp;€215,000 the same studio would pay today. Hey, at least they didn't hike the prices when the main show slots sold out, right?</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/gamescom-capcom-monster-hunter-wilds.jpg?itok=EkYF5HHu 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/gamescom-capcom-monster-hunter-wilds.jpg?itok=KkvF4nrs 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Capcom is just one of this year's exhibitors at Gamescom.</figcaption></figure><p>It's worth noting that there are some games that are essentially editorially chosen, and that those games "earn" themselves a spot during Opening Night Live without having to pay for the privilege, so not everyone's going to be coughing up the amounts outlined above.</p>
<p>Additionally, these prices aren't for a spot on the show floor (since Gamescom is a public event at which studios have booths for interested attendees to check out); they're strictly for a trailer during Opening Night Live or its pre-show segment.</p>
<p>Still, any studio that wants to show off its game during such a high-profile presentation had better have some serious cash to pony up, it seems.</p>
<p>Gamescom Opening Night Live airs on August 20th at 2pm Eastern (that's 11am Pacific), and you'll be able to catch it via Gamescom's official <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@gamescom1230" rel="noopener" target="_blank">YouTube</a> and <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/gamescom" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Twitch</a> channels.</p>

Yes, telling you that it’s an adventure game which you navigate via a grid that moves the environment with you is technically accurate, but that doesn’t encapsulate how or why this effortless, intuitive way of moving through its world and embracing its inherent restrictions scratches an itch in my brain.</p><figure id="" data-id="8b59453cf81abad677fec59825a4cffe" data-recommend-id="image://8b59453cf81abad677fec59825a4cffe" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="448" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Jemma knocks someone off a ladder with her movement abilities." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Jemma knocks someone off a ladder with her movement abilities." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Gif<!-- -->: <!-- -->Furniture &amp; Mattress</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="8b59453cf81abad677fec59825a4cffe" data-recommend-id="image://8b59453cf81abad677fec59825a4cffe" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="448" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Jemma knocks someone off a ladder with her movement abilities." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>There were times when I was playing through <em>Arranger</em> where it didn’t feel hyperbolic to call it a “perfect” video game because Furniture &amp; Mattress so concisely delivers upon an idea without letting it overstay its welcome, repeat itself, or ever approach tedium. The team blends its clever puzzle design into the game’s themes, as well as having some genuinely charming writing along the way. At the center of all of it is the heartfelt story of Jemma, a small-town outcast who was born with the unwanted ability to shift the environment around her as she walks through it. If she moves to the left, the entire x-axis across from her moves with her. That means any person or thing that happens to be on that line will be dragged along with her steps, looping between the edges until she steps off that line and into another to start the process again.<br></p><p>Jemma, feeling like she doesn’t quite fit in in this little town, decides to leave, and uncovers hidden truths about this world and her powers that her lifelong neighbors could never fathom. <em>Arranger </em>delivers all of this with writing just as clever as its puzzle design, but even as I was invested in Jemma’s self-discovery and desire to leave the claustrophobic confines of her small town, navigating <em>Arranger</em>’s puzzle-driven world was enough hook me on its own.</p><figure id="" data-id="4d751ca9f0690aa58455be331cec4eb5" data-recommend-id="image://4d751ca9f0690aa58455be331cec4eb5" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="448" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Jemm pushes a sword into an enemy." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Jemm pushes a sword into an enemy." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Gif<!-- -->: <!-- -->Furniture &amp; Mattress</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="4d751ca9f0690aa58455be331cec4eb5" data-recommend-id="image://4d751ca9f0690aa58455be331cec4eb5" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="448" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Jemm pushes a sword into an enemy." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><em>Arranger</em>’s core conceit of Jemma moving parts of the world as she walks through it is introduced as the silliest of inconveniences. She walks through the town square and knocks down a ladder on the other side of the walkway because she can’t control her abilities. But it also proves to be her greatest asset as she navigates new, unknown places and you master her abilities. <em>Arranger</em> has combat, but it’s done by manipulating the environment to push swords into foes. Often, however, they’ll be positioned just awkwardly enough that you can’t just drive a blade through a beastie’s heart. That’s where the puzzle part of <em>Arranger</em> comes in. Pushing entire pathways along with your movement while only being able to move on the x and y axes is the perfect, instinctual limitation that <em>Arranger </em>is constantly building on.<br></p><p>Each new area Jemma arrives in has a distinct mechanic added on top of the core loop. Some are as simple as avoiding laser beams that trigger barriers in her path, while others are as complex as controlling two characters at once that aren’t on parallel paths. <em>Arranger</em> never tutorializes any of these new ideas, instead making you figure it out on your own as each new obstacle appears in your way. Still, the game is so concise in its visual communication that figuring these new obstacles out out feels almost innate, like something built into your muscle memory. And while there are ways in which you’re restricted by the game’s movement, there are ways in which you’re liberated by it, too. Figuring out I could quickly get through long pathways by looping from one side to the other was an incredibly satisfying moment in which I realized I was navigating <em>Arranger</em>’s world with the same kind of in-the-zone precision and awareness I associate with games like <em>Tetris</em>, and there are moments like that up to the very end.</p><p><em>Arranger </em>is a brisk adventure, but it’s filled with so many clever, perfectly executed ideas that by the time it was over, I was just left wanting more. Jemma’s story might be over by the end, but I’d love to see Furniture &amp; Mattress add new puzzles in future updates because the team has such an immaculate, clever eye for what makes puzzle games so satisfying. Now I’m just waiting for my memory of the game to fade so I can go back and try to solve those puzzles with fresh eyes once more.<br></p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>To celebrate the arrival of Deadpool &amp; Wolverine on July 26, Xbox unveiled a<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xbox-releases-new-controller-with-deadpools-butt/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> special edition </a>‘Cheeky’ controller that features the anti-hero’s famed butt cheeks. To add to the bromance between Deadpool and Wolverine, Xbox has unveiled a Wolverine edition of the wireless controller featuring “Logan’s very own Adamantium-tough tush”.</p>



<p>Just having Deadpool’s tush on an Xbox controller wasn’t enough, so they went on to add Wolverine’s butt cheeks too. The Wolverine edition of the Cheeky Controller features a unique design with different colours. The controller has been clad with Wolverine’s iconic comic-inspired blue and yellow costume, with yellow joysticks and black buttons. There is additional detailing on the controller, which gives it the feel of a tactical suit.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Deadpool is known for his over-the-top antics, and to celebrate the announcement of the Wolverine edition Xbox controller, a massive billboard was put up in Alberta, Canada. The poster reads, “My Best Bub’s cheeks never looked so good,” it features an image of Deadpool sitting on the Wolverine Cheeky Controller.&nbsp;</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>The Wolverine edition Xbox Cheeky controller is an exclusive item and will not be available for purchase, similar to the Deadpool edition controller. Players who wish to acquire it must enter the 18+ Xbox Sweepstakes contest. To do so, you must follow Xbox on X (formerly Twitter) and repost their Sweepstakes post embedded below. Doing this will also allow you to win 2 ‘Cheeky Controllers’, the Deadpool-inspired Xbox Series X, and a stand that features foam versions of the anti-hero’s trusty katanas, Bea and Arthur.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LUExu3qU-o">a new trailer</a>, Capcom announced that Terry Bogard of Fatal Fury will join the Street Fighter 6 roster in Autumn 2024.</p>



<p>Capcom did not confirm an exact release date. However, the new teaser does clarify that Bogard will be available in World Tour, Battle Hub, and Fighting Ground. </p>



<p>The new teaser is purely cinematic, so Terry Bogard’s kit remains unclear. But there are some hints about Bogard’s potential abilities, and fans are quickly speculating based on existing Fatal Fury content. </p>

<p>Fatal Fury is a classic series that took the fighting genre by storm in the 90’s. It’s unclear if Capcom has plans for Andy Bogard, Joe Higashi, and other central characters from the IP. They’re a natural fit, and fans widely praise Terry Bogard’s addition to the Street Fighter 6 roster. </p>



<p>Capcom also previously released a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/street-fighter-x-monster-hunter-crossover-is-coming-april-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">crossover with Monster Hunter</a>, which arrived in April 2024. However, that was a smaller event that mostly involved cosmetics.</p>



<p>Street Fighter 6 released in June 2023 to solid critic ratings, and it <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/street-fighter-6-player-count/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reached one million players</a> in just 3 days after launch. In April 2024, Capcom even <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/capcom-raises-earnings-forecast-following-dragons-dogma-2-boost/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">raised its earnings forecast</a> following the success of Street Fighter 6 and Dragon’s Dogma 2. </p>



<p>Street Fighter fans also look forward to a new movie, which recently got a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/street-fighter-movie/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">release window of 2026</a>.</p>

<p>Several new rumors have claimed that Modern Warfare 3 will be coming to Xbox Game Pass on July 24, which Insider Gaming has been able to corroborate with its sources.</p>



<p>We first reported that Modern Warfare 3 will be coming to Xbox Game Pass this month a couple of weeks ago, but at the time couldn’t verify the exact release date with multiple primary sources. However, since then, several new claims have said that Modern Warfare 3 will be released on Game Pass on July 24.</p>



<p>The date was first mentioned by XboxEra’s Sikamikanico during the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/F5yyYnZVbWw?si=Aou3EG6b5QNJEM_p&amp;t=4818" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">XboxEra podcast</a>, in which he said, “July 24th is the rumor [for a MW3 Xbox Game Pass release].” Later, leaker eXtas1s <a href="https://x.com/eXtas1stv/status/1815163683661594741" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">corroborated the date</a>, also saying July 24. Soon after, WindowsCentral’s Jez Corden also <a href="https://x.com/JezCorden/status/1815175561607618798" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">tweeted to his own report</a> from earlier this month covering our story by stating “very soon”.</p>



<p>July 24 is also the date that Insider Gaming has been hearing for the release of Modern Warfare 3 on Xbox Game Pass.</p>



<p>It’s not entirely clear on when the announcement will be made, but Xbox typically makes its Game Pass announcements on a Tuesday. So keep your eyes peeled.</p>



<p>Several claims have also said that&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xbox-game-pass-activision-august/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">older Activision games will start to come to the subscription service later this month</a>, including Crash Bandicoot N.Sane Trilogy.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/no-mans-sky-ps5-pro-upgrade-details-revealed-through-datamine/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>Dataminers have spotted mentions of a PS5 Pro upgrade for No Man’s Sky within mere days of Hello Games revealing details on their massive <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/no-mans-sky-worlds-part-1-update-revealed-with-deep-dive-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Worlds Part 1 update</a>. See below the datamined features for this upgrade and the players’ reception.</p>



<p>The details were revealed on X (formerly Twitter) by a game developer and modder named ThatBomberBoi. The No Man’s Sky datamined file contains information on a Graphics Details Preset for ‘<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/playstations-spectral-super-resolution-pssr/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Trinity</a>‘, which many might know as the internal codename for PS5 Pro.&nbsp;</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Many keen-eyed viewers have noted no radical changes to No Man’s Sky’s PS5 Pro upgrade. The increase of the lowest dynamic resolution factor for the game from 0.6 to 0.8 and the base resolution for No Man’s Sky on the PS5 Pro from 1300p to 1730p are the only ones worth noting. These changes will result in a clearer and more detailed visual experience. Other than that, some settings have been upgraded from High to Ultra, enhancing the overall visual quality of the game.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Players have expressed disappointment with the minimal upgrades for No Man’s Sky’s PS5 Pro upgrade on r/<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1e7qkjr/first_ps5_pro_trinity_graphics_settings_insight/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GamingLeaksAndRumours</a>. They had hoped for more, such as the game running at 4K on the mid-refresh, but a bump to 1730p isn’t that significant. Also, many wonder what frame rate they can expect on the PS5 Pro for No Man’s Sky.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Some players have also raised valid concerns about the files’ mention of Nvidia’s DLSS and Reflex technologies alongside Intel’s XeSS, considering PS5 Pro will run on AMD’s platform.</p>



<p>On the topic of PS5 Pro, check out the recent leak about the mid-gen refresh console’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/new-ps5-pro-gpu-details-leaked/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GPU</a>. Also, check out the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ps5-pro-enhanced-details/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">developer requirements</a> to meet the “PS5 Pro Enhanced’ label.

			<p>At TennoCon 2024 in London, Ontario, Canada, Digital Extremes showed off <a href="https://wccftech.com/warframe-1999-is-out-this-winter-will-add-romance-system/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Warframe: 1999</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/soulframe-early-access-begins-later-this-year-overworld-is-larger-than-warframes-open-zones/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Soulframe</a>, both launching within the year. Following the presentations, we were able to chat with Megan Everett (Community Director on Warframe) and Rebecca Ford (Creative Director on Warframe) to have a deep and thorough discussion about the future of the 10-year-plus free-to-play action shooter game.</p>
<p><iframe title="TennoCon 2024 | TennoLive (Full)" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Zi7FVPa5ayQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p><strong>First up, what is the next old system getting a rework?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Megan Everett:</strong> Companions Part 2, technically. We did the official launch of 2. 0 last year, and then there were things that we just couldn't get to, so we said we'll do a Part 2, so that's gonna be getting some love this year.</p>
<p><strong>Rebecca Ford:</strong> And then the other one is, it's not really a system as much as it is a core Warframe interaction, which is we're adding favoring items to the UI. So, the way you manage your arsenal favorites is going to exist.</p>
<p><strong>Megan:</strong> And then, of course, Caliban is getting a rework. I don't know if that applies to the scenario. He's a system of joy.</p>
<p><strong>Is there going to be more <a href="https://wccftech.com/corpus-proxima-the-new-railjack-warframe-update-out-on-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Railjack</a> on the horizon?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Rebecca:</strong> Yes, you can look forward to a sort of micro-infested Railjack launch with the boss fight for Infested Liches.</p>
<p><strong>Wonderful. How about old tileset reworks like you guys did with Jupiter?&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p><strong>Rebecca:</strong> You are not. We are thinking of doing a lighting rework. It was supposed to actually launch with Jade Shadows when that whole thing went down, but we ended up having to split it out because it was too close to TennoCon. We plan on doing a lighting rework more than anything, not a core asset rework because we think the lighting makes it look like a new asset.</p>
<p><strong>Absolutely. How about reworking the ice caves?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Megan</strong>: Oh, those are old school.</p>
<p><strong>Rebecca</strong>: It would probably be lighting more than anything.</p>
<p><strong>Megan</strong>: GI lighting can solve a lot of things.</p>
<p><strong>Are there any plans to bring CC back into the spotlight?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Rebecca</strong>: Yes and no. Pablo Alonso (Design Director) and I had a conversation about CC yesterday that really comes down to, okay, if we were to touch CC, what we think is long CC is pretty much the problem, like short CC is great, Ember with her fire procs, Volt with his electricity procs. Short CC is good, and long CC is bad, and I say that in a reductive way, but we do know that. We just don't know how we're gonna approach the systemic problem of it.</p>
<p><strong>Will Digital Extremes support the migration of the Fandom Wiki and set up an official one?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Megan:</strong> Oh, that's a good question. We've been having conversations about moving it, keeping it and it really just came down to the bandwidth of the team and being able to do that. It's a lot more difficult than I think one might think it is.</p>
<p>We're good where we are now, but we are having discussions about potentially moving it. The dream is to host our own, but that is obviously a much bigger conversation with our web team and everyone like that. So, we're good where we are but we are having conversations if we do feel like it.</p>
<p><strong>Rebecca:</strong> Shout out to the people who actually run the wiki. They're all volunteers. We wish we had a good answer for you if you have issues with the way it's hosted, but it's outside our control.</p>
<p><strong>Megan:</strong> But we've been talking to the volunteers as well, and like, what do you guys want? Because you guys are the ones putting in the work, we send you the assets and everything, but what is it that you guys want? So, more to come.</p>

<p><strong>As far as weapons go, some fans don't really have the best opinions of Wise Razor. They're wondering if maybe a new two handed Nikana stance might be in the process. </strong></p>
<p><strong>Rebecca:</strong> There is not a new one in the process, but on my little post-it note of things to address when we have time, I wrote about actually changing the initial attack of Wise Razor. Our animation team, that was their first two-handed Nikana animation stance. I know that there's feedback on it, so there's no reason for us not to budget time to kind of tweak Wise Razor rather than do a new one, because I know people don't like that initial responsiveness. Again, we just gotta improve. It was our first one. We will do that. It's on the list.</p>
<p><strong>With the year 1999 established, what is the current year for Warframe?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Rebecca:</strong> Oh, we'll never answer that.</p>
<p><strong>Alright! Are there any plans to add operator loadouts and a way to link them to your Warframe loadouts?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Rebecca:</strong> I think we're adding focus school swapping to the star chart-based loadout picker. But in terms of operator loadout, so like say you want to swap your amp to a loadout... Honestly, Pablo would be a better person to answer that, and I know that we haven't talked about it in a way that makes it seem like we will do it anytime soon. Sorry about that.</p>
<p><strong>Are there any plans to update the trading system in Warframe, evolving it from just the trade chat?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Megan</strong>: I don't think in that capacity. Something we are gonna talk about is updating our players on save cross-platform. We are having deep discussions about cross-platform trading, what that looks like, and how that's going to function. That's our next step in trading. No conversations right now about taking it outside of chat. We're just looking at the cross-platform functionality of it.</p>
<p><strong>Rebecca</strong>: Shout out to the third party people that make Warframe Market. We're not associated. It's a fan thing; use it at your own risk, but they do a great thing, so we support it as players.</p>
<p><strong>You mentioned that Tau is not in the plan for the foreseeable future, but are there plans to have an alternate star chart like Empyrean?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Rebecca</strong>: No, but with Warframe: 1999, we are going to give you a way to sort of choose where you want to start the game, so to speak. Like, do you want to boot up in 1999 or the Origin system? That is coming.</p>
<p><strong>Okay. A couple of questions on weapons. Folks in the community know there's the Ghoulsaw out there, but they're wondering if you can get an actual proper chainsaw.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Rebecca:</strong> So we have the Pantera, which is like a sawblade, we have the Miter, which is a blade launcher, and we have the Ghoulsaw. I mean, we are in the '90s now, so A '90s saw weapon actually goes hard, so maybe.</p>
<p><strong>Another one was: I know there are spears out there, but what about spear and shield combinations?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Rebecca:</strong> Styanax, he's the only guy. Well, Soulframe made one, so we can steal their code and tech.</p>
<p><strong>Will dedicated augment slots on frames ever be a possibility?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Rebecca: </strong>Probably not. Sorry.</p>
<p><strong>When are Warframe players getting stamina back?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Rebecca: </strong>Never. A lot of stamina. I'll never say never, but never.</p>
<p><strong>Will the Derelict Void notes ever get fissures as well?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Rebecca: </strong>We'd have to take a look at the tile. I mean, that's probably more an oversight than anything.</p>
<p><strong>Megan:</strong> When we added the Omni fissures to the tile sets that we were missing, we had a Derelict and everything.</p>
<p><strong>Rebecca: </strong>Well, I guess they have the corrupted bolts. That actually could be super cool for people.</p>
<p><strong>Megan:</strong> It might also be a reason of, like, if you're going there to crack relics, but there's some guy with a key.</p>
<p><strong>Rebecca: </strong>Yeah, it could be dope. We'll have to see. Our bad, sorry about that. We'll look into it.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/TC2024_Art-Panel_SevagothPrime_NoCredits-HD-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p><strong>Back to weapons again. Are you going to get more stances to actually change the stance of the weapons, like the Nikana Blind Justice?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Rebecca: </strong>We haven't really done a concerted internal melee stance conversation. When we did Tennokai, that was all about heavy attacks, but we really haven't done a stance system. So, status quo is pretty likely, with the exception of Wise Razor for the near future.</p>
<p><strong>Are there plans to bring back raids or some form of larger group content?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Megan:</strong> Oh, trials. Oh, what a time. We have, I think on your whiteboard, there has been an idea for trials for quite some time. But it's all about balancing what we want to do. Obviously, the story. Warframe:1999 was huge. So, it has a place, it has a time. We just gotta see when it fits in. But we do have ideas for it, and we want to bring it back. We want it to feel like what Warframe represents now and not go back to what it was. So, yeah, it's a big project.</p>
<p><strong>Rebecca: </strong>The thing we miss most about them is having to coordinate with the team. That's our white whale right now. It's a coordination-based mission.</p>
<p><strong>Looking at Warframe: 1999, you mentioned the Gemini system for some of the cosmetics. How expansive will that system be?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Megan:</strong> It will be the Gemini skins themselves. Any Protoframe that we may be doing in the future will also have the Gemini skin. They'll all be on the same level, fully voiced. Fully optional, you can customize your Protoframe and use that emote however you want to. It'll be a consistent theme as we continue to do Echoes of 1999 and beyond that.</p>
<p><strong>Rebecca: </strong>We had a lot of fun coming up with them because we knew when the Protoframes came together, we wanted them to be a new tier of skin. But what we ended up doing is just super rewarding for people who really want two fashion frames in one mission, which is also optional, so, yeah.</p>
<p><strong>With Warframe: 1999, will Arthur be the only playable character for that?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Rebecca: </strong>Actually, yes, and only for the mission you saw. You, as a player, take over after that point. I want players to really try and analyze that last frame of the demo when Arthur is versus Excalibur. Perhaps imagine that at that point, the camera perspective shifts for the rest of 1999.</p>
<p><strong>One thing I wanted to ask about <a href="https://wccftech.com/soulframe-early-access-begins-later-this-year-overworld-is-larger-than-warframes-open-zones/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Soulframe</a> is how will the development team balance both projects?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Rebecca: </strong>The same way a circus clown balances a hundred plates, and that's just figuring out who needs what, when, and what the team and the community need and what they expect. We're figuring it out still.</p>
<p><strong>Megan</strong>: Yeah, it's definitely a day-by-day, you know, long-term planning, short-term planning, what do we want to do, but also, even though we have a dedicated Soulframe team, they also help out with Warframe. We share some tech and stuff, so it's really an all-group effort, and we want to see, obviously, Soulframe get off the ground as much as anyone else does. Their development is, I think, very similar to Warframe, right? They don't want to put it out there, and it'd be unbaked, so to speak.</p>
<p><strong>Are there plans for a unified account system where your Platinum can be used for both titles?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Rebecca: </strong>Oh my gosh. Honestly, I don't know. I have asked a million times what we're going to do. We want to do the right thing, and we don't know what that is yet. Sometimes, it takes time to come to the right decision.</p>
<p><strong> Can you talk a little bit more about your Umbra Warframes?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Rebecca: </strong>I can. For the foreseeable future, there's only one Umbra, and that's Excalibur. There's an Umbra series of content that came with The Sacrifice, and I don't see us going back to it.</p>
<p><strong>Would you ever consider reducing build times on your items, like your Forma or your Fieldron</strong></p>
<p><strong>Rebecca: </strong>We would consider it, but we've talked about it before in a way that basically says we have to do some serious validation of any plan because, as we've been transparent with the community, Forma kind of keeps the Warframe boat going, like it is our fossil fuel, so we need it as much as it needs to be used as a Build Modifier, but also for us, it's one of our more reliable microtransactions for how we run our game. In the absence of Gacha and RNG packs, you have Forma.</p>
<p><strong>Will Warframe expand into transmedia, such as a card game, tabletop, or anime?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Rebecca: </strong>We do have an animated short coming. We're collaborating with THE LINE, and they are awesome. You'll see the full thing with the 1999 launch. We do have our eye on a couple of other things. We are hoping to do a webcomic again, and if we're lucky, we'll see what happens next year.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/1999_ExcaliburVSArthur_Keyart-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p><strong>Very cool. Will there be more Lotus story on the horizon?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Rebecca: </strong>There will. Look forward to the Lotus Eaters.</p>
<p><strong>Wonderful. Are there plans for more change-of-plan scenarios? For example, if you fail to defend the last target at mobile defense, the scenario changes.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Rebecca: </strong>I actually think it's cool. And if we could do more of it, I feel like 1999 is the place to talk to Pablo about it though, but I actually super dig it. One thing we are going to do with 1999, which we'll probably have to talk about on a future dev stream, is like an endless style variant, which kind of is just a whole bunch of change of plans. Hopefully, you can look forward to that.</p>
<p><strong>How many of the arcade games in Warframe: 1999 will be playable?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Rebecca: </strong>Definitely one. There is a huge one that's its own fully ready-to-go minigame. It's Calibur Chicks. It's our Contra-esque game. But we're hoping to get at least two. The second one is currently being worked on by one of our awesome devs.</p>
<p><strong>With Lotus Eaters, is there one specific mechanic or new feature you are most excited about?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Megan</strong>: For Lotus Eaters, that one's not really our quality of life update. That's more of the unannounced full one. Sevagoth Prime does come, but yeah. It's really more about setting the scene for 1999 and kind of do a little bit more of explaining. So, that's kind of what Lotus Eaters is, but then our unannounced one will have the quality-of-life stuff in it.</p>
<p><strong>Rebecca: </strong>I'm excited for Caliban. Unannounced update: you're gonna be the best!</p>
<p><strong>I will finish off for the players who are excited about Warframe 1999 but may not have returned in a couple of years. How far will they have to progress in order to access that content?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Megan</strong>: That's a great question. It continues off of Whispers in the Walls and then Lotus Eaters Quest, so you will have to have completely caught up with the story. But lately, and really recently this year, we've been trying to streamline that process. If you are a new player and you see this 1999 demo, and you're like, I want to play that when it comes out.</p>
<p>We've really tried to make it so the game would tell you exactly the path to get there instead of, you know, yes, there's 20 different quests you can do, but there's only four required ones I need to do to get there.</p>
<p>We're trying to make those junction changes, star chart changes to really help those players get to where they want to be, because we understand that when we put out this awesome update demo and all this, you know, marketing people want to play it. We get it and we want to get them there.</p>
<p>We don't want people to be confused. That's a huge thing. We experimented with Duviri being at the beginning of the game and it didn't pan out for us, so we changed gears on that. We want to make sure that they understand the story and are caught up, but we're doing our best to get them there in the quickest way possible.</p>
<p><strong>Rebecca: </strong>We need to do our Tenno training tool to get people through the Tenno tool tips. We do have a campaign in our game, and some people still don't know that. Our goal would be to get the campaign awareness to a point where people just continue playing it instead of being interrupted by a lack of information.</p>
<p><strong>The very last one: are there plans for a native Mac client for Warframe?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Rebecca: </strong>Well, when <a href="https://wccftech.com/warframe-finally-makes-its-way-into-ios-release-expected-by-20th-februrary/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">we launched on the iOS platform</a>, we were like, oh, we're now kind of in the Apple ecosystem. And I think it kind of can work. We just don't know if we're going to focus on it before we launch and sort of perfect the issues with the iOS we have right now. So it's kind of like iOS, fix, fix, fix, fix, fix, and then we'll see about Android. I think it runs on the M1 processor and stuff because of the depth of the environment. So, we'll see.</p>
<p><strong>Well, thank you two very much for your time.&nbsp;</strong></p>

                <p>TennoCon, Digital Extremes' yearly convention, partners and donates towards charities in Canada. For TennoCon 2024, the Warframe developer chose two charities to partner with, unlike previous years where a single charity would be their choice for the community event. This year, AbleGamers is Digital Extremes' overseas choice and SickKids is its local charity choice. Digital Extremes is donating $100,000 CAD to each. Additionally, outside of these two charity donations, Digital Extremes also involved itself with Make-A-Wish this year.</p><p>With Make-A-Wish, Digital Extremes has granted a child's wish to become a video game voice actor. James, a 16-year-old with Spina Bifida, is familiar with Warframe due to his older brother being a Tenno--the affectionate name designated to the players of Warframe. Kevin Lim, a voice actor for the Warframe character Bombastine, was how Digital Extremes initially discovered James' wish.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Warframe 1999 Tennocon 2024 Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>"Through being involved with [Make-A-Wish, Lim] got wind of a boy named James–whose wish was to be a voice in a video game," community manager Megan Everett said. From there, Lim asked James, if he would be interested in being a voice actor for Warframe due to Lim's recent work on the game's Duviri Paradox expansion.</p><p>"Then Kevin Lim reached out to us and from there, we reached out to Make-A-Wish and asked if James wanted to be in Warframe. He was very excited in doing this opportunity. We just continued the conversation with James, Make-A-Wish, and his family. Corey [Van Den Hoogenband] and Veronica [Botnick] on our community team [who] have led the force for reaching out to charities over the years regardless of TennoCon. They were also very heavily involved with Make-A-Wish, and even [talked] with the developers to get his character for his arcade cabinet in-game made and aligning [James and his family] to come to London," Everett explained.</p><p>James, alongside his family, arrived in London earlier this week for James' role in the upcoming Warframe 1999 expansion, recording lines at Digital Extremes' studio. "Talking with James and his family, every day [his mother] has sent me a message that he had the best day ever during rehearsals," Kevin Lim said. Lim added that, if the online rehearsals have been the best day ever, then TennoLive will be even greater.</p><p>James and his character will appear in the arcade-cabinet section of Warframe 1999, so players can hear and watch on their own while playing the game. Warframe 1999's expansion releases this winter.</p><p>Be sure to check out our piece on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/warframe-turns-to-metal-gear-solid-for-inspiration-with-its-new-expansion-1999/1100-6517391/" data-ref-id="1100-6517391">Metal Gear Solid being Warframe 1999's inspiration</a> and our piece on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/soulframe-is-heavily-inspired-by-princess-mononoke-studio-ghibli-and-ico/1100-6517404/" data-ref-id="1100-6517404">Studio Ghibli being Soulframe's influence</a>.</p>

		<p>Capcom shared a little teaser trailer for Terry Bogart’s return to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/06/07/street-fighter-6-year-2-characters-have-been-announced/">Street Fighter 6 during year 2</a>, the Fatal Fury and King of Fighters character set to release in autumn 2024.</p>
<p><iframe title="Street Fighter 6 - Terry Teaser Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9LUExu3qU-o?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Obviously best known as a star of his own fighting game series, SNK has been a willing partner to bring Terry Bogard to other fighting games in the past. There was, of course, the Capcom vs. SNK series as a whole, but he’s also been in Fighting EX Layer and Super Smash Bros. Ultimate. Now he’s popping up in Street Fighter 6.</p>
<p>As he joins the Street Fighter roster, Terry will be available throughout the game, in the World Tour, Battle Hub and Fighting Ground mode. Capcom has done a great job of highlighting each new character with special in-game events, and there’s sure to be a bevy of in-game cosmetics to earn themed around Terry.</p>
<p>Terry will be available to be purchased individually with Fighter Coins, but will be unlocked automatically for owners of the Year 2 Character Pass or the Ultimate Pass.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/05/30/street-fighter-6-review/">In our Street Fighter 6 Review,</a> Nick said, “Street Fighter 6 doesn’t need recommending to hardcore fighting fans – you all already know how incredible it is – but do I recommend it for more casual players? Street Fighter 6 has a real sense of community, welcoming all players old and new, teaching new tricks and providing something for those that just want a bit of fun. This is truly a fighting game for everyone.”</p>

            <p>
Stardew Valley creator Eric "ConcernedApe" Barone has said he'll "never" charge money for a DLC or update "for as long as I live".
</p>
<p>
Earlier today, the developer posted on social media site X to say console and mobile ports of the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stardew-valleys-16-update-is-finally-here-with-some-impressively-lengthy-patch-notes">Stardew Valley 1.6 update</a> are "still in progress", following the PC release back in March.

</p>
<p>
"The ports and next PC update are still in progress," said Barone. "I know it is taking a long time, it's on my mind every minute. I have personally been working on the mobile port every day. I will announce when there is any meaningful news (eg. a release date). Hope you're having a good summer."

<p>

A fan followed up this post to say people won't complain about the wait "as long as everything you add is completely free".
</p>
<p>
"I swear on the honour of my family name, I will never charge money for a DLC or update for as long as I live," replied Barone. "Screencap this and shame me if I ever violate this oath."

<p>
Farming life-sim Stardew Valley was released in 2016 and has received plenty of updates ever since, but none of these have cost money.
</p>
<p>
The 1.6 update added a tonne of new content, including new festivals, items and crafting recipes, dialogue, a new farm type, and plenty more. It was well-received by fans and was followed up by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stardew-valleys-next-patch-is-here-heres-whats-new">more patches of content</a>.

</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stardew-valley-will-soon-let-players-drink-mayonnaise">Players can also now drink mayonnaise</a>, should they really desire to.

</p>
<p>
What's more, Barone's comment didn't relate specifically to Stardew Valley, meaning his sentiment could also apply to his next game, Haunted Chocolatier.
</p>
<p>
There's no release date for that yet, though <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stardew-creator-wont-rush-haunted-chocolatier-better-to-have-a-good-delayed-game-than-a-bad-game-on-time">Barone said he's "not too concerned with the pressure"</a> and that it's "better to have a delayed game that's actually good than a bad game that's on time".

<p>HYPEX, the reliable source for early Fortnite information, has shared some compelling news for Chapter 6. Players can look forward to some exciting new movement mechanics in the game. The first, ‘prone’, has been a highly requested addition to Fortnite’s gameplay for a long time, promising a fresh tactical dimension to battles.</p>



<p>The other movement mechanic for Fortnite Chapter 6 is Swinging. We’ve had a taste of Swinging in the game, thanks to the Spider-Man mythic and other rope-based traversal items in the past. However, the nature of the swinging we’ll experience in the next Chapter remains shrouded in mystery. Will it be swinging from ropes like Tarzan or off bars like parkour?</p>

            <p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/netflix">Netflix</a> currently has over 80 games in development, with plans to release a game a month to its subscribers from this month onwards.
</p>
<p>
In its <a href="https://s22.q4cdn.com/959853165/files/doc_events/2024/Jul/18/netflix-inc-usa-244e80f7-c939-40a1-a316-82d7d29f8a40.pdf">latest earnings call</a>, Netflix's co-CEO, president and director Gregory K Peters discussed the company's plans for gaming and how it will achieve growth.

</p>
<p>
Where the company is moving quickest is with interactive narrative games, which Peters describes as "easier to build". These are placed in the Netflix Stories narrative hub and it's here the company will be launching a new game each month based on popular series like Emily in Paris and Selling Sunset.

<p>

Peters promised Netflix has "lots more, including very different types of games yet to come in the quarters and years ahead".
</p>
<p>
Netflix's fellow co-CEO, president and director Theodore A Sarandos also contributed to the gaming discussion. "I think our opportunity here to serve super fandom with games is really fun and remarkable," he said. "I think the idea of being able to take a show and give the superfan a place to be in between seasons and even beyond that, to be able to use the game platform to introduce new characters and new storylines or new plot twist events, now you could do those kind of things and then they can then materialise in the next season or in the sequel to the film."
</p>
<p>
So far, Netflix has launched over one hundred games, though many of these are small in scope.
</p>
<p>
The Netflix mobile app includes a number of third-party games as part of the subscription, like Grand Theft Auto, Football Manager, and Sonic Mania, as well as original Interactive Stories based on Netflix shows like Love is Blind and Perfect Match.
</p>
<p>
Peters noted that, while Netflix had set itself "pretty aggressive engagement growth targets", which it's met, the impact on the overall business is "still quite small" - as is investment.
</p>
<p>
Now, then, "the job is to continue to grow that engagement to the place where it has a material impact on the business," he said.
</p>
<p>
At the end of last year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/netflix-developing-over-10-games-in-house-currently">Netflix head of gaming Mike Verdu revealed the company had over 10 games in development</a> at in-house studios, plus 90 games planned through deals with external teams.

</p>
<p>
It's unclear what the exact split is between in-house and third-party games for the 80 now in development, or what's changed since last year.
