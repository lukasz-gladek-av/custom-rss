It isn't the first officially licensed Lego board game, but it is the only one still in print at the moment. Older Lego board games tend to sell for rather high prices, so it'd be wise to add Monkey Palace to your collection sooner rather than later.</p>                      </div><p>What happens when a monkey stumbles upon an ancient palace in the jungle but decides to redecorate their new home? The entire place collapses, of course, so now you and up to three other players need to rebuild the structure from scratch.</p><p>To help the monkey live large again, humans take turns adding Lego pieces to makeshift staircases. Each piece is worth a certain number of Monkey Credits, which are exchanged for Monkey Cards. The Monkey Card you choose to play determines which brick type(s) you use to make and decorate the staircases. As you build, you rack up Banana Points, which are counted at the end of the game to determine the winner. Games last roughly 45 minutes.</p><p>Monkey Palace comes with 231 bricks and multiple game boards, each of which presents their own unique challenges and adds replay value. There are many different ways to build your palace, so while there are rules to follow, it is a fairly open-ended game that each player will approach from a different angle.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4423438-monkeypalace.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4423438" data-ratio="0.72" data-width="1000" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4423438-monkeypalace.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4423438"></a><figcaption>Monkey Palace: A Lego Board Game</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4423438-monkeypalace.jpg"></figure><p>Lego enthusiasts have no shortage of new building sets to choose from this month, as the brick-building giant released over 100 playsets and display models on January 1.

            <p>
Steam Deck too dinky for you? Always wished you could purchase a handheld gaming PC capable of obscuring your entire head? Then Acer might just have the answer. The company has unveiled its new Nitro Blaze 11, sporting a 10.95-inch screen and chunky form factor testing the limits of what might reasonably be considered a 'portable' gaming device.
</p>
<p>
Acer's <a href="https://www.acer.com/gb-en/handheld-gaming/nitro-handheld-gaming/nitro-blaze-11">Nitro Blaze 11</a> is, it's fair to say, a bit of a beast, measuring 36.4 cm x 17.1 cm x 1.59 cm and weighing in at 1050g - roughly the equivalent of 1.5 Steam Decks. It's unclear if those figures include the machine's two chunky detachable controllers - Acer's press release is vague on that point - but it's certainly not what you'd call an understated device. Judging by the promo images, it could comfortably be used to serve nibbles between gaming sessions too.
</p>
<p>
On the positive side, its hefty frame boasts some decent innards. That 10.95-inch screen, for instance, is a 120 Hz WQXGA 2560 x 1600 touch display capable of up to 500 nits of brightness, and it also packs in an AMD Ryzen 8040HS processor, 16GB of LPDDR5X RAM, and up to 2TB of NVMe SSD storage. That's on top of a built-in kickstand and those aforementioned detachable controllers, which now feature back buttons. And if that appeals, you'll be looking at a minimum price tag of $1099.99, depending on your storage requirements.

<p>
But if you're in the market for something a little more 
discreet - and a little cheaper - there's also Acer's new <a href="https://www.acer.com/gb-en/handheld-gaming/nitro-handheld-gaming/nitro-blaze-8">Nitro Blaze 8</a>, which features an 144 Hz 8.8-inch screen and weighs in at a more modest 720g. This one measures 30.5 cm x 13.4 cm x 2.2 cm (controllers are definitely included here, seeing as they're not detachable) and costs $899.99. Both machines include three months of Xbox Game Pass and are scheduled to launch in Q2 this year.
</p><p>
Acer's expanded Nitro Blaze line-up won't make use of AMDs newly announced trio of next-gen Ryzen Z-series APUs - designed for handheld gaming PCs - but Digital Foundry has a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2024-amd-announces-next-gen-ryzen-z2-apus-for-gaming-handhelds">little more to say about those</a> elsewhere on Eurogamer if you're curious.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/acer-nitro-blaze-11-screen-too-big-steam-deck<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The Consumer Electronics Show is taking place this week in Las Vegas, and you know what that means: impractical tech announcements out the wazoo (and, like, three things that are actually cool). Among the former is <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/6/24335423/acer-handheld-gaming-pc-nitro-blaze-8-11-specs-price" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Acer’s new Nitro Blaze 11 gaming handheld</a>, which has a 10.95-inch screen. I love a gleaming, glorious window into the digital realm as much as the next guy, but I’m sorry: That’s too big.&nbsp;</p><p>I submit just one piece of evidence: the above picture. That should be enough, because look at it! My man is studying <em>Balatro </em>hands on a device five times the size of his own. He’s attempting a <em>Hades II</em> run while explaining to a child that the whole world is “thiiiiiiiiiiiis big.” He’s playing the <em>Tony Hawk</em> remasters on a surface he could attach wheels to and use as a skateboard.</p><p>This is a handheld only in the technical sense; it does indeed require hands to hold, but probably many more than you or I actually possess. Like any member of our exceedingly exhausted species, I enjoy playing my Steam Deck while lying down in bed. Due to the width of that device, however, my wrists, elbows, and shoulders tend to tap out after an hour or so. Imagine trying to use the Nitro Blaze 11 in that scenario. You’d succumb to cramps you didn’t even know your body could produce in seconds. </p><p>At the very least, the Nitro Blaze 11 includes a built-in kickstand and detachable controllers, but that merely gestures at the problem. It does not solve it. If you're mainly planning to perch this thing atop another surface and play it from a couch or a chair, you do not want a handheld; you're looking for a console or gaming PC, both of which you likely already have if you're the kind of person who'd considering buying a device like this for the low, low price of $1,099.99.</p><p>I’m guessing that Acer – which also announced the 8.8-inch Nitro Blaze 8 – is testing the limits here or engaging in a full-on marketing stunt, the kind which companies lean on during CES to stand out among a crowded convention hall. Either way, take it from me, somebody who plays almost everything on handhelds despite owning a pretty decent gaming PC: too big.&nbsp;</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><a target="" rel="" tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/open-thread-how-was-your-break"><h3>Open Thread: How Was Your Break?</h3></a><p>I did not turn off motion smoothing at my parents' house</p></div><a target="" rel="" tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

          <p>Nearly two years ago, AMD announced <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/04/amds-ryzen-z1-chips-could-power-a-new-wave-of-handheld-steam-deck-clones/">its first Ryzen Z1 processors</a>. These were essentially the same silicon that AMD was putting in high-end thin-and-light laptops but tuned specifically for handheld gaming PCs like the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/11/review-steam-deck-oleds-brilliant-screen-fixes-the-portables-biggest-flaw/">Steam Deck</a> and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/08/asus-rog-ally-x-review-better-performance-and-feel-in-a-pricey-package/">Asus ROG Ally X</a>. As part of its CES announcements today, AMD is refreshing that lineup with three processors, all slated for an undisclosed date in the first quarter of 2025.</p>
<p>Although they're all part of the "Ryzen Z2" family, each of these three chips is actually much different under the hood, and some of them are newer than others.</p>
<p>The Ryzen Z2 Extreme is what you'd expect from a refresh: a straightforward upgrade to both the CPU and GPU architectures of the Ryzen Z1 Extreme. Based on the same "Strix Point" architecture as the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/08/ryzen-ai-300-performance-review-impressive-cpus-even-if-you-dont-care-about-ai/">Ryzen AI 300 laptop processors</a>, the Z2 Extreme includes eight CPU cores (three high-performance Zen 5 cores, five smaller and efficiency-optimized Zen 5C cores) and an unnamed RDNA 3.5 GPU with 16 of AMD's compute units (CUs). These should both provide small bumps to CPU and GPU performance relative to the Ryzen Z1 Extreme, which used eight Zen 4 CPU cores and 12 RDNA 3 GPU cores.</p>

<p>The Ryzen Z2, on the other hand, appears to be exactly the same chip as the Ryzen Z1 Extreme, but with a different name. Like the Z1 Extreme, it has eight Zen 4 cores with a 5.1 GHz maximum clock speed and an RDNA 3 GPU with 12 cores.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/paizo-announces-pathfinder-lost-omens-shining-kingdoms-and-treasure-vault-remastered<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Paizo is bringing two new sourcebooks to <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/games/pathfinder" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Pathfinder Second Edition</em></a>. The largest fantasy TTRPG competitor to <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/dungeons-dragons" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em></a> has two books arriving in the first half of 2025. One is a remaster of an older book. The second is a supplement: <em>Pathfinder Lost Omens Shining Kingdoms</em>.</p>

<h2>The <em>Pathfinder Lost Omens Shining Kingdoms</em> Announcement</h2>

<p>According to the <a href="https://paizo.com/products/btq08pw5/discuss?Pathfinder-Lost-Omens-Shining-Kingdoms#tabs" rel="nofollow">official store page</a>, <em>Pathfinder Lost Omens Shining Kingdoms</em> will focus on six key nations of the Inner Sea. The aptly named Shining Kingdoms are lands full of knightly orders, proud ancient cultures, and deadly court intrigue.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pathfinder-andoran-artwork.jpg?itok=IjOv9aKp 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pathfinder-andoran-artwork.jpg?itok=K170xqoC 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>This new supplement for <em>Pathfinder Second Edition</em> will delve into these six nations.</p>

<p>Andoran is the bastion of democratic freedom. Druma is the kingdom's trade hub. The Five Kings Mountains are the home of the fractured dwarven kingdoms. Galt is the land perpetually wracked with violent revolutions. Kyonin is the homeland of the elves cloaked in illusion. Last is Taldor, the ossified remnants of one of the Inner Sea's greatest empires.</p>

<p>Each region in <em>Pathfinder Lost Omens Shining Kingdoms</em> will present new player options. These include new archetypes, equipment, magic items, spells, and animal companions. Players can also learn more about each region's factions such as Andoran's Eagle Knights or the Shieldwrought Striders of the Five Kings Mountains.</p>

<p>For DMs, the supplement will include a bestiary of monsters and a fold-out poster map to serve as a centerpiece for a Shining Kingdoms campaign.</p>

As the name implies, this is a reprinting of the Treasure Vault supplement with its terms and gameplay revised to align with <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/pathfinder-remaster-previewed-by-paizo-inc" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Pathfinder Second Edition Remastered</a>. If you already own the original version, it will remain compatible with this new version of the game. However, if you want the most up to date version, the option is here.</p>

<p>Both <em>Pathfinder Lost Omens Shining Kingdoms</em> and P<em>athfinder Treasure Vault Remastered</em> will release in June 2025. Shining Kingdoms is available at an MSRP of $59.99. Treasure Vault Remastered is available at an MSRP of $64.99.</p>

		<p>Microsoft has announced a partnership with LG to bring Xbox Cloud Gaming to LG’s new Smart TVs, and Xbox Game Pass Ultimate members will be able to use it. Those who have this membership will be able to access Xbox Game Pass games through the Xbox app on LG TVs, and will not need an Xbox console. It is all part of Microsoft’s This Is an Xbox plan, which is the company’s push to show how many devices Xbox games can be played on.</p>
<p><iframe title="Xbox - This Is an Xbox" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/IYBSNQLsBKk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>As part of the partnership, Game Pass Ultimate players will also be able to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/11/20/xbox-cloud-gaming-now-lets-you-stream-some-of-your-own-games/">stream their own games</a> that they own, as long as they are part of the initial 50 launch titles for the service. This service is already available on other devices. In its announcement post, Microsoft said, <em>“Today, we’re excited to announce our collaboration with LG Electronics to bring the Xbox app to their new LG Smart TVs later this year. This means Game Pass Ultimate members will be able to play their games directly from the Xbox app on supported LG Smart TVs via Xbox Cloud Gaming. This gives players even more choice in how they enjoy their favorite games. Soon, players with LG Smart TVs will be able to explore the Gaming Portal for direct access to hundreds of games in the Game Pass Ultimate catalog, including popular titles such as&nbsp;Call of Duty: Black Ops 6, and upcoming releases like&nbsp;Avowed&nbsp;(launching February 18, 2025).”</em></p>

                <p dir="ltr">Nintendo Switch users are reporting that some recently purchased Switch games have arrived with the game cartridge missing from inside the box. Even odder, the cartridges appear to have been swapped out for… googly eyes.</p><p dir="ltr">Over the holidays, posts about the bizarre phenomenon began <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/1hnl1c4/didnt_see_this_coming/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" rel="nofollow ">popping up on social media</a>. Multiple players have shared photos of freshly unwrapped Switch game cases holding a lone googly eye in the spot where the game itself should be.</p><p dir="ltr">"The Grinch got us this year," reads one Reddit post featuring a photo of a Super Mario Party Jamboree case with a lone googly eye in the space meant for the game cartridge.</p><p dir="ltr">It's not clear how widespread the issue is, nor is it clear who the culprit is. Some <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch/comments/1hllexj/comment/m3n7lga/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" rel="nofollow ">players suspect that warehouse workers</a> somewhere along the supply chain are snatching the cartridges (likely with the intent to resell them) and replacing them with a googly eye so the weight of the missing cartridge goes unnoticed, or for the purpose of making sure the box sounds like it still has a game inside it when shaken.</p><p dir="ltr">Though the exact source of the missing game cartridges remains unknown, multiple comments and posts mention purchasing a Switch game from Walmart and finding nothing but a googly eye inside, suggesting one of the retail giant's warehouses may be the source of the problem.</p><p dir="ltr">One Reddit user says they've fallen victim to the googly eye switcheroo multiple times.</p><p dir="ltr">"Bought Tears of the Kingdom at a Walmart in Arizona, and this happened to me," they wrote. "Walmart refused to refund/replace, blaming Nintendo. Had to twist their arms a bit, but Nintendo eventually gave me a digital copy of the game. Recently, I went to Walmart to buy Pokémon Violet. I asked if the clerk would watch me open it because I told them about what happened with TotK. Bro was beside himself when I cracked it open to reveal yet another googly eye. They swapped out the game for another (which we also checked)."</p><p dir="ltr">Neither Walmart nor Nintendo have commented on the issue. For now, an issue at Walmart warehouses or distribution centers seems to be the likeliest culprit. But it's also possible that Santa simply ran out of coal this year.</p>

However, in <em>Marvel Rivals</em>, the strongest shield has less than half the hit points of <em>Overwatch</em>’s original Reinhardt shield (2,000 compared to 800). These Tanks focus more on diving in and disrupting the enemy.

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/cs2-adds-train-to-map-pool/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/counter-strike-2-adds-train-to-map-pool-ahead-of-next-major.1075299/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/cs2-adds-train-to-map-pool/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>For the third straight Major in a row, the most illustrious Counter-Strike 2 Major will feature a different active duty map pool. Valve announced today that the remade Train will replace Vertigo in time for the BLAST.tv Austin Major in April 2025.</p>



<p>With the next CS2 Major using this map pool, many are now expecting the in-game Premier pool and other official tournaments to swap in Train in place of Vertigo.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-end-of-the-line-for-vertigo">End of The Line for Vertigo</h2>



<p>Train officially returned to Counter-Strike, debuting for the first time in CS2, back in November 2024. The reworked map has been subjected to a complete visual overhaul (including a gorgeous rain effect when outdoors) and several major gameplay changes. Notably, both bombsites are now more open with less train car clutter, the Heaven area looking down on the A site is gone, and the “Popdog” ladder has been expanded to a long spiral staircase. The CS2 community as a whole has <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-cs2-maps/">eager</a><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-cs2-maps/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">l</a><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-cs2-maps/">y been waiting</a> for Train to come to CS2 for some time.</p>



<p>While Train’s arrival to the Active Duty map pool was inevitable, Valve has finally confirmed which map it will replace: Vertigo. At the professional level, outside of a couple of top North American teams, Vertigo has been one of the least played maps. According to statistics <a href="https://www.hltv.org/stats/maps?startDate=2024-01-01&amp;endDate=2024-12-31&amp;matchType=BigEvents" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">from HLTV</a>, it is the least played map at big events in 2024 other than Overpass, which was removed from the map pool during the year.</p>



<p>The only thing that remains unclear is when Train will officially be implemented in the in-game and other tournament map pools. The 2025 calendar for CS2 is set to officially begin just as week from now with BLAST Spring Bounty 2025. With the changes to the CS2 ecosystem, all big events will affect the global standings that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/valve-confirms-cs2-major-expansion-and-rankings-based-invitations/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">determine who is invited to the Major or its closed qualifiers</a>.</p>



<p>Is replacing Vertigo with Train the right move? Join the discussion in the official&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums</a>.</p>

<p>AMD’s next generation of graphics cards are here as the company has officially unveiled its first RDNA 4 graphics cards, the Radeon RX 9000 series. The announcement came during the company’s press event at CES 2025.</p>



<p>The two new cards announced on Monday were the AMD Radeon RX 9070 XT and Radeon RX 9070. </p>



<p>While the cards have been unveiled along with various partners, not much in terms of specs, specific release date, or pricing were revealed. AMD said that more information on RDNA 4 and the new cards will be announced later this quarter. </p>



<p>What was mentioned was that they would be available at some point during Q1 and feature the next-gen FidelityFX Super Resolution 4 (FSR 4). AMD says that the the cards feature a 4nm process, 2nd generation AI accelerators, and 3rd generation ray tracing accelerators. FSR 4 was also developed specifically for RDNA 4 cards, suggesting that older cards won’t have access to the feature.  That wasn’t confirmed, however.</p>



<p>The new cards, when released, will be available from AMD along with a number of partners such as Asrock, Gigabyte, Sapphire, ASUS, and more. In addition to the RX 9070 XT and RX 9070, AMD will be releasing RX 9060 series graphics cards as well. Information on those cards will also be coming at a later date.</p>

Microsoft's push to deliver Xbox gaming without requiring users to purchase Xbox hardware is set to continue in 2025, with Xbox Cloud Gaming support officially coming to LG TVs.
</p>
<p>
Starting "later this year", LG TV owners will be able to download the Xbox app and play "hundreds" of titles from the Game Pass Ultimate catalogue via cloud streaming, including Obsidian Entertainment's upcoming Avowed (which launches in February) and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-is-eurogamers-game-of-2024">Eurogamer's Game of the Year 2024</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://eurogamer.net/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-review">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a>. 
</p>
<p>
Microsoft notes the Xbox app on LG TVs will also support the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-game-pass-ultimate-subscribers-can-now-stream-select-games-from-their-own-library-via-cloud-gaming">recently introduced</a> ability for users to stream "select" Xbox games they already own - from the current list of "over 50" titles - even if they're not presently available as part of Game Pass.

<p>
In all cases, an Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscription is required (starting at £14.99 a month), as is a "supported" LG Smart TV. Microsoft's <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/01/06/xbox-lg-smart-tv-cloud-gaming/">initial announcement</a> doesn't detail which TVs will be compatible with the service, but it says more details will be shared in the "coming months".
</p><p>
Xbox Cloud Gaming's arrival on LG TVs follows its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-partnering-with-amazon-to-deliver-xbox-cloud-gaming-via-fire-tv-devices">launch on Amazon Fire TV devices</a> last year and on Samsung TVs in 2022. Xbox boss <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/phil-spencer">Phil Spencer</a> previously confirmed the Xbox app was Microsoft's new approach to bringing cloud gaming to the masses after it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-decides-to-pivot-away-from-xbox-game-pass-streaming-box-for-now">pulled the plug</a> on its own Xbox cloud gaming device, codenamed Keystone, back in 2022.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/xbox-app-to-come-to-select-lg-smart-tvs-ultimate-game-pass-subscribers-to-benefit/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Microsoft has been on a mission to peddle its products with the slogan of "Xbox Anywhere." This includes being able to stream or play Xbox titles on their PCs, TVs, and even phones. Today, it's been announced by Xbox that there is a partnership with LG Electronics to bring the Xbox App to specific LG Smart TVs.</p>
<p>This means that those who have an LG Smart TV will gain access to the Xbox Gaming portal, where people will then get access to the Game Pass Ultimate catalog, allowing those interested to have access to top games like Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 and the highly anticipated title, Avowed. To play the games, people will need to have an Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscription and a compatible Bluetooth wireless controller to play games through the Xbox App. Additionally, those who are Xbox Game Pass members will also have the opportunity to play their own games. At the moment, there are only 50 games this applies to, with the list of games available on the <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2024/11/20/stream-your-own-game-xbox-cloud-gaming-beta/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Xbox Wire page</a>, where you can find out all of the info regarding streaming your games.</p>
<p>"We are thrilled to announce the partnership with Xbox, which aims to enrich the gaming experience on LG Smart TVs with a broader selection of popular games. The Gaming Portal will provide users with a seamless, convenient, and exciting way to enhance the gaming experience on LG Smart TVs," says Chris Jo, the Senior Vice President of Platform Business at LG.</p>
<p>At the moment, the specific TVs haven't been specified by Xbox or LG, with the post created on Xbox Wire simply stating that the collaboration will go to their new LG Smart TVs "later this year."</p>
<p>This is all a <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/01/06/xbox-lg-smart-tv-cloud-gaming/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">relatively new venture for Xbox</a>, as the ability to stream your own game on select platforms is also a trial that they are exploring and is an attempt to bring the Xbox Cloud Gaming Experience to the forefront, as they are slowly stepping away from focusing on console releases, and are trying to look at the bigger picture. However,<a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-hardware-diminishing-returns/"> it has been confirmed by Phil Spencer</a> that they are continuing to explore new hardware and consoles that will be made in the future despite the difficulties in profit and cost.</p>
<p>Despite the troublesome time that Xbox has seemingly experienced as of late, <a href="https://wccftech.com/analyst-reckons-xbox-has-a-bright-future-according-to-sales-data/">according to Mat Piscatella</a>, Xbox is going to turn it around and will get to experience a bright future. A lot of this could boil down to the fact that they are no longer doing Xbox Exclusives, as they want to push the game onto as many platforms as possible.</p>
<p>Now it's just a waiting game to see how smooth the Xbox Cloud Gaming experience is on an LG Smart TV.</p>

The 27-inch and 32-inch 4K UltraSharp Thunderbolt displays announced at CES have been updated with new IPS panels that provide 120Hz refresh rates alongside features designed to enhance visual comfort.</p><p>The UltraSharp line is a popular choice for working professionals who need a no-frills 4K monitor that supports Windows, macOS, and multi-monitor setups — the 27-inch model in particular tops <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/wirecutter/reviews/best-4k-monitors/">a lot</a> <a href="https://www.pcmag.com/picks/the-best-4k-monitors">of</a> <a href="https://www.rtings.com/monitor/reviews/best/by-resolution/4k-ultra-hd-uhd">lists</a> for best 4K monitor. 120Hz refresh rates are usually targeted toward gamers who can benefit from higher frame rates and smoother, more responsive gameplay, which now makes the 27-inch UltraSharp 4K in particular a decent solution for people who want a single display that’s suitable for both work <em>and</em> play.</p><p>The improvements come at a cost though: the 27-inch UltraSharp 4K is increasing to $699.99 (<a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8836598/type/dlg/https://www.dell.com/en-us/shop/dell-ultrasharp-27-4k-usb-c-hub-monitor-u2723qe/apd/210-bdpf/monitors-monitor-accessories">up from $639.99 for the 60Hz model</a>), and the larger 32-inch UltraSharp 4K now costs $949.99 (<a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8836598/type/dlg/https://www.dell.com/en-us/shop/dell-ultrasharp-32-4k-usb-c-hub-monitor-u3223qe/apd/210-bdph/monitors-monitor-accessories">up from $919.99</a>). Both will be available to buy globally starting February 25th, according to Dell.</p><div><figcaption><em>Here’s a look at what the new 32-inch Dell UltraSharp 4K monitor looks like from the front.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Dell</cite></p></div><p>Dell introduced several <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/11/3/23944722/dell-ultrasharp-u2424h-u2424he-u2724d-u2724de-120hz-price-release-date-specs-features">120Hz monitors to the UltraSharp lineup in 2023</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/4/24024951/dell-ultrasharp-curved-thunderbolt-monitor-u4025qw-u3425we-price-release-date-specs-features">2024</a>, but this is the first time that the popular 27-inch 4K model has seen a similar refresh rate boost. Other improvements for the new UltraSharp 4K models include up to 140W power delivery via USB-C (up from 90W), and a 3,000:1 contrast ratio, thanks to its use of “enhanced IPS Black technology” that provides 47 percent deeper blacks compared to conventional IPS panels, according to Dell. The prior version of IPS Black offered a 2,000:1 contrast ratio. A comparison showing <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPXQdLfKMRs">improvements in contrast ratio can be seen in this YouTube video</a>.</p><div><figcaption><em>Besides some changes to the port selection and a new ventilation grill, the new UltraSharp 4K monitors look visually similar to the previous models.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Dell</cite></p></div><p>Dell says the monitors include an ambient light sensor that automatically adjusts brightness and color temperature to help reduce eye fatigue. Otherwise, the 27-inch and 32-inch 4K UltraSharp share near-identical designs with their predecessors. The new models include VESA DisplayHDR 600 and ports for USB-A, USB-C, Thunderbolt 4, HDMI, and DisplayPort, with ventilation grills now surrounding the ports located on the back of the monitors.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The Radeon RX 9070 XT and Radeon RX 9070 will both be available in Q1 from a variety of video card manufacturers, but AMD isn’t detailing specifications, pricing, or exact release dates just yet.</p><p>The announcement is light on concrete information. AMD says it has built this architecture from the ground up and that the GPUs built on RDNA 4 will include “a significant boost in AI.” AMD has optimized the compute units in RNDA 4, improved its ray-tracing engine and performance, and upgraded its media encoding quality. Built on a 4nm process, the RX 9070 XT and RX 9070 cards will include AMD’s second-generation AI accelerators, third-generation ray-tracing accelerators, and second-generation radiance display engine.</p><div><figcaption><em>AMD is only providing small details about its RDNA 4 architecture.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: AMD</cite></p></div><p>This RDNA 4 architecture will also enable AMD to launch FSR 4 with these 9000-series GPUs. FSR 4 is a machine learning-powered update to AMD’s <a href="https://www.amd.com/en/products/graphics/technologies/fidelityfx/super-resolution.html">upscaling and frame-generation technology</a> that’s been developed specifically for RDNA 4 and its dedicated AI accelerator hardware. That means you’ll only be able to get FSR 4 with a Radeon RX 9070-series graphics card right now, and it will be supported in games with FSR 3.1 already integrated.</p><p>Matt Booty, president of game content and studios at Microsoft, appeared on stage at AMD’s CES keynote earlier today to confirm FSR 4 will be available in <em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 </em>later this year.</p><p>AMD hasn’t hinted at how FSR 4 will compare to Nvidia’s DLSS technology or what type of performance uplift or image quality improvement we should expect to see with this next generation of FSR.</p><p>It’s also not clear exactly what performance the RX 9070 series of GPUs will deliver against the competition, but in a branding slide for RDNA 4, AMD appears to suggest the 9070 series will offer similar performance to the Nvidia GeForce RTX 4070 Ti and RTX 4070 Super. Nvidia is expected to announce its <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/5/24336321/nvidia-rtx-5090-32gb-vram-gddr7-memory-ces-leak-rumor">RTX 50-series GPUs</a> later today.</p><div><figcaption><em>FSR 4 will use dedicated AI accelerators on next-gen GPUs to upscale games.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: AMD</cite></p></div><p>AMD is also adding new AI-powered features to its Adrenalin software. These include the ability to generate images with AI models, summarize local documents, and ask an AMD chatbot questions about graphics settings and more.&nbsp;</p><p>If you’re wondering why AMD has jumped from the Radeon 7000 series straight to 9000-series GPUs, the company says it will use the 8000-series branding for RDNA 3.5 mobile GPUs. AMD is only previewing FSR 4 at CES and promises to provide more details on the upscaling technology and its latest RDNA 4 GPUs ahead of the Q1 launch.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
