			<p>Do you remember <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/03/20/castle-crashers-remastered-heads-to-switch-and-playstation-4/">Castle Crashers</a>? Well, the developers of Big Helmet Heroes certainly do, as their game bears an uncanny resemblance to The Behemoth’s 2D side-scrolling shiny knight classic. Indeed, Big Helmet Heroes could well be Castle Crashers 2, only this time with bland 3D visuals replacing the charming hand-drawn aesthetic of The Behemoth’s finest. Oh, there’s one other noticeable difference between the two games I’m afraid; unlike Castle Crashers, Big Helmet Heroes isn’t very good.</p>
<p><iframe title="Big Helmet Heroes - Release Date Trailer | PS5 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rreierpDUas?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Big Helmet Heroes certainly starts off promisingly enough, your large-bonced knight – and one other pal in local co-op – trundle from left to right, hacking up Medieval-themed minions. It’s your standard side-scrolling beat ‘em up fare, though with a couple of neat additions. As you hack and slash through lava filled labyrinths, foreboding castles, neon-soaked amusement arcades, and atop an enormous electric guitar – yes, really – you’ll rescue other Big Helmeted Heroes who can be added to your team for that level. This enables you to switch out characters, your tagged-out warrior gaining health as they rest on the sidelines. A well-timed swap out is vital to reach the end of later levels, demanding close monitoring of your various hero’s health levels. Admittedly, this doesn’t add much to the proceedings, but it’s a little bit of brain that serves to accentuate the lashings of brawn.</p>


<p>In comparison to many of the recent side-scrolling beat ‘em ups I’ve played; there’s also the welcome addition of literally hundreds of amusing over-the-top weapons to pick-up and unleash on your unwitting opponents. You’ll be zapping enemies with electric flyswatters, launching laser beams at them from futuristic space-rifles, and smashing them to oblivion with massive plastic toy hammers. It’s all very fun, silly, and satisfying, exactly as it should be.</p>


<p>Each hero, despite the visual differences, plays pretty much the same, with identikit moves and attack combos. What diversifies them are rather entertaining ultimate attacks that freshen up the never-ending combat. A highlight is summoning a horde of angry sheep to trample your foes beneath their cute chunky hooves; but turning into a giant to stomp puny henchmen and making everyone battle in John Woo slow-mo proved a laugh too. Levels also benefit from a welcome touch of imagination and creativity; at one point the camera switches to a birds-eye view, your knights now tasked with navigating a hay-bale maze. Or there’s a battle at sea which turns into a light-gun shooter for the closing moments, or occasions when the game switches over into a survival mode, enemies attacking in waves whilst you defend your position.</p>
<p>Keeping 2D side-scrolling beat ‘em ups engaging through to their conclusion isn’t a straightforward proposition, they are, through their defining mechanic, deeply repetitive, yet developers Exalted Studio have certainly taken a welcome stab at it.</p>
<p>So, where does it all go wrong? Primarily, Big Helmet Heroes, on PS5 at least, is unbelievably janky. Collision detection is laughable, particularly when it comes to the awfully implemented bosses, with attacks failing to register at all. It’s not just attacks either, the Big Helmet Heroes can’t seem to stay attached to the ground – when navigating bridges or platforms, they’ll just plunge off for no good reason, almost as if the game deliberately steers your player character into an early demise. This issue gets worse and worse as you make your way further into the game, rendering some sections nigh unplayable.</p>

<p>Then there’s the camera, which is broken, failing to show the on-screen action most of the time. All too often you’ll be battling enemies off-screen, the camera demanding it shows you empty environments instead of &nbsp;your player character. The camera is even worse during those aforementioned boss fights, failing to keep up with the action at all. One notable example against a giant octopus was dreadful, my partner and I making it through by button mashing, unable to see what we were doing. Perhaps those Big Helmet Heroes needed even bigger heads? At least that way they might stay on screen.</p>

			<p>It seems ridiculous that the last Civilization entry - not including any DLC - came over eight years ago. In the games industry, not being seen for eight years generally means you've been put out to pasture, or more accurately, the money-men have milked you for everything you're worth, and they've gone Ol' Yeller on you. Since I adored Civilization VI, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/civilization-vi-review-journey/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">giving it a near-perfect score</a>, and my general love of the franchise, I've been understandably excited about Civilization VII as the series comes close to its 35th anniversary.</p>
<p>Having played a few games across over sixty hours, some of which I didn't finish and others of which I achieved a victory, I have some thoughts about Civilization VII. A question that seems to be repeating is, "Why?". Sometimes, it's meant positively; other times, it is not.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Civilization-VII-Review-02-Combat-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Civilization VII has made some sweeping changes, some for the better, others for the worse. At least at launch, it doesn't have a grand sandbox feel, arguably the most significant change. That is the first "Why?" This is the most directed Civilization entry ever, partly due to what feels like a shrinking of the game and the inclusion of the age system borrowed from Humankind.</p>
<p>Starting with the map options. You can pick between Tiny, Small, and Average. This gives you a maximum civilisation number of eight in a game. I should point out that, according to my calculations, the map size is roughly the same as that of Civilization VI, though I generally play on larger maps, so I'm not having much luck with this as everything is so compact.</p>
<p>A case in point is the spacing of cities. The AI doesn't seem to mind a lack of optimisation, so despite each city taking up a maximum space of three from the centre, the AI will have some far too close, hindering their chances of growing. With the first campaign I played to the end (winning despite not having finished any of the four paths), I figure there's enough space for a maximum of 70 well-spaced cities (or towns. From here on, when I write cities, I mean cities or towns)</p>
<p>You do have a city cap, which expands over time based on tech and social upgrades you research, but for you to reach that, there's maybe enough space on a map for three civilizations. This is after the advertised "map expansion" as you get to the second age, which isn't a map expansion in any real sense; it was always there; it's just that you don't have the required tech to go over there yet. It also seems that the AI is hamstrung in the second age, as I didn't notice any of them generating treasure fleets - or even trying to make it over to my continent, for that matter.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Civilization-VII-Review-03-Age-Ranking-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Let's talk about the Age system. Unlike Humankind, Civilization VII has three ages, compared to seven eras. This is a good decision, as it doesn't split the game up too much. The move from age to age is something I like, with caveats. The ages can be irritating in that they can be too quick. I'm watching the age percentage tick by, and it's probably a good sign that I don't want it to end. I've found myself disappointed and frustrated that it's finished, if only because I haven't been able to make my way down a particular path.</p>
<p>This would be another "why?" for which I have a solution: Don't end an age when one faction has generated enough points across all victory paths; end it when at least one path has been achieved. As Ibn Battuta, I wanted to get the Silk Road victory that takes us to the next generation, but because I happened to do a little in science, I was locked out as I had enough advancement points to move the world ahead. Another example is that I won a whole campaign as Revolutionary Napoleon without achieving a single path across all three ages.</p>
<p>You could argue that this shows flexibility and allows for a jack-of-all-trades style approach. It's also a bit of a blue-ball situation, where I could be close to getting a space race victory to winning because I happened to build a bloody theatre. In my actual save, it was because I took a city. I wish the game were more flexible with this, letting people at least achieve something. It desperately needs an option that enables you to delay the end of an age and another that is essentially a conquest victory from the old games.</p>
<p>The only downside is that you must select some adverse effects as you approach the end of an age—the game calls this a crisis period. How accurate is it that every single age had a world-spanning crisis towards the end? I don't know, but it's the mechanic we have. Now, I wonder if the AI also gets this, because I never see them suffering the same issues as me! This could still be left in if only to disincentivise staying in age for too long when you could click to advance.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Civilization-VII-Review-04-Crisis-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>This is how the age system and civilisations work in Civilization VII. You pick a leader who lasts throughout the game and then a civilisation from the respective era. You don't have to start in the age of antiquity; you can drop in a game at a later era if wanted, though I think that takes away from the story element that Firaxis is going for. The whole idea is that you are evolving through the ages.</p>
<p>Adding to the feel of this being an evolution, you are restricted to what civilisation you can move to in the following age. Generally speaking, it's based on geography and historical accuracy. However, this can be circumvented by meeting set targets. For example, even as Amina (North African warrior princess), you can unlock the Incas for the following age by having multiple mountains in your cities.</p>
<p>An annoyance with the age system, though, is also that it soft-resets even your empire. I'm not a fan that you can have multiple cities, but - unless you have something to stop this - all bar your capital is reverted to a town, which means you must again pay gold to move it to a city. This can be even if it has the proper expansion, size, and buildings of a city. Parts of the soft reset, to give those behind a chance to be closer again, make sense - but it's a little too much sometimes.</p>
<p>Here's also where I have a bit of a "why?". Now, I've been called "woke" more than a few times, and if you go with the insane notion that believing in equality and acceptance is woke, then so be it. Still, I don't understand the choice of leaders in Civilization VII. I'm far from nationalistic, but we - the British - had the most prominent and influential empire ever. To not have somebody British, and it doesn't have to be militaristic, is insane. Shakespeare for culture, Newton or Darwin for science, Brunel for economics, the options are limitless.</p>
<p>I find that a little more limiting and perplexing when you have multiples of certain leaders: Ashoka (Maurya—India), Frederik (Prussia), Himiko (China), and Xerxes (Persia), plus Napoleon. That's five leaders doubled up to give a slightly different version. I think the omission of Britain, Greece (Alexander the Great?), any Scandinavian country, and some South American leaders or empires, despite their localised nature, is questionable, to say the least. Of course, some or all of these could be already announced DLC that releases close to launch, but that doesn't make the criticism moot.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Civilization-VII-Review-05-Incas-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>That I've said so much without even going into the finer details of gameplay should say a lot. I will make it simple and say the turn-by-turn play of Civilization VII is fantastic, even if some of the broader elements give me mixed feelings. There is more strategy and planning in this, particularly with city building, thanks to an overhaul of how you build, as each hex that makes part of your city as you expand will be either an urban or rural part of the city.</p>
<p>When you select a hex as the city grows, it becomes a rural part of the city, utilising the available resources on the tile. Each hex can hold up to two regular buildings or one wonder. Each hex is also separate when building city walls, so it will take some time if you have a big city, and location also comes very much into this, as your walls won't be crossing any rivers.</p>
<p>Walls - and other buildings - also can't be built over the "resources" that you can find on certain tiles, so depending on if you have a town, which can't hold every building or a city which can, will determine where you want to build, as these can limit expansion quite significantly. Of course, they are extremely valuable in their own right, significantly boosting development in many ways.</p>
<p>When it comes to rivers, they are probably the most impactful change in navigating Civilization VII. Rivers are now divided into two different types: navigable and non-navigable. Both will take up one hex, but you will be able to tell the difference. The navigable ones act as inland waterways for ships; you can also build on them, having your dock slightly away from the coast. It looks fantastic how the city is built around features like rivers, and having them be used as actual inland waterways is a game-changer for naval manoeuvrability.</p>
<p>In the city building, there is also another feature: overbuilding. As you move into a new age, you will naturally find new tech and buildings. Certain buildings and wonders are there until the end of the game, but a new structure can replace all others. Another thing with the building system is that certain civilisations have unique districts created by building two specific structures on the same hex, giving you an additional bonus. It allows for more tactical and strategic city-building, over-building on the districts introduced in the last entry.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Civilization-VII-Review-06-Over-building-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Other new or enhanced features also include natural disasters, which are more localised. Floods, volcanic eruptions, sandstorms, and tornados can and will damage your structures and units. It's hazardous to settle on a reasonably active river, as I found out in my Napoleon campaign - the Tiber tended to floor at least every fifth turn, meaning I found myself paying for repairs far more than I would have liked to. Of course, all of this is controllable by turning them off or up, depending on how masochistic you are.</p>
<p>I've covered other aspects of the settings and the shortcomings of the lack of large maps and open-ended game options, so there's a little to discuss regarding length and difficulty. I haven't found this overly different from other games in the series, with longer games simply adding a multiplier to everything. The only thing I think has seen an improvement with difficulty, and also due to a change in the game, is diplomacy.</p>
<p>Firaxis certainly watched Amplitude and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/humankind-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Humankind</a> regarding some things, and diplomacy is one of them. Diplomacy now uses a new resource called influence, which is also used in your dealings with city-states. The options in diplomacy also feel less easy to game. In most strategy games before, including Civ, it was too easy to bend the AI by simply throwing gold at them, twiddling with the "we like you meter" based on simple input. This doesn't seem as easy now, and the AI's favourability towards you appears to be based more on your longer-term agreements.</p>
<p>If I have a problem with the AI, it's the city-states. Even on the lower difficulties, I find them overly aggressive, and more are unfriendly from the get-go than friendly. It proves to be one of the more limiting factors for early expansion when you've got a random tribe deciding that - even before meeting you - you're the devil spawn and must be destroyed, yet the other civilisations are fine.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Civilization-VII-Review-07-Mementos-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Which brings us to combat. This is another area where Civilization VII has seen some changes. The single-unit per tile system remains, with an adjustment to how types of stacking work. You can't stack units as with Civilization VI; you can recruit a commander to group several units, essentially making an army group. This allows you to transport units quickly. However, be warned that these groups don't have the fighting power of the units inside them; you need to deploy for combat.</p>
<p>Combat remains as expected from the series, with tweaks to how ranged units can attack and how terrain and height impact this. This makes it more tactical and adds more to the game. With this, the move to more realistic terrain from the last game, carried on here, keeps its impact. Honestly, though, I haven't seen the end of combat because, as mentioned earlier, the age system essentially hamstrings me and cuts me off before I experience it all.</p>
<p>With my usual narrative style now broken, I'm just listing things. Another new feature, which I think is partly why the game pushes for such quick conclusions, is the character and civilisation levelling systems. As you play, you gain experience. As you gain experience, your chosen leader - and the civilisation you are - level up by completing specific objectives. Other objectives also unlock "mementos" you can equip when starting a new game, giving you a slight boost.</p>
<p>I must say that I haven't played enough online to give you an accurate representation of that yet. I'm now on it with others, but that's for another piece, though the above is a way to bring more of an online progression system to the game.</p>
<p>Also, it looks and sounds great. I'm not going to go into that much detail on the aesthetics. But, the soundtrack is fantastic, with Christoper Tin knocking the theme out of the park again (I still prefer Sogno di Volare), each civ having its theme, and great effects in battle. The same is true for the visuals, with even the smaller elements like disasters and the units in combat having the details to make them stand out and fit in simultaneously.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/Civilization-VII-Review-08-Wonder-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>My first maybe five hours with Civilization VII left me feeling a little despondent. I didn't have the same enthusiasm from the early gameplay that previous entries gave me. I am still questioning certain decisions, and I believe the speed and forced end of an age and the limitations of maps are fundamentally holding the game back. It gives Firaxis the narrative push they want, but lacking the ability of an open-ended game that Civilization has been from 1991 baffles me.</p>
<p>Now, even with that, I can't deny for a second that the more I have played this, and the more times I've started a game, I've been sucked into it. With over sixty hours on the clock, I've explored much of what the game has to offer, and what it offers is great. It keeps the series's one more turn aspect alive and kicking, and I've more than a few times found myself thinking, "Should be asleep now."</p>
<p>I genuinely think most of the changes are for the better, though some things, like how much of a reset an age gives, could be toned back a little. I also want an option to stop an age forcing itself on me, and I want a game on a huge map where I can reach the end I want. What I want, ironically, is "Just one more turn." This would have been the series' best if it hadn't been for some omissions and questionable decisions. Whatever my misgivings, this is still an incredibly addictive game.</p>

					<h2>Civilization VII</h2>
				</div>
			
						<section>
				<p>Civilization VII is a great game, that's the simple answer. With an improved city-building system, terrain features, and diplomacy, there is much to like in the new release of the three-and-a-half decade old franchise. However, long-time fans of the series will find some of the omissions, such as the ability to turn off victory conditions other than domination, limiting. This, and the rapid nature of the ages, will also leave some feeling that the epic nature of some longer games is altogether missing. Still, even with the games feeling a little rushed, the one-more-turn that makes Civilization one of the best series ever remains there.</p>
				<div>
												<ul>
							<h6>Pros</h6>
							<li>City and Town development is fantastically done, and adds a whole new layer to the game.
</li><li>Improved diplomacy removes some of the exploits found in previous games.
</li><li>Terrain features like navigable rivers add a whole new element to both army movement and city building.
</li><li>Gorgeous looking and sounding game.</li>						</ul>
																		<ul>

							<li>The age system forces itself upon you, and can impact the enjoyability of a game - particularly towards the very end.
</li><li>Map sizes are too small, removing the "grand" feel that came with larger maps in previous entries.

                <p>Microsoft has embarked on a new multiplatform direction for several of its Xbox games, and former PlayStation boss Shawn Layden believes that this new initiative could work in the company's favor if handled correctly--much like it has for Sega. Layden believes that Microsoft can benefit from having a wider market to sell its games to as part of its new multiplatform strategy, but the downside to this is that it could possibly make it harder for the company to attract more people to its platform.</p><p>"Multiplatform is a strategy, particularly in a world where the cost of development is increasing dramatically," Layden said to YouTube channel <a href="https://youtu.be/UAcM-xmUegs?t=2968" rel="nofollow ">Kiwi Talks</a>. "Multiplatform means widening your addressable market, as the marketing guys say. How do you create the fear of missing out, trying to do that by bringing everyone to your platform? Saying, 'If you're not here you're missing out,' but if it's available on all platforms, that's one of your marketing tactics. You can't say it's only available here if it's available everywhere. So it's a balancing act, right? I'm increasing my addressable market, that's good. I'm making it harder to sell only on my platform."</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UAcM-xmUegs" data-width="100%" data-height="100%" data-video-start="2968">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/UAcM-xmUegs?start=2968" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>As Layden noted, there was precedent for this shift in business tactics, as following the launch and poor sales of the Dreamcast, Sega dropped out of the console hardware race to focus on developing and publishing video games. "We've seen it before. I mean I was in the business when Sega brought their Dreamcast titles to PlayStation 2. And in time, Sega became a software-only company and have been a great transformation in that respect," Layden said.</p><p>Microsoft has two big games on the way to PS5 consoles this year. Last year it was confirmed that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-whips-up-4-million-players-before-ps5-debut/1100-6529145/">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle would reach that platform</a> several months after its Xbox and PC launch, and last week, the company revealed that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/forza-horizon-5-is-the-next-xbox-game-to-speed-onto-playstation-5/1100-6529156/">Forza Horizon 5 will also race onto PS5 in spring</a>.</p><p>In terms of hardware, Xbox Series X|S sales are reportedly behind the Xbox One at the same point in both of their lifecycles, while the PS5 is outpacing the PS4. The good news for Microsoft is that its multiplatform approach appears to be paying off <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/despite-xboxs-struggles-in-hardware-microsoft-was-reportedly-the-top-video-game-publisher-in-december/1100-6529088/">as it was apparently the number-one video game publisher in December 2024</a> thanks partly to its Call of Duty games.</p>

                <p>Sid Meier's Civilization is known for being one of the most brutal <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-strategy-games/2900-5977/" data-ref-id="2900-5977">strategy games</a> you can play at the highest difficulty level. Of course, if you're looking for a more laid-back experience or you're a new player, the franchise has always let you swap to a lower difficulty. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/sid-meiers-civilization-vii/" data-ref-id="5000-631817">Civilization VII</a> has brought back the difficulty levels and options from previous games, but they're not a copy-and-paste list of settings.</p><p>There are several difficulty levels, different map types and lengths, and other advanced settings that you'll want to know about before hopping into Civilization VII. The guide below explains how to change your difficulty level and everything about customizing your game.</p><h2>How to change difficulty in Civilization 7</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4431083-civ7screenshot2025.01.19-15.27.26.32.png" data-ref-id="1300-4431083" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4431083-civ7screenshot2025.01.19-15.27.26.32.png" data-ref-id="1300-4431083"></a><figcaption>The difficulty options in Civilization VII</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4431083-civ7screenshot2025.01.19-15.27.26.32.png"></figure><p>First and foremost, let's go over how and where to change between the game's various difficulty levels. Unlike other games, this can't be done by going to the settings menu and flipping between the different levels. Instead, you have to start up a new game and go through a few menus before you're able to customize the difficulty level and other options in Civilization VII.</p><p>However, there's also a massive caveat with the difficulty level. In our version of the game on PC, <strong>we were</strong> <strong>not able to change the difficulty or set any other game options until after our first game was over</strong>. Once we beat one run, we could start a new game and access all the difficulty options. It's unclear if this is a bug or an intended feature.</p><p>To change the difficulty level, follow the steps below:</p><ul><li>Launch Civilization VII and press "New Game" from the main menu</li><li>Choose your desired Leader and Age and Civilization. It's highly recommended to always start from the Antiquity Age, as that's the formal beginning of the game.</li><li>Click "Continue" at the bottom of the screen to go to the "Confirm" tab</li><li>Here, you can access all the difficulty settings</li><li>The top option is your overall difficulty, and here are the different levels:  <ul><li>Scribe</li><li>Governor</li><li>Viceroy</li><li>Sovereign</li><li>Immortal</li><li>Deity</li></ul></li><li>The levels go from easiest to strongest, so for a standard playthrough, select either Governor or Viceroy</li><li>Once you're done with the difficulty level, you can customize the options below it before officially starting your game</li><li>Be warned, <strong>once you launch your game, you can't change the difficulty level</strong> or game options again unless you start a new save</li></ul><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4431084-civ7screenshot2025.01.19-02.52.04.92.png" data-ref-id="1300-4431084" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4431084-civ7screenshot2025.01.19-02.52.04.92.png" data-ref-id="1300-4431084"></a><figcaption>The victory screen after winning a game</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4431084-civ7screenshot2025.01.19-02.52.04.92.png"></figure><p>As we mentioned before, if you're loading up your first game of Civilization VII, the option to select your difficulty level might not be there. If what we experienced is intended, then it should take you roughly 10-15 hours of playtime to beat one run of the game on standard difficulty. After that point, you can make a new game and choose your difficulty options.</p><h2>All difficulty options in Civilization VII</h2><p>In addition to the difficulty levels in Civilization VII, you can also change a variety of game options. These include map type, game length, age length, and more. We'll go more in depth with each of those settings below:</p><p><strong>Game Speed </strong></p><ul><li>Online</li><li>Quick</li><li>Standard</li><li>Epic</li><li>Marathon</li></ul><p>This determines how long every game takes in turns and the number of overall turns per age. If you want a massive campaign that drags on for 30 hours, choose Marathon. However, most players will likely feel comfortable with Standard or Epic.</p><p><strong>Map Type </strong></p><ul><li>Continents Plus</li><li>Continents</li><li>Archipelago</li><li>Fractal</li><li>Shuffle</li><li>Terra Incognita</li></ul><p>Your map type is an important choice, as it controls what lands you'll be able to traverse. The standard option is Continents Plus, which gives you two continents to explore and some islands in between them. Continents takes out the islands while Archipelago makes it so your continents are broken up by islands. Fractal makes the continents more connected and offers less water between them. Then, Shuffle makes your map type random while Terra Incognita gives you one normal continent and a random second one.</p><p><strong>Map Size </strong></p><ul><li>Tiny</li><li>Small</li><li>Standard</li></ul><p>Finally, your map size determines the overall scale of the map you get to explore. Naturally, tiny and small sizes make for quicker games, as there's less to traverse and do. So, it's usually recommended for players to stick to the standard map size.</p><p><strong>Advanced Options </strong></p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4431085-civ7screenshot2025.01.19-15.28.28.73.png" data-ref-id="1300-4431085" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4431085-civ7screenshot2025.01.19-15.28.28.73.png" data-ref-id="1300-4431085"></a><figcaption>Advanced Options give you more difficulty choices</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4431085-civ7screenshot2025.01.19-15.28.28.73.png"></figure><ul><li>Age Length: Abbreviated, Standard, Long</li><li>Disaster Intensity: Light, Moderate, Catastrophic</li><li>Crises: Yes or No</li></ul><p>Advanced Options further customizes your game. The age length setting allows you to make your games shorter or longer depending on what game speed you set. Disasters and crises offer the chance to make things easier or harder on yourself. If you want a harder experience, turn crises on and pump disasters up to catastrophic level. However, neither of these settings will have too big of an effect on the difficulty unless you're playing on the higher difficulty levels.</p><p>You can also change the "Player Settings" within the Advanced Options menu. This allows you to set the world leaders you'll meet during a game and what civilizations they control. While this doesn't have a huge impact on difficulty, you can make your experience tougher by selecting leaders that are "militaristic." This makes them more prone to war, which is generally what difficulty levels are based on.</p><p>There's so much to learn and discover when you're exploring the massive world of Civ 7.

Not only do they improve all of the pertinent stats your empire needs to sustain itself, but they also improve relations with neighboring leaders. The more resources your civilization has access to, the better off you'll be.</p><p>The best way to acquire resources outside your settlements owning resource tiles is by establishing trade routes. Trade routes can only be established by merchants, who are individual units you can produce or purchase in a city or town. However, the process of using your merchants is not as simple as it sounds in Civilization 7.</p><h2>How to get Merchants in Civilization 7</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4432918-civ7screenshot2025.01.17-22.14.28.93.png" data-ref-id="1300-4432918" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4432918-civ7screenshot2025.01.17-22.14.28.93.png" data-ref-id="1300-4432918"></a><figcaption>The message that grants you access to Merchants</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4432918-civ7screenshot2025.01.17-22.14.28.93.png"></figure><p>Merchants are one of the earlier units you can produce in Civilization VII. In our initial playthrough, we were first able to produce a merchant at the 50% mark of the Antiquity Age. You'll know you can start producing merchants when you see the first "Trade Opportunity" message appear during one of your turns. The message will state that a neighboring leader has abundant resources, and you should send a merchant to set up a trade route with them.</p><p>When you get this message, go to your capital city and scroll down the production units until you see "Merchant." The merchant takes roughly three or four turns to produce, but you can also purchase one for around 400 gold. Merchants can be produced in cities or bought in towns.</p><p>Once your merchant has been produced, you need to choose where they go to establish a trade route. By selecting the merchant during a turn, you'll see all the possible trade routes they can visit. These trade routes directly result from how many leaders you've met and all of their settlements you've discovered.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4432919-civ7screenshot2025.01.17-22.52.55.65.png" data-ref-id="1300-4432919" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4432919-civ7screenshot2025.01.17-22.52.55.65.png" data-ref-id="1300-4432919"></a><figcaption>Producing a Merchant in Civilization VII</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4432919-civ7screenshot2025.01.17-22.52.55.65.png"></figure><h2>How to establish Trade Routes in Civilization 7</h2><p>During your first turn with a merchant, select the settlement you want to set up a trade route with. You mainly want to look for what settlement has the most resources to offer, but you can also specialize your trade route if you're looking for one or two specific resources.</p><p>If you want to set up more possible trade routes, you need to discover more of the map and other leaders' settlements. The merchant also needs to be within a certain range of possible locations. With this in mind, it's wise to produce merchants at different settlements within your empire so you have a more extensive selection of places to go.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4432920-civ7screenshot2025.01.17-22.16.08.76.png" data-ref-id="1300-4432920" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4432920-civ7screenshot2025.01.17-22.16.08.76.png" data-ref-id="1300-4432920"></a><figcaption>Your first look at the Merchant screen</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4432920-civ7screenshot2025.01.17-22.16.08.76.png"></figure><p>You can send multiple merchants to the same settlement to establish a trade route. However, this requires going to a leader's portrait page and spending Influence to set up additional trade routes. You can only do this with leaders who are friendly or neutral with you. Leaders who you're warring with or have a negative relationship with will generally reject any trade route proposals.</p><p>You can see the status of your relationship with a leader by going to their portrait and selecting the tab with a heart and number on it. If the number is green, you're in good standing with the leader, but the leader is hostile towards you if it's red.</p><p>Returning to setting up trade routes, once you have selected the settlement you want to visit, select it from the "Possible Trade Routes" menu. Then, your game will take you to that location on the map. From here, right-click on the capital of the settlement and you'll send your merchant off on their journey.</p><p>Depending on how far the settlement is from your merchant's starting location, they could take several turns to reach their destination. Don't worry, though, as the merchants are automated, so you don't have to control each turn individually.</p><p>When the merchant arrives at the settlement, they'll be given a turn, and you have to decide what to do with them. To establish a trade route with the settlement they're in, view their box in the bottom-right and press the icon with two arrows and a plus sign, as seen in the screenshot below.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4432914-civ7screenshot2025.01.18-15.30.49.02.png" data-ref-id="1300-4432914" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4432914-civ7screenshot2025.01.18-15.30.49.02.png" data-ref-id="1300-4432914"></a><figcaption>Choosing to establish a trade route to another settlement</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4432914-civ7screenshot2025.01.18-15.30.49.02.png"></figure><p>This establishes a trade route with the settlement, granting you the resources it offers. From there, your merchant will disappear and you can allocate your newfound resources to cities or towns. If you send your merchant to a city, the resources in return can only be allocated to one of your cities. However, merchants visiting a town will grant you bonus resources, which can be allocated to cities or towns in your empire.</p><p>Your other option with the merchant is to send them to another settlement. This forgoes the establishment of a trade route. Generally, you want to ensure you're always establishing a trade route once your merchant arrives at their destination, or else you're just wasting turns with them traveling all over the map.</p><p>It's usually wise to have at least one or two merchants roaming the map in Civilization VII. This earns you more resources, increases your relationship with other leaders, and lets you increase the stats of your settlements.</p><p>There's so much to learn and discover when you're exploring the massive world of Civ 7.

Almost impossibly “expensive” to use, what were presumably measures to prevent real-money markets and scalpers have led to a system that is so punitive to players as to be useless. Thankfully, developers Creatures, Inc. and DeNA have since released a statement saying they recognize all is not OK.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196165" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="What’s Coming Out Beyond Pokémon: The Indigo Disk | The Week In Games" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="95" data-playlist="196165,194741,196790" data-current="196165"><div><p>What’s Coming Out Beyond Pokémon: The Indigo Disk | The Week In Games</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196165/196165_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196165/196165_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196165/196165_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196165/196165_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21711.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p><em>Pocket</em>’s trading is a ghastly mess. If you want to trade, say, a single one-star rarity card (typically a non-ex full-art card), you’ll require 400 trade tokens, which presently can only be gained by <em>destroying</em> four other one-star cards. Then, to trade for a card you actually want, you need to be in direct communication with the other person outside of the application, as there’s no way to communicate such information within. It’s very poor, and thank goodness, the negative reaction appears to have been heard.</p><p>“Since releasing the first iteration of the trading feature a few days ago,” <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/PokemonTCGP/status/1885447974094070090&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/PokemonTCGP/status/1885447974094070090" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">says a statement from the developers via X</a></span>, “we have received a large number of comments. Thank you all for sharing your feedback.”</p><p>The statement goes on to explain that the “requirements and restrictions” are there to prevent bots and malfeasance, and all this was done out of a desire to “maintain a fair environment for all players.” But, they go on, “we understand that some of the restrictions put in place are preventing players from being able to casually enjoy the feature as intended.” The developers are now investigating ways to improve things, as well as promising more ways to accrue trade tokens, “including through event distributions.”</p><p>What’s so interesting here is how this obnoxiously terrible feature was so obviously flawed. People didn’t discover the design’s issues through extensive experimentation, nor did they only show up once a large audience was participating. Instead it was, at a glance, blatantly horrible. You needed to destroy swathes of your most precious cards (and if sacrificial, inherently the very cards you would have wanted to trade away) to be able to get a single new one, and you couldn’t just click a button to say which card you wanted in return! The developers <em>had</em> to know it was awful—it’s inconceivable that they could not.</p><p>Yet, trading is extremely tricky ground for <em>Pokémon</em>. With the real-life versions of the cards, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-prismatic-evolutions-prices-umbreon-1851747243&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-prismatic-evolutions-prices-umbreon-1851747243">as we’ve been reporting for a while</a></span>, prices for the rarest new cards are hitting all-time highs—we’re talking $1,500 for a single card from the most recent set. Being physical objects, The Pokémon Company International (TPCi) and Creatures aren’t able to impinge on such resale markets, and can only exercise any level of control by producing more product for people to buy. But here, in this digital-only realm, there was a presumed ability to prevent such a second-hand market growing out of control.</p><p>The problem is, there isn’t an elegant or reasonable way to allow a pleasant in-game trading mechanic that cannot be exploited by third-party marketplaces. If it exists in any practical way, it will immediately be exploited by those wishing to more easily secure the specific cards they want, and those wishing to take people’s money to allow them to do so. The only solution is to create an in-app version of the feature that’s as good as anything anyone’s offering externally, rather than making the act of trading so actively unpleasant and punishing that no one would ever want to pay to do it.</p><p>Oddly enough, TPCi <em>has</em> done this successfully before! The original digital version of the <em>Pokémon</em> trading card game, <em>PTCG Online</em>, had a fantastic in-app trading function. You publicly listed the card you were offering and the card you wanted in exchange, and then anyone else could search for the card <em>they</em> want, and see if they had the requested trade. Click, boom, done. For reasons TPCi has chosen never to divulge, the trading feature was removed entirely <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-live-online-migrate-card-game-tips-guide-1849789809&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-live-online-migrate-card-game-tips-guide-1849789809">when the forced switch to the poorer replacement app, <em>PTCG Live</em>, was implemented.</a></span></p><p>So it’s good news that feedback has been heard, but it remains very unlikely that trading will ever become the feature people have hoped for in <em>Pocket</em>, given the seeming reluctance to allow any sort of third-party marketplace. Let’s hope it at least makes a significant improvement. In the meantime, it seems, the app will find new ways to hand out piles of trading tokens.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p>Sometimes, video games are just pure, chaotic joy. Sure, we’ve got plenty of cosy adventures where you can pet the cat and launch a coffee shop, but unadulterated violence and mayhem are pretty popular (in the make-believe, pixellated forum, not so much in the real world. Sodaman is just about to launch into Early Access on the 17th of February, and this is one game where pixellated, chaotic violence looks as though it’s going to be a heck of a lot of fun.</p>
<p><iframe title="Sodaman - Official Release Date Gameplay Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9oDvs0dBmfo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Unsurprisingly, for a game called Sodaman, cans of soda (that’s pop to you UK readers), are integral and important, with Sodaman utilising his favourite fizzy beverages to power up his blasting and fighting powers. Set in a cyberpunk futuristic society, and pulling together the ever-popular Roguelike and Bullet Heaven genres, Sodaman has definitely taken a slurp of Hades and a sip of Death Must Die on its way to fruition. </p>
<p>Interestingly, the development team at Tape Corps have also included Balatro as in influence, so the way that you steadily improve your abilities in each run might take inspiration from there. Or you’re going to be firing Jokers at the bad guys that give you insane multipliers. Either sounds good.</p>
<p>While Sodamans powers are enhanced by the fizzy stuff, you can also pour them together to create hybrid, unusual drinks that are even more powerful. Like mixing Pepsi and Lilt. Wouldn’t that be something?</p>

<p>Sodaman, which will be published by GameDev.ist, will launch with a very reasonable price tag of $4.99 during Early Access on Steam. There’ll aslo be a 20% discount for two weeks following the Early Access exit. As you should expect, this is an unfinished project, and the team at Tape Corps will be paying close attention to player feedback during Early Access. It definitely looks like it’s worth jumping into!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/red-dead-redemption-2-has-set-another-new-all-time-peak-record-on-steam/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Red Dead Redemption 2 created two concurrent player peak records on Steam within a week, the latest one bringing the number to just under 100,000.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Just a week ago, Red Dead Redemption 2 hit a new all-time peak of 86,717 on Steam, beating the 2023 record of 77,655. The latest number has been topped, too. Spotted by <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/red-dead-red-dead-redemption-2-player-surge-on-steam-rockstar-games-sale/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">TheGamer</a>, RDR 2 hit an all-time peak of 99,993 in the past 24 hours (at the time of writing), according to <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1174180/charts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">SteamDB</a>. However, its new record is not even close to Rockstar’s 2013 hit title, GTA V, which managed to peak at 364,548 almost a decade ago and has brought in more than 200,000 players in the past 24 hours.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But what’s responsible for Red Dead Redemption 2 setting new player peak records on Steam? It’s none other than a discount, with Rockstar’s 2018 action-adventure game receiving a massive <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/red-dead-redeption-2-breaks-steam-concurrent/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">75% discount</a> on the platform, bringing its price down to $15. Grabbing Red Dead Redemption 2 for this price is an absolute steal, and the sale is not limited to RDR 2. The Rockstar Games Steam Sale offers up to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/sale/rockstarpublishersale2025?tab=3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">80% discount on their games</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Red Dead Redemption 2 features the most expansive and immersive open-world Rockstar has created, a world you could get lost in. If you don’t want to play the story, you can still get hours of content just by exploration, with each character in the open world having a new story and each corner opening a new secret. And that’s just one of the beauties of the games; the visuals, storytelling, character design and soundtrack of RDR 2 are second to none.&nbsp;</p>

What could Sony have up its sleeve for this year’s State of Play? It’s worth going through the first-party games it has announced and coming out in 2025. Sucker Punch’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/ghost-of-yotei">Ghost of Yotei</a> currently has a 2025 release window. Perhaps we’ll get a fresh look at gameplay and a release date.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Meanwhile, Bungie’s PvP extraction shooter <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/marathon">Marathon</a> may be set for a showing if it still plans to open playtesting up this year. There’s also <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/fairgame">Fairgames</a>, the debut game from Haven Studios. Naughty Dog recently announced its brand new IP, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet"><u>Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet</u></a>, and Insomniac is working on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/marvels-wolverine">Marvel’s Wolverine</a>. More likely, perhaps, is a fresh trailer for Hideo Kojima’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach">Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</a>, which is set for a 2025 release.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">What we won’t see are the various live service games Sony recently canned. Last month, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/playstation-cancels-two-unannounced-live-service-games"><u>Sony canceled two unannounced live-service games that were in development at Bend Studio and Bluepoint Games</u></a>.

Guerrilla Games' live service Horizon game reportedly survived the cull. Is it finally time for a reveal?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Moving on to potential third-party announcements, Kojima has <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/physint-hideo-kojima-action-espionage-project"><u>Physint</u></a>, the upcoming stealth-action PlayStation exclusive in the works, but it feels a little early for that. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/phantom-blade-zero"><u>Phantom Blade Zero</u></a>, the flashy hack-and-slash action RPG from Chinese studio S-Game, is a safer bet.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And let’s not forget Microsoft, now a significant publisher of games on PlayStation. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a> is set to launch on PS5 soon, so maybe we will see a release date announced.

"Our goal was to balance the game while maintaining a fair environment for all players and preserving the fun of collecting cards that is core to the Pokémon TCG Pocket experience.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"However, thanks to your feedback, we understand that some of the restrictions put in place are preventing players from being able to casually enjoy the feature as intended. We are actively investigating ways to improve the feature to address these concerns. Going forward, we also plan to offer multiple ways to obtain Trade Tokens including through event distributions."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The statement is essentially as vague as it gets, with Creatures Inc. offering neither specifics into what changes will be made or when they will arrive, but it at least confirms that community concerns are heard.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Players of Pokémon TCG Pocket are also left in the dark as to if their current trades will be refunded or compensated in any way, as if the Trade Token cost changes, those taking advantage of the feature in its opening days may lose much more than if they waited.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Creatures Inc. doesn't seem particularly determined to include Trade Tokens in events either, as it only made a total of 200 available as premium rewards to those who pay $9.99 a month for the Battle Pass when the refresh arrived on February 1. This is enough to trade a single 3 Diamond card, the lowest rarity that requires Trade Tokens to trade.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It also failed to include any as rewards in the aforementioned Cresselia ex Drop Event which arrived today. Players can pick up new promo cards, Pack Hourglasses, Shinedust, shop tickets, and experience from completing the events, but Creatures Inc. doesn't offer a single Trade Token despite its vow to do so just yesterday.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fans complained trading is fairly clearly being implemented as a means of increasing revenue for Pokémon TCG Pocket, which <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-tcg-pocket-estimated-to-have-crossed-200-million-mark-already-outperforming-pokmon-sleep-and-unite">is estimated to have made $200 million in its first month</a>, before trading was possible.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This is also evidenced by the inability to trade cards of 2 Star rarity or higher, as if players could immediately trade for their missing cards, they wouldn't need to spend $10 or $100 or more for a random chance of getting them. It cost one player around $1,500 just to complete the first set, for example, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-tcg-pocket-gets-space-time-smackdown-expansion-today-heres-everything-you-need-to-know">the third in three months arrived just a few days ago</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Players called the mechanic "predatory and downright greedy," "hilariously toxic," and a "monumental failure."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Ryan Dinsdale is an IGN freelance reporter.

<p>The new video, put together by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@RandomGaminginHD" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RandomGaminginHD</a>, shows the second entry in the series by Insomniac which launched last week on PC, running at 1080p upscaled from 360p base resolution by NVIDIA DLSS 4 at the Ultra Performance setting on an RTX 4060 GPU, which is far from being the most powerful GPU around. While it's clear how the game is upscaled to 1080p from a very low base resolution, NVIDIA DLSS 4 not only delivers an acceptable image quality, considering the base resolution, but also very solid performance, as the game achieves an average of around 90 FPS at the highest setting without ray tracing, and a respectable 53 FPS average with Ultimate Ray Tracing. All this bodes extremely well for the Nintendo Switch 2, which is said to support NVIDIA DLSS, as this image quality would be more than acceptable on a small 1080p screen. Hopefully, the Nintendo system will be able to use the new Transformer model that powers NVIDIA DLSS 4 without a big impact on performance.</p>

<p>Marvel’s Spider-Man 2, as mentioned above, launched on PC last week, but its launch was <a href="https://wccftech.com/marvels-spider-man-2-pc-isnt-off-to-a-great-start/">far from being the smoothest for PlayStation-to-PC ports</a>, as the game suffered from some critical crashing issues that prevented the vast majority of players from enjoying the game. Sony and developer Nixxes released a hotfix shortly after release to address the issue, although some are still experiencing crashes.</p>
<p>Marvel’s Spider-Man 2 is now available on PC and PlayStation 5 worldwide. You can learn more about the second entry in the series from Insomniac by checking out Alessio's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/marvels-spider-man-2-ultimate-incarnation/">review.</a></p>

            <p>Friendly skateboarding game <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/olliolli-world">OlliOlli World</a> and its rollerskating gun friend <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/rollerdrome">Rollerdrome</a> have been delisted on Steam for unknown reasons. If you go to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1190170/OlliOlli_World/">the store page</a> for OlliOlli World, you'll currently see the classic delisted message: "Notice: OlliOlli World is no longer available on the Steam store." The same thing appears on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1294420/Rollerdrome/">the Rollerdrome page</a>. No, we're not sure why. </p>

<p>Buckle up, there are layers of ownership here. The skating games were developed by Roll7 and published under Private Division. But Roll7 were shut down last year by uber-owner Take-Two Interactive, who reportedly sold Private Division to Haveli Investments, an equity firm from Austin in the US. Haveli are <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/former-annapurna-staff-reportedly-found-new-studio-to-rescue-sold-off-private-division-projects-including-new-game-freak-game">reportedly funding</a> the new venture from staff who <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/annapurna-interactives-entire-staff-resign-following-dispute-with-owner">quit Annapurna Interactive last year</a>, though the new company does not yet have a name.
</p>
<p><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-01-07/ex-annapurna-video-game-staff-to-absorb-former-take-two-label-private-division">Bloomberg reported</a> (paywalled) that this new company would "inherit the games and franchises of Private Division". That presumably includes the works of Roll7 published by Private Division, OlliOlli World and Rollerdrome. It seems plausible that Take-Two pressed a big 'off' switch for those games on Steam, now they don't own them and can't profit from them, before the new Haveli-ex-Annapurna venture could take control of the Steam pages.</p>
<p>The previous games in the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/olliolli">OlliOlli</a> series are still available - they were published under Devlolver Digital. And it's possible the missing games will be relisted once the dust settles. It would be a shame otherwise, considering OlliOlli World was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/olliolli-world-review-so-good-it-will-give-you-blisters">so good it gave me blisters</a>. And Rollerdrome was a similar <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rollerdrome-review">blast of adrenaline</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/fromsoftware-is-%E2%80%98not-chasing-a-trend%E2%80%99-with-elden-ring-nightreign.1098504/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/fromsoftware-is-not-chasing-a-trend-with-elden-ring-nightreign/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>FromSoftware recently explained how Elden Ring Nightreign is not following a trend.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In conversation with <a href="https://www.magazinesdirect.com/az-magazines/6936639/pc-gamer-us-edition-magazine-subscription_.thtml" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PCGamer</a> (via <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/action-rpg/elden-ring-nightreign-went-roguelike-as-the-focus-was-condensing-the-rpg-experience-down-not-because-fromsoftware-was-chasing-a-trend/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GamesRadar</a>), the game director, Junya Ishizaki, revealed how they are treating Elden Ring Nightreign and why it isn’t following a trend. Ishizaki stated that the developers are focusing on “condensing the experience down”, which includes the RPG stuff, the open-world nature, character development, and levelling up. Their plan was for everything to come together and turn into “a boss fight but in a more concentrated form.”</p>



<p>The developers want to integrate a “new sense of accomplishment” not found in Elden Ring or other FromSoftware titles, along with “some new mechanics and some new elements” they can add to the game. They never really insisted on “let’s absolutely not do anything that other companies are doing or not follow any trends”; hence, they didn’t see Elden Ring Nightreign as “chasing a trend” but as elements that will work within their “multiplayer-focused session-based gameplay.”</p>



<p>Elden Ring Nightreign was revealed last year at The Game Awards as a spinoff co-op action-adventure game slated to release in 2025. The game will allow you to play <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/elden-ring-nightreign-solo-or-trio/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">solo or as a trio</a> on a smaller map based on the Limgrave region, with randomised enemies for each playthrough. The title is arriving for Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC via Steam.</p>



<p>In other news, Elden Ring Nightreign’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/elden-ring-nightreign-will-have-a-network-test-starting-february-14/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">network test will be on February 14</a>.

<p>Pokemon TCG Pocket recently released a statement on the Trading Feature, accepting that the restrictions are preventing players from enjoying the game.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Pokemon TCG Pocket’s new post on <a href="https://x.com/PokemonTCGP/status/1885447974094070090" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> discusses why trading features were implemented and the feedback it has received. The developers revealed that the “item requirements and restrictions” have been imposed so that players do not “abuse” the trading feature with bots or “other prohibited actions,” such as using multiple accounts. Their goal with these restrictions has been to provide a fair and balanced environment for the players.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, the Pokemon TCG Pocket developers have admitted that these trading restrictions haven’t hampered the player experience, and hence, they will introduce new changes. After the feedback, the developers are “actively investing ways to improve the feature to address these concerns” Moreover, they plan to introduce more channels for players to obtain trade tokens, “including through event distributions”.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The comments section of this post is filled with players providing their opinions and solutions for Pokemon TCG Pocket’s trading restrictions. Some players have issues with the number of <a href="https://x.com/Lumix_Corrupt/status/1885448532187812345" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">trading tokens required to trade</a>; reducing them should be enough for the feature to be enjoyed. Others have stated they want other restrictions to be removed, too, such as allowing trading <a href="https://x.com/jedi_flodux/status/1885448458300948925" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">between friends and non-friends</a>, trading cards of any rarity, and more.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A leaked set photo (below) has revealed Dinky the T-Rex will be popping up in Fallout's second season. For those unaware, Dinky the T-Rex is a roadside attraction found within Novac, a location in the Mojave Wasteland in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fallout-new-vegas">Fallout: New Vegas</a>.</p>
<p>Here's what the <a href="https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Fallout:_New_Vegas_Official_Game_Guide">Fallout: New Vegas Official Game Guide</a> has to say about Novac and our dinosaur pal:</p>
<p>"Novac is little more than a lonely desert highway motel with multiple buildings that have been fortified for the post-apocalyptic protection of its inhabitable. Watching over them is the landmark of the area: a giant fabricated Tyrannosaurus rex biting off the top of 'The World's 2nd Largest Thermometer'.</p><p>"The interior of 'Dinky' also serves as the city center (a converted gift shop from pre-war times, with a sniper's nest in Dinky's mouth). Dinky is the 'attraction' that drew in tourists. Some of the locals are friendly folk, though most aren't trusting of outsiders."</p>

			<p>The first Final Fantasy VII Rebirth PC patch has gone live today, introducing game stability improvements and more.</p>
<p>The 1.001 patch, which is 17.65 GB big on Steam, improves, as mentioned above, game stability by fixing several unspecified bugs. The patch also fixes the graphics preset to be set to Low when launching the game for the first time on Steam Deck, even when sava data is linked from the cloud, sets DLSS as the default option for anti-aliasing if the NVIDIA upscaler is supported by the system, and updates DirectStorage to the latest version. Sadly, the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2909400/view/518578271369035851?l=english" target="_blank" rel="noopener">patch notes</a> don't mention anything regarding performance improvements, so it may be a while until the issues that many are experiencing are addressed.</p>
<p>While Square Enix works on fixing the PC port of Final Fantasy VII Rebirth, which is a definite step up from the Remake port, though it is still not as good as it should have been, modders are hard at work on improving the game's visuals and introducing <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth-pc-mods-ultrawide-fov/">new features</a>. Several 4K texture packs have already been released to enhance<a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth-mod-greatly-improves-environmental-textures/"> environmental</a> and<a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth-4k-texture-packs-tifa/"> character textures</a>, while some Cheat Engine tables allow players to add <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth-new-mod-addresses-pop-in-playable-sephiroth-zack/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sephiroth and Zack</a> to the party, who both work quite well in combat but are still far from being complete characters, as it is not yet possible to edit their equipment and Materia.</p>
<p>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth is now available on PC and PlayStation 5 worldwide. You can learn more about the game by checking out our <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth/">review</a> of the PS5 version.</p>
