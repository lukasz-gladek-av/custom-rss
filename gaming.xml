            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-scarlet-and-violet-best-selling-japan<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Pokemon Scarlet and Violet&nbsp;</em>have become the series' best-selling games of all time in Japan, beating out the previous record-holder for the first time in decades.</p>

<p>According to a <a href="https://www.famitsu.com/article/202411/24646" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Famitsu report</a> (for which we're using machine translation),&nbsp;<em>Scarlet and Violet&nbsp;</em>have sold over 8.3 million copies between them in Japan, which means they've officially sold more than the original&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Red and Green&nbsp;</em>(since Japan's game was&nbsp;<em>Green&nbsp;</em>rather than&nbsp;<em>Blue</em>).</p>

<p>Until this moment, those original games held the record for Japan's best-selling&nbsp;<em>Pokemon&nbsp;</em>games, and given just how much of a phenomenon&nbsp;<em>Pokemon&nbsp;</em>was when it first arrived, that's no mean feat.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pokemon-scarlet-and-violet-sales-record-coalossal.jpg?itok=klUuspfK 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pokemon-scarlet-and-violet-sales-record-coalossal.jpg?itok=aE4MZqtO 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Pokemon Scarlet and Violet&nbsp;</em>have become the best-selling games in the series in Japan.</figcaption></figure><p>It's worth noting that these sales figures do only apply to Japan, so&nbsp;<em>Scarlet and Violet&nbsp;</em>may well not be the best-selling&nbsp;<em>Pokemon&nbsp;</em>games elsewhere in the world.</p>

<p>However, given the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-has-sold-13936-million-units-super-mario-bros-wonder-sold-1196-million" rel="nofollow">huge success of the Nintendo Switch</a>&nbsp;and the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/palworld-25-million-players-matching-pokemon-scarlet-violet" rel="nofollow">sky-high sales numbers</a> of&nbsp;<em>Scarlet and Violet&nbsp;</em>around the world, I wouldn't be surprised if the newest games were also the best-selling in other regions.</p>

<p>Generally speaking, mainline <i>Pokemon&nbsp;</i>games are released every three years or so, and since&nbsp;<em>Scarlet and Violet&nbsp;</em>launched in 2022, we can perhaps expect an announcement regarding the next major&nbsp;<em>Pokemon&nbsp;</em>games soon.</p>

<p>It's likely, though, that Nintendo will wait until the successor to the Switch is announced. We're expecting news on that front <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-announcement-confirmation" rel="nofollow">sometime before April 2025</a>, so the new&nbsp;<em>Pokemon&nbsp;</em>games may well be revealed alongside the console.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pokemon-scarlet-and-violet-sales-record-venonat.jpg?itok=LgYrtUII 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pokemon-scarlet-and-violet-sales-record-venonat.jpg?itok=cvyror6x 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>New&nbsp;<em>Pokemon&nbsp;</em>games could be announced before the fiscal year is out.</figcaption></figure><p>That announcement seems especially likely to coincide with the Switch 2's given that&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Scarlet and Violet&nbsp;</em>met with criticism at launch regarding their lackluster performance on Switch.</p>

<p>They're not the only games in that particular firing line, either. It seems that devs <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/gamescom-onl-2024-switch" rel="nofollow">may be avoiding releasing games</a> on the Switch owing to its aging internals, so a successor would presumably improve things on that front, not just for&nbsp;<em>Pokemon&nbsp;</em>but across the board.</p>

<p>Still, since it's been confirmed that the Nintendo Switch 2 (or whatever the console ends up being called) <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-successor-will-be-backwards-compatible" rel="nofollow">will be backwards compatible</a>, perhaps there'll be some sort of performance boost for&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Scarlet and Violet&nbsp;</em>on that front. We can but hope.</p>

<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Pokemon Scarlet and Violet&nbsp;</em><a href="https://scarletviolet.pokemon.com/en-gb/buy/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">right now on Nintendo Switch</a>. A DLC pack,&nbsp;<em>The Treasure of Area Zero</em>, which comprises two extra story episodes, is also available now.</p>

<p>Knowing firsthand whether you can run an upcoming simulator is step number one in immersing yourself in the experience wholly. With a game like Microsoft Flight Simulator 2025, the system requirements determine everything, down to your enjoyment of the game. If your computer can’t run the title, you’ll find it a jarring experience that runs the risk of leading to motion sickness. Thankfully, we have the info you need!</p>



<h2 id="h-here-s-the-microsoft-flight-simulator-2024-pc-requirements">Here’s the Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 PC Requirements</h2>



<p>In a simulation game that somehow manages to span the entire planet, albeit in minimal detail in some locations, one would assume the system requirements would be exceptional. They’re pretty high in some spots. Previously, there were rumors that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/microsoft-flight-simulator-2024-on-pc-wants-64gb-ram-to-run-at-its-best/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">MFS 2024 would require 64 GB of RAM</a> to run on the high-end. However, that doesn’t appear to be the case any longer, as the recommended amount of RAM sits at 32 GB currently. </p>



<h3 id="h-minimum-requirements">Minimum Requirements</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>OS</strong>: Windows 10 (64-bit)</li>



<li><strong>Processor</strong>: AMD Ryzen 5 2600X / Intel Core i7-6800K</li>



<li><strong>Graphics</strong>: Radeon RX 5700 / GeForce GTX 970</li>



<li><strong>Memory</strong>: 16 GB RAM</li>



<li><strong>DirectX</strong>: Version 12</li>



<li><strong>Storage</strong>: 50 GB Available Space (SSD Recommended)</li>



<li><strong>Network</strong>: Broadband – Network Speed of 10 Mbps Bandwidth</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-recommended-requirements">Recommended Requirements</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>OS</strong>: Windows 10 (64-bit)</li>



<li><strong>Processor</strong>: AMD Ryzen 7 2700X / Intel Core i7-10700K</li>



<li><strong>Graphics</strong>: Radeon RX 5700 XT / GeForce RTX 2080</li>



<li><strong>Memory</strong>: 32 GB RAM</li>



<li><strong>DirectX</strong>: Version 12</li>



<li><strong>Storage</strong>: 50 GB Available Space (SSD Recommended)</li>



<li><strong>Network</strong>: Broadband – Network Speed of 50 Mbps Bandwidth</li>
</ul>







<h2 id="h-what-platforms-is-microsoft-flight-simulator-2024-releasing-on">What Platforms is Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 Releasing On?</h2>



<p>Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 will be released on November 19 and immediately available to play on PC and Xbox Series X|S. Unfortunately, the flight simulator that spans the globe isn’t coming to PlayStation 5. There’s no word on whether this might change, but with past Microsoft console-exclusive titles, like Grounded and Sea of Thieves, launching on PS5, it’s not outside the realm of possibility.</p>

<p>It’s becoming the norm for an upcoming game to launch with two, three, or sometimes even four unique editions that vary in price and content. The more you spend, the more in-game content you receive. It’s a shame. But if you’re the type of gamer who only plays a handful of titles throughout the year, especially if you have a favorite franchise, paying a little extra for one game makes more sense. Regarding the many airplanes in Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024, paying for the most expensive edition is how you’ll unlock everything at launch.</p>

<p>Firstly, take a look at <a href="https://steamdb.info/sub/633807/depots/">Back 4 Blood's backend on Steam</a>. There you'll see the word "Gobi", which was seemingly the internal codename for Back 4 Blood.</p>
<p>Now take a look at the <a href="https://www.istunt.com/jesse-hutch-4776">online portfolio</a> of motion capture actor and stuntman Jesse Hutch, who includes his performance as a "lead performer" in "Gobi 2". More interestingly still, Hutch <em>also</em> worked on the original Back 4 Blood game. Curiouser and curiouser, right?</p>

<p>Whilst we won't know for sure until Turtle Rock make it official, this - along with the domain back4blood2.com being registered last year - makes the sequel all the more likely. Watch this space, eh?</p>
<p>Back 4 Blood launched back in October 2021 and has received a total of three paid expansions since then. It was generally well-received, with Eurogamer's Chris Tapsell calling it a "delightfully scrappy hang-out shooter" that delivered a successful if "strange mix of old and new" in his <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/back-4-blood-review-weird-but-wonderfully-moreish-horde-shooter">Recommended review</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p>Beastieball was practically made for me, and I can’t thank the creators enough. It comes from Wishes Unltd., who previously released the incredible <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/07/05/chicory-a-colorful-tale-review/">Chicory</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2018/09/27/wandersong-review/">Wandersong</a>, both of which are joys to play, so I’m not shocked to find that Beastieball maintains those good vibes. This time around, it’s all about a world of creature catching, and also… volleyball.</p>
<p><iframe title="Beastieball - Early Access Launch Trailer!" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/oU76fsW2IcE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Basically, you have to try and save land near where you grew up from being overrun and turned into a Beastieball stadium, and to do that, you have to become a Beastieball coach and go on the ultimate tournament arc, constantly pushing yourself and your Beastie’s to new heights, and probably learning some stuff along the way. It’s a very cute idea, and it all gets fought out via volleyball.</p>


<p>Battles are turn-based, and you can do different things depending on if you’re attacking or defending. Each Beastie gets its own special attacks and support abilities, and each one also has its own stats. Different attacks can hit in different directions too, and if you attack a lane or a row where there isn’t an opposing Beastie, then you can win the game outright. You can also throw your attacks at the Beasties to drain their stamina, and when they hit zero stamina they need a nap before they can play again.</p>


<p>None of the Beasties get hurt, which is nice, and the ones you find in the wild will willingly play with you because they actually want to – like when a cat runs at you from across the street meowing to say hello and get some fussing. Plus, if you can show off your skills, they’ll join you as long as you’ve got a spare jersey. It’s just so darn cute, and it’s such a nice change of pace from pitting cute creatures against each other in deathmatches to get badges… or any other very non-specific examples you can think of from the genre.</p>
<p>The character designs are all wonderful, you get to recharge your social battery for cool events as you defeat stronger foes, and you can customise your character as you want. Beastieball is still in Early Access, but it already feels like one of the coolest games I’ve played in ages. It’s just so wonderfully fulfilling, and it makes for a great change to a lot of other games in the genre. Also, we need more volleyball games so I can live out my <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XS-N8KfZ5EU">Haikyuu</a> dreams because I’m almost definitely too old to join a volleyball team.</p>

<p>Beastieball is out now via Steam Early Access. Please play this game and don’t miss out on it.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/payday-3s-dev-team-downsizes-no-layoffs-in-sight-yet/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/payday-3%E2%80%99s-dev-team-downsizes-no-layoffs-in-sight-yet.1038450/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/payday-3s-dev-team-downsizes-no-layoffs-in-sight-yet/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Typically, when a game experiences a rough launch or a development team decides to downsize, it isn't good news. While Starbreeze has downsized the Payday 3 team, it doesn't seem that there are planned layoffs, which, in the current climate of the game industry, is great news. When it comes to games that were highly anticipated and then flopping, Payday 3 is pretty high on the list. Even Starbreeze is aware of the fact that the game launched unsuccessfully. As a result, they've now downsized the team, as reported in <a href="https://www.inderes.dk/releases/starbreeze-ab-publ-interim-report-january-september-2024" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Starbreeze's interim report</a>.</p>
<p>In the report, CEO Mats Juhl states "in the coming months, investment will be lower as we round off 'Operation Medic Bag' for Payday and therefore enter Year 2 with a smaller team focused on continuously updating the game with new content." The report did not specify how downsizing the team will affect Payday exactly and whether it will affect the frequency of updates in Payday 3. This means that <a href="https://wccftech.com/payday-3-will-add-solo-mode-still-requiring-online-connection-soon-alongside-nvidia-dlss-3-support/">the updates</a> will be smaller or less frequent. Despite the fact that the team has downsized and that Payday 3 didn't perform quite to their expectations, the report says that Starbreeze "remains financially strong," which is a good sign for a company in today's climate.</p>
<p>In the report, there was no mention of any layoffs, which is a pretty good sign. Hopefully this means that the staff have been relocated elsewhere within the company, or that they have already landed on their feet. While Payday 3 wasn't quite so successful, Juhl does mention that the recent DLCs that have been released for Payday 3 were well received, providing a glimmer of hope for Starbreeze. Although Payday 3's sales weren't up to scratch, the company's overall revenue has been cushioned nicely by the "relatively stable sales of Payday 2," a game that players found themselves returning to instead of playing Payday 3.</p>
<p>While the report predominantly focuses on the financial updates of the company, and how their current games are performing, there is also mention of Project Baxter, a dungeons &amp; Dragons project that "continues at full speed," with the report going on to state that there are internal playtests taking place, with a lot of "active discussions" happening with a lot of industry-leading companies.</p>
<p>While Starbreeze is known for making the iconic Payday franchise,&nbsp; they have also made games such as Brothers: A Tale of Two Sons and The Chronicles of Riddick: Escape from Butcher Bay. They've also started to dip their toes into publishing, with Dead by Daylight being one of the most well-known titles that they've published.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/kunitsu-gami-path-of-goddess-underperformed</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/capcom-admits-new-ip-kunitsu-gami-path-of-the-goddess-underperformed.1038447/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/kunitsu-gami-path-of-goddess-underperformed<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Capcom has admitted that&nbsp;<em>Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess</em>, an action-tower defense hybrid that also represents a foray into new IP for the studio, underperformed compared to its expectations.</p>

<p>Per <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/capcoms-new-ip-kunitsu-gami-path-of-the-goddess-missed-sales-targets-despite-high-reviews/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Automaton Media</a> (which, in turn, cites a Japanese <a href="https://gamebiz.jp/news/396057" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">GameBiz report</a>),&nbsp;<em>Kunitsu-Gami&nbsp;</em>received strong reviews from both critics and players, but failed to translate those reviews into unit sales.</p>

<p>Capcom blames this deficiency on "insufficient marketing and the failure to generate buzz prior to release", as Automaton says. In essence, not enough was done to let people know what exactly&nbsp;<em>Kunitsu-Gami&nbsp;</em>was before release, and that's never going to help unit sales.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/kunitsu-gami-path-of-the-goddess-capcom-tower-defense.jpg?itok=209PJ2rg 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/kunitsu-gami-path-of-the-goddess-capcom-tower-defense.jpg?itok=zgTImkld 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess&nbsp;</em>didn't sell quite as well as Capcom hoped for.</figcaption></figure><p>The studio certainly isn't wrong when it comes to&nbsp;<em>Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess</em>' critical performance. The game has an 82 critic average on <a href="https://opencritic.com/game/16948/kunitsu-gami-path-of-the-goddess" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">OpenCritic</a>, with 90% of critics recommending it, and it enjoys scores in the 80-85 range across <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/kunitsu-gami-path-of-the-goddess/critic-reviews/?platform=xbox-series-x" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">all</a> three current-gen&nbsp;<a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/kunitsu-gami-path-of-the-goddess/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">platforms</a> on <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/kunitsu-gami-path-of-the-goddess/critic-reviews/?platform=pc" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Metacritic</a> as well.</p>

<p>Users also seem to have broadly positive opinions about the game. It currently has a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2510710/KunitsuGami_Path_of_the_Goddess/#app_reviews_hash" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">91% Very Positive rating on Steam</a> across 1,149 reviews (at time of writing), so it's clear that those who are playing&nbsp;<em>Kunitsu-Gami&nbsp;</em>are enjoying it.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, it's often the case that critically-acclaimed games that exist within a particular niche can't drum up sales.&nbsp;<em>Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess&nbsp;</em>might be a tough sell for a lot of players; it's an action-tower defense hybrid, and it's not easy to see exactly what kind of game it is from screenshots, either.</p>

<p>Still, in the GameBiz report (for which we're using machine translation), Capcom says it intends to continue promoting&nbsp;<em>Kunitsu-Gami&nbsp;</em>in order to achieve its initial sales target, although it wasn't clear about what that target actually is.</p>




<p>Although sales of&nbsp;<em>Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess&nbsp;</em>were apparently lackluster, Capcom says games like&nbsp;<em>Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Ace Attorney Investigations Collection&nbsp;</em>have been selling as expected.</p>

<p>Additionally, the company is currently gearing up for the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-wilds-release-date" rel="nofollow">release of&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Wilds&nbsp;</em>in February</a>, and if its <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-wilds-open-beta-steam-records" rel="nofollow">beta performance</a> is anything to go by, that game is likely to provide a massive boost to Capcom's finances when it's released.</p>

<p>If you'd like to see what&nbsp;<em>Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess&nbsp;</em>is all about, you can check the game out right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2510710/KunitsuGami_Path_of_the_Goddess/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC via Steam</a>, as well as on <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10008719" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a> and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/kunitsu-gami-path-of-the-goddess/9PCWXX0MS15S/0010" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox</a>.</p>

<p>FromSoftware is set to bring back its best-selling Dark Souls game for a new audience. According to a new claim, Dark Souls 3 is getting the remaster treatment from the studio.</p>



<p>The report comes from known leaker “<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/shpeshalnick.xboxera.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Shpeshal Nick</a>” Nick Baker, who made the reveal during the latest episode of his Xbox Era podcast.</p>



<p>“A lot of people will probably file this under ‘this was obvious’,” he said. “What I have heard is that we are getting a Dark Souls 3 remaster.”</p>

<p>Baker hinted that he had more information on the remaster, but wasn’t “allowed to pass that on”. One aspect was regarding resolution and framerate that Nick believes “will be more” than the 1080p 60FPS that the original game features.</p>



<p>First released in 2016, Dark Souls 3 is the best-selling Dark Souls game with over 10 million copies sold. As a franchise, Dark Souls has sold over 35 million units since its debut in September 2011. It also helped fully establish the Souls-like genre that a number of games have utilized in recent years  like the Nioh series, Lords of the Fallen, and more.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/roblox-blocks-under-13s-from-dming-others-outside-games-amid-scrutiny-over-child-protection<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/roblox">Roblox</a> has announced significant changes designed to protect children who play on the platform amid increased scrutiny and concern from parents.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As part of the changes due in the coming months, users under the age of 13 will no longer be able to directly message others on Roblox outside of games or experiences (also known as platform chat).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Roblox will also introduce a built-in setting that limits users under the age of 13 to public broadcast messages only within a game or experience. By default, users younger than 13 will not be able to directly message others. Parents can change this setting in Parental Controls.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">From today, users under the age of nine will only be able to access games or experiences with content labeled Minimal or Mild, with parental consent required to access Moderate content.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Roblox's changes come on the heels both of a <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2024-roblox-pedophile-problem/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>damning Bloomberg report this summer</u></a> about the prevalence of child predators on the platform and, more recently, a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/roblox-accused-of-massively-inflating-user-stats-and-fostering-hellscape-for-children-in-scathing-report"><u>report from investment firm Hindenburg Research</u></a> that accused the company of, among other things, being a haven for groomers and pedophiles due to a lack of up-front screening of new accounts.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It claimed to have found open trading of child pornography on the site as well as violent and hateful speech and sexually explicit content in numerous games marketed to kids on the platform. Roblox responded, saying that "safety and civility" have been "foundational" to Roblox since its inception. However, Hindenburg followed up by pointing out that it had not addressed allegations of Roblox being a "pedophile hellscape."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We’ve spent nearly two decades building strong safety systems, but we know there’s always more to be done,” Matt Kaufman, Chief Safety Officer at Roblox, said in a note to the press issued today.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Last quarter saw a record average for daily active users on Roblox - over 88 million - and as our platform has grown in scale, we have always recognised that our approach to safety must evolve with it. Today’s launch represents the next stage in that evolution. It is the culmination of many months of product development and consultation with online safety experts, and follows the rollout of more than 30 new safety feature enhancements this year alone, as we continue on our mission to build a safe and civil space for play, learning and creativity for millions around the world.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Also from today, accounts with parent privileges will be able to view their child’s screen time over the past week, set daily screen time limits, and view their child’s friends list. In addition, accounts with parent privileges will be able to access existing Roblox tools that allow parents to set spend restrictions, limit or enable certain chat functionality, and determine the type of content their child has access to. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">In the coming months, Roblox will also introduce new restrictions to prevent users under the age of 13 from searching, discovering or playing experiences that have yet to be assigned a Content Label. Restricted content will remain blocked until a user is at least 17 years old and has verified their age by uploading a selfie and a photo of a valid government-issued ID.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Last week, Roblox announced that it will age-gate certain experiences for users under the age of 13, based on the type of user behaviors sometimes found in those experiences. These new restrictions apply to experiences that are primarily designed for socializing with users outside of their friends list and experiences that allow free-form writing or drawing, such as on a chalkboard or a whiteboard.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Back in 2018, <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/roblox-bans-players-who-gang-raped-a-seven-year-olds-avatar" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Roblox faced criticism</u></a> after a mother reported her seven-year-old daughter's Roblox character was violently sexually assaulted by several other characters. Around the same time, a six-year-old girl was <a href="https://metro.co.uk/2018/06/05/girl-6-invited-sex-room-playing-childrens-video-game-roblox-7605376/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>reportedly invited into a "sex room" in the game</u></a>.

There are no blocks to slice or balls to smash, and you don’t need to flail your arms like an octopus in a mosh pit. While other games ask you to zone out and follow along to a pre-set beat, <em>Trombone Champ: Unflattened!</em> lets you wield the most majestic of brass instruments—the trombone, and lets you take control of the music itself. You’re not just reacting to a song like a musical lemming—you’re performing it. Every note, slide, and toot is yours to control, letting you decide whether to stick with the melody or go rogue in Improv Mode with a jazz solo wild enough to have your music teacher reaching for the tissues.</p><p><strong>Campaign Promises</strong></p><p>Our all-new Campaign Mode offers an epic journey packed with surprises for beginners and <em><a title="Games > Trombone Champ [1 article]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/trombone-champ">Trombone Champ</a></em> veterans alike. It eases you in, letting you get comfortable with the instrument’s quirks and rhythm. But don’t get too cozy. The campaign ramps up faster than a trombone glissando, introducing complex tracks and challenges that push your rhythm, timing, and ability to adapt. Every milestone you reach unlocks new tracks, and you’ll leave your mark on the leaderboards as you compete for the illustrious title of the one true <em>Trombone Champ</em>.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p><strong>Hornucopia</strong></p><p>Let’s be honest. One trombone just isn’t enough. How many is too many? We’re not sure yet, but we’re definitely going to find out. At launch, you’ll have over 20 trombones to unlock, each with its own sound, style, and… personality. From a purrfect cat trombone that meows as you play to a ridiculously floppy pool noodle that bends with every slide or even a melting ice cream cone, each trombone has a unique look, sound, and feel. And with dozens more unlockable trombones rolling out in the coming weeks and months, there will always be a new piece of brass to chase after.</p><p>As if that weren’t enough for you relentless collectors, <em>Trombone Champ: Unflattened!</em> also offers a full set of collectible Tromboner Cards. Yes, they’re called Tromboner Cards, and yes, they’re exactly as ridiculous as they sound. With 50 individual cards packed with absurd trombone trivia and mysterious lore, these cards are truly another thing to unlock and collect. Think you’ve got what it takes to snag them all? Just don’t lose your grip on the slide (or your grip on reality) along the way.</p><p><strong>Make It Make Sense</strong></p><p>Thanks to the advanced haptics and adaptive triggers of the PlayStation VR2 Sense controllers, <em>Trombone Champ: Unflattened!</em> lets you feel each note as you play. Whether you’re executing a delicate note or unleashing a full blast, the tactile feedback makes each musical moment feel impactful. Plus, with the game running at a smooth 120 hertz on <a title="Platforms > PS5 [8,379 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps5">PlayStation 5</a> and delivering crisp, vibrant visuals in 4K HDR, every toot and slide looks as impressive as it feels. The dynamic environments and audience reactions adjust to your playing, adding an extra layer of immersion to every performance as you bring the music to life.</p><p><strong>Setting the Stage</strong></p><p>As our debut PlayStation VR2 adaptation, <em>Trombone Champ: Unflattened!</em>, kicks off Flat2VR Studios’ mission to take the classics and give them new life in VR. This is just the beginning for us—we have more in the pipeline, each reimagined to fully leverage the immersive power of VR. We’re thrilled to have PlayStation players join us on this journey as we work to push PlayStation VR2 gaming to new heights.</p></blockquote><p>Watch a new trailer below.</p><h2><span>Release Date Trailer</span></h2><p><iframe title="Trombone Champ: Unflattened! - Announce | PS VR2 Games" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rwmnT8t_3Gw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Today, KOEI TECMO Europe and developer Gust revealed some <a href="https://wccftech.com/atelier-yumia-the-alchemist-of-memories-the-envisioned-land-releases-march-2025/">new details about the upcoming title</a> Atelier Yumia: The Alchemist of Memories &amp; the Envisioned Land. These details give players a glimpse into the combat system of the game and the synthesis feature. For those excited about the game, Atelier Yumia: The Alchemist of Memories &amp; the Envisioned Land is set to release on 21 March 2025 on Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, PC via Steam, Xbox Series X|S, and Xbox One. For the first time ever, players will see the Atelier Yumia franchise on Xbox Series X|S and Xbox One, allowing more platforms than ever to have access to the game.</p>
<p>To celebrate the release of more details about Atelier Yumia: The Alchemist of Memories &amp; the Envisioned Land, KOEI TECMO Europe has released a brand new trailer, which you can watch below. The iconic synthesizing system will be making a return to Atelier Yumia: The Alchemist of Memories &amp; the Envisioned Land, where players will be tasked with manipulating "mana" to be able to create new items that are beneficial to combat or can aid you in exploring the world around you. As you progress through the game, you'll have to learn how to master Resonance Synthesis, which is where you add ingredients that resonate with each other to create a higher-quality item. It does sound like it's going to be a bit of a tricky system, but it also seems like there's room for trial and error and lots of different combinations to try out.</p>

<p>To make sure that the new Atelier experience is fresh, the combat system has been revamped, offering a real-time combat system with intuitive gameplay. In this new Atelier game, skills that are available for active team members now depends on the distance from the enemy, whether they are close or ranged attacks. This is different from previous games in the franchise, as players are now able to move and swap out characters in the team during active combat. There are now also additional combos that can be activated once the correct conditions are met, allowing for combos such as the "Friend Action" or the "Mana Surge."</p>
<p>Also announced are <a href="https://atelier.games/yumia/uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the Premium Box and Special Collection Box</a>, which you can pre-order if you want some extra goodies to celebrate the release of Atelier Yumia: The Alchemist of Memories &amp; the Envisioned Land.</p>
<p>The Premium Box contains the base game, an art book, a B-3 size cloth poster with an original illustration, a CD, and an Early Access costume for Yumia. Alternatively, there is also the Special Collection Box, which includes all of the content from the Premium Box but also contains the following: a handkerchief in the style of the Aladiss Research Team bandana, an A1 tapestry, six keychains, six clear file folders, a sticker sheet, Yumia's stuffed animal and a short story with an accompanying translation booklet.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/half-life-2-steam-player-count-record<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Half-Life 2&nbsp;</em>player numbers on Steam have shot up following an anniversary update released last week, resulting in the game reaching its highest concurrent Steam player count since its release.</p>

<p>A quick look at&nbsp;<em>Half-Life 2</em>'s <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/220/charts/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">SteamDB charts</a>&nbsp;shows that the game managed to reach 64,085 players around 21 hours ago (at time of writing), which is its highest total of all time on the platform.</p>

<p>At time of writing, 45,121 players were still enjoying Gordon Freeman's second major adventure, so&nbsp;<em>Half-Life 2&nbsp;</em>is still riding that wave of renewed popularity. Who knows for how much longer it will last? Let's hope a while, at least.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/half-life-2-player-count-update-ravenholm.jpg?itok=jbFy806S 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/half-life-2-player-count-update-ravenholm.jpg?itok=MNMuVhwb 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Half-Life 2&nbsp;</em>is enjoying a surge of popularity.</figcaption></figure><p><em>Half-Life 2</em>'s surge in popularity comes after the appropriately-named&nbsp;<em>Half-Life 2&nbsp;</em><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/220/view/6633333780228604001" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">20th Anniversary Update</a>, which was released on Friday to coincide with - you guessed it - the game's 20th anniversary.</p>

<p>The update adds both Episode One and Episode Two to the base&nbsp;<em>Half-Life 2&nbsp;</em>game, so if you somehow own&nbsp;<em>Half-Life 2&nbsp;</em>but not its expansions, then you can now enjoy those at no additional cost. They're well worth it!</p>

<p>You'll also now find developer commentaries for the original game included in the Steam package, as well as Steam Workshop support to make modding a little easier. Several visual bugs have been fixed, and new graphics options have been added to "push the visual fidelity of&nbsp;<em>Half-Life 2</em>".</p>

<p>If you want to know how&nbsp;<em>Half-Life 2&nbsp;</em>was made, then you'll also probably find the new documentary, created by the folks behind a similar project for the original&nbsp;<em>Half-Life</em>'s&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/half-life-update-by-valve-available-now-with-steam-deck-support" rel="nofollow">25th anniversary</a>, entertaining and interesting.</p>

The game is currently being given away <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/220/HalfLife_2/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">for free on Steam</a>, with the giveaway running until 10am Pacific today (that's 1pm Eastern). Grab it if you haven't already.</p>

<p>This&nbsp;<em>Half-Life 2&nbsp;</em>update arrives not long after the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/project-white-sands-codename-half-life-rumor" rel="nofollow">discovery of something codenamed&nbsp;</a><em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/project-white-sands-codename-half-life-rumor" rel="nofollow">White Sands</a>&nbsp;</em>once again set off speculation around a new <i>Half-Life&nbsp;</i>game earlier this year.

            <title><![CDATA[Roblox Adds New Parental Controls to Protect Children]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/roblox-children-safety/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/roblox-adds-new-parental-controls-to-protect-children.1038393/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/roblox-children-safety/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Roblox has added new parental controls to its platform to protect children.</p>



<p>Roblox announced the new parental control and safety measures on Monday. The measures aim to give parents and caregivers more control to protect children. Roblox says that some of these changes will be made immediately, starting today, whereas other features will be rolled out next year.</p>



<p>These new features will enable parents to see exactly how long their children are spending on Roblox and view their friends list. They will also enable parents to set a daily limit on the amount of screen time children can have on the platform.</p>



<p>The company also revealed that children under the age of 13 would no longer be able to send direct messages to other users by default unless a parent or guardian changes the setting. Roblox will also launch a slew of new content labels that will make it easier for children and parents to decide what content is age-appropriate. These four new categories will be “minimal,” “mild,” “moderate,” and, “restricted,” which will be the strongest category and could contain “strong violence, heavy realistic blood, moderate crude humor.”</p>



<p>Users under the age of 9 years old can only access “minimal” or “mild” content and will need parental consent for “moderate” content. </p>



<p>You can read the full changes on the <a href="https://corp.roblox.com/newsroom/2024/11/major-updates-to-our-safety-systems-and-parental-controls" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">company’s website here</a>.</p>



<p>Roblox has come under a lot of scrutiny in the past couple of years because it lacks online safety for young children. Earlier this year, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/roblox-gets-banned-in-turkey-over-concerns-of-child-exploitation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Turkey banned the platform because of concerns about child exploitation</a>. A <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/roblox-player-numbers-inflated/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new report in October</a> also revealed that it found the trading of child pornography in some of its games.</p>



<p>What do you think of Roblox’s new safety changes? Let us know in the comments or in the official&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/threads/828/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Forums</a>.</p>

			<p>Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer was <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-handheld-red-line-porting-games/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">featured</a> in several interviews last week. In the second half of the <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/phil-spencer-xbox-indiana-jones-call-of-duty?utm_source=post-email-title&amp;publication_id=66124&amp;post_id=151716114&amp;utm_campaign=email-post-title&amp;isFreemail=true&amp;r=4mhhpq&amp;triedRedirect=true&amp;utm_medium=email" target="_blank" rel="noopener">chat</a> with Game File's Stephen Totilo, published over the weekend, the executive said that he'd rather revisit some of Microsoft's many owned intellectual properties than rely on licensed games any further.</p>
<p><em>I'm not the biggest fan [of making licensed games]. It creates some complexities for us when we think about putting it in a subscription or streaming it. We’ve seen it in racing games that have to get delisted because you lose certain licenses. So I'm always very careful, if we're going to take on a license, that we're doing it for creative reasons, that the team has a goal around what they want to do.</em></p>
<p>Of course, Microsoft does have two big triple-A licensed games in development at Bethesda's MachineGames and Arkane Lyon: Indiana Jones and the Great Circle and <a href="https://wccftech.com/marvels-blade-official-concept-art-shared-by-arkane/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Marvel's Blade</a>, respectively, both of which are IPs owned by Disney. On that partnership, Phil Spencer stated:</p>
<p><em>I feel great about our partnership with Lucas and Disney. They've been good partners. We're obviously doing Blade with Arkane Lyon with them. I was just out there visiting with that team. I think what you see in Indiana Jones is a team that really loves Indiana Jones and that world. The story is, to me, one of the strongest parts of that game—the way you feel like you're Indiana Jones from a first person perspective. So it's clear that's something they wanted to do. But, for us, given the intellectual property that we have that we own. I'm a big fan of us using the IP that we haven't even revisited.</em></p>
<p>It's not hard to understand why Phil Spencer would feel that way: Disney isn't known for licensing its prized IPs cheaply. Moreover, Microsoft really does have access to a boatload of unused intellectual properties, from Rare's beloved Conker and Banjo-Kazooie to Killer Instinct and all the IPs from the latest acquisitions (Bethesda and Activision Blizzard).</p>
<p>Spencer is also known for wearing t-shirts of some of these classic franchises, like Hexen or, more recently, Starcraft, during the Xbox TGS 2024 live broadcast. This gets fans excited about the prospect of reviving those IPs, and today's comments will undoubtedly fuel more chitchat in the respective communities.</p>

"I love my PS5 Pro for the most part, most games look wonderful, but there seems to be an issue with some games," said Chaystic on <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-ps5-pro-has-shimmering-aliasing-issues-in-some-games.1037280/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ResetEra</a>. "There's this weird shimmering, aliasing, whatever you wanna call it. One big example is Black Ops 6, I thought my Pro was faulty or something, but it turns out I'm not the only one who noticed it. I've seen several social media posts who reported the same."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fellow PS5 Pro owners in the comments pointed it out in Spider-Man 2, Stellar Blade, and Alan Wake 2 as well, while <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cb9iM1N9Bz8&amp;t=406s&amp;ab_channel=DigitalFoundry" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Digital Foundry</a> discovered what it called "severe image quality problems" in Star Wars Jedi: Survivor. "There are severe image quality concerns when elements like foliage interact with ray tracing," it said. "The end result is a strobing image quality downgrade that makes this Pro patch difficult to recommend."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The PS5 Pro arrived November 7 as Sony's now standard mid-generation upgrade. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-among-over-50-ps5-pro-enhanced-games-confirmed-by-sony-to-be-ready-for-launch">More than 50 games received PS5 Pro specific patches</a> upon its launch but, as this list includes Alan Wake 2 and Black Ops 6 among others receiving complaints, it's worth proceeding with caution.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/playstation-5-pro-review">In our 7/10 review of the PS5 Pro</a>, IGN said: "The PlayStation 5 Pro is an impressive console with noticeable boosts in performance and graphics for games that take advantage of its powerful hardware. But for $700, you’ll need to think twice about whether or not the upgrade is worth the price tag."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Ryan Dinsdale is an IGN freelance reporter.

"We wanted to take this occasion to clarify that all the rewards available in the Animus Hub will be entirely free."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The post went on to clarify "there are no paid subscriptions or paid battle passes featured in the Animus Hub" and "players will have access to regular content and missions at no extra cost." More details will be revealed closer to the launch of Assassin's Creed Shadows, which <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-to-february-2025">was recently delayed from November to February 14</a>.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Every IGN Assassin's Creed Review</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Ubisoft is also ditching its main paid content model of releasing a Season Pass with two main, paid expansion drops in the year after launch. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-collectors-edition-price-drops-50-amid-cancelled-season-pass-and-early-access">The faux "early access" period</a> that sees publishers charge players more to play on the actual release date instead of three days later has also been scrapped.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Releasing myriad pieces of downloadable content for free will perhaps bring some Assassin's Creed fans back on-side in what's otherwise been a particularly rough pre-launch campaign for Ubisoft.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Issues began as some fans expressed frustration with inaccuracies in the game's depiction of Japan, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-team-issues-apology-to-japanese-fans-for-marketing-that-has-caused-concern">leading the development team to issue an apology</a> and say the game is not intended to be a factual representation of history but instead "a compelling, historical fiction." This despite art director Thierry Dansereau telling IGN that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-inside-ubisofts-ambitious-open-world-japan">Ubisoft looked to make Shadows as "authentic as possible to match historical events"</a> just two months prior.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Concern was also raised when <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-apologizes-to-japanese-historical-re-enactment-group-for-using-its-flag-in-assassins-creed-shadows-art-without-permission">the developer used a flag from a Japanese historical re-enactment group</a> in artwork for Assassin's Creed Shadows without permission. Ubisoft apologized for doing so but refused to remove the artwork from the aforementioned and presumably already printed artbook available in the Collector's Edition. The historical re-enactment group said <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-apology-for-using-historical-re-enactment-group-flag-in-assassins-creed-shadows-not-enough-group-says">this was not good enough</a>, but Ubisoft hasn't publicly acknowledged it since.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Yet another controversy came as <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-figure-removed-from-sale-over-insensitive-design">collectible figure maker PureArts removed an Assassin's Creed Shadows statue from sale</a> over its "insensitive" design.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">All this comes as fans are already frustrated by the delay to the game, which puts Assassin's Creed Shadows in more direct competition with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ghost-of-tsushima-2-confirmed-as-ghost-of-yotei-at-state-of-play-releasing-2025">PlayStation's Ghost of Tsushima sequel, Ghost of Yotei</a>. This is also expected in 2025 and is another open-world action adventure game set in Feudal Japan.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-delay-ghost-of-yotei-ubisoft">Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot maintained confidence</a>, however. "There's a lot of space for very high-quality games, and those two games can sell very well," he said in the company's latest earnings call. "The focus is to really make sure that we deliver a fantastic experience with this dual protagonist approach and two different and complimentary gameplays."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Assassins Creed Shadows indeed features two protagonists, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-brings-back-double-assassinations">stealthy assassin Naoe</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/who-is-yasuke-assassins-creed-shadows-black-samurai-explained">savage samurai Yasuke</a>. The game's story will weave between the two but players can otherwise switch between them at will as they explore Ubisoft's open-world take on Japan.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It will also begin a new modern day story, perhaps linked to the Animus Hub, as <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-will-begin-a-new-modern-day-story-after-the-series-post-desmond-blues">Ubisoft admitted it's "struggled to find its footing" with that aspects of Assassin's Creed</a> in recent years.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Ryan Dinsdale is an IGN freelance reporter.
