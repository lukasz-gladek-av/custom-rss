            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Out of Time is a new multiplayer roguelike third-person action game from developer <a href="https://www.manticoregames.com/">Manticore Games</a> that will launch this coming September 25, 2025, on PC, and will initially be exclusively available on the <a href="https://wccftech.com/civilization-vi-all-dlc-free-on-epic-games-store/">Epic Games Store</a>.</p>



<p>Out of Time puts players in a world where an event called "<em>The Shattering</em>" has ruptured space and time, leaving a final safe haven for people across all timelines called Infinitopia. Outside of Infinitopia's safety, however, you'll be charged with trying to save the remaining members of mankind from threats like dinosaurs, giant mechs, dragons, evil humanoids, mutant crabs, killer robots, and practically everything else that can exist across the entire timeline of the universe. </p>



<p>"<em>With </em><em>Out of Time</em>, we wanted to create a wholly unique and original experience that combines my favourite gameplay mechanics: the best aspects of roguelike, real time multiplayer, and MMO raids," said Jordan Maynard, chief creative officer at Manticore Games, in a press release. "<em>The result is an explosive cocktail of epic combat, infinite replayability, and deep social features, set in the unique context of a universe where time itself has shattered, and past, present, and future collide!</em>"</p>

<p>Out of Time is available to pre-purchase on the Epic Games Store on PC for $24.99 USD, and while Manticore Games is clear on it only initially being an EGS exclusive, it does not say when the game will be heading to Steam. Chief executive officer at Manticore Games, Frederic Descamps, does add that there are plans to bring it to other platforms, he just doesn't specify which ones.</p>



<p>"<em>Manticore’s mission is to create complex immersive multiplayer experiences. We’ve built </em><em>Out of Time</em> as a massively expandable dynamic universe using the Core UGC platform and Unreal. <em>We’re already planning more eras and PvP modes, plus additional platforms."</em></p>

The good news: You and your friends will have an endless supply of gear and weapon combinations to choose from to build your own unique group of survivors. The bad news: All of mankind is trapped and needing to be saved from a gauntlet of dragons, mutant crabs, evil humanoids, warped beasts, killer robots, and everything in between—often all at once. Not to mention the biggest threat of them all—time.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>In <em>Out of Time</em>, the catalyst to the chaos came from an event known as The Shattering, fusing the past, present, and future together into an unpredictable, ever-changing dynamic battleground. Survivors from all eras gather in Infinitopia, the last bastion of civilization, venturing into dangerous, corrupted regions in fast-paced solo or cooperative missions in a fight to reclaim reality.</p><p>Before you give up, don’t fear! The Shattering can taketh, but also giveth! Armed with gear and weaponry from the medieval times to futuristic cyberpunk utopias to prehistoric antediluvian times to post-apocalyptic wastelands and beyond, players will have over 190 million gear combinations to choose from, allowing them to truly create their own custom loadouts for each run. Classes? Where we’re going we don’t need classes. Every player chooses the gear set that best suits the play style they want to embark on every run. If you want to stack a rocket launcher on top of healing powers and tank armor—you do you.</p></blockquote><p>Watch the announcement trailer below.

            <p>
Microsoft has walked back on its previous decision to hike the price of its new first-party Xbox games up to $80 USD this 'holiday season', saying it's sticking to a lower price point "in line with current market conditions".
</p>
<p>
Hints of a pricing rethink first emerged earlier today, when Microsoft first-party studio Obsidian Entertainment revealed its upcoming sci-fi action-RPG <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-outer-worlds">The Outer Worlds</a> 2, which had previously been given an $79.99 price tag, would now cost $69.99.
</p>
<p>
"We have received your SOS via skip drone about the pricing," the studio <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/obsidian.net/post/3lun6okl2us2q">wrote</a>. "As an organisation devoted to making sure that corporations do not go unfettered, we at the Earth Directorate have worked with [REDACTED] to revise the price of The Outer Worlds 2."
</p>
<p>
In a follow-up statement <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/microsoft-concedes-that-the-outer-worlds-2-retail-price-was-too-high">to Windows Central</a>, Microsoft confirmed the pricing adjustment wasn't unique to The Outer Worlds 2. "We're focused on bringing players incredible worlds to explore," an Xbox spokesperson told the publication, "and will keep our full-priced holiday releases, including The Outer Worlds 2, at $69.99." It didn't provide a precise reason for its strategic U-turn, only saying the move was "in line with current market conditions."
</p>
<p>
Xbox was, of course, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/confirmed-xbox-console-prices-are-going-up-worldwide">first major publisher to announced a price increase to $80</a> for "some" of its new first-party games earlier this year, and Nintendo swiftly followed suit, slapping an $80 price tag on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-nintendo-switch-2-the-digital-foundry-hardware-review">Switch 2</a> launch title <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a>. At the time, however, the company stressed it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-responds-to-mario-kart-world-bumper-7580-cost">would be adopting a "variable pricing" system</a> for its new console and, to date, Mario Kart World is the only Switch 2 game to sport that bumper price tag.
</p>
<p>
And no other publisher has yet followed Xbox's bullish lead. Even Take-Two, which has long been rumoured to be <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/will-gta-6-cost-80-report-says-theres-industry-hope-rockstar-will-usher-in-another-game-price-rise">considering an $80 price tag for GTA 6</a>, has remained firm on its variable pricing stance, pointing to its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mafia-the-old-country-is-a-focused-experience-that-doesnt-require-massive-time-commitments-for-45">upcoming $50 Mafia: The Old Country</a>.
</p>
<p>
While some in the industry <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rising-game-prices-would-happen-sooner-or-later-says-former-playstation-exec-shuhei-yoshida">see rising game prices as inevitable</a>, Eurogamer's Chris Tapsell <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/video-games-soaring-prices-have-a-cost-beyond-your-wallet-the-concept-of-ownership-itself">took at look at the phenomenon earlier this year</a>, noting that soaring prices have a cost beyond buyers' wallet - the concept of ownership itself.

            <link>https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/mouse-work-gets-second-trailer-but-cant-release-until-creators-get-switch-2-dev-kit</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/mouse-work-gets-second-trailer-but-cant-release-until-creators-get-switch-2-dev-kit.1251204/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>

<p>Nitrome's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mouse-work">Mouse Work</a> made a bit of a splash when it was revealed back around the Switch 2's launch, looking very much, as it does, a sort of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/snipperclips_plus_cut_it_out_together">Snipperclips</a> for Switch 2 that utilises the console's neat mouse mode function.</p>
<p>Now, Nitrome has released a second trailer for their mouse-mode-centric effort, alongside a bunch of new info about the ins and outs of what you'll be doing as you play- when you do actually get to play, that is.</p>
<p>The new trailer takes us through three job types, and shows off the game's Job Centre. The jobs detailed are Hairdresser, Archer and Tour Guide, so this is definitely already a much more interesting job centre than the ones this writer remembers being harrowed by during the late 1990s.</p>

<p>We'll let Nitrome's press release fill you in on a little more of the finer points:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>In Hairdresser, you’ll work against the clock to give your hirsute customers the trim of their dreams. Click with your scissors to cut away at their hair, or use the razor to give them a close shave - and we couldn’t not add tweezers, right?</p><p>

Next up is Archer, where your aim will be put to the test. Hit all the targets as they fly past (quack), and don’t miss any, or else you’ll lose a life! Be sure not to hit your coworkers, too...</p></div>
<p>Tour Guide takes a fresh spin on a Nitrome classic - Hot Air! Propel your tourist through the stage to reach the goal, but be sure to visit landmarks along the way to take in the view and earn your tip. We’ve worked hard to ensure Tour Guide stays true to its roots (it was even programmed by one of the Hot Air series’ developers!)</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p><br>
You can check out the trailer above for yourself, it's certainly looking like a whole bunch of fun, and this new glimpse also makes sure to highlight some important changes to the game's multiplayer.</p>
<p>"In Cargo Hauler, some crates will simply be too heavy to lift by a single mouse, or in IT Support, some popups will trap a player inside them - you’ll need a colleague to come over and close that popup before you can escape!"</p>
<p>Now, and on a slightly frustrating note, Nitrome, whilst fully ready to release by the looks and sounds of it, will have to wait to announce a release date for all this mouse-drive mayhem, as they have yet to receive a Switch 2 dev kit from the Big N.</p>
<div><p>As we reported on a while back, it seems that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/nintendo-prioritising-switch-2-dev-kits-for-indies-needing-extra-oomph-say-devs">this is par for the course at this stage of a new console launch</a>, with indies that require extra grunt perhaps getting kits first. It still feels a bit odd that Nintendo aren't keen to make sure these sorts of titles, which big-up the new features of a new console, are first in line for kits, mind.</p><p>

As Nitrome puts it:</p></div>
<blockquote>
<p>Mouse Work’s release is dependant on Nitrome acquiring dev kits for Switch 2 which we do not yet have. That being said, we are working away to get Mouse Work as ready as possible so that when we do have one, we can release as soon as we can!<em><br></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>We'll leave you with some fresh screenshots!</p>


<hr>
<p><em>Looking forward to getting some new job experience when Mouse Work manages to release? Like the look of what you've seen of the game thus far? Make sure to let us know in the comments!</em></p>

<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/OuterWorlds/status/1948020672502137257" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on social media, Xbox and developer Obsidian say that as part of "making sure that corporations do not go unfettered" (a tongue-in-cheek reference to the game's satirical anti-corporate message), the price of&nbsp;<em>The Outer Worlds 2&nbsp;</em>will be lowered from $80 to $70.</p>

<p>Additionally, Xbox confirmed to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-u-turns-on-the-outer-worlds-2-80-price-point-reverting-to-70-and-reimbursing-pre-order-customers" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">IGN</a>&nbsp;that this pricing change applies not only to&nbsp;<em>The Outer Worlds 2</em>, but also to all Xbox holiday releases, so that includes the upcoming&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</em>. Xbox is also releasing&nbsp;<em>Ninja Gaiden 4&nbsp;</em>this holiday, but that game was already set at $70.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-70-xbox.jpg?itok=IQJV6pAY 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-70-xbox.jpg?itok=rLvqptb- 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7&nbsp;</em>will also cost you "just" $70 when it launches this holiday.</figcaption></figure><p>In its statement to IGN, Microsoft says it's keeping the prices at $70 "in line with current market conditions", so although this may be true for 2025's holiday season, it may not hold for next year.</p>

<p>If you missed it, Xbox made the announcement that it would <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xbox-prices-raised-hardware-software" rel="nofollow">raise hardware and software prices back in May</a>, with its two major holiday releases (<em>The Outer Worlds 2&nbsp;</em>and<i>&nbsp;Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</i>) serving as the first $80 games from Microsoft.</p>

<p>That announcement was, of course, met with exactly the same hostility and criticism with which Nintendo was met when it announced that&nbsp;<em>Mario Kart World&nbsp;</em>would cost the same, although Nintendo hasn't climbed down on its pricing structure.</p>

<p>Xbox is, however, in a different position to Nintendo. Thanks to a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/latest-microsoft-layoff-wave-king-zenimax" rel="nofollow">recent massive wave of layoffs</a> at Microsoft, which saw in-development projects like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/everwild-canceled-rare-layoffs-report" rel="nofollow">Rare's&nbsp;</a><em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/everwild-canceled-rare-layoffs-report" rel="nofollow">Everwild</a>&nbsp;</em>and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/perfect-dark-reboot-canceled-developer-shut-down" rel="nofollow">The Initiative's&nbsp;</a><em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/perfect-dark-reboot-canceled-developer-shut-down" rel="nofollow">Perfect Dark</a>&nbsp;</em>canceled (as well as the latter shutting its doors for good), Xbox is arguably in need of some goodwill right now.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/rare-everwild-canceled-xbox-outer-worlds-2.jpg?itok=xfYxg1Do 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/rare-everwild-canceled-xbox-outer-worlds-2.jpg?itok=n_Im1s8v 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Xbox is arguably hurting for goodwill given its recent wave of layoffs and cancellations.</figcaption></figure><p>For now, though, we can take solace in the fact that we won't be paying $80 for&nbsp;<em>The Outer Worlds 2&nbsp;</em>or&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</em>&nbsp;this holiday season. It's worth bearing in mind that both games are also available on Game Pass on day one, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xbox-game-pass-price-hike-new-tier" rel="nofollow">if you're a PC- or Ultimate-tier member</a>.</p>

Andrew joined The Verge in 2012, writing over 4,000 stories.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>We already knew that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/685162/nintendo-switch-2-sales-figures-record">Nintendo got off to a strong start with the Switch 2’s launch</a>, and now that the console has been out for a bit, we’re getting a clearer picture on exactly how it performed. According to market research firm Circana, Nintendo’s new console “debuted as the fastest selling video game hardware device in US history,” selling 1.6 million units in June. That topped the previous launch month record held by the PS4, which moved 1.1 million units in November of 2023.</p><p>Unsurprisingly, Circana says that the Switch 2 was the best-selling console in the US in June overall, in terms of both units sold and dollars raked in. And overall the launch buoyed what the firm says is “a record high for hardware spending” in the month of June at $978 million. The previous record was $608 million in 2008.</p><p>As for games, it should come as no surprise that most Switch 2 owners also picked up a copy of <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/games-review/684518/mario-kart-world-review-nintendo-switch-2">Mario Kart World</a></em>, which was the only major first-party exclusive for the console until <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/games-review/707704/donkey-kong-bananza-review-nintendo-switch-2">Donkey Kong Bananza</a></em> launched earlier this month. According to Circana, a whopping 82 percent of those who bought a Switch 2 also got a copy of <em>World</em>, either via a console bundle or buying a physical copy of the game. And in terms of accessories, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/684602/nintendo-switch-2-pro-controller-review">the Switch 2 Pro Controller</a> had a 32 percent attach rate, according to the research firm.</p><div><p>Of course, the initial excitement around the Switch 2’s launch <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/677301/the-switch-2s-promising-start-hides-an-uncertain-future">suggested it would get off to a strong start</a>. The challenge will be to keep that momentum going, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/708909/nintendo-switch-2-donkey-kong-bananza-exclusive-release-schedule">something Nintendo is attempting to do by pacing out its game releases</a>. While <em>World</em> and <em>Bananza</em> are out now, the rest of the year includes the likes of <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/711445/pokemon-legends-z-a-nintendo-switch-2-bundle-trailer">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a></em>, <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/641602/kirby-air-riders-switch-2-masahiro-sakurai">Kirby Air Riders</a></em>, and <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/640231/metroid-prime-4-nintendo-switch-2-enhanced-edition-beyond">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a></em>.</p></div><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTk3"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Andrew Webster</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><div><form><div><h2>The Verge Daily</h2><p><span>A free daily digest of the news that matters most.</span></p></div></form></div></div></article></main></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/712362/nintendo-switch-2-june-2025-sales]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Microsoft have done a U-turn and decided they don't fancy making a series that at least tries to satirise capitalism the face of a price hike. In the US, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-outer-worlds-2">The Outer Worlds 2</a> will no longer cost $79.99, but the low, low sum of $69.99 instead.</p>
<p>For UK folks, that means a tenner's been knocked off what you'll pay to pre order the standard version of the RPG, which <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-outer-worlds-2-gets-a-release-date">comes out on October 29th</a>. Xbox and co will be doing the same with their other holiday period games this year, rather than pushing up how much folks are paying to £70/$80.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Yep, <a href="https://www.obsidian.net/news/obsidian/the-outer-worlds-2-price-change">this about face</a> has seen The Outer Worlds 2's pre order price <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1449110/The_Outer_Worlds_2/">on Steam</a> knocked down from £69.99 to £59.99, the same price as fellow Obsidian role-playing thing <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/avowed">Avowed</a>. The premium edition'll still cost you £89.99, though.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-u-turns-on-the-outer-worlds-2-80-price-point-reverting-to-70-and-reimbursing-pre-order-customers">IGN</a> reports folks who've already pre-ordered the game for the higher price will be able to claim refunds from whichever storefront or location they bought it from, and Xbox says these might take a few days to come through.</p> <div>

<p>In their continued efforts to make me feel mildly embarrassed about having liked the first Outer Worlds and being at least curious to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/heres-11-thoroughly-whelming-minutes-of-the-outer-worlds-2">give the sequel a go</a>, Microsoft announced this price change with not one but two meme posts to the series' official Musk platform account.</p>
<p>"We have received your SOS via skip drone about the pricing," read the first one. "As an organisation devoted to making sure that corporations do not go unfettered, we at the Earth Directorate have worked with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/redacted">[REDACTED]</a> to revise the price of The Outer Worlds 2. While this will not bring peace to the galaxy, or even your local colony, we assure you all that we are here to fight for all colonies in every way that we can."</p>
<p>Ok, bit cringe maybe, but I can deal with it and...oh no. They almost immediately posted a <a href="https://x.com/OuterWorlds/status/1948025734888599847">second highly-edited corporate meme clip</a> of someone punching a Spacers' Choice moon mascot with the price plastered over its face. Look, I get that the devs probably weren't fans of the price increase either, given it might well have meant fewer folks buying their game, but maybe don't try to play this off as some grand victory. It's some execs going 'harrummph' and putting their tails between their legs for now.</p>
<p>Some execs, I have to point out, who oversaw <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-layoffs-are-reportedly-underway-with-zenimax-and-king-employees-losing-their-jobs">mass layoffs</a> earlier this month.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-u-turn-on-charging-80-for-the-outer-worlds-2-and-other-xbox-games-cue-memes-and-pre-order-refunds]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Microsoft is backtracking on a shift to charging $80 for their games, with Obsidian confirming that <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/the-outer-worlds-2">The Outer Worlds 2</a> will now be priced at $70 – alright,&nbsp;<em>fine,</em> it’s technically $69.99 – when it launches this October.</p>
<p><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/obsidian.net/post/3lun6okl2us2q">Obsidian got to make the announcement</a> in suitably silly fashion, given the franchise:</p>


<p>We have received your SOS via skip drone about the pricing. As an organization devoted to making sure that corporations do not go unfettered, we at the Earth Directorate have worked with [REDACTED] to revise the price of The Outer Worlds 2.</p>
<p>While this will not bring peace to the galaxy, or even your local colony, we assure you all that we are here to fight for all colonies in every way that we can.</p>
<p>From the Office of the Director of the Earth Directorate</p>

<p>In a statement to <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/microsoft-concedes-that-the-outer-worlds-2-retail-price-was-too-high">Windows Central</a>, an Xbox spokesperson said, “We’re focused on bringing players incredible worlds to explore, and will keep our full priced holiday releases, including The Outer Worlds 2, at $69.99 – in line with current market conditions.”</p>
<p>Refunds for pre-orders will have to be requested manually, depending on the retailer, and the new pricing is rolling out today or tomorrow.</p>
<p>Those market conditions were probably everybody telling them that $80 for a new game sucks, both in the form of comments across social media and forums, and most likely in the form of the number of pre-orders that Microsoft were seeing. While The Outer Worlds 2 will launch on Game Pass for Xbox and PC, which naturally affects the number of people paying full price on console in particular, the higher price would be felt when looking at pre-orders across Steam and PlayStation 5.</p>
<p>Of course, this is bigger than just The Outer Worlds 2, and it was expected that <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/call-of-duty-black-ops-7">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</a> would follow suit this year, before Fable, Gears of War E-Day and other major launches in 2026. Black Ops 7 pre-orders aren’t live yet, but if The Outer Worlds 2’s pre-orders were bad enough, there would have been some execs and accountants with a case of the nervous bouncy leg, especially when they already sacrificed a huge amount of day one revenue last year by putting Black Ops 6 on Game Pass.</p>
<p>We’ll have to wait and see if Microsoft is just delaying the price bump until January, or if they hold off a while longer.</p>

			<p>If you follow the video game industry at all, then unless you've been living under a rock for the month of July, you've heard about <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-mass-gaming-layoffs-have-begun/">Microsoft enacting its latest mass layoff</a>, which cut 9,000+ people across the company, a large chunk of those cuts hitting its Xbox and gaming division. It was an awful way to start the month, as we learned, and are still learning, how those cuts impacted studios like <a href="https://wccftech.com/perfect-dark-cancelled-the-initiative-shut-down-microsoft-layoffs/">The Initiative</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/zenimax-online-new-mmorpg-canceled/">ZeniMax Online</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/rare-everwild-cancelled-microsoft-gaming-layoffs/">Rare</a>, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/candy-crush-microsoft-laid-off-developers-being-replaced-by-ai-tools-they-built/">King</a>, to name a few.</p>



<p>In an interview with <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/zenimax-staff-lambast-inhumane-xbox-layoffs-it-s-difficult-to-work-when-you-re-looking-at-a-graveyard-">Game Developer</a>, several ZeniMax Media developers, some of whom are still with the studio and others who were impacted in the layoffs, called out Microsoft and Xbox executive leadership for how poorly the mass layoff was handled, the chaos it caused, and the execution of the whole situation, which some called "<em>inhumane</em>" and "<em>disgusting</em>."</p>



<p>One former employee described to Game Developer how they were booted out of their work email, Slack, everything, without any proper notice that they'd been laid off, and were left for hours without any communication from Microsoft. Member of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/zenimax-workers-united-qa-union-haved-reached-a-tentative-deal-with-microsoft-the-first-deal-reached/">ZWU-CWA</a> union, Page Branson, said the lack of any process to the layoffs left people "<em>distraught and confused and not knowing if they would have a job by the end of the day, or even if the layoffs were done by the end of the day</em>." </p>



<p>When Branson and others started to get a better picture of who was impacted and who wasn't, Branson said that some of those who were cut were "<em>absolutely crucial</em>" and "<em>integral</em>" members of staff, specifically for The Elder Scrolls Online. Autumn Mitchell, a senior QA developer and also a member of the ZWU-CWA union, added, "<em>It's not okay. It wasn't normal. I don't care how many times they do it to try and make it seem normal—it's not. The way they do it is inhumane. I don't care how much they say that it's dignified or they want to do it in a respectful way—it's not."</em></p>



<p>"<em>Some people were here for 15 years and cut out. Making it so that people have to rush to type a goodbye message into Slack to their colleagues that they've been working with on various projects, that have been making your corporation money for 15 years, is disgusting. It's disgusting. If I could get any message to any executive right now it would be review this process because it's not normal and it's not okay."</em></p>



<p>Branson also spoke about what is perhaps the most significant long-term impact of mass layoffs like this: the sudden disappearance of institutional knowledge that developers who had been working at the studio for years had. "<em>A lot of practical knowledge just disappeared overnight</em>. <em>Everyone left now has to pick up the pieces as best they can. The [dwindling] morale and general confusion of it all has extended into our general workflow. We used to have very, very reliable people working on things and they're no longer there. They were integral. I feel like they were numbers on a sheet that got cut, but the real application of what they were doing was integral to making everything run correctly.</em>"</p>



<p>Mitchell added that they estimated a third of ZeniMax Media's institutional knowledge is now gone thanks to the layoffs, and that they "<em>don't really know</em>" how those left standing are supposed to continue making games at the same quality they did before. They also added that they don't see how moving forward in some cases is even possible without critical members of the team who were impacted in the layoffs getting brought back.</p>



<p>Every story from the Microsoft layoffs is upsetting, and these details only compound the sadness for the developers and the frustration towards Microsoft and Xbox leadership for their carelessness in how things were handled. The short-term financial benefit that comes with having fewer people on the payroll only digs a deeper debt when it comes to the lack of experiential knowledge left behind, and the inability to properly train and mentor a new class of workers to take the place of the developers who players praise for creating the games we love in the first place. </p>



<p>These kinds of cuts, and the careless ways in which they're handled, are what make it difficult to see any real future for Xbox and Microsoft in the video game industry beyond that of a third-party publishing house. And even then, it's worth asking why anyone in the video game industry should place their trust in Microsoft, if the company is going to cut whatever it wants to cut, <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-layoffs-funding-increased-spending-ai-infrastructure/">just to chase the latest trends in tech</a>.</p>

The <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rat-king-has-eaten-my-lunch-and-now-its-going-to-eat-yours">Rat King</a> is dead, long live the Fool King. In this medieval roguelite autobattler, you must murder a skeleton monarch with dice. You will do this not by loading bags of D20s into a culverin and shooting the Fool King point blank, though yes, that sounds like an amazing lategame unlock. Instead, you will be rolling the dice to determine how many knights, peasants, wizards and crossbowmen you can summon to each battlefield. I've been playing the prototype, and while roguelites are thick as wheat these days, this is a promising contender. Here's a trailer.

<p>
Let me walk you through it. First, you pick three dice corresponding to unit type. Then, you roll them to decide how many of each unit you can conjure. You get to re-roll selected dice exactly once before committing. Then, you line them all up facing the enemy army using drop-and-drag controls. Then, you bellow CHARGE at your computer (while pressing the "fight" button) and look on indolently as they sword, fireball and arrow each other to bits. This was exactly how Richard the Lionheart did it during the siege of Castillon-sur-Agen, except he had to imagine the fireballs.
</p>
<p>
Whether you win or lose, you'll earn coin from the engagement with which to customise your units. Maybe a passive for your knights that electrifies attackers? Maybe some poison for your crossbows? You can also add pips to your die faces, and buy new dice to increase the number of formations in play. The basic roguelite tuggowar here is whether to enhance the units you have, or increase your army's headcount so that you aren't outflanked and surrounded.
</p>
<p>
The autobattling bits seem rudimentary by the standards of, say, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mechabellum">Mechabellum</a>, but it's early days for the Fool King, with no release date in sight. Possibly the neatest feature is the asynchronous multiplayer. As developers Loot Donkey explain on <a href="https://lootdonkey.itch.io/fool-king">the Itch.io page</a> (where you'll find the downloadable prototype), "your ghost data and choices are recorded so that you will be facing real player decisions and may even have to battle your past self in a future run." My past self? I farking hate that guy. Fetch me my culverin and don't spare the D20s.

We now know it’s the fastest-selling console launch in the U.S. ever. But the Switch 2 wasn’t the only thing interesting about June 2025's video game sales numbers. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197565" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Nintendo Switch 2 Could Launch With Almost No Reviews" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="122" data-playlist="197565,197567,196165" data-current="197565"><div><p>Nintendo Switch 2 Could Launch With Almost No Reviews</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197565/197565_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197565/197565_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197565/197565_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/23089.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Research group Circana released its monthly figures on Wednesday, with director Mat Piscatella sharing charts and data in an <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3lun37i6gok2k&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3lun37i6gok2k" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">extended thread on Bluesky</a></span>. The Switch 2 sold 1.6 million units in the U.S. alone in June and almost all of those buyers were also playing <em>Mario Kart World</em>. According to Circana, 82 percent of all Switch 2 owners in the country also purchased Nintendo’s new racer, either as a physical copy or through the digital pack-in bundle. The data doesn’t track digital sales of the game, which suggests the real number of<em> Mario Kart World</em> players on Switch 2 is even higher. </p><p>Here are the top-20 best-selling games overall in June 2025:</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><ol data-type="List" data-style="Number"><li><em>Elden Ring: Nightreign</em></li><li><em>Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</em></li><li><em>Mario Kart World</em></li><li><em>Cal of Duty: Black Ops 6</em></li><li><em>Stellar Blade</em></li><li><em>Forza Horizon 5</em></li><li><em>MLB: The Show 25</em></li><li><em>Minecraft </em></li><li><em>Grand Theft Auto 5</em></li><li><em>Rune Factory: Guardians of Azuma</em></li><li><em>Split Fiction</em></li><li><em>EA Sports FC 25</em></li><li><em>Elden Ring</em></li><li><em>NBA 2K25</em></li><li><em>Red Dead Redemption II</em></li><li><em>The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered</em></li><li><em>Star Wars: Battlefront II</em></li><li><em>Cyberpunk 2077</em></li><li><em>Assassin’s Creed: Shadows</em></li><li><em>WWE 2K25</em></li></ol></blockquote><p>Circana also shares a list of the best-selling games on each individual platform but doesn’t break them out between Switch 2 and the older hardware. Instead, both consoles are rolled up into a single “Nintendo platforms” list, at least for now. That makes it hard to get a clear sense of what Switch 2 owners specifically are buying and playing, but not surprisingly the list is dominated by new Switch 2 games and older games that received upgrades like <em>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</em>. Notable Switch 2 releases that didn’t chart include <em>Hitman: World of Assassination </em>and <em>Yakuza 0</em> <em>Director’s Cut</em>. Here are some other interesting takeaways from the data.</p><h2 id="h549916"><a id=""></a><em>Elden Ring: Nightreign</em> is still topping the charts</h2><p>FromSoftware’s multiplayer spin-off is now the best-selling game for two months in a row. That’s especially notable given it’s only $40 and Circana tracks sales by revenue, meaning it’s pulling double duty compared to full-priced games like <em>Mario Kart World</em>. Interestingly, it’s still only the eighth overall best-selling game year-to-date, but it’s clearly pushed lots of players who apparently hadn’t already purchased<em> Elden Ring</em> to go back and play it, bringing its predecessor back into the top 2o for the month. </p><h2 id="h549917"><a id=""></a><em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em> has completely dropped off</h2><p>Despite being the best-selling game for 2025 overall so far, <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em> hasn’t charted in either of the last two months. That could suggest some momentum has died down as players bounce off with the lack of post-game content and rapid updates, and/or that PC performance has really stopped the game dead in its tracks on the platform where it was selling the best. It’s still sitting at “overwhelmingly negative” in its recent Steam reviews and the concurrent player count has fallen off more quickly than it did with <em>Worlds</em>. </p><h2 id="h549918"><a id=""></a>Fans can’t get enough of the Switch 2 Pro controller</h2><p>Nintendo’s conventional alternative to the Joy-Con was June’s best-selling gaming accessory. Around 32 percent of Switch 2 owners also picked one up, a number that likely would have been higher if the controller hadn’t kept selling out everywhere. Some fans have called it <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/Switch/comments/1l5dk80/is_the_switch_2_pro_controller_worth_it/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Switch/comments/1l5dk80/is_the_switch_2_pro_controller_worth_it/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the best controller ever made</a></span>, but its popularity also probably speaks to just how many people play their Switch 2 docked and are tired of compromising that living room experience with sub-par Joy-Con controllers, even the upgraded ones for the Switch 2. </p><h2 id="h549919"><a id=""></a><em>Rune Factory: Guardians of Azuma</em> was a surprise hit </h2><p>The long-running RPG life sim series that started on the DS was a console exclusive on Switch 1 and 2 last month (it also came to PC) and ended up making the top 1o. It’s hard to know how many of those players were on Switch 2, but the game was the third best-selling across both Nintendo platforms, just behind <em>Cyberpunk 2077 </em>and ahead of <em>Breath of the Wild</em> and <em>Tears of the Kingdom</em>. I preferred<em> Fantasy Life i </em>myself, but it shows how Nintendo continues to benefit from rolling handheld and console-like experiences into a single device. </p><h2 id="h549920"><a id=""></a>It’s the summer of <em>Elder Scrolls Online</em> on Xbox</h2><p>We hear a lot about<em> World of Warcraft</em> and<em> Final Fantasy XIV</em>, but much less about Bethesda’s ongoing MMORPG which just crossed its 11th year out in the wild. It was the second best-selling game on Xbox Series X/S and Xbox One last month. A big part of that is probably <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.elderscrollsonline.com/en-us/news/post/68093&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.elderscrollsonline.com/en-us/news/post/68093" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a major update and new seasonal storylines</a></span> that went live for the game in June, but another factor is probably the release of <em>Oblivion Remastered</em> earlier in the year and returning fans looking for more reasons to hang around in Tamriel.<em> ESO</em> was the second best-selling game on the platform last month as well. </p><p>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/switch-2-sales-mario-kart-world-elden-ring-nightreign-1851786793]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Julian LeFay, widely regarded as "the father of The Elder Scrolls", has passed away at the age of 59, following what his studio described as a "courageous battle with cancer." His death was <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/oncelostgames/the-wayward-realms/posts/4441113" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">confirmed by OnceLost Games</a>, the studio he co-founded, which called his passing "an immeasurable loss for our team, our community, and our industry."</p><p>According to CEO Ted Peterson, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/father-of-elder-scrolls-stepping-away-from-industry-due-to-ailing-health/1100-6533230/" data-ref-id="1100-6533230">LeFay stepped away from work just a week before his death</a>, choosing to spend his final days surrounded by family. Despite his illness, he remained actively involved in development, continuing to guide the team, mentor younger developers, and help shape The Wayward Realms to reflect his signature design philosophy and creative ambition.</p><p>Lefay was a key figure behind The Elder Scrolls: Arena and Daggerfall, two titles that laid the foundation for one of the most influential franchises in gaming history. His legacy was so deeply embedded in the series that the in-game deity Julianos was named in his honor. In 2019, LeFay teamed up with fellow former Bethesda developers Ted Peterson and Vijay Lakshman to establish OnceLost Games, announcing their ambitious new RPG, The Wayward Realms, in 2021.</p><p>OnceLost Games affirmed that work on the game will continue in LeFay's honor, stating that the team is dedicated to realizing the vision he helped build. "Julian's influence extends far beyond our studio," the statement reads. "He touched the lives of millions of players worldwide and inspired countless developers to push creative boundaries. His legacy will live on in every realm, quest, and moment of wonder players experience in The Wayward Realms."</p><p>The statement goes on to say that while "this is an immeasurable loss for our team, our community, and our industry," development on the game will continue. The team is committed to honoring LeFay’s legacy by bringing his vision to life.</p><p>The tribute concludes: "Julian's impact reaches far beyond our studio. He touched millions of players worldwide and inspired generations of developers to push creative boundaries. His legacy will live on in every realm, quest, and moment of wonder in The Wayward Realms."</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/tom-clancys-rainbow-six-siege">Rainbow Six Siege</a> has seemingly underperformed, according to a recent <a href="https://staticctf.ubisoft.com/8aefmxkxpxwl/5wMXD5U7aP5imdxB186rmg/d3ffd32ed3c2821d7e89d3c48d0ade35/Ubisoft_FY26_Q1_Sales_EN_vf.pdf">Ubisoft quarterly financial report</a>. This is blamed on a "pricing exploit" allowing players to inflate in-game wallets with more currency than they should have had.</p>
<p>Overall, the company has earned 2.2 percent less than it did this time last year. This drop was blamed on issues tied to Rainbow Six Siege X's launch, "unfavourable exchange rates", and the aforementioned pricing exploit.</p>
<p>Players were able to use pre-paid currency cards to buy more in-game currency than intended, allowing them to buy more items in-game than Ubisoft intended. This exploit has now been fixed. </p>

<p>Ubisoft president Yves Guillemot stated: "Rainbow Six Siege X received highly positive player feedback thanks to its renewed gameplay and enhanced features that drove significant player engagement growth."</p>
<p>Guillemot continued: "However, player spending in Rainbow Six Siege faced temporary but significant disruptions due to technical pricing issues, which have now been identified and addressed. Despite this one-off setback, the growth potential of the game is strong with solid traction on activity and in-game spending."</p>
<p>In contrast, Guillemot stated <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-codename-red">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> has performed exceptionally well, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-coming-to-switch-2-ubisoft-hints">pushing past five million players since its release</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Developer Sloclap has released its first major patch for Rematch (a bit of unexpected poetry, there).</p>
<p>While this patch <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rematch-crossplay-top-priority-future-updates">doesn't add the likes of crossplay</a>, though "good progress" is being made, it does address a swathe of other fixes and improvements for Rematch, which the team has been working on since the last hotfix.</p>
<p>One major change coming with this patch is gamepad remapping, with the developer admitting while this first version is "quite basic", soon it will offer a more advanced version for players to tinker with.</p>

<p>Rematch's first major patch also includes fixes to the camera during goal replays, with Sloclap saying the jitter has been removed. Animations, meanwhile, have received a bit of polish, while the studio has also fixed an issue where goalkeepers were not reacting to opponents' collisions. The team has additionally made "multiple" environment and lighting improvements and fixes.</p>
<p>On the Menus and Interface side of things, Sloclap has added a Colourblind Mode. When this is activated, it will change the colour selection for teams according to deuteranopia, protanopia or tritanopia (the three main types of colour blindness). For now, this mode appears to be the start of a work in progress, with the developer saying the "feature will be pushed further" in a future patch, to apply the filter to the entire screen.</p>
<p>There are still some known issues with Rematch, which Sloclap has acknowledged. These include the ball on occasion emitting "loud wind sounds" until it gets kicked, which honestly sounds to me more like a feature than a bug.</p>
<p>The next patch is expected in the next two to three weeks, Sloclap has said. In the meantime, you can find <a href="https://www.playrematch.com/post/patch-1-1-200-100">further information on Rematch's first major patch here</a>.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rematch-kicks-off-first-week-with-impressive-sales-and-player-milestones">Rematch surpassed 1m sales in its first week on the market</a>, with three million "unique" players also joining the pitch thanks to its inclusion on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-our-next-batch-of-xbox-game-pass-titles-for-june">Xbox's Game Pass subscription service</a>.</p>
<p>Our Tom was one of those three million Rematch players, and had rather a good old time with it. "I feel like I've finally found a competitive online game that I enjoy and can't stop thinking about," he wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/for-the-love-of-ibrahimovic-rematch-players-learn-to-pass-before-i-become-the-very-thing-i-hate">Eurogamer's Rematch feature</a>. "I love it.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section>
<figure><a title="Nintendo Switch 2 Mario Kart World" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/91bf859864489/nintendo-switch-2-mario-kart-world.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Damien McFerran / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>We already know the Switch 2 has broken sales records in the US — just last month, Nintendo's upgraded hybrid console reportedly hit an <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/switch-2-sets-all-time-launch-record-for-video-game-hardware-in-the-us">"all-time launch week unit sales record for video game hardware"</a>. And now, Circana's Mat Piscatella has more data to back up that info.</p>
<p>Sharing the stats on Bluesky, not only is the Switch 2 the fastest-selling console in the US <em>ever</em>, but the launch also helped boost video game spending in the US to an all-time June high.</p>
<p>Spending on industry products increased by 22% in June 2025 compared to last year, which is a huge boost. And while the year's overall spending is still slightly behind 2024's (just by 2%), things are looking up thanks to the Switch 2.</p>

<p>Originally, we knew the console had sold 1.1 million units in its opening week, but by the month's end, that climbed to 1.6 million units. As a reminder, we know the console has sold over <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/its-official-switch-2-has-sold-over-3-5-million-units-globally-in-its-first-four-days">3.5 million units worldwide in its first four days</a>, so with the extra 5 million, console sales are already over 4 million.</p>
<p>Hardware spending has increased by 249% compared to last June — to $978 million — another record-setting month for sales, surpassing the previous record of $608 million in June 2008.</p>

<p>In terms of game sales, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> was the third best-selling game of the month, right behind Death Stranding 2: On the Beach and Elden Ring: Nightreign. However, Nintendo doesn't include digital sales in this data, so if we had to guess, Mario Kart World is <em>possibly</em> number one. Digital sales have boomed in recent years, after all.</p>
<p>In terms of Nintendo games, the Switch 2's line-up, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/cyberpunk-2077-ultimate-edition">Cyberpunk 2077</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/street-fighter-6-years-1-2-fighters-edition">Street Fighter 6</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/bravely-default-flying-fairy-hd-remaster">Bravely Default</a> all made the top ten, with other titles that got free Switch 2 upgrades or paid Switch 2 Editions also making up most of the rest of the list.</p>
<p>There's no stopping <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/mario_kart_8_deluxe">Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</a> or <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/minecraft">Minecraft</a>, though!</p>

<p>So, the Switch 2 is doing incredibly well, then! We'll likely hear more on sales figures at Nintendo's next financial briefing, which is due in August.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/the-outer-worlds-2-price-has-been-reduced-to-69-99/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The Outer Worlds 2, the second entry in the series developed by Obsidian Entertainment launching this year on PC and consoles, won't be Microsoft's first $80 game, as the game's price has been reduced ahead of its release in a few months.</p>



<p>In a new message shared today, developer Obisidian Entertainment confirmed that the game's price has been revised to $69.99 instead of $79.99. Considering the series is a relatively recent one without a massive following, pricing The Outer Worlds 2 at $80 was a really weird decision that might have impacted the game's sales significantly.</p>







<p>The last we saw of The Outer Worlds 2 was last month during this year's Xbox Game Showcase with a trailer providing an overview of the story which also confirmed the game's release date, and a more in-depth Direct presentation that provided some additional information on the game's mechanics. Judging from the footage seen so far, the new entry in the series is setting out to expand its predecessor's mechanics considerably, which should result in a game more enjoyable than its predecessor, which left something to be desired in the moment-to-moment gameplay, as highlighted by Alessio in his <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-outer-worlds-obsidian-never-changes/">review.</a></p>



<p>"<em>The Outer Worlds is pretty much exactly what you'd expect from Obsidian. The first-person action RPG features a great setting, fantastic writing and remarkable, complex characters to meet. The moment-to-moment gameplay isn't as exciting, though, failing to measure up with the best in the genre. Still, there's plenty to like here as long as you know what you're getting into, not to mention the potential for a sequel to be much better, particularly if the developers had a higher budget to work with.</em>"</p>



<p>The Outer Worlds 2 launches on October 29 for PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S.</p>

            <p>Developer Julian LeFay, a key cog in the early days of Bethesda and the development of classic Elder Scrolls RPGs <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-arena">Arena</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-ii-daggerfall">Daggerfall</a>, has died. His passing was announced by OnceLost Games, the studio he co-founded in 2019, and follows a years-long battle with cancer.</p>
<p>LeFay <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/former-elder-scrolls-developer-julian-lefay-steps-away-from-his-daggerfall-esque-the-wayward-realms-as-cancer-worsens">stepped away from his most recent development post</a> as technical director at OnceLost, where he'd been working on Daggerfall-inspired RPG <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-wayward-realms">The Wayward Realms</a> alongside fellow Bethesda veteran Ted Peterson, last week. OnceLost revealed at the time that this was due to his cancer worsening, writing that LeFay's doctors had informed them "his time with us is limited".</p>
<!--more-->
<p>In a statement on LeFay's passing aged 59, the studio's team wrote that the Danish-born developer "was not just a colleague - he was a visionary who fundamentally shaped the gaming industry as we know it today" and praised his "unwavering commitment to pushing the boundaries of what RPGs could achieve".</p>
<p>"Throughout his courageous battle with cancer, Julian never wavered in his passion for The Wayward Realms," they added, "Even during his illness, he continued to share his vision with our team, mentor our developers, and ensure that every aspect of the game reflected his commitment to creating something truly extraordinary. His strength, determination, and unwavering focus inspire us all."</p> <div>

<p>LeFay joined Bethesda as a programmer in 1987, and was a key influence on many other RPGs through his work on Elder Scrolls. He was programming lead on Arena and Battlespire, project leader on 1996's legendary Daggerfall, and is credited on The Elder Scrolls Adventures: Redguard and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-iii-morrowind">Morrowind</a>. According to Peterson, his name <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_YhxCkF09Y">was also an inspiration</a> for Tamriel's god of wisdom and logic, Julianos.</p>
<p>LeFay also served as director and chief programmer on Bethesda's The Terminator and follow-up The Terminator 2029 back in those early days. He largely disappeared from the spotlight after leaving Bethesda, working on various projects including some with Sega, before being dragged back in via an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IGLGi5RK8V8">interview with YouTuber Ian Phoenix in 2017</a>, which snowballed into LeFay and Peterson deciding to team back up on an RPG that'd be a worthy successor to the likes of Daggerfall.</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>It’s with great sadness we learn of the passing of Julian LeFay. </p><p>He was the driving force in the creation of The Elder Scrolls and the foundations of Bethesda as a game studio. </p><p>Simply put, without Julian, we would not be here today. If you had the opportunity to work with… <a href="https://t.co/55bJAaL7qz">pic.twitter.com/55bJAaL7qz</a></p></div>— Bethesda Game Studios (@BethesdaStudios) <a href="https://twitter.com/BethesdaStudios/status/1948047731429159330?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 23, 2025</a></blockquote></div>

<p>That led to OnceLost's founding in 2019 and a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/former-daggerfall-developers-reveal-a-teaser-for-their-open-world-rpg">Kickstarter for The Wayward Realms</a>. As Peterson and the studio's staff wrote when they revealed LeFay had stepped away from work on the game, their plan is to keep on developing their RPG in a fashion that matches his vision for it.</p>
<p>Thanks to LeFay for all of his contributions to the medium and all the best to those he leaves behind.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/former-bethesda-developer-julian-lefay-known-as-the-father-of-the-elder-scrolls-has-died]]></content:encoded>

This marked <em>Outer Worlds 2 </em>as the company’s first attempt at selling games for more than $70, and it followed Nintendo’s lead of selling <em>Mario Kart World </em>on Switch 2 for $80. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/microsoft-xbox-series-x-s-price-increase-may-2025-1851778615?_gl=1*d8jxh*_ga*NzE0NzM5NTc5LjE3Mjk4Njg5MzU.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*czE3NDkzOTkzMjIkbzQzMCRnMSR0MTc0OTQwODgxMSRqNDUkbDAkaDA.&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/microsoft-xbox-series-x-s-price-increase-may-2025-1851778615?_gl=1*d8jxh*_ga*NzE0NzM5NTc5LjE3Mjk4Njg5MzU.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*czE3NDkzOTkzMjIkbzQzMCRnMSR0MTc0OTQwODgxMSRqNDUkbDAkaDA.">This was part of a larger price increase that Xbox announced in May</a></span> that suggested some first-party games would cost $80. </p><p>But now, things have changed, and <em>Outer Worlds 2</em> will only cost $70 for the base version of the game.

In fact, according to Circana, 82% of Nintendo Switch 2 purchasers also picked up Mario Kart World.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That comes from <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-nintendo-switch-2-is-the-fastest-selling-gaming-hardware-in-us-history">Circana's June report</a>, which shared that the Nintendo Switch 2 is officially the fastest-selling video game console in the U.S. In total, the Nintendo Switch sold 1.6 million units in the U.S. in June, beating out the PlayStation 4's previous record of 1.1 million units in November of 2012.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Of those 1.6 million unit sales, 82% either purchased the Nintendo Switch 2 + Mario Kart World bundle, or bought the game standalone. This helped propel Mario Kart World to become the third best-selling game of the month in Circana's rankings, though it's possible it could have ranked even higher due to the exclusion of Nintendo's digital data from the sales charts.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/nintendo-switch-becomes-fastest-selling-system-in-nintendo-history" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">As a comparison point</a>, when the Nintendo Switch 1 launched, over 100% of new console owners that month also purchased its launch game, The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, worldwide. Yes, the game sold more copies on Switch than Nintendo did Switch systems. "This may be attributed to people who purchased both a limited edition of the game to collect and a second version to play," Nintendo suggested at the time. So Mario Kart World isn't quite beating those numbers.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But it may also be doing even <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/switch-2-the-fastest-selling-nintendo-console-in-uk-history-but-ps5-and-xbox-series-xs-launches-were-bigger">better in other countries</a>. According to a <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-nintendo-switch-2-is-now-allegedly-frances-fastest-selling-console-ever-with-over-200k-sold-so-far/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">report from Wccftech</a>, the game's Switch 2 attach rate in France was over 95%.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Additionally, we learned from Circana this morning that 32% of Nintendo Switch 2 purchasers in June also bought a Nintendo Switch 2 Pro Controller, helping make it the best-selling accessory of the month in the U.S. by dollar sales.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Unshockingly, one of the reasons people are buying Mario Kart World is because it's pretty dang good. We <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mario-kart-world-review">gave the game an 8/10</a>, saying that it "may not make the most convincing case that going open-world was the boost the series needed, but excellent multiplayer racing, incredible polish, and the thrilling new Knockout Tour mode still more than live up to its legacy."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.
