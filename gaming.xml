            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/over-the-top-wwi-invites-players-to-100-v-100-multiplayer-playtest/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Today, Flying Squirrel Entertainment, the team behind Battle Cry of Freedom and <a href="http://wccftech.com/mount-targeting-800-characters-at-60fps/">Mount &amp; Blade: Warband</a>, has announced that the playtest for their highly-anticipated upcoming title, Over The Top: WWI, has started and will run through to 4 AM EST / 10 AM CET on December 9. This title is shaping up to be chaotic carnage, as players will get to participate in third-person 100 v 100 multiplayer, as well as single-player combat set in the muddy fields and trenches of the First World War. Players are given the option to play as either the Central Powers or the Triple Entente.</p>
<p>For those interested in participating in the playtest, it is completely free to join, and those interested can join via the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2778610/Over_The_Top_WWI/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">game's Steam Page</a>. If you aren't sure whether this is something you want to play, Flying Squirrel Entertainment has released a trailer that shows off some of what you can expect from the playtest. It's just over a minute and a half long and shows off some of the chaos you can expect to get into.</p>
<p>"This latest will offer a host of features and updates, including destructible environments, the ability to call in airstrikes, and more. We are now entering the final stages of development as we build the game alongside our community and march towards release," says the team at Flying Squirrel Entertainment.</p>
<p><iframe title="Over The Top: WWI - December Playtest live now!" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GGpzPFUjtS4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>If you don't want to play with other people, you can play in a single-player mode in the Over The Top: WWI playtest and utilize bots instead in an entirely destructible and realistic environment based on the First World War. The single-player mode is easy to navigate, as it has an "instant battle" mode, with confrontations taking place in front of you with up to 200 bots. There are plenty of weapons to try out and experiment with, including Bolt-Action Rifles, Revolvers, Axes, Grenades, and Flamethrowers. There are over 50 unique weapons to choose from, with six different types of armored vehicles and ten different Artillery pieces to experiment with.</p>
<p>As stated above, the environments are completely destructible, adding to the mayhem and chaos of the game. You are able to destroy bridges, fell trees, enemy fortifications, and even punch holes in walls to test out your strength.&nbsp; Along with the destructible environments, there is dynamic terrain. This means that any artillery shells, hand grenades, and rifle grenades used will create realistic craters in the ground. Additionally, you can use shovels and pickaxes to manipulate the ground to your benefit and create trenches to help you defend against the enemy in Over The Top: WWI.</p>

The first widget it includes is a recreation of <em>Snake </em>which was the most memorable of the three games pre-installed on the Nokia 6110 when it launched 26 years ago.</p><p>Although the original game was played by pressing buttons as cellphones lacked touchscreens, the snake in Nothing’s version is steered using directional screen swipes, while a double tap pauses the action, <a href="https://retrododo.com/nothing-adds-retro-snake-game-to-their-smartphones-widgets/">according to Retro Dodo</a>. But the gameplay is the same, with players scoring points by eating red dots while trying to avoid colliding with themselves as the snake grows longer and longer.</p><div><p>The inspiration for the new widget came from <a href="https://bento.me/rahuljanardhanan">Rahul Janardhanan</a>, an artist who earlier this year <a href="https://x.com/raonehere/status/1749069277960057048">designed and shared a collection of 10 concepts</a> for potential Nothing OS widgets. Janardhanan’s work <a href="https://nothing.community/d/20998-community-widgets-snake-game">caught the eye of the company</a> and Nothing’s software team worked with a community developer to create the widget.</p></div><p>The new <em>Snake</em> game widget, and Nothing’s new widgets app, follow a similar initiative by Nothing to work with its community of users. In October, the company announced its <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/30/24282844/nothing-phone-2a-plus-community-edition-glowing">Nothing Phone 2A Plus Community Edition</a> featuring an updated glow-in-the-dark design, new wallpapers, and even packaging that was created by the company’s “most talented followers.”</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dragon-age-the-veilguard-top-tips-beginners">Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a> won't receive any major story DLC. It also ends pretty decisively, save for a few hints about the future of Thedas in a secret post-credits scene. How final is that air of finality? Is <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dragon-age">Dragon Age</a> going back on the shelf for the forseeable? Fear not, say game director Corinne Busche and series creative director John Epler, for the universe of Dragon Age has many yarns yet to spin. The next game won't necessarily be an action game with RPG trappings, either, for much like <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/final-fantasy-game">Final Fantasy</a>, Dragon Age exists in a state of continual "reinvention". 
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
Veilguard's neater ending is partly owing to BioWare's desire to avoid a repeat of the situation with <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dragon-age-inquisition">Dragon Age: Inquisition</a>, the previous game from 2014, which paved the way for Veilguard's premise with its DLC. Speaking to Eurogamer in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-big-dragon-age-the-veilguard-post-release-interview-it-was-never-going-to-match-the-dragon-age-4-in-peoples-minds">a lengthy postmortem chat</a> after Veilguard's release, Epler commented that continuing that game's knotty storyline while introducing newcomers to the series was a real headache - though perhaps not as big a headache as <a href="https://blog.bioware.com/2024/06/06/TheVeilguard/">the initial struggle to make a multiplayer game</a>, in line with publisher EA's live service ambitions at the time.
</p>
<p>
"Inquisition did end with some fairly hefty dangling plot threads," he explained. "Obviously there's the post-credits scene with Solas and Flemeth, and it felt at the time - because I was on Inquisition, I was on the Trespasser team - we looked at what we already had and decided, okay, we want to do one last chapter, one last story beat. The difference in The Veilguard is the story ends pretty conclusively. There is, obviously, a secret post-credits scene, but that's less of 'here is an immediate thing that you now need to be aware of', and more 'here's a hint as to what the future will be'."
</p>
<p>
"We wanted to make sure that this one ended in a less ambiguous way, where it's very clear that this story is done," he went on. "What comes next, you will see, but it won't require the same level of 'okay let's catch you up on what's happened'. I'm still proud of the team and what they did at the beginning of this one, but there's a lot that comes from previous games that feed into this one."
</p><p>
Busche dropped a few more concrete tips about possible Dragon Age 5 plots. "Isn't it interesting how a lot of the threats that have been prevalent throughout the franchise only scratch at the surface of the mysteries and possibilities in the IP?" she said. "There's been a lot of exploration of the Blight, the elven gods, the elven people, and it's wonderful subject matter. However, it also makes me curious about the other aspects that are less explored and equally as interesting: the nature of the qunari, what's across the seas, what's happening with the titans, the development of the dwarven people. 
</p>
<p>
"So in many ways, I feel like answering some of these long-threaded mysteries that are specific to the Blight and specific to the elves, this gives some space to explore other ideas in the future," she concluded, inconclusively.
</p>
<p>
Veilguard is more of an action game than an RPG, much to the disappointment of Inquisition diehards and crustier BioWare followers at large. Epler and Busche discuss this in the Eurogamer interview, with Busche coyly observing that Dragon Age is "a franchise of reinvention", and that the next sequel might switch genres once again. 
</p>
<p>
"In some ways there are some parallels in that regard, to say, the Final Fantasy series," she said. "Of course, very different in terms of choice and consequences, and so many other factors, but there are those RPG franchises that embrace that reinvention, that when a new one gets announced, it really piques your curiosity about where are we going to go? What kind of adventure is this going to be?"
</p><p>
I'm still making my way through Veilguard. I'm enjoying the combat and the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/i-am-deeply-enamoured-by-dragon-age-the-veilguards-intricate-and-ridiculous-fashion-design">costumes</a>, but I do yet yearn for Inquisition's (horribly unwieldy) tactical planning and its gratuitous base management. So colour me hopeful that Veilguard's successor is more of a role-player. Still, why restrict ourselves to the spectrum between action game and RPG? I wouldn't mind playing an immersive sim set in Thedas, or perhaps a dating game.

            <link>https://wccftech.com/gaijins-game-showcase-shows-off-dagor-engines-power/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/gaijin%E2%80%99s-game-showcase-shows-off-dagor-engine%E2%80%99s-power.1051854/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/gaijins-game-showcase-shows-off-dagor-engines-power/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>In a new video released by Gaijin Entertainment, people can compare the studio's Dagor Engine, which has been free and open source since last year, with the industry-leading Unreal Engine 5 from Epic Games. The video shows off content from the East District, a part of Gaijin's unannounced game, with the content in the demo being made using both Dagor Engine and Unreal Engine 5. In addition to the video, Gaijin Entertainment has also released the full code of one of Dagor Engine's multiplayer frameworks under a permissive license, along with the art sources of one of the multiplayer samples. Those interested can look at the East District demo on both Dagor Engine and Unreal Engine, depending on your preference.</p>
<p><iframe title="Dagor Engine — East District" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/miABl6aekBA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Gaijin Entertainment decided to do this to showcase the engine by asking their partners over at Hooks Creative Studio to create an FPS map that was inspired by iconic maps of the past. This map was built by the team at Hooks Creative Studio totally from scratch, using Megascan and modern Photogrammetry assets on Unreal Engine 5. Once this was done, they then continued by moving the map over to Dagor Engine, which is now being used in their unannounced game. Gaijin Entertainment has said that it's beneficial to have it in both Unreal Engine and Dagor Engine, as they can use it for comparison and use it as an internal validation of the existing Dagor technology.</p>
<p>Gaijin found that the Dagor map runs faster while providing an equal or superior (subjectively, they admitted) visual fidelity. The map uses state-of-the-art technologies, such as real-time global illumination and advanced anti-aliasing. While it doesn't use vendor-specific performance-enhancing techniques such as DLSS, XeSS, or FSR, Dagor does support all of them. <a href="https://gaijinent.com/news/demos-of-a-new-gaijins-game-showcase-dagor-engine-power" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Gaijin has said that the Dagor demo</a> operates in native resolution in most configurations, while the Unreal Engine version does not, which helps demonstrate the performance of the Dagor Engine.</p>
<p>The company admits that they can't compare them fully, as the Unreal Engine version of the demo has the potential to be further optimized by experienced developers. However, by releasing both versions of the demos, they hope to encourage developers to explore using Dagor Engine in more of their projects. This engine powers titles such as <a href="https://wccftech.com/gaijin-ceo-interview-we-wouldnt-have-launched-war-thunder-on-steams-current-state/">War Thunder</a> and Enlisted.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dragon-age-the-veilguard-character-creator-free<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>EA and BioWare have announced how they're planning to celebrate&nbsp;<em>Dragon Age&nbsp;</em>Day, and the celebrations include a free version of&nbsp;<em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</em>'s character creator, plus more.</p>

<p>Over on the official&nbsp;<em>Dragon Age&nbsp;</em><a href="https://www.ea.com/games/dragon-age/dragon-age-the-veilguard/news/da-day-2024" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">blog</a>, EA and BioWare say they're commemorating&nbsp;<em>Dragon Age&nbsp;</em>Day, which falls on December 4th each year, with "several activities", starting with a fourth patch for&nbsp;<em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</em>.</p>

<p>We don't know what's in that patch yet; at time of writing, the <a href="https://www.ea.com/en-gb/games/dragon-age/dragon-age-the-veilguard/news/patch-4-release-notes" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">link in the blog to the patch notes</a> is dead. Still, hopefully, said patch notes will be updated later in the day, so you'll be able to see what's coming to&nbsp;<em>The Veilguard&nbsp;</em>then.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dragon-age-the-veilguard-character-creator-free-archer.jpg?itok=DeAMRTWx 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dragon-age-the-veilguard-character-creator-free-archer.jpg?itok=KovWiz9Z 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</em>'s character creator is being released for free.</figcaption></figure><p>As well as Patch 4, you're also getting&nbsp;<em>The Veilguard</em>'s character creator for free. That's right; starting today, you'll apparently be able to download and try out the full character creator before buying the game.</p>

<p>It's not available at time of writing, but like Patch 4, I'm expecting it'll be made available as the day goes on. You'll be able to try it out on all platforms on which&nbsp;<em>The Veilguard&nbsp;</em>is available.</p>

<p>EA and BioWare say there's no time limit on the Character Creator, either; you can try it out for as long as you like so that you can get the perfect Rook ahead of starting your adventure.</p>

<p>Lastly, BioWare is also gifting every <i>The Veilguard&nbsp;</i>owner with a special set of armor and cosmetics reminiscent of&nbsp;<em>Dragon Age 2</em>'s protagonist Hawke. You'll need to download Patch 4 and complete "The Singing Blade" to grab your cosmetics.</p>




<p><em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard&nbsp;</em>is the latest game in EA and BioWare's&nbsp;<em>Dragon Age&nbsp;</em>series. It sees protagonist Rook attempting to stop two elven gods from conquering the world while also dealing with the machinations of elven trickster Solas.</p>

<p>The game represents <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dragon-age-veilguard-gameplay-trailer" rel="nofollow">something of a departure</a> from&nbsp;<em>Dragon Age</em>'s traditional RPG leanings; it's arguably more of an action-adventure game with RPG elements, so if you're a <em>Dragon Age&nbsp;</em>fan, bear that in mind before you pick it up.</p>

<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1845910/Dragon_Age_The_Veilguard/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/dragon-age-the-veilguard/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/dragon-age-the-veilguard/BSDX4FNNC0DK" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>.

            <p>
Astrometica is <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/subnautica">Subnautica</a> in space and to developer BeryMery's credit, the game makes zero effort to hide this. It's right there in the dog Latin of the title. It's got Subnautica's premise of being a shipwreck survivor starting afresh from an escape capsule, piecing together the backstory signal by signal, database entry by database entry. It's got Subnautica's core loop of exploring while dealing with the problem of decreasing oxygen, scavenging fist-sized chunks of raw material and scanning wreckage for blueprints, then crafting items and gear back at base.  
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
It's got its own close variations on Subnautica's fonts, Subnautica's tubular habitats and building interface, Subnautica's curvy, slightly luminous gadgetry, Subnautica's softly contoured menus, even a fair approximation of Subnautica's lilting, characterless music. Based on a quick 20 minutes with the Steam demo, being set the other side of an atmosphere is the <em>only</em> thing that differentiates Astrometica from the Unknown Worlds <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-survival-games-on-pc">survival</a> sim - OK, that and perhaps the gentlest drizzling of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hardspace-shipbreaker">Hardspace: Shipbreaker</a> in the ability to melt the locks off cargo pods in zero gravity. What absolutely brazen cheek! This is probably going to make a trillion dollars. Here's a trailer.

"Subnautica but in space" might lure the magpie gaze of the internet's survival simmers, but it threatens to be a step back from the richness of Subnautica. After all, a huge part of the latter's charm is that the world is alive, changing dramatically as you go deeper and push out from the sunny coral reef at the heart. Outer space lacks that sense of structure and vitality. Not many fish out here. So it's just as well that Astrometica appears to take place predominantly in an asteroid field littered with domed habitats where other beings might dwell, to say nothing of abandoned ships and "cosmic anomalies". 
</p><p>
There appear to be a few active threats - jovial tentacle boys that lunge at your visor, for example - together with outcrops of astral flora that look like the offspring of a lava lamp and a swingball. Still, it all feels very empty right outside your escape pod. I genuinely found myself glancing around for those gumball-tailed seals who are among the first larger creatures you meet in Subnautica. I realise that in space, nobody can hear you scream, but I do miss their hooting.
</p>
<p>
Technically, of course, Subnautica is already Subnautica in space. Your character was an astronaut right up till they crashlanded on some weird planet full of germs and leviathans. It's almost as though each game's lead characters were originally crewmates aboard the same doomed starship. When the shit hit the fan, Astrometica's protagonist happened to board an escape pod pointing in the opposite direction. I find that notion funny. I'm not sure Unknown Worlds are laughing. Astrometica is out in early access this month. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2353250/Astrometica/">Read more on Steam</a>.

<p>Warhorse Studios has just announced that Kingdom Come: Deliverance II will be released one week earlier than planned. It’ll now be launching worldwide on February 4, 2025. This news follows a delay that pushed the game back into 2025.</p>



<p>On social media, the news was announced by the team in conjunction with a promise that ‘more exciting news’ is coming in the following days. This all kicks off with a new story trailer that’s being released tomorrow.</p>

<h2 id="h-audentes-fortuna-iuvat">Audentes Fortuna Iuvat</h2>



<p>Kingdom Come: Deliverance II is shaping up to be one hell of an RPG. It’s riddled with historical accuracy and it’s one of the most faithful representations of the setting I’ve ever seen. I got hands-on with the game during Gamescom and loved every second I played.</p>



<p>It helps that I’m a massive fan of the first game, which recently hit a new milestone after <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-sales/">selling eight million copies</a> since launching in 2018.</p>



<p>Earlier this year, I was fortunate enough to catch up with Tom McKay, who plays the series’ protagonist, Henry of Skalitz:</p>

<p>Here’s the full post from Warhorse Studios on social media:</p>



<blockquote>

<p>With the release date pushing one week forward, we have a bunch of more exciting news coming in the following days. </p>

<p>BioWare has announced that the Character Creator for Dragon Age: The Veilguard is getting a standalone release. The announcement was <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/dragon-age/dragon-age-the-veilguard/news/da-day-2024?utm_campaign=datv_pub_ww_ic_soco_ltre_character-creator-blog&amp;utm_source=linktree&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;cid=82705&amp;ts=1733330768641" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">part of the company’s</a> Dragon Age Day 2024 message to players.</p>



<p>Coming to all platforms, the Character Creator will be completely free, and allow players to build characters before ever buying or loading the game up for the first time. The app allows players to create and then transfer their character over to the game as long as it’s on the same platform. That means you can’t create a character on PC and expect to bring them over to PS5 or Xbox Series.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">MSI has revealed new versions of its Claw handheld gaming PC, which will be available in seven- and eight-inch models. Pricing starts at $799 for the <a href="https://howl.link/ydop8durkl7we?article_name=Gamespot&amp;article_url=https://www.gamespot.com/17333256107402?u1=subid_value" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Claw 7 AI+</a> and $899 for the <a href="https://howl.link/4ae9vs9x4u71w?article_name=Gamespot&amp;article_url=https://www.gamespot.com/17333256068282?u1=subid_value" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Claw 8 AI+</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">The new MSI Claws will feature several upgrades when compared to its predecessor, like bigger batteries, tweaks to its ergonomic design, and Intel's new Lunar Lake Core Ultra 7 processors. These will also be Copilot+ PC-capable handhelds, hence the AI label. RAM has been doubled for the new models, as these have 32GB each, and the CPU speed has increased to 2.2GHz. The original MSI Claw had a 1.2GHz CPU on its Ultra 5 base model, while the Ultra 7 version had a 1.4GHz CPU.</p><p dir="ltr">Another big change is the <em>look</em> of the MSI Claw, as you'll be able to pick one up that sports khaki-colored panels. MSI says this design was inspired by wind-sculpted desert rocks, but if you'd prefer something plainer, these will be available in black as well.</p><p dir="ltr">The sticks, bumpers, D-pad, and the Hall Effect triggers have received a redesign to allow for more accurate button presses, and MSI says that both of the Claws are equipped with a 120Hz VRR LCD display with an improved resolution of 1920 x 1200.</p><p dir="ltr">The Claw 8 has an 80-watt-hour battery--a sizable increase compared to the 53-watt-hour battery from the first model--while the Claw 7 is equipped with a 54.5-watt-hour battery. Here's a closer look at the specs on each one.</p><h2 dir="ltr">MSI Claw 8 AI+</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large"

Of course, horror is cool and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://howtomarketagame.com/2023/10/02/every-indie-game-developer-should-make-a-horror-game/">every studio should make a horror game</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> (they even do well on Steam!), but there are also drawbacks. Our game, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>End of Ember</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, is only a year into production but has already encountered a number of these risks: let’s dive in and explore what they are and how to address them.</span></p><h3 data-testid="content-text" id="1.&nbsp;The genre is diverse">1.&nbsp;The genre is diverse</h3><h4 data-testid="content-text" id="The Risk">The Risk</h4><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Horror is like metal: if you’re not into it, it all sounds the same; but for fans there are so many sub-genres. Survival horror, psychological horror, mascot horror, slasher horror, comedy horror: without even going into gameplay categories or modes, the diversity is enormous. Without a clear sense of what kind of horror you are making, your game is likely to fall between the gaps or, worse, come across as sweaty.</span></p><p>Horror is a thing.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>[Source: </span></span><span data-testid="content-text"><a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://plus.gamediscover.co/">GameDiscoverCo Plus</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>, accessed 29/11/24]</span></span></p><h4 data-testid="content-text" id="Managing the Risk">Managing the Risk</h4><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Your creative team needs to really understand horror – it’s not something you can do from the outside. Our Creative Director </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://danmcguiness.com.au/about-2/">Dan McGuiness</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> has been a huge fan of horror since he was a kid, and he now hosts the </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://terrorvisionpod.wordpress.com/">Terrorvision Horror Podcast</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, so he definitely knows his stuff. In this way he can craft a true comedy horror that amps up the gore like nothing else and gets lots of laughs from players.</span></p><h3 data-testid="content-text" id="2.&nbsp;Copyright/IP concerns">2.&nbsp;Copyright/IP concerns</h3><h4 data-testid="content-text" id="The Risk">The Risk</h4><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Horror is a self-referential genre, and while this might produce marketing opportunities, one immediate concern might be about copyright and infringing on IP. Some developers worry that by including references to other franchises or IP you might be setting yourself up for a takedown notice or legal action.</span></p><p>Please don’t sue us, Linda Blair!</p><h4 data-testid="content-text" id="Managing the Risk">Managing the Risk</h4><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The key thing here is remembering that while actual intellectual property might be protected by law, parody and references are much more acceptable. (Note this is not legal advice.) Of course you should not use frames, models, or the actual product of anyone else’s work, but drawing your own hockey mask reminiscent of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Friday the 13th</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> or a puzzle box like the Lament Configuration from </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Hellraiser </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">will probably keep you above the line as long as you produce the assets yourself and do not attempt to represent it as original IP.</span></p><h3 data-testid="content-text" id="3.&nbsp;Crafting 'agency mechanics'">3.&nbsp;Crafting 'agency mechanics'</h3><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The Risk</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">One of the main challenges (and opportunities) of horror game development is closely managing the player’s power in all situations, or what we might call ‘</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/14626268.2013.776971">agency mechanics</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">’. The risk here is that you will either lock down player autonomy so much that they can’t act meaningfully in the world and ragequit, or that they will be so free that the experience isn’t engaging enough.</span></p><h4 data-testid="content-text" id="Managing the Risk">Managing the Risk</h4><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As with most gameplay design, the solution here is to </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://ericzimmerman.wordpress.com/2013/10/19/how-i-teach-game-design-lesson-1-the-game-design-process/">design, playtest, iterate</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">. Design your mechanics with the idea of player agency in mind from the outset, then build a prototype early and playtest as much as possible for player autonomy in particular. Observe closely which particular mechanics constrain or enable agency, get player feedback of all kinds, and iterate until you get the balance right.</span></p><h3 data-testid="content-text" id="4.&nbsp;Optimisation challenges of gore">4.&nbsp;Optimisation challenges of gore</h3><h4 data-testid="content-text" id="The Risk">The Risk</h4><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>End of Ember</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> prides itself on its gore engine, and producing gore effects that other games just won’t try. Of course, there is usually a reason that something hasn’t been done before, and in our prototype we discovered that detailed gore can produce framerate issues as the engine tries to calculate for all the pieces of carrion and viscera that adorn the floor and walls.</span></p><p>The gore in our boss level chugged our framerate… or maybe it was the rooms, or persistence … or the entire codebase?</p><h4 data-testid="content-text" id="Managing the Risk">Managing the Risk</h4><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Often, indie devs leave optimisation until late in production, but we have found it useful to plan optimisation throughout development. We have explored options such as persistence management, occlusion culling, draw call batching and object pooling - and we are implementing them earlier in development rather than waiting until later and debugging.</span></p><h3 data-testid="content-text" id="5. Pearl-clutching">5. Pearl-clutching</h3><h4 data-testid="content-text" id="The Risk">The Risk</h4><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Horror is certainly not for everyone, but it’s not the same as saying, say, JRPGs aren’t for everyone. Horror games sometimes induce a kind of moral panic, perhaps especially amongst those who still think that video games are mostly for children. Muted scowls of disapproval are well known to horror gamedevs.</span></p><p>Is it the blood? It’s the blood, isn’t it?</p><h4 data-testid="content-text" id="Managing the Risk">Managing the Risk</h4><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The way to manage this risk is to be clear about the fact that horror games are not meant for children, and they are not intended to somehow infiltrate young minds and terrify or otherwise corrupt them. Managing appropriate boundaries and classification systems will also help to change the culture and thinking around this issue, but admittedly it’s a long game.</span></p><h3 data-testid="content-text" id="6.&nbsp;Steam page approval">6.&nbsp;Steam page approval</h3><h4 data-testid="content-text" id="The Risk">The Risk</h4><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As with any kind of mature content, going through Steam page review and approval can be challenging: </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>End of Ember</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> was reviewed six times before being approved for public release. This is not Steam’s fault, and was mostly about our own workflows and lack of knowledge of the process: for example, capsule art is available to a broad audience and cannot be managed by warnings in a content survey.</span></p><p>This capsule art is substantially revised from the one we originally submitted, because it needed to be for broad public access.</p><h4 data-testid="content-text" id="Managing the Risk">Managing the Risk</h4><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As with all production, give about four times the duration you think you need for your Steam page to be reviewed, and then double that. Make sure your Content Survey is as accurate as can be and don’t expect the content warnings to cover your capsule art. Note that Steam reviews are done by different people on different occasions, so the feedback is not always consistent or progressive.</span></p><h3 data-testid="content-text" id="7.&nbsp;Attending conventions">7.&nbsp;Attending conventions</h3><h4 data-testid="content-text" id="The Risk">The Risk</h4><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">We getting a theme here? Many public events such as game conventions have only special circumstances for games with mature content. Since most indie projects in early production do not have authorised classifications, event organisers tend to be fairly conservative on games’ appropriateness for their audience. This is entirely understandable, given branding, PR and reputation and so on.</span></p><h4 data-testid="content-text" id="Managing the Risk">Managing the Risk</h4><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It’s realistic to expect that your game is just not going to be suitable for many public events. Look at all the amazing online traction that a good horror game will get on social media (especially during October), and save the public showings for more private events. Or at least negotiate early with event organisers around the suitability of your game, and expect to be disappointed.</span></p><h3 data-testid="content-text" id="8.&nbsp;Reduced visibility">8.&nbsp;Reduced visibility</h3><h4 data-testid="content-text" id="The Risk">The Risk</h4><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Many of the above risks have a potential knock-on effect to visibility: obviously, not attending conventions is a block, and a particularly spicy content survey on Steam may flag your app as ‘potentially unlawful’ in some jurisdictions. Reduced visibility (especially to a mass market) is a general risk with horror game.</span></p><p>Nein!</p><h4 data-testid="content-text" id="Managing the Risk">Managing the Risk</h4><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Visibility risks are a challenge with any game, just more so with horror. With 35 games released on Steam per day it’s always already hard for indie gamedevs, so this just amplifies the challenge. Focus extra on marketing: identify your target, go to where they are, and encourage them to engage with your awesome content rather than dreaming of selling a game to everyone.</span></p><h3 data-testid="content-text" id="9.&nbsp;Saturated market">9.&nbsp;Saturated market</h3><h4 data-testid="content-text" id="The Risk">The Risk</h4><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Steam tag reports indicate that there are over 10,000 games tagged ‘horror’: more than anyone could play in a single deathtime. So while there is definitely a market for horror games, this market is already well-served, and there is the risk of your game being submerged under a mass of other FPS survival horror games set in a misty rural town.</span></p><p>Through this fog I can’t even see the other 34 games published on Steam today.</p><h4 data-testid="content-text" id="Managing the Risk">Managing the Risk</h4><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">All the usual design-meets-marketing advice applies here: know the competition, know your market, design something with a unique visual style and/or experience, be true to your artistic vision, and deliver a game that players won’t want to share with their Grandma. Something like this:</span></p><iframe title="Embedded content" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8AZEjOGR-B4" height="nullpx" width="100%" data-testid="iframe" loading="lazy" scrolling="auto"></iframe><h3 data-testid="content-text" id="Summary">Summary</h3><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">If you want to make a horror game you will no doubt face risks in production, development, and marketing. It’s worth it, but if you employ the usual lifelong learning, planning, and iteration processes you apply across your entire development, you’ll be best placed to avoid a horrific development experience of your own. If worst comes to worst, respawn.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">End of Ember is available to </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3217880/End_of_Ember/?utm_source=blogs&amp;utm_medium=game_developer&amp;utm_campaign=gnarly_content">Wishlist on Steam</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">: share it around, just not with your Grandma.</span></p><h3 data-testid="content-text" id="Acknowledgment">Acknowledgment</h3><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Thanks to Logan Baker of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://www.royalreignstudios.com/">Royal Reign Studios</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> for technical advice to make me sound less like a numpty to programmers.</span></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/fortnite-levels<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A new season of <em>Fortnite</em> launched over the weekend, following a <a href="https://x.com/FortniteGame/status/1862950664281919658" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">very popular</a> concert event that I managed to miss every time it ran. The season brings <a href="https://www.fortnite.com/news/fight-as-a-ronin-in-fortnite-battle-royale-chapter-6-season-1-hunters" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new</a> landmarks, changes to movement, some creatures running around the world–and, it seems, removes the ability to see your squadmates’ levels, which is totally screwing me up.</p><p>I usually play <em>Fortnite </em>in squads with strangers, and <a href="https://kotaku.com/fortnite-battle-royale-the-kotaku-review-1833890299" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">these days</a> I keep my voice chat off. This means the start of every new round is taken up by trying to parse if I’ve landed with a good squad–players who know what they’re doing and stick together–or a bad squad–players who just want to screw around, or who run off and get themselves killed in remote parts of the map where I will nevertheless rush to try to <a href="https://kotaku.com/please-stop-quitting-before-i-can-revive-you-1841606763" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revive</a> them out of an overdeveloped sense of duty. One way I figure out the potential social dynamics is by seeing what level everyone is, indicated by a number next to their names in the top left of my screen. Higher levels don’t necessarily mean a better squad, of course, but at the very least I use them as a decision-making factor when my squad can’t agree on where to land–I’ll follow the player with the highest level, figuring they probably know where they’re going.</p><p>But when I booted up the new season last night, player levels no longer appeared. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/1h4fp8f/did_they_remove_displaying_levels_in_a_match/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Other</a> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/1h4eb1j/account_levels_not_showing_in_pubs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">players</a> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/1h46qy4/theres_no_more_level_up_in_the_top_left_which/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">have</a> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/1h53wh2/why_cant_i_see_anyones_levels_or_platform_icon/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">noticed</a> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/1h53wh2/why_cant_i_see_anyones_levels_or_platform_icon/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">it</a> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/1h4r0iq/levels_not_displaying_when_in_game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">too</a>, and largely aren’t happy with it. Overall, I think it’s probably a good change: I would often find myself in matches where higher-level squadmates would <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/1h4r0iq/comment/m08av4s/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">bail</a> if they were too high above the rest of the squad, which felt bad and made my squads lopsided.&nbsp;</p><p>I know that a player’s level doesn’t <em>really</em> mean anything about them as a squadmate. And there are other <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/fortnite/fortnite-xp-gets-a-boost-after-battle-royale-players-complained-that-leveling-up-was-too-slow-in-chapter-6-but-it-still-isnt-enough-to-make-up-for-the-nerf/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">XP</a> and <a href="https://www.polygon.com/gaming/483112/fortnite-battle-pass-price-increase" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">battle pass</a> changes players are riled up about that are probably more consequential. But the lack of player levels has upset the delicate, mostly imaginary social balance of my games. I miss the (imaginary) comfort of sticking to my highest-level squadmate, feeling shepherded through the mysteries and dangers of a new season. I miss the (again, imaginary) sense of responsibility I felt to low-level squadmates, whom I would feel duty-bound to defend. Now my squad is just a bunch of names, a level playing field of strangers. How do I sort us into a pecking order? Who do I prioritize? How do I tell myself a complex tale of heroes and newcomers banding together against the odds? Where do I find my narrative fulfillment?</p><p>&nbsp;Like I said, this is probably mostly a good thing. And, as someone who doesn’t play <em>Fortnite</em> as frequently as I used to, I have to admit I sort of appreciate there being less information on the screen, which over the seasons has become so cluttered with indicators and symbols that I mostly tune them out. Now I need to learn about my squadmates through their actions, rather than largely meaningless numbers next to their names. There’s probably a lesson in here somewhere. &nbsp;</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Today is Dragon Age Day, and BioWare is celebrating the yearly event with a few gifts for the community. To begin with, they have finally released the free Dragon Age: The Veilguard character creator as a standalone app available on all platforms. Fans had <a href="https://wccftech.com/dragon-age-the-veilguard-character-creator-might-be-released-ahead-of-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">requested</a> it before launch to get a head start on creating their characters, but the developers couldn't release it in time. It's now out there, though, and everyone will be able to download the character creation tool, make their characters, and then import them into the game.</p>
<p>BioWare also prepared a special image that collects some of the Rooks shared by the community from the game's launch to this day. The picture shows the great diversity available in the character creation tool.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/DA-Day-Final-RookMontage-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>There's more. Today, Dragon Age: The Veilguard is getting its fourth update, introducing a new tool to take photos of the game's cutscenes, over 20 bug fixes, and new Qunari complexions.&nbsp;For Dragon Age Day 2024, BioWare has also released a free armor, body paint, and nose blood smear based on Dragon Age II protagonist Hawke, the Champion of Kirkwall. Owners of Dragon Age: The Veilguard can find the new cosmetics in the Lighthouse after downloading Patch 4 and completing the mission 'The Singing Blade.' Check out a preview below.</p>

<p>BioWare has released a few infographics detailing some of the choices made by the players in Dragon Age: The Veilguard. For example, in the first real opportunity to choose the fate of a character, 42% left Mayor Julius of D'Meta's Crossing to drown in Blight, while 36% saved him. The remaining 22% banished him to the Grey Wardens. Notably, this option was only available to Grey Wardens Rooks, which partly explains the lower percentage. It's also by far the best option (and the one I picked in my playthrough) since Julius later has his own redemption by helping save a group of Grey Wardens in the Hossberg Wetlands.</p>

<p>In a couple of hours, to properly cap off Dragon Age Day, a few members of the development team will also participate in a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/dragonage/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Reddit AMA</a> (Ask Me Anything) session to answer questions from the community.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-age-the-veilguard-spoiler-deep-dive-directors-answer-all-our-questions-on-the-endings-the-gods-solas-and-more<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Spoiler warning: The below interview contains FULL SPOILERS for Dragon Age: The Veilguard. </strong></p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/12/04/da-day-banner-web-export-1733274457189.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Dragon Age: The Veilguard finally debuted this Halloween, concluding with an intense final act full of shocking twists and devastating consequences. Unsurprisingly, choice and consequence both ended up being integral threads in the fabric of the game. Whether it’s sacrificing one city to save another, deciding the future of the griffins, or, yes, choosing just what happens to our bald elven antagonist Solas, you’re making some pretty big moves on the continent of Thedas. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fans have been quick to theorize what we might expect in a potential Dragon Age 5, especially after the massive reveals we got in this installment of the series. While DA5 remains unconfirmed and Bioware currently has no plans to release <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bioware-no-dragon-age-the-veilguard-expansion-dlc-mass-effect-5"><u>DLC</u></a> for The Veilguard, questions linger about the future of Thedas now that the war with the elven gods has seemingly come to an end. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">With the dust settled, IGN sat down with Dragon Age Creative Director John Epler and Game Director Corinne Busche in a 45-minute conversation to dissect lore and talk spoilers for the conclusion of the game. This includes the chilling secret post-credit scene which features a group of sinister voices whispering their plans for the future of Thedas and, potentially, a future installment of the franchise. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/12/03/dragonageveilguard-blogroll-1730083217268-1733256679090.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Dragon Age: The Veilguard's directors answer all our burning questions. </figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Before we get started, I actually just got the </strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ot_NjdSgN6k&amp;ab_channel=IGN" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u><strong>secret post credit scene</strong></u></a><strong>. Ominous! What’s the role or the aim of these mysterious voices in influencing the events of Thedas?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Epler:</strong> These voices have been influencing events in very subtle, very light touch ways to get towards a specific outcome. As to what their ultimate goal is, we're not going to get into that quite yet. But the idea is that they've always been kind of in the background. They know how to say the right thing at the right time to nudge towards an outcome that they want. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It doesn't mean that any of these characters, any of the people shown in that ending don't have free will. They all still made their choices. Loghain still chose to betray Cailin because of his fear of what the Wardens were going to do. Bartrand still locked Varric and Hawke away in the Deep Roads because of greed. But who gave Bartrand the idea that this was the expedition worth taking? Who was the soldier in the room with Loghain who maybe just casually mentioned, "oh, I'm sure glad the Wardens are on our side this time”? No one's being pushed. No one's being forced to do anything, but [the voices] are very good at knowing the right person and finding that little place where they can, with a gentle nudge, shift events in their favor.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Busche:</strong> I like how you say that, John, because it's almost as if through their gentle nudgings, their whispers, they're just stoking those feelings and those desires or insecurities that these characters within the world already had. That was already within them.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Loghain, Bartrand, the magisters, and the Breach are the largest figures in these illustrations. Why them? Why, for example, Bartrand versus Meredith and Orsino? </strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Epler: </strong>Without getting into what maybe the future holds for them, their goal is to remove the elven gods from the table. Again, [the gods] are the most powerful forces on Thedas up to this point. And whatever [the voices’] plans may be, another powerful magical force on the table like that is going to pose some obstacles. And I think the other thing about the Executors, they're very risk averse. They've been playing the extremely long game because the one thing they don't want to do is leave any of their pieces in check. They're always going to go for the option that keeps them the furthest away from harm, while also advancing these goals.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The gods are a big unknown for them. No one really knew just until the Veilguard what was going to happen with them. So if you look back chronologically to Dragon Age: Origins, there's definitely a chain of events that leads from then to the gods being taken off the table. Solas' dagger is the red lyrium idol from the Deep Roads. Corypheus obviously had a big part to play in weakening the veil and setting events in motion. One thing that I think is fun to think about is Thedas has been around for a very long time, but these world ending events are happening with such incredible frequency all of a sudden. Why now? Why in this age, why this specific time? You start to get a sense of why that might be – not because anyone's going in and controlling kingdoms or taking over armies. Someone is seeing the end game coming and maybe they're setting up for it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Hopefully we get to see these voices explored a bit more in a potential Dragon Age 5?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Epler:</strong> Never say never.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>I know that some people were surprised to </strong><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/how-dragon-age-the-veilguard-grapples-with-the-series-wildly-expansive-lore-and-your-choices-in-it"><u><strong>let go of the Keep</strong></u></a><strong> this time around. Now that it's all said and done, are there more choices you wish you'd carried over or included?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Busche:</strong> The big thing for us is we wanted to make this story, every single choice you make, feel relevant to it. One thing that we could have stated more clearly or maybe alluded to more clearly in the game is the idea that just because these choices from the past library of games didn't necessarily impact this particular story, that doesn't mean they're gone. This is a chance for us to really key in to what matters with these events and what's happening in Northern Thedas. I do fully expect that these choices going clear back to Dragon Age Origins will again matter. So just wanted to be on record with that. Every one of your choices that people have made throughout their Dragon Age journey, those are still your choices. And if you've seen the secret 2D ending we talked about, some of these events being quite pertinent. It's easy to see how those choices can and will be relevant into the future.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>"Every one of your choices that people have made throughout their Dragon Age journey, those are still your choices."</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>The Veilguard is full of these massive lore reveals, which really started when we learned the truth of the elven gods in Trespasser. What were ways that the Evanuris itself changed in development between Inquisition and The Veilguard?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Epler</strong>: It’s funny because in reality there hasn't been a significant shift in how we perceive the Evanuris from the end of Trespasser to now. If you have the art book, if you look at some of the old visual designs from [Project] Joplin, we had this idea of this very clear distance between Elgar'nan and Ghilan'nain. Ghilan'nain is the mad scientist. She's in search of creating the perfect form. She's all about experimentation. Elgar'nan is much more the tyrant. One thing that I love about Elgar'nan – he spends a not inconsiderable amount of his magic power looking handsome, looking normal, because he's also incredibly vain. I think that speaks to his character. In Veilguard, he doesn't show up until Fire and Ice because one thing he is also extremely, extremely cautious. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Busche:</strong> One of the things that was really interesting in development, one of my favorite stories is we knew we were going to explore some of these themes through the regrets that the Veilguard witness together in the Lighthouse. When we actually saw those come together and we saw the potential of the Crossroads, that's when we decided, actually we want to go a little bit deeper and let people relive some of these moments through Solas' rebellion and even see Ghilan'nain before the full extent of the Blight, the corruption, the changes to her had taken shape. And I think it was just really an interesting sign that there was something there that captured our imagination as well and to be able to explain that and have players relive it was a really fun discovery.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Can you tell us about the fate of the other elven gods like Sylaise and June? Are these gods now mortal in the Fade after the defeat of their Archdemons, or were they weakened enough to die in their prison?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Epler: </strong>Yeah, I mean, so we haven't been super explicit about what happens when the gods die. In my mind, they're either dead or they're the closest thing to it. When a Warden kills an Archdemon, in Origins and DA2 and DAI, before the Gods are out in the world, there is part of that elven god's spirit that is bound to that dragon. It finds the nearest source of Blight. Now, if it's a darkspawn, a darkspawn has a direct connection to the Blight. There's enough energy there for it to rebuild a body, rebuild itself as an Archdemon. When it goes into a Warden, that connection is very different and what ends up happening is essentially the fragment of the God spirit and the fragment of the Warden annihilate each other. So nothing to go back to the god. So if they're there, they're a shadow of their former self. But obviously when Elgar'nan and Ghilan'nain come out, there's not that distance. There's not that need to use the Blight as essentially an in-between medium and they can just regain that fragment of their soul. They're now mortal, but they're just as powerful as they were before.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Busche:</strong> And this is part of a theme within The Veilguard. We're tackling some pretty big subject matter, some of the largest outstanding mysteries within Dragon Age lore. So we want to tie up some of those loose ends, give really satisfying answers, but we also want to leave the door open just a little bit. So questions like that, what happens to the rest of the gods? Those are themes that we want to be able to explore, but also be able to advance the franchise.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>We learned that the Tevinter Old Gods were just the dragon thralls of the elven gods. What are the implications for Tevinter here? Will this totally reshape how they understand their history and their culture?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Epler:</strong> There's going to be a lot of people seeking power in various ways through the process of rebuilding Thedas. Because again, no matter where you are in Thedas, the war against the gods had an impact. And I think speaking of Tevinter in particular, there are going to be those who feel that sharing the truth is going to be the best course for people. There are going to be people who are motivated to lie. There's going to be people who are seeking to be proclaimed the new prophets of the old Gods and saying that that person over there is liar. In a world with so many unreliable narrators, smart and savvy political operators can use that to their own benefit. And, I mean, Tevinter is rife with people who bluntly were maybe not openly on the side of the Venatori, but certainly wouldn't have been too upset if they'd won – they're going to have their own motivations.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Busche:</strong> It makes me think of the choice at the end of Bellara's arc, in fact, where you're literally taking this repository of ancient elven knowledge and choosing to share it, to make it known or not. At the time, that seems like perhaps an inconsequential decision for the moment, but when you look at the future of Thedas and what it means for the elven people, it's perhaps one of the biggest.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>After everything the team learns through Solas’ memories, Harding wonders if they’ve disproven the Maker exists. Is that the case? Or is the Maker, like the elven and Tevinter gods, real just not in the way that we think he is?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Epler: </strong>That's one mystery that I personally don't want to ever give a definitive answer to one way or the other. The moment you start to try to explain it or try to provide a definitive answer, I do think that takes some of the mystery out of the world. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>"What the Maker is to Andraste followers and what the Maker could be to everyone else could be two completely different things."</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">For what Harding’s saying, the question you asked: is the Maker what we think it is? Maybe, maybe not. There could be something completely different to what the Chantry is saying. I think that's one of those wells that we are always going to want to keep open because I do think it adds some interesting context. What the Maker is to Andraste followers and what the Maker could be to everyone else could be two completely different things.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Busche:</strong> I also love what it does, from a world building and storytelling perspective, to the power structures and then the more personal and intimate. For instance, there's a conversation where Rook and team are sitting around the table in the Lighthouse and Rook gets to lend their perspective: “I still believe,” or “I never believed,” or “maybe we did disprove it.” Those are questions of faith that I think are so interesting to character and world building. And then consider the power and political influence that the Chantry has. If these questions are raised, does that power go away? Well, I doubt it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Epler:</strong> In a world that's rebuilding, in a world that's just had these massive revelations occur, I can see people in the Chantry are probably going to use that as an opportunity to try to seize more power. The more we shy away from ever being a hundred percent clear, the more interesting stories we can tell there.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>The reveal that the first elves came from spirits is huge, obviously. Can you speak to that a bit? When do we see the shift from spirit-created elves to the elves we know today?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Epler:</strong> One interesting thing about that reveal actually is originally it was going to show up as part of Bellara's personal quest. That was going to be how Anaris was able to turn elves into demons so quickly and so easily, how he's able to start creating his army. We realized maybe putting a massive reveal that changes the state of an entire lineage of the world? Probably not something that needs to go directly in a personal quest. But yeah, I mean, it is a massive reveal, it does change a lot of their history.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">That's something that is the theme of opening these questions about where all these groups came from and what their origins are. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Busche:</strong> And I do personally really love what you just touched on there, John, which is the differences but also parallels behind the origins of each of the lineages. Taash's arc explores having dragon's fire in your veins. We know dwarves are the children of the Titans. They can hear the song of the Stone. Knowing now elves have their origins from spirits. Really fascinating parallels that, again, create some interesting storytelling possibilities.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Speaking of the Titans: we learn Solas effectively made them Tranquil. We've heard rumblings that the Rite of Tranquility can be reversed. Do you think that's something that could happen with the Titans?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Epler:</strong> I mean, in the fullness of time anything can happen. I will say that's one of those mysteries that we're probably going to keep close to the chest.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Have some of these reveals always been part of the history of Thedas? Or were certain things developed as part of The Veilguard?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Epler:</strong> It's a tricky question because I've been on since Origins, but I used to be in QA and Cinematic, so I wasn't as privy to the deep lore discussions back then. I will say since Trespasser, since Inquisition, these are all things that we've been talking about for at least that long. So it's part of the franchise for as long as I've been around on the lore side of things. But I mean, that's the thing, as we tell stories, as we start to figure out where we want the franchise to go, what we want to happen, ideas change. Another reason why I'm so hesitant to just drop lore into the world without a storytelling reason is sometimes something we thought we wanted to do we realize maybe isn't the most interesting way to handle that. And then we go back to the drawing board. The balancing act is always, you never want to have lied to the players, and you never want to outright contradict something you said before, but the beauty of unreliable narrators is you can twist the truth about 45 degrees to the left and do something interesting without ever contradicting your past self.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>"Since Trespasser, since Inquisition, these are all things that we've been talking about for at least that long."</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Busche:</strong> I will say that I think the simple answer is that both approaches are true. There are elements that were heading through to a pretty clear conclusion. There were some that were a little bit more mysterious, but some of the most fun that, at least for me we've had are those moments when you and I are looking at these follower arcs and the impact of the stories and conceiving of how does this tie together when we revisit some of these themes. So there is an intentionality about what we do going forward. And again, we don't want to share too much on that, but certainly it influenced some of our decisions and some of the reveals along the way.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Varric – may he rest in peace – reveals that Solas’ dagger is actually the infamous red lyrium idol. How was Solas able to restore it to its original form?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Epler:</strong> Would it surprise you to know it was another ritual? Solas does love his rituals.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Classic Solas.</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Epler:</strong> Yeah, so in the time between Trespasser and The Veilguard, Solas was able to cleanse the Blight from the dagger and restore it to its former shape. One of the reasons it was hidden in the idol was to <em>keep</em> it hidden. It's an incredibly powerful artifact. It's not the kind of thing you want falling into the hands of a Venatori magister or an Antaam. Obviously, at the end of DA2, Meredith tries to use it, turns it into a sword. We all know what happened there. Rest in...I would say rest in pieces Meredith because she's now a giant piece of red lyrium. But it is an artifact that is tremendously powerful. Only Solas knew how to make it its most powerful, which was the cleansed version of the dagger. As long as its red lyrium, it still has the Blight in it, which means you're always going to be susceptible to the whims and whispers of Blight. We saw it happen with Bartrand. It drove him completely mad. Even when Varric picks up the piece in DA2, he can still hear some of the whispers. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The Art of Dragon Age: The Veilguard - Preview Gallery</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">So for Solas, before he used this thing, he needed to make sure it was purified, it was cleansed. Obviously, the Evanuris made their own dagger out of red lyrium. They don't care, they're already blighted. It's all the same to them. But for Solas, it was a ritual that he had to do. We talk about the elves following Solas at the end of Trespasser. It's not said explicitly in the game, but one of the things they're helping do is getting this ritual ready so we could cleanse this dagger.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Busche: </strong>One of the interesting properties of the idol has always been how inherently malleable it is. That's something very unique to it that we absolutely wanted to lean into. What was so fun for us is there were theories we saw out there in the fandom YouTube videos about what was this idol? And indeed did Solas convert it to the dagger and a credit to those fans that figured it out. I don't know how they pieced it together, but cheers to them.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>I've always wondered what the idol is actually </strong><em><strong>to. </strong></em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Epler:</strong> Solas is a very nostalgic person. I'd say an idol to Mythal. It's his guilt, his regrets poured into this thing. Because, as Corinne said, it's malleable. That's the shape it took.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>The final act has choices with resounding consequences. Solas’ fate, for instance, can vary wildly. How did y'all land on the different endings for him? Will his fate affect future games?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Epler:</strong> I can't answer the second one yet. It was the three fantasies of dealing with Solas. We have Solavellans or people who like Solas, they want to redeem him. They think he needs to come back to the good side. At the end, we wanted to make sure that those players had that opportunity, especially Solavellans who wanted their Inquisitor to have that tragic embrace in eternity with Solas. We were very vague about what happens on the other side of that, but it was important to us to make sure that Solavellans had that opportunity. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>"There's just this acknowledgement of, yes, that's right, Solas. I was smarter than you, eat it."</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">I will say I was personally the one who really wanted an opportunity to punch out Solas. I was the big advocate for the fight ending way back when. I had it pictured as a big knockdown drag out fight where you and him basically fist fought. In my mind, it was very over the top. I think what we got was a better ending, but I wanted to make sure that the players who chose the option in Trespasser where they said “Solas, have I ever wanted to hear one of your big long explanations?” That's for them, that's their opportunity to say: "nope, Solas, you're the bad guy. I'm just going to beat the crap out of you. Here we go." </p><p data-cy="paragraph">I think outsmart is a very specific fantasy. Because here's this guy who's been kind of needling you the entire game, he's been kind of a little condescending. Even if you build a rapport, you can always tell he thinks he's just a little bit more clever, just a little bit smarter than you. So getting the opportunity to outsmart the Dread Wolf was something that we thought was important to allow players to do because what more satisfying way to deal with this smug jerk who's been in your head barking at you for the last 40 to 60 hours at the end where it matters the most, than to be the one who outsmarts him. It was important to give players that opportunity to pull one over on him. And I love the line he says at the end. Because in fight, obviously he goes off, he's screaming, he's frothing, he's angry. At the end of outsmart, he says, “And I have finally met my match.” There's just this acknowledgement of, yes, that's right, Solas. I was smarter than you, eat it. And yeah, I think there's just those three fantasies of dealing with it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Busche:</strong> Even in that moment, John, he still can't quite get over that little bit of smugness of how well he's taught you. And that one has to sting a little bit, that had to sting. I will absolutely confirm that in so many meetings, more than I can count, John would tell me about this fantasy of punching out Solas and that knockdown drag out fight.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Put 'em in the ring!</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Busche:</strong> And, look, as the resident Solavellan, that's appalling! I could never. I will say I absolutely love that there's two variants of the redeem ending as well, whether your Inquisitor romanced Solas or not. Very important to us that you could have that satisfying ending whether you were sympathetic to Solas, even if you know he was misguided. But, also, if you cried like I did at that epilogue slide at the end of Trespasser with the Solavellan romance we knew we needed to pay that off. And my goodness, that one matters to people. It was really intimidating to approach that with the weight and reverence it deserved.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I will say also, we didn't touch on the sacrifice ending. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Let's talk about it.</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Busche:</strong> Everybody dies. There's a moment there that I think is one of the most powerful, where you see Solas, your friends rushing up to help you and to try and stop Solas, and seeing him unleash his powers to turn people to stone on your companions, seeing them fall in that way, that sense of helplessness, that one really rips my heart out. It does.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>It's such a reminder that all of these events have always been on a knife’s edge. John, like you said, these world-ending events have happened with so much frequency. It's only been because of luck, in some cases, that a person has stopped it.</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Epler:</strong> Well, yeah, exactly. I mean, you had the Warden who happened to fetch the treaties. You had the Inquisitor who happened to be in the right place at the right time to get the mark instead of Corypheus. And I mean, that is ultimately, I think one of the, just kind of circling all the way back to the beginning. One of the characteristics of all the heroes is they act in unexpected ways, and that's how they're able to thwart the end of the world so many times in a row is they're just the right person, at the right place, at the right time. I think, yeah, the sacrifice ending is a great example of sometimes that luck can run out. You need luck and preparedness. One of the things we really wanted to emphasize with that ending is it's still a victory, but it's more of a pyrrhic victory than the other ones. You won, you stop the end of the world, but the example that you set kind of dies with you to some degree. There's a monument set up, but Thedas is going to be in a dark place at this point. I think it's an interesting way to look at that ending in particular.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>In the final act, there are two major companion choices. First, whether or not Neve and Bellara are blighted and captured by Elgar’nan. Second, perhaps the toughest choice: whether or not Harding or Davrin will lead a distraction team and, ultimately, die. Why these choices and why these companions?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Epler:</strong> So for Neve and Bellara. The two groups that have been the most directly affected by the gods up to this point are obviously the elves – it's their gods that are back – and Tevinter, Minrathous. You know, the Venatori have either fully seized power or have made some pretty big inroads in Minrathous, depending on which city you save. And the gods have come back and brought their dragons and proclaimed them as the gods of the Tevinter people. So both Bellara and Neve have a direct investment. Not that everyone else doesn't, but they have the most direct investment in stopping the gods at this point. We wanted to give you that choice between these two characters who, again, have a very personal score to settle with the gods and are both mages whereas Emmrich obviously wants to stop the end of the world, but doesn't have quite that same connection to the events that are going on. So those two made the most sense as to who would disable them. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The other thing is something that shows up in the visuals. Minrathous, Tevinter in general has always been kind of...there's echoes of ancient elven magic in everything to Tevinter and Minrathous does because it's meant as almost a cargo cult imitation of what the ancient elves were capable of. The ancient elves worked lyrium into their buildings, Tevinter uses gold and jewels because they don't have the capacity to work lyrium. So it made the most sense for them. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>"There are a lot of clues scattered throughout the game of how all these things may connect."</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">I'll say for the other choice, we knew Harding had to be one of them, and then we had to ask ourselves: we've got a fan favorite returning character from Inquisition. Who could possibly equal that in terms of making this difficult choice? It's like, well, Assan. Assan and Davrin. Davrin obviously has a direct link to this at this point because of Weisshaupt. He's got a very personal stake in it, and it made sense for the two of them to be the ones to be the choice to lead the distraction team, because again, we want to find those personal connections between the characters and the events that are going on. And, you know, the case of Harding, she has so much investment in this story because she's been living it since Inquisition. And then Davrin. Davrin's entire order just fell at the end of the previous act. He's going to have a real strong investment in stopping the guys too here.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Busche: </strong>One thing that's so interesting about that choice too, the Harding and Davrin choice is it actually presented some interesting complexity and some emotional investment we could tie into, which always makes for a more satisfying, I will say harder choice to make. I'll say in one of my playthroughs, Taash and Harding were in a relationship together and I happened to be romancing Davrin. Impossible. Impossible decision in that moment.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>I do have one last question. We hear during Taash's personal quest about this “coming storm.” Does that have anything to do with the voices across the sea? Is it something we're going to explore?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Epler:</strong> How do I put this? There are a lot of clues scattered throughout the game of how all these things may connect. I would say Taash's arc is obviously a good one, the end of Bellara's arc and some of the codex entries in Arlathan may be another place to start digging for clues. I'm a big fan of scattering a lot of little hints and seeing what people pick up.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Alyssa Mora is an Associate Syndication Editor at IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-age-the-veilguard-director-says-choices-going-back-to-origins-still-have-a-chance-to-impact-potential-sequels<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Going all the way back to Origins, your choices – and the consequences of those choices – have been a major part of Dragon Age history, with each player character making decisions that have massive implications on the world of Thedas. Did you have the old god baby with Morrigan in Origins? Did you side with the mages or templars in Dragon Age II? Did you drink from the Well of Sorrows in Inquisition? And, for the love of The Maker, <em>who did you smooch</em>?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In line with that theme, starting with Inquisition, you could actually import your world states from previous games via BioWare’s online database, The Keep. That means if you did have the old god baby with Morrigan, the kid could actually show up in Inquisition, along with many other little nods to your previous choices. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">But Dragon Age: The Veilguard <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-age-the-veilguard-will-allow-you-to-import-your-choices-from-previous-games-through-the-character-creator"><u>took a different approach</u></a> – instead of leaning on The Keep, BioWare instead allows you to recreate your protagonist from Dragon Age: Inquisition in the character creator and select certain decisions you made in Inquisition via tarot cards. However, the game offers only three world state decisions: whether or not you disbanded the Inquisition, whether you vowed to redeem Solas or stop him at any cost, and, of course, <em>who did you smooch</em> in Inquisition?</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/12/03/dragonage-storysofar-blogroll-1731090586531-1733255908828.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Your past choices still have the chance to impact potential Dragon Age sequels, says The Veilguard's game director. </figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking to us for our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/how-dragon-age-the-veilguard-grapples-with-the-series-wildly-expansive-lore-and-your-choices-in-it"><u>IGN First coverage back in September</u></a>, the BioWare team explained they wanted to focus on choices in The Veilguard that they could react to meaningfully. Still, that didn’t change the fact that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-age-the-veilguard-is-at-war-with-itself"><u>many fans were majorly disappointed</u></a> upon hearing about the limited options – especially given the fact that they only tie back to Inquisition, with no updates from Origins’ Hero of Ferelden or Dragon Age II’s Hawke.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">However, there’s a glimmer of good news for those hoping to see their previous choices reflected in future Dragon Age games, should BioWare decide to make another sequel. Game Director Corrine Busche and Creative Director John Epler recently sat down with IGN for a wide-ranging, spoiler-filled interview (<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-age-the-veilguard-spoiler-deep-dive-directors-answer-all-our-questions-on-the-endings-the-gods-solas-and-more">which you can read here</a>), where we asked if the team wished they had integrated any additional past decisions in The Veilguard. Here’s what Busche had to say:</p><blockquote>The big thing for us is we wanted to make this story, every single choice you make, feel relevant to it. One thing that we could have stated more clearly or maybe alluded to more clearly in the game is the idea that just because these choices from the past library of games didn't necessarily impact this particular story, that doesn't mean they're gone. This is a chance for us to really key in to what matters with these events and what's happening in Northern Thedas. I do fully expect that these choices going clear back to Dragon Age: Origins will again matter. So just wanted to be on record with that. Every one of your choices that people have made throughout their Dragon Age journey, those are still your choices. </blockquote><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Dragon Age: The Veilguard - 15 Exclusive Screenshots Taken Using Photo Mode</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">While that should be encouraging for fans hoping to see their choices reflected in Thedas’ future, the big caveat here is whether or not Dragon Age: The Veilguard will indeed end up getting a sequel, and that’s unclear as of yet. While it received <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-age-the-veilguard-review"><u>positive reviews</u></a> and became EA’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-age-the-veilguard-launch-beats-jedi-survivor-to-makes-it-eas-biggest-ever-single-player-game-on-steam"><u>biggest single-player game on Steam at launch</u></a>, an analyst recently told IGN that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-age-the-veilguard-faces-uphill-battle-to-match-inquisitions-launch-sales-says-analyst"><u>it faces an “uphill battle”</u></a> to match Inquisition’s launch sales. Plus, it was already a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/how-bioware-finally-got-dragon-age-to-the-finish-line-after-a-tumultuous-decade"><u>rocky enough journey to get to Dragon Age 4</u></a>, and BioWare has shifted its attention to Mass Effect 5 <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bioware-no-dragon-age-the-veilguard-expansion-dlc-mass-effect-5"><u>with no plans for The Veilguard DLC</u></a>. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Still, that’s not to say the end of The Veilguard didn’t hint at events from previous Dragon Age games and how they might come into play for potential future games. We asked Busche and Epler about that as well, but be warned: <strong>Full endgame spoilers for Dragon Age: The Veilguard to follow.</strong></p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>A Hint at What a Potential Dragon Age 5 Could Be About</strong></h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Curiously, The Veilguard has a “secret ending” that comes in the form of the post-credits scene, which you can only view once you find the three mysterious circles by solving a puzzle and completing a couple side quests (read IGN’s guide to getting the secret ending <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/dragon-age-the-veilguard/All_Endings"><u>here</u></a>). Or if you don’t feel like doing all that, don’t worry, you can just view it below:</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">While it begins with showing our baddies from The Veilguard – Elgar'nan, Ghilan'nain, and the Dread Wolf – we also get glimpses of events and characters that will be familiar to fans who played previous games, including depictions of Loghain, Meredith, Orsino, Bertrand, Corypheus, and Flemeth. Busche brought up this secret ending when talking about the potential of previous choices coming back into play, adding, “if you’ve seen the 2D ending we talked about, some of these events being quite pertinent, it’s easy to see how those choices can and will be relevant into the future.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But in addition to the more recognizable characters, that secret ending also shows off a mysterious group of masked figures who’ve clearly been pulling some strings. While only well-researched fans would likely guess that this group is The Executors – a shadowy organization that’s just been referenced here and there in things like a Dragon Age: Inquisition War Table mission – Epler talked a little bit about what their appearance might mean for the future of Thedas.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Without getting into what maybe the future holds for them, their goal is to remove the elven gods from the table,” Epler said. “Again, [the gods] are the most powerful forces on Thedas up to this point. And whatever [the voices’] plans may be, another powerful magical force on the table like that is going to pose some obstacles.” </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>"Someone is seeing the endgame coming and maybe they're setting up for it.”</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">“I think the other thing about the Executors, they're very risk averse,” he continued. “They've been playing the extremely long game because the one thing they don't want to do is leave any of their pieces in check. They're always going to go for the option that keeps them the furthest away from harm, while also advancing these goals.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Epler went on to point out that there’s a frequent chain of world-shattering events from Origins through the end of The Veilguard. “Why now? Why in this age, why this specific time?” he continued. “You start to get a sense of why that might be – not because anyone's going in and controlling kingdoms or taking over armies. Someone is seeing the endgame coming and maybe they're setting up for it.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">When pressed further if we might see more of the Executors’ plans in a potential Dragon Age 5, Epler responded, “never say never.” So, while it still seems clear that Dragon Age 5 hasn’t been officially greenlit as of yet, the creative team certainly has some plans for the future.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For more on the conclusion of The Veilguard and what it could mean for Dragon Age’s future, check out <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/dragon-age-the-veilguard/Ending_Explained"><u>our full ending explained</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Alex Stedman is a Senior News Editor with IGN, overseeing entertainment reporting.

BioWare has announced a standalone launch for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragon-age-the-veilguard-walkthrough-tips-and-tricks-guide">Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a>'s character creator, and detailed the game's next patch. 
</p>
<p>
Today is Dragon Age Day 2024, and BioWare has confirmed it will imminently release its impressive character creator for The Veilguard as a free download on PC, PlayStation and Xbox. 
</p>
<p>
Speaking from experience, you can lose a lot of time exploring the game's customisation options - and in particular <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragon-age-the-veilguards-impressive-hair-tech-was-built-on-the-heads-and-shoulders-of-ea-sports-fc">Dragon Age: The Veilguard's brilliant hair tech</a>. Of course, any completed character design can also be exported to the full game. Look out for it later today.

<p>
The Veilguard's upcoming Patch 4 will add a sprinkling of new features, including a tool to take photos within the game's cutscenes, extra Qunari complexions, and an array of bug fixes. 
</p>
<p>
Perhaps the coolest addition is a set of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dragon-age-ii">Dragon Age 2</a> armour, complete with body paint and nose blood, for your Rook to begin wearing.
