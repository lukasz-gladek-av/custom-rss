                <p>Persona 4 Revival was officially unveiled during the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/xbox-games-showcase-2025-all-the-biggest-announcements/2900-6656/" data-ref-id="2900-6656">Xbox Games Showcase</a> at <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/summer-game-fest-live-2025-all-the-biggest-announcements-and-games/2900-6648/" data-ref-id="2900-6648">Summer Game Fest 2025</a> today, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/report-persona-4-remake-to-be-announced-at-xbox-showcase/1100-6532183/">following several recent leaks</a>. Like last year's Persona 3 Reloaded, this new version of Persona 4 is a brand-new edition of the classic 2008 RPG by Atlus.</p><p>The announcement teaser is light on information, aside from confirming that it takes place in the quiet countryside town of Inaba away from the bustling metropolis of the other entries, with a few shots of its high school classrooms and the town's streets, with just a few seconds of the protagonist running through them. It of course won't be too long before he goes head-first into a strange mystery storyline, as he joins his friends to investigate seemingly unsolvable murders while harnessing the power of Personas to crack the case.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Persona 4 Revival - Teaser Trailer | Xbox Games Showcase 2025</p>
      </div>
<p>A remake of Persona 4 became the worst-kept secret in gaming, as prior to its announcement, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/persona-4-voice-actor-says-he-wasnt-invited-back-for-a-still-unannounced-remake/1100-6531861/">voice actor Yuri Lowenthal confirmed that he would not be reprising his role</a> as Yosuke Hanamura for the game. "For those who keep asking, no, I will not be returning as Yosuke for the Persona 4 remake," Lowenthal said in a since-deleted post on BlueSky. "I asked. Maybe I even begged, but they don’t want me to come back."</p><p>Other actors linked to the original game also mentioned that they wouldn't be back, and a domain registration linked to the game added more fuel to the fire. It is worth noting that an enhanced version of the original game, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/persona-4-golden-review-stay-golden/1900-6400482/">Persona 4 Golden</a>, is available right now in case you don't want to wait for the remake. First released for the PS Vita handheld in 2012, it was later ported to PC, Switch, Xbox, and PlayStation.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">As part of the Xbox Games Showcase, Activision announced Call of Duty: Black Ops 7. Didn't we just get a new Black Ops game in 2024? We did, and this will be the first time in franchise history that Activision is releasing Black Ops titles in consecutive years.</p><p dir="ltr">Black Ops 7 is being developed by Treyarch and Raven Software--the same lead co-developers as Black Ops 6--and takes place in the year 2035. That's more than 40 years after the events of Black Ops 6 and 10 years after the events of Black Ops 2.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uUo5gnaYB_w" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/uUo5gnaYB_w" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">Activision said the story in Black Ops 7 will be the "most mind-bending" ever, and that's saying something for a series known for its twists and turns.</p><p dir="ltr">In Black Ops 7, "the world is on the brink of chaos, ravaged by violent conflict and psychological warfare." David Mason and his team return to fight a "manipulative enemy who weaponizes fear above all else." The game will allow players to use "cutting-edge technology."</p><p dir="ltr">Black Ops 7 has a campaign mode that supports solo and co-op, along with multiplayer, of course. Black Ops 7 also brings back round-based Zombies.</p><p dir="ltr">So far, Activision has only released the cinematic teaser seen above, but the company said it will have more announcements to share in the weeks and months ahead. Activision Publishing boss Tyler Bahl said, "We're excited to give players a bit more time to enjoy all the live seasons and provide players more of what they want across Black Ops 6 and Warzone before we turn the page to Black Ops 7."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4508968-screenshot2025-06-08at2.13.34pm.png" data-ref-id="1300-4508968" data-ratio="0.55820476858345" data-width="713" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4508968-screenshot2025-06-08at2.13.34pm.png" data-ref-id="1300-4508968"></a><figcaption>Black Ops 7 is coming this year.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4508968-screenshot2025-06-08at2.13.34pm.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">The "full reveal" for Black Ops 7 is coming later this summer, but Activision didn't say when that might happen. Activision also didn't reveal a release date but confirmed the game is coming this year to Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, PS5, PS4, and PC (via the Xbox PC app, Steam, and Battle.net). Being a first-party title, Black Ops 7 is also coming to Game Pass Ultimate and PC Game Pass at launch. There was no mention of Black Ops 7 for Nintendo Switch 2, which is curious considering <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-signs-10-year-deal-to-bring-call-of-duty-to-nintendo-platforms/1100-6511660/">Microsoft and Nintendo have a decade-long Call of Duty deal.</a></p>

                <p>A pair of Final Fantasy games are coming to Xbox, and one of them is coming <em>extremely</em> soon. As announced during the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/xbox-games-showcase-2025-all-the-biggest-announcements/2900-6656/" data-ref-id="2900-6656">Xbox Games Showcase</a>, Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade is coming this winter. And the most recent numbered series entry, Final Fantasy XVI, is coming to Xbox today.</p><p>A brief trailer showed off both games back to back. An <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/06/08/final-fantasy-16-xbox-games-showcase/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">associated blog entry</a> noted that every mainline, single-player Final Fantasy game is coming to Xbox platforms, so that will surely include Final Fantasy VII Rebirth as well. No release date has been given for that second part of the Remake trilogy.</p><p>Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade is the full version of Remake, including the Yuffie-centered DLC that leads the story right into Rebirth. Final Fantasy XVI, meanwhile, is its own story following Clive Rosfield as he navigates global politics in a world where kingdoms have access to massive destructive summoned creatures called Eikons as their ultimate power.</p>

                <p>Don't Nod announced its next game, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/aphelion/" data-ref-id="5000-681581">Aphelion</a>, at the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/xbox-games-showcase-2025-all-the-biggest-announcements/2900-6656/" data-ref-id="2900-6656">Xbox Games Showcase</a>.</p><p>As seen in the announcement trailer, Aphelion sees you play as Ariane, an astronaut lost on the newly discovered ninth planet in our solar system (sorry Pluto) named Persephone. She's searching for Thomas, a fellow astronaut who got separated from her at the start of the game. The duo are surveying the plant to see whether it's habitable after humans mucked up Earth.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RZs_IthEb2s" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/RZs_IthEb2s" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>In terms of gameplay, not much is shown in the trailer. Presumably, the game will have a focus on story and choices like past Don't Nod titles, but the trailer suggests platforming (and falling) will be a regular part of the experience as well. The ending of the trailer teases some sort of alien or otherworldly element, likely one that's dangerous to both Ariane and Thomas--the description beneath the trailer describes "shifting realities."</p><p>Aphelion is set to launch for Xbox Series X|S, PS5, and PC in 2026.</p>

He's got a reputation for generally being a rancid little guy, so much so that InXile introduces him as "the pissed-off doll," but you can periodically wind him up, so to speak, to get the benefit of his vast array of crude insults as well, because why not.</p><p dir="ltr">Clockwork Revolution still has no release date. InXile says it's coming "in due time," and the doll followed that up by telling everyone who had questions to "piss off."</p><p dir="ltr">Clockwork Revolution takes place in a steampunk, Victorian-ish city ruled by an elite whose fashion sense still calls the 18th century home, and they keep the masses in check by controlling time. Uprisings, even those with high-tech weapons modified by belligerent robots, are quickly quelled by the elite's ability to turn back time. Then, a rebel--you--gets hold of a device that can also change time, and a new war begins. You can change time during battles to reload your weapon, alter a bullet's trajectory, or erase a mistake entirely. That's in addition to a diverse set of gadgets you can use in combat and personal skills that augment your character's development.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l421zRNnivo" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/l421zRNnivo" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">InXile also teased larger-scale changes such as altering the course of history and the story, and studio head Brian Fargo said in an <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/06/08/clockwork-revolution-gameplay-interview-xbox-games-showcase/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Xbox Wire interview</a> that Clockwork Revolution has "all the crunchy systems and reactivity you'd expect." Game director Chad Moore said player choice will transform "entire regions of the world" as well. It's a big world as well. While the debut trailer focused on a large metropolis, there's a whole network of towns, cities, and slums for you to explore.</p><p dir="ltr">Duke Pomphrey isn't just there for some quick, crass laughs, either. InXile said he can play a pivotal role in the story depending on the choices you make while exploring the city and its surrounding environments.</p>

                <p>Earlier this year, Rebel Wolves--the developer co-founded by The Witcher 3 director Konrad Tomaszkiewicz--unveiled its inaugural game, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/first-look-at-the-blood-of-dawnwalker-reveals-a-medieval-world-ruled-by-vampires/1100-6528789/" data-ref-id="1100-6528789">The Blood of Dawnwalker</a>. This title casts players into a medieval world ruled by vampires. But as the title character, Coen, players can fight back with vampire powers of their own as demonstrated in the newly released <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/xbox-games-showcase-2025-all-the-biggest-announcements/2900-6656/" data-ref-id="2900-6656">Xbox Games Showcase</a> trailer.</p><p>This action-RPG is set during the 14th century in a kingdom called Vale Sangora, two years after the vampires seized control. The arrival of Brencis and his vampire followers saved Coen and his plague-infected sister, Lunka, from execution. But their salvation has come at a high cost. The vampires now rule the kingdom with an iron fist, and Coen has been partially turned into a vampire himself.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> The Blood of Dawnwalker — Game Trailer | Trapped Between Two Worlds | Xbox Games Showcase 2025</p>
      </div>
<p>Coen's transformation is incomplete because of his silver poisoning. As a dawnwalker, he becomes human during the day and regains his vampire abilities at night. The trailer demonstrates some of the powers that come with Coen's vampire side, including the ability to walk up the side of a building and his enhanced strength. However, it doesn't seem like he retains the same powers during the day.</p><p>The Blood of Dawnwalker only gives Coen <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/witcher-3-directors-vampire-game-might-be-a-literal-time-suck/1100-6529556/" data-ref-id="1100-6529556">30 days and 30 nights</a> to save his family from a dire fate. Players have to choose how to spend that time, including selecting side missions and which allies to recruit against the vampires. Not everyone in Vale Sangora is against the regime, even if they have to pay a blood tax for their "protection."</p><p>Bandai Namco will release The Blood of Dawnwalker on Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 5, and PC in 2026.</p>

Set in 2035, more than 40 years after last year's <a href="https://gameinformer.com/product/call-of-duty-black-ops-6">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</a>, Black Ops 7 features a story campaign that can be played solo or in a squad with friends, reminiscent of 2015's <a href="https://gameinformer.com/games/call_of_duty_black_ops_iii/b/playstation4/archive/2015/11/05/call-of-duty-black-ops-iii-review-game-informer.aspx">Call of Duty: Black Ops 3</a>. Plus, it seemingly stars Milo Ventimiglia (<em>This Is Us, Heroes</em>) as the main protagonist.&nbsp;</p><p>Treyarch says Black Ops 7 is the "next evolution of Black Ops," and is the first-ever consecutive release within this subseries of Call of Duty. "The year is 2035 and the world is on the brink of chaos, ravaged by violent conflict and psychological warfare following the events of Black Ops 2 and Black Ops 6," a press release reads. "Wielding cutting-edge technology, David Mason and his team must fight back against a manipulative enemy who weaponized fear above all else."&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Check it out in the Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 reveal trailer for yourself below:&nbsp;</strong></p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dZdRDyYGoQg"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dZdRDyYGoQg" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>Black Ops 7 will feature a "thrilling and innovative" co-op campaign, a multiplayer experience packed with near-future weaponry, new maps, and more, and of course, another chapter in the round-based Zombies mode (set in the Dark Aether storyline, no less).&nbsp;</p><p>Treyarch says today's cinematic teaser is "only the beginning," with a full reveal of Black Ops 7 later this summer. In the meantime, it says players should look out for teases, clues, and surprises for more about the gam.&nbsp;</p><p>Black Ops 7 is scheduled for release this year on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC via Xbox PC, Battle.net, and Steam. It will be available on Game Pass Ultimate and PC Game Pass on day one.&nbsp;</p><p>In the meantime, read up on everything last year's <a href="https://gameinformer.com/product/call-of-duty-black-ops-6">Black Ops 6</a> offered Call of Duty players.&nbsp;</p><hr><p><em>Are you going to hop into Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 this year?

Luckily, there was still some time for the little things, as we got a reveal for a sequel to Planet of Lana. Check out the trailer below.</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pBSApS3A37U"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pBSApS3A37U" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>Subtitled "Children of the Leaf," Planet of Lana II looks to be a pretty reasonable sequel, bringing the first game's signature art style and gameplay to new environments to tell a new story. According to the YouTube description of the game's reveal trailer, this new game "doubles the size and scope of the original," which would make it a much more substantial package compared to Planet of Lana's modest four to five hour playtime.</p><p>While the game was announced during an Xbox specific event, <a href="https://x.com/wishfully_games/status/1931773708189766052?s=46">a post from developer Wishfully's X account</a> says the game will also be coming to PlayStation, Switch, and Steam.</p><p>We gave the first game a 7.75 out of 10, with reviewer Marcus Stewart criticizing its lackluster gameplay but praising its "gorgeous presentation." Here's hoping that the sequel brings more variation to the table.&nbsp;</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>However, the teaser trailer doesn't feature a release date or year, and it features a watermark that says it is "early development content," suggesting this remake could be quite a ways away from launch.

            <p>As is tradition, the Call of Duty series is returning once again for its annual dollop of guns and ammunition, and today Activision has announced Black Ops 7.</p>
<p>The next series entry is being helmed by Treyarch and Raven Software, with the developers promising the "most mind-bending" Black Ops release yet. It will all be set more than 40 years after the events of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/call-of-duty-2024">Black Ops 6</a>, with things all kicking off in the year 2035. And, I am sorry to say, it doesn't sound like things are looking too good for humanity.</p>
<p>"The world is on the brink of chaos, ravaged by violent conflict and psychological warfare," reads the official blurb. "Wielding cutting-edge technology, David Mason and his team must fight back against a manipulative enemy who weaponises fear above all else." You can check out the first teaser for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/call-of-duty-black-ops">Call of Duty: Black Ops</a> 7 below.</p>

<p>Black Ops 7 will be able to be played solo or with friends "in a thrilling and innovative" co-op campaign, while also having the series' "signature" multiplayer experience. This will include new maps and more from Zombies.</p>
<p>All in all, this next game will be "the full Call of Duty package", says series general manager Matt Cox, promising more details to come later this summer.</p>
<p>Tyler Bahl, head of Activision Publishing Marketing, added: "This is the first time we're staying within the Black Ops series with back-to-back releases, so we're excited to give players a bit more time to enjoy all the live seasons and provide players more of what they want across Black Ops 6 and Call of Duty: Warzone before we turn the page to Black Ops 7."</p>
<p>For now, we don't have a release date for Call of Duty: Black Ops 7, but when it does arrive it will be available across Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, PlayStation 5, PS4, and PC (no word on <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-launch-day-live">Switch 2</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-and-nintendo-sign-binding-10-year-agreement-for-call-of-duty">despite that Call of Duty deal Microsoft made with Nintendo a little while ago</a>). It will also debut on Game Pass Ultimate and PC Game Pass.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Just as I was starting to being able to walk by hedges again without getting terrible spider-based flashbacks, Obsidian has announced a sequel to its wonderful 2020 garden survival game, Grounded, and it's launching surprisingly soon.
</p>
<p>
Obsidian's original Grounded - in familiar Honey, I Shrunk the Kids fashion - saw its pre-teen protagonists meet the wrong end of a shrinking ray while out in their backyard. And it turns out gardens are scary places when you're only an inch or so high.
</p>
<p>
As for the upcoming Grounded 2, it's somehow contrived to do it all over again, meaning more outdoor survival, crafting, and base building as our protagonists battle creepy crawlies and more in a bid to grow big again.
</p>

<p>
The first major change up appears to be a shift in locations from the original's suburban backyard to a public park in the middle of town. And while the fundamentals of survival look familiar, we get whole bunch of terrifying new critters to deal with - including big, hairy caterpillars - along with new tools, such as the ability to mount insects and scurry around.
</p>
<p>
Best of all, Grounded 2 is almost upon us. It's launching for Xbox Series X/S and PC as an early access release on 29th July.

            <p>At today's Xbox Showcase, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a> revealed <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-xvi">Final Fantasy 16</a> is finally available right now on Xbox. Further, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-7-remake-review-a-faithful-remake-with-a-few-missteps-along-the-way">Final Fantasy 7 Remake</a> will also make its way to the platform this winter.</p>
<p>The Xbox release of Final Fantasy 16 comes two years after its release on PS5 as a console exclusive, before also arriving on PC last year. Final Fantasy 7 Remake, meanwhile, arrives five years after its original PS4 release, which was followed by its PS5 re-release, PC release, and the release of sequel Rebirth. </p>
<p>It's all part of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/square-enix-aggressively-pursuing-new-multiplatform-strategy-after-reports-ff7-rebirth-underperformed-on-playstation">Square Enix's multiplatform strategy</a> it began "aggressively pursuing" last year, in a move to "diversify earnings opportunities". But are these games arriving on Xbox too late?</p>

<p>Anecdotally, there have certainly been plenty of calls from Xbox players to have these games available on Microsoft's platform. And a wider release means wider access to games and more sales, so it certainly makes business sense. Their arrival at last has felt like an inevitability for some time - Final Fantasy 16 producer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-16-producer-wants-xbox-launch-but-cant-say-when-itll-happen">Naoki Yoshida even stated he was keen on an Xbox release</a>.</p>
<p>Yet Square Enix - and more specifically, the Final Fantasy series - has a storied history with both Sony and Nintendo, which is why these companies have been favoured in the past. Traditionally, Xbox hasn't sold well in Japan (arguably because it's an American product) and that in turn meant a lack of Japanese-made games - and crucially Japanese RPGs - on those consoles.</p>
<p>Yet Microsoft seems keen to change that perspective. Beyond the likes of Xbox 360-exclusive <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/lost-odyssey">Lost Odyssey</a> from Final Fantasy creator Hironobu Sakaguchi, the company has been flirting more and more with the Japanese market. Just last year, it had a livestream at the Tokyo Game Show where it announced Square Enix's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/square-enix-brings-mana-and-final-fantasy-pixel-remasters-to-xbox">Final Fantasy Pixel Remasters would at long last be arriving on Xbox consoles</a>. "Our partnership with Square Enix is stronger than ever," boasted Sarah Bond, president of Xbox, at the time.</p>
<p>And that followed the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-14-heading-to-xbox">addition of MMORPG Final Fantasy 14 to Xbox consoles</a>. This was announced in Las Vegas at the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-xiv-a-realm-reborn">Final Fantasy 14</a> Fan Fest, where Xbox boss Phil Spencer joined Yoshida on stage to reveal the news. Spencer described the partnership as a "seminal" moment.</p>
<figure>

<figcaption>Dawntrail was the first FF14 expansion released simultaneously on Xbox | <span>Image credit: <cite>Eurogamer / Square Enix</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Speaking to Eurogamer after the release of FF14 expansion Dawntrail, Yoshida said players had been "waiting a long time for the Xbox release" and that it had "a really strong response" with the community growing.</p>
<p>He continued: "With Final Fantasy 14 as an opportunity, we can take this opportunity to strengthen the community on Xbox towards the Final Fantasy franchise. I think this is where we would take more communication and work on establishing the community moving forward. And this is important, not for Final Fantasy 14, but, I would say, for Square Enix. With Final Fantasy 14's release on Xbox, Phil Spencer spent a lot of his time and a lot of effort and put in a lot of hard work into making it a reality. So we would like to make the best of that and further deepen the relationship with Xbox gamers moving forward."</p>
<p>Yoshida even acknowledged "the Final Fantasy fanbase on Xbox has reduced" following the release of Final Fantasy 15 back in 2016, considering later games haven't appeared on Xbox. That game remains the fastest-selling game in series history, and is its fifth highest-selling overall. Why? It's the only mainline game in the series to be released simultaneously on Xbox and PlayStation.</p>
<p>Indeed, it always comes down to money. While neither company has released direct numbers of Xbox players in Final Fantasy 14 or the Pixel Remasters, both games are regularly cited as having strong sales in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragon-quest-3-hd-2d-remake-exceeded-square-enix-expectations-but-game-sales-drop-overall">Square Enix's financial reports</a>. Their respective Xbox releases must at least have given some sort of boost. What's more, the response to Final Fantasy 16 and Final Fantasy 7 Remake on PC proves there is at least an audience for these games outside of PlayStation and Nintendo.</p>
<p>As such, there's no doubt releasing Final Fantasy 16 and Final Fantasy 7 Remake on Xbox will extend the sales tail of these games. There's certainly an audience for them and both Xbox and Square Enix seem keen to strengthen their working relationship in a bid to increase both profits and reputation.</p>
<p>But this news isn't quite a silver bullet to turn around Square Enix's fortunes of its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/square-enix-admits-final-fantasy-7-rebirth-and-final-fantasy-16-profits-did-not-meet-expectations">games not meeting expectations</a>. Instead, it's still playing catch up on possible sales. Really it should be taking inspiration from its biggest previous launches and go all-in on multiplatform support from the start. Bring on Final Fantasy 17.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>"The Outer Worlds 2 is the eagerly-awaited sequel to the award-winning, first-person sci-fi RPG from Obsidian Entertainment (just look at the exciting number of dashes in this sentence!)," reads the trailer's official blurb. "Time to clear your calendar – get ready for an action-packed adventure with a new crew, new weapons, and new enemies in a new colony! So much newness!</p>
<p>"As a daring and most likely good-looking Earth Directorate agent, you must uncover the source of devastating rifts threatening to destroy all of humanity.

		<p>Activision and Xbox finished off their showcase with the reveal of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/black-ops-7">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</a>, though you might initially have expected it to be a Heroes reboot as a video game as Milo Ventimiglia was front and centre.</p>
<p><iframe title="Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 - Official Teaser | Xbox Games Showcase 2025" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dZdRDyYGoQg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Of course, he’s not playing Peter Petrelli this time around, he’s playing David Mason, who’s leading the Black Ops team against a manipulative enemy who weaponizes fear above all else. The story is continuing the narrative threads set up within Black Ops 2 and Black Ops 6, and looks like it could be bridging the divide to some of the ultra-futuristic themes of Black Ops 3. Or maybe it’s an Inception cross-over?</p>
<p>Speaking of which, we had an absolutely fantastic time with Black Ops 6 last year. In <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/31/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-review/">our review we said</a>, “Modern Warfare had a great run, but Black Ops is now back on top in their ongoing sibling rivalry. Fluid character movement, high-tempo multiplayer, evolved Zombies co-op, and an incredible campaign come together in 2024’s most irresistible first person shooter.”</p>
<p>We’re once again seeing Activision going back-to-back with their Call of Duty sub-franchises, so there will be some trepidation for Black Ops 7. Modern Warfare 2 and 3 went back-to-back, and the latter really suffered for it, with a poor campaign and this unusual expansion to the multiplayer, instead of a fully new mode.</p>

<p>We said of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/11/15/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-3-2023-review/">Modern Warfare 3</a>,&nbsp;“Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 isn’t an outright bad game, but it’s also not a particularly good one. Taken on its own, it’s a slightly above average first person shooter with a poor campaign, but in context, you can see how hurried and limited in scope this game really is. The multiplayer is effectively a classic map pack, Zombies and Open Combat Missions are game modes built within the existing Warzone map, and the campaign’s pacing and story come up short. It all adds up to a lacklustre experience and even a sense that Call of Duty is at risk of losing its identity.”</p>
<p>So… let’s hope it’s good.</p>

		<p>Square Enix has finally deigned to bring the latest and greatest from the Final Fantasy franchise to Xbox. Final Fantasy VII Remake is in the works for Xbox Series X|S, but what’s this? Final Fantasy XVI is out on Xbox Series X|S today!</p>
<p>Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade is coming to Xbox this winter.</p>
<p><iframe title="FINAL FANTASY VII REMAKE INTERGRADE - Coming to Xbox | Xbox Games Showcase 2025" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yFNoIUEdsEI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>And as mentioned, Final Fantasy XVI is out for Xbox today!</p>
<p><iframe title="FINAL FANTASY XVI - Available on Xbox Series X|S and Xbox PC today | Xbox Games Showcase 2025" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vAaJXiew1t0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Final Fantasy XVI won&nbsp;our <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/12/29/game-of-the-year-2023-best-playstation-game-ps5-psvr2/">PlayStation Game of the Year for 2023</a>, so it’s well worth checking out.</p>

<p>“Final Fantasy XVI is very different to its predecessors. First and foremost, it’s a lot more grown up, with the sex, swearing and everything else that its muse, Game of Thrones, offers. Then there’s the set-piece Eikonic battles, where players duke it out as the Summons the franchise is famed for. It looks and sounds utterly spectacular.”</p>
<p>“This game is a must-play for all action-RPG fans who want something a little more grown up. It shines for its lore and its lack of exposition for the sake of it, with reams of backstory hidden just a button-press away, offering a flow that feels more natural than any other Final Fantasy game to date. Its characters are fantastic, and as you grow to love them, their moments of sacrifice hit in a way unfelt since the likes of Final Fantasy X.”</p>

<p><iframe title="Planet of Lana II: Children of the Leaf Announcement Trailer | Xbox Games Showcase 2025" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pBSApS3A37U?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Lana and Mui struck a firm and beloved bond in the first game and, with their home now saved, they’re off on a longer journey. Children of the Leaf is a major sequel that will double the original in size and scope, seemingly looking to introduce some combat mechanics, alongside the sneaking and outsmarting of those spider-bots?</p>
<p>I really enjoyed the original game, saying in <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/05/22/planet-of-lana-review/">our review</a>, “Planet of Lana looks and sounds as wonderful as its original reveal promised. While it doesn’t redefine the adventure platformer, the adorable partnership between Lana and Mui, the gorgeous art direction and sweeping soundtrack make this well worth experiencing.”</p>

			<p>Clockwork Revolution got a brand new trailer reveal during the Xbox Games Showcase 2025 event, where we saw plenty of gameplay, got some insight into the game's story, and overall got our biggest showcase of what the game will be yet.</p>
<p>What we didn't get though, was a release date. Instead, the trailer just ended with the message that the game will be out "<em>in due time</em>," before one of the game's characters that was introduced as "The Pissed-Off Doll" tells viewers to, "<em>piss off</em>."</p>
<p>Following the trailer's reveal, an <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/06/08/clockwork-revolution-gameplay-interview-xbox-games-showcase/">Xbox Wire post</a> interviewing members of the development team from inXile dove deeper into what the game is and what we can expect.</p>
<p>You play as Morgan Vanette, a member of the Rotten Row Hooligans gang who gets the chance to alter the future by remaking history by trying to stop Lady Ironwood from manipulating the world to bend to her will.</p>
<p><iframe title="Clockwork Revolution | Xbox Games Showcase 2025" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/l421zRNnivo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The last we heard regarding Clockwork Revolution's release date, it was rumored that the game would <a href="https://wccftech.com/clockwork-revolution-ace-combat-8-squadron-42-and-gearboxs-next-game-all-target-2025-launch-according-to-actors-resume/">launch sometime in 2025</a>. That could still be the case, but the fact that the release date wasn't presented here does at least bring up the idea that the game has been delayed into 2026.</p>
<p>Xbox wasn't shy of revealing release dates for <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-outer-worlds-2-launches-this-coming-october-on-ps5-xbox-series-x-s-and-pc/">other games</a> due out towards the end of the year. Hopefully we'll learn more about a release date for Clockwork Revolution soon.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/sgf-2025-tony-hawks-pro-skater-34-pc-hands-on-impressions/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p><span>When I was growing up, Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater was one of the few video games based on the X Games lineup that I could get into. Not even Dave Mirra or Shaun White’s video game offerings appealed to me the same way that trying to nail a 900 in-game felt. While most of my time was spent on the very first Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater, I enjoyed the third title in addition to the Underground titles later on for the PlayStation 2. Now, Activision and Iron Galaxy Games are bringing back the remaining PlayStation 1 entries into a new console generation, bringing something familiar to me while introducing an entire game of content I had never played before in Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3+4.&nbsp;</span></p>

<figure></figure>

<p><span>While the story modes are gone from the latter half of <a href="https://wccftech.com/tony-hawks-pro-skater-3-4-is-out-on-july-11-developed-by-iron-galaxy/">Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 3+4</a>, the collection offers more than just the chance at 120 seconds of greatness. Yes, the two-minute sessions are the core focus, but they can just as easily be extended out to three or four minutes or an endless run that tracks the highest combo. There are also a handful of gameplay mods and accessibility options that can help players nail some of those pro goals hidden away in each level (and once you finish the initial set, each level looks like it has five or six additional hidden objectives). Who knows, you might even be able to nail the snake run on Kona after all these years. And with Bam Margera back on the roster, I’ve yet to see if his shopping cart run is back in Alcatraz along with the other skater-specific Pro goals.</span></p>
<p><span>Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 3+4’s biggest change in the hands-on preview, beyond the obvious exclusion of the free-form career mode from THPS4, is backporting all the gameplay and mechanical changes from the fourth numbered entry back into THPS3. This means grind extensions, leveling out, and even skitching are all on the menu for Foundry and Airport. It consolidates the two numbered entries into a single launcher and menu, combining both games into a $49.99 package. Activision tipped us off about some of the other brand-new features coming to Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 3+4, including new modes like Photo Mode and HAWK, but also the ability to create custom goals in Create-a-Park. However, I wasn’t able to check all of these out, given our limited time to get hands-on.</span></p>

<figure></figure>

<p><span>Activision claims the soundtrack for Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 3+4 is returning in all its glory. However, during this brief hands-on session, they had us play through the game in their new Streamer Mode, replacing the licensed tracks with some royalty-free tracks that won’t get content ID’d if you upload footage of your million-point tricks on YouTube. The new tunes, while charming in their unique way, don’t hype the player up in the same way that Bodyjar and CKY did all those years ago.&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span>Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 3+4, much like the inaugural 1+2 collection, modernizes both titles into a two-minute speed run with a whole slew of challenges and Pro Goals as well as unlockables for each of the varied skaters to play as. Returning faces might not look the same as you remember (Bam Margera being the most noticeably different), while newcomers to the field of skateboarding from the past five years also join the roster. Activision gave us a sneak peek at some of their guest characters as well, including the already-announced Doom Slayer for owners of the Digital Deluxe Edition, as well as Michaelangelo (I’ll always remember this turtle with the extra A) from the more recent TMNT reboots. Iron Galaxy Games hasn’t stopped there, as they have also introduced a couple of new parks in over a decade for a Tony Hawk game.</span></p>

<figure></figure>

<p><span>In preparation for my thirty-minute hands-on session with Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 3+4, I got to watch one of their resident pros try to rack up ten million points on every level, and this time was at THPS3’s Airport. His Create-a-Skater with full stats was able to link escalator hops and other tricks together to create insane combo modifiers before even reaching the main concourse with the long grindable rails and flags to collect. I noticed that he kept on using Michaelangelo’s new Shell Spin trick to help keep his momentum and continue the combo in between rails instead of relying on manuals and reverts.</span></p>
<p><span>During my time watching this master of the Xbox controller, I did notice that the engine itself had a few oddities brought into it from Iron Galaxy Games’ transition of the engine with some objects colliding with the player far more frequently than one would anticipate and being able to jump up from a lower grind rail up fifteen feet to the rails above with a combination of air tricks and wall rides. These quirks were what kept me from seeing Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 3+4 as much of a 1:1 interpretation as the first duology, but at the same time, I feel players will quickly grasp the nuances and quirks of the engine as they compete on the leaderboards. While Vicarious Visions isn't handling this collection, Iron Galaxy Games did have a hand with the first pair of THPS titles as they handled the PC port.</span></p>
<p><span>While <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/tony-hawks-pro-skater-3-4">Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater 3+4</a> launches next month on July 11th, players won’t have to wait that long to get their hands on it. Microsoft is about to reveal during their Xbox Games Showcase that players who pre-order the game, as well as select Game Pass subscribers, will get access to the Foundry demo (which also includes THPS4’s College), allowing players to tackle the park with both Tony Hawk himself and newcomer/Olympic gold medalist Rayssa Leal. If you pre-ordered the Digital Deluxe Edition, the Doom Slayer is also playable in this demo.</span></p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/tony-hawk-pro-skater-34-once-again-captures-essence-of-skating-new-secret</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/tony-hawk-pro-skater-3-4-once-again-captures-the-essence-of-skating-new-secret-characters.1212246/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/tony-hawk-pro-skater-34-once-again-captures-essence-of-skating-new-secret<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>One of the first games I had on my PlayStation was <em>Tony Hawk Pro Skater 3</em>, it was purchased at a garage sale and was in French for some reason, but that never stopped me from having fun two minutes at a time. Ahead of the Xbox Summer Game Fest Showcase, I had a chance to sit down with the game for an hour and it feels like coming home.</p>

<p>During this time, I had free rein to explore each of the levels across <em>Tony Hawk Pro Skater 3</em> and <em>Tony Hawk Pro Skater 4.</em> Loading up the Foundry, I was amazed at how much had changed and how much was the same.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/tony-hawk-pro-skater-34-foundry-gameplay.jpg?itok=DYNZP3Y3 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/tony-hawk-pro-skater-34-foundry-gameplay.jpg?itok=SnYpCicc 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>I was amazed at the amount of detail put into the paint on the floor, the light shining in from high windows, sparks and fumes ejecting from various pipes, and just how much hotter that lava pit looked. There are even workers taking on tasks who will yell at you as you skate by them.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>Demo Available</strong><br>
By the time you're reading this article you should be aware that those who pre-order the game will immediately get access to a demo that includes Foundry from <em>THPS3</em> and College from <em>THPS4</em>, with playable skaters Tony Hawk and Rayssa Leal.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Skating the park was a dream. All of the same combo lines and hidden gaps but with all of the benefits of smooth modern-day controls.</p>

<h2>Starting With The Original</h2>

<p>Searching around a number of the maps there was a lot that was the same, but also differences. In talking to Kurt Tillmans, the Game Director, it was explained that when they started this project they received the original files for <em>THPS3</em> for the PlayStation 2 and worked from them.</p>

<p>If your experience with <em>Tony Hawk Pro Skater 3</em> is for the original PlayStation, like me, then expect some differences.</p>
<p><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed//KGO2l2BuVr0"></iframe></p>

<p>Tillmans also explained that when they were creating <em>THPS 3+4</em> they also looked into what kinds of <em>THPS </em>Mods were most popular to understand what fans of the original wanted in an improved title so that they could make sure to create something that everyone would want to play. This led to the inclusion of baggage claim portals at the end of Airport to take you back to the top of the level.</p>

<p>Another inclusion that I was happy to see where Pro Goals. These are five additional goals for each level that serves as a kind of 'New Game +.' For example the Sick Score of Alcatraz is 175,000, but the Platinum Score is 500,000. There are also additional difficulty goals like "Double Hellflip the Massive Crumbling Stairset."</p>

<p>It adds replayability outside of the different trick challenges to just head back into a level, and complete more objectives, or push yourself to complete an even higher score.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/tony-hawk-pro-skater-34-pro-goals.jpg?itok=Awp38RtO 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/tony-hawk-pro-skater-34-pro-goals.jpg?itok=ASAnkr1k 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h2>Secret Characters Galore - Cowabunga!</h2>

<p>Just as with any <em>Tony Hawk Pro Skater</em> title, this one comes with a number of additional secret characters. In the base game, you can create your own skater or pick from one of thirty professional skateboarders. In addition to that there are five additional secret characters.</p>

<p>For this demo, we were able to see Bam Margera, an empty space on the roster, Michelangelo from the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles (specifically the TMNT: Mutant Mayhem design), Doom Slayer, and a Revenant (also from Doom).</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"A potentially major omission from <em>Tony Hawk Pro Skater 3+4</em> had fans worried. Would Activision really leave one of the series' most beloved skaters behind?... nope" - Bam Margera's character bio</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Each of these characters also comes with special moves custom-tailored to them. The Doom Slayer and Revenant weren't playable, citing that a purchase of the Deluxe Edition would be required.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/tony-hawk-pro-skater-34-doom-slayer-secret-character.jpg?itok=nEbhgH09 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/tony-hawk-pro-skater-34-doom-slayer-secret-character.jpg?itok=qdc4gCJO 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Seeing that only Mikey was added to the title, I did ask whether there had been a specific reason to include one, and not all of the Turtles. Tillmans explained that when reviewing the Turtles while all of them have been shown to enjoy skateboarding, it was Mikey that had the "most Southern California vibe, so he fit the best"</p>

<h2>Create A Park Reaches A Whole New Level</h2>

<p>A very interesting piece of news to those who enjoy making your own <em>Tony Hawk Pro Skater</em> levels, in the level creator you can not only make and upload levels but there are a variety of added features and functionalities.</p>

<p>Some of the features added include turbo boost pads and musical notes, but there is also the ability to create goals for your custom parks.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/tony-hawk-pro-skater-34-pinball-level.jpg?itok=Mzs4jpWQ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/tony-hawk-pro-skater-34-pinball-level.jpg?itok=2iLYJwVQ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Pinball is one of the new levels added to Tony Hawk Pro Skater 3+4</figcaption></figure><p>You can create a set of score goals, single combo goals, put down SKATE or COMBO letters, and even have collectibles placed around the map to obtain. Tillmans did clarify that there's a "Mario Maker style validation system that you'll need to complete your goal to be able to upload it."</p>

<p>He did proudly add that all uploaded parks are cross platform so no matter where a park and the goals are made anyone from any version of <em>Tony Hawk Pro Skater 3+4</em> will be able to download and play it.</p>

<p>I'm incredibly excited to see what kinds of maps with goals players are able to make when this releases.</p>

<blockquote><p>Shrunk again, but the world is much larger. In this open-world, single-player or cooperative survival adventure, craft weapons and armor, build your base, and traverse the playground on your buggy. But something else is out there—and it hasn’t forgotten you.</p></blockquote>
<p>As seen in the trailer, you can fight bugs, pet bugs, ride bugs, build a base out of parts presumably at least in part gathered from the corpses of bugs, and do this all with mates. Maybe one of your mates is a bug. Maybe you're all bugs. It's fine. This is the garden. It's a great place to be a bug. Or an awful place I suppose if you're a smaller, prey-like bug. My heart goes out to those guys, consumed as they may be by the time it reaches them.</p>

<p>This is one of those trailers where it spends a lot of its running time recapping and celebrating the base game. Fair enough, honestly. I might not have completed The Great Circle yet, but I loved the 25 hours I did play of it. It's no mean feat to bring a beloved icon of cinema to life in a video game and make it feel both authentic and original at the same time. Take the victory lap, in other words.
</p>
<p>This also means I'm keen on DLC even without having finished my plate of the first one. There are <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/06/08/indiana-jones-great-circle-dlc-order-giants-xbox-games-showcase/">more details over on Xbox Wire</a>, for those who found the trailer lacking:
</p>
<blockquote>The Indiana Jones and the Great Circle: The Order of Giants DLC kicks off when Indy meets Father Ricci, a young priest in desperate need of assistance tracking down a mysterious artifact. What starts as a typical treasure hunt soon becomes a perilous expedition as Indiana uncovers the history of the Nephilim order.</blockquote>
<p>Your journey will take you into Rome, beyond the boundariies of Vatican City so thoroughly explored in the Great Circle. I hope we don't spend all of our time in sewers, though. We'll find out come September.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Of all the space exploration agencies to consult while making a videogame, perhaps the European Space Agency is the best bet. Dontnod, the makers of Life Is Strange, have teamed up with the organisation of euronauts to create a third-person action adventure about an astronaut struggling to survive after crash landing on an alien planet. It's called <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/aphelion">Aphelion</a>, and it'll be out sometime in 2026. Here's a trailer from the Xbox Games Showcase.</p>

<p>That's a lot of classic Uncharted-style hill-sliding and panic-leaping. For the less scientifically inclined, the "aphelion" is the point in a planet's orbit at which it's furthest from their star. It sounds dangerous. Travelling to other planets is an absolute peril, and I keep telling everyone to stop doing it. Look, there's even the growls of some off-screen alien creature at the trailer's end. Aliens love to stay off-screen, it's like their hobby.</p>
<p>I make fun, but Dontnod actually have good form at climbing and clambering, with Alice B calling their mountaineering game <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/jusant">Jusant</a> a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/jusant-review">"show don't tell masterpiece"</a>. So there's a chance this space adventure will turn out deec. We'll see.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
