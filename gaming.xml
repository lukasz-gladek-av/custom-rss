		<p>A couple of years ago, Neo Berlin 2087 was announced for PC and PS5 showing us a mix of detective thriller and some gunfights. Now, a new trailer has been released and it seems to show how many different games have been used as an influence. There seems to be a mix of Deus Ex, Call of Duty, various zombie games, and maybe a hint of Vanquish due to the character’s armour. Chuck in some other influences, like the Morpheus like character lifted from the Matrix too and you have Neo Berlin 2087.</p>
<p><iframe title="Neo Berlin 2087 - Gamescom 2025 Gameplay Trailer | PS5 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/i8B89MssneU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The description for Neo Berlin 2087 says,&nbsp;<em>“The game is set in Berlin, in the year 2087. Technological advancements and cyberization have divided society into a two class system, where the rich are ruling over the city while the poor are fighting for survival inside the slums and in the deadly wasteland outside the city walls. In a story about justice, friendship, love, guilt and betrayal, we combine the best elements of science fiction in a way that has never been experienced before.”</em></p>
<p>As you can see from the gameplay, the RPG switches constantly between first person perspective and third person perspective, which suggests players will be able to choose which view to use. There is a copious amount of bullet time gunfights, some sneaking in a dark tunnel, zombie like creatures chasing the main character, a crime scene to investigate, and some uncanny valley style facial animations on the characters. Elysium Studio was originally aiming to release Neo Berlin 2087 in 2024, but there is now currently no release date.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hardspace-shipbreaker-blackbird-acquires-ip</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/multiple-hardspace-shipbreaker-projects-in-development-as-blackbird-acquires-ip.1271019/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Blackbird Interactive has announced that it has acquired the full rights to the&nbsp;<em>Hardspace: Shipbreaker&nbsp;</em>IP from original publisher Focus Entertainment, and that "multiple" projects related to the property are currently in development.</p>

<p>Per <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1161580/view/836099892906557718" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">a post</a> on the game's Steam page, Blackbird Interactive now "fully owns and controls" the IP, and it's "going to become a core part" of the studio's business strategy in the future. If you've been hoping for followups to the game, this seems like pretty great news for you.</p>

<p>In fact, Blackbird says that "multiple&nbsp;<em>Hardspace&nbsp;</em>projects are already in development", and that while the studio isn't ready to share specifics for those projects yet, Blackbird is focused on making sure the next <i>Hardspace&nbsp;</i>games "expand on the original game in all the right ways".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/hardspace-shipbreaker-blackbird-buys-ip-explosion.jpg?itok=1bgGp4s_ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/hardspace-shipbreaker-blackbird-buys-ip-explosion.jpg?itok=13JVh8Vo 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Hardspace: Shipbreaker&nbsp;</em>now falls entirely under the purview of developer Blackbird Interactive.</figcaption></figure><p>In order to reflect Blackbird's ownership of the&nbsp;<em>Hardspace&nbsp;</em>IP,&nbsp;<em>Shipbreaker&nbsp;</em>will be getting a small update, mainly including things like "updated splash screens, logos, and privacy policies". If you spot an update for your game, now you know what it is.</p>

<p>Blackbird is quick to reassure players that this won't mean anything in terms of access for&nbsp;<em>Hardspace: Shipbreaker</em>; you'll still be able to play it if you own it on Steam or anywhere else.</p>

<p>If you want your say on how future&nbsp;<em>Hardspace&nbsp;</em>projects should go, as well as the chance to potentially playtest new games as and when those tests become available, Blackbird recommends you sign up for something it's calling the <a href="https://blackbirdinteractive.com/lynxpioneerprogram/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">LYNX Pioneer Program</a>.</p>

<p>The program will offer "exclusive playtests" of new <i>Hardspace&nbsp;</i>games, as well as "behind-the-scenes development updates" and "opportunities to help shape Blackbird Interactive's next generation of games".</p>




<p>According to Blackbird, the split with Focus Interactive isn't acrimonious. The studio thanks Focus for its "partnership and willingness" to work alongside Blackbird in order to transfer IP ownership smoothly.</p>

The smugglers have coin to trade for certain treasures--but some of it is risky cargo to haul across the high seas.</p><p>To start your dealings with the League, you'll first have to find them, tracking down one of the well-hidden and booby-trapped Smugglers' Hideouts scattered across the map. While the League has interest in more standard treasures including fine art and fine rum, their main focus is on explosive Black Powder Barrels--a risky cargo to be carrying on your ship.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6Reuq0Pgi5k" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/6Reuq0Pgi5k" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Once players have tracked down a Hideout, they'll be able to pick up Smugglers' Route Runs, delivering often-dangerous cargo from one point to another. Smugglers' Runs can also be picked up from a message in a bottle bearing the Smugglers' mark.</p><p>The League also has some valuable cargo unaccounted for, with Smugglers' Shipwrecks offering plentiful opportunities for enterprising pirates to plunder. Find missing cargo on the sea floor, washed up on beaches, or reclaim it from Skeleton Ships and return it to the League for a big reward.</p><p>This is just Act 1 of the new season, with more content including heists set to unlock as Act 2 and 3 follow throughout September and October.</p><p>The new season also includes a variety of new cosmetics available at the Pirate Emporium, with more able to be unlocked from the Plunder Pass. For the first time, players will be able to play with extra characters, with the new Pirate Profiles system allowing you to start from scratch with a new pirate--without wiping your current progress.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Diablo IV: Vessel of Hatred Review</p>
      </div>
<p>The Fell Council is also getting a rework--one member of the Council will be designated as Council Speaker each time you fight them, gaining enhanced abilities along with the title promotion. Players will also have the option of ignoring the Fell Council altogether and opting into a brand-new boss fight with Vizjerei Warlord Bartuc--formerly the Warlord of Blood, now the Warlord of Chaos. Players will have to spend Aether to fight Bartuc, but the punishing boss fight promises increased rewards if the party successfully defeats him.</p><p>While most of the Infernal Hordes rework provides more challenging fights for experienced players, Blizzard is also introducing a stripped-down, earlier-game version called Fleeting Hordes. The mode will be available in pre-Torment tiers, and will consist of four waves before facing off against two members of the Fell Council.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4550212-chaosmonsters.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4550212" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4550212-chaosmonsters.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4550212"></a><figcaption>Chaos Monsters</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4550212-chaosmonsters.jpeg"></figure><p><span>A new unique armor type called Chaos Armor is also being introduced in the next PTR, allowing players to harness the power of Chaos for themselves. Chaos Armor provides a more powerful version of existing unique items, but true to its name, Chaos items will only drop for an item slot other than the one the original item was intended for--unique boots may drop as gloves, for example, or an amulet as chest armor. The item shakeup will enable new builds, allowing players to combine affixes in ways that weren't previously possible.</span></p><p>All Diablo 4 players on PC can opt into the PTR through the Battle.net app--including Game Pass players, who can access the Battle.net client through the Xbox App. The Season 10 PTR will be open from August 19 to August 26.</p><p>Check out the <a href="https://news.blizzard.com/en-us/article/24224180/the-2-4-0-ptr-what-you-need-to-know" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">full list</a> of new content and patch notes for the 2.4.0 PTR below:</p><h2>Infernal Hordes Reborn</h2><p>The Infernal Hordes are hotter than ever; we’re dialing up the intensity on this incendiary mode.</p><p>Infernal Hordes refined</p><ul><li>We’ve done a significant re-work of Infernal Offerings revealed between each Wave. Our goal is to try to make all offerings feel valid as choices for you as you start to stack them to focus on your run.</li><li>We’re doing this by balancing existing offerings, changing the effects of some offerings, and adjusting base Monster populations.</li><li>At the start of the Infernal Hordes, you’ll now start with an Infernal Offering to immediately stoke the embers and breathe some fire into your run.</li></ul><h4>The Fell Council</h4><p>The Fell Council has had some promotions. When fighting them, one of their members will now be the designated Council Speaker, and gain enhanced abilities.</p><h4>Chaos Monsters</h4><p>Hell has unearthed a new monster family from deep its horrid maw. Born of smoke and brimstone, these Chaos Monsters provide a powerful shrine-like buff when killed.</p><h4>Chaos Waves</h4><p>Hellfire brews the dastardliest maladies. Within the Infernal Hordes, you’ll occasionally be offered the choice of a Chaos Wave within the Infernal Hordes from your Infernal Offerings. You can expect an amount of Chaos Waves offered relative to the Infernal Compass Tier each time you enter the Infernal Hordes.</p><p>Chaos Waves completely alter the upcoming wave, imbuing havoc and intense challenge. These waves will have significantly increased difficulty, but reward far more Aether should you be able to survive.</p><p>Chaos Waves will have many different combinations to discover and master. Dodge deadly projectiles from Chaos Rifts, slay a rampaging Hellwyrm, or hunt down erratic Aether Goblins. Chaos awaits!</p><h4>Fight Bartuc, the Warlord of Blood</h4><p>Rather than facing off against the Fell Council, you can choose to risk your hard-earned Aether and throw down against the insidious, reborn Bartuc to complete your Infernal Hordes run.</p><h4>The Fleeting Hordes</h4><p>We’re introducing a warming version of the Infernal Hordes to burn through earlier in your character journey.</p><p>In Pre-Torment Tiers, you’ll play this modified version of the Infernal Hordes to slay through before reaching Torment difficulties.</p><p>Fleeting Hordes will be 4 waves in total, with limited Infernal Offerings to keep the packs of vicious Goblins under control.</p><p>Upon completing the 4 waves, you’ll fight two Fell Council members before you can spend your hard-earned Aether for rewards.</p><hr><h2>Bartuc Beckons</h2><p>An infamous Vizjerei Warlord known for his acts of cruelty performed in the Mage Clan Wars, Bartuc’s perversion knows no bounds. He returns to Sanctuary with a new title, Warlord of Chaos.</p><ul><li>Each member of your party will need to spend Aether to fight the infamous Vizjerei, Bartuc who was once known as the Warlord of Blood. The first player who chooses sets the decision for the rest of the party.</li><li>Bartuc will harness Chaos Portals to shoot projectiles at your location, master his tactics and enter these Chaos Portals tactically to gain the upper hand.</li><li>Upon defeat, Bartuc’s rewards will appear on the ground, so you do not have to spend additional Aether to claim these spoils.</li></ul><hr><h2>Harness Entropy with Chaos Armor</h2><p>A new Unique Armor type—Chaos Armor—has entered Sanctuary.</p><ul><li>Chaos Armor is a more powerful version of existing Unique items that come with a diabolical twist. Chaos Armor are Unique items that appear as more powerful counterparts for other Item slots, leading to entirely new ways of dispensing carnage. Chaos Armor can appear for the following item slots:  <ul><li>Helm</li><li>Chest</li><li>Gloves</li><li>Pants</li><li>Boots</li></ul></li><li>Chaos Armor will only appear as an item fit for anything other than its original slot. For example, Flickerstep won’t have a Chaos Armor version in the Boots slot.</li><li>Chaos Unique Powers are also more potent than their normal counterpart, always appear at Maximum power, and have at least one Greater Affix.</li><li>Note: you won’t be able to equip the same Unique item between Chaos version and standard.</li></ul><p>For example, you could have Fists of Fate drop as a Helm instead of as Gloves, allowing you to equip a different set of Unique Gloves to compound those affixes in a combination that was previously unavailable.</p><p>The following Uniques will be available as Chaos Unique:</p><h4>General Uniques</h4><ul><li>Banished Lord’s Talisman</li><li>Crown of Lucion</li><li>Endurant Faith</li><li>Fists of Fate</li><li>Flickerstep</li><li>Godslayer Crown</li><li>Locran’s Talisman</li><li>Mother’s Embrace</li><li>Paingorger’s Gauntlets</li><li>X’fal’s Corroded Signet</li></ul><h4>Barbarian</h4><ul><li>Battle Trance</li><li>Gohr’s Devastating Grips</li><li>Hooves of the Mountain God</li><li>Mantle of Mountain’s Fury</li><li>Overkill</li><li>Rage of Harrogath</li><li>Ring of Red Furor</li><li>Ring of the Ravenous</li><li>Sabre of Tsasgal (New Unique)</li><li>Tuskhelm of Joritz the Mighty</li><li>Ugly Bastard Helm</li><li>Unbroken Chain</li></ul><h4>Druid</h4><ul><li>Airidah’s Inexorable Will</li><li>Earthbreaker</li><li>Fleshrender</li><li>Greatstaff of the Crone</li><li>Hunter’s Zenith</li><li>Kilt of Blackwing (New Unique)</li><li>Malefic Crescent</li><li>Mjolnic Ring</li><li>Rotting Lightbringer</li><li>Tempest Roar</li><li>The Basilisk</li><li>Vasily’s Prayer</li></ul><h4>Necromancer</h4><ul><li>Black River</li><li>Bloodless Scream</li><li>Deahtless Visage</li><li>Deathspeaker’s Pendant</li><li>Ebonpiercer</li><li>Gospel of the Devotee (New Unique)</li><li>Lidless Wall</li><li>Orphan Maker</li><li>Ring of Mendeln</li><li>Ring of the Sacrilegious Soul</li><li>The Hand of Naz</li><li>The Mortacrux</li><li>The Unmaker</li></ul><h4>Rogue</h4><ul><li>Beastfall Boots</li><li>Condemnation</li><li>Cowl of the Nameless</li><li>Deathmask of Nirmitruq</li><li>Grasp of Shadow</li><li>Orphan Maker (New Unique)</li><li>Pitfighter’s Gull</li><li>Saboteur’s Signet</li><li>Scoundrel’s Leathers</li><li>Shroud of Khanduras</li><li>Skyhunter</li><li>Word of Hakan</li></ul><h4>Sorcerer</h4><ul><li>Axial Conduit</li><li>Blue Rose</li><li>Esadora’s Overflowing Cameo</li><li>Flamescar</li><li>Fractured Winterglass</li><li>Galvanic Azurite (New Unique)</li><li>Ophidian Iris</li><li>Raiment of the Infinite</li><li>Staff of Endless Rage</li><li>Staff of Lam Esen</li><li>Starfall Coronet</li><li>Vox Omnium</li></ul><h4>Spiritborn</h4><ul><li>Balazan’s Maxtlatl</li><li>Band of First Breath</li><li>Harmony of Ebewaka</li><li>Hesha e Kesungi (New Unique)</li><li>Jacinth Shell</li><li>Loyalty’s Mantle</li><li>Peacemonger’s Signet</li><li>Ring of the Midday Hunt</li><li>Rod of Kepleke</li><li>Sunstained War-Crozier</li><li>Sepazontec</li><li>Wushe Nak Pa</li></ul><hr><h2>Seal Chaos Rifts</h2><ul><li>Chaos Rifts will appear in the open world of Sanctuary within Helltide.

                <p>Fans of old-school dungeon crawlers should get ready, because Black Lantern Collective and WildArts Games have set a release date for the new psychological horror game Caput Mortum. This slow-burn horror adventure will officially launch on Steam on August 27.</p><p>This game drops players into an abandoned alchemist's tower from the 16th century and forces them to find a way out while confronting "stomach-turning secrets" and "death-defying horrors" that have been locked away for ages. Forbidden knowledge will also be discovered, assuming the players' characters live long enough to use it. The monsters in this game won't show any mercy, but there may be options beyond battling the creators or sneaking past them. However, healing items will be limited, so combat may not be the preferred path. You can check out a new Caput Mortum trailer below.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Caput Mortum - Official Release Date Reveal Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>"Caput Mortum was inspired by my first time playing [From Software's] King's Field 4 and the anxiety that comes with getting familiar with a game’s control scheme in a hostile environment," said WildArts Games art director Gabriel B. Dufour. "I also took inspiration from Amnesia: The Dark Descent when thinking about the monster encounters and puzzles. I hope fans of these classic games find something familiar to love in Caput Mortum, but that doesn't mean there won’t be surprises."</p><p>There are three different control options for Caput Mortum on PC. Keyboard-only and keyboard with a mouse are available for veteran players. However, the recommended option from Black Lantern Collective and WildArts Games is to go with a controller to recreate the feeling of a classic dungeon-crawler. That option was modeled after the controls used in the original King's Field from 1994.</p><p>Caput Mortum's demo is currently available on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3555980/Caput_Mortum/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Steam</a> ahead of the game's launch on August 27.</p>

                <p>As you browse Steam, adding various titles to your wishlist in the hopes they get a deep discount during the next big sale, you might soon notice that the pages for these games have a different look to them. Valve has <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/groups/steamworks/announcements/detail/532106189043925406">announced a new update</a> in the Steam client beta that changes how game pages look, with two major changes, the first being that store pages will be a lot wider.</p><p dir="ltr">The whole game page is wider in general, but the carousel containing trailers and screenshots will be a good bit wider too, allowing for some bigger images and videos. Because the whole page will be wider, Valve notes that there's more room to describe a game's features, so alongside the visual change you might start to notice some pages having more information than you're used to.</p><p dir="ltr">Arguably the biggest change with this Steam store page refresh is the ability to upload video files in the page's description section. A lot of game pages currently use animated GIFs to give an in-motion look at specific features or sections to better illustrate what the included text might not be able to. The problem with GIFs is that they aren't always the best quality, so allowing for videos will potentially mean clearer looks at specific parts of the games that might not work for a trailer. As long as there are no major hiccups, it's possible we'll see these changes rolled out for everyone in a few weeks time.</p><p dir="ltr">This comes as part of broader changes to Steam's storefront. Last month, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/593110/view/500579345320904590" rel="nofollow ">Valve released a beta version of the Steam home page</a>, making categories and tags personalized to you, a refresh of the browse tab, and additions to the search panel that shows recent popular searches, recently viewed games, and more. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Some brand new gameplay footage for Ghost of Yotei showing Atsu using the yari, which is a spear, to take on a group of enemies on top of a bridge. This footage seems to come at a later point in the game, as the enemy soldiers are questioning Yari if she is her, which means her legend is already starting to spread through the land.</p>
<p><iframe title="Ghost of Yōtei - Yari Gameplay | PS5 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/98KGbwncmwk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>As you can see from the trailer, the yari gives Atsu a decent advantage from range allowing her to attack enemies without them getting close. The yari can also be used to close the gap too, with footage showing Atsu using the yari to launch a kick at an enemy allowing her to close the gap and strike them down. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/ghost-of-yotei">Ghost of Yōtei</a> is not a direct sequel to Jin Sakai’s story, but is instead jumping forward in time by a couple hundred years and to a new location. The game takes us from Tsushima to Set the Ezo region (modern day Hokkaido) around Mount Yôtei and in the year 1603.</p>
<p>Atsu’s story is a tale of revenge. A gang of outlaws known as the Yōtei Six killed Atsu’s family and left her for dead, pinned to a burning ginkgo tree. But she’s not dead, and instead spent the last sixteen years learning to fight, kill and hunt. Now she’s returning to her home to track down The Snake, The Oni, The Kitsune, The Spider, The Dragon, and Lord Saito one by one and seek vengeance.</p>

<p>Ghost of Yotei is due to be released on October 2nd for PS5.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>

<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pokemon_legends_arceus">Pokémon Legends: Arceus</a> isn’t a perfect game by any means, but that didn't stop it from syphoning all of my free time when it launched back in 2022. This was the first time in a while where I truly felt the desire to “catch 'em all”. While Arceus still borrowed a lot from the mainline games, it did enough to make the world of Pokémon feel fresh and alive in ways the franchise previously hadn’t for many players, including myself.</p>
<p>Legends: Arceus isn’t an open-world game, though the zones it offered still did a solid job of making me feel immersed in the environment. Not only would you find Pokémon walking around all over the place, you could sneak up on them and toss a ball without the need for a battle. This could backfire as a Pokémon might be alerted to your presence and lay the smackdown on you. Yeah, you - the trainer. There was a sense of danger and mystery that really couldn’t be found in any previous Pokémon games.</p>
<p>Now, even with all of my love for Legends: Arceus, I’ve been quite nervous to go hands-on with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pokemon-legends-z-a-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a>. This whole city vibe hasn’t really won me over with the gameplay footage we’ve been shown so far, and while I enjoyed Mega Evolutions when they were introduced in Digimo- I mean, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/3ds/pokemon_x_and_y">Pokémon X &amp; Y</a> back in 2013, they're not something I have any gripping nostalgia for either, so I wasn’t fussed either way to see their return. I rather enjoyed the turn-based battling of old that was used in Arceus, too, so was I going to like Legends: Z-A's real-time combat?</p>
<figure><a title="Pokemon Legends ZA" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/321ce94c420ac/pokemon-legends-za.large.jpg"></a><figcaption>What do you think is running through Totodile's head? — <em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Kindly, Nintendo and Pokémon gave us behind closed doors access to Pokémon Legends: Z-A on Switch 2 at <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/psa-2025-pokemon-world-championships-kicks-off-this-week-heres-what-you-can-expect">this year's Pokémon Worlds event</a>, and even though our brief 20-minute demo didn’t show their entire hand, I was able to get a better grasp on this new combat system and I truly think this might be the most fast paced and exciting Pocket Monsters game we’ve seen yet. Now please, Nintendo, let me play more of it soon.</p>
<p>The demo was broken up into two sections. The first part let me loose in a back alley Battle Zone, which tasked me with taking down as many trainers as I could lock eyes with. I hate confrontation, though, so I was thrilled to learn I could surprise and sneak-attack these trainers instead by moving cautiously and targeting their active Pokémon standing by their side. This first strike gives you a little advantage at the start of a battle and this also makes for a nice evolution of the stealth mechanics we saw in Arceus.</p>
<p>It’s this section where I got my first taste of the new combat. You have full control of your trainer during battle, can sprint and dodge at the press of a button, use items (more on that later), and by holding 'ZL' you’ll pull up a list of moves your active Pokémon can use. Each move can be used one after another and have their own cooldown meters.</p>

<p>While you can’t take full control of your own Pokémon’s movement, they will follow you around the battlefield, and dodging and timing your attacks just right will either save or cost your 'mon's HP. You have to make a lot of decisions on the fly as some attacks have longer animations and wind-ups than others, so spamming each attack once it's ready to be used again might not always be the right decision.</p>
<p>The second portion of my demo had me make chase with a Zygarde in doggo form. This section was a little too scripted and stilted for my liking, and it's here where I first noticed a little bit of pop-in in the background details. It's worth mentioning everything I played was buttery smooth otherwise at 60fps. But the design choice to set this game within a concrete jungle hasn't totally won me over yet. I loved the wide open vistas found in Arceus; watching the sun rise, seeing the color of the landscapes change was a delight. I'm worried I'll quickly grow bored of the damp, back street visuals over time, but I've not even scratched the surface of what Legends: Z-A has to offer to know if that's the case. Early on, though, it's nice to see that the game's textures and performance (at least on Switch 2) are a big step up from Legends: Arceus.</p>
<p>Oh yeah, that Zygarde I was chasing after! Right, where was it now? I turned a corner and before I knew it, Zygarde had tackled me and dragged me up to the rooftops and picked a fight for me with a wild Absol that had the power to Mega Evolve. Look, we're all fans of <a href="https://i.redd.it/i-was-obsessed-with-this-guy-in-the-mid-late-2000s-v0-tgkaqog730sd1.jpg?width=512&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=2ee9cc1bec63cff7edc2f8076c62dd1675df7609">"2006" Davey Havok</a>, but that's an Absol, Zygarde --- thanks for that! This part must take place pretty early on in the game, as I only had a Chikorita on my team, but thankfully a neighbouring Lucario joined up with me and taught me how to activate Mega Evolution.</p>

<p>When facing off against a Mega Evolved Pokémon, you’ll have to pick up these Mega Power pellets by dealing damage. With enough Power, a tap of the right stick will transform your active Pokémon into something greater, faster, and all around more powerful, so it’s important to take advantage of this as often as you can.</p>
<p>Even though this Absol battle was framed as a seemingly easy tutorial for Mega Evolution, I got through by the skin of my teeth. Lucario sprinting around with me, I had to make snap decisions offensively while I avoided projectile blasts from Absol and scooped up all of the Mega Power I could. It all felt, well, for a lack of a better word, <em>epic</em>. Sure, maybe if I had used some of those potions I had tucked away in my satchel earlier in the fight, I wouldn’t have had to worry so much, but without them it honestly was a better, fairer fight, and I’m glad I didn’t need to rely on them. There’s also a cooldown timer on items that you have to contend with, so you can’t just douse your Pokémon with multiple potions at once. All of this added up could make for a really fun and engaging multiplayer, but that hasn't been confirmed yet.</p>
<p>While I’m still trying to temper my excitement and expectations for the overall city exploration, I’m relieved to report the combat, from what I've played, feels like just the thing the series needs to take it into the next generation. I’ll always have a longing for the turn-based battles that have been prevalent for the last nearly-30 years, but there’s no questioning the fact that this series has needed some reinvention and this new real-time battle system has certainly captured my attention. Pokémon Legends: ZA may not be for everyone, but I think the hardcore fans will be pleased.</p>
<p>Maybe next time we go hands-on with the game we'll get to see that new Dragonite Mega Evolution in action, too.<br></p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/for-legends-z-a%E2%80%99s-battle-system-i-rewired-the-pok%C3%A9mon-part-of-my-brain.1270977/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Even if you’ve never played a <em>Pokémon</em> game before, you can probably figure out how the type chart works. Fire types are weak to water types, water is weak to grass, and grass is weak to fire. Type matchups are foundational to <em>Pokémon</em> battles, far before you get into the weeds of stats and strats. I’ve had the <em>Pokémon</em> type chart memorized for around 25 years.</p><p>That still didn’t stop me from making a rookie error in <em>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</em>. I panicked and sent out my Weedle against an NPC’s Pidgeotto, which it is very much weak to. It got one-shot, obviously.</p><p>It’s not that I <em>forgot</em> how type matchups worked. But the battle system in <em>Legends: Z-A</em> is very, very different from what I’m used to, at least with <em>Pokémon</em>. It’s the second entry in the <em>Legends</em> spinoff series, which began with 2022’s <em>Pokémon Legends: Arceus</em>, and while the <em>Legends</em> games are still RPGs like the main <em>Pokémon</em> games, they mechanically and structurally diverge a bit from the typical <em>Pokémon </em>formula. And <em>Z-A</em> takes it further than <em>Arceus</em> did: it’s the first <em>Pokémon </em>RPG to feature real-time battles instead of turn-based ones.</p><p>In the main series, you choose your actions turn by turn, taking time to think through the options — the right attack to use, whether to switch out for another pokémon, what the opponent might be planning — before locking something in and seeing how it plays out. In <em>Legends: Z-A</em>, on the other hand, you’re facing your opponent more directly. There’s no waiting for both opponents to lock in their actions for the turn; you just pick your pokémon’s move using one of the face buttons, and the move goes out.</p><p>It’s a big departure from nearly 30 years of <em>Pokémon </em>games<em>.</em> I’m used to thinking about <em>Pokémon</em> like a chess match, slowly and several steps ahead; in <em>Z-A</em>, I had to think about the same type matchups and stats and everything else, but quickly and on my feet. It took me some time to adjust.</p><p>The demo, which I played ahead of the 2025 Pokémon World Championships in Anaheim, California, was split into two parts lasting around 10 minutes each, both seemingly early in the game and heavily focused on the new battle system. In the first part, I tried my hand at the Z-A Royale, which had me battling NPC trainers around Lumiose City at night. In the second, I battled a Rogue Mega Absol, which felt like the <em>Pokémon</em> version of a classic 3D <em>Zelda </em>boss. In the second part of the demo, I started to get the hang of this style of battling, and what was at first a little overwhelming quickly became an alluring kind of challenge: rewiring the <em>Pokémon</em> part of my brain.</p><p>The first big change I had to contend with: since battle in <em>Z-A </em>is in real time, moves are on cooldown timers. You can’t just spam the one super-effective move you have over and over; you have to figure out what else you can do while you wait to use that attack again. Even against very low-level opponents, I found myself relying on status moves like Growl, which lowers the opposing pokémon’s attack stat, as a buffer while my other moves were on cooldown. This had the added bonus of allowing my pokémon to take more hits, buying me some time both for the cooldown and to think.</p><p>Using status moves like this isn’t unusual when playing the core <em>Pokémon </em>games at a high level, but it is <em>very </em>unusual against a run-of-the-mill Bellsprout early in the game. I didn’t have enough time in the demo to really play around with it, but I can see myself carefully selecting each pokémon’s moves to account for the cooldown, like ensuring I have Protect on more of my pokémon to block incoming attacks. In other <em>Pokémon</em> games, I’d absolutely teach my pokémon Protect if I was building a competitive team, but I would almost never do it just to play the main story.</p><div><p><cite>Image: The Pokémon Company</cite></p></div><p>It’s not that battles in <em>Legends: Z-A </em>are unforgiving. (I did get smoked by the Pidgeotto, but in my defense, it was also at least 10 levels higher than the pokémon on my team.) But after years and years of approaching every mainline <em>Pokémon</em> game the same way, operating at least a little bit on autopilot and muscle memory in the early game, it’s kind of an exciting challenge to have to look at <em>Pokémon </em>differently.</p><p>The battle against Rogue Mega Absol — a wild, rampaging Absol that can Mega Evolve on its own — was similar to the NPC battles in that way, but far more hands-on. Unlike in battles against other trainers, wild pokémon can damage both your pokémon and your character, so you have to physically dodge and move around the arena while selecting your pokémon’s moves, keeping an eye on everyone’s health, and juggling cooldowns. (Using items like Potions is also on a cooldown.) Landing hits on the Rogue Mega causes it to drop orbs of “Mega Energy,” which you have to run and pick up in order to charge up a gauge to Mega Evolve your own pokémon and deal more damage.</p><p>It’s even more to balance, but I didn’t find it overwhelming, somehow. In this case, I had a Lucario at my disposal, and it had super-effective moves while also resisting Absol’s attacks, which helped. Lucario already knew Protect, too, so I got to take advantage of the strategy I had just developed in the Z-A Royale. And it’s also a familiar style of boss battle in games more generally, even if it’s different for <em>Pokémon</em>. It was more involved and felt more dangerous than the trainer battles, but I felt competent at it relatively quickly (especially compared to the Pidgeotto incident).</p><p>Maybe it’s just a typical learning curve, and I’ll very quickly develop an updated kind of autopilot for the easier parts of <em>Z-A</em>. But I really did like having to think actively about <em>Pokémon </em>in a way that I usually save for competitive play. I hope the game can sustain that for longer than a demo, and that I’ll get to build on the <em>Pokémon </em>knowledge I’ve been amassing for years, rather than just passively flexing it.</p><p><sub><em>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</em> will be released for Nintendo Switch and Switch 2 on October 16th.</sub></p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6NjY1MTI2"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Kallie Plagge</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games/759788/pokemon-legends-z-a-battle-real-time-preview]]></content:encoded>

<p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 won’t be landing on Nintendo Switch 2 at launch, though that doesn’t mean the door is closed to the platform permanently, according to a new report.</p>



<p>Set to be officially revealed at Gamescom’s Opening Night Live, Black Ops 7 will launch in November, once again part of the Xbox Game Pass catalog, but Nintendo Switch 2 players will miss out initially.</p>



<p>Though the improved performance of the Switch 2 has opened the door for releases on the platform for the likes of Cyberpunk 2077 and Star Wars Outlaws, Black Ops 7 won’t be joining them in November.</p>



<h2 id="h-unclear-whether-activision-plans-black-ops-7-on-switch-2-in-future">Unclear Whether Activision Plans Black Ops 7 on Switch 2 in Future</h2>



<figure><figcaption>No arrival yet. Image via Activision</figcaption></figure>



<p>A new report from <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/non-call-of-duty-black-ops-7-ne-sera-pas-disponible-sur-la-nintendo-switch-2-a-sa-sortie-60383" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Dealabs</a> confirms that Black Ops 7 will not arrive on Switch 2 when it launches in November, instead landing on PC, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, PlayStation 4, and PlayStation 5.</p>



<p>Crucially, though, the report says it’s “unclear whether Activision plans a future port” to Switch 2 in the future, so it’s not known yet whether the door has been closed entirely for Switch 2. Earlier this year, Activision told <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/activision-says-its-working-with-nintendo-to-get-call-of-duty-on-switch-but-will-black-ops-7-be-on-switch-2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">IGN</a> they were “committed to getting the franchise on Switch.”</p>



<p>Nintendo has not had a Call of Duty game on its platform since the release of Call of Duty: Ghosts on the Wii U in 2013, and, if that barren run is to come to an end with Black Ops 7, players will have to wait a while longer after the release date.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/warhammer-40000-dawn-of-war-definitive-edition">Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War - Definitive Edition</a> is out now, and of course modders are already pushing it to its limits. But the way they’re doing it is a lot of fun — and is perhaps the closest we’ll get to seeing a Waaagh! visualized on-screen.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War is Relic Entertainment’s much-loved real-time strategy game set in Games Workshop’s grim dark sci-fi universe. It launched in 2004 and proved to be an entry point into the Warhammer 40,000 universe for a generation of PC gamers, while also pleasing existing fans with its authentic representation of the setting.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now, over 20 years later, Dawn of War returns in Definitive Edition form, and some of the modders who have spent years tinkering with the original are excitedly moving over to this new version to see what it's capable of.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Much of this early testing is being done by people involved with <a href="https://www.moddb.com/mods/unification-mod-dawn-of-war-soulstorm" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dawn of War’s wonderful Unification Mod</a>, which lets users seamlessly combine almost all community-created races. Within hours of Definitive Edition’s release this week, modders started seeing how many Ork Boyz they could spawn in-game before it crashes, because, well... what else would Ork Boyz do?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">One member of the Unification Discord, Gunnisson, led the charge by summoning Ork Boyz as soon as they got their hands on the Definitive Edition:</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/08/15/dow1-1755253840929.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Then, a progress update at nearly 1,000 Boyz spawned:</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/08/15/dow2-1755253930010.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Orks just like to gather in big groups. They're not sure why.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Over 3,000, and according to Gunnisson: "They're pathing through each other exceptionally well."</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/08/15/dow3-1755253991979.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">The Ork count kept on increasing, to the point where, after more than 10,000 Orks, Dawn of War hit single-digit frames per second and became unplayable. But it still ran! "I mean, 10,000+ models on screen, I call that a win for performance and stability," Gunnisson said.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/08/15/dow4-1755254170636.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Gunnisson was eventually able to make 47,504 Ork Boyz “before the game died.” It took over seven hours, <a href="https://discord.com/channels/809740820151664680/810173515197579375/1405787870962126953" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">they said</a>, while publishing the screenshot below: "At the end it was still chugging along at 10 seconds-per-frame."</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/08/15/image-1755252844682.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">That's a lot of Boyz. Image credit: Gunnisson / Discord.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"Performance is fantastic," Gunnisson added. "It took a lot of corpses to start impacting." Then: "I'm hyped to try some big matches."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This is a herculean effort, and for Warhammer 40,000 fans is about as close as we’ll get to a good old Waaagh! For the uninitiated, this is the name given to the wonderful moment when enough Orks gain enough collective momentum to launch devastating system-wide invasions. The Orks don’t really understand what’s going on or why it’s going on — they’re just happy they’re in a massive scrap — but for anyone on the receiving end, it’s bad news indeed.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In a post on <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/3556750/discussions/1/591779517900522091/?snr=1_5_9_" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Steam</a> to mark the release of the Definitive Edition, Relic thanked modders for helping to test the game ahead of launch.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We want to say a huge thank you to our community modders who we have been working with for many months,” Relic said. “They've put in a lot of work both in helping us to support legacy mods, and in readying their own mods for the Definitive Edition.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s exciting to imagine what modders will be able to do with the Definitive Edition in the coming years as they get to grips with the game. As Gunnisson suggested, massive battles involving tens of thousands of units may now be possible, if the game can stand up to it. Perhaps then we'll get truly lore accurate body counts.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN. Find him on Twitter at @wyp100.

            <p>The PC release of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stellar-blade-guides-tips-tricks-9430">Stellar Blade</a> has proven exceptionally popular, with developer Shift Up revealing impressive sales earlier this week in its latest financial report. But it's not only a huge win for the studio and publisher Sony, it's also exemplary of a booming games industry in South Korea seeking global expansion.</p>
<p>As announced by Shift Up, the PC version of Stellar Blade sold a million copies in its first three days on Steam, and now boasts over 3m sales on PC and console combined. Further, its peak concurrent player count on Steam sits at almost 200k - as per Shift Up's latest financial report, that's 2-5x higher than Sony's other flagship triple-A games (<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/ghost-of-tsushima">Ghost of Tsushima</a>, God of War, Spider-Man, to name three), making it the best-ever PC performance for a PS-exclusive IP launch. These are single-player games only, not including the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2-now-playstations-fastest-selling-game-ever">multiplayer and multi-platform success of Helldivers 2</a>.</p>
<p>"Following the PS5 success of Stellar Blade as a triple-A IP, Shift Up leveraged its unique strengths in optimisation, user experience, content enhancements, and market specific marketing to continue its success in the PC market - becoming a developer with proven hits across mobile, PC, and console," wrote the studio in its report. And that success is set to continue throughout the rest of the year.</p>

<p>The popularity of Stellar Blade parallels an explosion of Korean culture in general. K-pop bands are global phenomenons; K-dramas and reality shows are all over Netflix; Korean films are winning Oscars; and Sony Pictures Animation's KPop Demon Hunters film is <em>the </em>thing that's dominating everything right now. And it's happening in games, too.</p><p>Just this week alone there's been plenty of news about Korean games. On top of those Stellar Blade sales, there was the announcement of Woochi the Wayfarer from publisher Nexon, a single-player triple-A action game based on Korean mythology that's set for release on PC and consoles. With its basis in Korean culture, it could follow the sort of nationalistic success <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/black-myth-wukong">Black Myth: Wukong</a> received in China.</p>

<p>Then, along with those Stellar Blade figures, there's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/inzoi-is-releasing-on-ps5-in-the-first-half-of-2026-xbox-version-is-being-considered">Krafton's Sims-like Inzoi heading to PS5</a>, as well as the delay of Pearl Abyss' open-world adventure Crimson Desert that will now be released early next year "due to longer than expected timelines arising from schedule coordination and collaborations with multiple partners for offline distribution, voice-overs, console certification, and other launch preparations", according to the company's latest financial report (thanks <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2025/08/crimson-desert-delayed-to-q1-2026">Gematsu</a>).</p>
<p>This all follows the likes of Soulslike <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/lies-of-p-overture-difficulty-options">Lies of P celebrating the release of its DLC</a> earlier this summer; Nexon <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dave-the-diver-director-finally-ends-indie-debate-after-controversial-the-game-awards-2023-nomination">debating what indie means with its popular Dave the Diver</a> game, as well as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-first-descendant-developer-responds-to-claims-its-icons-are-too-similar-to-those-in-destiny-2">courting plagiarism concerns with its Destiny-esque shooter The First Descendent</a>; and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/playerunknowns-battlegrounds">PUBG</a> developer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tango-gameworks-and-hi-fi-rush-acquired-by-pubgs-krafton-following-microsofts-studio-closure-in-may">Krafton acquiring Hi-Fi Rush developer Tango Gameworks</a> to boost its action game output, while more recently <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/krafton-defends-itself-amidst-subnautica-2-fiasco-says-milestone-process-is-being-rigorously-managed">defending itself amid a Subnautica 2 lawsuit fiasco</a>.</p><p>In short, the Korean games industry appears to be thriving. Of course, the country has long had a history with games, but it's previously focused predominantly on mobile games and online games, not to mention its exceptional esports scene. Now, though, we're seeing a shift towards PC and console gaming, and single-player games too. Pearl Abyss following its MMORPG Black Desert with the single-player Crimson Desert is just one example.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/lies-of-p">Lies of P</a> director Choi Ji-won told Eurogamer back at the Game Developer Conference the studio's "primary focus from the concept of this game was to deliver a high quality, premium action game that is single-player," though he admitted he'd be <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/lies-of-p-to-remain-single-player-despite-refreshing-elden-ring-nightreign-says-director">open to a Nightreign-esque multiplayer game in future</a>.</p>
<p>"In the future, instead of pegging us into a certain genre, we want the fans to look at us and actually know what sort of unique components that we deliver that they look forward to," he added. "So they see our next work as a sort of projection of our trust and characters that we are building moving forward."</p>
<p>Speaking on the wider industry, Choi Ji-won said: "There are many talented and remarkable developers in Korea, and we are grateful for the opportunity that in, especially the action game [genre], our game perhaps provided a little more motivation to the already talented developers in Korea to craft their own experience in the genre."</p>
<figure>

<figcaption>Lies of P has challenged the dominance of FromSoftware's Souls games | <span>Image credit: <cite>Neowiz</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Why is it that action games in particular are proving popular? "I think action in general is very intuitive, it's primal," Choi Ji-won suggested. "It's pretty natural that the action genre is big and there are many games actually in it. Also East Asia has a long tradition of action related materials, so because of that I think it comes very naturally."</p><p>Now, the Korean industry is looking to go global. Speaking to Game Informer (via <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/korean-devs-report-a-burst-of-interest-in-single-player-console-and-pc-games">Game Developer</a>), Round8 Studio CEO Jason Park said there are a "fixed number of people" playing single-player games on console and PC in South Korea, a number that "won't change". That's why Lies of P was made with a global market in mind.</p>
<p>Shift Up CEO Kim Hyung-tae said only five percent of Stellar Blade's PS5 sales came from Korea, and console share isn't growing - that's why the PC release was so important. He added that mobile games are designed around monetisation so appeal to an older demographic. "That's continued for the past 20 years, and players have become older, so it's harder to acquire new and younger users," he said.</p>
<p>Niko Partners analyst Daniel Ahmad echoed these comments to Eurogamer. "The Korean video game market remained flat in 2024 with narrowed growth prospects," he said. "This has led Korean video game companies, who have typically excelled at developing live service MMORPGs at home, to explore new geographies, genres and business models including premium single player games for the global market."</p>
<p>What's more, Ahmad explained, the Korean government has doubled its investment from 2024 into domestic console game development, now allocated 15.5 billion won. "The success of titles such as Stellar Blade and Lies of P show this strategy is delivering results for Shift Up and Neowiz, respectively," he said.</p><p>"While the goal is primarily growth outside of Korea, the industry is also looking to fill gaps at home with titles in genres that can challenge the dominance of long standing MMO, MOBA and shooter games in the country. Korean video game companies have also stepped up investment efforts in global studios and developing markets, with the aim of building a publishing portfolio with global appeal."</p>
<p>Growth in Korea mirrors a similar surge in China, where the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/how-black-myth-wukong-has-changed-the-game-for-chinese-developers">success of Black Myth: Wukong has paved the way for other action-RPGs</a>, from Phantom Blade Zero, to Lost Soul Aside, Wuchang: Fallen Feathers, and Tides of Annihilation. Developers here have similarly moved from mobile to PC and console development, seeking global appeal. Phantom Blade Zero director "Soulframe" Liang described this shift to Eurogamer as akin to the "golden age of PlayStation 1 and 2".</p>
<p>Shift Up will <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stellar-blade-2-is-official-and-seemingly-not-too-far-away">follow up the success of Stellar Blade with a sequel</a>, set to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stellar-blade-2-better-story-than-stellar-blade">address issues with the lack of story in the first game</a>. Its next original game, currently known as Project Spirit, is in development for a release some time from 2027 onwards. Whether it can match Stellar Blade's success with increased competition from other Korean developers remains to be seen.</p>

            <p>EA have made a tweak to the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a> open beta's rush, and are keeping tabs on the situation in case it needs more balancing changes. This comes as some <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">FPS</a> folks and Battlefield vets have voiced their displeasure with the version of the mode that's debuted in this second weekend of beta action.</p>
<p>The biggest moans are related to size. Namely the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-open-beta-reveals-rush-is-limited-to-12v12-and-people-are-upset/1100-6533943/">amount of players on each side</a> in these revamped rush battles and the <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/fps/after-adding-yet-another-tiny-map-battlefield-6-players-are-rightfully-clowning-on-its-definition-of-all-out-warfare/">relatively small maps</a> they're being contested on. As you might imagine, those two elements being a bit titchier in scale than previous Battlefields has also had knock on effects for other aspects of the mode.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"We've just made a change to Rush: the MCOM timer is now reduced from 45 to 30 seconds to better the balance between attacking and defending players," the Battlefield Comms account bugled out across the socials this morning. "We’ll continue to monitor and are ready and able to make further balance adjustments." As of writing, no more tweaks have yet been forthcoming.</p>
<p>For those who don't speak field battler, M-COMs are the military communications stations that serve as rush's objectives, with the key being to blow them up or stop the other team from doing so, depending on whether you're attacking or defending. The timer's the amount of tick-tocking it takes any bombs you plant on these stations to go kaboom.</p><div>

</p></div>
<p>We'll see how much difference that makes, but the two aspects of the beta's rush matches <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1mpv4d9/what_is_this_garbage_called_rush/">drawing the most ire</a> from players who aren't merrily shooting away are the 12 vs 12 squad size limit and the smaller maps, which can't be easily fixed on the fly. The result's an experience that's not quite as expansive and vehicle-friendly in its chaos. At least in terms of the maps, Battlefield 6's devs have moved to reassure folks that larger ones do exist, with lead producer David Sirland <a href="https://x.com/tiggr_/status/1954994293934055475">tweeting</a> that folks complaining about the frenetic speed of beta matches will see that "tempo scales accordingly".</p>
<p>This is just a beta, so there's plenty of time for further changes to be made if EA reckon the unhappy voices represent a majority. Insert joke here about them probably being best of not rushing to judgement.</p>

<p>The biggest weekend in the Pokémon calendar is here with the World Championships 2025 taking place in Anaheim, which of course means a closing ceremony that could bring plenty of news. Here are all the details.</p>



<p>Pokémon is set for a big year in the next 12 months with the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-release-date-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">release of Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a> edging ever closer and 2026 marking the franchise’s 30th anniversary, which is expected to include the long-awaited release of Generation 10. Could we see some news and hints in Anaheim?</p>



<p>Whatever Pokémon has up its sleeves to showcase at the closing ceremony, you don’t want to miss it, so here’s everything you need to know.</p>



<h2 id="h-when-is-the-pokemon-world-championships-2025-closing-ceremony">When is the Pokémon World Championships 2025 Closing Ceremony?</h2>

<p><strong>The Pokémon</strong> <strong>World Championships 2025 Closing Ceremony takes place on Sunday, August 17. As the name implies, it brings the event in Anaheim to a close.</strong></p>



<p>Action in Anaheim for the Pokémon World Championships 2025 begins on Friday, marking the start of three days of action from the TCG, VGC, and everything else in between.</p>



<p>The closing ceremony in previous events has featured news about upcoming titles and releases, so it should not be missed by fans.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-time-is-the-pokemon-world-championships-2025-closing-ceremony">What Time is the Pokémon World Championships 2025 Closing Ceremony?</h2>



<p><strong>The Pokémon</strong> <strong>World Championships Closing Ceremony begins at 7:00 pm PDT, meaning a late night for anyone on the east coast of the United States or elsewhere in the world.</strong></p>



<p>It is expected to begin bang on schedule, though it could be delayed if any of the finals earlier in the day run longer than planned. </p>



<p>Here’s an easier way to see the start times for the closing ceremony in your timezone.</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th data-align="center">Time Zone</th><th data-align="center">Start Time</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-align="center">Pacific Time (PT)</td><td data-align="center">19:00</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Central Time (CT)</td><td data-align="center">21:00</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Eastern Time (ET)</td><td data-align="center">22:00</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">British Summer Time (BST)</td><td data-align="center">03:00 (Aug. 18)</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Australian Eastern Standard Time (AEST)</td><td data-align="center">12:00 (Aug. 18)</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<h2 id="h-how-to-watch-the-pokemon-world-championships-2025-closing-ceremony">How to Watch The Pokémon World Championships 2025 Closing Ceremony</h2>



<p><strong>The Closing Ceremony at the Pokémon</strong> <strong>World Championships 2025 will be broadcast live online through multiple platforms, including directly on the Pokémon</strong> <strong>website, on Twitch, and on YouTube.</strong></p>



<p>In our experience, <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/pokemon" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Twitch</a> is the best place to watch as the streams are slightly ahead of other platforms, so tune in here if you don’t want to see any spoilers. All the big announcements will also be shared on social media.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-to-expect-from-the-pokemon-world-championships-2025-closing-ceremony">What to Expect From The Pokémon World Championships 2025 Closing Ceremony</h2>



<p><strong>Previous announcements at the Pokémon World Championships Closing Ceremony</strong> <strong>have included details for upcoming releases across games and the physical TCG, as well as news on future World Championship events.</strong></p>



<p>The Closing Ceremony almost always announces the location of the following World Championships, though there will be no such reveal for 2026 as we already know the World Championships are heading to San Francisco next year. That announcement was made in Honolulu last year.</p>



<p>We could see more reveals for the Pokémon TCG, with last year revealing the return of Trainer’s Pokémon to the game, but all eyes will be cast towards Pokémon Legends: Z-A news. After the reveal of Mega Dragonite in the recent Pokémon Presents showcase, could we get another reveal?</p>



<p>The Closing Ceremony could also bring news of upcoming updates to existing live-service titles like Pokémon TCG Pocket, Pokémon Cafe Remix, and Pokémon EX Masters. Crucially, we could see more details of Pokémon Champions, which is set to be the formula used for future VGC events.</p>



<p>Pokémon does like to keep surprises up its sleeve, however, so it’s difficult to predict exactly what will be shown off.</p>

<p>McDonalds has ended part of the Pokémon promotion early in Japan after huge queues outside of its stores and immense food wastage.</p>



<p>Last weekend’s launch of the Pokémon promotion earned criticism from across the world, with scalpers buying up Happy Meals in bulk to receive the exclusive Pokémon cards in the distribution, and many then dumping the meals. </p>



<p>McDonalds sold out of the exclusive Pokémon cards within hours of the promotion starting, despite plans for the event to run for three days, and plans have now been updated for the upcoming week.</p>



<h2 id="h-mcdonalds-places-restrictions-on-happy-meal-purchases">McDonalds Places Restrictions on Happy Meal Purchases</h2>



<figure><figcaption>It’s over. Image via McDonalds</figcaption></figure>



<p>In a <a href="https://www.mcdonalds.co.jp/company/info/2025/0814a/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">statement</a>, McDonalds apologized to customers and store staff, along with announcing restrictions on purchasing Happy Meals that prohibit purchasing more than three per group. If four or more are ordered, “we will refuse your purchase and cancel the order.”</p>



<p>This weekend’s promotion will go ahead, though the big difference is there will not be any Pokémon cards and, instead, toys will be provided, which should result in a decreased demand for those looking for profit.</p>



<p>On the topic of scalpers specifically, McDonalds stated it “does not tolerate the purchase of Happy Meals for the purpose of resale, or the abandonment or disposal of food.”</p>



<p>This is not a problem unique to McDonalds, however, as the Pokémon hobby has become embroiled with supply problems due to high demand, with widespread videos of people purchasing products in mass to sell at inflated prices.</p>



<p>Pokémon has maximized its printing process to counteract this issue, but there is little evidence of results so far and, with the 30th anniversary of the franchise next year, demand could be higher than ever.</p>



<p>Are scalpers ruining the Pokémon hobby? Should McDonalds refuse to distribute Pokémon cards again? Let us know your thoughts in the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/threads/3311/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

<p>Three Who'sthis?</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Cast your mind back to 2022 and you might remember <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/dark_deity">Dark Deity</a>, the fantasy turn-based RPG that took more than a little inspiration from <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/fire_emblem_three_houses">Fire Emblem: Three Houses</a>. Fast forward to the present day and we have <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/dark_deity_2">Dark Deity 2</a>, the second entry in the series which looks just as tied to the Nintendo touchstone.</p>
<p>This one launched on PC earlier this year, but developer Sword and Axe and publisher Indie.io have announced that it will <em>also</em> be making its way to Switch on <strong>4th September</strong>, and we can't help but feel that it's a good fit.</p>
<p>As you might expect, the Fire Emblem ties are once again strong with this one. Taking place in the fictional, fantasy setting of Verroa, you'll control Gwyn, Riordian and 18 other playable characters on their quest to protect their land from the neighbouring Holy Asverellian Empire.</p>
<p>The action all takes place in a top-down, tactical style, reminiscent of the early Fire Emblem games, with one-on-one turn-based encounters zooming in on the hits in all their pixel art detail. It's a format we've seen many times before, but it doesn't make it any less cool.</p>
<p>This sequel boasts 45 classes for its 20 playable characters, with built-in randomisers and campaign customisers ensuring a decent level of replayability.</p>
<p>Here's a brief rundown of the game's set up and a handful of screenshots:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A quarter of a century has passed, as Irving and the Eternal Order carefully rebuilt Verroa to protect it against a future war. Their efforts will be put to the test far too soon as a new threat looms on the horizon. The neighboring Holy Asverellian Empire needs new lands to grow, and the fractious, fragile Verroa seems ripe for the taking. All that stands in its way is the Order and twenty scrappy heroes-to-be.</p>
<p>Take command of the Eternal Delegation, led by Irving’s descendants. Gwyn and Riordian will have to navigate the treacherous politics of Verroa, and weave a web of alliances to turn the tide of the coming war. Your decisions will determine the shape of these alliances and define your army. Coupled with the help of a giant pool of customizations, no two playthroughs will ever feel the same.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Dark Deity 2 is now available to pre-order on the North American <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/dark-deity-2-switch/">Switch eShop</a> (it doesn't appear to be live on the European variant at the time of writing) for <strong>$24.99</strong>. There's even a 20% pre-launch discount available for those who want to save a few bucks.</p>
<p>We had a perfectly good time with its predecessor back in 2022, stating in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/dark-deity">our review</a> that "Dark Deity delivers a convincing and essentially satisfying facsimile of GBA Fire Emblem, but perhaps fails to stand on its own two feet". Let's hope the sequel moves things in the right direction, eh?</p>

            <p>Wuchang: Fallen Feathers got its 1.5 Patch this week, bringing multiple quality-of-life improvements to the Soulslike, but also story and boss adjustments which appear to have been made to appease Chinese netizens.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2277560/view/498329191821869869">patch notes</a> list all the details, which include features like faster healing animations and adjustments to invincibility frames when Wuchang stands up. But buried in the margins is the nebulous line: "Added dialogs for some NPCs to complete some plots. We will further optimize the exhaustion animations in the future to improve the plot performance."</p>
<!--more-->
<p>As reported by <a href="https://kotaku.com/wuchang-fallen-feathers-1-5-changes-censorship-game-pass-steam-2000617865">Kotaku</a> and pointed out by <a href="https://x.com/manfightdragon/status/1955675217680105798">YouTuber Lance McDonald</a>, in practice this means that several key bosses, notably those associated with the Ming dynasty, no longer die after their bloodthirsty battles with Wuchang. Instead, they fall down in exhaustion and remain in the boss arena, occasionally offering up further dialogue if Wuchang speaks with them. In the case of famous general Zhao Yun, who existed during China's Three Kingdoms period hundreds of years before the Ming dynasty and shows up as a surprise NPC and boss, the fight is reframed as a "trial" by his immortal soul designed to test Wuchang.</p>
<p>With this change comes the additional fact that certain enemies associated with the Ming dynasty, such as peasant loyalists and imperial guards, are no longer hostile. This significantly alters the game's fourth region, Worship's Rise in Ruins, which was full of these guys. Suddenly, the vast majority of that level's foes are friendly, making it a cakewalk in comparison to its original stressful form.</p><p>These changes appear to have been made by developer Leenzee Games in response to critical voices from the Chinese internet which have lambasted the game since its release. According to these voices, the game paints the Ming dynasty (1368-1644 AD) in a poor light.</p>
<p>The Ming was the last dynasty led by ethnic Han Chinese, and the following Qing dynasty (1644-1912 AD) was ruled by the Manchu people. Wuchang: Fallen Feathers features a distinct lack of Manchu enemies, and instead several of the game's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/wuchang-fallen-feathers-bosses">24 bosses</a> include prominent real-world persons such as Zhu Youjian, the 17th and final ruler of the Ming who was known as the Chongzhen (meaning "auspicious") Emperor. In-game, Zhu Youjian shows up as a mutated draconic version of himself obsessed with immortality and maintaining the Ming dynasty at all cost. As of Patch 1.5, Wuchang can no longer permanently kill Zhu Youjian, and he's reframed as having been corrupted. Upon defeating him, it's hinted that he goes off into seclusion with his consort instead of dying permanently.</p>
<p>Player response to Patch 1.5 on the English-speaking internet has largely been negative, with commentators on one of Wuchang's two Subreddits reacting in surprise to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/WuchangFallenFeathers/comments/1mq3zti/wtf_is_that_shxt/">still-alive bosses</a> and pointing out the fact that their post-battle "exhausted" states seem <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/WuchangFallenFeathers/comments/1mqks1q/this_patch_makes_no_sense/">unfinished</a> (to be fair, the patch notes do state that these animations will be improved).</p>
<p>Amongst Chinese players, reception to Patch 1.5 has been mixed. Chinese-language Steam threads include discussions that Lenzee <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/2277560/discussions/0/599660817248455789/">caved to an overly vocal minority</a>, and suggestions that the game should give players the <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/2277560/discussions/0/664963107066518176/">choice of battling Ming enemies</a> rather than turning them into friendly NPCs.</p><p>Others have stressed that these alterations dilute the plot of Wuchang: Fallen Feathers, which is rooted in the Buddhist concept of samsara, or cyclical change - a theme that is demonstrated by both the titular heroine's motivations and the historical backdrop of the falling Ming dynasty. The <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/2277560/discussions/0/664963107066498868/">second response in this thread</a> puts it succinctly, stressing that the plot is about Wuchang letting go of her obsession with resurrecting her sister - a theme that is rendered moot by Zhu Youjian escaping death simply by virtue of being a Chinese emperor.</p>
<p>Personally, as someone who put 90 hours into Wuchang: Fallen Feathers for guides purposes and is half-Chinese (Taiwanese actually, but I won't get into that here), I feel that the original outcry was unjustified and came from a select group of players who subscribe to ideas of Han Chinese supremacy. That said, I'm not surprised that Leenzee made these changes. Entities in Mainland China need to be more beholden to social pressure and patriotism to survive, and Leenzee Games invited scrutiny by featuring real-world figures and literally making the game's Chinese title 明末, which can be translated as "Last days of the Ming". I suspect they had a particular vision in mind, and they've now deemed it necessary to compromise on that vision in order to survive. It's a shame, since the news of these tweaks has covered up the quality-of-life patch improvements that will make the game more enjoyable.</p>

              <p>Last weekend, Japanese McDonald’s outlets’ attempts to include packs of Pokémon cards in Happy Meals ended not only two days early, but <a href="https://kotaku.com/mcdonalds-pokemon-tcg-happy-meal-chaos-2000616843">in the complete chaos of miserable children and gross amounts of wasted food</a>. This weekend, the chain is trying again, but this time with toys instead of cards and far more strict rules in place.</p> <p>Originally intended to run August 9 to 11, the Japanese Happy Meal promotion was the annual event of including packs of&nbsp;<em>Pokémon TCG</em> cards, which always causes a lot of excitement, but rarely involves the police. This year, however, <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-prismatic-evolutions-surging-sparks-sold-1851738920">amidst the ongoing mass hysteria over the cards</a>, things immediately got wildly out of control. Scalpers rushed in to buy dozens of Happy Meals each, removed the cards to resell them, then dumped the food on the street. Just a few hours in to what should have been a three-day promotion, the entire thing had to be abandoned due to card stocks running out and the chaotic scenes in restaurants. <a href="https://www.mcdonalds.co.jp/company/info/2025/0809b/">McDonald’s quickly issued an apology</a> and said it was all cancelled.</p> <p>However, the company is trying again. This weekend’s promotion features Pokémon toys rather than cards, but seems no less likely to be the target of scalping assholes. Running from today, August 15 to 17, far stricter purchase restrictions have been put in place—so much so that it’ll suck for any family with four kids. Last weekend, the often ignored rules said no more than five Happy Meals could be bought per person. This time it’s no more than three meals per&nbsp;<em>group</em>. “If you order four or more sets,” <a href="https://www.mcdonalds.co.jp/company/info/2025/0814a/">says McDonald’s</a> (via machine translation), “we will refuse your purchase and cancel the order.” The same rules apply to deliveries.</p>

 <p>McD’s appears to recognize that this solution isn’t ideal. The statement says,</p> <blockquote><p>“We sincerely apologize for any inconvenience caused to customers who look forward to dining with their children, grandchildren, or friends due to these purchase restrictions. We will continue to review and improve these sales methods and measures, listening to the opinions of our customers and store staff.”</p></blockquote> <p>The one consolation is that the toys look like shit. Clearly things are so nuts right now that this might not have too big of an impact, but they look like the worst plastic tat, rather than a desirable plushie or similar.</p> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="ハッピーセット ポケモン「おうちリレー」篇" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2_xGYjr1W44?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p>However, it probably doesn’t help that the promotions are being all mysterious about one of the possible toys (surely Charizard) which will only encourage silliness. In a normal world, that sort of super-low-level gamble is a useful way of drawing people in and encouraging repeat purchases in the hope of getting the secret toy, but in the current situation it seems like more trouble than it’s worth!</p> <p>Good luck to all McDonald’s employees in Japan who almost definitely aren’t paid enough to put up with this.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Have you all been a bit hot and bothered this week? It’s yet another heatwave in the UK, so sun screen, sun glasses, breezy clothing and hydration have been the order of the week.</p>
<p>But there’s always games, as well. I’ve had two reviews on the go, for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/08/12/abyssus-review/">Abyssus</a> and Drag x Drive, both of which sadly missed their potential for very different reasons. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/08/13/drag-x-drive-review/">Drag x Drive</a> in particular missed a lot of the colourful Nintendo charm that you’d want, though the core wheelchair basketball is enjoyable.</p>

<p>Much more exciting is a trio of games that I played to experience some Gamescom previews before Gamescom, which I will be able to tell you all about next week… during Gamescom.</p>
<p><strong>Miguel</strong> was one of my Abyssus buddies, but alongside that co-op rogueliking, he played a bunch of&nbsp;Death Stranding 2: On the Beach, and a bit of his current gacha game favourites – Girls Frontline 2: Exilium and Zenless Zone Zero – &nbsp;and the “incredible” indie visual novel South Scrimshaw.</p>

<p>It’s also been a bit of Death Stranding for <strong>Gamoc</strong>, who joined that with some Super Smash Bros. Ultimate, and reviews of Sengoku Dynasty and Peglin for review.</p>
<p><strong>Aran</strong> has had the cosy indie game Tiny Bookshop on the go for a review, which “is letting me live my dream.” I never knew he wanted to be a travelling book seller, but there we go!</p>

<p><strong>Ade</strong> thoroughly enjoyed finishing his run through DOOM: The Dark Ages, but has had plenty more on the go. He’s been playing both Shinobi: Art of Vengeance and Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Tactical Takedown for review, but much more concerning for his time and finances, he and his son have got into Warhammer 40,000 lately. He’s boosting his understanding of the Grimdark future by playing through Space Marine 2 a few weeks back and has now moved on to the confusingly named Warhammer 40,000: Chaos Gate – Daemonhunters – “a terrific XCOM type game which is proving to be great fun!”</p>
<p>Tuffcub played some of the Battlefield 6 beta last weekend “which was fun”, and has been replaying Uncharted 4. “There’s a lot of cut scenes in that game aren’t there? Does seem to drag on playing it now…”</p>
<div role="listitem" aria-roledescription="message" data-qa-hover="true" data-qa="virtual-list-item" data-qa-unprocessed="false" data-qa-placeholder="false" id="message-list_1755246850.156659" tabindex="-1" aria-setsize="-1" data-item-key="1755246850.156659">
<p>Having joined me for a touch of Abyssus – “which was briney fun albeit with some toxic banter from the editor… and a lot of Terry turrets” – <strong>Steve</strong> has been struggling with some of the bosses in Wuchang: Fallen Feathers, and making a start on a Switch 2 game which he’ll tell you about in due course.</p>
</div>

<p>And finally, <strong>Dom’s</strong> popping off on holiday today, but has preceded this with a busy week of gaming that has included Story of Seasons: Grand Bazaar, Donkey Kong Bananza, Grounded 2,&nbsp;Is This Seat Taken?, and a spot of Madden too. What will he manage to play while he’s away?</p>
<p>But we’ll leave that question hanging in order to ask another. What have&nbsp;<em>you</em> played?</p>

That’s because the word Paladin was found in the name of a build uploaded to Blizzard’s servers (2.5.Xpaladin67961).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Paladin is one of the most popular classes from Diablo 2, so its arrival in Diablo 4, should it happen, would be celebrated by the game's community. Now, this may be <em>nothing</em> (and Diablo 4 fans are already joking that the Paladin will be added as a Mercenary rather than a new class), but a new class is expected from Diablo 4’s second expansion, and the Paladin would certainly be a crowd-pleaser.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">As Blizzard confirmed earlier this year, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/diablo-4s-next-expansion-after-vessel-of-hatred-wont-come-until-2026">Diablo 4’s next expansion was pushed out of 2025 and into 2026</a>.

Photos and videos posted to social media by outraged fans highlighted arguments among patrons over the scalping, and showed examples of huge food wastage, with the Happy Meals dumped by the side of the road or left in the restaurant uneaten. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The incident meant McDonald's ran out of its cards within hours of its three-day promotion going live, forcing the burger brand to apologise to Pokémon fans left empty-handed. And now, McDonald's has gone further — with new rules regarding the availability of Pokémon merchandise in Happy Meals applied from today.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"We deeply apologize to our customers who regularly use McDonald's restaurants, as well as to our store staff and many others for any inconvenience caused by the Happy Set Pokémon Card Campaign," McDonald's wrote in a new <a href="https://www.mcdonalds.co.jp/company/info/2025/0814a/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">statement</a> released this morning.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We will continue to release the Pokémon Happy Meals, which include five different toys, as scheduled from Friday, August 15. However, in light of the current situation, we will be implementing the following purchase restrictions for three days until Sunday, August 17th."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">These restrictions include a maximum purchase of three Happy Meals per group (this was previously higher, and per person). "If you order four or more," McDonald's now says, "we will refuse your purchase and cancel the order."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Furthermore, during this period, there may be restrictions on use at some stores and during certain hours," the chain continued. "We will not allow purchases from customers who do not follow the above rules and etiquette."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The biggest difference with the coming weekend's promotion, however, is that it no longer features Pokémon cards at all — just Pokémon toys. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/08/11/untitled-1-1754903573029.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">A Pokémon fan shows a collection of Happy Meal card packs, while food lies unopened and dumped.

However, it's unclear how the chain can and will be able to enforce this. Still, what's obvious is the brand has taken note of the social media outrage — and the disappointment among young Pokémon fans and families at not being able to get cards.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We sincerely apologize for any inconvenience caused to customers who look forward to dining with their children, grandchildren, or friends due to these purchase restrictions," McDonald's concluded. "We will continue to review and improve these sales methods and measures, listening to the opinions of our customers and store staff."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In other Pokémon news, last week <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-tcg-pocket-updated-with-new-card-art-following-ho-oh-plagiarism-controversy">The Pokémon Company replaced the art for its Lugia and Ho-Oh cards</a> which had fallen foul to claims they included fan designs.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

            <p>Sonic the Hedgehog isn't loved by everyone, but most people can agree that the music in his games is generally top-tier stuff. We expect the soundtrack to the upcoming Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds will be stellar, and Sega has released a brand new video that highlights six of the tunes in the game.</p>
<p>The video below, which runs for almost eight minutes, features a mix of six remixed tracks from CrossWorlds put together by Kanon Oguni!. These tracks from the official soundtrack are said to be inspired by courses in the game based on Sonic Unleashed, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/sonic-colours">Sonic Colors</a>, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/r-sa2-dc">Sonic Adventure 2</a>.</p>

<p>Blackbird revealed all of this via a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1161580/view/836099892906557718">Steam post</a>, writing that they've "reached an agreement with Focus Entertainment, our publishing partner, to reacquire full ownership of the Hardspace: Shipbreaker intellectual property". So, as you might expect, doing plenty of Hardspacey things is going to be a big part of the studio's plans going forwards.</p>

<p>To that end, they revealed here that "multiple Hardspace projects are already in development". "We're not ready to share any specifics yet, but rest assured we have paid close attention to your feedback and are laser-focused on ensuring this next generation of Hardspace expands on the original game in all the right ways," Blackbird added.</p>
<p>In the run up to releasing these new games, the studio aim to "grow the Hardspace community", urging folks to join the series' <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fdiscord.gg%2FYEcBqgHa">Discord server</a>, where breaking updates will be launched into your orbit whenever they're ready. You can also <a href="https://blackbirdinteractive.com/lynxpioneerprogram/">pre-register for the "LYNX Pioneer Program" via Blackbird's website</a>, if you fancy the chance to take part in early playtests and offer feedback on future Hardspace games. There's some other community stuff like contests and the chance to generally chat with devs included in that too.</p>
<p>Also, Hardspace: Shipbreaker itself will be getting a "small update" that'll mainly take care of housekeeping details to indicate the change in ownership, like revamping the privacy policies and splash screens.</p>
<p>Our Liam wrote the following about the game in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hardspace-shipbreaker-review-moreish-sci-fi-work-sim-sticks-the-landing">his review</a>:</p>
<blockquote>What a thrill, to exist on the sidelines. To look longingly out towards the stars and wonder what’s going on beyond your little corner of this expansive universe. To understand a society purely through its waste products. Hardspace: Shipbreaker is a truly marvellous thing to spend time within. I quite like being a background character, it turns out. Being the hero is overrated. If Shipbreaker has taught me anything it’s that the satisfaction of a hard day's work beats saving the universe every single time.</blockquote>
<p>There are also thoughts on it from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hardspace-shipbreaker-and-the-joy-of-doing-a-boring-spacejob-perfectly">Alice O</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/i-want-to-like-hardspace-shipbreaker-but-im-very-bad-at-it-and-it-makes-me-sad">Alice B</a>, if you're keen to fill your Alice quota.</p>

<p>With Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater slithering toward release, it’s the perfect time to learn about the differences between the remake and the original Snake Eater 3 title from over two decades ago.</p>



<p>Due to be released on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/metal-gear-solid-3-snake-eater-release-date-confirmed-during-state-of-play/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">August 28</a> on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S, Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater could revive the Metal Gear Solid franchise after a few years of dormancy following the disappointment of the last release, Metal Gear Solid Survive, in 2018.</p>



<p>If you’re looking for details on all the big differences between the original title and Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater, we’ve got you covered.</p>

<h3 id="h-no-kojima-amp-shinkawa-involved">No Kojima &amp; Shinkawa Involved</h3>



<p>One of the biggest points to note is that the original creator, <a href="https://www.kojimaproductions.jp/en" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Hideo Kojima</a>, and the original artist, Yoji Shinkawa, are not involved in the remake. However, the developer pledged to stay fully faithful to the original content.</p>



<p>While neither of the starring pair is on board, their original work will still shine through. With Kojima not on board, Konami’s internal studio, Konami Digital Entertainment, is developing the game, while Noriaki Okamura, producer of Metal Gear Survive and Metal Gear Solid: Portable Ops, and Yuji Korekado, creative producer of Metal Gear Solid V, are supervising.</p>



<p>Singaporean studio Virtuos also contributed to development.</p>



<h3 id="h-snake-vs-bomberman">Snake vs Bomberman</h3>



<p>While those on PlayStation and PC will be able to play through a remake of Snake vs. Monkey, a crossover with Sony’s Ape Escape that released with the original title, Xbox Series X|S players will have a brand new experience with a crossover with a Konami property, Bomberman.</p>



<p>Snake vs. Bomberman has been created entirely for the Xbox Series X|S version of the game, given that Sony probably wouldn’t want their Ape Escape franchise to feature on the rival platform. </p>



<h3 id="h-trophy-amp-achievement-changes">Trophy &amp; Achievement Changes</h3>



<p>Several changes have been made to the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-trophy-list-all-achievement-trophy-differences-in-remake/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Trophy and Achievement list</a> for Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater, marking one of the biggest differences for the game compared to the original. </p>



<p>Some Trophies have been removed entirely, while others have had their rarity changed. Others have been streamlined into a single Trophy or Achievement for achieving 100% of an objective, whereas previously they were broken down into separate objectives.</p>



<p>Minor adjustments include some changes to names and descriptions, though the core task remains the same.</p>



<h3 id="h-updated-graphics">Updated Graphics</h3>



<p>One of the biggest differences in Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater compared to the original title is updated graphics, which is a given considering the original game released over two decades ago.</p>



<p>Expect the graphics to be in-line with recent AAA titles, showcasing the beloved game in a new light. While there are these visual changes, the core story remains the same, and no major adjustments have been made on that front.</p>







<p><strong>Given the original title released over two decades ago, Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater is a must-play for anyone who adores the original title.</strong></p>



<p>Bringing the game into the modern generation provides the Metal Gear Solid franchise with an opportunity to attract new players, but those who are well-versed with the franchise will be crucial to the game’s success. If you want to see other Metal Gear Solid games receive a remaster, I’d highly recommend buying.</p>



<p>The good thing about a remake is you know what to expect with the story, so you won’t be disappointed or feel short-handed. Instead, use the game as a trip down memory lane to reminisce about your first experiences playing the original game.</p>
