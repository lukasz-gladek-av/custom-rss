            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dead-rising-deluxe-remaster-erotica-bonus<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Capcom has revealed that&nbsp;<em>Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster&nbsp;</em>won't give you any bonuses for taking "erotica" photos like the original did, so you can put away your paparazzo tendencies and try to be a proper photographer.</p>
<p>Per <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/dead-rising-deluxe-remaster-will-not-award-erotica-points-for-taking-crotch-and-cleavage-photos-like-original/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a report by Automaton Media</a> (which, in turn, cites a <a href="https://www.famitsu.com/article/202408/13749" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Famitsu article</a>), the "erotica" bonus, which was awarded for taking photos of things like female characters' cleavage, upskirt shots, and other sexually-charged images, won't be present in&nbsp;<em>Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster</em>.</p>
<p>As Automaton points out, there's a mission in the original&nbsp;<em>Dead Rising&nbsp;</em>that tasks you with taking such a photo, and if the bonus isn't present anymore, then it's likely that mission will be removed or altered.</p>

<p>Of course, we can rely on&nbsp;<em>Dead Rising</em>'s fanbase to be entirely reasonable and rational about this change. Right? We'll just have to wait and see, I suppose.</p>
<p>If you're unfamiliar with&nbsp;<em>Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster</em>, it's an upcoming remaster-come-remake of 2006's zombie-killing classic&nbsp;<em>Dead Rising</em>, which sees photojournalist Frank West exploring a zombie-infested shopping mall to find the perfect scoop.</p>
<p>The original game tasked Frank with rescuing a number of survivors throughout the mall, taking on colorful psychopaths as boss fights, and arming himself with a variety of novelty weapons in order to slaughter hordes of zombies.</p>

<p><em>Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster&nbsp;</em>is set to launch across PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dead-rising-deluxe-remaster-release-date-and-gameplay-info-revealed">on September 19th</a>, and a physical version of the game is also due to arrive for consoles on November 8th.

As I re-watch it in 2024 at 34 years old, the song reaches into my chest cavity and grabs my beating heart, urging it to quicken its pace and remember what it felt like to kiss a boy while that song played tinnily over a car radio.<br></p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196923" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Kotaku’s Hopes For Spyro The Dragon’s (Reported) Comeback" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="355" data-playlist="196923,196922,196918" data-current="196923"><div><p>Kotaku’s Hopes For Spyro The Dragon’s (Reported) Comeback</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196923/196923_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196923/196923_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196923/196923_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196923/196923_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/22494.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>I’m 16 again, and life stretches out before me full of passion and promise. Maybe one day I’ll be an It Girl living in New York City, and I’ll buck relationship trends to fall in love with a brooding, artistic young man with an impressively lush amount of chest hair. Maybe I’ll hand-sew my own dress based off of an expensive designer gown so I can wear something fabulous to a fancy Upper East Side party. Maybe I’ll go to college, get a degree, graduate without debt, and find a job that’ll afford me enough money to buy my own house. It’s all possible, right? Wrong.</p><h2 id="h1268"><a id=""></a><strong>Rewatching <em>Gossip Girl </em>in 2024</strong></h2><p><em>Gossip Girl</em>, based on the young adult novels of the same name by Cecily von Ziegesar, aired from 2007 to 2012 on what was then known as The CW (though you can watch all of it on streaming service Max right now). It straddled the 2008 financial crisis, but remained steadfastly embedded in the glorious excess of Manhattan’s elite. Now, it serves as a window into the world as it was back then, before the housing market collapse, the election of Barack Obama and subsequent conservative backlash, the reign of the iPhone, or the proliferation of social media. Watching it now is equal parts shocking and satisfying—it’s so unabashedly, awfully catty and controversial that I’m surprised it stayed on-air for as long as it did.<br></p><p>The aforementioned sweet, hopeful <em>Gossip Girl</em> moment comes just seconds after an attempted sexual assault by Bad Boy Chuck Bass (Ed Westwick, who had <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.vogue.com.au/celebrity/news/gossip-girls-ed-westwick-has-been-accused-of-sexual-assault-by-a-third-woman/news-story/fbe31c5065dd11693662d89be80d6d49&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.vogue.com.au/celebrity/news/gossip-girls-ed-westwick-has-been-accused-of-sexual-assault-by-a-third-woman/news-story/fbe31c5065dd11693662d89be80d6d49" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">sexual assault allegations levied against him</a></span> back in 2017) on Dan’s younger sister Jenny (Taylor Momsen), and right before Kristen Bell’s snarky Gossip Girl narrator reminds us that Serena will be aggressively bullied by Chuck and her former best friend Blair Waldorf (Leighton Meester) once school starts again on Monday. It embodies what makes <em>Gossip Girl</em> such a pristine snapshot of the aughts: the casual violence against women, the glorification of underage drinking and drug use, the brutal dashing of hopes and dreams, the material excess, the almost ceaseless needle-drops of your iTunes top 25 most played, the quick-witted, shrewdly sarcastic dialogue of disaffected teens. Nothing will shove you into a time capsule, hastily input “2007” into its console, and unceremoniously ship you back nearly 20 years more than <em>Gossip Girl</em>.<br></p><figure id="" data-id="9e64209f84e8569883f9352b6594315a" data-recommend-id="image://9e64209f84e8569883f9352b6594315a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Serena and Blair talk on the steps of the Met." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Serena and Blair talk on the steps of the Met." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->CW Network / Courtesy Everett Collection / Warner Bros.

There is a casual cruelty to <em>Gossip Girl</em> that defined so much media from that era, that helped create today’s internet culture in which horrible insults can be lobbed at you from any direction. After all, this is the same era in which emo music reigned supreme, music in which self-proclaimed sensitive boys demonized young women who didn’t love them, music that dominated my every day. Girls who grew up in the early aughts internalized these ideologies—slut-shaming, body-shaming, status-shaming, style-shaming—and carry them still today.<br></p><p>That’s why the 2021 <em>Gossip Girl</em> reboot was doomed to fail (and fail it did, after just two seasons, though at least it took a page out of the OG’s book and was largely shot on-location in NYC). It couldn’t recreate the cruelty of the original series without being “canceled,” and it couldn’t present a neutered version of what made the aughts show so popular without coming off toothless. Like a scientific phenomenon that can only be replicated under the most specific conditions, <em>Gossip Girl</em> could have only ever existed from 2007 to 2012.<br></p><p>I’m 34, sure, but just an hour with <em>Gossip Girl</em> transports me back into the body of my teenage self, bringing with it a surge of emotions and memories that crashes over me like a sewage-filled wave from the East River. But at least now when I watch it, I know for sure that Chuck Bass is a fucking scumbag, and that you should never wear a straw fedora with a cocktail dress. That’s growth. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>I have only one criticism of the "definitive, newly enhanced versions" of&nbsp;<a href="https://slayersclub.bethesda.net/en-US/article/doom-doomii-release-notes"><em>Doom&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Doom II</em></a> you can now pick up in a $10 package or as a free upgrade if you already owned one of those two games. My gripe is that it is entirely your own fault when you get hit by enemies.</p>
<p>On a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2280/DOOM__DOOM_II/?snr=1_7_7_151_150_1">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/doom-doom-ii/9p46m5jq2ptf">Xbox</a> X or S, or <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP1003-PPSA21444_00-OSIRIS2000000000">PlayStation</a> 5, you can play&nbsp;<em>Doom&nbsp;</em>at 120 fps at 4K. You are moving so ridiculously fast, speed-skating across those Marine bases and/or hellscapes, that the imps tossing fireballs at you feel like they're a parent gently coaxing their kid to catch a softball. Even the enemies with instant-hitting guns feel like they're winding up a tree sap cannon. The one time I died inside the first three levels of classic <em>Doom</em> was when I jet-walked right off a circular path and into an inescapable poison moat.</p>
<figure><figcaption><p>Does a flame thrower work against creatures that literally live in Hell? Only one way to find out.</p><p>Bethesda Game Studios</p></figcaption></figure>
<p>It's easy to recommend this newly packed-up and enhanced edition of these two first-person icons, released Thursday as part of QuakeCon. For one thing, it's being offered by Nightdive Studios, which has been turning out fan-favorite (and generally Ars-approved) remasters of games like <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/08/dark-forces-remaster-is-yet-another-all-timer-fps-coming-back-around/"><em>Dark Forces</em></a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/05/interview-how-system-shock-balanced-faithful-recreation-and-modern-design/"><em>System Shock</em></a>, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2021/10/quake-remaster-owners-should-go-download-its-free-next-gen-upgrade/"><em>Quake</em></a>, and <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/08/quake-ii-gets-a-remaster-for-pc-and-consoles-and-its-exactly-what-it-needs-to-be/"><em>Quake II</em></a>. For another, it's a real bundle, with both games, a huge number of classic add-on maps (including <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2018/12/john-romero-will-release-18-new-maps-for-dooms-25th-anniversary/">John Romero's&nbsp;<em>Sigil</em></a>), and an entirely new episode,&nbsp;<em>Legacy of Rust</em>, made by folks from Nightdive, id Software, and&nbsp;<em>Wolfenstein</em> auteurs MachineGames.</p>
<p>And then there's how playing these levels feels, which to me is as close as I can get to the caffeine-pulsing, speed-metal-blasting flow state I remember from much younger days. I've installed&nbsp;<em>Doom</em> and played a few levels now and then, but this is the first time I've made plans to keep going after the first session. After sprinting through a well-trod Hell, I'll be eager to keep going in <em>Legacy of Rust</em>, where I saw quite a few cool design tricks in just a couple levels. Further along, new weapons await me, and I am eager to pick them up.</p>                                                                        
                                                                                
<figure><p><iframe type="text/html" width="980" height="550" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-4-xswoPRpo?start=0&amp;wmode=transparent" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><figcaption><p><em>Doom + Doom II</em> release trailer.</p></figcaption></figure>
<h2>Wonderful, optional options</h2>
<p>It helps that this version incorporates the rearranged, real-instruments "IDKFA" soundtrack from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Hulshult">Andrew Hulshult</a>, first <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AGK1dr-Ql0w">made available in 2016</a> and now officially putting some heavy crunch into the classic tunes, along with some new <em>Doom II</em> tracks. It deserves its place in this official package, because it rips. As with almost everything else, the upgrade is optional—you can stick with MIDI if you like.</p>
<p>There are lots of accessibility options now—high-contrast text, text-to-speech in chat, and more—along with quality-of-life stuff. I was wary of having the crosshairs light up when an enemy (or barrel) would be hit, but given the sometimes unfair 2.5-D nature of the level design, and the spread of some of the bullet weapons, I'm keeping it on.</p>
<figure><figcaption><p>Cacodemons, chain guns, high-school-notebook Satanism—but in 4K, at 120Hz, and incredibly loud, if you like.</p><p>Bethesda Game Studios</p></figcaption></figure>
<p>If all that wasn't enough for you, there's 16-player co-op and deathmatch, with cross-platform play across Steam, Windows, Epic, and GOG on PC, and on Xbox, PlayStation, and Switch consoles, using room codes to connect everybody (and, it must be noted, a Bethesda account). There's even split-screen multiplayer, with up to eight people on a (very big) PC screen. Nightdive's port of the code to its KEX engine should make it easier for mods to be brought forward to this edition.</p>
<p>A caveat here that while the author is broadly aware of the many, many upgrades, mods, and other good things made possible by the open-source code and ports of&nbsp;<em>Doom</em> games (including <a href="https://zdoom.org/index">ZDoom</a>), he can't say exactly how they compare to this bundle. While Bethesda and Nightdive seem to have created a space for uploading mods and levels, and keeping the basic DOS version available, it remains to be seen how they work out over the long run. If open-source <em>Doom</em> was always good enough for you, or you don't like the idea of rebundling stuff that started out in the open, by all means, save yourself the $10 here. For many, though, this is just a far easier way to get at all the good stuff now possible in demon-shooting land.</p>
<p>If you haven't checked out&nbsp;<em>Doom</em> in a while, whether sitting in your library or just $10 away now, this is too easy an excuse to check in on it again. Do it soon. Hell devours the indolent, you know.</p>
<p><em>This post was updated at 8:40 a.m. to note the potential tension of Bethesda's rebundling of Doom against its open-source community.</em></p>

                <p>Video game actors in the SAG-AFTRA union are currently on strike over concerns about, among other things, artificial intelligence. Strauss Zelnick, the CEO of one of the game companies in the middle of the strike, Take-Two, said recently that he's "pretty confident" the two sides can make a deal.</p><p>"We deeply value our talent relationships, and historically we worked very successfully with all of the unions, including SAG-AFTRA," Zelnick said during <a href="https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2024/08/08/take-two-interactive-software-ttwo-q1-2025-earning/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Take-Two's latest earnings briefing</a>. "We continue to work hard to come to a resolution on this current situation. In fact, we have common ground on 24 out of 25 proposals. So, I'm pretty confident that we can get to a deal that will be mutually beneficial."</p>

<p>Zelnick went on to say that Take-Two does not expect any impact "whatsoever" for Take-Two's games that are currently in development. If the strike goes on for a long time, though, this would affect Take-Two and other companies, he said.</p><p>"We're cautiously optimistic that we'll be able to find common ground, and that's certainly our goal," Zelnick said. Asked if the strike could save Take-Two money due to work stoppages, Zelnick said, "We don't get any benefit from the situation."</p><p>The strike is limited to games that began production after September 2023--<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/grand-theft-auto-6-everything-we-know/1100-6503729/" data-ref-id="1100-6503729">so GTA VI is not affected</a>--while live-service games that have already been released are exempt from the strike as well.</p><p>It's not just Take-Two that's not worried about the video game strike right now. EA CEO Andrew Wilson recently said the company is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/eas-ceo-isnt-worried-about-immediate-impact-from-video-game-actors-strike/1100-6525423/" data-ref-id="1100-6525423">"working diligently to negotiate at the table" and hopeful for a resolution.</a></p><p>"We don't expect any near-term disruption to any of the games we have in development or any of the live services we're currently running."</p><p>Video game voice actors <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/video-game-actors-have-voted-to-authorize-a-strike-if-negotiations-fail/1100-6517987/" data-ref-id="1100-6517987">voted to authorize the strike</a> last September, but only just <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/video-game-voice-actors-are-going-on-strike-over-ai-enough-is-enough/1100-6525312/" data-ref-id="1100-6525312">initiated action as of July 26</a>, after SAG-AFTRA failed to come to an agreement with video game companies.

Some categories include "Horror" when lots of zombies are present in the shot, or "Brutality" when there's gore and carnage around. The "Erotica" category includes taking shots of upskirts or cleavage.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/max-payne-remakes-control-spinoff-remedy<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Max Payne&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Control&nbsp;</em>developer Remedy Entertainment has released its financial report for the first half of the 2025 fiscal year, and it contains some encouraging news about&nbsp;<em>Control 2&nbsp;</em>and the forthcoming&nbsp;<em>Max Payne&nbsp;</em>remakes.</p>
<p>Per Remedy's <a href="https://investors.remedygames.com/announcements/remedy-entertainment-plc-half-year-financial-report-january-june-2024-codename-condor-and-max-payne-12-remake-in-full-production-and-alan-wake-2-night-springs-expansion-launched/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">report</a>, the&nbsp;<em>Max Payne&nbsp;</em>remakes, which still don't have a release window, have now entered "the full production stage", having <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/max-payne-remakes-remedy-production">entered the "production readiness stage" back in October last year</a>. This suggests development on the remakes is progressing pretty smoothly.</p>
<p>The report also offers an update on&nbsp;<em>Control 2</em>, which was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/control-2-announcement-promises-more-mind-bending-fun">first announced in November 2022</a>. The upcoming sequel has entered the aforementioned "production readiness stage", according to Remedy, which means we can likely expect full production to ramp up a few months from now.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/remedy-revenue-max-payne-remakes-control-2.jpg?itok=FwHIS0o9 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/remedy-revenue-max-payne-remakes-control-2.jpg?itok=FPf1yaQg 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Control 2&nbsp;</em>is apparently ready to enter production.</figcaption></figure><p>Additionally, if you're looking for an update on Remedy's&nbsp;<em>Control&nbsp;</em>spinoff <i>Codename Condor</i>, which <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/remedy-trademark-fbc-firebreak">may or may not end up being called&nbsp;<em>FBC: Firebreak</em></a>, that's also in full production, according to Remedy.</p>
<p>All of this info comes from a financial report that also sees Remedy's revenue increasing by 33.7% year-over-year, although profits are down by around 10%, so it's not an entirely rosy picture for the Finnish studio.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, it looks like things still aren't looking up for horror sequel&nbsp;<em>Alan Wake 2</em>, either, as the game <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/alan-wake-2-budget-remedy-financials">has yet to turn a profit</a> ten months after its release. Despite that, Remedy CEO Tero Virtala says the game has "recouped most of its development and marketing expenses" at the time of the report's publication.</p>
<p>Virtala also says that the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/remedy-codename-kestrel-canceled">cancellation of Tencent collab&nbsp;</a><em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/remedy-codename-kestrel-canceled">Codename Kestrel</a>&nbsp;</em>back in May has given the studio "increased focus and better development synergies", as well as allowing it to "move experienced developers into other game projects".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/remedy-alan-wake-2.jpg?itok=RpW5fNxs 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/remedy-alan-wake-2.jpg?itok=gVRYcChq 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Alan Wake 2&nbsp;</em>still hasn't made Remedy any money, it seems.</figcaption></figure><p>So, what's next for Remedy? Right now, the studio has "two games in full production" (that's the&nbsp;<em>Max Payne&nbsp;</em>remakes and&nbsp;<em>Condor</em>, so it looks like Remedy is counting those remakes as one project) and one "in the production readiness stage" (i.e.&nbsp;<em>Control 2</em>).</p>
<p>The studio also says that since it <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/remedy-control-franchise-rights">acquired the rights to the&nbsp;<em>Control</em> franchise</a>&nbsp;from 505 Games, it's able to "choose how to bring [its] future games to the market", which involves "weighing self-publishing" and "different partner publishing opportunities".</p>
<p>We'll have to wait and see what happens next, but we'll likely get more info on the&nbsp;<em>Max Payne&nbsp;</em>remakes, as well as&nbsp;<em>Control 2&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Condor</em>, in the coming months. Stay tuned for more.</p>

Headsets, keyboards, mice, and other peripherals form the remainder of revenue, with all except mice being $1 billion-plus market categories. It is the Other category that will see the strongest rises to 2029, buoyed by sales of higher-value peripherals and accessories such as gamer chairs and steering wheels.</span></p><p>Source: Omdia’s Games Peripherals and Accessories Market Forecast 2024</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The latest data shows that global peripherals spend has kicked on from its new post-pandemic baseline, with 2023 revenue now surpassing the previous high from 2021.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">While games themselves face strong consumer resistance to price increases, there is more price elasticity for premium peripherals, with products such as PlayStation’s DualSense controller selling strongly despite costing $200+. With leading PC games storefront Steam stating that controller usage on its platform has tripled since 2018, there are positive factors beyond the ebb and flow of the console cycle contributing to what will be 2.9% annual growth from 2024 to 2029.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This year, for the first time Omdia has broken out gamepads revenue by brand, sizing Sony, Microsoft, Nintendo, and other brands’ gamepads. Nintendo’s growth comes from the runaway success of the Switch, but it has not tested the premium gamepad market in the same manner as its console rivals, with its top branded controllers coming in at well under $100.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Conversely, Microsoft’s current-generation Series X/S console has underperformed expectations, but the company’s position as the leading gamepad brand for PC has led to respectable growth nonetheless; Steam has stated that 59% of its greatly increased gamepad sessions were derived from Xbox controllers. Like Sony, Microsoft is also adept at providing offerings for the premium market, further boosting revenue.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Sony, however, enjoys both strong gamepads sales tied to console and an increased PC presence—Sony gamepads revenue is expected to break $2 billion by 2029—as well as providing desirable audio equipment such as the $200 Pulse earbuds.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Other gamepad brands straddle a wide range, from cheap, third-party versions of console controllers to top-of-the-range products from the likes of Turtle Beach, Razer, and SCUF.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">A sector to watch within this category is mobile controllers – gamepads from companies such as Backbone that attach to a smartphone, transforming it into a gaming device with a similar form factor to the Switch.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The potential to improve both mobile gaming itself, and the cloud gaming experience on mobile, is self-evident, and a factor behind Omdia’s belief that the Other category will surpass Microsoft gamepads revenue by 2029.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Game Developer and Omdia are sibling organizations under Informa</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Research Director, Game, Omdia </p><div data-testid="contributor-summary-content"><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Dom Tait is Omdia’s </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://omdia.tech.informa.com/authors/dom-tait">Research Director</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> for games, music and audio, and consumer platforms and AI research.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Dom joined Omdia in 2014 and has worked across the spectrum of entertainment and media on high-profile consulting projects, with a specialization in games and—increasingly—how they converge with other media.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Dom’s background is in media, having played editorial roles for a range of publications before joining Omdia.

Its launch back in February was marked by a meteoric ascent to the top of the charts, but the past few months have been marred by controversy and upheaval that has hurt the game and the reputation of the the team behind it.

It cast players as highly replaceable pawns in Super Earth’s army, which finds itself in the middle of a “second Galactic War” against other forces vying for control of the system. It’s an inherently ridiculous premise that walks and talks like a playable version of <em>Starship Troopers</em>.</p><p>At first, you could only face off against the Terminids, which are a bug-like alien species that descend on players in overwhelming numbers. Soon enough though, a second front of the war manifested against an army of robots that really plunged players into the deep end. To combat those odds, <em>Helldivers 2 </em>encouraged folks to invite their friends into the fray and rendered momentous experiences from the chaos that’d ensue.</p><p>That was the real thing that I feel sold <em>Helldivers 2</em> to so many people: it seemed to love mess. The game itself ultimately proved to be a little too glitchy for its own good, but at the outset, it kind of valued this sense of incongruity and wrongness, and even spun it into a fun aspect of the game. I don’t log in to <em>Helldivers 2</em>, drop into the action to “do my part,” and feel terribly triumphant. I certainly exclaim after we successfully extract from a mission, but I walk away from these skirmishes thinking, “What the hell are we doing here? We’re getting lit up by killer robots who are thinning our literal manpower and then getting vivisected by bugs. We’re barely making it, what the fuck.” And that was an exhilarating feeling that nothing else was providing.</p><p>I spend most of my time in the game running away from all the things trying to kill me. In the meantime, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-kill-beat-impalers-guide-update-1851614495&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-kill-beat-impalers-guide-update-1851614495">Impalers’ tentacles are bursting out of the ground </a></span>and sending me flying. Robots are tearing me to bits. My own flying laser sentry <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-friendly-fire-always-on-arrowhead-ps5-pc-1851329269&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-friendly-fire-always-on-arrowhead-ps5-pc-1851329269">can’t distinguish between friend and foe</a></span>, often setting me on fire or slicing through an ally in an instant. My own friends will call down heavy artillery from our battleships in orbit that wind up incinerating fellow team members in order to eradicate bug nests. And when you finally extract from a nightmare of a mission, you emerge back onto the ship a bloody mess.</p><p>Things continued to look up for <em>Helldivers 2 </em>for a few months. New features like <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-mechs-tien-kwan-1851317710&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-mechs-tien-kwan-1851317710">pilotable mech suits</a></span> were woven into larger storylines playing out over the weeks. Major orders taught the community to work together toward common goals. Strategies formed, teams were decided on, and battles were fought. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-malevelon-creek-memorial-capes-1851384481&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-malevelon-creek-memorial-capes-1851384481">Malevelon Creek</a></span>, a famously embattled planet in <em>Helldivers 2</em>’s first months, became an almost religious site, and is now commemorated with an in-game holiday. For months, writing about <em>Helldivers 2</em> felt like writing about an entirely different beast every few weeks.</p><p>For a while there, <em>Helldivers 2 </em>was almost perceived as punk by the players who loved it. Here was this game that bucked every big trend, from pricing to release cadence. This game that was heavy metal and messy and audacious. It was an overnight sensation in an industry that often glorifies highly polished and sanitized experiences over something as rough and tumble as <em>Helldivers 2</em>. It was an outlier blazing some new path forward.</p><p><strong>Read More: </strong><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-flamethrower-nerf-charger-patch-1851614478&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-flamethrower-nerf-charger-patch-1851614478">Flamethrowers Were King In <em>Helldivers 2</em>, But Not Anymore And Players Are Threatening Mass Desertions</a></span></p><p>Before long though, things shifted for the worse. Suddenly, the sweeping changes that Arrowhead Studios was making all the time stopped being novel, and became more of a hindrance. Arrowhead stopped being the architects of players’ dreams and fantasies; instead they became this kind of collar around the community’s neck. Balance changes continued to drastically change the game every other week, upsetting both veteran and casual players alike. Sure, <em>Helldivers 2 </em>prided itself on being a bit of a mess, but what it really needed was some foundation that wouldn’t be eroded by an update five days later. </p><p>Everything that people championed about the game at the beginning came right back around to bite it in the ass, but how could we expect anything else? <em>This </em>is what these games do and are about. These are the incredibly fickle “models” of games that we’re inheriting and continuously propping up. By throwing your weight behind them, you tacitly approve of these kinds of shifts. For better and certainly for worse, you commit to the ups and downs of this journey.</p><p>Unfortunately the community hasn’t always seen it that way. While <em>Helldivers 2 </em>has its loving and loyal fans, video games tend to have audiences capable of immense vitriol, and <em>Helldivers 2 </em>and its developers have certainly experienced their fair share of that venom in a short time. Look no further than the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-psn-steam-account-linking-explained-sony-1851455071&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-psn-steam-account-linking-explained-sony-1851455071">PSN login drama</a></span> that nearly ended the game, and from which Arrowhead is <em>still </em>reeling. An unforced error in judgment from the game’s publisher caused an unpopular mandate to go out which quite literally ripped the game’s burgeoning global community apart. I’m almost sure that there are <em>still </em>countries and regions in the world where <em>Helldivers 2 </em>hasn’t returned to PC storefronts because they couldn’t support PSN and were forced to pull the game.</p><p>Anyone with some sense might’ve told Sony that requiring a PSN account to play a game you bought on a different platform was boneheaded, but the move really put Arrowhead on its backfoot since it had to bear the brunt of the backlash. Due to an incredibly reckless ploy, a studio and game that requires an engaged and recurring community to stay afloat suddenly found itself on the outs through no fault of its own. The worst part is that even though Sony eventually walked back the mandate, the target on Arrowhead’s back has never really gone away, and as I wrote a few months back, it started to seem like the game <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-dark-fluid-mission-fix-arrowhead-1851512049&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-dark-fluid-mission-fix-arrowhead-1851512049">just couldn’t catch a break</a></span>.</p><p>Now, every update is met with some level of trepidation. If Arrowhead does something the community deems even remotely out of line, its fans pounce on it with an intensity I’ve rarely seen so up close. Sometimes, that means that the studio is <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-patch-buff-stratagems-1851540317&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-patch-buff-stratagems-1851540317">heralded when popular changes are implemented</a></span>, like a balance patch that strengthened some abilities in the game over a month ago. However for every one of those patches, there are ones like the most recent update, which has once again sparked a fire under the community and is <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-flamethrower-nerf-charger-patch-1851614478&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-flamethrower-nerf-charger-patch-1851614478">motivating many to up and abandon the game</a></span>. I fear that <em>Helldivers 2 </em>and Arrowhead are now in a vicious cycle of their own making.</p><p>It’s a shame because <em>Helldivers 2 </em>is still as great as it ever was. I’ve recently picked it up again after a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;http://v&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="http://v/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">major update released earlier this week</a></span>, and when you’re <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-farming-grinding-max-level-samples-ps5-pc-1851287157&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-farming-grinding-max-level-samples-ps5-pc-1851287157">not preoccupied with being the very best player</a></span> ever, it’s still a blast unlike most anything else on the market. I just hope others wise up to that before the various forces pushing and pulling on the game and its developers undo everything that they worked so hard to create.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/unity-6-is-on-track-for-a-fall-2024-release/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>According to a new <a href="https://s26.q4cdn.com/977690160/files/doc_financials/2024/q2/Unity-Q224-Transcript.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">earnings call</a> released this week, Unity CEO Matt Bromberg states that the upcoming Unity 6 game engine upgrade is expected to release in Fall 2024.</p>



<p>Bromberg says that Unity 6 is “on track for release this fall,” and adds that Unity believes “it will be the most stable, best-performing version we’ve ever delivered.” </p>



<p>Additionally, Bromberg reinforces that “Unity 6 is going to be the bedrock of our offering for years to come.” </p>



<figure></figure>







<p>One analyst specifically asked about Unity’s upcoming runtime fees, the Pro transition, and any potential tier pricing changes. </p>



<p>Regarding price increases, Bromberg said that “we don’t expect to see them right away, but we do see them coming in over time.” </p>



<p>The divisive Runtime Fees apply to games created with or upgraded to Unity 6. The thresholds also include $1 million USD revenue trailing 12 months, and 1 million initial engagements. </p>



<p>In a separate <a href="https://s26.q4cdn.com/977690160/files/doc_financials/2024/q2/Q224-Shareholder-letter.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shareholder letter</a> today, Unity also reported that “second quarter results exceeded guidance for both revenue and Adjusted EBITDA.” </p>



<p>However, the letter also mentions that revenue from Unity’s strategic portfolio was “down 6% year-over-year.”</p>



<p>Unity recently faced fan backlash, and in May 2024, reports surfaced that new Unity CEO Matthew Bromberg <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/unity-ceo-salary-new-bonus/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">netted millions</a> to sign on for the role via base salary and a bonus. The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/unity-ceo-stepping-down/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">previous CEO stepped down</a> in October 2023.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/doom-eternal-modding-tool-preview<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>id Software and Bethesda have released a new&nbsp;<em>Doom Eternal&nbsp;</em>update that includes a preview of the game's new modding tool, which you can use to download, organize, and play your favorite mods.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/782330/view/4328607063611272123" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a post</a> on the&nbsp;<em>Doom Eternal&nbsp;</em>Steam page, the two studios say that they're "so impressed" with&nbsp;<em>Doom Eternal</em>'s modding community and its ability to create mods without any tools.</p>
<p>These community efforts were the inspiration behind the release of idStudio, which allows you to create and play&nbsp;<em>Doom Eternal&nbsp;</em>mods, and they were also the inspiration behind the PC Mod Preview, which lets you check out the mods others have made.</p>
<p>This feature is only available on the PC versions of&nbsp;<em>Doom Eternal</em>, so you'll only be able to check it out if you're playing on Steam or the Microsoft Store. It's supported on both storefronts, though, so if you're playing on Game Pass, you can still check it out.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/doom-eternal-modding-tool-pain-elemental.jpg?itok=4v3uAcAK 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/doom-eternal-modding-tool-pain-elemental.jpg?itok=E_ZwDpPP 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Doom Eternal&nbsp;</em>has some new modding tools for you to enjoy.</figcaption></figure><p>Sadly, the idStudio beta is only available via Steam, so if you're interested in building your own&nbsp;<em>Doom Eternal&nbsp;</em>mods, you'll have to be playing on the Steam version to do so. However, the mods you build can still be enjoyed by Microsoft Store players.</p>
<p>If you want to opt into the PC Mod Preview build on Steam, all you've got to do is head into&nbsp;<em>Doom Eternal</em>'s Properties, then select the PC Mod Preview beta from the Betas drop-down menu. You can read more about&nbsp;<em>Doom Eternal</em>'s shiny new modding feature <a href="https://idstudio.idsoftware.com/faq" rel="noopener" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>
<h2><em>Doom&nbsp;</em>fans have more to look forward to as well</h2>
<p>It's not just&nbsp;<em>Doom Eternal&nbsp;</em>modding tools that&nbsp;<em>Doom&nbsp;</em>fans have to enjoy right now, as Nightdive Studios has also stepped forward with a brand new surprise release.</p>
<p>The studio, which is behind the re-release of retro classics like&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/90s-classic-shadow-man-remastered-coming-to-pc-in-april">Shadow Man</a>&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nightdive-the-thing-remaster-tease"><em>The Thing</em></a>, dropped remasters of the first two&nbsp;<em>Doom&nbsp;</em>games yesterday as part of Bethesda's QuakeCon celebrations.</p>

<p>Available across PC and consoles, the two remasters pack in a huge amount of content, including&nbsp;<em>Doom&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Doom 2</em>, all of their expansions, and even a brand new episode created as a collab between id, Nightdive, and MachineGames.</p>
<p>In short, if you're a&nbsp;<em>Doom&nbsp;</em>fan, you're eating well right now, especially given that a brand new <em>Doom&nbsp;</em>game is <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/every-xbox-showcase-2024-announcement">also on the horizon</a>. Stay tuned for more on this and all other things&nbsp;<em>Doom</em>.</p>

<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/disney-dreamlight-valley">Disney Dreamlight Valley</a> will round out its current roadmap with the addition of Princess and the Frog's Tiana later this month, a new Steam post from developer Gameloft has confirmed. 
</p>
<p>
Owners of the life sim live service's paid expansion Rift in Time will also get the concluding chapter of its story, in which you can see off the evil Jafar for good.
</p>
<p>
Looking towards the tail end of this year, Disney Dreamlight Valley creative director Joshua Labelle <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1401590/view/4325229363897533816?l=english">acknowledged</a> that updates would become lighter than usual as the team ramped up to announce its next all-new roadmap and a larger update before the end of this year. 
</p>
<p>
Still, October will see players return to the game's Lion King realm to this time welcome Timon and Pumbaa. PlayStation owners of the game will also finally get the option to play via cross-platform multiplayer, with cross-save coming later in the year.
</p>
<p>
"Our October update will be smaller in scope and shorter," Labelle wrote, "with a focus on fixes and quality of life improvements to make your game experience smoother and more enjoyable as we ramp up to a bigger update later in the year."
</p>
<p>
In "late 2024", Gameloft has teased that players will be able to "stitch a new mystery together", accompanied by the patchwork dress worn by Sally in The Nightmare Before Christmas. Expect a 2025 roadmap for Disney Dreamlight Valley around the same time. 
</p>

<p>
Labelle also wrote in broad terms about the future of Disney Dreamlight Valley, now nearly two years on from its original launch. In short, following fan feedback, improvements will be made to the game's furniture and wardrobe menus, as well as to provide more room for decoration in players' increasingly crowded Valleys.
</p>
<p>
"Last year, we promised to keep delivering free content updates that add new characters, Realms, clothing, furniture, and more surprises. That promise is as important today as it was then, especially when we look at new Villagers," Labelle concluded.
</p>
<p>
"Recent surveys have played an important role by providing us insight into what you'd like to see in Disney Dreamlight Valley and 2025 is already shaping up to be a year full of exciting surprises."

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/activision-starts-to-issue-cease-desists-to-black-ops-6-leakers-and-host-sites.949029/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-6-c-and-d/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>Following a large number of Call of Duty Black Ops 6 leaks, Activision has started to issue Cease and Desist letters to Black Ops 6 leakers and host sites.</p>



<p>One of the biggest Black Ops 6 hosts was ‘PSLAN,’ who claimed that they had received a Cease and Desist letter from Activision. According to PSLAN, Activision claimed in the letter that the user was selling Black Ops 6 access for 6 euros a month and is claiming 250,000 euros in damages. As Insider Gaming reported a couple of days ago, hundreds of people <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-6-hundreds-of-people-playing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">were already playing Black Ops 6</a> via PSLAN.</p>



<p>PSLAN has since removed support for Black Ops 6.</p>



<p>In addition to the host being issued <span>a C&amp;D, it appears that some Call of Duty leakers have also been issued similar </span>notices. Twitter user&nbsp;<a href="https://x.com/HeyImAlaix" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">@HeyImAlaix</a>, who has been leaking Call of Duty for several years, has also seemingly been issued&nbsp;a C&amp;D (and not for the first time).</p>



<p>It’s unlikely that the Cease and Desists will stop the leakers from leaking Call of Duty, but for now, the flow of Black Ops 6 leaks will likely slow down. In addition to the C&amp;D, Activision has also been issuing DMCA takedowns on all Black Ops 6 content.</p>



<p>Black Ops 6 multiplayer is set to be officially&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/where-to-watch-codnext/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed at the end of August in a CODNext event</a>, which will be prior to the Black Ops 6 BETA.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">Brendan Depa, 18, was sentenced to five years in state prison on Tuesday for "brutally" beating a high school teaching assistant over a Nintendo Switch. The incident, which occurred on February 21, 2023, at Matanzas High School in Palm Coast, Florida, was captured on video and widely reported. Depa will also serve 15 years of probation following his release, as reported by <a href="https://www.news-journalonline.com/story/news/courts/2024/08/06/live-brendan-depa-florida-teen-who-beat-teachers-aide-to-be-sentenced/74671170007/" rel="nofollow ">Daytona Beach News-Journal</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">Depa, then 17, attacked Joan Naydich after an altercation involving the gaming console. The video shows Depa assaulting Naydich in a school hallway, pushing her to the ground, and repeatedly kicking and punching her.</p><p dir="ltr">"Compounding the senseless physical violence was the screaming of obscenities, spitting on Ms. Naydich both before and during the incident," Circuit Judge Terence Perkins said, also highlighting Depa's lack of remorse. "He pursued her down the hallway, pushed her so violently from behind that she flew through the air and was knocked unconscious when she landed on the hallway floor. He then proceeded to kick her, then jump on top of her, striking her in the head and body more than 15 times."</p><p dir="ltr">Depa's defense argued that his autism spectrum disorder and his mother's criticisms of the sentence should be considered. Leanne Depa claimed that the sentence was influenced by racial and disability biases and criticized the school for not managing her son's disabilities properly.</p><p dir="ltr">Assistant State Attorney Melissa Clark argued for a substantial punishment, stating, "He almost killed a woman. He should be punished for that." Naydich, who suffers from PTSD and other long-term impacts, noted the significant personal and professional consequences of the attack.</p><p dir="ltr">Depa has the right to appeal the sentence but is ordered to have no contact with Naydich and to remain 500 feet away from her home and workplace.</p>

<p>Zelnick added: "I think that offering a frontline title with a premium price in a subscription service, day-and-date, will push consumers to that subscription service for at least a period of time."</p><p>Zelnick has been saying a version of this for years. In 2021, the executive said Take-Two <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/take-two-ceo-doesnt-want-new-games-on-game-pass/1100-6494686/" data-ref-id="1100-6494686">doesn't put its major new games on subscription services at launch</a> because "the economics are much more difficult to make sense of." In 2022, Zelnick said doing this <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/take-two-ceo-says-launching-new-games-into-a-subscription-service-like-game-pass-makes-no-sense/1100-6509015/" data-ref-id="1100-6509015">makes no economic sense.</a></p><p>Zelnick maintains that there are major differences between the linear entertainment (TV/film) business and interactive entertainment (video game) business, and while a subscription service may make sense for linear entertainment, Zelnick doesn't see the same viability for games.</p><p>"The interactive entertainment business is very different than the linear entertainment business. People consume far fewer hours of interactive entertainment in a given month than they do of linear entertainment," he said. "And within that consumption, there are far fewer titles consumed in interactive entertainment than there are with linear entertainment. So I, at least, pose the question as to whether subscription makes as much sense for interactive entertainment as it does for linear entertainment and registered some skepticism, which I still hold."</p><p>Launching a major new game into a subscription services is "just a lost opportunity for the publisher," Zelnick said.</p><p>Take-Two has over the years experimented with bringing its biggest games, including GTA V and Red Dead Redemption 2, to services like Game Pass and PS Plus. Theses games have rotated in and out of the catalogs. Zelnick has said bringing its older titles to a subscription service might make sense, but for new titles, it's not something Take-Two is looking to do.</p><p>While Microsoft launches all of its first-party games into Xbox Game Pass on day one, Sony doesn't do this with its own PlayStation Plus membership program. PlayStation's former president Jim Ryan seemed to agree with Zelnick and previously discussed how <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-boss-on-why-it-wont-launch-games-day-one-on-ps-plus-like-xbox-game-pass/1100-6501975/" data-ref-id="1100-6501975">this doesn't make economic sense.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/thank-goodness-youre-here-impressions-north<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Britain: it's a complicated place. Take the name, for example: am I talking about the nation, whose full name is The United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland? Am I talking about the <em>land</em>, which could be the island of Great Britain (the big one with England, Scotland and Wales in it), or the British Isles as a whole, which is a bunch of island that would also include both Irelands and the Channel Islands?</p><p>Confusing, right? No wonder so many Americans always get it wrong when talking about the place. It's also no wonder, then, that a lot of people not from the British Isles have no interest or capacity to learn about the differences between the peoples and regions of the place. It's probably hard enough for an American or European to remember which one Wales is, let alone the West Country, Ulster and the Midlands.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Thank Goodness You’re Here! - Reveal Trailer - Nintendo Switch" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/siT1HTSCY4g?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Those differences can be very important to the people who live there, though. And while some centuries-old relationships and rivalries are pretty well-known internationally--you don't need me explaining <em>Braveheart</em> to you--others might be less obvious to outsiders. Few more so than the north.</p><p>England might look like one country on the map, but for around 1000 years now--as long as it's been England, basically--it's been a country divided. There's the north, and everyone south of the north. I won't bore you with the full history here, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/North%E2%80%93South_divide_in_England" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">you can study that in your own time if you're interested</a>, just know that from the Viking age through to the legacies of Thatcher and Brexit, England has not been as united as it might appear from the outside.</p><p>Countries always have their differences, but what I've always found interesting about England’s divide is the way that so much of what has been defined as English culture, so much of what has represented the country in its most popular media around the world, revolves around the South, especially London. I'm going to <em>wildly </em>generalise here, but from Dickens to <em>Notting Hill</em>, the streets and accents of England as depicted on the screen tend to be those from the South. </p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Every “Northern” character in a musical" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/n8uQ7VCWOnY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>When the north must be portrayed, it's usually as a downtrodden caricature (see: <em>The Full Monty</em> or <em>Billy Elliot</em>), or in service of a fantasy universe's hardiest and most workmanlike peoples (see: the Starks). Imagine my surprise, then, when I first discovered then spent all weekend playing <em>Thank Goodness You're Here</em>, <a href="https://aftermath.site/thank-goodness-youre-here-review" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a game Riley already covered</a> because it's "hilarious and helpful", but which I also found of huge interest because it's a game that isn't just set in the north (and developed by a small studio based in Yorkshire), it's a <em>celebration </em>of it.</p><p><em>Thank Goodness You're Here</em> takes the piss out of itself at every given opportunity, but at the same time there's so much love for the culture and setting that I think it's the most defining thing about the game, even more than its brilliant writing and cast of unforgettable weirdos.</p><p>The fictional town of Barnsworth feels like a <em>place </em>in the best way, in the way all great video game places do, by being simultaneously small yet huge, intimate but expansive, a place where you know everybody and every street corner but are still always finding new things. And it's a place that's unashamedly of the north. If you've played the game and wondered why there are dialect options even though the game is set in England, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/English_language_in_Northern_England#:~:text=There%20are%20traditional%20dialects%20associated,the%20nineteenth%20and%20twentieth%20centuries." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">that's why</a>. Why the intro shows a region stuck in the 1950s <a href="https://jacobin.com/2023/03/the-north-will-rise-again-alex-niven-book-review-thatcherism-england-industry" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">even though it's the modern era</a>; <a href="https://www.yorkshirehandmadepies.co.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">why</a> it's so proud of its pies.</p><figure></figure><p>It's great! My own English family is from Birmingham and I used to live just outside Brighton–which is as south as it gets–so I feel like a bit of an outsider writing this, but my wife's family is from Hull, and they roared with laughter at just about every part of the game I showed them last week, from the voice acting to the architecture to<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=siT1HTSCY4g" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> the Peans commercial</a>. The idea that a <em>video game</em> would pitch itself like this was as welcome as it was surprising to them. And seeing their reaction as locals (or at least in their case former locals) made me wish more "Western" games could be this distinctly regional (with a shoutout here to another recent example of this,<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88c-k4jQB-c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> <em>A Highland Song</em></a>).</p><p>I actually meant to publish this piece earlier in the week, <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/ckg55we5n3xo" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">but then events transpired</a> and a blog about a quaint northern town suddenly seemed a bit ill-timed; this was not a great moment to be exploring a game that was so enthusiastically proud of everything great about the place while the world was seeing the absolute worst of it. At my lowest point I was wondering which of <em>Thank Goodness You're Here's</em> otherwise cheerful residents could I picture <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c9d1yq4552no" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">firebombing a library in a fit of anti-immigration rage</a>.</p><p>Thankfully common sense and human decency have prevailed; as destructive as a minority of hateful bigots have been, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/aug/07/anti-racism-protesters-fill-streets-of-english-cities-as-far-right-threat-recedes" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">good and normal people have banded together across England--but especially in the north, where the initial attacks made the headlines</a>--and with a series of counter-protests shown the country and the world that fascists belong in only one place: the bin.</p><p>So I got to publish this little blog about how much I love a lovely little town after all. And only had to add one caveat: if anyone in Barnsworth was going to be a fascist, it would probably be this guy:</p><figure></figure></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Redemption Road's time-travelling bring-an-assault-rifle-to-a-medieval-sword-fight shooter and strategy game, Kingmakers, isn't even out yet, but it's already secured a movie adaptation.</p>
<p>In an <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2109770/view/4339866697716610827?l=english">update</a> on Steam, the studio said it was "absolutely thrilled" that the unreleased game was "making its way to the big screen" in partnership with publisher tinyBuild and Story Kitchen.</p>

<p>Story Kitchen - which specialises in "the adaptation of video games and other 'non-traditional' IP into film and TV" shows - was founded in 2022 by Sonic the Hedgehog producer, Dmitri M. Johnson.

<p>As for the game itself? Redemption has yet to provide a definitive release date, but it's still slated to release later this year.</p>
<p>"Over the last decade or so, alongside the bigger, fewer bets publishers have made - which has also often led to formula, to conservatism - an onward march in graphical fidelity means that a certain kind of game has become obsessed with the details. I love details, and I love that games do this," Donlan wrote when <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/kingmakers-is-the-glorious-embodiment-of-one-of-gamings-most-powerful-rules-and-i-am-here-for-it">Kingsmakers memorable teaser dropped</a>.</p>
<p>"But as a trend, it can sometimes lead people to think that blockbusters are things that are made to be admired more than anything else. And it's nice to have someone drive a Mazda Barracuda, or whatever it is, right through that idea now and again. Don't admire this game. Thrill to it. Lose yourself in it. Break it and laugh wildly as it responds to what you've just done."</p>

            <p>
Dragon Age developer BioWare has discussed its decision to no longer allow full control over companions during combat, in a shake-up to the series set to be seen in upcoming entry The Veilguard. 
</p>
<p>
The change has been made for several reasons, game director Corinne Busche told Edge magazine (thanks, <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/dragon-age/dragon-age-the-veilguard-wont-let-you-control-your-companions-because-you-cant-handle-it-this-is-a-much-higher-actions-per-minute-game">GamesRadar</a>), most notably the additional options instead available to controlling main character Rook. 
</p>
<p>
The Veilguard "is a much higher actions-per-minute game," Busche explained. "It is more technically demanding on the player. So when we tried allowing you full control of your companions as well, what we've found is it wasn't actually adding to the experience. In fact, in some ways it was detrimental, given the demanding nature of just controlling your own character."
</p>
<p>
Another reason was that BioWare wanted to give companion characters a sense of autonomy - to feel like "fully-realised" personalities "in control of their own actions", Busche added. 
</p>
<p>
Players will still be able to trigger abilities via the activity wheel in battle, as part of The Veilguard's focus on combo-based combat. (This is something BioWare's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mass-effect-3">Mass Effect 3</a> introduced to fun results, where you could set off chain biotic explosions with the correct combo of abilities.)
</p>
<p>
"I will admit that, on paper, if you just read that you have no ability to control your companions, that might feel like something was taken away," Busche concludes. "But in our testing and validating with players, what we find is they're more engaged than ever."
</p>
<p>Other changes added by BioWare include a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragon-age-the-veilguard-difficulty-options-let-you-turn-off-death-and-manually-adjust-enemy-health">suite of difficulty options to let you turn off death completely</a>, if you so choose, and adjust enemy health.</p>
<p>
"Whisper it, but <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/whisper-it-but-dragon-age-the-veilguard-has-me-thinking-the-unthinkable-it-looks-like-bioware-is-back">Dragon Age: The Veilguard has me thinking the unthinkable</a>: it looks like BioWare is back," our Chris Tapsell wrote after going hands-on with the game. There's still no firm release date yet, but it's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragon-age-the-veilguard-release-date-narrowed">set to arrive between 1st October and 31st December</a>.

Arkane founder Raphael Colantonio has said he was saddened by the closure--but he doesn't think the studio's unique brand of immersive sim is going anywhere.</p><p>"It's sad, of course," Colantonio said in an interview with <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/arkane-founder-was-saddened-by-the-closure-of-arkane-austin-but-says-immersive-sims-arent-going-anywhere-the-studio-is-gone-but-the-people-survive/?utm_source=twitter.com&amp;utm_campaign=socialflow&amp;utm_medium=social" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PC Gamer</a>. "I wanted to see our game going forever, for obvious reasons. But the company is [gone], but not the people. The people survive."</p><p>The Arkane founder discussed the history of the company and the genre itself, pointing to Looking Glass Studios, which he described as "the originator of the immersive sim." Despite shuttering in 2000, Looking Glass released a number of influential games including System Shock and Thief, and eventually inspired the founding of Arkane, which also employed a number of ex-Looking Glass developers.</p><p>Colantonio also pointed to Black Isle Studios, which closed in 2003, but carried on its legacy through its people. "You had Brian Fargo make his own company, you had Troika, you had Obsidian," Colantonio said. "We still remember Black Isle as a great company in that genre, but then we still have their games."</p><p>Arkane isn't fully gone, of course, with the Lyon studio still in operation, but Colantonio himself has since moved on with his new project Wolfeye Studios, which released its first game Weird West in 2022.</p><p>"We're doing more with Wolfeye," Colantonio added. "The spirit of the immersive sim, I think sometimes that's what you need--sometimes you need a renewal, you need a new impulse. And I think that's going to spawn more little immersive sim companies. So while [the Arkane Austin closure] is a sad event, I don't think it necessarily means that immersive sims are going to go away."</p><p>Colantonio very recently teased more about <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/arkane-founder-says-his-studios-next-game-will-make-dishonored-and-prey-fans-happy/1100-6525576/" data-ref-id="1100-6525576">Wolfeye's next game</a>, a retro-sci-fi RPG he says will make fans of Dishonored and Prey very happy.</p>

          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p>The government of Turkey has issued a nationwide block on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/roblox-game-client/" data-ref-id="5000-451936">Roblox</a>, a gaming platform popular with children that hosts mostly user-generated content. The ban was instigated due to concerns around alleged child exploitation and inappropriate content.</p><p>While no explanation was initially given for the ban, an official from the Turkish Directorate of Communications quoted by <a href="https://www.turkiyetoday.com/turkiye/roblox-banned-in-turkiye-following-nationwide-instagram-block-37398/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Turkiye Today</a> (via <a href="https://www.dexerto.com/roblox/roblox-gets-banned-indefinitely-in-turkey-over-child-exploitation-2855423/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Dexerto</a>) said that the move was motivated by reported inappropriate sexual content on the platform. The official alleged that the platform was a gathering place for pedophiles, and that its in-game currency Robux was being used to incentivize childrens' participation in inappropriate activities, a claim backed up by a <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2024-roblox-pedophile-problem/?srnd=undefined" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">recent Businessweek report</a> on how predators have used Roblox to groom children.</p><p>The official also raised the issue of gambling on the platform, alleging predatory tactics targeting children. In addition to all of these issues, the official also said there was an overall issue with regulation of inappropriate content on the platform, with Roblox's existing oversight measures not enough to address said issues.</p><p>The Roblox ban comes just days after Turkey blocked Instagram for all users in the country, while other Meta-owned apps and platforms remain accessible. The Instagram and Roblox bans don't appear to be related at this time.</p><p>Roblox has put out a statement on the ban, saying it is "currently working with local authorities with the goal of resolving it," noting that it has millions of users in Turkey, including some developers who may rely on the platform for their entire income. "We're committed to doing everything we can to keep our community safe, and we share global policymakers' commitment to protecting children," Roblox said.</p><p>As a platform built on user-generated content, Roblox has faced accusations of a different kind of child exploitation in the past, with concerns the company is profiting off child labor. Roblox's studio head <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/roblox-boss-talks-teens-making-money-on-the-game-disputes-exploitation-claims/1100-6522420/" data-ref-id="1100-6522420">disputed this claim</a>, saying that a majority of its creators are over 20 years old, and that young developers were benefitting from learning valuable skills.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/splitgate-2-will-add-bum-slides-and-time-altering-bubbles-to-its-portal-hopping-shootsing<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>The first <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/splitgate">Splitgate</a> was a cracker mash-up of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/halo-infinite">Halo</a> multiplayer gunfights and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/portal">Portal</a>'s nifty spacetime windows. It was a gimmick that made flanking fun again, at least until you died to a distant rifle that was right next to you all along. Its sequel, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/splitgate-2">Splitgate 2</a> is continuing that gimmick but is also sprucing up the free-to-play arena shooter with a few modern additions, like bum-sliding around corners and big deployable bubbles called "time domes" that slow down your enemies yet speed up your allies. All this and more comes from a gameplay trailer that went up yesterday.</p>

<p>There you have it. Basically, the 4v4 arena <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">shooter</a> is adding character abilities, which you can mix and match according to faction. One faction, Aeros, is all about moving fast with a speedy sprinting ability and a faster reload time, popping stims to keep themselves alive. The bulky Sabrask faction get sticky grenades and a pop-up "smart shield" that blocks enemy bullets but allows their own to pass through. And the healing-focused Meridian can briefly spot folks through walls. There's also a "health grenade" suggesting you'll be able to blast buds with feel-good sparkles from afar. Plus that "time dome", which speeds up friendly player movement (and shooting) while they stand inside. Enemies who enter will feel the opposite effect, slowing down noticeably, which I imagine makes it a decent area denial tactic as well as a support option. Cool.</p>
<p>As you can probably tell from the trailer, it seems to be taking an esportsy angle. I'm more of a casual bullet basker, so seeing a cadre of Twitch streamers doing call-outs does nothing for me in terms of excitement. And if this is the approach, I can't help but fear some of the scrappy fun of the first game will be sanded away in favour of clinical and competitive match-ups. I know it's early days for this sequel (we've only seen <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/portal-hopping-shooter-splitgate-2-revealed-looks-like-the-original-cult-fps-but-with-a-lot-more-money">one other cinematic trailer</a>) but there are no signs of daft stuff like the rocket launchers and baseball bats that made the first game <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/splitgate-review">such a riot</a> at times. They're only showing off a vanilla 4v4 mode for now. I take some comfort from <a href="https://www.splitgate.com/faq">a developer FAQ</a>  in which they say they are "focused on creating different and distinct experiences". But what those experiences will be? I shrug at you.</p>
<p>There are some other interesting moments in the trailer, mind. A weapon called the Splitstream looks like an SMG that can split into two guns to be dual wielded, similar to the Strelak Verso dual pistols in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/deathloop">Deathloop</a>. At one point a player jets up between balconies full of spectators, where they are suddenly surrounded by puffs of confetti as they gun someone down from on-high. Hooray! If you're desperate to see more, the devs will be streaming a 2-hour demonstration on August 14 on <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?u=https%3A%2F%2Ftwitch.tv%2Fsplitgate">their Twitch channel</a>.</p>
<p>It's due out sometime in 2025. Meanwhile, Splitgate The First faces an uncertain future as a result of developers 1047 Games focusing on the sequel. And although they say the studio has "no plans" to shut down the first game's servers before the end of this year, they are still leaving that possibility open for the following year. </p>
<p>"We know that it is common to kill the servers of the previous version of a game when a new one comes out. We know why companies do this," say the shooter devs. "What we do with Splitgate next year is, to be completely honest, unknown to us right now."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Over two years since the official announcement, the Max Payne 1 and 2 remake has finally entered full production, Remedy Entertainment confirmed today.</p>
<p>In its l<a href="https://investors.remedygames.com/announcements/remedy-entertainment-plc-half-year-financial-report-january-june-2024-codename-condor-and-max-payne-12-remake-in-full-production-and-alan-wake-2-night-springs-expansion-launched/">atest financial report</a>, the development studio provided an update on the projects currently in development, starting from the highly anticipated remake that will combine the first two entries in the series. According to today's update, the remake entered full production in the second quarter of 2024, and the current goal is to have the game in an early functional state from beginning to end.</p>
<p>Besides providing an update on the Max Payne 1 and 2 remake, Remedy Entertainment also revealed more on the state of Control 2 and the project codenamed Condor, a multiplayer game set in the world of Control. The second entry in the series entered the production readiness phase in the second quarter of the year, the final one before entering full production. A build showcasing important features in playable form has also been created. Regarding publishing the game, Remedy is talking to potential partners but still has to decide whether to self-publish the game and Condor or find a publisher. Project Condor also entered full production in March 2024, and the team is currently focusing on creating maps and mission types while continuing playtesting internally and externally, the latter in a limited capacity.</p>
<p>The Max Payne 1 and 2 remake developer also provided a small update on <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/alan-wake-ii-it-truly-was-an-ocean/">Alan Wake 2</a>, its latest title. The game has yet to recoup its costs, and The Lake House is currently in the works for a yet-to-be-confirmed release date.</p>
<p>Not much is currently known about the Max Payne 1 and 2 remake as of now. Back when the remake was announced, Remedy confirmed it will be powered by the studio's Northlight Engine and will be in line with a typical Remedy AAA-game production. A release window has yet to be confirmed.</p>
