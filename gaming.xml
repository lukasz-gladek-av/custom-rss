Now, after the dust has settled and people have had time to play it, the general sentiment is that it’s pretty good. I’ve enjoyed it a lot. And I also appreciate that it also doesn’t take up 200GB of space on my console’s SSD. But this is 2024 and people can’t just live in the moment and enjoy something. No, we must think about the future. What’s next for <em>XDefiant</em>? Ubisoft gave us a vague road map, but a dataminer has provided more information. In fact, they’ve shared too much, it seems, as Ubisoft has reportedly used DMCA takedowns to remove some of their online leaks. </p><h2 id="h10639"><a id=""></a>New factions, weapons, and modes coming to <em>XDefiant</em></h2><p>Over on Twitter, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/AgainTx&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/AgainTx" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">user Rogue TX</a></span> has been sharing what seems to be datamined content and files from <em>XDefiant. </em>This leaked content appears to provide us with <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/AgainTx/status/1795831710501982657&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/AgainTx/status/1795831710501982657" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a clear road map</a></span> for what to expect during the shooter’s first year. Assuming nothing changes, these are the first four factions coming to the shooter over the next 12 months or so:</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Assassins from<em> Assassin’s Creed</em></li><li>Operators from <em>Ghost Recon Breakpoint</em></li><li>GSG9 members from<em> Rainbow Six Siege</em></li><li>The Highwaymen from <em>Far Cry: New Dawn</em></li></ul><p>Rogue TX was able to find in-game assets—<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/AgainTx/status/1795830729810788558&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/AgainTx/status/1795830729810788558" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">including icons</a></span>, map names, character renders, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/AgainTx/status/1783230832452186600&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/AgainTx/status/1783230832452186600" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">animations, and more</a></span>—indicating that <em>XDefiant</em>’s current plans for the coming year include these additions. (But keep in mind that plans change and game development is messy, so some or all of this might not happen.) </p><p>Beyond that, Rogue TX also found data suggesting that team deathmatch, capture the flag, and infection are new game modes that Ubisoft is currently planning to bring to <em>XDefiant </em>in a future update. Also found inside <em>XDefiant</em>’s files are some <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/AgainTx/status/1796137738967638290&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/AgainTx/status/1796137738967638290" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">possible new weapons</a></span>, including a sawed-off shotgun, Tommy Gun, FAMAS, turret, RC car, FAL, and G36 rifle. </p><p>But perhaps the weirdest stuff found by Rogue TX inside the game are indications that factions based on <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/AgainTx/status/1795941933539332534&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/AgainTx/status/1795941933539332534" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>The Crew</em></a></span>—Ubisoft’s open-world driving game—and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/AgainTx/status/1795508234683330573&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/AgainTx/status/1795508234683330573" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rabbids are planned, too</a></span>. How would that work? I have no idea. But as a Ubisoft sicko who plays and enjoys many of the publisher’s games, I’m excited for this wild mish-mash of content. Please, add a <em>Just Dance</em> faction, too! </p><p>If you are wondering if these leaks are real, Ubisoft has arguably lent them credence by <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/AgainTx/status/1796331539858645031&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/AgainTx/status/1796331539858645031" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reportedly using DMCA strikes</a></span> to remove some (<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/AgainTx/status/1796332800158699580&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/AgainTx/status/1796332800158699580" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">but weirdly not all</a></span>) of the datamined images and screenshots from Twitter. Some of Rogue’s images are now missing and display a message suggesting the copyright holder stepped in and removed them. </p><p><em>Kotaku </em>has contacted Ubisoft about the datamined content and <em>XDefiant</em>’s future. But for now, this seems to be our best look at the possible future of Ubisoft’s free-to-play FPS. </p><p>&nbsp;.<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

He says they set out to make the game, simply titled Astro Bot, to be big, adding that it represents more than just the start of Asobi’s new future with PlayStation.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>"This is really about going up one notch — really several notches — and having Astro's big story."</p></div><p>"We wanted to make a big game," Doucet said. "This is really about going up one notch — really several notches — and having Astro's big story. We call it Astro Bot because we treat this as a new beginning. That's a really, really big game. I think for us, that's the biggest game we've ever made."</p><p>PlayStation’s Astro Bot mascot has largely stayed out of the spotlight for the last few years. Some players may recognize the adorable little blue-and-white friend from the PSVR-exclusive Astro Bot Rescue Mission or, more recently, Astro’s Playroom, a game granted to PlayStation 5 owners for free. While these titles flew under the radar for many, they’ve still managed to impress those who checked them out (we gave Rescue Mission a <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2018/10/05/astro-bot-rescue-mission-review"><u>9/10</u></a> and <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/astros-playroom-ps5-review"><u>Playroom</u></a> an 8/10).</p><p>Astro Bot finally stepped up when the series’ standalone title was <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/new-astro-bot-game-revealed"><u>revealed during yesterday’s May 2024 State of Play presentation</u></a>. <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/05/30/astro-bot-arrives-on-ps5-september-6/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>PlayStation has already confirmed</u></a> the project features more than 80 levels that will see players trekking across forests, deserts, volcanos, and more. The footage we’ve seen so far teases an ambitious outing for Sony’s versatile little robot, but not everything is completely new.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Astro Bot will also continue a trend set up in previous installments by including references to other PlayStation titles. Where Astro’s Playroom had players digging for shoutouts to games from across the company’s history, yesterday’s reveal trailer put robot versions of characters like Nathan Drake, Kratos, Ico, and many more front and center. There’s no telling just how many easter eggs are waiting, especially considering Asobi teased that it doubled down on its cast this time around.</p><p>"It's a kind of eye candy," Doucet added. "There's going to be more. We're going to be talking over time about what they mean to the game, but, yes, there's going to be a big reunion. There's a lot of characters from the PlayStation universe crossing over with Astro's path. It's an Astro Bot story, of course, with Astro being the main character, but there's a lot of PlayStation characters that play a part."</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div><h3>Astro Bot Reveal Trailer Screenshots - State of Play 2024</h3></div></output><p>Asobi was officially <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/team-asobi-official-playstation-studios-dev-new-logo"><u>welcomed under the PlayStation umbrella in 2021</u></a>.

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/the-rogue-prince-of-persia-review-early-access</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-rogue-prince-of-persia-early-access-review-in-progress.886944/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/the-rogue-prince-of-persia-review-early-access<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>As a traditionally parkour-heavy series with a main character who often has a difficult time dying when it counts, a roguelike Prince of Persia game feels like a concept that was simply waiting for an execution. Pair that intuitive idea with Evil Empire, the developers behind <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2018/08/11/dead-cells-review">Dead Cells</a>, and you’ve got an ideal coupling for Ubisoft’s second sidescrolling Prince of Persia of 2024. But while The Rogue Prince of Persia has a lot of potential, at this stage in its Early Access life, there doesn’t seem to be quite enough to hang onto for this time loop adventure to really shine yet. I still have more to play before I put a final score on it, but what I’ve seen so far is a skeleton of a roguelite adventure that will entertain for a few hours, but already lacks the variety to motivate me beyond that.</p><p>The initial and easiest comparisons that can be made for The Rogue Prince of Persia are to assume it is either <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/prince-of-persia-the-lost-crown-review">The Lost Crown</a> with roguelite elements or Dead Cells with an emphasis on parkour movement, and neither of those descriptions wholly encompasses how it actually plays. Without losing its roguelite roots, this new go-round for the Prince puts more of an emphasis on the titular character’s fighting capabilities across a myriad of weapons. Enemies come in many shapes and forms, with both shielded and unshielded varieties, and require every technique at the Prince’s disposal to get through each fight unscathed. Every charge attack, drop attack, or vault over an enemy helps keep your health bar pristine until an inevitable boss fight. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div><h3>The Rogue Prince of Persia - Early Access Gameplay Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>The combat is so involved that it can end up feeling overwhelming at times. An unlucky fall into a group of enemies can be devastating to your life total, and even a good plan to destroy enemy shields can still fall apart when there are too many grouped up to discern between them. When two or three hits can completely decimate a run, it starts to feel like the platforming takes an unnecessary backseat to the combat.</p><p>The story, at the launch of Early Access, is edging on non-existent. The Prince wishes to save his kingdom from invading and seemingly magical Huns, so he takes off toward the castle with a magic bola in tow. The bola keeps returning him back in time to when he first set after the Huns, meaning that the Prince is afforded opportunity after opportunity to free his homeland. It also means he is forever stuck in a loop where he may never truly have enough time to make it there. It’s an intriguing setup that could be a great launching pad for more characters to steal the show, but there’s too little to grab onto currently.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>At this point, the supporting cast has no variety and no depth.</p></div><p>A cast of characters supports the Prince along the way, but at this point, they have no variety and no depth. Azadeh, the leader of the village you set out from, only has dialogue that feels vaguely nonsensical at the moment, clearly waiting until she can either be updated or given more lines before they make sense. Other characters move to the Prince’s camp, which protects those individuals from losing their memory while rewinding time, but very little is made of or by this convenient contrivance. There is plenty of time and opportunity to expand all of this in future updates, but it is a bit of a bummer to start the adventure and feel very little motivation to do right by this merry troupe of one-dimensional misfits.</p><p>At least The Rogue Prince of Persia is lovely to look at, styled like a Sasanian era painting come to life. Smooth animations and bright colors meld into a satisfying aesthetic, even if things look best while in motion and a little awkward when standing still. The environments not only look pleasant, but read well with necessary immediacy as you sprint and fight, which is important considering not every background surface lets you run on it to your heart’s content. I am somewhat puzzled as to why every character has purple skin, but I assume that is more of a stylistic choice than a malicious one. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>At this juncture, there is no voice acting to speak of for any of The Rogue Prince of Persia’s characters, including the Prince himself. This does not feel like a huge loss right now as there is very little story for actors to voice anyway. It doesn’t help the already flat characters feel any less paper-thin, though, and makes it that much easier to run past them without caring what they have to say.</p><p>The music is somewhat relaxed and in the background, never really taking focus away. It’s not bad, but it is a bit of a disappointment when held up against other Prince of Persia games. I can understand how anything bombastic might get tiring over repeated playthroughs, but I would still prefer some catchy tracks to go alongside running up walls and vaulting over enemy soldiers.. </p><p>However, all of the good and bad of specifics like that is largely a wash under the criticism that there is simply not enough at The Rogue Prince of Persia’s Early Access launch to hold my attention very long. It does not take more than a few hours to get strong enough through crafting and leveling up gear – which lets you do stuff like create pools of oil to stymie enemies or slowly poison them with clouds of gas – to surmount the first major boss, and the encounters after that follow suit. I genuinely had a fun time getting through the areas and fights that are currently available, but it’s hard to recommend for anyone who does not care about watching this adventure take shape. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>After 10 hours, I feel like I've more or less seen what it has to throw at me.</p></div><p>After about 10 hours, I feel like I have more or less seen what it has to throw at me. I expect the remainder of the Early Access period to introduce new areas, fights, items, and more, which is good because it definitely needs them. I am still pushing to get to the end of what’s here at launch before I give a final verdict, but I can already tell there is not enough variety – among encounters, among environments, among builds – to keep me entertained through the repeated runs this genre is supposed to be defined by.  </p><p>It will undoubtedly be fascinating to watch The Rogue Prince of Persia fill out as time goes on, as it ultimately needs more than just new content: It needs the kind of variety that makes each run feel truly different. With a slick presentation and a strong combat system, all the right pieces are there for success, so I’m at least optimistic. The Rogue Prince of Persia could have what it takes to one day become the next major roguelite favorite, but it’s a bit far from that goal where it sits now.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>If you haven't played the latest mainline Pokemon games, you can pick up the <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebay.com%2Fitm%2F196128828741%3Fmkcid%3D1%26mkrid%3D711-53200-19255-0%26siteid%3D0%26campid%3D5338974509%26toolid%3D20008%26mkevt%3D1&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fsave-big-on-pokemon-scarlet-and-violet-double-pack%2F1100-6509831%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Pokemon Scarlet and Violet Double Pack</a> for $90 on eBay. You're saving $30 off list price with this bundle ($15 per game). Scarlet and Violet are part of a small group of Switch games that only rarely drop below $50, so this is a pretty solid deal, especially if multiple members of your household like Pokemon. If this deal sells out, <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fgoto.walmart.com%2Fc%2F1804712%2F565706%2F9383%3Fveh%3Daff%26sourceid%3Dimp_000011112222333344%26u%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FPokemon-Scarlet-Pokemon-Violet-Dual-Pack-Nintendo-Switch%2F1545999884%3Ffrom%3D%2Fsearch%26subId1%3Dsubid_value&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fsave-big-on-pokemon-scarlet-and-violet-double-pack%2F1100-6509831%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Walmart has the bundle for $100</a>.</p><p>You don't have to play both of them to get the full Pokemon experience, so if you're looking to share the experience with a friend or family member, here's an easy way to do so. Plus, you'll be able to easily trade the Pokemon that are exclusive to each game.</p><p>While there are still some technical issues with the first truly open world entry in the series, Pokemon Scarlet and Violet is still a great entry in the series and features dozens of new Pokemon to catch, raise, and evolve as you explore a new land influenced by the sunny environments of Spain.</p><p>"While Pokemon Legends: Arceus dipped its toes into what an open-world Pokemon game could be, Pokemon Scarlet and Violet fully embrace it," Jake Dekker wrote in GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/pokemon-scarlet-violet-review-a-braviary-new-world/1900-6417994/">Pokemon Scarlet and Violet review</a>. "This new approach to the tried-and-true Pokemon formula reinvigorates the mainline series and delivers one of the most challenging and rewarding Pokemon adventures to date."</p><p>It's worth noting that this double pack does not contain the two Scarlet and Violet expansions. If you're eager to play the complete Scarlet and Violet experience, there are physical editions of each game that come with DLC vouchers.

data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Violet bundles</a> cost $95 each, as the expansion pass goes for $35--so you'll have to pay full price for each.</p><p>If you're feeling

                <p dir="ltr">343 is finally adding Match Composer to<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/halo-infinite/"> Halo Infinite</a>, a multiplayer feature previously seen in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-master-chief-collection/">The Master Chief Collection</a> that makes finding a game much easier. Match Composer will launch alongside the latest Operation on June 4.</p><p dir="ltr">As explained in a<a href="https://www.halowaypoint.com/news/match-composer-preview" rel="nofollow "> Halo blog post</a>, Match Composer is a feature that allows players to find very specific kinds of matches. For example, if someone is looking for Team Slayer, a 4v4 game, all they have to do is select those, and they'll be launched into a queue looking for that specific game type.</p><p dir="ltr">The blog post explains that every mode will be turned on by default. So, players must turn off which game modes they don't want to look for. It's worth pointing out that if players are looking for a very specific game, it may take longer to find a match than someone with every mode turned on.</p><p>It's also worth mentioning that most social playlists will have Match Composer, but players cannot use this feature when playing Ranked. Since Match Composer will not be in Ranked, the following modes will be expanded: Ranked Arena, Ranked Slayer, Ranked Doubles, and Ranked Tactical.</p><p dir="ltr">For more Halo content, check out <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/get-halo-limited-edition-needler-nerf-blaster-for-lowest-price-yet-while-supplies-last/1100-6518314/">our story detailing how you can get your hands on a Needler Nerf Blaster for a discounted price</a>.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/warframe-jade-shadows-release-date-new-mode-and-more.886926/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/warframe-jade-shadows-release-date-new-mode-and-more/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=warframe-jade-shadows-release-date-new-mode-and-more<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="239" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Jade Shadows is the next known update coming to <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/tag/warframe/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Warframe</a></em>, revisiting the Stalker, introducing the new frame, and significant reworks in the game’s mechanics. In the 180th DevStream, we had a good look into what’s to come in the update.</p> <h2 id="h-warframe-jade-shadows-release-date" data-injectable="false"><em>Warframe </em>Jade Shadows release date</h2> <p data-characters="255" data-current-count="255" data-injectable="false">The Jade Shadows update will be coming to <em>Warframe </em>on <strong>June 18 on all platforms</strong>. It’ll be in the style of a typical update where we get a quest, a new frame, a new game mode, new weapons, balance changes, quality-of-life improvements, and several tweaks.</p> <figure data-current-count="555" data-injectable="true"><p> <iframe title="Warframe | Jade Shadows Official Teaser" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Wvtic5hMEd0?feature=oembed&amp;enablejsapi=1&amp;origin=https://www.destructoid.com" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure>
 <h2 data-injectable="false">What to expect in Jade Shadows</h2> <p data-characters="210" data-current-count="210" data-injectable="false">While this may be a traditional <em>Warframe </em>update, <strong>Jade Shadows will be a cinematic quest that will last roughly up to 25 minutes</strong>. It’ll focus on what happens to The Stalker post-New War while introducing Jade.</p> <p data-characters="268" data-current-count="478" data-injectable="true">Because of this, you will have to progress through the game’s questline up until the completion of The New War. The dev team at Digital Extremes also requests that <strong>players be mindful of spoilers when this is released</strong>, so it’ll be important for upcoming expansions.</p>
 <h2 data-injectable="false">Status rework</h2> <p data-characters="295" data-current-count="295" data-injectable="false">One of the bigger tweaks coming in this update has to be the <strong>rework to the Blast, Cold, and Magnetic status effects</strong>. Right now, the elements pertaining to Toxin and its combinations reign supreme along with Fire. The aforementioned procs are to be reworked in a way that brings them up to snuff.</p> <p data-characters="162" data-current-count="457" data-injectable="true">It’s too soon to tell if this will flip the meta entirely, but it does already sound like it’s making every elemental combination viable in the endgame.&nbsp;</p>
 <h2 data-injectable="false"><em>Warframe </em>Jade Shadows new game mode</h2> <p data-characters="250" data-current-count="250" data-injectable="false">Along with the quest and status rework, there will be a new game mode coming to Warframe called <strong>“Ascension”</strong>. It seems to be a multiple-phase game mode where you first defend an objective, then go into an elevator and escort an objective with you.</p> <p data-characters="241" data-current-count="491" data-injectable="true">From this elevator part, you have to power the mechanism up with batteries while avoiding a bunch of hazards and hard-hitting enemies. Should you fall or mess up, you must climb back up and maintain the energy of the elevator going upward.&nbsp;</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Digital Extremes</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="158" data-current-count="458" data-injectable="true">The final part seems to borrow from the mechanics of the Hijack mode where you then have to escort a moving payload and prevent it from being destroyed.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="207" data-current-count="207" data-injectable="false">So, in short, this game mode will require players to be very mobile, utilizing all the movement techniques in <em>Warframe</em>. At the same time, they have to sport a decent build that can take down tough enemies.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="165" data-current-count="372" data-injectable="false">There will also be an event tied to this mode as the update comes out called<strong> Belly of the Beas</strong>t. Rewards include Arcane Enhancements from previous events and more.&nbsp;</p> <h2 data-injectable="false">Additional things coming with Jade Shadows</h2> <p data-characters="229" data-current-count="601" data-injectable="true">There will be huge <strong>UI improvements</strong> coming to Jade Shadows like missions depicting enemy resistance and weaknesses. You’ll also be able to edit your loadout while at the Star Chart menu for a more streamlined mission approach.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="207" data-current-count="207" data-injectable="false">Many more improvements to the new user experience will be made that will benefit veterans too. Such things include damage numbers and how they’re displayed, polarity matching, fast travel menus, and more. </p> <p data-characters="199" data-current-count="406" data-injectable="false">Finally, we’ll be getting <strong>new Augment mods for Protea, Qorvex, Dagath, and Sevagoth</strong>. There’s so much to unpack for fans of the upcoming frame and those who will be affected by the status reworks.</p>

<div id="nDj02J"><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/d0oiJJRZF4I?rel=0" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share;"></iframe></p></div>
<p id="mrF5WC">The game doesn’t have a release date yet, but developer Papergames announced at State of Play that testing will begin in Q3 of 2024. The trailer includes tons of elements to get excited about: incredibly sharp AAA-level graphics, whimsical settings and costumes, and pastel-washed puzzles and challenges. Plus the game will be available on PS5 as soon as it’s released.</p>
<p id="BSF1fA">But folks might be even more excited about <em>Infinity Nikki</em> after watching clips from IGN reporter Daniel Robson’s three-hour demo of the game. <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/infinity-nikki-the-first-hands-on-preview">Robson’s preview</a> includes tons of exciting artwork and cutscenes from the game, but the glowing review of the gameplay is what will likely get both Legend of Zelda players and <em>Love Nikki</em> fans excited to get their hands on this for themselves.</p>

<p id="WJwQ7g">Robson says players will be able to customize the lead character’s outfits to a degree that rivals <em>Animal Crossing: New Horizons</em>, and then use a high-powered in-game camera to shoot cute photos of them. You’ll have plenty of opportunities to enjoy the sun-bleached landscape (as Robson calls it “Hyrule as interpreted by Studio Ghibli”) from your perch on a magical glider, ride your bike through the countryside, and use your tools to catch materials for crafting new clothes and items.</p>
<p id="xQwb5I">The cheek-pinching cuteness of the game doesn’t take away from its weight as a challenging and engaging game, though (a dynamic other cozy open-worlds often suffer from, in my opinion). Robson reports that the Zelda-like puzzles and “shrines” are challenging without being frustrating, and well worth the payoff at the end — stunning animations that show off the level you’ve just beat. </p>
<p id="kFhmDU">There’s also some combat, including battles with monsters and other creatures that drop materials you can use to sketch and craft new outfits. The game will also eventually include online features, but IGN reported they won’t be available at launch.</p>
<p id="CNalOF">As aforementioned, <em>Infinity Nikki</em> developers say it’ll be ready for testing around July 2024, and it’ll debut on PS5 at launch. IGN previously reported that the game will also be available on PC, Xbox Series X, iOS, and Android, but the developers haven’t released an official full list of consoles.</p>

To some, this moment means everything, but there are others who couldn’t even begin to understand the magnitude of it all. That’s because <em>Destiny</em>’s lore, much as I love it, is nearly impossible to glean in obvious ways.

Every major plot beat in the game, from the earliest moments of the first <em>Destiny </em>all the way to the currently ending season, has made the cut. Even elements of story that occur before the first game are featured in the video.

The events of the original title make up the shortest parts of the video, accounting for about five chapters over the course of about an hour. The bulk of the story really begins to kick into gear at the beginning of <em>Destiny 2</em>, once Bungie more or less figured out a direction for the more ambiguous elements of the franchise, like the enigmatic Darkness, and introduced seasonal stories, which are coincidentally <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/destiny-2-final-shape-seasons-episode-burnout-eververse-1850762447&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/destiny-2-final-shape-seasons-episode-burnout-eververse-1850762447">being phased out</a></span> next week.</p><p><em>Destiny </em>has always had <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/the-best-story-from-destiny-s-hidden-lore-1728113953&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/the-best-story-from-destiny-s-hidden-lore-1728113953">incredibly Cool™ lore</a></span>, but both installments in the series have fumbled its presentation. The first game would direct players to read Grimoire cards—which contained dense and pulpy sci-fi novellas—that could only be found on the <em>Destiny </em>app, meaning there was little to no way for anyone to find the game’s most interesting writing within <em>Destiny </em>itself. <em>Destiny 2 </em>has done a much better job of giving players codexes that are packed with books detailing ongoing conflicts and other interesting lore tidbits from around the galaxy. However, these tomes are buried beneath <em>Destiny 2</em>’s poor and convoluted UI, which only gets worse the more you look at it, and is fortunately being streamlined in <em>The Final Shape</em>, among <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/destiny-2-the-final-shape-power-bungie-difficulty-1851436397&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/destiny-2-the-final-shape-power-bungie-difficulty-1851436397">countless</a></span> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/destiny-2-final-shape-bounty-changes-1851470573&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/destiny-2-final-shape-bounty-changes-1851470573">other</a></span> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/destiny-2-final-shape-bounty-changes-1851470573&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/destiny-2-final-shape-bounty-changes-1851470573">changes</a></span>.<br></p><p>While Bungie’s toiled away at mechanisms to better implement its own interesting background stories into the actual <em>Destiny </em>games, it has also been telling an ongoing story with <em>a lot </em>of moving parts and big ol’ proper nouns. Matters have only worsened on this front considering how many stories have been stripped from the game and tossed into a vault, like all of <em>Destiny 2</em>’s seasonal storytelling and the vanilla campaign that it launched with! It’s hard to manage a game, but it is even harder to get into <em>Destiny </em>and its narrative due to how acutely its developers have bungled it all in the ensuing years.

Whenever I’ve fallen away from the game, Byf’s lore videos have always managed to get me caught back up and reminded me of one of the reasons I’ve loved these games for almost ten years.

                <p dir="ltr">As Sony continues to bring many of its acclaimed PlayStation console exclusives to PC, each release seems to be getting better in terms of quality and stability. Ghost of Tsushima is the latest to uphold this trend, with developer Nixxes showing yet again how valuable of a purchase it was in the pursuit of this PC-focused endeavor. Taking the work done by Sucker Punch on the PlayStation 4 and translating it to a smooth PC experience might sound trivial in the face of more demanding projects such as Returnal and Ratchet and Clank: Rift Apart, but it doesn't make the final product any less impressive when you're able to get it running far beyond even the PlayStation 5 version's level of visuals and performance.</p><div

PSN account to play) and the entertaining <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/ghost-of-tsushima-iki-island-expansion-review-sins-of-the-father/1900-6417714/">Iki Island DLC</a> that extends protagonist Jin Sakai's adventure. There's a lot to play here, especially taking into account the scope of the main adventure. It's a story that takes some time to get going, but fully earns its pacing through moments such as the breath-taking late title card screen and captivating set-piece battles that bookend its main acts. Ghost of Tsushima's open-world design feels slightly old given the time since its original release, but it's no less captivating to make your way across the gorgeous island the game takes place on.</p><p dir="ltr">On PC, Tsushima looks better than ever, too. There are some small improvements that help its visuals surpass those of the PS5 version, including some upgrades to volumetric fog and smaller visual enhancements to make the world look sharper to the eye. It's hard to pick these out without a direct comparison to the console version, however, with Nixxes holding back large changes such as ray-traced lighting or global illumination, which is disappointing given how both have become commonplace in modern games. Ghost of Tsushima side-steps its age with a timeless visual design. Colors are vibrant and accentuated, bringing to life forests laden with warm autumn hues and providing an eye-catching contrast between the lush wildlife and the oppressive Mongol structures that have started infecting it.</p><p dir="ltr">Exploring this world is improved significantly with the additional fluidity that playing on PC can offer. On my AMD Ryzen 5600X and RTX 3080 Ti, I was pleasantly surprised to see such high frame rates at much higher resolutions than the PS5 could offer, with a native 4K hovering well above 80fps for much of my playtime. This gives Ghost of Tsushima a lot of room for scaling down to much older hardware, albeit with the caveat that it plays best on graphics cards with more than 8GB of VRAM, which can be a limiting factor. Still, the range of visual settings on offer lets you refine your experience to achieve the performance you want, with real-time changes to the world letting you sample your tweaks as you make them in the menu. Ghost of Tsushima felt great on PS4, was vastly improved with its 60fps mode on PS5, but feels transformative at even higher refresh rates if you have the display to support it.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4311327-ghostoftsushimadcpc.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4311327" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4311327-ghostoftsushimadcpc.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4311327"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4311327-ghostoftsushimadcpc.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">A wide range of hardware is also supported in terms of resolution scaling features, with support for Nvidia's DLSS, AMD's FSR, and Intel XeSS super-sampling solutions. In addition, you can make use of Sucker Punch's own TAA solution with dynamic resolution scaling, which matches how the PlayStation handles the game, although it's a much less refined option than those offered by PC graphics cards. More surprising still is the decoupling of AMD's hardware agnostic frame generation solution, letting you pair it up with Nvidia's DLSS for the first time (officially) in a PC title. This means that you don't need a modern Nvidia 40-series card to enjoy the benefits of frame generation, which can nearly double your frame rate without much perceivable latency. There are some issues with image quality if you look hard enough, as the generated frames are injected between natively rendered ones, but they're minor enough that I played with the setting enabled for most of my time. This won't magically transform the game into a 60fps one if you are struggling to sustain that level of performance, however, as you'll have the best results with the game running there or higher already.</p><p dir="ltr">Between its scalable performance and robust range of settings, Ghost of Tsushima is another feather in the cap of Nixxes' work with PlayStation exclusives. Even if it's without some big improvements over its console counterpart, it's nonetheless a great way to experience one of the most visually striking open worlds on the market today despite its age, with the dangers and wonders of Tsushima island still a delight to experience for the first time.</p>

<p data-characters="168" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Once you find Slurp Cactus in<em> Fortnite, </em>they can help you gain shields and finish a weekly quest. Here’s where to spot them in this big battle royale open world. </p> <h2 id="h-slurp-cactus-in-fortnite-location" data-injectable="false">Slurp Cactus in Fortnite location</h2> <p data-characters="453" data-current-count="453" data-injectable="true">The Slurp Cactus is a new interactive object in <em>Fortnite</em> that lets you gain shields after ramming it with a vehicle or hitting it with a weapon. They can be found all over the new desert area to the south of the <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/fortnite-season-3-wrecked-slams-the-brakes-on-the-fun/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Chapter 5 Season 3</a> map. Find a car near a location like the Nitrodome and while driving, look on both sides of the road. You’ll see cacti that have blue gooey leaves on them. Ram into these plants and you’ll gain a shield boost. </p>

Once this is completed, you’ll net yourself 15,000 XP. It also accounts for the bonus goals, which ask you to complete a certain amount of Weekly Quests. If you finish 12, for example, there is a 25K experience bonus.</p>

Nitro Fists are a new weapon in the game that let you punch your foes to elimination. Get 400 damage with the Nitro Fists, and you’ll get yourself another 15K experience points. The best way to take them out is to uppercut them, then smash your fists down while you’re in the air. </p> <p data-characters="236" data-current-count="600" data-injectable="false">Additionally, you can damage opponents with your car by either ramming them or <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/how-to-mod-vehicle-fortnite/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">modding a weapon</a> to the top of your vehicle. You can collect them from boxes strewn throughout the map.

Amazon lists the release date as August 9, while Play Asia lists it for August 5. You will, however, get it sooner from Amazon if you live in the US, simply because you'll be importing from overseas at Play Asia. </p><p>The Tears of the Kingdom original soundtrack includes over 200 tracks across nine discs. Each disc features gorgeous Zelda iconography and comes with a large, decorative storage case.</p><p>Note: Play Asia's price is $72 plus shipping and import fees, while Amazon's price is $136, at least for the time being. If you preorder from Amazon now, you won't be charged until your order ships in August. Plus, you will pay the lowest price offered between the time you order and release. It's <em>highly </em>unlikely this soundtrack will actually sell for $136 on Amazon. We'd expect it to drop significantly--close to Play Asia's price--before release. So you could secure your preorder now and cancel later if the launch price is too high.</p><p>That said, we wouldn't be surprised if this edition sells out, so you may want to secure your preorder and then cancel later if you think the launch price is too high.</p></div>                      </div>                                                                     <div>             <h2>                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D2RZGSTS?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/B0D2RZGSTS?tag=gamespot-preorders-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0D2RZGSTS?tag=gamespot-preorders-20">The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom Original Soundtrack Collector's Edition</a>       </h2>                                                                                                                         <div><p>Step up to the collector's edition and you'll get the same nine discs as the standard edition as well as a stylish Master Sword USB Player with 15 additional tracks. You'll also get a case with an exclusive design, giving you an easy way to store the volume when not in use.</p><p>Note: Amazon is currently charging $194 for the collector's edition version of the Tears of the Kingdom soundtrack (versus $120 plus import fees at Play Asia). Just like with the standard edition, it's unlikely you'll actually wind up spending $194. That said, we would expect this edition to sell out, so you may want to secure your preorder and then cancel your order closer to launch if you decide against getting it.</p></div>                      </div>   </div><p>While you're waiting for these to ship, consider checking out the existing collection of Zelda soundtracks. This includes music from Wind Waker, Majora's Mask, and Breath of the Wild. For good measure, we've also tossed in two great Mario soundtracks--one of which was released to celebrate the series' 30th anniversary. Most of these soundtracks have limited stock and prices fluctuate frequently.</p><h2>Best Nintendo Soundtrack Deals</h2><ul><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07B51QV1D?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Zelda: Breath of the Wild Soundtrack</a> -- $44</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Legend-Zelda-Links-Awakening-Soundtrack/dp/B084Z9V1WW?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Zelda: Link's Awakening Soundtrack</a> -- $36</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Legend-Zelda-30Th-Anniversary-Concert/dp/B01N4D1161?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Zelda: 30th Anniversary Concert</a> -- $27</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Legend-Zelda-Skyward-Sword-Regular/dp/B09G71ZN1T?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Zelda: Skyward Sword Soundtrack</a> -- $51</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Legend-Zelda-Waker-Original-Soundtrack/dp/B000BD768U?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Zelda: Wind Waker Soundtrack</a> -- $48</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Legend-Zelda-Majoras-Original-Soundtrack/dp/B0118AA54Q?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Zelda: Majora's Mask Soundtrack</a> -- $40</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00P97PQ1M?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Zelda: A Link Between Worlds Soundtrack</a> -- $47</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Shuunen-Kinen-Super-Mario-Music/dp/B013JNSIE4?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Super Mario Bros Music: 30th Anniversary</a> -- $27</li><li><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Super-Mario-Odyssey-Original-Music/dp/B078HF56HQ?tag=gamespot-promos-20Get" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Super Mario Odyssey Soundtrack</a> -- $34</li></ul><div data-embed-type="pinbox" data-ref-id="4304">  <ul>                              <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mad-max-5-film-limited-edition-4k-collection-and-furiosa-steelbook-up-for-preorder/1100-6523703/">Mad Max 5-Film Limited Edition 4K Collection And Furiosa Steelbook Up For Preorder</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cuphead-delicious-last-course-art-book-has-never-before-seen-content-limited-edition-up-for-preorder/1100-6523733/">Cuphead Delicious Last Course Art Book Has Never-Before-Seen Content, Limited Edition Up For Preorder</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-sports-college-football-25-preorder-guide-ps5-xbox-series-x/1100-6523506/">Walmart Has An Exclusive Edition For EA Sports College Football 25</a></li>                          <li>         <span>+ Show More Best Gaming &amp; Tech Deals This Week Links (4)</span>       </li>          <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/paper-mario-thousand-year-door-nintendo-switch-preorder-guide/1100-6521751/">Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door Preorders - Release-Day Delivery Still Available</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/save-over-60-on-12-months-of-xbox-game-pass-ultimate-with-targets-limited-time-deal/1100-6523230/">Save Over $60 On 12 Months Of Xbox Game Pass Ultimate With Target's Limited-Time Deal</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-world-championships-nes-edition-preorder-guide-nintendo-switch/1100-6523267/">Nintendo World Championships Deluxe Set Preorders Are Only Available At Select Retailers</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-portal-restock-guide/1100-6520876/">PlayStation Portal Is Back In Stock At Multiple Major Retailers</a></li>   </ul> </div>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gamedeveloper.com/audio/game-audio-overview-sound-effects-for-games<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="captioned-content"><p><span>Via Francesco Paggiaro on Pexels</span></p></div><div data-module="content" data-testid="article-base-body-content"><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Introduction to game audio">Introduction to game audio</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Game audio has the power to define the identity of a game and to drive its success. From realistic sound effects that build atmosphere to instantly recognizable themes and voiceovers that become synonymous with the title, game audio can enhance gameplay to create enchanting and memorable games that stand the test of time.</span></p><h3 data-testid="content-text" id="The evolution of game audio">The evolution of game audio</h3><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Audio has come a long way since Alan Blumlein first invented what we now call “stereo” in the 1930s. As technology has advanced, so has the complexity of game audio design.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Early game audio was severely constrained by the technology of the day. Hardware such as oscillators and synthesizers churned out a variety of simple beeps and tones that nonetheless managed to resonate with players, and have stuck with them decades later.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The mid-1980s brought MIDI technology, a standard protocol that enabled a new wave of more complex, dynamic and exciting melodies and sounds to be made. MIDI tracks could use different instruments and form harmonies, which added a new dimension to game music. It brought us another step closer to adaptive game audio, tailored to different game stages, actions or moods.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The 1990s brought us the CD-ROM and, with it, a new level of sound quality. Game audio became more realistic, cinematic and immersive. Audio cues were harnessed to guide players’ actions and dialogue became crystal clear. This was also the era in which plenty of licensed music made its way into games, with the soundtracks to titles such as </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Tony Hawk’s Pro Skater, Gran Turismo</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Grand Theft Auto</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> all featuring songs by chart-topping artists.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The 2000s saw 3D game audio and graphics really taking off. Technology such as surround sound and positional audio was paired with techniques such as modulation and mixing to create more visceral, responsive environments. These all amped up the excitement and the immersion of games.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">3D environments are often now a given, so today’s game audio composers face the unique challenge of creating sound that responds to players’ actions in these spaces.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This is even more complicated for virtual reality (VR) games. The human brain registers sonic discrepancies when we move our heads, so game audio must be equally responsive, complementing head tracking when wearing a VR headset. Other factors audio designers working on VR games may now need to consider are whether to opt for diegetic or non-diegetic sound, how to balance player comfort with player performance and even how game audio can be used as a tool to reduce visually induced motion sickness (VIMS).</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">VR is an extremely exciting area for game audio industry players to explore. Game audio experts are being given the room to experiment with the tools and techniques they need to use to create seamless and immersive virtual environments. Innovative audio solutions will be necessary to keep pace with the ever-changing VR technology landscape.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Beyond VR, there are equally as exciting opportunities arising in the audio gaming space. With no visual elements for context clues, audio games, such as </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Papa Sangre</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The Nightjar</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> immerse players in audio-only environments; listeners play a role in the world-building as they must use their imaginations to determine the origins of the sounds they are hearing, drawing them in in a particularly captivating and inclusive way.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Understanding the different types of game audio">Understanding the different types of game audio</h2><h3 data-testid="content-text" id="Background music">Background music</h3><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Background music is the soundtrack to the game. This element of game audio has a particular influence on players’ emotions, which is integral to their immersion in and enjoyment of the game.</span></p><h3 data-testid="content-text" id="SFX">SFX</h3><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Sound effects (SFX) are all the sounds that objects make in a game (think ambient sounds, the two-note trill of Mario collecting a coin in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Super Mario Bros</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, the sounds you hear when you select an option on a menu and the pained cry of an opponent struck by a deadly blow). They provide an extra dimension to the game audio, enhancing the soundscape, providing instant feedback and reinforcing the actions onscreen.</span></p><h3 data-testid="content-text" id="Voiceovers">Voiceovers</h3><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Voiceovers are character lines, announcements, dialogue, or narration. Game developers include character lines in their game audio to help us perceive characters’ moods, intentions, personalities and even cultural clues, enabling us to distinguish them from other characters. Narration and announcements can also help provide additional context, guiding players through the game and immersing them in the story.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Mastering the art of background music in games">Mastering the art of background music in games</h2><h3 data-testid="content-text" id="Appropriate selection of background music">Appropriate selection of background music</h3><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The best background music works in harmony with the visual, auditory and tactile elements of the game. It can heighten the emotion and the depth of the action onscreen, making it a crucial element of game audio. Its length, tempo, style and genre must seamlessly match that of each stage of the game to drive the narrative and fully take the player along with you on the game’s journey. Therefore, game developers need to consider what kind of music will best evoke the players’ emotions and their immersion in the game at every juncture. The main melodies should have just enough variations to surprise the player, keeping them engaged. For this reason, game audio composers tend to work with two to three themes. They can adapt each theme or motif to a certain level, stage, or character in the game, adding color and reflecting their unique characteristics while reducing player fatigue and maintaining the game’s overall sense of identity.</span></p><h3 data-testid="content-text" id="The impact of background music on gameplay experience">The impact of background music on gameplay experience</h3><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Background music adds depth and variety to the gaming experience. It works in synergy with other game audio elements and the game’s visual effects to create a multi-sensory impact, enriching the players’ interaction with the game world. It is a great tool for world-building: take, for example, “Dragonborn,” the iconic background music in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. Its pulsing war drums, paired with epic strings, horns and deep vocals, really help build the world of icy tundra, ancient palaces and weapon-wielding dragon descendants, adding a sense of excitement. It can also help with storytelling, intensifying players’ intrigue and connection with the game’s characters: the background music in the adventure game </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>What Remains of Edith Finch</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, for example, gradually becomes richer as each character’s imagination evolves.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Ultimately, when done right, background music can take the game to new heights: game audio playlists and fan covers of prolific background music tracks have become more widespread in recent years, expanding the reach of their respective games.&nbsp;</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Integrating sound effects with game mechanics">Integrating sound effects with game mechanics</h2><h3 data-testid="content-text" id="Role of sound effects in video games">Role of sound effects in video games</h3><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Sound effects are integral to video game design: they provide an auditory canvas for all other game audio elements, such as dialogue and music. Incorporating ambient sounds into game audio can help with world-building, and spot effects, such as footsteps or weapon loading, can provide important gameplay feedback, influencing the players’ strategies and actions. Overall, sound effects contribute to the sensory richness of the game, helping immerse players in the gameplay by amplifying the onscreen actions or events, bringing immediacy and presence to the environment and reinforcing the game’s narrative.</span></p><h3 data-testid="content-text" id="The science of associating sounds with actions">The science of associating sounds with actions</h3><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The relationship between sound and gesture has never been more pronounced: you push a button on your microwave and expect to hear some audio feedback. You fire up your streaming app, and you expect a welcome tone. If you hear a sound you’re not expecting to hear during that process, the brain registers that something has likely gone wrong, encouraging you to troubleshoot. You try the same process again or try a different strategy to see if you get different results. Some sound effects are so ingrained into our psyches that we no longer need a visual cue to identify what they are calling for us to do: take the Windows XP error sound effect, a call to action so prolific that 10 years after the product reached the end of its life, we can hear it in countless social media skits and know exactly what the creator is trying to tell us—and not a computer in sight. Harnessing this phenomenon, game audio professionals often link specific game actions with an audio cue, with repetition reinforcing it for the players.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Examples include sounds related to selecting different options in a menu, the swish of a karate kick, the often-descending sound motif of a player falling, perishing, or the dreaded game over. Action-associated sounds are a type of feedback—one of the most effective ways to guide players through the game. These game audio cues tell players what they should or shouldn’t do (in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Pac-Man</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, do eat the dots, don’t touch the ghosts, with different sounds presenting for each, for example) and how well they are progressing through the game. Over time, the players form these associations in their minds and can subconsciously use them to influence their next moves, focusing their attention and enhancing their gameplay.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Exploring a variety of in-game notifications">Exploring a variety of in-game notifications</h2><h3 data-testid="content-text" id="Game notifications – from level completion to game over">Game notifications – from level completion to game over</h3><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Music is known to drive mood. Our brains release happy chemicals such as dopamine and serotonin when we hear upbeat, joyful sounds and game audio experts can use this to reward players’ efforts.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Players often put in a great deal of effort to beat each level of a game. Anywhere else in life, you’d expect such effort to be rewarded. The failure to recognize an achievement in the game can render it a bit of a damp squib. To maintain player morale and motivate them to keep challenging themselves in the game all the way to the end, game audio professionals should build in at least some level of fanfare, ready and waiting to praise those who dare to fight their way through all the obstacles and make it to the next level. If the player has succeeded in completing a level—or, better still, completing the whole game—the trumpets of triumph can work hand in hand with onscreen graphics to lift players’ spirits, an aural pat on the back that strengthens their sense of achievement while wrapping up and drawing a line under that stage of the game. When players fail to complete a level, game audio experts should harness game over sounds to motivate players to regroup, take a breath and ultimately increase their desire or determination to try again.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="conclusion">conclusion</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Game audio should be careful, considered and enthralling. Music, dialogue and sound effects are the very heartbeat of any game, driving its narrative and fully immersing players in its realm. The future of the game audio sector is bright, promising even more innovative soundscapes, new technologies, interactive sound effects and immersive techniques that will further enhance the gaming experience.</span></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p data-characters="186" data-injectable="true" data-video="true"><em>Senua’s Saga: Hellblade 2</em> got its first-ever patch today, addressing a myriad of issues and, finally, the misaligned peach fuzz on Senua’s face. Wait. Who notices that stuff?</p> <p data-characters="473" data-current-count="473" data-injectable="true">Anyway, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2461850/view/4166471769756034428" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Hellblade 2</em> patch 1.0.5.0</a> is a small one, bringing around 20 fixes and changes to the game. Among the changes is one I feel is the most important for those who already finished the game. From now on, choosing the ‘New Story’ option in the menu will warn you that the feature will indeed reset your current progress. It didn’t say this before, no doubt prompting some to reassess using the option. I do wonder how many save files got wiped, though.</p>

Among the former and the New Story warning above, the patch also fixes memory leaks, ghosting issues, mission captions, and some artifacting when using FSR3. There is also one fix that kinda spoils an event near the end of the game, so I’d suggest you avoid reading the patch notes directly. </p> <p data-characters="69" data-current-count="454" data-injectable="true">I’ll post them below, sans spoilers (courtesy of Ninja Theory):</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/call-of-duty-will-do-9-11-and-other-summer-game-fest-predictions.886851/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/aftermath-hours-podcast-summer-game-fest-predictions<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Somehow, even though Christmas was literally yesterday, Summer Game Fest – aka Keigh-3 – is almost upon us. Which B- and C-list celebrities will grace Geoff Keighley’s stage? Which triple-A games that won’t be out for another five years will debut their logos? Will Geoff finally acknowledge <a href="https://kotaku.com/geoff-keighley-layoffs-tweets-sgf-summer-game-fest-1851332390" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">(outside Twitter</a>) the layoffs that have plagued an alarming percentage of the companies whose floats populate his hype parade? On this week’s Aftermath Hours, we discuss all that and more.</p><p>On this week’s episode, Chris, Riley, and I huddle together after another week surviving the slow-mo media apocalypse, this time with (even) more AI. First we discuss Vox Media and The Atlantic’s mystifying decision to <a href="https://aftermath.site/openai-vox-atlantic-ai-journalism-jobs-sam-altman" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">feed their journalists’ work into OpenAI’s woodchipper</a>, shredding years of credibility and goodwill in exchange for a quick buck. Then we talk about <a href="https://aftermath.site/sony-druckmann-interview" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sony’s Neil Druckmann interview</a>, which the company ended up pulling after the<em> Last of Us</em> maestro revealed that he was egregiously misquoted. Maybe having people who are not journalists try to create journalism-coded content is… bad?&nbsp;</p><p>After that, we make our predictions for this year’s Summer Game Fest. Is <em>Call of Duty</em> gonna <a href="https://x.com/WarzoneAlerts/status/1793746626349347319" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">do 9/11</a>? Absolutely. Is Hideo Kojima going to make some kind of appearance? Without a doubt. Is BioWare going to show actual footage of either<em> Dragon Age: Dreadwolf</em> or the next <em>Mass Effect</em>, rather than one of its trademark videos of art and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZJPvKbUgOA&amp;t=154s" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">some guys talking in the woods</a>? That is… less certain. Finally, we finish out by trying to decide who we’d replace Geoff with if we could pick somebody else to host every consequential video game event under the sun. Our picks may shock you (but probably not).</p><p>You can find this week's episode below and on <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/7qtlX6MNeEoyNuHBU0chUJ?si=a2f12b75911f43cb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Spotify</a>, <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/aftermath-hours/id1727407094" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Apple</a>, or wherever else you prefer to listen to podcasts. If you like what you hear, make sure to leave a review so that one day we, the staff of Aftermath, can take over hosting duties at Summer Game Fest (and then immediately hand the reins back to Geoff because that job seems hard).</p><p>Here’s an excerpt from our conversation:</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> Alright, let’s officially transition into doing our predictions for Summer Game Fest, which is not Summer Games Fest, even though it should be called Summer Games – plural – Fest.</p><p><strong>Riley:</strong> It’s confusing! Why is there no S? I have to look this up every time, and it drives me bonkers. Put an S in there, for goodness’ sake.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> Off the top, because I took down notes for this; I love to prepare for things. I love doing homework. Anyway, main prediction – this is in my notes – “It’s gonna be a giant letdown, like always.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Riley:</strong> I was thinking about this, and all the things I always hope to see in an E3 – like oh, maybe there’ll be a <a href="https://aftermath.site/bethesda-closure-microsoft-arkane" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new <em>Dishonored</em></a><em> </em>or a <a href="https://aftermath.site/eidos-deus-ex-embracer" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new<em> Deus Ex</em> </a>– we’re not getting either of those! And I had this moment of: what is there even to look forward to?&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> I also think that Keighley tends to save all of his bombshells for The Game Awards. For Summer Game Fest, we just kind of get some stuff that’s coming this fall.</p><p><strong>Riley: </strong>I can’t remember last year.</p><p><strong>Nathan: </strong>Yeah, you can’t remember last year because there was not really anything of note. It was all OK. That’s what it’s always like.&nbsp;</p><p>Will someone rush the stage? I doubt it. Keighley probably has fucking snipers up there now.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Riley: </strong>What else? There’s a bunch of presentations.</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> Yeah so, I went through them all and looked at the possibilities. My number one prediction: We’re definitely going to see the gameplay debut of <em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</em>, and so notes here say, “Lights dim. Immediately shows a digitized re-creation of 9/11. No other details.”</p><p><strong>Riley:</strong> There’s a part of me that feels like you can’t put 9/11 in a video game.</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> I think they’re gonna do it!</p><p><strong>Riley: </strong>Because the rumors say that<em> Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</em> is gonna be about 9/11.</p><p><strong>Nathan: </strong>I think it’s gonna be like [infamous <em>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2</em> mission] “No Russian.” It’s experiential. You’re not gonna be doing 9/11, though that would be hilarious. The most audacious thing possible.</p><p><strong>Chris:</strong> We don’t have swings like that anymore. Even at the height of that shit, you couldn’t have pulled that off.</p><p><strong>Riley: </strong>I think, at least in America, it has a kind of cultural weight even still that… I think you just can’t.</p><p><strong>Chris: </strong>I agree. They’re gonna do something 9/11-ish. Maybe they will, maybe they won’t. I also think people just don’t have that dog in ‘em anymore. There was a real time in 2006, 2007, 2008 – or even the early teens – where you could really pull off some shit. It was about “Is that OK? Did that <em>offend </em>you?” Especially [<em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 2</em>], that was really bad. The <em>Dark Knight</em> guy [David S. Goyer] wrote that, if I remember correctly.&nbsp;</p><p>Nobody has that in them anymore. Even the last <em>Far Cry </em>game felt like they were just recycling the old <em>Far Cry </em>edgelord shit they used to be able to pull off.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> Oh yeah, <em>Far Cry</em> has not had the juice in three installments, at least.</p><p><strong>Chris:</strong> Since<em> Far Cry 2</em>. But they can’t even get to<em> Far Cry 3</em> again. They have to do, like, weird Cuban exile shit.&nbsp;</p><p>Here’s my prediction: Now, have I been playing through all of <em>Ninja Gaiden Sigma 2 </em>on Mentor [difficulty] to unlock a mod? Yes. Will I try to beat the game on Master Ninja? Yes. Does that influence what I’m about to predict? Of course not. But what I’m saying is, they’ll probably try to announce some kind of weird <em>Ninja Gaiden </em>reboot or something. In part because there was an anniversary video a few months ago, but also because it seems like the kind of shit that would happen.&nbsp;</p><p>That’s sort of Team Ninja’s deal now. <em>Stranger of Paradise </em>was somebody coming to them and going “Can you make <em>Nioh</em>, but for us?” And they were like “Sure.” I don’t doubt that Xbox would be like “Can we spend money on a weird [<em>Ninja Gaiden</em> reboot]? Bring this back home.” Because that has Xbox DNA in it. So that’s just me wish-casting that, because I think it would be funny, and it would line up with things that I’m doing right now. But other than that, I really don’t care.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Nathan: </strong>What do we think the over-under is on Geoff finally mentioning layoffs on stage? Because he did it on Twitter earlier this year.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Chris:</strong> I think he will.</p><p><strong>Riley:</strong> Zero percent. I wrote an article about this in our newsletter – about how many of the companies featured at Summer Game Fest had layoffs, which was, like, 40 percent. How is he gonna do it? Is he gonna be like “Massive layoffs at PlayStation, and now… PlayStation!”?</p><p><strong>Chris:</strong> No, what he’s gonna do is, he’s gonna do some annoying platitudes about how rough the industry is and how we’ve got to come together. “We are strong, we are gamers.” He’s gonna try to do gamer identity or games industry identity shit. He’s not going to in any way identify the cause of it, and by decoupling the cause from the results, he’s going to try to express empathy for the fact that everybody lost their jobs and get the cred for that while not spending any of the capital to insult the companies doing it.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Riley: </strong>He <a href="https://kotaku.com/geoff-keighley-opens-game-awards-with-disappointing-vag-1848190235" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">did that about the sexual assault stuff</a> a few years ago.</p><p><strong>Chris:</strong> That’s the playbook for MeToo or Black Lives Matter. Every time there’s something that happens, how far can you push it before you make somebody powerful mad?&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Nathan: </strong>Also, Geoff’s entire thing relies on powerful people. He has deals with a bunch of big companies. He’s friends with Kojima. That’s the whole appeal.</p><p>But also, yes, on one hand it would probably be in some way good for him to expend some social capital to talk about these issues more frankly. Gamers are often like “I just want to see my new product; I don’t care about the people who make it blah blah blah.” But on the other hand, it’s Geoff Keighley. After a certain point, it’s like asking Jake from State Farm to talk about Palestine. What do we really get from that? If you’re looking for meaningful, impactful work, I’m not sure if that’s the place to look.</p><p><strong>Chris:</strong> Right. That’s not going to make gamers suddenly give a shit about labor. And, you know, I want them to. That would be nice!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

  <p id="00PXky"><strong>Legendary Shards</strong> are disappearing in <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24124362/destiny-2-final-shape-subclass-reveal-prismatic"><em>Destiny 2: The Final Shape</em></a>. If you’re a veteran player, or have played <a href="https://www.polygon.com/destiny-2-witch-queen-guide/23392341/beginners-guide-starting-tips-lightfall-expansion"><em>Destiny 2</em></a> for any significant amount of time, you probably have a pretty big stockpile of Shards that you need to get rid of before June 3, which is when the servers go down to prepare for the new expansion.</p>
<p id="BBut1q">In this <em>Destiny 2</em> guide, I’ll help you figure out what to spend your Legendary Shards on before Bungie deletes them from your inventory.</p>
<hr id="2BLp3I">

<p id="68hK8t">If you’re like me, you have a lot of Legendary Shards to get rid of after seven years of hoarding. If you just wait until June 4, Bungie will delete them all for you, which is convenient. But if you want something more useful after all your time grinding, you can exchange them for a few different items in-game.</p>

<p id="c295Q3">Most players are taking their excess Legendary Shards and using them to purchase <strong>Phantasmal Fragments</strong> at the Lectern of Enchantment on the Moon for 10 Legendary Shards a piece. Rahool, the Cryptarch in the Tower, will allow you to exchange 10 Phantasmal Fragments for 10,000 Glimmer. While Bungie could take this exchange away, it’s better than nothing, and a solid way to turn your Legendary Shards into potential Glimmer.</p>
<p id="fHfMGC">If you’re a raider, another option is to buy<strong> Raid Banners</strong> from Hawthorn in the Tower. You can buy 10 Raid Banners for 30 Legendary Shards.</p>

<p id="MSOmkq">The best Legendary Shard exchange is, unfortunately, completely dependent on RNG. Rarely, Banshee-44 will sell a weapon with a <strong>Masterwork level of five</strong> (you have to buy each weapon to find its masterwork level). If you purchase a Masterwork five weapon over and over again, you’ll get an <strong>Enhancement Core</strong> out of each one that you dismantle. You can also do this if the Masterwork level is four, but the Enhancement Core won’t be guaranteed. </p>
<p id="KfRFOE">Enhancement Cores are very useful for upgrading gear, and getting them is a lot more difficult than restocking your Glimmer. Keep an eye on Banshee’s inventory over the weekend and see if you get lucky.</p>

<strong>What is replacing Legendary Shards in </strong><em><strong>Destiny 2</strong></em><strong>’s economy?</strong>
</h2>
<p id="QMyP4i">Legendary Shards have been the catch-all currency in <em>Destiny 2</em>, alongside <strong>Glimmer</strong>. With Shards going away, Glimmer is going to be the only general currency, and you’re just going to need to pair specialty currencies — like Ascendant Shards — with it to purchase the things you want. </p>
<p id="grYkOx">The catch there is that Glimmer has a cap of 500,000, so you can’t just stockpile it indefinitely like you could Legendary Shards. That’s why having Phantasmal Fragments or old Planetary Materials to exchange for Glimmer is so useful.</p>

What’s most surprising about <em>Selaco</em> isn’t that it’s developed in <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://zdoom.org/wiki/GZDoom&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://zdoom.org/wiki/GZDoom" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GZDoom</a></span>, but that it might be one of the best shooters I’ve played in years.<br></p><p><em>Selaco</em>, out now on Steam via early access, is a first-person shooter set inside the last surviving city containing all of human civilization. And unfortunately for the people living there, an alien invasion is happening and it’s up to you—a security guard—to help fight them back and save the day. Unlike <em>Doom </em>and similar shooters of that era, <em>Selaco </em>actually has quite a lot of lore and world-building to dig into via emails and terminals, if that’s something you care about. But if you’re just here to blast baddies with cool guns, <em>Selaco </em>has plenty of that, too.<br></p><h2 id="h270"><a id=""></a><strong>This ain’t your grandaddy’s boomer shooter</strong></h2><p>The gunplay in <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/games/selaco&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/games/selaco"><em>Selaco</em></a></span><em> </em>is fabulous, with weapons that are loud and powerful. Even the pistol, usually a trash firearm in old-school shooters, is a head-cracking magnum that you can upgrade into a fast-firing death machine. In fact, most of the guns in <em>Selaco </em>can be upgraded to improve their stats or unlock new features. This is done in upgradeable safe rooms you find dotted around the world…and yeah, you might be realizing this isn’t <em>Doom</em>.<br></p><p>That’s something I really want to stress. Don’t expect this to play like <em>Doom </em>or other contemporary shooters of the day. Instead, <em>Selaco</em> plays more like <em>Half-Life, Doom 3, </em>or <em>FEAR.</em> You’ll need to take cover, run away to get a better angle, ambush unsuspecting enemies for an advantage, and manage your ammo and health carefully to survive this FPS. If you go in with a shotgun and no plan, you’ll likely be dead in a few seconds. And as you progress through <em>Selaco </em>it turns up the challenge, forcing you to play carefully or die.</p><figure id="" data-id="2a9b562a7c82ae8323a9e11efa358373" data-recommend-id="image://2a9b562a7c82ae8323a9e11efa358373" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot shows a turret shooting an enemy in Selaco.

" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The big hook of <em>Selaco </em>for many will be the fact that, yes, it was developed using GZDoom—an open-source port of the original <em>Doom </em>engine that includes new features and tech not found in the ancient Id software game from the ‘90s. For the first few hours of <em>Selaco</em>, whenever I saw a massive level filled with individual items that I could pick up and toss around, I’d shake my head and think, “This is built on <em>Doom </em>tech. Wild!” But quickly, the novelty of that gimmick faded and was replaced by another thought: “This is a fucking awesome game.”</p><p><em>Selaco </em>is a more polished, well-made, and fun FPS than some AAA shooters I’ve played in recent years developed by massive teams using modern engines and big budgets. And this thing is technically in early access!</p><p>In fact, I bet as you play <em>Selaco </em>you’ll quickly forget all about its <em>Doom </em>origins as you run around its large, hand-crafted campaign maps filled with different enemies, puzzles, and loads of secrets. That may be the real secret of <em>Selaco</em>: While it’s cool and impressive that it was built using <em>Doom </em>tech, this<em> </em>is so much more than a retro throwback. It’s its own thing, and one of the best shooters in 2024. </p><p>&nbsp;.<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Take-Two Interactive appears set to get out of the indie business, and it’s closing studios to get there. According to a damning new report <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/take-two-is-quietly-killing-private-division" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">IGN’s Rebekah Valentine</a>, Take-Two Interactive is working on a plan to either sell off or shut down it’s indie label Private Division.</p>



<p>Valentine states that Take-Two, despite saying that it “didn’t shutter” <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/intercept-games-lay-offs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">it’s indie studios</a>, Kerbel Space Program developer Intercept Games will be closed on June 28. On a larger scale at Private Division, however, “almost all the staff” were let go at the end of April when it was said to them that Take-Two “would no longer support” the company.</p>



<p>The report adds that Take-Two has found a potential partner to buy Private Division in the form of an unknown private equity firm. </p>



<p>Valentine says that the sources she spoke to “expressed frustration at Take-Two leadership for alleged mismanagement of the label, and called out chief strategy officer and Private Division head Michael Worosz for poor leadership and mismanagement.”</p>



<p>On May 30, it was revealed that Private Division <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/private-division-terminates-publishing-deal-with-bloober-team-for-project-c/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">had terminated its agreement</a> with Bloober Team to publish Project C. With this new information being brought to light, it makes more sense as to why the agreement was canceled.</p>



<p>It was also in April when Take-Two <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gta-6-take-two-layoffs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced it was laying off</a> 5% of its global workforce, and canceling numerous games.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming has reached out to Take-Two for comment on the report. Should a response be received, it will be added to the story. For what it’s worth, the company declined to comment to IGN on the claims brought fourth and the status of Private Division.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24051853/in-a-violent-nature-review-horror-movie-slasher-villain<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="dRrzH7"><em>This review of </em>In a Violent Nature <em>was initially published to coincide with the movie’s premiere at the 2024 Sundance Film Festival. It has been updated for the film’s theatrical release.</em></p>
<h2 id="QtzSlx"><strong>Logline</strong></h2>
<p id="0HWcwP"><em>In a Violent Nature</em> follows Johnny, a hulking creature who has been dead for years, as he seeks vengeance on the most recent group of teens to bring him back to life. </p>
<h2 id="qQJ92i"><strong>Longerline</strong></h2>
<p id="b8GcFu">The way<em> In a Violent Nature</em> reveals its plot is a huge part of the fun of the movie, so no spoilers here. Instead, it’s worth talking a little bit about the vibe of the movie, which is mostly pastoral, rather than bombastic and quick. Writer-director Chris Nash seems to take inspiration from Michael Myers’ slow but deliberate stalking in <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23333343/best-halloween-movies-series-watch-michael-myers-john-carpenter">the Halloween movie series</a>. Long stretches of <em>In a Violent Nature</em> are still, quiet, gorgeous shots of nature — sometimes with a killer lumbering through them, sometimes not. </p>
<p id="BQQenY">This beautiful photography is a huge bonus to the movie, considering that most of the run time is devoted to Johnny walking from one place to another, in determined pursuit of his victims. Following a slasher-movie villain — part Jason Voorhees, part Michael Myers — mostly means watching him walking around, which seems perfectly intuitive when you see it on screen. <em>In a Violent Nature</em> makes these traveling scenes feel vibrant, purposeful, and intense, rather than like the drag they could have easily been.</p>
<p id="102m6V">Of course, this wouldn’t be a slasher if there wasn’t some slashing, and<em> In a Violent Nature</em> has plenty of that, too. The movie is full of gruesome kills, but Nash mixes the specifics up enough (from beheading to drowning to axe-throwing) that you never quite know what’s coming next, so the action never gets stale. </p>

<h2 id="PdCpiD"><strong>What’s In a Violent Nature trying to do?</strong></h2>
<p id="9bQGiy">It’s hard to describe this movie better than its press release does: It’s been labeled as an “ambient slasher.” It’s a slow, methodical movie, with sparse dialogue and not much character development. But that still doesn’t really describe what <em>In a Violent Nature</em> is going for. It feels more like a nature documentary approach to horror, with a slasher villain as a true animal kingdom predator, stalking through a beautiful forest and watching his prey from the foliage.</p>
<h2 id="5eDPYk"><strong>Does In a Violent Nature live up to its premise? </strong></h2>
<p id="otVa9M">Yes, but it might not be able to quite transcend that premise. <em>In a Violent Nature</em>’s endless forward locomotion and our slasher monster’s unflappable determination keep things interesting, and the tight 94-minute run time makes sure the story isn’t dull. But without the visceral release of tension in jump scares or surprise murder, the film feels like a constant build that never actually fully pays off. There’s no grand ending to cap off the story, which may be fitting for seeing the monster’s side of the story, but isn’t quite satisfying for an audience. Even so, the craft and uniqueness of <em>In a Violent Nature</em> make it well worth a watch.</p>
<h2 id="zX9jQI"><strong>The quote that says it all</strong></h2>
<p id="1HNraQ">This isn’t exactly a single quote, but watching Johnny lurk just outside the light of his teenage victims’ campfire while one of them tells his friends (and the audience) Johnny’s creepy origin story is an outstanding moment that casually reframes nearly every slasher ever made. We all know Jason had to be lurking just past the treeline during various scenes in the Friday the 13th franchise, but what exactly did he overhear while he was stalking his victims? </p>
<h2 id="DcLbG8"><strong>Most memeable moment</strong></h2>
<p id="lhbpmy">It’s hard to imagine finding a meme anywhere in a movie paced this slowly, but Johnny’s cold, dead, monstrous hands clasping around a necklace that says “#1 Motherfucker” is at least pretty funny.</p>
<h2 id="qxrgBT"><strong>Is In a Violent Nature good?</strong></h2>
<p id="oJXGkm"><em>In a Violent Nature</em> is good, it’s just good in a different way than you might expect from its premise. It won’t exactly fill the trashy slasher hole in your heart, and it definitely isn’t for the “Friday night at the movies” crowd that most slashers are aimed at.</p>
<p id="bfdODm">But for horror fans, it’s a rare treat and a fantastic exercise in taking a genre in the opposite direction that everyone else has tried.<em> In a Violent Nature</em> may not spawn a franchise of Johnny resurrections, but there’s a good chance that every slasher that comes after it will take small bits of influence from the things<em> In a Violent Nature</em> does well. </p>
<h2 id="LpCOH8"><strong>When can we see it?</strong></h2>
<p id="66w5De"><em>In a Violent Nature</em> is in theaters now, and will stream on Shudder later this year. </p>

<p id="oYswHw">Like all tech, the Steam Deck houses many fragile components. But the one that’s most prone to accidental damage is its 7-inch (or 7.4-inch, if you have a Steam Deck OLED) glass-covered display. I highly recommend that every Deck owner buys a set of <a href="https://www.amazon.com/amFilm-Screen-Protector-Compatible-Steam/dp/B09TPF6NQ8/?tag=polygon05-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank" has-subtag="true" data-cdata="{&quot;rewritten_url&quot;:&quot;https://www.amazon.com/amFilm-Screen-Protector-Compatible-Steam/dp/B09TPF6NQ8/?ascsubtag=___pl__p_23392002__m_m-placeholder__s_s-placeholder__t_w__c_c-placeholder__r_r-placeholder__d_d-placeholder\u0026tag=polygon05-20&quot;,&quot;subtag_max_length&quot;:99,&quot;subtag_delim_length&quot;:3,&quot;subtag_key&quot;:&quot;ascsubtag&quot;,&quot;subtag_data&quot;:{&quot;ascsubtag&quot;:&quot;___pl__p_23392002__m_m-placeholder__s_s-placeholder__t_w__c_c-placeholder__r_r-placeholder__d_d-placeholder&quot;,&quot;tag&quot;:&quot;polygon05-20&quot;},&quot;encode_subtag&quot;:false}">tempered glass screen protectors</a> (I’ve had nothing but good experiences from amFilm, although there are many players in this space). It may not save your Deck from catastrophic damage, but its job is to absorb scrapes and jabs instead of the actual glass covering your display (<a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=66960X1516586&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ifixit.com%2Fproducts%2Fsteam-deck-64gb-or-256gb-screen&amp;referrer=polygon.com&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.polygon.com%2Fwhat-to-buy%2F23627961%2Fbest-steam-deck-accessories" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank" has-subtag="true" data-cdata="{&quot;rewritten_url&quot;:&quot;https://go.redirectingat.com?xcust=___pl__p_23392002__m_m-placeholder__s_s-placeholder__t_w__c_c-placeholder__r_r-placeholder__d_d-placeholder\u0026id=66960X1516586\u0026xs=1\u0026url=https://www.ifixit.com/products/steam-deck-64gb-or-256gb-screen\u0026referrer=polygon.com\u0026sref=https://www.polygon.com/what-to-buy/23627961/best-steam-deck-accessories&quot;,&quot;subtag_max_length&quot;:50,&quot;subtag_delim_length&quot;:3,&quot;subtag_key&quot;:&quot;xcust&quot;,&quot;subtag_data&quot;:{&quot;xcust&quot;:&quot;___pl__p_23392002__m_m-placeholder__s_s-placeholder__t_w__c_c-placeholder__r_r-placeholder__d_d-placeholder&quot;,&quot;id&quot;:&quot;66960X1516586&quot;,&quot;xs&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.ifixit.com/products/steam-deck-64gb-or-256gb-screen&quot;,&quot;referrer&quot;:&quot;polygon.com&quot;,&quot;sref&quot;:&quot;https://www.polygon.com/what-to-buy/23627961/best-steam-deck-accessories&quot;},&quot;encode_subtag&quot;:false}">screen replacements</a> aren’t exactly cheap). When the cover eventually gets scratches, or cracks, simply remove it and apply a new one. </p>
<p id="NT7XvN"><strong>Note</strong>: While the Steam Deck OLED’s screen is bigger than the original Steam Deck, the size of the glass covering the display on both models is identical, so these screen protectors are great for whichever Steam Deck you buy.</p>

<p id="Fr7s2k">The Steam Deck comes with up to 512 GB of SSD storage if you buy the $449 LCD model (or the $549 OLED model). Although, for being Valve’s higher-end models, that’s not a abundance of storage, given that PC games routinely come in 30-60 GB install sizes. For those who buy the $349 model, there’s even less onboard storage to work with: just 64 GB. Whichever model you have, buying a microSD card for extra game space is pretty much essential. You might be able to put it off for now, but likely not for long.</p>

<p id="0JALoS">Many people jibe with the feel of Valve’s thumbsticks on the Steam Deck. But if you dislike how slippery they can be, simply pop some of these affordable grips from Skull &amp; Co. on top of your Deck’s sticks.

Keep in mind, however, that they may prevent the Deck’s capacitive thumbstick feature from working as intended.</p>

<p id="JvVdpZ">If you envision going into the Steam Deck’s desktop mode, you may want to grab a compact wireless keyboard to type on. Without it, it’s a real pain to touch type and navigate on the Deck’s screen (especially if you have big fingers). So, do yourself a favor and buy this all-in-one, foldable keyboard that has a trackpad built in.

<p id="mJOxOy">While Valve wasn’t the first company to launch a Deck-compatible dock, its version is one of the most port-rich options. Its Deck Dock has HDMI 2.0, DisplayPort 1.4, a USB-C port to receive power from a wall adapter (it includes the same 45 W model that the Steam Deck ships with), a gigabit Ethernet port, and three USB-A 3.1 ports. The inclusion of DisplayPort sets it apart from most USB-C hubs, along with its elegant design. But it comes at a pricier cost than most third-party alternatives, priced at <a href="https://www.steamdeck.com/en/dock">$79</a>.</p>

<p id="NVUl4f">Jsaux makes a very similar option to Valve’s official Deck Dock, albeit with a less catchy name. It’s called the HB0702, and it costs $59.99. Like the Deck Dock, it has USB-C for power, DisplayPort 1.2, HDMI 2.0, three USB-A 3.2 ports, and gigabit Ethernet support. Get this one if you don’t care whether you have the official Deck Dock, but want nearly identical features.</p>

It includes more than you may need, like a kickstand (shown above), accessory mounts, and more. But crucially, it includes screws that don’t come in the a-la-carte wall or monitor mounting bundles.

<p id="KmEfId">The wall mount is self-explanatory; it’s a mount that you can secure to your wall by two screws, or just by its strong 3M VHB adhesive. Then the Deckmate’s grip lets it snap onto the wall. As for the monitor mount, you’re getting a mount that can be screwed into any VESA-compliant stand. Then you just snap the Deck onto it.</p>

<p id="bKk6So">If you want a controller to use with your Steam Deck, whether it’s docked or on a stand, you have multiple options. The Deck supports most controllers that connect Bluetooth or via USB. This includes controllers you may already have laying around if you own consoles, like those that control the Xbox Series X, PS5, or Nintendo Switch, and more. </p>
<p id="HKhwaa">You should proceed to the next section if you’re happy with the controllers you own. But, if you’re in the market for a unique gamepad that has the Xbox analog stick layout, Hall effect joysticks that won’t degrade over time compared to standard analog sticks, plus native wireless support with the Nintendo Switch, your best bet is the 8BitDo Ultimate Wireless.</p>

<p id="qd7Aib">There are a bunch of soft and hard cases out there that you can slip your Steam Deck into to ruggedize it, and any of those might be just fine for you. But we’ve really enjoyed the Dbrand Project Killswitch, which lets you add or remove a kickstand, in addition to doing a great job of protecting your console and adding some grip.</p>
<p id="8RoiZb">Like most options, the Killswitch leaves easy access to all of its buttons, triggers, ports, and most importantly, its fan’s airflow. But it’s great that you can add or remove the included kickstand with its lock slot.

<p id="R7Ufbz">It’s a shame that Valve doesn’t offer its <a href="https://www.polygon.com/gaming/23950949/steam-deck-oled-new-case-review-valve">improved case</a> bundled exclusively with the Steam Deck OLED 1 TB edition for general sale. It gives you the option of a thick, tough case Deck owners are used to, but its special trick lies in its ability to transform into a slimmer case when you pull away its Velcro-locked inner layer. Until that becomes widely available, anyone who’s looking for a case replacement should check out Spigen’s Rugged Armor Pro, a semi-hard case with a pocket. Additionally, it secures the Deck inside with a strap, and if you’re worried about losing your console, there’s enough room in its pocket for a <a href="https://www.polygon.com/what-to-buy/23707943/best-bluetooth-tracker-item-finder-apple-airtag-tile">Bluetooth tracker</a>, like an Apple AirTag. This models seems to be out of stock currently, so we’re investigating replacement options.</p>

<p data-characters="187" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">A few years back, someone spread the word that FromSoftware was making a Kart game set in the world of <em>Bloodborne</em>. It was but an April Fools’ joke, but it soon blossomed into much more.</p> <p data-characters="134" data-current-count="134" data-injectable="false">Over two years of development and a <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/after-warning-from-sony-bloodborne-kart-is-dropping-references-to-the-brand/">few months of legal tinkering</a> later, developer Lilith Walther has finally released <em>Nightmare Kart</em>.</p> <figure data-current-count="434" data-injectable="true"><div> <blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Nightmare Kart:🏁OUT NOW FOR FREE🏁</p><p>🏎️Zoom through gothic city streets in this combat kart racer!</p><p>💉Full campaign mode complete w boss fights!<br>🕵️21 Racers!<br>🏍️13 Karts!<br>🏁15 Tracks!<br>⚔️Split Screen Multiplayer!</p><p>🩸LETS CLEANSE THESE FOUL STREETS🩸</p><p>⬇️DOWNLOAD LINKS IN REPLIES⬇️ <a href="https://t.co/fbScnmrhFG">pic.twitter.com/fbScnmrhFG</a></p></div>— 🪄✨ PSX Bunlith (NIGHTMARE KART OUT NOW!!!) (@b0tster) <a href="https://twitter.com/b0tster/status/1796557254281638255?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 31, 2024</a></blockquote> </div></figure>
 <p data-characters="467" data-current-count="467" data-injectable="true">You might know Lilith from <em><a href="https://b0tster.itch.io/bbpsx">Bloodborne PSX</a></em>, a remake of the first sections of the PS4 classic that played and looked just like a PS1 game. It was great, but <em>Nightmare Kart</em> is on a whole different level. You can pick between 21 racers, 13 karts, 15 tracks, and none of it is a mere transplant from <em>Bloodborne</em>. While each character is heavily inspired by a <em>Bloodborne</em> counterpart, these are all complemented by original additions coming straight out of Lilith’s mind. </p>
 <p data-characters="656" data-current-count="656" data-injectable="true">Most vehicles are original and unique, some of them to the point of absurdity. For example, Herman doesn’t even need a Kart or a Bike. The <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/all-bloodborne-mandatory-boss-fights-in-order/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">old man remains so strong</a> that he needs nothing more than his his ultra-powerful arms to move his wheelchair as quickly as everyone else moves their motorized vehicle. Nicolas is mad, but no one even dares coming close enough to tell him about the rules, so he ditches any sort of vehicle and just runs alongside the others. Those are just a few of the quirks I’ve been able to notice in the short period of time I’ve had to try the game so far, so I’m sure there are so many more for you to find.</p>
 <p data-characters="357" data-current-count="357" data-injectable="false">On top of allowing you to challenge your friends to races in split-screen mode, there’s also a battle mode where you can just duke it out against a bunch of friends or AI opponents in a bunch of very familiar arenas. <em>Nightmare Kart</em> not only looks like a game of old, it also features many of the <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/the-best-split-screen-games-of-all-time/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">multiplayer options</a> that we miss in the games of today.</p> <p data-characters="262" data-current-count="619" data-injectable="true">There are also a bunch of very welcome customization options, such as the CRT FX, which does a great job of filtering the pixelation like the TVs of old did. Also, this might be the closest non-modders will ever get to playing something <em>Bloodborne</em>-ish at 60 FPS:</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"></figure> <p data-characters="143" data-current-count="443" data-injectable="true">The most positively surprising element for me, however, was the presence of an actual campaign, one with cutscenes and even unique boss fights.</p>
 <p data-characters="335" data-current-count="335" data-injectable="false">In a world where games can’t seem to stop becoming more expensive, getting such a package completely free of charge feels almost like a miracle. Yes, you can get <em>Nightmare Kart</em> right now for free on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2930160/Nightmare_Kart/">Steam</a> or pay-what-you-want on <a href="https://b0tster.itch.io/nmkart">itch.io</a>. You can also get <em>Nightmare Kart</em>’s fantastic original soundtrack from Bandcamp <a href="https://thenobledemon.bandcamp.com/album/nightmare-kart-original-soundtrack">right here</a>.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/centum-is-a-strange-mystifying-dive-into-a-very-haunted-computer.886788/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/centum-is-a-strange-mystifying-dive-into-a-very-haunted-computer/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=centum-is-a-strange-mystifying-dive-into-a-very-haunted-computer<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="351" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">I’ve been struggling to determine how, exactly, I want to talk about <em>Centum</em>. Not in terms of basic stuff, like genre or developer or “it plays like X meets Y.” Those are fairly easy to tack down. No, it’s the next layer down that has had me thinking a lot about <em>Centum </em>since I hit the end of its preview build: the how and why.</p> <p data-characters="566" data-current-count="566" data-injectable="true">So let’s start with the easy parts. <em>Centum </em>is a narrative adventure, largely falling within the point-and-click genre, from developer Hack The Publisher and publisher Serenity Forge. Most of its gameplay consists of interacting with objects, selecting dialogue choices, and unlocking new interactions through flowchart-like experimentation. Move an object, find a new thing to put in your inventory, test it out on all the other interactable spots on-screen. If you’ve ever journeyed with Guybrush Threepwood or Putt-Putt, these parts will feel familiar.</p>
 <p data-characters="256" data-current-count="256" data-injectable="false">Where it starts to feel less familiar is all the mini-games. Or the sudden art style switches. Or maybe even with the creepy ghost kid who seems helpful, for now. This is where <em>Centum </em>starts to make it clear that it’s not just another adventure game.</p> <figure data-current-count="556" data-injectable="true"><p> <iframe title="Centum Official Announcement Trailer" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/aR86sG-uKc4?feature=oembed&amp;enablejsapi=1&amp;origin=https://www.destructoid.com" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure>
 <p data-characters="560" data-current-count="560" data-injectable="true">Even before you’re in the swing of pointing and clicking, <em>Centum </em>starts you out in a computer interface. It’s an old-school, chunky interface that reminded me of the colorful iMacs we used to use in school. I will never be able to resist a good fake desktop; poring over files and folders is a guilty pleasure, and much like <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-telling-lies/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Telling Lies</a> </em>or <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/cibele-is-a-game-about-love-sex-and-the-internet/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cibele</a></em>,<em> Centum </em>leans into that. Although rather than deriving some gratification from digging through personal details, it builds a lot of terror over discovering what exactly a file or folder might contain.</p>
 <p data-characters="294" data-current-count="294" data-injectable="false">Let me put it a different way: <em>Centum </em>imagines that you are interacting with this computer. But what does it mean that <em>you</em>, the player, are interacting with it? What is this computer, exactly? Where, when, and why does it exist? And what happened to the people that used this interface before? </p> <figure data-current-count="594" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Hack The Publisher</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="349" data-current-count="349" data-injectable="false">As you read over notepad clues and hints towards your situation, it becomes a little creepier. Names start to drop, and you only have vague understandings of their importance. Also, can a machine be haunted? This one sure feels haunted. If ghosts could plague the living, what spirits can manifest in the binary ones-and-zeroes of <em>Centum</em>‘s PC?</p> <p data-characters="483" data-current-count="832" data-injectable="true">These are the thoughts I had running through my mind as I clicked and prodded my way through <em>Centum</em>‘s first two chapters. Both are closed-room puzzles, where the player needs to discern a way out, while also running up against several different roadblocks. In the first chapter, for instance, you’re trapped in a cell. A Judge berates you, asking why you’re here, what you did, and who you are. It reprimands you when you answer incorrectly, and I was always wrong.</p>
 <p data-characters="363" data-current-count="363" data-injectable="false">Again, these moments feel a bit familiar: a locked room, filled with philosophical and psychological quandaries surrounding how you’ll get out. Hack The Publisher even has a little minigame that’s similar to the Giant’s Game from <em>Ender’s Game</em>, eye-gouging and all, that feels like a little nod towards players that notice the similarities.</p> <p data-characters="666" data-current-count="1029" data-injectable="true">The ways to get out are similarly gnarly and surreal. I talked to a wall, grew a tree, and observed the city. A small box played music. And at one point, I trapped a demon with mirrors. I don’t want to get too deep into the “how” of it all, as that’s a big appeal of <em>Centum</em>‘s in-the-moment puzzle-solving, though I also think it’s where <em>Centum </em>struggled a bit for me. Some solutions, like the aforementioned mirrors, felt a bit unclear at times. And you’ll need a good tolerance for picking up objects and testing them on various other items; some were a bit straightforward to figure out, while others were head-scratchers.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Hack The Publisher</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="334" data-current-count="634" data-injectable="true">The mini-games are also a little hit-or-miss. I enjoyed them in a few cases, and there’s an element of simplicity and tedium that feels textually important. It did mean, though, that when I accidentally restarted one of the games, being locked back into beating it was a bit frustrating. Not a major gripe, just a small wrinkle.</p>
 <p data-characters="409" data-current-count="409" data-injectable="true">What really, <em>really </em>works for <em>Centum </em>is its art style. Really, it’s a multitude of art styles. At some points, it looks like a point-and-click classic. Then, it will introduce a creepy apparition. Then, it might peel off into a seemingly hand-drawn, winding line art of white-on-black. These segues can feel sudden and jarring in a really good way. And man, the cat-phone. I am haunted by the cat-phone.</p>
 <p data-characters="359" data-current-count="359" data-injectable="false">By the end of the preview, I felt I was starting to grasp what <em>Centum </em>is about, and the story it’s trying to tell. It’s an incredibly fascinating one. I think if you like the general gist of exploring artificial intelligence, man-made horrors, and maybe a heaping helping of both guilt and family drama, you’ll dig what <em>Centum </em>is concocting.</p> <figure data-current-count="659" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Hack The Publisher</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="279" data-current-count="279" data-injectable="false">Really, <em>Centum </em>feels like a reminder of what this year is turning out to be. The usual wave of AAA releases has slowed to a trickle, and indie studios are finding a lot of room to appeal to niche interests, to eschew broad appeals in favor of making something a bit more unique. </p> <p data-characters="368" data-current-count="647" data-injectable="true">That is <em>Centum</em>, to me. It might not be for <em>everyone</em>. But the fact that it isn’t makes it all the more appealing to me. I dig its thoughts about ghosts in the machine. I vibe with its art style. Maybe I do like cat-phone, after all. But I do think, if any of this made you sit up a bit in your seat and go “hm,” then <em>Centum </em>is worth keeping an eye on.</p>
 <p data-characters="76" data-current-count="76" data-injectable="false"><em>Centum </em>is currently planned for Xbox Series X|S and PC sometime this summer.</p>

The <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/heroscape-returns-to-retail-by-renegade-game-studios">recently revived</a> board game has received new updates and expansions before, including the recent <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/heroquest-rise-of-dread-moon-breathes-new-life-into-30-year-old-game"><em>Rise of the Dread Moon</em></a>. This new expansion, HeroQuest Jungles of Dethrak continues that active support.</p>

<h2>The HeroQuest Jungles of Dethrak Pre-order announcement</h2>

<p>According to an official press release, <em>HeroQuest Jungles of Dethrak</em> brings players into the dense jungle surrounding the mountains at World's Edge. In this jungle, an ancient dwarven civilization has found new roots. But a sacred artifact held in Kellar's Keep, prized by the dwarven refugees, has been stolen.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/heroquest-jungles-of-dethrak-box-set-up.jpg?itok=Y59qGFPc 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/heroquest-jungles-of-dethrak-box-set-up.jpg?itok=vtPIYMmw 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Ready to jump back in?</figcaption></figure><p>Because of this, a blight has infected the jungle to its roots. As a powerful Berserker or Explorer hero, players will traverse the jungles and discover the vile secrets within. But all may be lost if the truth behind this land and its past are not uncovered.</p>

<p><em>HeroQuest Jungles of Dethrak</em> expansion will contain 16 new quests. Those quests will include a new choose-your-own-adventure mechanic where players can choose different paths leading to different endings. While other co-op board games have branching narratives based on player choice, this is a first for <em>HeroQuest</em>.</p>

<p>The expansion contains 36 illustrated cards, 29 detailed unpainted miniatures, and 29 double-sided cardboard pieces.</p>

<p><em>HeroQuest Jungles of Dethrak</em> is the second major quest pack to release for this new era of the board game. After being discontinued in 2010 and a brief fan reprint in 2021, the <em>HeroQuest</em> line was brought back to retail thanks to a licensing deal with Hasbro. That licensing deal included the production of new expansions as well as organized play support.</p>

<p>HeroQuest Jungles of Dethrak will be available for pre-order August 1 on Amazon and fan retailers. It will be sold at an MSRP of $44.99. You will need a copy of the HeroQuest main game to use this new expansion.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/anger-foots-twisted-world-is-frenetic-wild-ride</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/anger-foots-twisted-world-is-a-frenetic-wild-ride.886770/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/anger-foots-twisted-world-is-frenetic-wild-ride<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>With a name like <em>Anger Foot</em>, that's a game that wears its heart on its sleeve. This is one wacky game all about kicking baddies through the mean streets of Shit City. You're on a quest to steal back your beloved shoe collection, and you'll stop at nothing to get those precious kickers back.</p>

<p>It's really hard not to be goofy about <em>Anger Foot</em>, because the premise is so fun, even if it's a bit simplistic. After all, you're just kicking your way through droves of goons, and maybe you'll pick up a few guns along the way. There's definitely a game underneath all this goofiness, though, and it seems to have improved since my <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/anger-foot-is-hotline-miami-for-foot-fetishists">last foray</a> into the madness.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/anger-foot-story-1.jpg?itok=klFVGiR4 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/anger-foot-story-1.jpg?itok=otXDKfvD 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Crime is law, and law is crime!</figcaption></figure><h2>The Mean Streets of <em>Anger Foot'</em>s... WHAT City?</h2>

<p>Developer <a href="https://techraptor.net/companies/free-lives">Free Lives</a>' efforts have not gone unnoticed in polishing up this title. If you managed to play <em>Anger Foot </em>at PAX or during a Steam Next Fest, you'll know there was a solid foundation for a game. In this new build, however, the look of <em>Anger Foot</em> has improved a great deal, level designs are expanded, and it also adds new (and outrageously weird) story segments.</p>

<p>In terms of graphics, the lighting Free Lives added to <em>Anger Foot</em> did wonders to the overall aesthetic of the game. You're in this dank, dirty city full of violence and chaos, so it's fitting that the game takes a bit of a darker look. The shaders don't clash with the brighter, cartoonish style and create a very playful aesthetic.</p>

<p>Levels, on the other hand, appear more detailed with clutter and objects that go flying when you unleash your hellish kick on enemies. Enemies, trash, beer bottles, barrels, and doors go flying at every kick and makes for some chaotic and lighthearted action.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/anger-foot-dialog.jpg?itok=JYFNeiQ- 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/anger-foot-dialog.jpg?itok=EOvy3e09 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>This kid's Mom won't be happy when she hears he's been watching TELEVISION!</figcaption></figure><p>Level layouts I remember from my previous sessions with <em>Anger Foot</em> seem a bit longer and more intricate. There are more side paths or rooms added this time around, giving off the feeling of a more finished product.</p>

<p>As for the world itself, we see it get fleshed out in more story segments -- these occur every few levels. Our hellbent hero can walk through the streets and apartments and interact with Shit City's various denizens -- and no, I'm not making that name up. It's really called Shit City.</p>

<p>The crude humor of <em>Anger Foot</em> isn't going to appeal to everyone, but it can be quite comical at times. Crime is normal in Shit City, you see, so laws are non-existent. This flips society on its head, and instead of being shamed for littering, you have whole gangs dedicated to polluting the city.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/anger-foot-story-2.jpg?itok=ysNEyEIS 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/anger-foot-story-2.jpg?itok=RD359WPU 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>I'm sure this is totally safe and sanitary.</figcaption></figure><p>There are other groups, too, like the Violence Gang, lead by Goo Cop. At one point during a story segment, I learned that initiation into the Violence Gang required one to be shanked. But you know, that's one of the more <em>normal</em> interactions amongst this city's people.</p>

<p>Heck, have you ever seen a masked-up thug hold a dolphin at gunpoint? Man, in Shit City, instead of ridding the city's water source of microplastics, we have hooligans making <em>macroplastics</em>. There are some real out-of-pocket moments that'll likely get a chuckle or two out of you, and honestly, I can't wait to learn more about the other gangs in <em>Anger Foot</em>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/anger-foot-gameplay-2.jpg?itok=7gZWkiAi 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/anger-foot-gameplay-2.jpg?itok=AXUriARo 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>I wonder if he skipped leg day?</figcaption></figure><h2><em>Anger Foot -- </em>it's Faster, Better, and Harder</h2>

<p>If you aren't weird like me, then you'll probably care more about the gameplay than whatever the hell is going on in Shit City. Fair, and you may be happy to know you can skip story segments if you so choose. If you're here for gameplay, <em>Anger Foot</em> retains that same <em>Hotline Miami-</em>inspired, balls-to-the-wall, one-hit-kill philosophy.</p>

<p>You've got a foot that can kick, and a hand that can hold guns. You can kick bad guys and take their guns, shoot when you need to, and kick when all else fails. Knocking down doors as fast as you can while rushing to the finish is the name of the game.</p>

<p>I like the gameplay, for the most part. It's simple, but with the physics and chaos at every level (as well as some better level design), we have a fast-paced, solid experience. The difficulty this time around feels a bit more punishing than last time, which is a shame since<em> </em>my last sessions with<em> </em><em>Anger Foot</em> felt juuust right.</p>

Gameplay is timed and with challenges for every level, you're incentivized to get to the exit as fast as possible. This is where the gameplay felt at odds with itself.</p>

<p>Because you're incentivized to go fast, you want to rush through levels. Enemies, however, are often placed in blind spots or have aim rivaling that of a Navy SEAL sniper, meaning you're going to die a lot. Oftentimes, it just feels unfair. If you don't beeline for the thugs with the guns right away, you're going to restart almost immediately.</p>

<p>The aim felt just a little <em>too</em> good on these guys, so you can avoid shots by hiding behind a wall or going slower -- but why <em>would</em> you want to go slower when <em>Anger Foot</em> urges the player to rush? The difficulty just felt off, and that feeling of rushing was exacerbated by challenges that seemed impossible to complete with how many thugs with guns you'd happen across.</p>

I love the <a>outrageous</a>, silly world Free Lives is developing and its universe has the potential to expand across multiple games. I have no doubt the rest of <em>Anger Foot</em> is equally stellar, but the current difficulty might just be a little too much for me.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ea-sports-college-football-25%E2%80%99s-unique-features-make-it-look-like-way-more-than-a-madden-reskin.886767/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24168832/ea-sports-college-football-25-new-features-like-madden<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="7XzBDG">Summer is only just starting, but <a href="https://www.polygon.com/gaming/24159066/ea-sports-college-football-trailer-analysis">college football fans are already itching to head back to campus</a> in <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24158944/college-football-25-trailer-gameplay-modes"><em>EA Sports College Football 25</em></a>. The upcoming game marks the franchise’s return after <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24157717/college-football-25-release-date-ps5-xbox-series-x-ea-sports">over 10 years of absence</a>, and will be the first game in the series to feature officially licensed player likenesses, thanks to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/5525588/2024/05/29/ea-sports-college-football-25-video-games-nil/">NIL money and a large-scale campaign to pay players to appear in the game</a>. On Friday, EA released a massive deep-dive into the game’s ridiculous number of new features, and the ways it aims to create the most realistic college football experience ever, both on and off the field. </p>
<p id="9rL168">With real players in the game for the first time, many of <em>College Football 25</em>’s new features put an emphasis on making it clear what separates the best players in the sport from everyone else. The game includes a variety of players traits that will augment gameplay, like responding better to high pressure situations and being able to identify on-coming blitzers. There will be more than 80 of these traits in the game at launch, as well as different tiers for each one. </p>
<p id="WtcgpY">The game will also feature an extensive new injury system called Wear and Tear, which shows the specific injury effects of each play, and how much it increases a player’s risk of injury. While this is important during games, it’s even more important in modes like Dynasty, where you run an entire college football program and have to look after your players from game to game. </p>
<div id="5C5ugz"><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Kf86x8F9M90?rel=0" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share;"></iframe></p></div>
<p id="WRwJy2">One of the ways the game appears to be a major departure from the Madden franchise is also true of college football versus the NFL: There’s way more variety in playbooks. <em>College Football 25</em> already seems pretty dedicated to preserving the individuality and quirks of the 134 schools in the game. There’s a detailed option system in the game, including a Flexbone formation with Air Force’s signature triple option. There’s a new feature which lets players pull the ball back and run with it in the middle of a called reverse, and EA even highlights a wide formation, a staple for Oklahoma. </p>
<p id="Bm9dk7">EA also takes time to note how important real-life tradition is to the presentation of games in <em>College Football 25</em>. Every stadium and fan base in college football has their own unique rituals, and EA has tried to capture as many of those as they can for the game, licensing certain songs for team walkout music (<a href="https://www.sportingnews.com/us/ncaa-football/news/ea-college-football-25-enter-sandman-jump-around-iconic-songs/73f0857036908ba007de66e9">though not every song could be secured</a>), and including fan traditions like Tennessee’s checkered stadium and Penn State’s “White Out”. All of this is in service of not just recreating the authentic highs of a college home game, but also to enhance the game’s new emphasis on home field advantage, with the ridiculously loud stadiums making it harder for the away team to concentrate on things like calling hot routes.</p>
<p id="qcPNwf">These are just a few of the new features EA Sports announced for the game on Friday. To get a look at more of the features, EA has put together a short gameplay video narrated by sportscaster Kirk Herbstreit, as well as a <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/ea-sports-college-football/college-football-25/news/college-football-25-gameplay-deep-dive">very in-depth blog post</a> that outlines each of the game’s new systems in great detail. </p>
<p id="WDcFqN"><em>EA Sports College Football 25</em> is set for release on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X on July 19.</p>

You instead decided to mix 2D <a title="Companies > sprite [19 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/sprite">sprite</a>s with perspective-shifting 3D environments. Why?</strong></p><p><strong>Tokuro Fujiwara:</strong> “<em>Tomba!</em> runs on 3D technology, with gameplay designed around 2D principles. This is why it’s described as a 2.5D game. I think 2D games have a certain kind of charm that 3D doesn’t. I also wanted to push the limits of what could be done. To bring my vision to life, I needed to use 2D principles along with 3D CG visuals. This allowed me to create something that felt new on the <a title="Platforms > PlayStation [45,155 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation">PlayStation</a>.</p><p>“There were times when I wondered if I should go 3D instead, 3D games have a very clear sense of space. In 2D, all the <a title="Genres > Action [1,867 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/action">action</a> takes place on a flat plane, and multiple layers provide a sense of depth. This means you have to design the game in creative ways so that the different layers don’t conflict. This results in something interesting that can only be achieved with 2D.”</p><p><!--[if lt IE 9]><script>document.createElement('video');</script><![endif]--><br><video id="video-886605-1" width="640" height="360" preload="metadata" controls="controls"><source type="video/mp4" src="https://blog.playstation.com/uploads/2024/05/aa2081e8a386661ff55fea65514a3e36377fea40.mp4?_=1"><a href="https://blog.playstation.com/uploads/2024/05/aa2081e8a386661ff55fea65514a3e36377fea40.mp4">https://blog.playstation.com/uploads/2024/05/aa2081e8a386661ff55fea65514a3e36377fea40.mp4</a></video></p><p><strong>What do you hope new players will take away from <em>Tomba! Special Edition</em>?</strong></p><p><strong>Fujiwara:</strong> “<em>Tomba!</em> has many side quests. These come in different varieties and are hidden throughout the game. I encourage players to seek them out. Various items allow players to learn new moves, expanding how levels can be beaten. I hope players search and seal away the Evil Pigs scattered throughout the world, which will unlock even more to see! There are many discoveries to be made. I hope players can relax and enjoy the world of <em>Tomba!</em>”</p><p><video id="video-886605-2" width="640" height="360" preload="metadata" controls="controls"><source type="video/mp4" src="https://blog.playstation.com/uploads/2024/05/ce441802566ef9f8e6eeb77901e4ec120afed1b6.mp4?_=2"><a href="https://blog.playstation.com/uploads/2024/05/ce441802566ef9f8e6eeb77901e4ec120afed1b6.mp4">https://blog.playstation.com/uploads/2024/05/ce441802566ef9f8e6eeb77901e4ec120afed1b6.mp4</a></video></p><p><strong>Speaking of genre-bending gameplay. <em>Tomba!</em> feels like an open world despite being described as a <a title="Genres > Side-Scrolling [662 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/side-scrolling">side-scrolling</a> <a title="Genres > Platformer [444 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/platformer">platformer</a>. This was largely due to how nonlinearly the levels could be played. Was this done intentionally, or was it something that just happened through development?</strong></p><p><strong>Fujiwara:</strong> “I had envisioned this open-feel game from the very beginning. It was all a blur when things started, but as development progressed, it began taking shape.</p><p>“You could consider <em>Tomba!</em> an open-world title, a term that was rarely used back then. There’s a wide area with a lot of different content in it. You encounter, discover, and collect various things as you move around. For example, you have to complete certain tasks in <em>Tomba!</em>, but you can wander around freely and complete them however you like. Some tasks and main objectives can even be skipped entirely. Many of the ideas I envisioned for <em>Tomba!</em> back in the day were ideas we see in <a title="Genres > Open-World [411 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/open-world">open-world game</a> design today.</p><p>“I initially wanted to include 100 quests, but the final game exceeded that. It was hard work for the team to fit it all together on a timeline. What started out as vague ideas in my head ballooned into an amount of content so large it blew my mind!”</p><p><video id="video-886605-3" width="640" height="360" preload="metadata" controls="controls"><source type="video/mp4" src="https://blog.playstation.com/uploads/2024/05/96a202e9d59d0c32caa77b68a6fd4e000ee1536c.mp4?_=3"><a href="https://blog.playstation.com/uploads/2024/05/96a202e9d59d0c32caa77b68a6fd4e000ee1536c.mp4">https://blog.playstation.com/uploads/2024/05/96a202e9d59d0c32caa77b68a6fd4e000ee1536c.mp4</a></video></p><p><strong>The original PlayStation was a massive leap in gaming technology. What was it like to experience it back then?</strong></p><p><strong>Fujiwara:</strong> “Game development is an ongoing battle against technology growth. This was the case back then and is still true today. I felt that the PlayStation was such a remarkable improvement in terms of hardware, allowing for greater possibilities. Games went from being rendered in pixels to CG. Game developers had to learn many new skills. Expectations ballooned along with the scope of game ideas. Development environments evolved, which made things challenging but exciting for developers. The introduction of the PlayStation and the advancements from that era still impact games today.”</p><p><video id="video-886605-4" width="640" height="360" preload="metadata" controls="controls"><source type="video/mp4" src="https://blog.playstation.com/uploads/2024/05/326465c08e25068fc5d7c1fad02537adf2006ecf.mp4?_=4"><a href="https://blog.playstation.com/uploads/2024/05/326465c08e25068fc5d7c1fad02537adf2006ecf.mp4">https://blog.playstation.com/uploads/2024/05/326465c08e25068fc5d7c1fad02537adf2006ecf.mp4</a></video></p><p><strong>Finally, why do you think it’s important to bring <em>Tomba!</em> back now?</strong></p><p><strong>Fujiwara:</strong> “<em>Tomba!</em> has been around for a long time, but continues to be loved by many. I’ve long wished that the game could be accessible to more people on modern systems. Now that the opportunity is here, I think PlayStation fans today will get a ton of enjoyment out of <em>Tomba!</em>“</p></blockquote></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
