            <p>Recent data states Rockstar's GTA trilogy has hit a combined total of over 30m downloads on Netflix.</p>
<p>Grand Theft Auto 3, Vice City, and San Andreas <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/grand-theft-auto-3-vice-city-and-san-andreas-heading-to-netflix-in-december">made their way onto the service in December</a>, following earlier reports that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/netflix-reportedly-looking-to-license-gta-title-as-it-moves-into-higher-end-gaming">Netflix had been in talks with Rockstar</a> to licence a GTA game as part of an attempt to introduce "higher-end" titles to its mobile-focused gaming catalogue.</p>
<p>In January, it was subsequently reported that the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/netflixs-monthly-game-downloads-nearly-tripled-to-28m-in-december-thanks-to-gta">arrival of these three games had given a boost to Netflix's gaming endeavours</a>, with monthly mobile game downloads nearly tripling to 28m in the December. 18m of these downloads were a combination of San Andreas, Vice City, and GTA 3.</p>

<p>Now, several months down the road, that number has increased to over 30m Netflix downloads for the GTA games. According to <a href="https://appmagic.rocks/">Appmagic</a> data compiled by <a href="https://mobilegamer.biz/rockstars-gta-trilogy-hits-30m-downloads-on-netflix/">mobilegamer.biz</a>, San Andreas has had 20.5m downloads to date, Vice City has had 6.5m and GTA 3 has had 3.3m. </p>
<p>The majority of these GTA downloads have been on Apple devices. Meanwhile, most of the downloads were from the US.</p>
<p>As the publication notes, this means GTA is the biggest game series released through Netflix to date.

<p>Rockstar's GTA series remains one of the most prominent in the industry today. Back in May, it was announced the studio's seemingly evergreen <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-5-sales-have-topped-a-staggering-200m">GTA 5 has now sold over 200m copies</a>. Meanwhile, when Rockstar revealed its first trailer for GTA 6 towards the end of last year, it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-proves-its-dominance-as-trailer-breaks-youtube-records">quickly broke YouTube records</a>, becoming the most viewed video in 24 hours (that wasn't a music video), hitting an astonishing 90m in its first day.</p>
<p>GTA 6 is set to release on consoles during the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/grand-theft-auto-6-coming-in-fall-2025-publisher-take-two-reveals">autumn next year</a> - a launch window <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/grand-theft-auto-6-publisher-highly-confident-of-autumn-2025-release-window">publisher Take-Two has said it is "highly confident" in</a>.</p>
<p>I do wonder whatever happened to that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/meta-staying-quiet-on-status-of-grand-theft-auto-san-andreas-vr">GTA San Andreas VR port</a> that was announced ages ago...?</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/fumes-is-a-max-max-tinted-open-world-twisted-metal-full-of-absolutely-furious-rally-cars<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>
Fumes has starred in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fumes">a few Screenshot Saturday round-ups</a> but this is the first time, to my knowledge, that somebody from the Treehouse has slipped behind the wheel and taken this crusty old banger for a spin. I am glad to have done so. Created by a team of four, Fumes is the Mad Max X Vigilante 8 adaptation somebody really should have made in the 90s, when the very thought of such a thing would have had me flipping tables and then sheepishly righting them again, before being sent to bed with no dinner.</p>
<p>It's an <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-open-world-games">open world</a> combat racer with boisterous arcade handling, pop-out guns that wiggle about like hood ornaments, some kaiju-wannabe boss vehicles, a delightfully crunchy, sooty artstyle and a passably earwormy metal soundtrack. I'm not <em>entirely</em> convinced it has longevity beyond its impeccably scorched and dented PS1 vibes, but I definitely think you should try the demo, now that the early access version is out.<!--more-->
</p>
<p>
At the very least, you can watch the latest trailer, below, though I must caution you that it was made for the PC Gaming Show and contains PCGamer branding. Don't worry: there are representations of rocks and shotguns in the footage, too, and some of those bits of flying detritus are likely pieces of paper. Thanks for the promotion, FUMES team!

<p>
As described on its <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1920430/FUMES/">Steam page</a>, Fumes "is a single-player game inspired by the golden era of vehicular combat genre. Straight-forward, fast paced, intense gameplay. Get into the car, slap some weapons on and cruise twisted wastes." Don't mind if I do. There's an upgrades treadmill and customisation element in the shape of a mobile chop shop, but it doesn't feel like a game where you've got to add 5% to your spiked fender every 10 minutes to survive. Missions consist of racing or massacring the other drivers that throng the wilderness, delivering packages and wrecking bosses, some of which are large enough I'd love to board them using a jump ramp and play Fumes like a post-apocalyptic rodeo machine.
</p>
<p>
I'm not sure if Fumes has a story beyond the timeless Dostoevskian tale of cars killing cars for parts, but it has a storied landscape. Travel far enough in a direction and you'll encounter beached tankers (some of which have monster tyres), skeletal oil rigs and some surprisingly green and flourishing swathes of forestland. I'm not trying to portray this as a meticulous piece of found storytelling, but there are hints of a pre-apocalyptic past to occupy the voyager when you aren't busy murdering icecream vans. Anyway, they're saying it'll be in early access for roughly a year, with the current build offering "all core features and a few hours of gameplay".</p>
<p>In other news, I've just checked the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vehicular_combat_game">Wikipedia page for "vehicular combat game"</a> and they're saying it's a dead genre. Iunno what to think of that, but it's certainly been a while since the last Destruction Derby.</p>

And look, those things take time. I don’t think it’s bad for people to miss things. We just want to get it right and make sure that everything we’re doing in a franchise, whether it’s <em>Elder Scrolls</em>, <em>Fallout</em>, or now<em> Starfield</em>, that those become meaningful moments for everybody who loved these franchises as much as we do.</p></blockquote><h2 id="h655446"><a id=""></a>A new <em>Fallout </em>might not happen anytime soon</h2><p>That’ll be bad news for anyone who was hoping Bethesda might pivot to getting the next <em>Fallout </em>game out sooner in the wake of the<em> Fallout</em> TV show’s wild success and breakout popularity beyond the existing fan base. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/fallout-5-show-todd-howard-amazon-1851325762&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/fallout-5-show-todd-howard-amazon-1851325762"><em>Fallout 5</em></a></span>, or whatever the studio decides to call it, is currently slated to go into production after<em> The Elder Scrolls VI </em>is complete, which is likely still many years away as well at this point. </p><p>The recent boost in popularity, including <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/fallout-4-ps5-ps-plus-steam-mods-game-pass-bugs-1851438302&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/fallout-4-ps5-ps-plus-steam-mods-game-pass-bugs-1851438302"><em>Fallout 4</em>'s next-gen update</a></span> making it one of April’s most-downloaded games, renewed speculation about whether Bethesda would be willing to hand-off the franchise to a third-party again, like it <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/fallout-new-vegas-timeline-canon-todd-howard-1851416601&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/fallout-new-vegas-timeline-canon-todd-howard-1851416601">did with Obsidian Entertainment for <em>Fallout: New Vegas</em></a></span>. Given that the studio is now part of Microsoft, there’s a lot of other internal teams it could partner with to potentially put out a smaller spin-off based in that world in the short-term.</p><p>But nothing Howard said in the interview suggested that’s currently one of Bethesda’s goals for the franchise. It doesn’t sound like remasters of <em>Fallout 1</em> and <em>2</em> are on the table either. The CRPGs developed by Interplay Entertainment before Bethesda purchased the license are isometric and more punishing. They’re great but much harder to get into in the year 2024. </p><figure id="" data-id="de6637b15951f66cf3e203948a12314e" data-recommend-id="image://de6637b15951f66cf3e203948a12314e" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="An astronaut approaches their ship.

He didn’t directly address rumors of <em>Fallout 3 </em>or <em>The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion </em>remasters, so it’s unclear if the studio would feel similarly about modernizing them.<br></p><p>Instead, the director talked about how the team is trying to support existing games for longer. We’ve obviously seen that with <em>Fallout 76</em>, which is now in its sixth year, in the best shape it’s ever been, and is gaining players rather than losing them. Even though<em> Starfield</em> is a single-player game, it sounds like Bethesda might be taking a longer view with its offline RPGs moving forward as well. </p><h2 id="h655447"><a id=""></a><em>Starfield </em>could be supported for years to come</h2><p>For example, Howard said he’d wished the team had supported <em>The Elder Scrolls IV: Skyrim</em> for longer given how long it kept selling and being widely-played for. Starfield is currently set to get its first expansion, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/xbox-showcase-starfield-shattered-space-1851528944&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-showcase-starfield-shattered-space-1851528944"><em>Shattered Space</em></a></span>, later this year, but it won’t be the only one. “We’re planning for the one after this, so there will be another one,” he confirmed in the interview. </p><p>It also sounds like the currently announced DLC will address some of the bigger criticisms of the base game, namely how empty, scattered, and repetitive it began to feel due in part to its procedurally generated worlds. <em>Shattered Space</em>, on the other hand, sounds pretty hand-crafted, focusing on a particular city and questline.</p><p> “Content wise, we’re looking at what we did with <em>Far Harbor</em> on<em> Fallout 4,” </em>Howard told MrMattyPlays. “This is a scope that works for our development in doing this annual story expansion type of thing. So really excited about that, and it lets us do some things the way we would in previous games and give people not completely that experience because it’s still<em> Starfield</em>, but this new kind of alien world that you’re able to explore and it takes place there.”</p><p><em>Shattered Space </em>still doesn’t have a release date beyond fall 2024, but the expansion looked great when shown during Microsoft’s recent Xbox showcase. It might be exactly what the sci-fi RPG needs to win more people over. The DLC will also be available on Game Pass once it’s out. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p dir="ltr"><em>Ahead of the June 2024 Nintendo Direct, we're taking a look back at the company's history of June and E3-centric events.</em></p><p dir="ltr">Though the industry has since moved on from E3, it was once the most consequential event of the year for video games. Long before publishers could disseminate news through social media channels and live streams, they traditionally reserved their biggest announcements and reveals for the expo, making it the stage for some of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/remembering-e3s-biggest-and-best-moments-and-annou/1100-6474770/">most memorable moments in gaming history</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">Among these is Nintendo’s E3 2004 press conference, a presentation that’s remembered fondly for introducing some notable games--and faces--to the gaming public. Given Nintendo’s precarious standing in the industry at the time, this particular E3 was a crucial moment for the company, a chance to dispel the gloom surrounding GameCube’s lagging sales and reaffirm that Nintendo still had what it took to compete in the increasingly crowded home console market. Not only did the presentation ultimately exceed fan expectations, it in many ways signaled the start of a new era for the company.</p><p dir="ltr">By the time E3 2004 rolled around, Nintendo was at a critical juncture. Two years into Satoru Iwata’s tenure as president, the company’s prospects seemed bleak. For all the strides Iwata had made in repairing relations with third parties, the GameCube continued to struggle in the face of stiff competition from the unstoppable PS2 and Microsoft’s Xbox, while the once-uncontested Game Boy Advance was about to face its most formidable challenger yet in Sony’s newly announced PSP.</p><p dir="ltr">Moreover, the company was coming off of a disappointing showing at the previous year’s expo. Nintendo spent an inordinate amount of its E3 2003 press conference demonstrating GameCube-Game Boy Advance connectivity--a novel concept that birthed some genuinely creative gaming experiences in Pac-Man Vs. and Final Fantasy Crystal Chronicles, but one that hardly ignited much interest among hardcore gamers or spurred console sales. Coupled with the lack of any truly major announcements, the presentation underwhelmed fans and did little to assuage worries about the GameCube’s future.</p><p dir="ltr">As such, a lot was riding on Nintendo’s E3 2004 showcase--and it would end up marking a pivotal turning point for the company. The press conference kicked off with the public debut of Nintendo’s new executive vice president of sales and marketing, Reggie Fils-Aime, who in fairly short order would go on to become president of Nintendo of America and the face of the company’s Western operations for the next 15 years (not to mention inspire a treasure trove of memes). Reggie opened the presentation with a decidedly un-Nintendo introduction: “My name is Reggie. I’m about kicking ass, I’m about taking names, and we’re about making games.”</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=59gY8iJ4DWw" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/59gY8iJ4DWw" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">Nintendo wasted little time illustrating that final point, immediately showcasing three hotly anticipated titles coming to the GameCube in the near future: Metroid Prime 2: Echoes, Star Fox Assault, and Capcom’s Resident Evil 4. The tone of the conference was a stark contrast to the previous year’s. Nintendo made a conscious effort to repair its image among core gamers and spent the opening moments of the presentation highlighting a slate of mature games aimed squarely at ardent fans. Though it wasn’t enough to ultimately reverse the GameCube’s fortunes, Metroid Prime 2 and Resident Evil 4 would both go on to earn critical and commercial acclaim, while Star Fox Assault would gain a cult following for its willingness to experiment with the series’ formula.</p><p dir="ltr">At the same time it was courting hardcore gamers, Nintendo also began paving the way into a wider market. Later in the conference, Iwata took the stage to reveal Nintendo’s implicit response to the PSP: the Nintendo DS, an unorthodox dual-screen handheld that featured a touch screen, microphone, and wireless communication. Though initially positioned as a “third pillar” intended to coexist alongside the Game Boy line, the DS was a bold gambit--one that bemused press at the time and served as a test dive into the “blue ocean” strategy Nintendo would fully embrace with its next home console. With the DS, Nintendo was deliberately opting out of the technological arms race that fueled the video game industry. Though the handheld was a marked step up from the Game Boy Advance, it did not strive to compete with the PSP directly in terms of sheer horsepower. Rather, Nintendo traded cutting-edge tech for a number of unique input methods, opening up different forms of interactivity and, in turn, original gameplay experiences not possible on other devices.</p><p dir="ltr">At the time, the gaming media wasn’t quite sure what to make of the DS. Many interpreted it as a nervous Hail Mary, cobbled together quickly in an attempt to stave off the assuredly dominant PSP. As history would prove, however, Nintendo’s gamble was a wise one. Though the DS launched with several traditional games, including a packed-in demo of Metroid Prime Hunters, the device quickly found an audience beyond regular gamers thanks to its approachable interface. Even those who had never played a video game before could easily intuit how to operate the system’s touch screen, which in turn gave rise to a variety of non-traditional games like Nintendogs and Brain Age. Both titles would go on to sell multiple millions of copies, reaching far beyond the traditional gaming market and propelling DS to becoming one of the best-selling systems in history.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4320056-3151062636-71629.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4320056" data-ratio="0.66666666666667" data-width="480" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4320056-3151062636-71629.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4320056"></a><figcaption>Originally boasting a bulky and unconventional design, the Nintendo DS confused and intrigued gamers when it was officially unveiled at E3 2004.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4320056-3151062636-71629.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">The most exciting announcement, however, was yet to come. Following the DS demonstration, Reggie returned to the stage and closed out the presentation by inviting viewers to “step inside one more world” for GameCube. The ensuing trailer slowly panned through a series of realistic fantasy environments, each scene building intrigue and anticipation over what this new mystery title could be. Just as Link rode into focus astride Epona and it became clear that a new Legend of Zelda game was in the works, the audience erupted in cheers, punctuating what was already an exciting press conference with one of the loudest ovations in E3 history.</p><p dir="ltr">The as-yet untitled Zelda game would eventually become Twilight Princess, and its darker, more realistic art style was a clear response to the divisive reaction that greeted Wind Waker and its sunny, cartoonish visuals several years earlier. It was yet further indication that the notoriously obstinate Nintendo was willing to course correct and cater to longtime fans when warranted. Twilight Princess wouldn’t launch for another two years, and while it would still serve as GameCube’s swansong, it would also usher in Nintendo’s next home console, the Wii--another unusual strategy that paid off for the company. Twilight Princess helped propel Wii sales and would go on to move more than eight million copies, making it the best-selling console home installment in the series--a designation it would hold on to for more than a decade until it was eventually overtaken by Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom.</p><p dir="ltr">This eventual success is further proof that E3 2004 was a pivotal moment in Nintendo’s history. After years of struggling to remain relevant in the industry it had helped shape, Nintendo used its press conference to lay the groundwork for a more promising path forward for the company, one that set it up for even greater success than its glory days in the ‘80s and early ‘90s.</p>

                <p>CI Games has announced that a sequel to Lords of the Fallen is currently in development, and it most likely will not be sold on Steam for its PC release.</p><p>CI Games <a href="https://cigames.com/en/ci-games-se-28-2024-signing-of-binding-term-sheet-with-epic-games-inc/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">revealed</a> that Epic Games has the exclusive distribution rights for the Lords of the Fallen sequel on PC for its entire product life cycle. However, the IP rights and publishing rights for other platforms, including PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S, remain with CI Games. The studio mentions that the game is due out in 2026 as well. The announcement refers to it as a sequel to Lords of the Fallen, so it may not actually be called "Lords of the Fallen 2."</p><p>It's unclear if Epic is funding the game's development similar to how it did for Remedy's Alan Wake 2. It's currently an Epic Games Store exclusive and so far shows no signs of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/why-alan-wake-2-isnt-on-steam/1100-6518717/" data-ref-id="1100-6518717">leaving the PC storefront for Steam</a>. Even if Epic isn't funding Lords of the Fallen 2's development, its publishing rights on PC suggest the game will follow the same route and be exclusive to the Epic Games Store.</p><p>Lords of the Fallen is a reboot of the 2014 game with the same name, both of which are heavily inspired by the Souls-like subgenre. One of Lords of the Fallen's unique mechanics is the Umbral Lamp, which lets players switch between the realms of the dead and the living, which opens up new pathways to progress.</p><p>It was released in October 2023 for PC on both Steam and Epic Games Store, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S. In GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/lords-of-the-fallen-review-dark-slog/1900-6418133/" data-ref-id="1900-6418133">Lords of the Fallen review</a>, we said, "While Lords of the Fallen has all the right Souls-like elements, its disjointed pacing and painful checkpoint system make much of the game a slow and frustrating march."</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gamesindustry.biz/inside-the-making-of-astro-bot<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>During Summer Games Fest last week, I frequently asked our friends in the games media what they've seen or played that's impressed them. We don't get to play as much as we'd like at <em>GamesIndustry.biz</em>, and so it's useful intel to hear what the journalists think.</p>
<p>In almost every conversation, one game would come up again and again: Astro Bot.</p>
<p>Thankfully, that was one we did play. The 3D platformer is the follow-up to Astro's Playroom, a small game that's included with every PS5 and showcases the capabilities of the console's DualSense controller. The quality of Astro's Playroom prompted Sony to invest in the developer behind it, Team Asobi, and now they're building a full follow-up, which launches this September.</p>
<p>When we <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/team-asobi-we-want-our-games-to-feel-like-theyre-made-in-japan">first caught up with Team Asobi back in 2022</a>, it shared with us how the studio operated. There is a core team working on Astro Bot, with a smaller group prototyping new ideas outside of the game.</p>
<figure>
<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/img_DL93Djd.jpg?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">
 </a>
<figcaption>Nicolas Doucet, Team Asobi</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>"They are not bound to platforming," explains studio and creative director Nicolas Doucet. "That was on purpose so they don't feel limited. Otherwise, your brain puts in all sorts of restrictions."</p>
<p>Back in 2022, Asobit was around 60 employees, with Doucet expecting it to grow to 100. Instead, they've just added "a handful more" in the two years since.</p>
<p>"We've kept it quite tight," he says. "Even though this game is obviously bigger, it really comes down to people knowing the game well. It's a good size."</p>
<p>During our previous interview, we touched upon the way Asobi makes its games. They come up with a wealth of ideas, assigns people to them, then gets everyone together after two weeks to showcase, play and review the work.</p>
<p>"We do that right until the end," Doucet tells us. "Now we are in the final, final phase in the game, we replay so much everyday that it's less of a necessity. But it's really needed as we're finding our way. It means everybody keeps track of where we are, but also has a chance to showcase two weeks of work and see people's reaction. A lot of what we do are bite-sized moments of humour and maybe interactive objects, like a toy. They don't take time to make, it's just a large amount of individual pieces. [These check-ins] means you can check you're on the right track, and you're also spotlighting your own work, which can be a powerful motivation."</p>
<p>These meetings feature all 60 employees and last about two and a half hours. An artist might be showcasing several 3D models, or several pages of storyboarding, while an animator goes through multiple animations.</p>
<p>"For a programmer, it might be a prototype," Doucet continues. "It wouldn't be inside the game directly yet, but it would be in a little room that they built for themselves. So in the [Summer Game Fest gameplay demo], you have that bit where the bulldog is on your back and smashes through things. Well in two weeks, a programmer might have the first prototype of that. It won't be a bulldog, probably just a rocket. The idea is to make the gameplay feel good and you can go around this white room and smash things."</p>
<figure>
<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/Screenshot-2024-06-17-093008.jpg?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">
 </a>
<figcaption>The rocket bulldog from Astro Bot would have started life as a prototype built in two weeks</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>After these meetings, the team gives their opinions and decisions are made over what to do next.</p>
<p>"Usually it's quite obvious when something is going well. You can gauge it from the reaction of the team. I watch people a lot, because when you're talking about humour, sometimes we have different sensitivities to something that might be funny. And if you see people finding something funny… I tend to put my own feelings aside. It's just one person's view. If the whole group is having a moment where they feel something is really great, that's a good gauge.</p>
<p>"And for things that don’t go well… at the end of the review, everybody gets to say one thing they enjoyed, and one thing that should be improved. And that usually highlights trends towards what is popular and what isn't, and out of that we take actions for the next two weeks."</p>
<p>My mind immediately went to what happens when something someone has spent weeks or months building ends up not impressing the team and cut from the game.</p>
<p>"There are features in the game, even entire levels, which take a good amount of time, several weeks, and we are like: 'You know what, it feels like a double of that other level. And to finish it will be a big investment, and the return on that investment for the player is almost zero, so let's not do it'," Doucet admits.</p>
<blockquote><p>"With the adaptive triggers and haptics, we really went to town"</p></blockquote>
<p>"Of course, when having those conversations we need to be polite and respectful. But fundamentally, everyone understands that it always come from the players' benefit point-of-view. When you have your level canned, you might go home feeling not so good, but the next day, you'll always be working on something that interests you. As long as we can keep that going, I think it's fine. Putting ego to the side in general, and this is valid for everyone, is probably the best way to have a sane positive mindset.</p>
<p>"Also, there is always the prospect that you're cutting something that could be reused in the DLC or a sequel. There is always that hope."</p>
<p>Indeed, Asobi is meticulous when it comes to archiving all of the ideas that end up not making it into the game.</p>
<p>"Our ability to archive is really important," Doucet says. "In the first year of a project like this, you do a lot of tests. Second year, you really build the game with all the tests that you did. And then the third year you are polishing everything. Roughly speaking that is how it goes. That means, by the time we finish, the exploration part was a long time ago. And there is a risk that we will forget a lot of stuff.</p>
<p>"Also, some of these ideas are running on old versions of the game, which we cannot run anymore. So being able to go back and have this archive of good ideas, it is something we realised is really important. Otherwise, you end up re-inventing the wheel, or worse, forgetting about an amazing idea that we had that didn't fit for X or Y reason.</p>
<p>"It could just be confidence at that time. Or maybe there was just more interest elsewhere. And if your expectations drop a bit, you might allow something that you previously rejected back into your thinking, and from that you get a genius idea."</p>
<p>This is the development process that has led to the demo we played in LA last week, which was crammed full of ideas, and with gameplay that feels as good as the very best platformers.</p>
<p>Yet for all the inevitable comparisons to Nintendo's platform games, this is distinctly a PlayStation title. On a superficial level, the game is filled with PlayStation iconography and characters. This is one thing that has been brought across from Astro's Playroom, and Doucet admitted there was some reservations around doing the same thing again.</p>
<p>"We thought… if we lean too much into PlayStation, are we not allowing Astro be its own thing? Will we know if he can stand on his own feet? So the first thing was to prototype all these ideas in the Astro world only. But then we realised, if you're a fan of PlayStation and Astro's Playroom, which had all these things in it, and then the next game didn't… I'd be disappointed, honestly."</p>

<figcaption>Astro Bot is once again filled with PlayStation iconography</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>So the team decided to do it again, but this time they went further, with over 150 characters, including Astro versions of Kratos (God of War), Drake (Uncharted) and Aloy (Horizon), to find and collect.</p>
<p>"It is a bit of a geek dream," Doucet says. "They're not just characters, they have meaning and are very close to our hearts. When you grow up with a game, it's not just a game, it was part of your life, which means there is an emotional attachment. So hopefully everyone will find their favourite ones."</p>
<p>The characters aren't named, but their designs and descriptions – written by Dan Meher – should prove enough to work out who they are. The game does poke fun at the characters, as is the nature of Astro Bot's humour, and Doucet says that the other PlayStation studios were very receptive to this presentation of their IP.</p>
<p>"There is a place where you can collect these characters, a museum, and you can punch them to get a funny reaction," Doucet says. "And those reactions really go deep into the things they did in their games. So we are always trying to be very respectful, but also taking the piss and being funny with those IPs.</p>
<p>"The other studios have really embraced it. There hasn't been anything difficult. A lot of these IPs have quite dramatic stories with deep characters. And we're making them funny, so Kratos gets angry, but it's kind of cute angry. And there has been a real acceptance to that. I was thinking this was going to be really complicated and administration heavy. But it was really smooth sailing."</p>
<blockquote><p>"There are so many things that are bound to the essence of PlayStation with this game, that it is difficult to imagine it elsewhere"</p></blockquote>
<p>The other element that makes this distinctly a PlayStation game is how Astro Bot, like with Playroom, leans heavily on the features of the DualSense controller. Doucet says they've gone further this time and highlights the sponge concept as an example.</p>
<p>"That idea came from these isolated demos we were doing outside of Astro," he explains. "We were looking at the kind of expression we can do with the adaptive trigger, and we came up with a sponge made of water, and when you squeeze the water out, it then becomes light. You can program the trigger to have more or less resistant. We did this prototype, which was just a sponge on the screen you could squeeze, and it felt really good, so that informed a part of Astro.</p>
<p>"There is also another feature in the game called 'feel the wall'. You can see a gold wall and Astro can run his hands against it, and you can feel the change of texture in the DualSense as he goes from smooth to rough and then smooth again. Then you go back to the rough part, push it, and it's a secret passage. It's something kind of magical. You've seen it before with things like Indiana Jones. It could be done with normal vibration, but it would be a bit mundane, and with the DualSense you can really feel the smooth and rough."</p>
<p>However, there are some parts of the controller the team has scaled back on compared with Astro's Playroom.</p>
<p>"With Astro's Playroom being a tech demo, we wanted to use every feature [of the controller]. So you'd have the platforming, then it would go to a minigame, then back to platforming. It was separated," Doucet says. "But this time, it is all blended together. All the new [powers] support the fundamental jumping around. That means we are doing less with the touchpad, because using the touchpad means your fingers are coming off the jump button and it becomes a clunky way to play. But with the adaptive triggers and haptics, we really went to town."</p>
<p>And indeed, it was this that seemed to excite many of the journalists we spoke to in Los Angeles. In an era where most games, even first-party games, have been built so that they can be played across all sorts of devices – mobile, consoles and PC – it's exciting to find something that has been very purposefully created for one platform.</p>
<p>Doucet concludes: "Very often we have this conversation. There are so many things that are bound to the essence of PlayStation with this game, that it is difficult to imagine it elsewhere. It is really built for PlayStation."</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/blue-lock-broke-through-the-sports-anime-wall-in-my-heart/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=blue-lock-broke-through-the-sports-anime-wall-in-my-heart<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="382" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Anime has been a huge focal point of my life since a very young age, cheering on Gohan to defeat Cell in <em>Dragon Ball Z</em> and Yugi to win the Battle City Tournament in <em>Yu-Gi-Oh!</em> However, one genre of anime always disinterested me and that was sports. No sports anime ever caught my attention for very long, with the exception of <em>Yuri on Ice!!</em>, rest in peace. That is, until <em>Blue Lock</em>. </p> <p data-characters="484" data-current-count="484" data-injectable="true">I certainly tried my fair share of sports anime throughout the years, including the fan-favorites like <em>Haikyuu!</em> and <em>Free</em>. Outside of the super catchy musical openings and endings, I didn’t stick around for long. <em>Blue Lock</em>, however, immediately swept me off my feet and I recently binged the entire first season in a matter of two days. This is largely because of the excellent soccer matches, sure, but also the phenomenal way in which <em>Blue Lock</em> frames its storyline and characters.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Eight Bit</figcaption></figure> <h2 id="h-squid-game-like-setting-works-wonders" data-injectable="false"><em>Squid Game</em>-like setting works wonders</h2> <p data-characters="354" data-current-count="654" data-injectable="true">A huge part of why <em>Blue Lock</em> gripped me in a way no other sports anime has comes down to the immediate premise, which feels like a battle royale or <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/squid-game-season-2-release-window-on-netflix-trailer-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Squid Game</a></em>-like competition. The goal of the titular Blue Lock competition is to find the best Japanese high school soccer players to craft a national team able to compete with the greats in the World Cup. </p>
 <p data-characters="317" data-current-count="317" data-injectable="false">Each episode feels like a reality TV show in how the contestants compete in various challenges or soccer matches to whittle down the number of players from the initial 300 students all the way down to the handful of winners. This adds a level of intensity and heartbreak I haven’t seen in any other similar series. </p> <p data-characters="352" data-current-count="669" data-injectable="true">Right off the bat, without going too deep into spoilers, the series eliminates one of the most promising potential villains from the Blue Lock competition without a care in the world. The series is absolutely brutal because of this, frequently removing important characters from the story in surprising and relentless ways without a moment’s notice. </p>
 <p data-characters="253" data-current-count="253" data-injectable="false">In the first season alone of <em>Blue Lock</em>, there are a couple of standout moments that rival the renowned sixth episode of <em>Squid Game</em>. This setup is so incredible; it feeds that one-more-episode drive, and it even won over sports anime haters like myself. </p> <figure data-current-count="553" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Eight Bit</figcaption></figure>
 <h2 id="h-selfish-protagonist-helps-to-differentiate" data-injectable="false">Selfish protagonist helps to differentiate</h2> <p data-characters="419" data-current-count="419" data-injectable="true">You can even feel the winner-takes-all mentality of the <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/blue-lock-episode-nagi-movie-release-date-and-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Blue Lock</em></a> series in its central protagonist, Yoichi Isagi. Isagi is by far one of the most selfish and inconsiderate “heroes” I’ve seen in an anime. He is in the competition only for himself, to prove that he is the number-one striker in all of Japan. Isagi’s personality is fascinatingly abrasive, to the point I didn’t even like him half the time.</p>
 <p data-characters="682" data-current-count="682" data-injectable="true">That might seem odd and like a negative, but I find a more complicated protagonist makes a series all the more intriguing and fun to watch. He reminds me of Lelouch from <em>Code Geass</em>, in a way. Isagi makes some questionable decisions, but I can’t stop watching. At times, Isagi is honestly a bit hard to root for when he betrays a teammate or makes himself the one to get the glory for a key goal, but this makes him all the more compelling to watch. Isagi feels more realistic than the typical overly optimistic anime protagonist. He is all about furthering his own career no matter who he has to push aside. Seeing how Isagi’s recklessness affects his relationships is enticing.</p>
 <p data-characters="294" data-current-count="294" data-injectable="false">This selfish idea applies to the supporting cast, too. They all have their own motivations and goals in the competition, most of which aren’t exactly altruistic or friendly. It feels refreshing to have a series where it isn’t all about the power of friendship or a happy-go-lucky storyline.</p> <figure data-current-count="594" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Eight Bit</figcaption></figure>
 <h2 id="h-stellar-action-and-drama-on-and-off-the-field" data-injectable="false">Stellar action and drama on and off the field</h2> <p data-characters="479" data-current-count="479" data-injectable="true">If there is one part about <em>Blue Lock</em> you can bet your money on, it is how high the stakes are. It doesn’t matter if you are on the field or off it; everything is so dramatic. The action and drama are top notch from start to finish in the first season of the series, complete with detailed and gorgeous animation to match this. However, this isn’t necessarily unique to this particular series. Most sports anime at least have this part down, which is the genre is so popular. </p>
 <p data-characters="429" data-current-count="429" data-injectable="true">That said, I tried other soccer anime in the past, such as <em>Aoashi</em>. As a former high school soccer player myself, I can say these other series adapted the action quite well. Everything from dribbling, passing, shooting goals, and tackling look great. However, series like <em>Aoashi</em> felt just a little bit too safe and tame for my liking. <em>Blue Lock</em>, on the other hand, ensures every moment on the field is as over-the-top as it gets. </p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Eight Bit</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="454" data-current-count="754" data-injectable="true">There are plenty of twists, superpower moments, and going to the next level in the middle of the soccer matches. This makes the series almost feel like a nonstop iteration of the Tournament of Power from <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/is-dragon-ball-super-season-2-actually-happening-speculation-and-rumors-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dragon Ball Super</a></em>. But even when the story quiets down off the field, it still doesn’t hold back in the drama department. There are so many betrayals, back-stabbings, and surprises that keep the viewer on their toes in almost every single episode. </p>
 <p data-characters="309" data-current-count="309" data-injectable="false">You could argue the series doesn’t take enough time to pause from the constant twists and turns. This is fair. It doesn’t slow down enough in some key moments. But if you want a show with breakneck pacing, look no further. I appreciated how it respects the viewer’s time. Filler isn’t a problem here. </p> <p data-characters="335" data-current-count="644" data-injectable="false">Overall, <em>Blue Lock</em> is the perfect anime for newcomers to sports anime to check out. It won this sports anime hater over due to its battle royale-like premise, stellar cast of morally gray and sometimes unlikable characters, and nonstop action and drama. This is the type of series you’ll want to start and not stop until it’s over.</p>

<p data-characters="267" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Hey, remember that time <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/twitch-plays-pokemon-is-now-playing-pokemon-crystal/">Twitch played Pokémon</a>? An amusing endeavor, I’m sure many of you will agree. Well, what if we did the same thing but with another game. Say…<em>Doom</em>? Oh man, that would be pretty amusing to see and not at all complicated to actualize.</p> <p data-characters="350" data-current-count="350" data-injectable="false">Well, would you look at that. Someone’s only gone and done it. YouTuber ThePrimeagen has managed to make the original <em>Doom</em> capable of being played by simultaneous Twitch viewers; 1,000 of them, to be precise. Now, it should be said that this is technically an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ASCII</a> version of the classic FPS, but it still stands as an entertaining experiment.</p> <figure data-current-count="650" data-injectable="true"><p> <iframe title="1000 People Play Doom At Once" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/3f9tbqSIm-E?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure>
 <p data-characters="444" data-current-count="444" data-injectable="true">Needless to say, the above video contains <em>a lot</em> of complex information about how they were able to convert and compress the game in such a way as to make it playable via a chat log. I’m not even going to attempt to explain it, as the knowledge I have of programming and software engineering is on par with my expertise on hyperlocal economics in the region of – oh, I don’t know – the town of Shitterton in England (look it up).</p>
 <h2 id="h-it-s-real" data-injectable="false">It’s real</h2> <p data-characters="250" data-current-count="250" data-injectable="false">If you want to just see the part where 1,000 people play the opening section of <em>Doom</em>, you will need to pretty much skip to the last minute of the video. If you are genuinely fascinated by how it’s all achieved, I’ll see you in 15 minutes.</p> <p data-characters="223" data-current-count="473" data-injectable="true">Right at the end, we get to see the final result of ThePrimeagen’s work, which involves tasking people in Twitch chat to control <em>Doom</em>. You all know how this work, which means you probably also know how this turns out.</p>
 <p data-characters="310" data-current-count="310" data-injectable="false">There are a large number of hiccups along the way, including Doom Guy continually falling down a staircase before he’s able to get up it. However, the effort is worth the wait, as the viewers do manage to complete the first level of <em>Doom</em>, tricky though it clearly was. Isn’t technology pretty cool?</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/lords-of-fallen-2-2026-epic-exclusive<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>CI Games has revealed that&nbsp;<em>Lords of the Fallen 2&nbsp;</em>is due sometime in 2026, and not only that - it'll be an Epic Games Store exclusive when it launches on PC.</p>
<p>According to a <a href="https://www.bankier.pl/wiadomosc/CI-GAMES-S-E-Podpisanie-Binding-Term-Sheet-z-Epic-Games-Inc-8765997.html#pvy7zfso61" rel="noopener" target="_blank">binding term sheet</a> signed between CI and Epic, the upcoming&nbsp;<em>Lords of the Fallen&nbsp;</em>sequel (which, according to past form, will probably also be called&nbsp;<em>Lords of the Fallen</em>) is targeting a 2026 release window.</p>
<p>It doesn't sound like the game will be coming to Steam at all, either. The term agreement says that Epic has "exclusive worldwide distribution rights" on PC for "the entire product life cycle", so it looks like you won't be playing&nbsp;<em>Lords of the Fallen 2</em>-slash-<em>3&nbsp;</em>on Steam.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/lords-of-the-fallen-2-2026-epic-lotf-screenshot.jpg?itok=qfpE_ySD 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/lords-of-the-fallen-2-2026-epic-lotf-screenshot.jpg?itok=o626qguk 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Lords of the Fallen&nbsp;</em>appeared on Steam, but it looks like&nbsp;<em>Lords of the Fallen 2&nbsp;</em>won't.</figcaption></figure><p>The game will still be released on PS5 and Xbox Series X|S, though, and CI Games is retaining publishing rights, so&nbsp;<em>Lords of the Fallen 2&nbsp;</em>won't be published by Epic.</p>
<p>Since we're a long way out from 2026 at time of writing, a lot could change between now and the sequel's release, but if this agreement holds, then you might have to make the switch if you want to enjoy CI Games' followup to its 2023 Soulslike.</p>
<p>This is also the first concrete confirmation that CI Games'&nbsp;<em>Project 3</em>, which the studio has <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ci-games-layoffs-lords-of-fallen">spoken about in the past</a>, is definitely a followup to&nbsp;<em>Lords of the Fallen&nbsp;</em>and not an action-RPG under the umbrella of a separate IP.</p>
<p><em>Project 3&nbsp;</em>isn't CI Games' only title in the pipeline, though; the studio is also working alongside internal outfit Underdog on&nbsp;<em>Project Survive</em>, although details are scant about that game right now.</p>

<p><em>Lords of the Fallen&nbsp;</em>is a Soulslike that tasks you with traveling the land of Mournstead in order to prevent the revival of the dark god Adyr. Along the way, you can expect tons of fallen knights to slaughter, as well as big bosses to take down and sprawling levels to explore.</p>

EA's top execs earned $60m in the fiscal year 2024, despite the company laying off hundreds of employees.
</p>
<p>
In particular CEO Andrew Wilson earned just under half that number himself - $25.6m - and was praised for executing on "key strategic and operating objectives".
</p>
<p>
Those objectives include reorganising the business into EA Entertainment and EA Sports; "optimising our portfolio, investments and resources in support of our strategic priorities and growth initiatives" as part of a restructuring plan; progressing the company's "long-term strategy plan focused on driving durable growth, strong cash flow and stockholder returns"; and overseeing a "year of continued employee satisfaction scores above industry benchmarks", which included "record high talent retention".

<p>

These numbers come courtesy of an annual Proxy Statement, which details the compensation of EA's execs, as spotted by <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/ea-execs-earned-60-million-in-2024-despite-layoffs-and-office-closures">Game Developer</a>.

</p>
<p>
Breaking it down, Wilson earned $1.3m from his basic salary, plus over $20m in stock awards, just under $3.5m from a non-equity incentive plan, and $500k in "other" compensation. This, in total, was around $5m more than in 2023 and 2022.
</p>
<p>
Elsewhere Laura Miele, president of EA Entertainment, technology and central development, earned a total of $12m, acknowledging her assumed leadership of EA Entertainment and overseeing the Star Wars Jedi: Survivor launch, among other achievements.
</p>
<p>
Meanwhile CFO Stuart Canfield earned a total of $6.5m, among others.
</p>
<p>
At the very least, it's a stark indication of the amount of money earned at the top of the games industry.
</p>
<p>
By contrast, the median employee earned $148,704 in compensation, meaning Wilson earned 172 times more than the average EA employee.

</p>
<p>
Back in February, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-announces-further-lay-offs-this-time-likely-to-affect-around-670-employees">EA laid off five percent of its staff</a>, amounting to around 670 employees. Wilson said at the time the cuts were part of a continuing effort to "optimise our global real estate footprint to best support our business".

</p>
<p>
These cuts followed a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-laying-off-6-of-its-workforce-as-part-of-restructuring">previous round of "restructuring" in March 2023</a>, which impacted six percent of the workforce (over 750 people).

</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games-industry-layoffs-surpass-10000-for-2024-so-far">Games industry layoffs have surpassed 10,000 for 2024 so far</a>, which is almost as many that were impacted in 2023 in less than half the time.

He comes in the Battle Pass for <em>MultiVersus</em>’ first season, which means returning Open Beta players get him off the bat, and if you’re spending money, he’s a more reasonable return for investment compared to Joker.

If you played the Open Beta and are coming back while the season is active, you don’t even have to pay. Otherwise, you’ll need to wait until the season ends before you can grab Jason as a separate purchase with Gleamium or Fighter Currency.

He also packs a major punch, offering tons of damage per hit compared to the Iron Giant or even Superman. That’s given him the designation of “noob killer,” since getting points off less experienced players takes way less effort than with most other fighters. But the story changes once you get further up the food chain, as using Jason becomes a much more precise affair.<br></p><p>Jason doesn’t automatically have any armor properties, so you can’t just throw out big, meaty moves without fear of consequences. Instead, it’s better to wait for punishment opportunities, or toss out quick moves like his Forward Jab or Ground Up Special (No Escape) to go on the offensive and control screen space. Jason’s Air Neutral Scoop and Slice) or Air Down attack (6 Feet Under Or Go To Hell) are also solid approaching moves that can create combo opportunities.<br></p><p>Jabbing is the ideal, especially because once you confirm the hit you can do all kinds of stuff from there. The basic combo from repeating jab gives you a throw that overrides armor, but you can cancel into lots of other moves to create different scenarios for huge damage. You can get creative, but the easiest move is to use Up Attack (Crunch Time) after the second jab, which lets you create a route to Jason’s absurdly powerful up special.<br></p><p>If you really want to cook with gas, while Jason doesn’t have armor in his normal moveset, you can use his Ground Neutral Special (Unstoppable Rage) to activate his passive. You take some self-inflicted damage, but you get a temporary bump in damage for your next move alongside movement speed and “gray health.” While the gray health is active you don’t take knockback, giving you a chance to really chase someone down and make a huge damage trade in your favor. This is a risky play, but the reward can be enormous.<br></p><figure id="" data-id="fb537835ed1ebe24bc6bcb345a6fbcd5" data-recommend-id="image://fb537835ed1ebe24bc6bcb345a6fbcd5" data-format="jpg" data-width="1600" data-height="900" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Jason's perks screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Jason's perks screen." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Warner Bros. / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="fb537835ed1ebe24bc6bcb345a6fbcd5" data-recommend-id="image://fb537835ed1ebe24bc6bcb345a6fbcd5" data-format="jpg" data-width="1600" data-height="900" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Jason's perks screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><h3 id="h654469"><a id=""></a>What Perks should Jason use?</h3><p>The signature Perk you want to use is Monstrous Sidestep, if you use any. This makes Jason’s Side Special (Mist Step) home in on the closest character, even teleporting behind them if he’s close enough. This helps close distance effectively, which is something Jason can’t do well otherwise. Well Rounded is fine if you want to eke out a little more damage and don’t find the Side Special as useful.<br></p><p>Beyond that, Protective Momentum is great for help against projectiles, another of Jason’s biggest weaknesses. Last Stand is an obvious choice for Tank-style play, while Pugilist is a no-brainer for a pure melee character.</p><h3 id="h654470"><a id=""></a>Okay sure, but is Jason good?</h3><p>Let’s close this out with some opinion work. Jason is super-fun to play, especially if you have love for classic horror movies. Not only is the design great and fitting for the <em>MultiVersus</em> style, but all the little nods to <em>Friday the 13th</em> and jokes in Jason’s moveset are on point. Swinging the classic murder weapons around, with so much weight powering the animations, feels great. The sleeping bag is a hilarious touch as well, and using it can really change the cadence of a match.<br></p><p>He’s definitely tough to use well, though. <em>MultiVersus</em> is a fast game with lots of projectiles, and charging into the fray head-on as Jason is an easy way to lose. Be especially careful about choosing your shots in 2v2, as Jason makes for an excellent punching bag between two players if your partner isn’t there to bail you out.<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The thread opens with a mission statement for the strike. Gemina writes:</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p> I would like to make this the official thread for those in support of a healer strike as a collective voice to the dev team to express the dissatisfaction with the continued direction the game has gone concerning healer gameplay and what is an arrived consensus that has deemed to be a negligence towards the role, as well as the players who main it.</p></blockquote><p>The strike asks any player who participates to abstain from taking on any healer jobs in any group content (dungeons, raids, trials).</p><p>While this is not a new issue for <em>FF14</em>’s healer community, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-14-dawntrail-community-preview-1851521989&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-14-dawntrail-community-preview-1851521989"><em>Dawntrail</em></a></span> previews were the tipping point that led to the strike. Specifically, <em>FF14</em> content creator <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqBWp00XNZs&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VqBWp00XNZs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Xenosys Vex’s preview video</a></span>, showing a four-person party beating the new expansion’s first dungeon, Ihuykatumu, without a healer. Of course, Xenosys used some clever party make-up: The party’s tank was a Warrior, a class known for its self-healing abilities. The Warrior was then supported by three DPS players, with one choosing Red Mage to make use of healing and revival magic without the need for a true healer. Still, it’s not a good look for <em>Dawntrail</em> and it has put a sour taste in many healers’ mouths.</p><p>You may think, based on Xenosys’ preview, that a healer strike might not get anywhere since it proved how useless the role is in even <em>Dawntrail</em>’s basic content. However, when completing party-based content for the first time in <em>FF14,</em> you are required to adhere to a strict party makeup. Four-person content requires one healer, while eight-person content requires two. So players can’t take the Xenosys approach of foregoing healers as soon as <em>Dawntrail</em> launches, and a strike should remind people that they’re being taken for granted.</p><p>The grievances listed by Gemina sum up a building list of issues players have had with the healer role—issues that have only been exacerbated by the imminent changes coming to the new expansion. The <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-14-ff14-dawntrail-healer-job-rework-1851432853&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-14-ff14-dawntrail-healer-job-rework-1851432853">healer community</a></span>, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-14-dawntrail-astrologian-job-changes-1851482090&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-14-dawntrail-astrologian-job-changes-1851482090">me included</a></span>, has long been complaining that each expansion’s job changes have continuously diminished the usefulness of healers in anything but high-end content, in addition to simplifying the actual rotation of play. For example, the average rotation of a White Mage in an encounter is to spam the single target offensive spell Glare, while also keeping the damage over time spell Dia constantly applied to an enemy. Healing is done very rarely. </p><p>That means you spend your time spamming two buttons, which is obviously boring compared to DPS and Tank roles with their more complex and engaging rotations. To make it worse, <em>Dawntrail</em> looks to simplify Astrologian, perhaps the last semi-complex healer job in the game, alongside the continued bolstering of self-healing abilities in tank classes.</p><figure id="" data-id="f4b5d09e0c457123f384c3f807f7a5f2" data-recommend-id="image://f4b5d09e0c457123f384c3f807f7a5f2" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A Viera White Mage casts a spell with a large stagg" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A Viera White Mage casts a spell with a large stagg" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Square Enix / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="f4b5d09e0c457123f384c3f807f7a5f2" data-recommend-id="image://f4b5d09e0c457123f384c3f807f7a5f2" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A Viera White Mage casts a spell with a large stagg" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>As a healer, I understand the frustration that led to the strike. I hope Square Enix is currently working on changes to address these long-vocalized issues. There is even some hope that <em>Dawntrail</em> might offer an olive branch to the healer community. Summoner is losing its ability to revive players, meaning that Red Mage will be the only non-healer role with the ability to revive. That gives healers a little bit of purpose back. Furthermore, the Swiftcast ability is getting a shorter cooldown, something that could signal more challenging content for healers. However, that might still be reserved for high-end content only, which doesn’t exactly fix the problem.<br></p><p>The #FFXIVHEALERSTRIKE thread currently has over 300 pages of comments adding their support. To give players time to complete any <em>Endwalker</em> content they need to before the next expansion, Gemina proposes that the strike does not officially start <em>Dawntrail</em>’s release on July 2.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gameinformer.com/2024/06/17/the-june-nintendo-direct-airs-tomorrow<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text" typeof="schema:Article"><p>Nintendo has announced its <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/news/2024/05/07/nintendo-says-it-will-reveal-switch-successor-by-march-2025-but-not-at-the-direct">previously confirmed summer Direct</a> will air tomorrow, June 18.&nbsp;The roughly 40-minute presentation will focus on games slated for the second half of 2024.</p>

<p>The Direct begins at 7 a.m. PT/10 a.m. ET. Nintendo also reiterates that this presentation will not mention the Switch successor console.</p>



<p>With the next Switch console slated to launch by March 2025, this is likely one of, if not the, last Direct focused entirely on the current Switch. The company's fall calendar currently only has&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/nintendo-direct/2024/02/21/everything-announced-at-todays-nintendo-direct-partner-showcase">Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time</a> as the only Switch-exclusive with a release date (October 10). Beyond third-party multi-platform releases, the back half of the year is pretty barren for Nintendo, so it's likely this Direct will fill in those gaps.&nbsp;</p>

<p>With Summer Game Fest and other big events behind us, this Nintendo Direct is one of the few major showcases remaining. You can keep up with all of the upcoming presentations in our <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2024/05/08/the-2024-summer-gaming-showcase-schedule">2024 Summer Gaming Showcase Schedule</a>.&nbsp;</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nintendo-direct-rounds-out-summer-showcase-season-tomorrow.903381/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-direct-june-2024-announced<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nintendo has announced a Nintendo Direct presentation for tomorrow, and it'll offer information on Switch games coming to the console throughout the second half of 2024.</p>
<p>According to <a href="https://x.com/NintendoAmerica/status/1802702745276662114" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a post on X</a> (formerly Twitter), tomorrow's Direct will offer "roughly 40 minutes" of info on Switch games coming this year. It'll air tomorrow at 10am Eastern (that's 7am Pacific).</p>
<p>One thing that tomorrow's Direct decidedly will not offer, however, is information on the Switch's successor; the X post states clearly that "there will be no mention" of whatever the Switch 2 turns out to be.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/fantasy-life-i-nintendo-direct-june-2024.jpg?itok=PnrwoSye 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/fantasy-life-i-nintendo-direct-june-2024.jpg?itok=RE06QGdz 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Could&nbsp;<em>Fantasy Life i&nbsp;</em>be featured during tomorrow's Nintendo Direct? Time will tell.</figcaption></figure><p>Of course, we already knew that the Switch 2 wouldn't be making an appearance during this summer's Direct presentation.</p>
<p>Back in May, Nintendo president Shuntaro Furukawa <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-announcement-confirmation">promised a Switch 2 announcement</a> sometime before April 2025, but he also said that announcement wouldn't be made during the summer Direct.</p>
<p>As such, if you're hoping to hear about whatever comes after the Switch tomorrow, you'll be disappointed, but that doesn't mean the Direct won't have lots of info for you. The Switch has plenty of games on its 2024 slate, after all.</p>
<p>For the rest of 2024, releases like&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fantasy-life-i-girl-who-steals-time-delayed"><em>Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time</em></a>,&nbsp;<em>SteamWorld Heist 2</em>, and&nbsp;<em>Luigi's Mansion 2 HD&nbsp;</em>are set to launch on Switch, and we'll presumably hear about some games we don't already know about as well.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/luigis-mansion-2-hd-switch-nintendo-direct.jpg?itok=Dj3KlJe7 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/luigis-mansion-2-hd-switch-nintendo-direct.jpg?itok=aow9c6f7 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Are you ready to delve back into&nbsp;<em>Luigi's Mansion 2&nbsp;</em>next week?</figcaption></figure><p>Of course, no discussion of a Nintendo Direct - or, indeed, of any presentation nowadays - would be complete without one thing, so let's acknowledge the elephant in the room, the specter that haunts all gaming discourse.</p>
<p>Will we see&nbsp;<em>Hollow Knight: Silksong&nbsp;</em>during tomorrow's Direct? It's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hollow-knight-silksong-delayed">been a while</a> since we heard anything concrete from Team Cherry about the game, after all, and a <a href="https://www.classification.gov.au/titles/hollow-knight-silksong" rel="noopener" target="_blank">classification in Australia earlier this year</a> sparked fresh rumors that a release date might be imminent.</p>
<p>Let's not get our hopes up, though. There are plenty of games out there to get excited about without worrying about&nbsp;<em>Silksong</em>, even if its absence is causing me pain on a daily basis. Check back tomorrow for everything that's revealed during the Nintendo Direct!</p>

            <p>
The perpetually scarlet-faced and jovially maladroit folk of Embracer have done their usual vaudeville comedy routine of spinning around with negative-dollar signs in their eyes and trampling on another game development studio - in this case, Pieces Interactive, creators of the recent Alone In The Dark reboot. The Swedish studio's <a href="https://www.piecesinteractive.se/">website</a> is now a tombstone, bearing the dates 2007-2024. Oopsy-daisy!
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
Pieces were acquired by Embracer in 2017 as part of a decade-long acquisition binge which came to a rude halt in early 2023, when the reported collapse of a multiple-billion dollar Savvy Games investment deal obliged Embracer to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/embracer-group-to-close-studios-and-cancel-games-as-part-of-restructuring">cut their operations to the bone</a>. In the past financial year, Embracer have given over 4500 employees the chop, closed 44 studios - including Volition and Free Radical - and binned off 80 projects. Among the subsidiary organisations that have survived the cuts are Gearbox, which Embracer have <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/embracer-sell-borderlands-devs-gearbox-to-rockstar-parent-take-two-for-460-million-in-shares">flogged to Take-Two</a>, and Saber Interactive, which Embracer have <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/saber-interactive-splits-from-embracer-taking-3d-realms-slipgate-metro-devs-and-more-with-them">sold to a new company launched by a few of Saber's original founders</a>. 
</p>
<p>
In late March, Embracer <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/embracer-say-their-restructure-is-over-but-its-too-early-to-start-acquiring-studios-again">grandly announced</a> that they were done throwing studios into the sacrificial volcano, but evidently, there's always room for one more. In late April, Embracer revealed plans to divide their remaining tabletop gaming, free-to-play and premium video game businesses into <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/embracer-will-split-into-three-companies-including-middle-earth-friends">three smaller organisations</a> that are focused on specific markets and platforms and which, crucially, do not have the word "Embracer" in the title - all presided over by the investment firm run by Embracer CEO and cofounder Lars Wingefors.
</p>
<p>
Nu-Alone In The Dark aside, Pieces were the creators of Puzzlegeddon, Fret Nice, Leviathan Warships, Robo Surf and Kill to Collect across PC, console and mobile. They also worked for hire on several Magicka DLCs and Magicka 2, together with Titan Quest expansions Ragnarök and Atlantis. I wasn't that familiar with their work before writing this, sadly, but I will always raise a flagon of goodwill to anybody who's done anything Magicka-related. Here's hoping all those affected by the closure find their feet.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/nintendo-direct-back-half-2024-announced-june/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The June “Not E3” season has almost come to a close, following big shows from <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/summer-game-fest/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Geoff Keighley</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/xbox-games-showcase/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Xbox</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/state-of-play/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PlayStation</a>, and more, but one more straggler still has to show us their wares – Nintendo. Switch owners have been eagerly awaiting a Nintendo showcase of some sort, with <a href="https://wccftech.com/no-nintendo-direct-this-week-journalist-claims-said-to-air-later-this-month/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rumors flying one would be arriving soon</a>, but the company itself has remained mum on the prospect. Well, today Nintendo finally lifted their veil of silence, announcing a <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/nintendo-direct/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nintendo Direct</a> for tomorrow, June 18.</p>
<p>Nintendo has specified that the show will focus on games coming out in the back half of 2024, and will run around 40 minutes long, making it fairly meaty by Nintendo Direct standards. What we won’t see is any information about Nintendo’s successor to the Switch – that’s likely coming later in the year or possibly even in early 2025.</p>
<p><em>“Join us for a Nintendo Direct livestream focused on Nintendo Switch games coming in the second half of 2024! There will be no mention of the Nintendo Switch successor during this presentation.”</em></p>
<p>As for what might be shown during the Nintendo Direct, as always with the company, it’s hard to say, but we can do some educated guessing. It seems quite likely we’ll finally get a first real glimpse of <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/metroid-prime-4/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Metroid Prime 4</a>, as I suspect that will be the Switch’s final big holiday game before Nintendo moves on to new hardware. There have also been various <a href="https://wccftech.com/known-leaker-backs-years-long-zelda-twilight-princess-switch-port-rumor-while-possibly-mentioning-new-zelda/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rumors of Zelda remakes and remasters</a> floating around, and even talk that Star Fox may be coming back in some form.</p>
<p>The Nintendo Direct goes down tomorrow (June 18) at 10am ET. So, excited to see what Nintendo has been cooking up? What do you hope to see? Personally, I would temper expectations somewhat – again, the original Switch only has about half a year still in the spotlight, so there’s only so much they can announce for it. Still, as long as we finally see Metroid Prime 4, I’m happy.</p>

It is inextricable from the series' military fantasy roots. The right men with the right tools at the right place ready to stop evil. To that end, <em>GI Joe Quartermaster's Guide to Gear</em> is a natural sourcebook for the franchise's RPG outing.</p>
<p>This book is a decent supplement given its small page count. It provides new player options and a solid swathe of GM tools, covering larger-scale campaigns. While some of those rules are given more attention than others, the book as a whole is essential if you want to get more out of your games.</p>

<p><em>Gi Joe Quartermaster's Guide to Gear</em> is 127-page <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/essence20-field-guide-to-action-adventure-review">Essence20</a> supplement for the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/gi-joe-roleplaying-game-review"><em>GI Joe Roleplaying Game</em></a>. It contains new player options, including new Origins, Influences, and Role Focuses for both Joe and Cobra PCs. It also contains brand new weapons, weapon upgrades, and vehicles pulled from across the franchise's history.</p>
<p>Lastly, it contains helpful GM rules and resources, including alternate rules for equipment requisition, setting campaigns in different time periods, as well as optional rules for vehicle-focused scenarios.</p>

Now you can upgrade it.</figcaption></figure><h2>What New Equipment Options Are Introduced in<em> GI Joe Quartermaster's Guide to Gear</em>?</h2>
<p>Out of <em>GI Joe Quartermaster's Guide to Gear's</em> five chapters, two of them are completely dedicated to new gear and vehicles.</p>
<p>In keeping with <em>GI Joe'e</em> army aesthetic, these weapons and gear upgrades are a blend&nbsp; of plausible military kit and sci-fi weirdness. There are rules for strobe attachments, ergonomic grips, and concealed weapons for covert ops. Upgrades that sit alongside stats for piezoelectric explosives, molecular reducers/enlargers, and (no, really) the mythical sword Excalibur.</p>
<p>As for defensive options, this supplement introduces a new battledress option: body armor. Functionally, body armor provides temporary health for your character. Given that Essence20 is a low-health system, that extra point of health can mean the difference between victory and defeat.</p>
<p>What makes body armor even better is that it can complement any player loadout. Any PC can take and equip two forms of battledress as long as one is body armor. Better still, body armor has dedicated traits and equipment. Kevlar vests, thick leather jackets, even complex bodysuits made of experimental supermetals are all available.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/gi-joe-quartermasters-guide-to-gear-influence-screenshot.jpg?itok=s7Zrp-nS 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/gi-joe-quartermasters-guide-to-gear-influence-screenshot.jpg?itok=pvEeCe22 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>There is even an influence on going analog. And it is amazing.</figcaption></figure><h2>What New Player Options are in <em>GI Joe Quartermaster's Guide to Gear</em>?</h2>
<p>In keeping with <em>GI Joe Quartermaster's Guide To Gear's</em> emphasis on equipment, the new player options are tech-centric. The Leadfoot Influence gives you bonuses in high-speed vehicle chases. The Futurist Origin provides free equipment for you and your squad and lower high-end gear requisition skill tests. The general perk Destructive Overcharge lets you turn certain weapons and kits into ad-hoc explosives.</p>
<p>But the biggest tech influence comes from the new Role Focuses. The Chameleonite Commando uses nanotech to change their appearance, making them master infiltrators. Drone Pilot Infantry gets a drone that increases utility and power with the player. Tech Officers are experts at coordinating team tactics with on the field tech savvy. Notably, they can treat Driving and Targeting skills as Smarts and Speed Essence skills. Disruptor Rangers are master saboteurs and survivalists, capable of exploiting gaps in enemy battlements. Freebooter Renegades are modern-day pirates and privateers. Highly situational, but devastating on their home turf.</p>
<p>Neutralizer Technicians are battlefield hackers, capable of disrupting important tech and rapidly disassembling complex electronics. Lastly, Strafer Vanguards combine their powerful defensive shields with low-altitude air support.</p>
<p>Generally, if you know your campaign is going for a technothriller vibe, these Role Focuses are a perfect fit.</p>

<p>The <em>GI Joe Roleplaying Game's</em> gear requisition mechanic is a wonderful translation of characters getting ready for a mission. Assessing what will be necessary, planning ahead with some general tools, or requesting something disruptive or explosive just in case. It is James Bond getting gadgets from Q or the <em>Mission Impossible</em> crew planning a heist in TTRPG form.</p>
<p>As it stands in the core rules, it can be limiting for GMs. As exciting as missions and campaigns can be, the system falls into familiar beats. Briefing, exposition, make requisition skill tests, deploy, play out mission. What if players deploy deep behind enemy lines, scrounging for equipment <em>Metal Gear</em>-style? What if players want to upgrade their tools, making their kit an extension of their character?</p>
<p><em>GI Joe Quartermaster's Guide to Gear</em> provides these alternative rules and more. There are rules for swapping out requisition skill tests for a requisition budget, letting players buy gear for a mission. There are rules for equipment requisition by division. Is your character's service background in Demolitions? You automatically get certain weapons, consumables, kits and battledress associated with that skillset.</p>
<p>The most mechanically dense is the <em>Metal Gea</em>r-esque long-term deployment rules. They include charts and skill tests for scavenging and repairing gear based on size and time constraints.</p>
<p>Overall, these new requisition rules are great. They can help either speed up or add extra granularity to certain missions and campaigns as well as limit or expand player options. Want to do a GI Joe take on <em>The Great Escape</em> or <em>A Bridge Too Far</em>? The tools are here.</p>
<p>As for new vehicle combat rules, they are light but effective. These range from accounting for 3D vehicle movement to adjusting battlemap size for vehicle-focused encounters. One of these variant rules I find most creative is Group Specialization Tests. If a team is all manning a vehicle and want to perform a complex maneuver that uses different skills, the driver rolls a D20 and the teammates roll their respective skill dice, treating the entire test as a specialized roll.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/gi-joe-quartermasters-guide-to-gear-historical-period-excerpt.jpg?itok=Ob-JUVC1 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/gi-joe-quartermasters-guide-to-gear-historical-period-excerpt.jpg?itok=9o66AFic 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>History is a great resource for entertainment. This is no different.</figcaption></figure><p>The biggest idea in <em>GI Joe Quartermaster's Guide to Gear</em> is the chapter dedicated to different time periods. Mechanically, it may be the most threadbare section of the book. It discusses historical technological advancement but provides few suggestions for how that tech can be expressed in-game.</p>
<p>The research cited is all compelling, and the book addresses potential changes to the contents of field kits and battledress. Just don't expect transformative charts and rules if you're planning on having the Joes and Cobra duke it out in WW1 or the Cold War.</p>
<p>But if you're a fan of far-future adventures, the supplement has you covered. There are rules and suggestions for cybernetic enhancements and nanomite infusion powers.&nbsp; These range from technoswarms that can disintegrate objects to active combat and defense bonuses. There are even futuristic Threats in the chapter, all of which illustrate how dangerous nanotech can be.</p>

<p>While it is low on pages and uneven with its content, <em>GI Joe Quartermaster's Guide To Gear</em> is a solid supplement. It streamlines and expands some of the game's more complex rules while giving players and GMs plenty of material.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/making-of-original-dungeons-dragons-review-not-history-book-but-museum<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Wizards of the Coast continues to celebrate the 50th anniversary of <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="3579fb91-ffa9-4c99-a750-de9f92ba642f" href="https://techraptor.net/games/dungeons-dragons"><em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em></a> not only with a <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/vecna-eve-of-ruin-dd-5e-review-culmination-of-years-of-work">massive <em>Vecna </em>adventure</a> and upcoming anthology <em>Quests From The Infinite Staircase</em> but also with their monumental <em>Making of Original Dungeons &amp; Dragons 1970-1977</em>.</p>
<p>Written by Jon Peterson - whose previous works include <em>Playing At The World, The Elusive Shift: How Roleplaying Games Forged Their Identity, </em>and <em>Game Wizards</em> - this monumental tome is almost 600 pages of TTRPG history stretching from the wargaming space in the year 1970 all the way up to the release of <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> and it's first few expansions including <em>Greyhawk </em>and <em>Blackmoor</em>.</p>
<p>The tone that Peterson wants to set for this book is set early in his Foreword, "No book published today could hope to give a complete picture of the making of D&amp;D." Peterson cites issues with the 'fragmentary evidence' from its early periods, fanzines that are notoriously difficult to work with, and the very nature of Gygax and Arneson creating a lot of this game in collaboration not only with one another but with their players and being influenced by external resources.</p>

<h2>You Can Start At Anytime</h2>
<p>The story of <em>The Making of Original Dungeons &amp; Dragons 1970-1977</em> begins with Gary Gygax, a "32-year-old high school dropout, married with five children." Working as an insurance underwriter with a passion for wargaming and high fantasy fiction.</p>
<p>At this point in his life, he's already hosted the first Lake Geneva Wargames Convention in Lake Geneva, Wisconsin. This convention is what fans of Board Games and TTRPGs call GenCon.</p>
<p>This book takes us through the journey of Gygax's initial inspirations as well as the different players who were taking different rulesets, iterating on them, or merging them with other games to create all-encompassing systems.</p>
<p>After being taught how Gygax's Fantasy Supplement was adapted to better fit Black Moor, you get to see how Black Moor's updated rules were fed back to Gygax to allow the process to continue to expand.</p>
<h2>Then And Now Aren't So Different</h2>
<p>I was enthralled reading about how 'wild west' the landscape was as systems like <em>Chainmail </em>and <em>Braunstein </em>were getting handwritten updates or fan-made companion rulesets back during the early days of TTRPGs. So many stories are told of different gaming groups or cities having variations on rule sets because they fit the play differently.</p>

<p>It's also impossible not to compare how things were to the current landscape of the TTRPG space, now boosted by the power of the internet.</p>
<p>Gygax submitting supplements about dragons or a homemade <em>Fantasy Supplement</em> to expand on the setting options isn't all that dissimilar to the kinds of zines that indie RPG creators are making or expansions/updates for first-party <em>D&amp;D</em> published content that is sold on websites like DriveThruRPG.</p>

<p>The most impressive aspect of <em>The Making of Original Dungeons &amp; Dragons 1970-1977</em> isn't in the text recounts of events. A lot of these you'll be able to find in any other in-depth history of Dungeons &amp; Dragons. What makes this book so special is that after getting a few paragraphs of text about the <em>Chainmail Fantasy Supplement </em>or the <em>Greyhawk </em>supplement you'll then be provided with scans of the entire document.</p>
<p>Every page you open up to gives the sense of being able to look at a document behind a plexiglass enclosure at what would be a museum of Dungeons &amp; Dragons, while the written text is a bit more akin to the plaque that you'd see on the side.</p>
<p>Examples of the supplements are incredible, but some of the real gems in this book are draft copies of <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> including pages describing the different Cleric levels by experience with Gygax's handwritten notes scratching out previous level names and replacing them with new ones.</p>

<p>These kinds of printouts do take up the majority of the space within the book, the first draft of <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> stretching from page 84 to 182 only to lead directly into a Twin Cities draft as well as the Mornard fragments.</p>
<p>If you are after that narrative history of <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> where a concrete story is woven with edited first and secondhand accounts then this might not be the book for you, but if you want to see the exact documents that were being used to run RPGs fifty years ago or even the handwritten correspondences between Gygax and Arneson this book is a treasure trove.</p>
<p>This 'museum' like approach to providing readers with high-quality scans of all of the documents also lends itself well to a coffee table book approach (even if it's the size of a coffee table) as you can pick it up, flick to any page and learn something new whether you land on information from Peterson himself, or end up inspecting a page highlighting the characteristics of a Reptile in Blackmoor.</p>

<h2><em>The Making Of Original Dungeons &amp; Dragons 1970-1977 </em>Review | Final Thoughts</h2>
<p>Upon first pulling this massive tome out of it's shipping box I was somewhat daunted about all of the information contained within. Once I began reading through it was hard to put it down.</p>
<p>Peterson has done an incredible job not just in providing a timeline and context to the major inspirations and developments that led up to the creation of <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> but has nailed the monumental task of immortalizing high-quality copies of so many different documents.</p>
<p>With letters between Gygax and Arneson, hand-marked drafts of <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em>, and full printouts of completed versions of <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> and its original supplements this book lets any die-hard fan of <em>D&amp;D </em>and TTRPG history keep those pieces for themselves to peruse through at their leisure.</p>
<p>If you're after a history of <em>D&amp;D</em> with a hard narrative throughline you might not get as much out of this resource-dense book, but if you have an interest in viewing the documents as if you were there while history was unfolding then every page of this book will bring you interest.</p>
<p>For the <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> fanatic, this might be the greatest offering of the 50th anniversary celebration.</p>

<h2>Review Summary</h2>
<p>
The Making of Original Dungeons &amp; Dragons contains within it an incredible recounting of the inception and history of Dungeons &amp; Dragons crediting all of those involved while providing hard documents of what it was like to play at the time. This is a must have for D&amp;D history nerds! (<a href="https://techraptor.net/review-score-policy">Review Policy</a>)

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24175496/nintendo-direct-june-date-time-switch<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="MOypv4">Nintendo will broadcast a new Nintendo Direct presentation on Tuesday, June 18, a showcase focused on Switch titles coming in 2024, the company said in a news release on Monday.</p>
<p id="YkTf6D">The Nintendo Direct will run for about 40 minutes and will start at 10 a.m. EDT/7 a.m. PDT. The showcase will stream on Nintendo’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendo">YouTube</a> and <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/nintendo">Twitch</a> channels. Nintendo tempered expectations in its news release: “There will be no mention of the Nintendo Switch successor during this presentation.”</p>
<p id="7woMCO">Nintendo only has a couple of Switch games with confirmed release dates at the moment: <em>Luigi’s Mansion 2 HD </em>and <em>Nintendo World Championships: NES Edition</em>. Of course, the company may have a few surprises in store. Nintendo still has <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24050473/metroid-prime-4-nintendo-switch-2"><em>Metroid Prime 4</em></a> on its schedule, and it’s rumored to be sitting on a handful of remakes and remasters of its past games.</p>
<p id="5Hj38E">Confirmed not to appear during <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24151013/nintendo-switch-2-direct-announcement-teaser">June’s Nintendo Direct is the company’s next console</a>. In May, Nintendo president Shuntaro Furukawa said, “We will be holding a Nintendo Direct this June regarding the Nintendo Switch software lineup for the latter half of 2024, but please be aware that there will be no mention of the Nintendo Switch successor during that presentation.” The company reiterated that message in Monday’s news release — no console news.</p>
<p id="fzew6A">The “<a href="https://www.polygon.com/23633001/nintendo-switch-2-release-date-2024-backward-compatibility">Switch 2</a>” is reportedly <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24075215/nintendo-switch-2-delay-2025-reports">coming sometime in early 2025</a>, and we may not hear official details from Nintendo on that next-gen console until this fall or winter. </p>

Good on Nintendo for keeping expectations in check, but that won’t stop a subset of the internet from being mad when it doesn’t show up. The stream will go live on YouTube <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/live/kX3BkD5PVUM&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/live/kX3BkD5PVUM" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">at this link</a></span>.</p><p>As for what we might see during the show, Nintendo has been pretty quiet about what its 2024 line-up will look like by year’s end. Some theorize this might be because the Switch successor was going to be released this year but has been delayed into 2025, requiring the company to shift its schedules around for the latter half of 2024. In a way that’s refreshing because now we might have a fair bit of surprises, but a lack of specificity always opens these things up for disappointment as people’s expectations get too high. Will <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/metroid-prime-4-samus-aran-nintendo-retro-studios-twitt-1848559323&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/metroid-prime-4-samus-aran-nintendo-retro-studios-twitt-1848559323"><em>Metroid Prime 4</em></a></span><em>, </em>which has been<em> </em>missing in action since its announcement in 2017, finally make an appearance? Get excited for it at your peril. Whatever the case, we’ll get a better sense of the Switch’s twilight year by this time tomorrow.<br></p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>In <a href="https://x.com/NintendoAmerica/status/1802702745276662114" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a new post</a> on X, Nintendo finally confirmed concrete details for the anticipated June Direct showcase, now scheduled for June 18, 2024.</p>



<p>The post reiterates that this livestream will focus on games “coming in the second half of 2024.” It will premiere at 7 AM pacific time, and the event will last “roughly 40 minutes.” </p>



<p>Fans can wait for the event thanks to YouTube’s premiere feature. This sometimes features a revealing description. However, this one only includes the same information as the post. </p>



<figure></figure>



<p>The event description on YouTube also confirms again that “there will be no mention of the Nintendo Switch successor during this presentation.” </p>



<p>Nintendo President Shuntaro Furukawa <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-direct-june-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">previously confirmed</a> this when announcing that the Direct was coming this month. </p>



<p>However, Furukawa has said that Nintendo plans to reveal the Switch successor sometime <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-successor/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">during this fiscal year</a>. Nintendo also confirmed that the next Switch device will not be a completely <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-says-new-switch-console-isnt-a-brand-new-platform/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new type of console</a>.</p>



<p>There is currently no update on the games coming to the Nintendo Direct this June. Fans are already speculating on the potential lineup. </p>



<p>For example, mobile card game Pokémon TCG Pocket was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-announced-for-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmed for 2024</a> last February. However, the next major installment in that franchise is likely reserved for the new Switch device, since Legends Z-A is <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-announced-releasing-worldwide-in-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">coming in 2025</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gameinformer.com/2024/06/17/the-a-quiet-place-game-breaks-its-silence-with-first-reveal-trailer<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Fans of the A Quiet Place films may remember that a video game based on the franchise was <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2021/10/26/a-quiet-place-video-game-announced-for-2022">announced almost three years ago</a>. After years of worrying yet oddly appropriate silence, publisher Saber Interactive has revealed the title and first trailer for A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead.</p>

<p>The first-person adventure is an original story starring a young woman who must trek across a new area of the film’s post-apocalyptic landscape for unknown reasons (though the game’s description mentions she’s dealing with some kind of family drama). Like the movies, keeping quiet to avoid the wrath of the sound-sensitive alien invaders requires using tools such as a customized microphone that measures the sound levels in an area.&nbsp;</p>

<p><iframe allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/91zi75E_SA8" width="640"></iframe></p>

<p>Stealth is key, and players must carefully observe environments to create their own paths while avoiding noise-making hazards such as stepping on broken glass, as seen in the video. The trailer didn’t show any combat, but if it’s anything like the films, guns are likely to be present but perhaps deemphasized (they're quite loud, you see).&nbsp;</p>

<p>Interestingly, A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead seems to have switched developers. When the game was first announced, Illogika was at the helm. Now, the game credits Stormind Games, the team behind the Remothered horror series and, most recently, Batora: Lost Haven.&nbsp;</p>

<p>A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead was originally slated to launch in 2022, the same year <em>A Quiet Place Part II</em> hit theaters. With this trailer arriving ahead of the June 28 premiere of <em>A Quiet Place: Day One</em>, the game is again riding the momentum of a new film release. A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead is coming sometime this year for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.&nbsp;</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/the-final-splatoon-on-wii-u-player-has-dropped-off-ending-a-68-day-streak/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=the-final-splatoon-on-wii-u-player-has-dropped-off-ending-a-68-day-streak<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="408" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Although the shutdown of the Nintendo Network this past April meant people couldn’t play 3DS and Wii U games online anymore, a subset of fans challenged themselves to see how long they could stay connected in specific games until they’re forcibly ejected. As of June 16, that total number has dropped from three to two after the final <em>Splatoon</em> on Wii U player revealed they lost their connection.</p> <p data-characters="407" data-current-count="407" data-injectable="true">In April, Twitter user Lcd101 somehow managed to <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/one-dedicated-splatoon-wii-u-player-is-still-online-even-with-matchmaking-shut-down/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stay online in the first <em>Splatoon</em></a>. They obviously couldn’t play any multiplayer matches since the matchmaking servers were down and there was no one else to play with, but they could still access the in-game shops and view news updates. Their streak had to end eventually, though, and that’s just what happened according to <a href="https://x.com/Lcd101/status/1802122263111581696" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a recent Twitter post</a>.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><div> <blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">This is your Captain speaking. After 68 days online, my connection to Splatoon has been terminated. In my move, I accidentally lost connection to my router.<br>I’d like to thank everyone for this inkredible support. Even though I may be crying now, you’ve kept me going every day. <a href="https://t.co/xlpQogAXIW">pic.twitter.com/xlpQogAXIW</a></p>— Captain Lcd101 (@Lcd101) <a href="https://twitter.com/Lcd101/status/1802122263111581696?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 15, 2024</a></blockquote> </div></figure> <p data-characters="598" data-current-count="898" data-injectable="true">Lcd101 managed to hang on for 68 days until their connection dropped, which is a ridiculously long time. Some may not see the point behind such a feat, but if anyone decides to chronicle <em>Splatoon 1</em>‘s history in the future, Lcd101’s accomplishment is going to get a mention. “Words cannot express how amazing it’s been to wake up every day and see you cheering me on. You’ve made me the luckiest squid (or octo) online and I’m just so thankful for all of your love. I’ve made so many friends over the last two months, friends that I hope to keep forever,” <a href="https://x.com/Lcd101/status/1802122528103756146" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">they wrote</a>.</p>
 <p data-characters="594" data-current-count="594" data-injectable="false">Just last month, <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/one-month-later-and-three-people-are-still-connected-to-the-3ds-and-wii-us-defunct-online-servers/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the final <em>Xenoblade Chronicles X</em> player</a> also lost their online connection, meaning there are only two people left still connected to the Nintendo Network. According to <a href="https://x.com/GaffsNotLaffs/status/1802127720567947332" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Twitter user Gaffs</a>, those players are Fishguy6564 on <em>Mario Kart 7</em> and SlitherySheep on <em>Super Mario Maker</em>. I, for one, am definitely intrigued to see how much longer these two will stay online. Could they make it to the end of June? Maybe all summer? Whatever the case, a very passionate subset of Nintendo fans is hooked on this saga and there will certainly be a sense of melancholy once it comes to a close.</p>

<p data-characters="265" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">We all knew a Nintendo Direct was coming this month. It was just a matter of which day it would take place. Now, with all the hype from Summer Game Fest simmering down, Nintendo’s made its move and confirmed an exact date and time for its own summer showcase.</p> <p data-characters="380" data-current-count="380" data-injectable="false">Said Nintendo Direct will air tomorrow on Tuesday, June 18 at 7am PT / 10am ET / 3pm BST, and is scheduled to run for 40 minutes. Unsurprisingly, Nintendo hasn’t said exactly what sort of games you can expect from the Direct, but it has reaffirmed that there will be no mention of its next console. It <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/nintendo-admits-its-making-a-new-console-in-the-most-casual-way-possible/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">already stressed this last month</a>, but sometimes a reminder is necessary.</p> <figure data-current-count="680" data-injectable="true"></figure>
 <p data-characters="410" data-current-count="410" data-injectable="true">This Direct is expected to cover Nintendo’s plans for the second half of 2024, which are otherwise non-existent. Aside from <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/luigis-mansion-2-hd-announced-for-summer-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Luigi’s Mansion 2 HD</a></em> and <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/nintendo-world-championships-nes-edition-will-let-you-tackle-challenges-in-classic-titles/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nintendo World Championships: NES Edition</a></em> for the summer, Nintendo has no big titles confirmed for the rest of the year. Even without any details about the Switch 2 (or whatever it’s called), Nintendo could also tease its plans for early 2025.</p>
 <p data-characters="487" data-current-count="487" data-injectable="false">There have also been rumours of third-party related announcements for the next Nintendo Direct. A popular one is that we’ll finally see more of the <em>Dragon Quest 3</em> HD-2D remake, and it’s also speculated that the first two games are seeing remakes based on <a href="https://x.com/DragonQuest/status/1794987069531476347" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">this teaser tweet from Square Enix</a>. Earlier today, another rumor spread of <a href="https://x.com/necrolipe/status/1802631710708027771" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">something <em>Ace Attorney</em> related</a> making an appearance, with some theorizing it will be for a collection of the <em>Ace Attorney Investigations</em> duology.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/world-exclusive-first-interview-with-%E2%80%9Cstream-big%E2%80%9D-author-nathan-grayson.903336/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/twitch-stream-big-book-nathan-grayson-interview<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Noted Aftermath co-owner Nathan Grayson, who may or may not have also written this introduction, has written a book. It contains words, pages, a table of contents – the works. It’s called <em>Stream Big: The Triumphs and Turmoils of Twitch and the Stars Behind the Screen</em>, and you can <a href="https://www.simonandschuster.com/books/Stream-Big/Nathan-Grayson/9781982156763" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">preorder it now</a>. In a show of graceful magnanimity, Grayson has granted Aftermath a world-exclusive first interview about the book.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Riley:</strong> Hello, Nathan! Rumor has it you've written a book! First off: what is a book? Aren't we just here to talk about a longer, more expensive blog?</p><p><strong>Nathan: </strong>You ask what a book is, but I want to pose a different question: What <em>isn't </em>a book? What can't a book do? It can travel with you, keep you company in times good and bad, spirit you away to realms previously unimagined. Everyone should buy more books -- and <a href="https://www.simonandschuster.com/books/Stream-Big/Nathan-Grayson/9781982156763" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">mine, specifically</a>.</p><p>In seriousness, though, I thought a lot about this while writing my book – <em>Stream Big: The Triumphs and Turmoils of Twitch and the Stars Behind the Screen</em>, which you can <a href="https://www.simonandschuster.com/books/Stream-Big/Nathan-Grayson/9781982156763" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">preorder NOW</a> -- as I didn't want it to just be a series of glorified articles. My goal was to tell the story of Twitch as a platform, community, and culture through the lens of the people who use it, to take a series of semi-disparate tales and use them to paint a holistic picture. So while each chapter focuses on a specific streamer, major players weave in and out of each others' stories, which are all pivotal moments in their careers (as opposed to the sort of profile piece you often see online about a specific creator, where the main thrust is basically "Person Exists"). In short: It's a book. Please clap.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Riley: </strong>Without giving us so many details that we then don't read the book, which we can do after we <a href="https://www.simonandschuster.com/books/Stream-Big/Nathan-Grayson/9781982156763" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pre-order it TODAY</a>, what is the story of Twitch that you found through writing? What did you learn or come to understand about Twitch through this process?</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> First and foremost, the story of Twitch is the story of its community. The service started out deeply intertwined with its user base -- many of the company's first hires came straight out of livestreaming's primordial soup -- and that's always been its main selling point. The reason livestreaming took off in the first place is because even janky, pre-Twitch attempts could create this instant connection between an individual and their viewers. Chat was a game changer (and in many ways remains one; just look at how Twitch continues to <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2024/05/05/twitch-gaza-protests-streaming/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">transform coverage of major global and political issues</a>). </p><p>Twitch is by no means perfect, but it’s one of the few places online where people go to have actual conversations. That’s the essential spark that makes the whole machine work. This led to many early innovations in what eventually became the creator economy: the idea of spending money to subscribe to a creator you appreciate, the notion that playing video games on camera can be a real job with a schedule, obligations, and even the risk of burnout.</p><figure><blockquote><p>Twitch’s story is also very much a tale of what’s happened to the internet at large. It couldn’t just stay a cool little place for passionate people to gather.</p></blockquote></figure><p>But Twitch’s story is also very much a tale of what’s happened to the internet at large. It couldn’t just stay a cool little place for passionate people to gather. The community became a commodity, one which Amazon ended up purchasing in 2014. The Amazonification of Twitch was relatively slow, but over time, it transformed the site and its priorities. Twitch needed to make money. It took all sorts of stabs at this, many of which did not gel with its users desires and demands. This led to numerous conflicts between Twitch and the community, which – as you saw while, uh, editing my writing – dominated headlines for a handful of years.</p><p>This is not to say Twitch’s early days were perfect. But there was a palpable sense of belief in the platform itself back then. A community member turned (now-former) Twitch employee coined the slogan “bleed purple” around a decade ago. Twitch users and employees used to say it all the time, almost like they were in a cult. Nobody feels that way anymore. Twitch is a corporate vehicle. It, like so much of the rest of the internet, will never be the thing it started out as again.</p><p><strong>Riley: </strong>That sort of raises the question to me of: is Twitch, for lack of a better word, "over"? The early narrative around Twitch of "you could make a living as a streamer" no longer feels as viable as it once was, if it ever was. And through its various transformations over the years, it feels like it's become an institution, with the problems of any institution, plus a whole bunch of unique problems. Maybe this is a perception just shaped by the drama-heavy coverage things on Twitch often get these days, but does Twitch still... matter? Why should I care about the story of how it got where it is?</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> I think it definitely still matters! Despite viewership ebbs and flows -- it definitely peaked in 2020 and 2021 due to the pandemic -- Twitch’s overall numbers remain astronomical. More than that, though, Twitch culture continues to drive the internet at large. Twitch creators say things that reverberate onto YouTube, TikTok, Instagram, etc and shape their cultures as well. On top of that, creators are no longer bound by a single platform. Pretty much everyone is everywhere these days, and many consider Twitch to be an essential tool in their tool belts. It’s possible to stream on the aforementioned other platforms, but nowhere is as optimized for it in terms of features and community as Twitch is. I think the days of Twitch aspiring to reach the same heights as YouTube or what have you have long since passed, but it has carved out a potent niche. Unless Amazon screws things up catastrophically in pursuit of profits over all else – something it could still very much do – that will probably remain the case for some time to come.</p><p><strong>Riley: </strong>Should I read this book if I don't know anything about streaming, or the Twitch stars you write about? Or, if I am, say, my 15-year-old nephew and know everything about these Twitch stars, will this book teach me anything new?</p><p><strong>Nathan: </strong>So I tried to walk an incredibly fine line and write a book for both of the audiences you just described. When I first pitched it to publishers, I positioned it as a book that’d be perfect for Twitch-obsessed young people and parents who desperately wanted to know what the heck a Twitch was. Some time has passed since then, and I think pop culture at large has a better grip on Twitch’s basic mechanics now, but my book always sought to answer a slightly different question: Why do people like Twitch? Why do people <em>care </em>so much about it?</p><p>In pursuit of that, I chose to focus on the people who use Twitch – streamers and viewers – first and foremost, to tell stories that even uninitiated audiences would find relatable. Technology transforms people to a point, but more than that, I think it gives us new lenses through which to view ourselves. Twitch is a place where universal themes – labor, solidarity, celebrity, gossip, drama, achievement, responsibility (or lack thereof) – play out on a daily basis. People are still people whether they’re doing a normal job like working in a grocery store or streaming on Twitch. They have similar wants, needs, motivations, and even dreams. I tried to write something that conveys that.</p><p>That said, I also went super deep into specific streamers’ lives and histories! If you are a big fan of any of the streamers I chose to focus on, you will probably learn something about them that you didn’t already know. I traveled to their homes and places of work, I interviewed their friends, families, fans, critics, and employees, I dug into public records and police documents. There’s a reason why “Behind The Screen” is part of the title: I’m not just recounting what people already saw. There’d be no point in writing a book if that’s all I aimed to accomplish. Twitch is a place where it’s easy to think you see everything – that you truly know your favorite creators. My book aims to authoritatively dispel that notion.</p><figure><blockquote><p>&nbsp;I traveled to their homes and places of work, I interviewed their friends, families, fans, critics, and employees, I dug into public records and police documents. There’s a reason why 'Behind The Screen' is part of the title: I’m not just recounting what people already saw. There’d be no point in writing a book if that’s all I aimed to accomplish.</p></blockquote></figure><p><strong>Riley:</strong> Speaking of all that work, I'm sure every new day brought some new twist that meant you had to revise the book a lot. Was it hard to write a book about this constantly-changing scene, instead of a bunch of articles that can move faster and be updated? How did you decide when to stop?</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> It was VERY HARD. I had to revise certain chapters a ton. If you follow Twitch closely, you can probably guess which ones! Figuring out when to stop was really tough. After a certain point, I kind of had to draw a line in the sand and say, “That’s it. This is where this chapter ends,” because otherwise I could’ve kept revising some of them forever. In most cases, though, I tried to bring things to a close at natural points where the pivotal moments I chose to focus on were tapering off – where both streamers and audiences had either learned a hard lesson or chosen to move on. As I note in the book’s opening, streamers’ lives are messy and complicated; they’ll have likely lived multiple additional chapters by the time my book comes out. But I hope I can at least provide the most complete possible telling of the moments I chose to focus on.</p><p><strong>Riley: </strong>Was it hard to get the people you write about to agree to talk to you for the book? Did your previous work into this space as a journalist help or hinder that at all?</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> It helped a lot! To be honest, it was the only reason I was able to write this book at all. Content creation is not a space that has a good relationship with journalism. Some of this is structural: If you’re a content creator, you get to tell your own story on a daily basis. Why bring in a middleman? But also, journalism around the space – shaped by the SEO content mill era of websites – tends to be sensationalistic at best, ridden with errors and falsehoods at worst. (This is not to discount work done by other very, very good journalists in the field. It's just to say that there are far too few, and they do not get the resources they deserve from their respective publications.)</p><p>I’m fortunate in that I was given time and space at both Kotaku and The Washington Post to develop Twitch into a beat that I took seriously, one with demonstrable utility to streamers: I could translate their experience to mainstream audiences. I was able to help legitimize a field that many so-called Adults refused to take seriously. And it’s one that I think <em>deserves </em>to be taken seriously. Streamers shape the thoughts and viewpoints of millions of people. They build spaces that make some feel, for the first time, like they belong. Some streamers are better at this than others, but regardless, it’s hard work – work that is presided over and, to an extent, exploited by Amazon. Not to get all lefty about it, but the best thing we can do for each other as workers is recognize that we’re all part of the same struggle, that we’re all squeezing blood from the same few stones. I hope people come away from my book with a greater understanding of that.</p><p><strong>Riley: </strong>Is there a story or anecdote in the book we might never have heard before? A world premiere, if you will?</p><p><strong>Nathan: </strong>I go pretty deep into the early days of what would eventually become streaming – when people were homebrewing ramshackle esports casting setups using broadcasting equipment they bought at Best Buy – in a way that’s pretty interesting. I certainly didn’t know about any of that stuff before I started writing the book.</p><p>There are also some pretty gnarly untold stories about both swattings and burnout in there, about the short and long-term impacts those things have on people. Streamers try to keep a lot of that out of the public eye, but they’re still human beings. They are still impacted just like anybody else would be, sometimes on a daily basis.</p><figure><blockquote><p>Preorder now!</p></blockquote></figure><p>I was also in touch with creators through some of their most difficult moments: Amouranth getting out of an abusive relationship, Dream’s community rebelling after he was accused of grooming minors, Code Miko fighting to keep her company from going under, Keffals getting stalked across the world by Kiwi Farms (and later going into rehab for drug addiction). There’s a lot I ended up seeing that others didn’t. Most of it is… rough. I tried to convey it all as sensitively as possible.</p><p><strong>Riley:</strong> Lastly, we beat the drum a lot about not pre-ordering video games, but it's a pretty different situation in publishing. Why should we <a href="https://www.simonandschuster.com/books/Stream-Big/Nathan-Grayson/9781982156763" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pre-order the book</a>?</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> I’m a first-time author, but as I understand it, books live and die by preorders. Preorders teach the Amazon algorithm to prioritize specific books, and even though my book is very critical of Amazon, I, as an author, am to a degree reliant on it. Preorders also signal to the publisher that the book could be a Big Deal, which means they’ll devote more resources to selling and promoting it. Resulting buzz can then lead to larger orders from retailers, which is obviously a good thing. Also, more broadly, preorders are often counted as sales, meaning that if you get a bunch of preorders ahead of release, your book then looks like it’s selling incredibly well – and potentially charting – during its first week. Ideally, that leads to continued sales, hopefully forever. Basically, the whole thing is a chain reaction that starts now.</p><p>If we’re drawing a specific comparison to video games, what you see before a game comes out is not always what you get. Games change dramatically during development, and publishers don’t do a great job of cluing prospective buyers into that process. My book is done! Unless something absolutely bonkers happens to one of the streamers featured in it, there will be no need for additional revisions prior to release. It is what it is! It’s good, I promise! <a href="https://www.simonandschuster.com/books/Stream-Big/Nathan-Grayson/9781982156763" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Preorder now</a>!

		<p>Saber Interactive and developer Stormind Games have revealed A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead, a quiet and sneaky horror game that’s set to release for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/playstation-5">PlayStation 5</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/xbox-series-x">Xbox Series X|S</a> and PC later this year.</p>
<p><iframe title="A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead - Reveal Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/91zi75E_SA8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>As you can get a feel of from the trailer, every moment in A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead will be about trying to survive and navigate the world while staying as quiet as possible. You’ll also note the need to use an asthma pump and a handheld noise meter. Of course, this is animated as opposed to gameplay, but it’s indicative of the elements you’ll need to juggle. The game will follow an original story, casting players as a young women struggling to evade the nightmare monsters, as well as overcoming family conflicts and inner fears in this spin-off from the popular film franchise.</p>
<p>Speaking of which, this reveal has come at the exact right time, just a week or so ahead of the theatrical release of A Quiet Place: Day One.</p>


<p>A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead is in development by Stormind Games, who are best known for the psychological horror <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/10/19/remothered-broken-porcelain-review/">Remothered: Broken Porcelain</a> and Tormented Fathers, as well as action RPG Batora: Lost Haven. From the trailer, this would be a big step up for the studio, but they’re leaning into the right ideas and tropes that will fit well with a video game – here’s hoping for some Alien: Isolation vibes.</p>
<p>What’s not immediately is how this relates to the A Quiet Place game that was <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/10/27/a-quiet-place-video-game-2022-trailer/">first confirmed to be in development back in 2021</a>. That game was also to be published by Saber, but had developers iLLOGIKA and EP1T0ME attached. Certainly Saber has held onto the video game license while being <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/03/14/embracer-has-officially-sold-off-saber-interactive/">sold off by Embracer</a>, but this game is from a different developer. We’ve asked for clarity on this point.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/quiet-place-road-ahead-2024<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Saber Interactive and developer Stormind have announced&nbsp;<em>A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead</em>, a game based on the popular movie franchise. It's launching later this year.</p>
<p>As you can probably imagine if you've seen the movies,&nbsp;<em>The Road Ahead&nbsp;</em>will task you with sneaking through a variety of environments while trying not to make any noise.</p>
<p>The story told here will be entirely new, so you won't be retreading the events of either of the already-released movie installments, nor will you be playing an adaptation of the upcoming prequel&nbsp;<em>Day One</em>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/a-quiet-place-the-road-ahead-monster.jpg?itok=qsI48I5i 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/a-quiet-place-the-road-ahead-monster.jpg?itok=PluGyxh6 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Ever wondered how you'd do against the monsters of&nbsp;<em>A Quiet Place</em>? Well, wonder no more.</figcaption></figure><p>Naturally, since the monsters of&nbsp;<em>A Quiet Place&nbsp;</em>aren't exactly known for being pushovers, it doesn't sound like you'll be able to engage in any form of combat in Stormind's game.</p>
<p>Rather, you'll be sneaking around each environment, scavenging for tools and distracting the monsters to help you pass by unnoticed. If you're a fan of games like&nbsp;<em>Outlast</em>, then you'll know what kind of ballpark you're in here.</p>
<p>You can check out the reveal trailer for&nbsp;<em>A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead&nbsp;</em>right here. It gives a sense of what kind of journey you're in for. Suffice it to say that if you're looking for&nbsp;<em>Resident Evil&nbsp;</em>or&nbsp;<em>Dead Space</em>-style action horror shenanigans, you ain't gonna find them here.</p>

<p>Developer Stormind Games has a history with horror. Although the studio's most recent game is 2022's&nbsp;<em>Batora: Lost Haven</em>, it's also known for psychological horror jaunts&nbsp;<em>Remothered: Tormented Fathers&nbsp;</em>and its followup&nbsp;<i>Broken Porcelain</i>.</p>
<p><em>Tormented Fathers&nbsp;</em>met with <a href="https://opencritic.com/game/5495/remothered-tormented-fathers" rel="noopener" target="_blank">broadly positive reviews</a> on its release back in 2018, but&nbsp;<em>Broken Porcelain</em>'s reception was <a href="https://opencritic.com/game/10349/remothered-broken-porcelain" rel="noopener" target="_blank">decidedly more frosty</a> a couple of years later. Our own reviewer rather <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/remothered-tormented-fathers-review-twisted-experience">enjoyed</a> both <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/remothered-broken-porcelain-review">games</a>, though.</p>
<p>At any rate,&nbsp;<em>A Quiet Place: The Road Ahead&nbsp;</em>launches for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2233120/A_Quiet_Place_The_Road_Ahead/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-gb/concept/10009366/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/games/store/a-quiet-place-the-road-ahead/9NZLPG7P5KSS" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a> sometime this year.

    <div>
        

        <p>And why early access was so important.</p>

Baldur's Gate 3 will receive <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-patch-7-adds-official-modding-toolkit-this-autumn">official mod support in a forthcoming patch</a>, which Larian CEO Swen Vincke said will be a handover moment to players.

</p>
<p>
Speaking at BAFTA's An Evening with Baldur's Gate 3 after the game received multiple wins at this year's awards, Vincke discussed development of the game and Larian's long term support.
</p>
<p>
"One of the big things for us, and the one that we're really working towards now, is the ability for players to mod [Baldur's Gate 3] themselves, because then they will be able to make their own things," said Vincke. "And I think that will be the point where we're going to say 'ok, now it's yours fully'."

</figure>
<p>
He admitted the team hasn't finished development of mod support yet and that it's been "hard trying to make that work". The release of the update, though, won't mark the end of support entirely, but "you will see the level of support diminished to really critical bug fixes" and for now "we're still working as if the game was just out".
</p>
<p>
When asked if he was looking forward to this "final handover moment", Vincke replied with an emphatic "yes". 
</p>
<p>
"We're working on our new thing, we're super excited about the new games," he continued. "We're creative spirits also, we don't want to keep on doing the same thing, we really want to move forward and do new things."
</p>
<p>
We know already it's likely <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-developers-next-game-likely-early-access-launch-too">Larian's next game will also be released in early access</a>, as director of publishing Michael Douse previously stated.

</p>
<p>
Vincke spoke further at BAFTA about the importance of early access for Baldur's Gate 3's development.
</p>
<p>
"The biggest thing that came out was it allowed us to course correct," said Vincke. "There were mistakes that we were making and the players were telling us 'this is a mistake, you shouldn't be doing this'.
</p>
<p>
"We try to listen and do as much as we can, where we think it makes a lot of sense. So that I think was instrumental in BG3's success."
</p>
<figure>
<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/SA902342.png?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">
 </a>
<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>BAFTA/Dan Fearon</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
But how do developers know what feedback is actually useful? "A lot of it is on gut feeling," said Vincke, admitting some elements can be analysed through data. "At the end of the day it's really how do I feel like a player about the game. I think if you do it any other way, you will just be paralysed, you won't be able to do anything. If you're going to try to do it by committee, then it's just going to be the most mediocre things that you can have. You have to follow your gut and say 'what game do you want to play?' And then it actually comes very easy, you just have to hope that that's the game that other people want to play also."
</p>
<p>
He added: "You also have to take into account there are many, many people in the universe with many many opinions. So it's impossible to cater to everyone. You don't necessarily always have to listen to the majority if you really believe in what's inside of the game."
</p>
<p>
So is early access the future of game development? At the least, Vincke said he would "heartily recommend it", but admitted four years of early access was "actually quite long" as players can get tired over that time. 
</p>
<p>
He continued: "You really shouldn't approach it with the attitude 'oh it's just early access'. There are players playing this that care. So you should treat them with respect."
</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-takes-home-best-game-and-four-more-awards-at-this-years-baftas">Baldur's Gate 3 won five awards at this year's BAFTAs</a>, including Best Game. A recording of An Evening with Baldur's Gate 3 will soon be up on the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/@bafta">BAFTA YouTube channel</a>.

</p>
<p>

            <p>Fallout has seen a renewed spike in popularity following the release of Amazon's TV adaptation. However, despite this, Bethesda doesn't feel under pressure to rush a new game out to placate fans.</p>
<p>Speaking with YouTuber MrMattyPlays, Todd Howard acknowledged that the Fallout series is probably at its most popular, with the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/todd-howard-says-fallout-renaissance-is-beyond-anything-hes-seen-in-his-career">franchise boasting some record player numbers over recent months</a>. Howard went on to state the studio gives "a lot of thought to franchise management" when questioned specifically about the future of Fallout as a whole.</p>
<p>"I spend a lot of time thinking about franchises I love... so, for us, it is sort of game planning out - number one, making sure Fallout is relevant in the world, and well, I think, clearly it is," the studio exec said. </p>

<p>"People are hungry for even more. We've never stopped doing Fallout work. A lot of that work goes on, obviously, in Fallout 76." At this point, he mentioned its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-76s-skyline-valley-update-strikes-right-at-the-heart-of-what-you-love-about-single-player-fallout">new Skyline Valley update</a>, saying the team is "really excited with where that game is at".</p>
<p>But, what about other Fallout games in the future? "Obviously, I can't talk about those right now," Howard said. "But, I would say rushing through them or 'we need to get stuff out that is different than the work we're doing in 76', you know, we don't feel like we need to rush any of that."</p>
<p>Howard believes Amazon's Fallout TV show fills a gap for the series' fanbase "in terms of the franchise and storytelling". He said he still understands the community's "desire for a new mainline single-player game", but noted "those things take time".</p>
<p>Said Howard: "I don't think it's bad for people to miss things, as well... we just want to get it right and make sure that everything we're doing in a franchise - whether it's Elder Scrolls or Fallout or now Starfield - that those become meaningful moments for everybody who loves these franchises as much as we do."</p> <div>

<p>The developer said his preference is often to hold things back for as long as possible, saying his "perfect scenario for games" is to "announce them and get them out as quickly as possible" - a point he has made before.</p>
<p>This is in contrast to the studio's Elder Scrolls 6 reveal in 2018. However, according to Skyrim's lead designer Bruce Nesmith, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elder-scrolls-6-revealed-so-early-due-to-pitchforks-and-torches">Elder Scrolls 6 was only announced when it was because "the pitchforks and torches were out"</a>. Meanwhile, last year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/todd-howard-wishes-hed-been-a-bit-more-casual-with-his-elder-scrolls-6-announcement">Howard admitted he wishes he had announced The Elder Scrolls 6 differently</a>.</p>
<p>"I probably would've announced it more casually" today, Howard said in August, admitting he had "asked [himself] a lot" if he regrets revealing the game when he did.</p>
<p>That being said, The Elder Scrolls 6 still looks to be Bethesda's next big RPG release. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/todd-howard-confirms-fallout-5-will-be-bethesdas-next-game-after-elder-scrolls-6">Fallout 5 is also confirmed</a>, but won't arrive until afterwards.</p>
<p>Elsewhere in his conversation with MrMattyPlays, Howard confirmed that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bethesdas-todd-howard-confirms-at-least-one-more-starfield-expansion-after-shattered-space">Starfield will be getting at least one more expansion after Shattered Space</a> releases later this year.</p>
