		<p>REPO has given been one final development update before the year is up, and developer Semiwork has listened to the feedback of what a lot of players wanted. Yes, players will be able use a walkie talkie to communicate when the next REPO update is released. Additionally, there will also be a leaf blower so you can blow away enemies and allies alike.</p>
<p><iframe title="BIG NEW THINGS coming to R.E.P.O." width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wozEOeJlICY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The walkie talkie and leaf blower will not be the only things coming to REPO in its next update. Semiwork has confirmed that it will be overhauling the in game shop with a new visual design and new features including an Upgrade Re-Roller that lets you re-roll upgrades for a fee. The team is also working on improving vehicles and making them more intuitive to use across the maps. One of the changes will include adding drifting to the semiscooter. There was also confirmation that Semiwork is targeting 2026 to release REPO into version 1.0.</p>
<p>R.E.P.O stands for The Retrieve, Extract &amp; Profit Operation, where players look for valuable items from a variety of locations while trying to avoid the monsters that lurk in these areas. These valuables could be lightweight items all the way up to grand pianos, so players need to work together to get in, get the items out, and survive. R.E.P.O entered early access in February and since then has built up a large following and overwhelmingly positive reviews on Steam.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Variety is, as they say, the spice of life, and 2025 provided a fantastic array of different video games. We’ve survived and extracted from the robot-ruled battlefields of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/arc-raiders">Arc Raiders</a>, adventured across the medieval lands of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii">Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2</a>, and established mind-expanding exhibitions in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/two-point-museum-review">Two Point Museum</a>. We helped <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/keeper">Keeper</a>’s sentient lighthouse solve puzzles, and unearthed the secrets buried in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/atomfall">Atomfall</a>’s eerie England. But which of the year’s many different video games is worthy of being crowned the very best of 2025? </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Every December, the IGN team considers all the games they’ve collectively played and reviewed across the year, and votes on which one they think is the greatest of them all. Which one is the “Game of the Year”? Sometimes that choice is incredibly difficult. Other years, it’s easy. 2025 was the latter, with our winner securing almost three-quarters of the vote. But what is that near-universally admired game? That’s what we’re here to reveal.   </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The Best Game of 2025</h3></div></output><h2 data-cy="title2">Honorable Mentions</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Before we run down the games that made it onto our final shortlist, we’d like to recognise several other brilliant experiences that we’ve had this year. Hazelight Studios once again proved that it's the king of co-op with the wonderful <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/split-fiction">Split Fiction</a>, a creative action platformer that builds atop the successes of 2021’s It Takes Two with some of the most surprising and innovative level design that we’ve seen not just this year, but this decade. There was some interesting innovation happening over at Konami, too. With <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/silent-hill-f">Silent Hill f</a>, developer NeoBards Entertainment took the series’ trademark oppressive horror and blended it with a novel approach to new game plus to create a remarkable story that deepens with each replay. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Talking of replays, that’s the name of the game for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/ball-x-pit">Ball x Pit</a>, the brick-breaking roguelike from Kenny Sun and Devolver Digital, whose furious action had us coming back for one more run time and time again. So long as our time wasn’t being stolen by <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/fantasy-life-i-the-girl-who-steals-time">Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time</a>, of course – Level-5’s smart blend of Animal Crossing’s cosy slice-of-life and The Legend of Zelda’s dungeon diving turned out to be a real comfort game for us this year. The same could be said for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/ghost-of-yotei">Ghost of Yotei</a>, too, which rekindled happy memories of 2020’s Ghost of Tsushima, but boosted all of that game’s good ideas with even deeper mechanics and more striking landscapes. It’s safe to say that 2025 was pretty good for games, and we’ve not even discussed the very best of them, yet. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Runner-Up - Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/08/best-game-of-2025-death-stranding-2-1765184626390.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Exactly half of our shortlist for the Best Game of 2025 is made up of sequels that faced tough challenges. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach">Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</a> arguably faced the most difficult one: how to turn a divisive “walking sim” into something more universally beloved, without betraying its core, admittedly niche values? The answer, perhaps unsurprisingly for a Kojima Productions project, was to look back to Metal Gear Solid and incorporate the freedom of The Phantom Pain into this open-world delivery simulator. A constantly rolling conveyor belt of gear, from ladders and boots to coffin hoverboards and weaponised electric guitars, ensures you always have the tools to tackle Death Stranding 2’s missions on your own terms. While this is still a game fundamentally about transporting items from location A to location B, no two deliveries feel the same. An ever-evolving and adapting world sees journeys that once unfolded on foot upgraded to make use of roads, ziplines, and eventually monorails, with destinations pursued either via your own pathways or by making use of creative solutions designed by other players. Such a journey isn’t purely physical, either; as you travel, your growing team supports you through an emotional ordeal that ponders the value of human connection. All this ensures that On the Beach finally fulfills the unique promise of the original Death Stranding. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Runner-Up - Hades 2</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/08/best-game-hades-2-1765184663988.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">The creative juggernaut that is Supergiant Games likely could have simply recreated its 2020 roguelike hit, Hades, with just a few mechanical upgrades and still received critical acclaim. And, on the surface, that’s what <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/hades-ii">Hades 2</a> appears to be. It takes just a single scratch to reveal the truth about this incredibly ambitious sequel, though, which smartly rethinks and remixes many of its predecessor’s fundamentals. Yes, this is still a game in which you battle as far as you can through the branching routes of a dungeon until death forces you to start all over again, but new protagonist Melinoë’s quest to kill Chronos, the Titan of Time, takes place along two opposing routes. Every run starts with a choice: ascend Mount Olympus, or descend into Tartarus. Each location provides entirely different bosses, biomes, storylines, and challenges, which solves the age-old roguelike issue of grinding repetition. Stuck on a formidable boss? There’s an entire other world to conquer instead. And conquer you will, armed with the most refined set of skills and upgrades the genre has seen. This is a buildcrafter's dream, even in spite of the random nature of your God-given boons, and each run is an opportunity to mold Mel into a brand new kind of magic weapon. With unrivaled art and music, and one of the tightest combat systems around, Hades 2 is a spectacular triumph.  </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Runner-Up - Hollow Knight: Silksong</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/08/best-game-hollow-knight-silksong-1765184646367.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">The eight-year wait for Hollow Knight’s sequel did the expectations around Silksong no favours. This wasn’t just one of the most anticipated indie projects of all time – many major series with decades of history would envy this kind of attention. Some would say it’s nothing short of a miracle that Silksong met (and arguably exceeded) those expectations, but the reality is anchored in creative talent, clear vision, and exceptional art. This is one of the most beautifully drawn video games of the generation, packed with haunting caverns, overgrown dungeons, and myriad more unmissable vistas. Such regions are not just pretty, but precision-engineered to provide some of the best platforming challenges this side of Celeste and Super Meat Boy. And at the heart of each level are the exhilarating boss fights that are partially responsible for Silksong’s fiendish reputation. Yes, this is an unapologetically challenging adventure that stings as fiercely as any of its insectoid characters. But it never strikes unfairly, and its elegant Metroidvania map always offers an alternative route, should a foe prove too imposing. In a world where difficult games have perhaps become something of an oversubscribed format, the idea of a challenge being truly worth the pain has perhaps worn a little thin. But in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/hollow-knight-silksong">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a>, developer Team Cherry really has crafted a treasure worth fighting for.     </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Runner-Up - Blue Prince</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/08/best-game-blue-prince-1765184557780.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">The roguelite is nothing if not an incredibly malleable genre. You can make an action RPG roguelite, a shooter roguelite, a card game roguelite, even a puzzle roguelite – although that latter one is certainly rarer than the others. Joining that small roster of looping head-scratchers is Dogubomb’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/blue-prince">Blue Prince</a>, an elegantly crafted labyrinth in which the corridors are all of your choosing. Every new run is, fundamentally, an attempt to find a mysterious hidden room within a sprawling mansion where every new chamber you enter is chosen from a random selection of blueprints. But that overall goal is ultimately less important than the many secrets that await in every fresh attempt – room combinations that unlock clues to further mysteries, and breathtaking discoveries that deepen the house’s story. Its random nature is the initial obstacle, as building rooms in the correct order is all but impossible when you don’t know which blueprints you’ll be dealt. But soon you realise that the real challenge is in logic, pattern, and connections. And when you finally see the fine lines that link its many ideas together, it instantly becomes clear how immaculately constructed Blue Prince is.   </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Runner-Up - Donkey Kong Bananza</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/08/best-game-of-2025-donkey-kong-bananza-1765184602875.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">When Nintendo launched the original Switch, it did so with the open world-redefining Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild. And so with Switch 2, the pressure was on to craft yet another ground-breaking launch window game. Nintendo took on that mission quite literally with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a>, in which your core interaction with the world is to shatter it into tiny chunks. We’ve had games with destructible environments before, but there’s nothing quite like Bananza’s complete demolition of its levels, which somehow still manage to maintain their Mario-grade craftsmanship even after having been pummeled to pieces. That terrain is filled with buried collectables, and excavating them often requires the completion of clever challenges that feel satisfying to solve every single time. The banana on top of this platforming delight, though, is the duo of DK and Pauline, whose pairing is not only charming, but also mechanically powerful: the titular Bananzas, activated via catchy songs, turn you into unstoppable brawling machines that can easily defeat monkey, monster, and mountain. It’s perhaps Nintendo’s best-ever power trip.   </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Winner - Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/08/best-game-of-2025-clair-obscur-1765184681173.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">There’s something undeniably nostalgic about <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/clair-obscur-expedition-33">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a>. Its turn-based battles, party-driven story, and linear exploration are distinctly old-school in nature, and undeniably indebted to the RPG greats of yesteryear. There’s perhaps no other game out there that wears its love for Final Fantasy as proudly as Expedition 33 does. But with its debut game, Sandfall Interactive has done more than pay homage to the past – it has demonstrated a scholarly understanding of why those games succeeded, and how their ideas can be revitalised. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Within the framework of a traditional, Japanese-style role-playing game, the young studio has created a distinctly modern take on the genre. Breathtaking combat encounters demand both split-second, real-time reactions and careful turn-by-turn tactical planning. Daunting bosses are overcome by smart (and sometimes enjoyably exploitative) use of a deep perks system that empowers you to transform your band of adventurers into a battalion of unstoppable heroes. And the archetypes used for each party member, from elegant fencers to destructive mages, are defined not just by weapons, but by bespoke battle mechanics that ensure each character feels like a distinct, unique personality.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Sandfall’s artistry is not limited to its impressive combat systems, though. Clair Obscur transports you to a breathtaking world where every sight and sound feels genuinely fresh. Its distinctly French, Belle Époque-influenced art style is unlike anything in the genre, as is its incredible music, composed by Lorien Testard, which is destined to play alongside Nobuo Uematsu’s best work in the video game concerts of the future. But it’s Expedition 33’s deeply affecting, emotionally resonating story – and the powerfully drawn characters who live and suffer through it – that leaves the greatest mark. In a world where a deity extinguishes swathes of ever-younger people on an annual basis, what does it mean to survive, grieve, and, ultimately, continue on? The answers to those questions changed not just Clair Obscur’s characters, but its players, too. This is without a doubt the year’s most talked-about game, and it comes as no surprise that it didn’t just win IGN’s end-of-year vote, but stole it by a landslide.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 is IGN’s Best Game of 2025. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Congratulations to Sandfall Interactive, and also to all of the studios whose games were nominated and recognised as part of our end-of-year awards. Did we choose your favourites, or do you think we missed a worthy winner? Let us know in the comments, and be sure to check out our full list of awards to see who else we honored in our round-up of the very best of games, movies, TV shows, and more from across the year. But for now, we hope you had a brilliant time with the fantastic games of 2025, and we’ll catch you for even more in 2026.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Matt Purslow is IGN's Executive Editor of Features. </em></p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/the-best-game-of-2025]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">"Please picture this while playing Age of Imprisonment, and look forward to our new Zelda game."</h2></div><div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Eiji Aonuma, the producer of The Legend of Zelda series, recently dropped some hints about what players can expect from the next game in the series in an interview with Japanese news site <a href="https://www.4gamer.net/games/898/G089833/20251205029/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">4Gamer</a>. He noted that the collaboration with Koei Tecmo on Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment may influence the next mainline Legend of Zelda title.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While the Wii got Twilight Princess and the Switch got Breath of the Wild as launch titles, there has yet to be any announcement about an upcoming mainline Zelda game for the Switch 2. However, owners of Nintendo’s latest console do have Hyrule Warriors: The Age of Imprisonment to play. Age of Imprisonment is the latest entry in a spin-off series that combines Dynasty Warriors-style 1 vs. 1000 <em>musou</em> gameplay with the characters, lore, and locales of The Legend of Zelda. It allows players to experience the Imprisoning War that sealed away the Demon King Ganondorf. Like previous Hyrule Warriors games, Age of Imprisonment was a collaboration between Koei Tecmo and Nintendo, with Koei Tecmo and its new AAA Games Studio handling the development.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Zelda series producer Aonuma said that his team wanted to be the first to release a new Zelda title on the Switch 2, however Koei Tecmo beat them to it. “The Legend of Zelda: Age of Imprisonment is the first Zelda title released for the Nintendo Switch 2. To be honest, we wanted to bring out the ‘first’ (Zelda game on the new console),” he laughed.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Commenting on the collaboration with Koei Tecmo on Age of Imprisonment, Hidemaro Fujibayashi (director of Tears of the Kingdom and Breath of the Wild) said: “it was incredibly fun. They always had ideas we never would have come up with on our own, it was truly stimulating.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In turn, Age of Imprisonment’s director Koki Aoyanagi talked about how motivating it was to receive such positive reactions from the Nintendo team, saying: "since they (the Nintendo team) were playtesting the game, we wanted to give them big surprises and moments of awe to experience." Age of Imprisonment producer Ryota Matsushita described the Zelda team and Koei Tecmo’s team as being “on the same wavelength” when it came to collaborating on the game, noting that Fujibayashi’s knowledge of real-life castles enabled them to instantly understand each other regarding how Hyrule Castle should be depicted in Age of Imprisonment.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The 10 Best Legend of Zelda Games</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“We aimed to combine these two approaches; the Zelda-like, strategic back-and-forth of using Zonai gear and varied techniques against powerful foes with the exhilaration of <em>musou </em>(i.e. feeling mighty powerful as you cut down waves of weaker foes),” noted AAA Games Studio head Yusuke Hayashi. Even when Nintendo’s Zelda team gave feedback on points of concern, Fujibayashi said that Koei Tecmo would come back with “proposals that elevated it into something even better.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Aonuma even suggests that this fruitful collaboration might influence the next mainline Zelda title. “The inspiration we received from this collaboration with Koei Tecmo may be reflected in the (next) Zelda we create. Please picture this while playing Age of Imprisonment, and look forward to our Zelda.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Aonuma’s comment is mysterious, but this means that we might get elements from Age of Imprisonment’s gameplay in the next mainline Zelda adventure.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In September 2023, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-moves-on-to-brand-new-the-legend-of-zelda-game-rules-out-tears-of-the-kingdom-dlc">Nintendo said it had no plans to release DLC for The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, and was instead moving on to a brand new game in the series</a>. However, Aonuma failed to rule out a return to the Hyrule of Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom, potentially setting up a third game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“In the first place, the reason I decided to make this a sequel to the previous work was because I thought there was value in experiencing a new game in that Hyrule place,” Aonuma said. “If that's the case, if a new reason arises, we might return to the same world again. Whether it's a sequel or a new work, I think it's going to be a completely new game, so I hope you're looking forward to it.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Director Hidemaro Fujibayashi also chimed in with his own comment: “We are very grateful that so many customers have been playing Tears of the Kingdom for so long and deeply, so we will do our best to make the next game even more enjoyable.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Verity Townsend is a Japan-based freelance writer who previously served as editor, contributor and translator for the game news site Automaton West.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">That must be a good sign, right?</h2></p><div><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 launched last month to become the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/video-game-physical-software-and-hardware-sales-just-had-the-worst-november-in-the-us-since-1995">best-selling game of November</a> in the U.S. by dollar sales. That's a pretty good showing, right? </p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you're still looking to pick up the new game, it's down to <a href="https://zdcs.link/Qxx8LY?object_uuid=9aac5ef4-52f1-4d92-9740-ce414355322a&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">$35 at Best Buy for one day only</a>, and around <a href="https://zdcs.link/aN8YbG?object_uuid=9aac5ef4-52f1-4d92-9740-ce414355322a&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">$40 at most other retailers right now</a>. That's up to 50% off the game, only a month after release, on PS5, PS4, and Xbox consoles.</p><div catalogid="ecaa092a-71dd-486c-ba96-8299c569c08e" id="227107"><div id="227107" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">So what's up, and why is one of the best-selling games of the year already so heavily discounted? Well, it doesn't take a genius to realise that Black Ops 7 doesn't seem to be doing as well as last year's Black Ops 6.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That's reflected in everything from the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-campaign-review">critical review scores</a> to fan response to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-suffers-terrible-launch-in-europe-with-63-fewer-copies-sold-than-battlefield-6-but-theres-important-context-to-consider">European sales figures</a>, and even <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-will-no-longer-do-back-to-back-releases-of-modern-warfare-or-black-ops-games">Activision's own admissions</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Normally, the newest Call of Duty topping the yearly charts is basically a given. This year, though, the surprise is that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-6-now-extremely-likely-to-beat-call-of-duty-black-ops-7-as-the-best-selling-game-of-2025-in-the-us">Battlefield 6 looks set to claim the top spot in the US instead</a>. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">That is not entirely unprecedented. In 2023, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hogwarts-legacy-beats-modern-warfare-3-as-best-selling-game-of-2023-in-the-us">Hogwarts Legacy outsold Modern Warfare 3</a>, and it managed that without MW3 launching into Game Pass.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Still, Call of Duty bounced straight back in 2024, and before that only Rockstar heavyweights like GTA 5 and Red Dead Redemption 2 had managed to knock it off the annual top spot, stretching all the way back to Rock Band in 2008.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Viewed in that context, it is hardly shocking that Activision is reportedly rethinking how it plans and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-will-no-longer-do-back-to-back-releases-of-modern-warfare-or-black-ops-games">releases Call of Duty year to year</a>, or that it is already leaning on aggressive discounts not long after one of its biggest games hit shelves.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Robert Anderson is Senior Commerce Editor and IGN's resident deals expert on games, collectibles, trading card games, and more.

            <guid>1388488</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Total War: Warhammer 40,000 will launch with four factions: Space Marines; Orks; Astra Militarum; and the Aeldari. But based on comments from developer Creative Assembly, it will eventually come to include pretty much every faction in the setting, added over the course of years.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Creative Assembly announced Total War: Warhammer 40,000 at The Game Awards with a flashy trailer that combined CG and in-engine gameplay, showing off the scale of the hotly anticipated strategy game. We saw the Space Marines faction fighting against the Orks in a classic boots on the ground matchup, before the camera pulled back to reveal the galactic strategy layer you’ll be able to manage campaigns on.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But the Sega-owned developer, which is based in Horsham in the UK, has a grand plan to add many more factions to Total War: Warhammer 40,000 as part of a vision that may take a decade to realize.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In a <a href="https://community.creative-assembly.com/total-war/total-war/blogs/92-total-war-thank-you-for-your-support-in-2025" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">year-ending thank you post</a> to the developer’s fans, Roger Collum, VP of Total War, said Creative Assembly’s goal is to create “the ultimate game set in the Warhammer 40,000 universe,” one that will see “all your favorites from the setting eventually coexist with a vast galactic sandbox.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Some of you have already pointed out that this is what the next 10 years looks like for CA,” Collum continued. “It’s going to take quite a bit of time to get everything in the massive 40k catalogue that deserves a place in the galaxy.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That’s an exciting proposition of fans of Warhammer 40,000, which is packed with factions to choose from. Some of the more high-profile factions currently not announced to be in Total War: Warhammer 40,000 include the Necrons, the Tyranids, the Adeptus Mechanicus (tech-priests of Mars), and Chaos Space Marines (come on Death Guard!). But there are many more on top of those to consider, such as the Tau, Genestealer Cults, the Drukhari (Dark Eldar), and Adepta Sororitas (Sisters of Battle). The list goes on.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Total War: Warhammer 40,000 Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Total War: Warhammer 40,000 doesn’t yet have a release date, so putting a year on when these factions may turn up in-game is impossible. But it sounds like Creative Assembly is here for the long run, as it has been with its Total War: Warhammer games, which began in 2016 and is still seeing updates for Total War: Warhammer 3. It stands to reason that Creative Assembly will look to employ a similar model for Total War: Warhammer 40,000, which means fans can reasonably expect most of the setting’s factions to get some time in the sun, perhaps via the release of Total War: Warhammer 40,000 2 and 3 (that’s a lot of numbers, though!).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are few Total War: Warhammer 40,000 details that have emerged in the wake of the game’s announcement worth pointing out here. In a follow-up developer roundtable video, Creative Assembly confirmed you’ll be able to blow up a planet in the game, although described this as a last resort. In-universe, this is called Exterminatus, and can only be done with the go-ahead from the highest authorities within the Imperium of Man. Sometimes, there really isn’t any other option in the grim darkness of the far future.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And the level of faction customization really does look impressive. Clearly, this isn’t a game about forcing players down the Ultramarines route, or any other Space Marine chapter for that matter. The hope is you’ll be able to not only realize that faction you’ve always dreamt about in aesthetic terms, but gameplay terms.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.

                <p>Writer-director Hideo Kojima has shared more thoughts on AI, this time saying he believes the technology is here to stay and "we can't go back."</p><p>Speaking to <a href="https://xtrend.nikkei.com/atcl/contents/casestudy/00012/01783/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Nikkei Xtrend</a>, as translated by <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/action/metal-gear-solid-and-death-stranding-creator-hideo-kojima-thinks-we-cant-go-back-to-a-world-without-ai-smartphones-were-the-same/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">GamesRadar</a>, Kojima said, "Now there are so many people who can't live without their smartphones. AI is like that."</p><p>He added: "I think there isn't any point in saying 'We shouldn't use AI' or 'AI is useless.' We can't go back. Smartphones were the same."</p><p>What Kojima is saying lines up somewhat with the thoughts that Kingdom Come boss Daniel Vavra recently expressed about AI. <a href="https://x.com/DanielVavra/status/2001337278229279169" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">He said</a>, "It's time to face reality. AI is here to stay with us. As frightening as it may be, that's the way it is."</p><p>Also in the interview, Kojima said AI might lead to changes in how people communicate, specifically saying it could help people with social anxiety to communicate better in face-to-face scenarios. At the same time, Kojima said people should be mindful of how much they use AI.</p><p>Before this, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ai-should-be-embraced-not-feared-two-prominent-game-developers-say/1100-6535479/" data-ref-id="1100-6535479">Kojima said people embrace, not fear, the further adoption of AI</a>. He said it can be helpful tool for handling repetitive tasks, allowing human creators to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/kojima-says-ai-could-shape-the-future-of-games-but-silent-hill-f-producer-strongly-disagrees/1100-6535623/" data-ref-id="1100-6535623">focus on more imaginative work.</a></p><p>Of course, not everyone agrees with Kojima, including a Silent Hill f producer who said <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/kojima-says-ai-could-shape-the-future-of-games-but-silent-hill-f-producer-strongly-disagrees/1100-6535623/" data-ref-id="1100-6535623">AI won't be able to make "bold choices" that people can.</a> Lots of other people have also expressed a number of serious concerns about AI, including surrounding topics like job losses and the environmental impact of building out AI infrastructure, among other things.</p><p>Baldur's Gate and Divinity studio Larian recently caused a stir based on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/baldurs-gate-divinity-dev-reveals-how-it-uses-generative-ai/1100-6537001/" data-ref-id="1100-6537001">CEO Swen Vincke's comments about AI</a>.

<figure data-uuid="de54008413b2b"><a title="The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/de54008413b2b/the-elder-scrolls-v-skyrim.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Bethesda</em></figcaption></figure><p>The Nintendo Switch 2 port of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/elder-scrolls-v-skyrim-anniversary-edition">The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim</a> hasn't exactly been well received for a number of reasons, but among the most criticised aspects is the input latency, which <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/12/video-digital-foundry-reviews-skyrim-on-switch-2-and-yeah-its-bad">Digital Foundry tested</a> and claimed was worse than most cloud-streamed games. <em>Yikes</em>.</p>
<p>Well, Bethesda has managed to squeeze a patch out just before the holidays kick in, which focus on that specific problem.</p>
<p>Available to download now, the details are simple, but <a href="https://help.bethesda.net/#en/answer/73362">Bethesda says</a> "In an update on December 19, 2025, we have fixed an issue that caused input latency for <em>Skyrim</em> players on Switch 2."</p><div><figure data-videoid="ox0NHxAh5v8" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ox0NHxAh5v8?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytox0NHxAh5v8" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ox0NHxAh5v8?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ox0NHxAh5v8?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed78ab97gpktzj&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>841k</span></a></p>
</div></figure></div>

<p>So, here's the question — <em>has</em> it actually fixed the problem? We haven't had the chance to test it out yet, but the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NintendoSwitch2/comments/1pqoj34/skyrim_switch_2_update/">NintendoSwitch2 subreddit</a> seems positive on the update.</p>
<p>While it's apparently not perfect, users report that it's "significantly better" and that the latency has been "reduced by what feels like half". So that's something! Though many are still demanding a 60fps update. Maybe one day...</p>
<p>We'll have to see if Digital Foundry go back and revisit the game after the update, but for now, it might be safe to redownload your Switch 2 version of Skyrim.</p>

			<p><strong>GTA 6</strong> is the game that most of the industry has to deal with, one way or another. Its arguably unprecedented (but well deserved, given that GTA 5 is the second best-selling game of all time) hype means developers and publishers of all sizes are doing everything they can to steer clear of its launch date, which, however, has already shifted twice, disrupting many plans and <a href="https://wccftech.com/possibility-of-gta-6-delay-threatens-games-industry-some-companies-are-going-to-tank-if-wrong/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">threatening the very livelihood of certain companies</a>. It's a topic we covered often and in various nuances, including Goichi Suda's recent quip that his new game, Romeo Is a Dead Man, <a href="https://wccftech.com/winning-the-race-against-gta-6-by-not-taking-part-suda51-celebrates-romeo-is-a-dead-man-release-date-announcement/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">'won the game of chicken against GTA 6'</a>.</p>



<p>What we weren't really expecting to cover is Rockstar's game attached to the flailing <strong>MMORPG</strong> genre. And yet, that's what we must do following the statement of an industry veteran. <a href="https://wccftech.com/is-the-mmo-genre-dead-for-western-aaa-developers-we-asked-three-industry-veterans/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">In our fresh, exclusive interview about the state of the MMORPG among Western developers</a>, <strong>Rich Vogel</strong>, whose career credits include titles like Ultima Online, Star Wars Galaxies, Star Wars: The Old Republic, Doom (2016), New World, Halo Infinite, and Gotham Knights, revealed to have heard that many of GTA 6's planned features, if confirmed, would place it on a path to evolve into an MMORPG. </p>



<p>Here's the exact response we got from Vogel when we asked him (and other two MMO vets) whether there's still an audience for a big Western-made massively multiplayer online game:</p>



<p><em>Yes, I believe a large audience is waiting for the right MMORPG to emerge. Consider the millions of players who have played and continue to play WOW, SWTOR, ESO, UO, EverQuest, Fallout 76, and others. The problem is that no publisher is willing to invest the money and take the risk at this time. My instinct tells me that the next major MMORPG will likely come from Asia and/or Europe. <strong>If what I have been hearing about GTA 6's features and gameplay is true, it could evolve into an MMORPG, as many of its planned features are typically found in MMORPGs</strong>.</em></p>



<p>Now, first of all, he's obviously referring to the online mode. While Rockstar hasn't shared any actual details about the game yet except for the setting and the identity of the protagonists, it's a fair bet that there will be a traditional, narrative-driven single player campaign and a separate online mode, just like with GTA 5.</p>



<p>Secondly, Vogel makes no mystery of the fact that he didn't actually work on the next Grand Theft Auto game, so this is second-hand information and should be treated as a rumor. Does it even make sense as an evolution of GTA Online in GTA 6, though?</p>



<p>We'd argue so. GTA 5 has already made a big step toward an online persistent world compared to GTA 4's more limited, session-based multiplayer, and its success was so massive that it overshadowed everything else at the studio, foregoing any need for story-based DLCs like GTA 4's The Lost and Damned and The Ballad of Gay Tony, with new story beats instead deployed to GTA Online.</p>



<p>Moreover, a large hint that this might indeed be the direction Rockstar has taken is the studio's acquisition of <strong>FiveM</strong> maker Cfx.re <a href="https://wccftech.com/previously-banned-gta-5-fivem-and-rdr2-redm-creators-are-now-part-of-rockstar-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">back in August 2023</a>. FiveM, a community-driven modification of GTA 5's base multiplayer, introduced MMORPG-like features such as dedicated servers, far higher player count per session, and the ability to roleplay as a specific role, like a paramedic, a police officer, and many more careers. FiveM became so popular that at one point, it surpassed the concurrent player count of regular GTA 5 Online multiplayer on Valve's Steam. It also significantly contributed to making GTA 5 a consistently high ranking category on streaming platforms like Twitch.</p>



<p>The continued popularity of FiveM shows that there is indeed an appetite for a more persistent, roleplay-inspired experience with larger player counts among the GTA community. Of course, it is unlikely that GTA 6's Online mode will be anything like traditional MMORPGs such as Blizzard's World of Warcraft or even ZeniMax's more recent The Elder Scrolls Online. However, it is entirely possible and even likely that it may incorporate some of their features to engage players in a more seamless, persistent, and immersive living world.</p>



<p>It may not be until well into next year before Rockstar Games shares any official details. Meanwhile, though, we'll keep our ears to the ground for more rumors and leaks about next year's most anticipated game. </p>

            <title><![CDATA[Halo Studios Plans to Remake the Original Trilogy, It’s Claimed]]></title>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>A new claim states that Halo Studios plans to remake the original trilogy. </p>



<p>A couple of months ago, there was a leak about Halo Studios <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/halo-2-and-3-campaign-remakes-development-claim/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">remaking the campaigns</a> for Halo 2 and Halo 3, with a mainline Halo 7 in development that will feature multiplayer. Now, another insider has reiterated these leaks, along with some additional details. </p>







<h2 id="h-halo-trilogy-remakes-reportedly-in-the-works-to-ensure-halo-s-new-era-doesn-t-fail">Halo Trilogy Remakes Reportedly in the Works to Ensure ‘Halo’s New Era Doesn’t Fail’</h2>



<p>The latest bit of information on the Halo Trilogy remakes comes through a new video by Rebs Gaming on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Klr-B5pd_pE" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">YouTube</a>. He first talks about the post by Halo leaks, which had mentioned Halo 2 and Halo 3 getting full campaign remakes. Rebs then discusses Dan Gniady joining Halo Studios as a lead game designer on a new project, which turned out to be the Halo CE Remake. Dan has also seemingly teased that the trilogy is being remade in his LinkedIn post, which reads, “Doing a game direction on a Halo Experience, Giving the Covenant back their bomb.” However, this is just speculation.</p>



<p>Rebs then points at another source that has mentioned Halo Trilogy Remakes, which is TechnicalHalo on <a href="https://x.com/TechnicalHalo" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a>. Rebs talks about their post from 2024, which states that Halo Studios decided to resell the entire series rather than porting the Master Chief Collection to PlayStation for “a higher potential revenue,” and the plan was to remake Halo CE to Halo 3. Additionally, the leaker also stated that Halo 2 and 3 remakes will launch from the same game. </p>



<p>Rebs also did some digging of his own on the Halo Trilogy remake. He first spoke to a former Halo Studios dev, who revealed that the studio is indeed remaking the original games, but didn’t share more details due to an NDA. Another source confirmed the remakes, along with the reason why Halo Studios is remaking games rather than creating new experiences. </p>



<p>The source stated that Microsoft and Halo Studios want to ensure ‘Halo’s new era doesn’t fail,’ so they are playing it safe and avoiding risks. The teams want to avoid making another Halo game, which would draw heavy criticism from OG fans. Hence, they are playing it safe by remaking the original games, as “they can’t afford to fail again,” and the original Halo games were so successful that many fans still play them. </p>



<p>Rebs added that this statement doesn’t mean developers aren’t working on a new Halo project; there are different teams in the studio, with some working only on campaign remakes and others on the multiplayer project.</p>



<p>Readers should note that this information doesn’t come from an official source, so treat it with caution. Official confirmation about a Halo Trilogy remake will only come through the devs. </p>

		<p>Ubisoft have released version 1.23 of The Division, a game released ten years ago and superseded by the cunningly named The Division 2. The new patch does absolutely nothing apart from give PS5 players a 60fps mode. That’s it, nothing else, just a nice 60fps update for the *checks notes* five people still playing the game on PS5.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/05/06/the-division-heartland-announced-standalone-free-to-play-game-coming-out-in-2021-22/">The Division Heartland</a>&nbsp; was meant to be the next game in the series but was cancelled by Ubisoft in 2024, with the publisher confirming the news in a statement to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-cancels-the-division-heartland">IGN</a>. The major reason for the cancellation is that Ubisoft will be redeploying its resources to focus on other projects like xDefiant and Rainbow Six. The team at Red Storm Entertainment, the developers of The Division Heartland, will be redeployed to the other projects.</p>


<p>That didn’t work out too well as XDefiant, Ubisoft’s free-to-play shooter, officially shut down on June 3, 2025, just over a year after its May 2024 launch.</p>
<p>Since then Ubisoft have been busy restructuring their business, starting by <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/08/27/ubisoft-sell-five-old-games-to-atari/">selling off five games</a> to Atari, the games being Cold Fear, I Am Alive, Child of Eden, Grow Home, and Grow Up. They have also<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/05/15/ubisoft-delays-its-biggest-productions-after-ac-shadows-delay-led-to-a-better-game/"> delayed all their “big” games</a> to allow them to be more polished, although they did not say which games these were,</p>

<p>They have also been cuddling up with Tencent to<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/03/27/ubisoft-and-tencent-create-new-subsidiary-just-for-assassins-creed-rainbow-six-far-cry/"> create a subsidiary</a> that will look after three of it’s biggest franchises, Assassin’s Creed, Rainbow Six and Far Cry..</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Ever since <a href="https://wccftech.com/larian-studios-ceo-says-a-lot-has-become-lost-in-translation-over-genai-backlash/">Larian Studios' chief executive officer, Swen Vincke, admitted that the studio is using GenAI technology in its development pipeline for Divinity</a>, the use of GenAI tech in video game development has roared back to the front of the line in the industry's discourse rolodex. Amidst the GenAI conversation Larian started, it appears that renowned creator Hideo Kojima also offered his perspective on GenAI in a recent interview.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/12/12/style/hideo-kojima-death-stranding-2-hnk-intl-dst">In an interview with CNN</a> spotted by <a href="https://www.tweaktown.com/news/109413/kojima-wont-use-ai-to-create-art-thinks-it-could-be-useful-for-responsive-enemy-design/index.html">TweakTown</a> (that actually went live a few days before Bloomberg's interview with Vincke), Kojima, perhaps unsurprisingly, said that he's not exactly interested in using GenAI technology to create anything visual. He doesn't dismiss it entirely, though, as he says he's more interested in how it could be used within the "<em>control systems</em>" of a game than anything else.</p>



<p>"<em>Rather than having AI create visuals or anything like that, I'm more interested in using AI in the control systems</em>," Kojima began. "<em>For example, if you have 100 players, each of them will have their own habits and tendencies, their sense of control, how they move - all of that differs from person to person.</em>"</p>



<p>"<em>By having AI compensate for those differences, the gameplay can gain more depth. And in most games, the enemies don't behave very much like real humans. But by using AI, enemy behavior could change based on the player's experience, actions, and patterns. That kind of dynamic response would make much deeper gameplay possible</em>."</p>



<p>The kind of AI Hideo Kojima is discussing here, particularly with enemy behaviors, is the kind that we are more than used to seeing in video games. <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/horror/alien-isolation-is-way-too-long-because-its-xenomorph-got-way-too-smart-at-the-time-it-didnt-seem-that-long/">Alien: Isolation famously has an incredibly sophisticated enemy AI system built for the Xenomorph</a>, which was a key element of its gameplay that elevates it to being a truly terrifying horror game.</p>



<p>His statement to CNN is also in line <a href="https://wccftech.com/hideo-kojima-sees-creating-together-with-ai-way-stay-one-step-ahead/">with the last time he was asked about GenAI</a>, where he said he'd use it for "<em></em><em>the tedious tasks</em>" while he handled all the actual art.</p>



<p>While some studios, Larian included, are comfortable using GenAI for art and visuals as part of the process, it seems clear that Kojima would much rather have it make the systems and the nitty-gritty elements of development run smoother, so he could focus on what he loves to do, and the thing that actually makes his games iconic.</p>

            <p>Sony and Naughty Dog appear to have brought back the festive videogame industry tradition of mandatory overtime. According to reports, the Last Of Us and Uncharted developers have been crunching for the past seven weeks to finish an internal demo for their new sci-fi action game <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet">Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet</a>.</p><!--more-->
<p>The report in question is from <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-12-18/sony-s-naughty-dog-studio-orders-employee-overtime-on-intergalactic">Bloomberg</a>’s Jason Schreier (paywall), who claims that team members at the Santa Monica-based studio have been asked to work a minimum of eight extra hours a week since late October. To enforce this, Naughty Dog have also allegedly required staff to work in office five days a week - up from three - logging their overtime in an internal spreadsheet. Some staff have had to make hasty short-term care arrangements for children and pets. Naughty Dog have, at least, told staff not to work more than 60 hours a week.</p>
<p>This overtime period is apparently an attempt to get Intergalactic back on track after several missed deadlines, with the game currently slated for console release in mid-2027. Naughty Dog have long had a reputation for crunch, with staff sometimes <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/crunch-once-again-in-the-spotlight-after-damning-report-on-the-last-of-us-2-developer-naughty-dog">needing hospital care as a result</a>, but the Bloomberg piece says that this is the first time in “recent years” that overtime has been mandated across the “bulk” of the studio.</p>
<p>Schreier writes that Naughty Dog introduced a squad of producers in 2021 who were tasked with lessening the load on developers (among other responsibilities), following the gruelling development of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-last-of-us">The Last of Us</a>: Part II. According to “people familiar with the situation”, however, many of those producers are now gone.</p><p>As of this week, most Naughty Dog staff are reportedly now back on normal hours, and management have said that people will once again be able to work two weekdays at home through the end of January, with a more detailed working schedule for 2026 to be presented after the holiday break.</p>
<p>If you’re new to Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet, it’s about a stranded bounty hunter investigating the mysteries of a forgotten planet. It’s Naughty Dog’s first non-sequel videogame in a while, which suggests that there will be a lot of pressure from Sony to deliver results.</p>

            <guid>1388425</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Carrying a separate charger for all your devices – from smartphones to laptops, tablets, earbuds, and smartwatches – can be inconvenient, especially if you’re trying to travel light. This is where a multi-port charger can come in handy, and today is a great time to grab one.</p>
<p>Anker makes some of the best portable charging solutions around, as right now, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6524/">you can snap its 67W Anker Prime USB-C charger with 3 ports for just $37 at Amazon.</a> That’s after a nice 25% discount. The offer is open to both Prime and non-Prime members, plus shipping is free for all shoppers!</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6524/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Power Multiple Devices at Once</h2>
<p>It’s a compact block that’s around 51% smaller than the original 67W MacBook charger. The prongs fold in when not in use, which makes the thing quite easy (and safe) to carry around with you on the go. Small size doesn’t mean a compromise on performance, though.</p>
<p>The charger comes with a total of three ports, including 2 USB-C ports and 1 USB-A port. These are enough to juice all your essentials up at the same time, whether it’s your phone, laptop, or headphones. Connecting a single device lets you enjoy an efficient output of 67W, while the 65W max two-port charging cuts down on charging time by up to 34%. You won’t have to stay tethered to an outlet for long, even when powering multiple devices at the same time. The maximum output of 65W is available whether you’re using both USB-C ports or a mix of USB-C and USB-A. Compatibility-wise, the charger plays nicely with a wide range of devices, from iPhone Series 12 to 17, Samsung Galaxy phones, MacBooks, Pixel phones, iPads, and more.</p>



<p>Stability comes from the combination of partially covered pins and an innovative stacked design that keeps the charger firmly in place. GaNPrime Tech, paired with an upgraded ActiveShield 2.0 system, allows for better heat management and increased security, so you won’t have to worry about dealing with overheating, either.</p>
<p>We highly recommend this charger to anyone who is looking for a no-fuss power solution that can juice multiple devices at once. It’s going to be a great addition to work stations. The compact size makes it just as easy to carry around; simply plug it into an outlet in a cafe, coworking space, or the airport, and keep your devices up and running. This deal brings its price down to just $37, which is nothing considering the convenience and peace of mind it gets you. The box comes with the charger itself, a welcome guide, and a worry-free 24-month warranty for some extra peace of mind.</p>
<p>Getting your orders in today will help get the charger delivered before Christmas, which is great if you’re planning to go on a well-deserved trip during the holidays, and don’t want to carry multiple adapters for a bunch of gadgets.</p>

<p>A 2026 Roadmap for Battlefield 6 has already been laid out, and it includes news on a RedSec Battle Royale Solo mode, and other changes to the core multiplayer gameplay.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-is-uss-best-selling-game-of-2025-year-to-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battlefield 6</a> worked, and the series is back with all sorts of bangs. Call of Duty needed competition, and Battlefield 6 stepped up to the plate with a welcome return to full-scale military warfare. The game’s launch, the addition of RedSec, and Season 1 injected Battlefield goodness into everyone’s veins, but there’s plenty more scheduled for 2026.</p>







<h2 id="h-2026-battlefield-6-roadmap-features-new-redsec-amp-multiplayer-content">2026 Battlefield 6 Roadmap Features New RedSec &amp; Multiplayer Content</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Another great year beckons. Credit to EA</figcaption></figure>



<p>The ‘Battlefield 6 – Community Update – Holiday Wrap-Up’ spoke to the BF community going into Christmas. The player base is expected to grow due to the presence of ‘Xmas noobs,’ and the developer wanted to celebrate ‘an incredible year for the team.’</p>







<p>The blog runs through some obligatory thank you messages to all players—give yourselves a pat on the back—and shares some fascinating numbers. Check out some right here:</p>



<ul>
<li>Played over 1.7 billion matches and logged 383.5 million gameplay hours.</li>



<li>Delivered 12.4 billion kills and 871 million revives.</li>



<li>Destroyed 102 million helicopters and jets.</li>
</ul>



<p>After running through community highlights, it was time for the lowdown on what to expect from 2026.</p>



<p>The team will be “Refining core gameplay, balance, and quality-of-life improvements across Multiplayer, REDSEC, and Portal,” there will be new maps to “introduce fresh tactical opportunities and keep the experience evolving in meaningful ways,” and the developer wants to “Expand Battlefield Labs by bringing more of its experimentation into the live experience.”</p>



<p>Battle Royale players might be interested to hear that BR Solos is still in the pipeline: “We are working through the technical details to deliver it at a quality level that feels right for Battlefield. Once we are confident in the plan and timing, we will share more.”</p>



<p>It’s not a guarantee that it’s happening, but its arrival is likely happening.</p>

<p>This time of year is always an exciting time for those with oodles of subscriptions or memberships to various online platforms, because it’s when all the ‘wrapped’ presentations drop. From Spotify to PlayStation and from LinkedIn to YouTube, many platforms partake in the annual wrapped festival, offering key insights into your year as a subscriber or member.</p>



<p>That is, all except for Xbox. In a recent report, it was claimed that Xbox isn’t providing an ‘Xbox Wrapped’ presentation this year because the company has better things to spend its marketing budget on.</p>







<h2 id="h-no-xbox-wrapped-unfortunately">No Xbox Wrapped, Unfortunately</h2>



<p>There were <em>wrapped </em>presentations hailing from all corners of the gaming world this year. The likes of PlayStation, Steam, Discord, and even Nintendo have provided <strong>some kind </strong>of recap for 2025 in gaming. It was a veritable plethora of data for gamers to absorb, but it’s important to stress it’s all just a bit of fun, with some potential bragging rights tacked on.</p>



<p>In a recent report from Windows Central, it was claimed that Xbox isn’t doing a wrapped celebration this year because there’s far too much happening <strong>next year, </strong>and the marketing budget wouldn’t cover it.</p>



<p>Here’s the snippet <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/xbox-is-not-doing-an-xbox-wrapped-this-year-but-does-have-big-plans-for-the-25th-anniversary" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">from Jez Corden</a>:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>My sources suggest that (as you might expect given that it’s now the 18th), that Xbox is not doing a “Wrapped” this year.</p>



<p>A lot of the “marketing budget” that would’ve typically been allocated to something like an “Xbox Wrapped” is being poured into efforts to celebrate these major milestones for Xbox, its brands, and some of its games.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>As professed recently by Xbox ahead of the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/next-xbox-developer-direct-promises-huge/">upcoming Developer Direct</a>, there are stacks of milestones landing in 2026. For instance, Xbox is celebrating a quarter-century in the business, while Bethesda is ticking off its 40th birthday.</p>



<p>If you were holding out hope that Xbox was just waiting a bit longer than everyone else to release Xbox Wrapped this year, you’re out of luck.</p>







<p>Let us know on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a> how <strong>you think </strong>you did this year within the Xbox ecosystem.</p>

                <p>Generative AI has been at the forefront of the conversation for the past few years, with companies becoming divisive on how to implement it, if at all. Larian CEO Swen Vincke recently kicked a hornet's nest after saying the studios' developers <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/baldurs-gate-divinity-dev-reveals-how-it-uses-generative-ai/1100-6537001/" data-ref-id="1100-6537001">use generative AI tools for things like exploring new game ideas, developing concept art, creating placeholder text, and for PowerPoint presentations</a>. After a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/baldurs-gate-divinity-dev-reveals-how-it-uses-generative-ai/1100-6537001/" data-ref-id="1100-6537001">quick retraction and explanation</a>, along with sharing that the studio was in fact growing its pool of artists rather than shrinking. Vincke has admitted that Larian uses AI for tasks nobody wants to do, but does AI--even at the concept art stage--help actual concept artists?</p><p>According to a handful of video game concept artists, it can actually make things harder. Talking to Edmond Tran from <a href="https://thisweekinvideogames.com/feature/concept-artists-in-games-say-generative-ai-references-only-make-their-jobs-harder/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">This Week In Video Games</a>, artists said that it complicates their workflow and doesn't help them creatively.</p><p>"I'm seeing more and more clients generate something approximating their desired outcome and essentially asking me to make 'something like this,'" said Paul Scott Canavan, an artist who has worked as an art director and concept artist for projects like Destiny 2, Heroes of the Storm, Guild Wars 2, and Netflix's The Witcher. "It sucks. This practice absolutely invalidates the entire creative process, in my opinion, and makes my job harder and more frustrating. The job of an illustrator or concept artist is to draw from their years of experience to interpret a brief in a creative way."</p><p>Another freelance designer and illustrator, Kim Hu, who worked as the lead artist on Rollerdrome (and possible the world's biggest fan of Marvel's Taskmaster), says even starting with AI images "robs you of discovery, as it will likely more or less give you exactly what you asked of it", and says that looking at the real world and references helps with creation and maybe adds on something you didn't think of before, "informing and branching out your ideas further." She adds that going down these accidental rabbit holes is a pivotal step in concept and world-building for her.</p><p>A senior concept artist, who asked to remain anonymous due to their position at a major game developer, told Tran that studio leadership now asks them to work from AI-generated reference material. They said that this often requires "reverse engineering where the pieces of the image composite came from, and working off what I'm able to find through careful searches on the internet--things like hairstyles, clothing, props, and so on."</p><p>Beyond protecting the company from potential legal risk, particularly given that the project involves a well-known IP, the artist said they feel a principled obligation to take on this extra work for the benefit of their colleagues.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>It’s often said that you don’t get a second chance to make a first impression, but this is precisely what developers Spiders are hoping to do with the most recent overhaul to their prequel to the cult favourite RPG, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/09/09/greedfall-review/">Greedfall</a>. When it first launched in Early Access late last year the initial response was fairly negative, with many players left confused by its title suggesting a sequel, and many others left underwhelmed by the switch to a tactical turn-based combat system. To their credit, Spiders took this criticism on board and suspended their proposed roadmap in order to address the most pressing issues raised by players. I got the chance to have a hands-on look at the most recent build and can report that it is definitely improving.</p>
<p><iframe title="GreedFall 2 |  2nd Major Update" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pPhs61akKWY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>First up, I have to confess that my time with the new build was not the most optimal of experiences, playng remotely and with my connection suffering from frame rate drops and technical issues. I’m obviously looking past these hiccups, but it did mean that I didn’t really get to enjoy some of the later parts of the demo. That being said, I got to see enough to be cautiously optimistic that The Dying World can find an appreciative audience.</p>


<p>The demo build contained three main areas for me to explore, with the opening section and two saves at crucial later parts in the story. The opening section of the game plays out similarly to the original version, with you playing the role as a native Teer Fradee. You get to familiarise yourself with the basic mechanics and immerse yourself in the traditions and beliefs of the tribes before coming into conflict with the colonial forces that are just starting to exploit the land.</p>


<p>This introduction works well as a tutorial and my second time experiencing it highlighted the more streamlined and intuitive combat system. The most important change here is that you can now control your companions in a far more traditional style and queue up attacks to take advantage of their skills and abilities. Each character and class has a distinct set of skills, but it looks like you can diversify or specialise to your heart’s content as you level up.</p>
<p>The setting and atmosphere of The Dying World are one of the real highlights as there is a rich and detailed sense of world-building here. Reams of optional lore and conversation choices are available for those who want to explore as much as they can and the game is not shy in highlighting the contrasts between the tribal traditions and the colonial powers that invade. This contrast comes into direct conflict at the end of the opening section and your player character is thrust into an entirely new environment.</p>

<p>The two later sections showed different areas and recruited companions that really emphasised the game’s focus on cultural conflict and exchange. Each companion seemed to have an interesting set of characteristics and motivation for joining your adventure. Obviously the finer details were not available as I was thrust into the middle of quests and storylines, but it left me intrigued as to how the story would develop. Deeper into the game, combat felt more developed as the characters were appropriately levelled and had more abilities to balance and tactical approaches to take.</p>
<p>The final section in the demo saw me return to the lands in which you grew up and this seems to suggest a clear connection between the conclusion of this game and the world of Greedfall. Unfortunately it was here that my connection to the stream became untenable, but in retrospect this wasn’t a bad thing since it leaves me itching to find out how the story develops.</p>

<p>All in all I was left far more impressed with this experience than my first try at the released build. Greedfall: The Dying World is very much an old-fashioned RPG in the style of Dragon Age: Origins and this change from the more accessible action combat of Greedfall may well still be make or break for the game and its original cohort of fans. There’s still time for the Early Access version to be developed with Spiders announcing that there will be news about the full release early in 2026, so as things stand I’d definitely encourage RPG fans to add the game to their wishlist and see how the final build turns out when we get a chance to play it.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Action games have been in a remarkably strong position for several years now. <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-action-games-of-2024-no-enemy-left-standing/"><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">While standout surprises and new hits defined 2024</strong></a>, 2025 felt like the year when many of the genre’s most anticipated projects finally released. It was also the year when legendary franchises finally returned, and established formulas were refined to greater polish.</p>



<p>With so many great action games coming out in the past 12 months, deciding which five should be considered the best wasn't an easy task. However, our top picks have that little something that puts them above every other game, making them a must-play for all fans of the genre.</p>



<h2 id="h-ninja-gaiden-4-8-7">Ninja Gaiden 4 (<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/ninja-gaiden-4-bathed-in-blood/">8.7</a>)</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Ninja-Gaiden-4.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Ninja Gaiden 4 is an excellent return for the series</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>After having been on hiatus for many years, and with Team NINJA focusing on action RPGs like the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/nioh-2-the-complete-edition-grave-no-bar/"><strong>Nioh series</strong></a>, it seemed like the Ninja Gaiden franchise was done. However, 2025 proved that this wasn't the case. One of the premier character action series is not only alive, but is also doing very, very well.</p>



<p>Ninja Gaiden 4 is notable not only for bringing back the franchise but for being the result of a collaboration between PlatinumGames and Team NINJA, a dream collaboration for all fans of the genre. And while some of the typical PlatinumGames gameplay mechanics may have diluted what hardcore Ryu Hayabusa fans believe is the real Ninja Gaiden, the game is undoubtedly one of the best action games of the year, and a great title to celebrate the legacy of Tomonobu Itagaki, <a href="https://wccftech.com/tomonobu-itagaki-creator-dead-or-alive-ninja-gaiden-passed-away-at-58/"><strong>who sadly passed away this year.</strong></a></p>



<p>Kai Tatsumoto highlighted well the game's strengths and minor flaws, saying in his review: <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">"Some of PlatinumGames' best character action to date is muddled with a bloated first half and an otherwise uninteresting protagonist. However, as the narrative picks up, this ninja doesn't stop until long after the credits roll.</em></p>



<h2 id="h-metroid-prime-4-beyond-8-5">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond (<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/metroid-prime-4-beyond-scanning-wider-horizons/">8.5</a>)</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Metroid-Prime-4-Beyond.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>The long wait for Metroid Prime 4: Beyond was well worth it</em></figcaption></figure>



<p><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed"><a data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" href="https://wccftech.com/metroid-prime-4-announced-switch/">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond was announced so long ago</a></strong> that the many years of silence made most fans of the series lose hope that the game would ever be released. The little information that filtered through the grapevine wasn't very promising either, but the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed"><a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/metroid-prime-4-retro-studios/">eventual return of Retro Studios to the franchise</a></strong> provided that little spark of hope fans needed.</p>



<p>In 2025, Metroid Prime 4: Beyond finally launched, and it met expectations, for the most part. While the story is a little forgettable, and its conclusion a little flat, the game does well everything that makes the series what it is: great level design, engaging combat, and a fantastic atmosphere powered by some of the best visuals seen on the original Nintendo Switch.</p>



<p>In his review, Nathan Birch highlighted how these elements come together to offer a compelling experience that is just a little short of excellence: <em data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)">"Metroid Prime 4: Beyond ascends to higher peaks than any previous Prime entry, delivering an impressive sense of scale, breathtaking visuals, and classic Metroid level design at its most immersive and riveting, but a few missteps, including an unengaging story and flat final act, may exclude it from best-of-series conversations. </em></p>



<h2 id="h-ghost-of-yotei-8-8">Ghost of Yōtei (<a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://wccftech.com/review/ghost-of-yotei-exploring-the-price-of-vengeance-in-17th-century-ezo/">8.8</a>)</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Ghost-of-Yotei-Key-art.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Ghost of Yōtei enhances the foundation of its predecessor considerably</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Ghost of Yōtei had some rather big shoes to fill this year. Despite not innovating open-world games significantly, <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://wccftech.com/review/ghost-of-tsushima-duty-heavier-than-a-mountain-death-lighter-than-a-feather/"><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Ghost of Tsushima delivered a very engaging experience</strong></a>, with protagonist Jin Sakai's struggles to maintain a shred of samurai honor as he battled the Mongols out of Tsushima being the absolute highlight.</p>



<p>Although the story may not be as engaging for those seeking total historical accuracy, Ghost of Yōtei has refined its predecessor's experience to deliver yet another engaging open-world experience. With improved gameplay expanding both combat and exploration, which moves away from the waymarker-filled approach of its predecessor, spectacular boss fights and striking visuals, the second entry in the series is a game worth experiencing for all fans of the series.</p>



<p>Alessio Palumbo put it well how Ghost of Yōtei is a worthy sequel to its predecessor in his review: <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">"Ghost of Yōtei is a worthy sequel to the already excellent Ghost of Tsushima, building upon that game's foundation with an equally interesting (albeit quite different) plot and select improvements to combat and open world exploration. It may feel a little too familiar, not to mention similar to the previous game, but that sensation is quickly forgotten amidst all the fun you'll have in Ezo.</em>"</p>



<h2 id="h-the-first-berserker-khazan-9-0">The First Berserker: Khazan (<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-first-berserker-khazan-review-stranger-of-pell-los/">9.0</a>)</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/The-First-Berserker-Khazan.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>The First Berserker: Khazan provides an excellent action game experience with an intricate web of deep mechanics</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>The First Berserker: Khazan made a few head turns when <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://wccftech.com/the-first-berserker-khazan-is-a-single-player-action-rpg-based-in-the-dnf-universe/"><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">it was announced in 2023</strong></a> with its great-looking cel-shaded visuals and charismatic protagonist voiced by Ben Starr (<a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/review/final-fantasy-xvi-the-planets-dyin-clive/"><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Final Fantasy XVI</strong></a>, <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/review/clair-obscur-expedition-33-dont-fear-the-paintress/"><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</strong></a>). The prospect of another soulslike in 2025 did not make many too excited about it, but the game developed by Neople surpassed all expectations.</p>



<p>More than a soulslike inspired by FromSoftware games, The First Berserker: Khazan is more akin to an action game developed by Team NINJA, sporting a web of interconnected gameplay mechanics enhanced by a deep loot system that makes the game's high-speed, high-intensity combat even more engaging.</p>



<p>Being a massive fan of Team NINJA, I couldn't help but enjoy The First Berserker: Khazan<strong data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(26, 87, 132, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(26, 87, 132, 0.2)"> </strong>a lot, as I highlighted in my review:<em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed"> "With its excellent combat system, complementary mechanics, solid level and enemy design, and engaging story, The First Berserker: Khazan stands out as one of the best action RPGs in recent years.</em>"</p>

<p>Following Hideo Kojima's departure from KONAMI, the Metal Gear series seemed all but done. However, Naked Snake stealthed his way onto modern-day gaming hardware with Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater, a remake of the beloved third entry in the series.</p>



<p>In an era where remakes usually change much of the games they are based on, with mixed results, KONAMI opted to be as faithful as possible to Hideo Kojima's creation, introducing only <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/metal-gear-solid-delta-gameplay-changes/"><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">a slew of gameplay improvements that enhance the experience</strong></a> while offering players the chance to experience the game mostly as it was via the Legacy Style controls. And while something more could have been done to modernize the experience, the developer's choices proved to be the right ones.</p>



<p><em data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-all dracula-processed">"KONAMI</em><em> </em><em data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-all dracula-processed">has promised (and delivered) a faithful reproduction of Snake Eater, brought forth into a new console generation without deviating from the title it was based on,"</em> said Kai Tatsumoto in his review</p>



<h2 id="h-honorable-mentions">Honorable Mentions</h2>

			<p>If you could turn the clocks back a week from today, you'd return to a world where no one (at least publicly) was hurling vitriol and hate towards Larian Studios. Everyone was actually quite excited about what the studio had coming, since it had <a href="https://wccftech.com/larian-studios-announces-divinity-the-game-awards-2025/">just announced a new Divinity game</a> at <a href="https://wccftech.com/topic/tga/">The Game Awards</a>, which was inarguably one of the biggest announcements of the night.</p>



<p>In the week since that reveal, things have looked quite different from Larian, <a href="https://wccftech.com/divinity-is-a-turn-based-rpg-will-be-way-better-than-baldurs-gate-3-says-larian/">after an interview with Bloomberg (and several other outlets)</a> with Larian's chief executive officer, Swen Vincke, revealed that Larian Studios was using generative AI technology in its development pipeline for Divinity. That admittance was the reason players criticized and chastised Larian Studios online, and the reason behind the recent stir of discussion of generative AI use in game development.</p>



<p>Vincke has since<a href="https://wccftech.com/larian-studios-ceo-responds-backlash-over-genai-use-divinity-baldurs-gate-3/"> responded to the backlash with a more formal statement sent to IGN and a less-formal statement posted to his account on X (formerly Twitter)</a>, where he exclaimed, "<em>Holy f*** guys,</em> <em>we're not 'pushing hard' for or replacing concept artists with AI</em>."</p>



<p>Amidst the backlash, former developers who worked at Larian also stood up to comment on what the introduction of GenAI tech did for their experience working at the studio. Game writers and narrative designers have <a href="https://wccftech.com/game-writers-call-out-larian-studios-for-poor-hiring-practices-amidst-genai-backlash/">also stood up to call out Larian for its poor hiring practices</a>, taking the chance to voice concerns they had held for some time, but refrained from speaking out against for fear of burning future professional opportunities and/or out of respect for the writers still working at Larian.</p>



<p>On the other side, <a href="https://wccftech.com/larian-said-they-were-doing-something-absolutely-everyone-is-doing-ai-hysteria/">Warhorse Studios founder and creative director Daniel Vávra stood up to defend Larian,</a> saying, <em>"</em><em>Larian said they were doing something that absolutely everyone else is doing and got an insanely crazy sh*tstorm</em>."</p>



<p>Now, in what appears to be a final statement on the issue for 2025, Swen Vincke <a href="https://x.com/LarAtLarian/status/2001704942562660649">took to his personal X (formerly Twitter) account to speak on the matter</a> once again.</p>



<p>"<em>It's been a week since we announced Divinity, our next RPG, and a lot has become lost in translation</em>," Vincke began. "<em>Larian’s DNA is agency. Everything we work towards is to the benefit of our teams, games, and players. A better work day, and a better game. Our successes come from empowering people to work in their own way and bring the best out of their skill &amp; craft, so that we can make the best RPGs we can possibly make."</em></p>



<p>"<em>In that context, it would be irresponsible for us not to evaluate new technologies. However, our processes are always evolving, and where they are not efficient or fail to align with who we are, we will make changes."</em></p>

</div></figure>



<p>Vincke goes on to say that the company will host an AMA event in the new year, giving those with concerns over Larian Studios using generative AI technology the chance to directly ask the studio whatever they want. No doubt that Vincke and he rest of the team at Larian would also hope that the AMA will be where they can explain themselves in a way that quells the vitriol we've seen towards Larian this past week.</p>



<p>For additional context, Bloomberg's Jason Schreier, who authored the interview with Vincke that started this whole controversy, shared the rough, unedited transcript of his conversation with Vincke. You can read it below.</p>

			<p>[<strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">UPDATE - December 19, 10:23 AM</strong>] Though an official confirmation has yet to be provided, it's all but confirmed that more Nintendo Switch 2 cartridge options are being offered to publishers. According to ININ Games, two new, smaller cartridge sizes were announced this week by Nintendo, allowing the publisher to release R-Type Dimensions III on a physical cartridge in Europe.</p>



<p>The downside is that the price of the game will increase by 10€, essentially confirming that some publishers will still prefer using Game-Key Cards to keep costs down.</p>

<p>Original story follows.</p>



<p>[<strong>Original Story</strong>] The launch of the Nintendo Switch 2 earlier this year was accompanied by a radical change for retail releases with the Game-Key cards, which essentially act as a bridge between a retail and a digital release, requiring users to download the full game on their systems to play it using said cards as a sort of access license.</p>



<p>Although the community has been very vocal about their dislike about these releases for justifiable reasons, it seems like Game-Key Cards are here to stay, even with Nintendo attempting to address the issue that made many developers pick this format over a traditional cartdrige.</p>



<p>As reported by <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:porwhxzwut6vszlqjcvnmmag/post/3ma6x4jlgkk2u?ref_src=embed"><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Nintendeal on Bluesky</strong></a>, the Japanese company is seemingly producing smaller-capacity Nintendo Switch 2 cartridges that would allow more developers to publish proper retail releases of their games.</p>



<p><em>"Due to chip shortages it will take time before we see widespread availability,"</em> Nintendeal added, but this won't be the only reason why it may be more time until more Switch 2 games receive traditional retail releases. <em>"Despite the smaller capacity, these cards will still be expensive due to rising cost of materials,"</em> the user continued, predicting that <em>"Game-Key Cards are not going away."</em></p>



<p>The widespread use of Game-Key Cards for Nintendo Switch 2 games' retail releases is reportedly caused by <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-game-key-cards-will-likely-be-widespread-due-to-limited-cartdrige-options/"><strong>physical cartridges coming with a single 64 GB option</strong></a>, which could be too expensive for games coming in smaller sizes and are simply not enough for larger games. </p>



<p>Nintendo's reported decision to produce <span>smaller-capacity cartridges is definitely a step in the right direction, but under the current circumstances, developers may continue to prefer using Game-Key cards to keep costs down and&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-game-key-cards-are-necessary-to-overcome-cartridge-limitations-ffvii-rebirth-director-says/" target="_blank"><strong>overcome some technical limitations</strong></a>, to the disappointment of every fan of physical game releases</span>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Black Ops 7 Discounted by 50% Just One Month After Release]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-7-discount-by-50-percent-month/</link>
            <guid>1388383</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 did not land well with fans. It emerged amidst a <strong>packed </strong>schedule that included titans like ARC Raiders and Battlefield 6, a fact that might have hindered the game’s success beyond all belief. It doesn’t help that the campaign was seen as lacklustre, and the multiplayer platform isn’t what most fans were clamouring for.</p>



<p>In what seems like a bout of recognition of the poor review scores and lack of hype around the latest Call of Duty title, Best Buy has slashed the price. Right now, for one day only, you can get Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 for just <strong>$34.99</strong>, barely five weeks after release.</p>







<h2 id="h-the-mighty-are-falling">The Mighty Are Falling</h2>



<p>Call of Duty has been on a generational run of bad luck of late. Last year’s Black Ops 6 was pretty good, but the success found at launch tailed off very quickly. It proved to be a good year across the board for activations and the game’s esports scene, but the series floundered hard and continues to do so, with this year’s release.</p>



<p>Black Ops 7 just didn’t hit the mark with fans. It fell short in early reviews and managed to dredge up a Metascore of just 67, with a woeful user rating on the same platform of just 1.6. Those are some of the lowest numbers <strong>ever achieved </strong>by a Call of Duty game.</p>



<p>When you align that with the surrounding titles, such as the uber-impressive ARC Raiders and the revitalization of a franchise in Battlefield 6, you paint a clear picture for Activision and Call of Duty.</p>



<p>While yes, the game was the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-was-the-best-selling-game-in-november-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">best-selling game in the United States</a> and is the most played game on Xbox Game Pass, COD fatigue appears to be alive and well in late 2025. </p>



<p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-is-already-half-price-at-most-retailers-barely-a-month-after-release" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">IGN</a> noticed that Best Buy is selling Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 for <strong>one day only </strong><a href="https://www.bestbuy.com/product/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-playstation-5/JJGXPXZ5GX" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">for just $34.99</a>. That’s a 50% discount, but it’s not too far from what other retailers are selling the game for.</p>



<p>It’s <strong>also </strong>only <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/visit/black-ops-7-g2a-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">$35 <strong>right now </strong>on G2A</a>, and that’s not a one-day sale. It’s one of the cheapest places to buy Black Ops 7.</p>



<p>Even Activision recently came out and stressed that, going forward, the Call of Duty sub-franchises will not <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-back-to-back-releases/">see back-to-back releases</a>. It failed with Modern Warfare II and Modern Warfare III, and it has now failed again with Black Ops 6 and Black Ops 7.</p>

<p>Hideo Kojima recently spoke about his upcoming horror title, OD, asking fans to watch the trailer numerous times just to get a hint of what it is about. </p>



<p>For those curious, OD is the upcoming game from Hideo Kojima, developed for Xbox Game Studios. The only information we have about the title is that it will be a horror game, along with additional hints revealed in the ‘<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/od-gameplay-reveal-kojima/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Knock</a>‘ teaser earlier this year. However, it appears that the teaser contained more clues than players initially realized.</p>







<h2 id="h-hideo-kojima-talks-about-a-big-hint-in-od-s-trailer">Hideo Kojima Talks About a ‘Big Hint’ in OD’s Trailer</h2>



<p>During a new interview with <a href="https://xtrend.nikkei.com/atcl/contents/casestudy/00012/01783/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Nikkei Xtrend</a> (translated by <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/horror/hideo-kojima-says-watch-the-od-teaser-trailer-100-times-and-youll-get-a-big-hint-about-what-his-new-horror-game-actually-is-i-cant-say-anything-else/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GamesRadar+</a>), Hideo Kojima spoke about rewatching OD’s trailer for hints. Kojima first talks about the game being unlike any other and how, at first glance, OD looks like horror: “but the system it uses isn’t ordinary.” The game director adds that everything is made in a game engine, but it’s a “system like no other”, which is why they built “a completely new medium together with Microsoft.” </p>



<p>Hideo Kojima then went on to say that he can’t reveal more details about OD, or “Mr Phil will be mad at me.” However, if players “watch the teaser trailer many times there’s a hint.” Kojima will not be able to reveal what it is, but if players “watch it 100 times… At the end of the trailer it reads ‘for all players and screamers’. That’s also a big hint.”</p>







<p>In other news, Hideo Kojima isn’t sure <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hideo-kojima-doesnt-know-if-od-will-work-out/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">whether OD will work out</a>. Additionally, the game director has compared AI to smartphones, stating <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hideo-kojima-compares-ai-to-smartphones-says-theres-no-going-back/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">there’s no going back</a>.
