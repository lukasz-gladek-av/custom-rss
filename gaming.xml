Just about every party and club I’ve been to in the past few months has played the song <em>at least </em>once, and a recently released music video has catapulted its popularity even higher.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/warhorse-kingdom-come-deliverance-2-immersive/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 was revealed in April, stunning fans worldwide with sumptuous visuals and a continuation of the story that was left wide open at the end of the original game, which dropped in 2018. This next-generation RPG experience promises to be visceral, authentic, and expansive, and a recent interview with Warhorse Studios’ Lead Scripter has revealed that it’s going to be one of the most immersive RPG titles ever made.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-immersed-in-a-real-medieval-bohemia">Immersed ‘In a Real Medieval Bohemia’</h2>



<p>In a recent interview published on epicgames.com, Warhorse Studios’ Martin Ziegler breaks down the intricacies of the storytelling, world-building, and freedom elements that make up the beating heart of Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2. From the wide-open world that’s based on a real location to the density of the living, breathing cities, players will find themselves immersed in this game like never before.</p>



<p>Ziegler revealed that a team of expert historians, reenactors, professors, and a diverse crew of advisors were brought in to finesse Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 and make it intensely authentic. With a combat overhaul landing in this follow-up title, fighting enemies in battle is more realistic but at the same more accessible than in the first game:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We’re introducing many iterative changes to the combat, some aiming to make it more accessible to people for which it was too complex in the first game—and in the other direction, some making it even deeper for players who enjoyed it already and are looking to engage with it even more intensely in the sequel. In addition to all of the weapon classes from the first game, there are also crossbows and rudimentary gunpowder rifles now, which bring their own tactical implications.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Ziegler then explained that players are free to approach the entire game as they see fit. In the breakdown <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/news/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii-medieval-rpg-preview" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">written on the Epic Games site</a>, it was stressed that players can take whatever path they can imagine. In one mission, they could go in stealthily, opt to poison enemies, take them out from a distance with a ranged weapon, or rush in and face them head-on. </p>



<p>Exploring the world will feel much like the first game, too. Every character on the map will have a life that they live, taking them from work to the tavern, then back home for a meal and to go to sleep. This was how things worked in the first title, but Ziegler informed Epic that the authenticity of this replication of medieval life has been boosted immeasurably for Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2.</p>



<p>This is one of my most-wanted games for 2024, without question. I recently <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tom-mckay-interview-kingdom-come/">sat down and interviewed Tom McKay</a>, who plays Henry of Skalitz in Kingdom Come, and the chat filled me with excitement for what’s in store later this year.</p>

There's a lot of them," Vincke said. "This has been a real problem." Baldur's Gate 3 was the surprise hit of 2023, earning myriad game of the year awards including from <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-wins-game-of-the-year-from-new-york-video-game-critics-circle">the New York Video Game Critics Circle</a>, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-game-awards-2023-winners-the-full-list">The Game Awards</a>, the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gayming-awards-2024-winners-baldurs-gate-3-wins-over-tears-of-the-kingdom-and-spider-man-2">Gayming Awards</a>, the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/game-developers-choice-awards-2024-winners-the-full-list">Game Developers Choice Awards</a>, and more.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>It is surprisingly draining on the soul.</p></div><p>Vincke insisted he was still appreciative of the awards, as "it's great that you have a moment of celebration" and Larian does "really appreciate it," but sending key members away to each award show seemingly left the development team fragmented.</p><p>It "would be cool if everybody could agree to do it all at the same time," Vincke said. "It is surprisingly draining on the soul."</p><p>This continued focus on Baldur's Gate 3 also stopped Larian from getting closure, he added "We've all been more emotional because we can't get closure, and you want to have closure at the end of a project."</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Baldur's Gate 3 Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>That being said, Larian has paid plenty of attention to Baldur's Gate 3 itself in the myriad updates released following launch, but perhaps Vincke is implying there wouldn't have been so many if the game wasn't so successful.</p><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-mod-support-sounds-like-its-final-major-update">The final major update is due in September 2024</a>, when Larian releases <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-official-mod-support-arrives-this-september">official mod support for Baldur's Gate 3</a>.

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/kunitsu-gami-path-of-goddess-review-tactical-demon-slaying</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/kunitsu-gami-path-of-the-goddess-review-%E2%80%93-tactical-demon-slaying.927756/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/kunitsu-gami-path-of-goddess-review-tactical-demon-slaying<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess</em> feels like a throwback to an earlier time in the game industry. The experimental age of the 2000s where developers had the freedom to mess around with genre convention and aesthetics. The era that spawned cult hits like <em>God Hand</em>, <em>Okami</em>, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/yoshinori-ono-says-onimusha-discussions-happening-at-capcom" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Onimusha</em></a>. In that spirit, Capcom has developed a game that blends two disparate genres, resulting in one of 2024's most pleasant surprises.</p>

<p>The set-up for <em>Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess</em> plays out like a folk tale. A mountain has become infested with a demonic force known as the Seethe. The only one who can purify the mountain is a priestess named Yoshiro. Given how lethal the Seethe is, Yoshiro summons a spirit warrior named Soh to protect her and provide guidance. But Soh is just one warrior. If they intend to save the mountain and its people, Soh must strategically recruit and command local villagers to protect Yoshiro and purify the land one step at a time.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/kunitsu-gami-path-of-the-goddess-purifying-torii-gate.jpg?itok=OzE0ADjP 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/kunitsu-gami-path-of-the-goddess-purifying-torii-gate.jpg?itok=KSG_7JTe 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Alright, one done, about two dozen to go.</figcaption></figure><p>With that simple premise, <em>Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess</em> frames its entire gameplay loop: a mix of third-person action, and real-time tower defense. You explore the map by day, purifying areas, recruiting villagers, and guiding Yoshiro towards a torii gate. By night, you and the villagers protect Yoshiro from waves of Seethe. Get Yoshiro to purify all torii gates in the area and you complete the level.</p>
<p>The idea of blending tactical strategy and fast-paced action <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/features/brutal-legend-eddie-riggs" rel="noopener" target="_blank">isn't exactly new</a> in games but <em>Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess</em> 'gameplay demonstrates a high level of polish and intentional design.</p>
<p>This is most apparent in how it melds action and strategy together. Generally, Soh's combat prowess is no different from other hack-and-slash protagonists. Light attack, heavy attack, block, and dodge. But enemy waves are aggressive and numerous.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/kunitsu-gami-path-of-the-goddess-soh-combat.jpg?itok=9ZLFKI1V 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/kunitsu-gami-path-of-the-goddess-soh-combat.jpg?itok=d8Dc5ek2 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Yes, I pushed back enemies at one gate. There are other gates in the level.</figcaption></figure><p>You can feasibly bottleneck one wave of Seethe with a string of deadly attacks, but what about the two other waves coming elsewhere? You can slice through ground-based enemies, but what about the deadly aerial assassins? What happens when Seethe makes it to Yoshiro and you're on the other side of the map? What happens when you get overwhelmed?</p>
<p>Enter the real-time defense elements. Purifying an area grants you crystals. Crystals can be used to assign villagers different roles. These roles can range from simple axe fighters and archers to more complex sumo wrestlers and cannoneers. Crystals also purify Yoshiro's path to the torii gates, letting her progress. Do you try to get Yoshiro to the goal quickly, or do you invest in sturdy defenses and take your time?</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/kunitsu-gami-path-of-the-goddess-poison-swamp-gameplay.jpg?itok=iV2J_73J 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/kunitsu-gami-path-of-the-goddess-poison-swamp-gameplay.jpg?itok=RY8r8dXi 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Poison swamp? Better break out the long-range units.</figcaption></figure><p>The time and resource management in these levels compounds with the introduction of the craftsman. The craftsman can repair areas or traps in a level, which can either slow down Seethe or enhance your allies. This leads to plenty of small tactical decisions that can mean victory or defeat during the day. A single damage trap can mean the difference between being overwhelmed and getting to the end.</p>
<p>Like the action sections, the strategy elements of <em>Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess</em> are straightforward in isolation. If you're familiar with the genre, various staples are present and accounted for – cheap reliable melee and ranged units, costly support units, pricey dedicated units, etc.. But when combined with the robust enemy variety and Soh's responsive combat, the entire experience is an electric rush of time management and intense sieges.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/kunitsu-gami-path-of-the-goddess-ship-combat.jpg?itok=ZAwwHyp7 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/kunitsu-gami-path-of-the-goddess-ship-combat.jpg?itok=hE4c1P-- 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Alright, archers in front, ascetics stay in the backline. I'll handle any boarding parties.</figcaption></figure><p>It is a fantastic gameplay foundation made juicier with thoughtful level design. Each map in the game is compact; you can go from end to end in about a minute. Each element of the map is intentionally placed – every fork in the path, every branching path, every bottleneck. Furthermore, every single map has some unique environmental or architectural twist – managing visibility in a dark cave, coordinating naval combat on a storm-ridden lake, the list goes on.</p>
<p>But the biggest draw by far is how refined and effortless unit management is. Place a unit in an area, and they will attack anything within a certain area. If they're a defense unit they will buff, debuff, or heal the same way. It may not be as complex as <em>Command &amp; Conquer</em>, but for something more fast-paced it works.</p>
<p>If there is one area where the game's combat stretches too thin, it is in the boss fights. They can range from complex multi-level tests of spatial reasoning and tactics to annoying health sponges with tedious unblockable attacks; the source of a few ragequits.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/kunitsu-gami-path-of-the-goddess-cave-base-management.jpg?itok=Wrq8gJaz 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/kunitsu-gami-path-of-the-goddess-cave-base-management.jpg?itok=9lHzCKjA 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Yes, you can pet the dog here. I have no notes.</figcaption></figure><h2><em>Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess</em> Review – Restoring The Mountain</h2>
<p>In addition to satisfying moment-to-moment gameplay, <em>Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess'</em> macro progression is great. Clearing levels earns you Musubi, which can be used to improve the stats of different unit types or unlock additional abilities for Soh. These improvements range from simple health and damage increases to unlocking more complex commands for your units.</p>
<p>Both Musubi and crystals you earn carry over between levels, adding a layer of long-term management. There were more than a few occasions where I had to make due with basic axemen and archers because I blew my crystal budget on riflemen and spearmen in a boss fight. Conversely, I put my Musubi into maxing out the basic melee and ranged units then put the remainder into Soh's tactical combat options. It let me get the most out of the cheapest options as well as provide a resource reserve if I wanted to indulge in more experimental configurations.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/kunitsu-gami-path-of-the-goddess-unit-upgrade-screen.jpg?itok=GEU0pUJ0 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/kunitsu-gami-path-of-the-goddess-unit-upgrade-screen.jpg?itok=h3W0SPcI 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>I maxed this guy so fast, and it was a great long-term investment.</figcaption></figure><p>Musubi and crystals can also be earned through some light base management. Completing a level unlocks a purified version of it on the world map. These are hub areas where you can assign villagers to different renovation projects like fixing up a shrine or restoring destroyed jizo statues. These projects finish when you complete a certain number of levels. Because of this, you are encouraged to check back in each area, setting up new assignments and collecting rewards.</p>
<p>What stops these sections from becoming a tedious slog is the presentation. It's the game expressing the Shinto belief of cherishing nature as well as showing the clear progress you're having in restoring order.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/kunitsu-gami-path-of-the-goddess-raikubo-boss-.jpg?itok=f5GJZPnd 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/kunitsu-gami-path-of-the-goddess-raikubo-boss-.jpg?itok=ORjUknaF 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>I honestly just wanted to get this fight over with.</figcaption></figure><h2><em>Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess</em> Review – The Same Tale Told Once More</h2>
<p>If there is an area where <em>Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess</em> is lacking, it is in narrative storytelling. Gameplay-wise, the campaign is well-paced and packed with twists and turns. But in terms of story and character, it is mostly wordless cutscenes.</p>
<p>It mostly works thanks to the game's dedication to sensation. Everything from the kaleidoscopic art direction to the expressive dancing performance capture to the moody acoustic soundtrack is truly elevating. It is a vibe-driven experience, and the vibes are strong.</p>
<p>Just how rewarding is this gameplay? Upon finishing the story, New Game Plus mode unlocked, and I immediately started it. That is a testament to the craftsmanship and care Capcom put into this title, and I'm hoping it is the start of a new series.</p>

<p>A barebones story and some annoying boss fights aside, <em>Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess</em> is a bold, confident combination of fast-paced action and exciting tactical management. If you love action or strategy, this game is a must-play. Check it out.</p>

<p>
Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess is light on overt storytelling, but packed with satisfying, entertaining action strategy gameplay. It's worth a look. (<a href="https://techraptor.net/review-score-policy">Review Policy</a>)

<p>Fallout: London is the long-awaited and highly anticipated game-sized mod for Fallout 4 that has been in development for several years. Following the release of the Fallout 4 next-gen update in April, it was announced by the ‘FOLON’ team that the super-sized mod would be delayed indefinitely owing to uncertainties and inevitable conflicts in the files. </p>



<p>Now, more bad news has surfaced, with the team confirming that anyone with an Epic Games Store version of Fallout 4 <strong>will not </strong>be able to play Fallout: London.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-at-least-it-s-coming">At Least It’s Coming</h2>



<p>Days ago, Team FOLON announced that, to play Fallout: London, users will need to ‘rollback’ their version of Fallout 4, dropping the next-gen update that Bethesda Game Studios deployed in April. This is because the upgrade is ‘inherently flawed’ and not compatible with the mod.</p>



<p>Now, <a href="https://www.vg247.com/fallout-london-gog-confirms-no-epic-store-at-launch" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the crew has stated</a> that anyone with an Epic Games Store version of Fallout 4 cannot access the mod at all. This is because the platform doesn’t have a rollback feature for updates – the version you’ve got is the only version you <strong>can </strong>get. This was further explained by a GOG spokesperson, who took the time to highlight why PC-based digital storefronts should offer this feature.</p>



<p>That’s another point – Fallout: London is only obtainable through GOG. It’s not being listed on Nexus Mods because it’s just too large, equalling some 30 GB in size.</p>



<p>Presently, the Fallout 4 mega-mod is being tested by GOG before it’s released worldwide. Will you be installing it?</p>

                <p>Pokemon Legends: Arceus is one of the Nintendo Switch exclusives that only receives meaningful discounts once or twice each year. Typically, this means waiting for Amazon Prime Day and Black Friday. Well, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/amazon-prime-day-deals/">Prime Day 2024</a> is practically here (July 16-17), and <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fshop-links.co%2F1813567614206032083%3Fu1%3Dsubid_value&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fpokemon-legends-arceus-is-rarely-discounted-but-you-can-grab-it-for-40-right-now%2F1100-6505106%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Best Buy's Black Friday in July Sale</a> features a <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fshop-links.co%2F1847965185512278434%3Fu1%3Dsubid_value&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fpokemon-legends-arceus-is-rarely-discounted-but-you-can-grab-it-for-40-right-now%2F1100-6505106%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">handful of Switch-exclusive games for $40</a>, including <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fshop-links.co%2F1847965138186147021%3Fu1%3Dsubid_value&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fpokemon-legends-arceus-is-rarely-discounted-but-you-can-grab-it-for-40-right-now%2F1100-6505106%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Pokemon Legends: Arceus</a>, through July 17.</p><p>When it launched in early 2022, Arceus marked the first big change for the series in years. Instead of roaming around challenging gym leaders, you’re set free in a sprawling world filled with Pokemon--many of which you can catch without entering combat. You can also discover a handful of mountable Pokemon that make it easy to get around the striking landscapes of Sinnoh. Our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/pokemon-legends-arceus-review-what-pokemon-is-evolving/1900-6417818/" data-ref-id="1900-6417818">Pokemon Legends: Arceus review</a> gave it an 8/10, praising it for taking risks that help breathe new life into the long-running series.</p><p>“Though it's a spin-off, Pokemon Legends: Arceus isn't lending the Pokemon trappings to an entirely different set of mechanics like the Mystery Dungeon or Stadium series," wrote critic Steve Watts. “Instead, this game reimagines Pokemon's core mechanics--finding and catching Pokemon and battling with them--within the new context of exploring vast 3D open spaces. The result is sometimes messy and doesn't always work, but its distinct qualities set it apart from the core series and ultimately elevate it.”</p><p>A sequel, dubbed <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pokemon-legends-z-a-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6521882/" data-ref-id="1100-6521882">Pokemon Legends Z-A</a>, is expected to release in 2025.</p><p>As mentioned, Arceus isn't the only Nintendo Switch exclusive discounted during Best Buy's sale; it's just the one that we see deals for the least.

The only question is: Will people be willing to spend $40 for a multiplayer-only shooter in the year 2024? </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196049" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="This Modern Warfare 3 Gameplay Feature Spices Up A Weak Campaign" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="134" data-playlist="196049,196653,196909" data-current="196049"><div><p>This Modern Warfare 3 Gameplay Feature Spices Up A Weak Campaign</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196049/196049_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196049/196049_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196049/196049_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196049/196049_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21580.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Over the weekend, a bunch of people got to play <em>Concord</em>—PlayStation’s upcoming 5v5 hero shooter—for the first time via a new beta. Usually, multiplayer betas are fun marketing demos to get people even more excited for your big new game a few weeks or months before launch. But for <em>Concord</em>, which arrives in August on PS5 and PC, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/concord-dev-respond-reveal-trailer-backlash-playstation-1851564299&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/concord-dev-respond-reveal-trailer-backlash-playstation-1851564299">the situation feels very different</a></span>. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/concord-playstation-5-pc-state-of-play-reaction-reddit-1851516496&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/concord-playstation-5-pc-state-of-play-reaction-reddit-1851516496">When Concord was first unveiled in May</a></span>, its trailer was negatively compared to <em>Guardians of the Galaxy</em>,<em>&nbsp;</em>while the confirmation that it was a PVP-only game did little to get people excited. So, the stakes were higher than normal for this first online beta. This is <em>Concord’s </em>first real ( and maybe only) chance to win people over and change the conversation around the FPS before launch. And while I’m not sure everyone will be convinced that <em>Concord </em>is good, I’m happy to say that, yes, it’s a damn fine shooter.<br></p><p><em>Overwatch</em> + <em>Destiny </em>with a sprinkle of <em>Call of Duty</em> is the easiest and laziest way to describe <em>Concord </em>to other people who play games. But it’s accurate. <em>Concord</em>—which is set in a brand-new sci-fi universe filled with aliens, mercenaries, and 5v5 arenas—features a large roster of colorful and distinct characters who all play differently ala <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-anniversary-reddit-review-competitive-rank-1850896550&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-anniversary-reddit-review-competitive-rank-1850896550"><em>Overwatch</em></a></span>. It also has slightly floaty (in a good way) movement and lots of wild abilities and powers, just like <em>Destiny</em>. And finally, sprinting, shooting, and map design feel very <em>Call of Duty</em> (also in a good way).</p><h2 id="h16911"><a id=""></a>So many heroes to choose from...</h2><p>In the beta I mostly played two game modes: Team Deathmatch and a mode which was basically <em>Call of Duty</em>’s “Kill Confirmed” where you kill people, pick up their tags, and try not to die or the enemy will grab your tags.</p><p>The first thing that struck me about <em>Concord </em>as I played these two modes was just how nice it felt to move around and shoot other players. <em>Concord’s </em>action is extremely snappy and smooth, so I always felt in control no matter who I was playing or what I was doing. It made hopping over obstacles to get a better angle or enemies or running away to fight another day a lot of fun.</p><p>The next thing I fell in love with about <em>Concord </em>was how all of its various characters or Freegunners felt different. I don’t really remember their names—during combat, I’d shout out nicknames like “Monkey Man” and “Spy Robot” to my brother—but they all provided a unique experience. If I wanted to be a slow, big, hard-to-kill tank I could choose the giant yellow robot with a vacuum canon that sucks up bullets. If I wanted to be a fast and nimble damage dealer I could pick the alien-elf lady with her SMG and zip around the map like a maniac. </p><p>Sure, plenty of hero shooters offer their own stable of characters with unique skills and roles, but here it feels like <em>Concord</em> wants its Freegunners be more distinct to the point that I assume some people will call the game unbalanced or unfair. (“Why can that character mantle and run around but I can’t?”) The thing is, this ended up making the game a lot more fun as it forced teammates to work together and Concord’s smartly designed UI and gameplay meant that I was constantly doing cool shit with randos—like trapping enemy players behind a magic wall while someone wiped them out with a grenade.<br></p><p> My personal favorite was Daw, a medic with an assault rifle, unlimited healing pads, and a powerful bubble shield. During matches, I’d often cover an area with health pads—which stick around when you die—turning a spot in the map into “Heal City.” However, Daw can be countered, like all the characters in <em>Concord</em>, by shooting the healing pads and prioritizing the medic gunner in fights. </p><p>One thing that did feel off in <em>Concord </em>was some of the maps. They were a bit too big or empty for the 5v5 fights that make up the sci-fi shooter’s foundation. I’m not sure if this can be fixed before launch or if players will get better at traversing the maps over time and make them feel less sparse, but for now, it feels like each map I played could have lost a few of its hallways and rooms and been better off for it. </p><p>Now, with all those positive words out of the way (and one complaint about maps) it’s time to talk about the elephant in the spaceship: <em>Concord</em>’s $40 price tag. </p><h2 id="h16912"><a id=""></a><em>Concord</em> is a hard sell in 2024</h2><p>As good as <em>Concord </em>is, I’m not sure this kind of game can work in 2024. There are so many good free-to-play PVP games out there right now that aren’t exclusive to PS5 and PC. Why would someone spend $40 to play a new one? I’m not sure. </p><p>Even worse, <em>Concord </em>doesn’t include—at least not at launch—any kind of PvE horde mode or co-op campaign. It’s unlikely to ship with a map maker or <em>Fortnite</em>-like creative mode, either. It just offers a 5V5 PVP shooter experience and...that’s it. I’m just not sure how many people are going to pay a premium for that when they can get similar experiences in other games for free.</p><p>Sure, those other games contain <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-season-8-orisa-mythic-skin-1851055727&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-season-8-orisa-mythic-skin-1851055727">tons of microtransactions</a></span> and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-battle-pass-shop-skins-rewards-coins-1849673687&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-battle-pass-shop-skins-rewards-coins-1849673687">often lock new</a></span> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-prereview-roundup-free-hero-shooter-grind-1849601813&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-prereview-roundup-free-hero-shooter-grind-1849601813">characters behind grinds</a></span>, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/concords-monetised-content-will-be-exclusively-cosmetic-firewalk-says/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/concords-monetised-content-will-be-exclusively-cosmetic-firewalk-says/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">something <em>Concord’s </em>devs promise won’t be the case</a></span> in the upcoming sci-fi shooter. All new maps, game modes, and characters will be included for free in future updates. That’s great! But I worry <em>Concord</em> won’t get many future updates if it doesn’t develop a large playerbase. </p><p>And while I get that Sony is trying to pull off another<em> Helldivers 2</em> with Concord—charging a premium and not cramming in annoying in-app purchases—I’m not convinced it will work as well this time around. Hopefully, I’m wrong. Because if I am, then <em>Concord </em>will live on for many years and I’ll get to keep playing it and having a great time. If not well, at least we had some fun in the beta. </p><p><em>Concord </em>launches on PS5 and PC on August 23. Players can check out its second beta weekend, which is open to all, and starts on July 19 and ends on July 22. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
As Fallout 4's massive Fallout: London mod nears its release, distributor GOG has moved to clear up some compatibility questions. The company has confirmed Fallout: London will work with versions of Fallout 4 bought on GOG and Steam, but not those purchased on the Epic Games Store, as the latter doesn't currently support a key feature needed to get it running.
</p>
<p>
If you're not up to date on its progress, Fallout: London - which, as its name suggests, enables players to quest around a post-apocalyptic open-world version of the UK's capital - has hit a few snags on the road to its release. Specifically, developer Team Folon has run into issues getting it to work with Fallout 4's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-4-free-next-gen-update-finally-arrives-this-month">recently released next-gen update</a>.
</p>
<p>
Team Folon made the decision to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-4s-next-gen-update-delays-the-release-of-dlc-sized-fan-mod-fallout-london">delay Fallout: London</a> back in April, anticipating the mod might run into "complications" when Bethesda's next-gen update arrived - and the decision proved wise. Last week, after some testing, the developer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/youll-need-to-downgrade-fallout-4s-next-gen-version-to-play-that-massive-fallout-london-mod">confirmed</a> Fallout 4's next-gen update simply "isn't stable enough" to run Fallout: London right now, and that the mod would be shipping with a downgrader to revert Fallout 4 to an older version.

<p>
We already knew Fallout: London's downgrader would work with the GOG version of Fallout 4, given GOG is distributing the mod (its massive size meant it was too large to host on Nexus Mods), but questions remained about versions of the game purchased on other PC stores - which GOG has now addressed.
</p>
<p>
In a <a href="https://www.vg247.com/fallout-london-gog-confirms-no-epic-store-at-launch">statement provided to VG247</a>, a spokesperson reiterated Fallout: London will work with the GOG version of Fallout 4 and also confirmed it'll be compatible with the Steam release - via a manual downgrade or using a downgrading tool that's current "in progress". However, Epic-distributed copies of Fallout 4 won't work with Fallout: London, given the Epic Store doesn't support the crucial ability to rollback to earlier versions of games.
</p>
<p>
There is, however, some hope Epic owners will be able to get involved eventually. Team Folon has already confirmed it's planning to update Fallout: London to work with Fallout 4's next-gen patch just as soon as Bethesda has got it in a more stable shape.
</p>
<p>
As for when Steam and GOG players can play Fallout: London, that's still TBC. Team Folon recently said "the end is in sight", but that the mod would first need to pass GOG's quality-assurance checks. "Once they've completed the process of double-checking that Fallout: London and its installer work on all supported machines," it wrote, "we should be good to go."

Well the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/steam-spring-sale-igf-2024-narrative-bundle-venba-1851345783&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/steam-spring-sale-igf-2024-narrative-bundle-venba-1851345783" data-vtas-click="self:InlineUrl:inline-url-postbody">Independent Games Festival</a></span>’s Celebration Days is here to change your mind.<br></p><p>The GDC-based indie awards show is hosting its own impressive sale on Steam until July 20th, and it’s giving you a chance to get some of the best indie games around. That includes classics like <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dear-esther-the-kotaku-review-5884520&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dear-esther-the-kotaku-review-5884520"><em>Dear Esther</em></a></span>, and even this year’s stunning <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/1000xresist-indie-narrative-time-travel-impressions-1851466481&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/1000xresist-indie-narrative-time-travel-impressions-1851466481" data-vtas-click="self:InlineUrl:inline-url-postbody"><em>1000xRESIST</em></a></span>. And don’t worry, if your wallet is still hurting from the summer sale; you can still peruse the myriad demos on offer during IGF Celebration Days. </p><p>To help you make sense of all the games you can get on discount, here are nine titles we think you shouldn’t miss.</p></div></div><div><p>This narrative cooking game has a runtime of under two hours, but it packs an emotional punch. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/1491670/Venba/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1491670/Venba/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Venba</em></a></span> focuses on the story of an immigrant family from India trying to make a life for themselves in Toronto. That includes a father who works a boring office job he hates, a young boy born in Toronto who is ashamed of his culture, and a mother who can’t quite figure out how to fit in and holds on to her past through cooking.</p><p>The mother is the titular <em>Venba</em>, and you spend the game playing a series of cooking minigames that produce delicious-looking traditional Tamil cuisine. It all made my mouth water. Through these interactive sections and dialogue-heavy cutscenes, <em>Venba</em> paints a deeply emotional story about the struggle of an immigrant family, and how food acts as a representation of culture that we can hold on to and pass on to the next generation. Be warned, you’ll probably want to buy some Indian take-out after playing this.</p></div><div><p>I’ll be honest, this is just an excuse to tell you to buy my favorite game of this year so far. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/1491670/Venba/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1491670/Venba/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>1000xRESIST</em></a></span> is only slightly discounted, but still worth a buy. </p><p><em>1000xRESIST </em>is a sci-fi narrative adventure with shades of <em>NieR </em>and <em>13 Sentinels: Aegis Rim</em>. More than anything, it’s a story about the Asian diaspora and generational trauma. As a member of the last society on earth, you have the power to dig through your god’s memories—experiences that reveal a complex young girl forced into the role of messiah and god. <em>1000xRESIST</em> feels so confident and stylish in its aesthetic and narrative presentation, creating something unique that you should experience for yourself. I promise it is worth it.</p></div><div><p>One part deck builder and one part visual novel, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/1340480/The_Cosmic_Wheel_Sisterhood/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1340480/The_Cosmic_Wheel_Sisterhood/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>The Cosmic Wheel Sisterhood</em></a></span><em> </em>was one of 2023’s standout indie titles. Its fascinating world is populated with unique characters, like protagonist Fortuna, a fortune-telling witch serving out a thousand-year sentence for predicting the collapse of her own coven. Fortuna summons a demon to help her out of her situation and gains the ability to create her own tarot deck. </p><p>Building cards takes the form of an MS paint-like interface that makes each player’s deck uniquely their own. As former friends and foes visit Fortuna, she reads each person their fortune—something you have some sway over, which adds weight to every decision.</p></div><div><p>If you enjoy a walking sim, then you probably want to give <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/520720/Dear_Esther_Landmark_Edition/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/520720/Dear_Esther_Landmark_Edition/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Dear Esther</em></a></span> a look, considering it’s in many ways responsible for the modern genre. Released in 2012, the game drops you onto a gorgeous but seemingly abandoned island with little in the way of a goal. As you walk around, you uncover bits of information about a small cast of characters you’ll never actually meet. </p><p>The game is a somber and meditative experience, one that ties together its threads into a fuzzy story about the unhappinesses we experience in life. What works so well about <em>Dear Esther</em> is how its narrative becomes less clear the deeper you go, forcing you to make your own conclusions about what is going on. And while the game’s overall vibes might make you worry it could tip over into horror, this really is just a walk… even if you see something mysterious in the distance.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="k3aacllnqzcttcds7p4r" data-recommend-id="image://k3aacllnqzcttcds7p4r" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The player grabs a turquoise-haired woman's boobs and text reads &quot;THE SWIMMER: Pay more attention to them, please.&quot;" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The player grabs a turquoise-haired woman's boobs and text reads &quot;THE SWIMMER: Pay more attention to them, please.&quot;" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Love Conquers All Games</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="k3aacllnqzcttcds7p4r" data-recommend-id="image://k3aacllnqzcttcds7p4r" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The player grabs a turquoise-haired woman's boobs and text reads &quot;THE SWIMMER: Pay more attention to them, please.&quot;" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>The best part about the erotic visual novel <em>Ladykiller in a Bind</em> is how unabashedly queer and unconventional it is. The protagonist of <em>Ladykiller in a Bind</em> is a woman crossdressing as her twin brother, who then proceeds to seduce the men and women around her into some steamy BDSM scenes.<br></p><p>What makes <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/560000/Ladykiller_in_a_Bind/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/560000/Ladykiller_in_a_Bind/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Ladykiller in a Bind</em></a></span>’s premise work so well is its writing. The game delivers its sexyness, its humor, and its seriousness with a deft hand, resulting in fascinating characters that make the seductions so much more involving. While the game bills itself as an erotic comedy, it’s also a caring and celebratory showcase of unconventional sex and gender, with a high respect for consent. </p></div></div><div><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/1677770/The_Case_of_the_Golden_Idol/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1677770/The_Case_of_the_Golden_Idol/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>The Case of the Golden Idol</em></a></span> is a game all about solving a series of progressively complex murders and other crimes. It starts with what appears to be as simple as a single death, but with tendrils that spread out into a grand conspiracy over decades. Each case is presented in the form of a snapshot of a scene, where you can see all the people at the exact moment of a crime and must, through tough detective work, put together what actually happened. </p><p>This is done through a Mad-Libs-esque book that has you plugging in answers that explain the scene. For example, if you are able to discover the name of a suspicious character by reading a contract they signed, then you could plug that name into a sentence accusing them of being the killer. The experience takes a lot of logical reasoning and deductive work and a notebook is a necessity. You might struggle at times, but finally cracking a case is a feeling that never gets old.</p></div><div><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/2103680/Mediterranea_Inferno/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2103680/Mediterranea_Inferno/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Mediterranea Inferno</em></a></span> is a visual novel with a lot going on. It has a psychedelic art style that is mesmerizing to look at, telling a story about the Covid pandemic, queerness, and figuring out identity. Following three friends who are reuniting for the first time since lockdown started, the game takes place during a dreamlike summer vacation that quickly blurs the lines between memory, imagination, and reality. </p><p><em>Mediterranea Inferno</em> is one of the best pieces of media about how an entire generation of youth lost years of their lives to a global pandemic, and the unique trauma that leaves behind. So often the game’s characters just laze about as if nothing will ever happen, and who can blame them? For so long, their lives have been stuck in limbo.</p></div><div><p>As the name suggests, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/1677770/The_Case_of_the_Golden_Idol/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1677770/The_Case_of_the_Golden_Idol/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>A Short Hike</em></a></span>’s objective is to complete a journey to the top of a mountain. Along the way you’ll encounter loveable locals, all with their own little tasks they need help with and stories for you to fall into. Rendered in a low-fi take on Animal Crossing’s cute aesthetic, <em>A Short Hike</em> wraps a touching story about growing up and the realities of life and death into a short, sweet package.</p></div><div><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/1223500/Umurangi_Generation/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1223500/Umurangi_Generation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Umurangi Generation</em></a></span> works as a great companion piece to <em>Mediterranea Inferno</em>, both of which are games about dealing with the Covid pandemic and feelings of being lost. For the cast of <em>Umurangi Generation</em>, the world is quite literally about to end, and every action towards living feels like a last radical form of protest. The game is also about documenting the lead-up to the end of the world, a photography game that tasks you with exploring its pre-apocalyptic world and sneaking into areas to take pictures of every last detail. </p><p>There’s a dissonance to the photography you’re tasked with, as you wonder who you are even documenting things for, but still you’re able to find pockets of joy and love. As well as being a commentary on the mishandling of a global pandemic, <em>Umurangi Generation</em> also seeks to be a piece of decolonialist art. The game takes place in New Zealand, and heavily features Māori culture and language as part of its themes of protest against the remnants of colonial powers that exist today. All of these many pieces of <em>Umurangi Generation</em> are pulled together by stunning art, making the end of the world an eerie delight to get lost in.</p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Last week, The Finals received a significant update with patch 3.4. The update was available immediately for those on PlayStation 5 and PC. However, those playing on Xbox were left in the cold as the new patch for The Finals isn’t available to them.</p>



<p>Days later, developer Embark is apologizing for the issues while not having an answer as to when Xbox players will get update 3.4 of The Finals.</p>



<p>“We’re currently working together with Microsoft on the situation that’s blocking the 3.4 release on Xbox,” Oscar from Embark said in the game’s official Discord. </p>



<p>“I currently don’t have an ETA for when we will be able to release, but as soon as I learn anything I will share it will all of you. We’re super sorry for this lenghty delay, and can only ask that you’re patient with us as we work through it.”</p>



<p>Update 3.4 of The Finals <a href="https://www.reachthefinals.com/patchnotes/340" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">includes a number of balancing changes</a> to the game as well as party chat while in the main menu and shorter wait times to get into games.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/mortal-kombat-1-trailer-reveals-dlc-fighter-takeda-takahashi/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The latest trailer for <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-mortal-kombat-1-patch-adds-60fps-option-on-pc-but-not-for-online-matches/">Mortal Kombat 1</a> has been released, and in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqZwGZBx-t8">this trailer</a>, we get our first glimpse at the DLC fighter, Takeda Takahashi. Luckily, players won't have long to wait until the release of this new character.</p>
<p>Those with the Kombat Pack can try out the new DLC fighter from July 23. However, for those who don't own the Kombat Pack, you will have to wait until July 30 for their full availability. Alongside the release of Takeda Takahashi, a brand new Kameo fighter is also available. Ferra is the latest Kameo fighter to join Mortal Kombat 1 and has plenty of supportive combos that can aid you in battle against your foes.</p>
<p>If you aren't familiar with Takeda Takahashi, he made his first debut in Mortal Kombat X, where you find out that this character was raised as a Yakuza. His cousin Kenshi was also raised in this lifestyle but didn't enjoy it as much as Takeda did. Takeda was chosen to help combat Kenshin and end his torment against his masters.</p>
<p>Takeda Takahashi joins Mortal Kombat 1 as the final character to be released in the Kombat Pack. Additionally, this brand new character alongside Ferra will be available to try out and play during the Evolution Championship Series (EVO), where event attendees can try out these new characters for the first time before they are officially available to all players.</p>
<p>If you have yet to get your hands on the Kombat Pack with the other DLC fighters, such as Ermac, <a href="https://wccftech.com/how-to/mortal-kombat-1-homelander-guide-fatalities-strategy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Homelander</a>, and Quan Chi, you can still purchase it at any time. This will allow you to get early access to Takeda Takahashi should you purchase it before his full release on July 30.</p>
<p>In the trailer, we see Takeda Takahashi utilize some of his most commonly used weapons in the previous iterations of Mortal Kombat. Additionally, he appears in the Mortal Kombat comics, where he uses other weapons that aren't used in the game.</p>
<p><iframe title="Mortal Kombat 1 – Official Takeda Gameplay Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dqZwGZBx-t8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Takeda is seen utilizing a bladed Lasher, leading to brutal attacks against his opponents. He has some great combos out of the gate and can even use an ability where he grapples to the ceiling to then attack his opponent. In addition to the lasher, he has projectiles that he can throw at the opponent, staggering them. When he isn't using his lasher as a weapon, he fights against his opponent with his fists.</p>
<p>Ferra has fantastic frost abilities that help seal the deal in a fight. For example, they are seen putting up a temporary ice wall in the trailer, leaving the opponent cornered and stuck against it.</p>
<p>Are you looking forward to this new Mortal Kombat 1 DLC fighter?</p>

Though he refrains from giving away exactly how the two will differ, Takeuchi does claim that the show is partly an original story, though it does appear as if it’ll mostly adapt the larger points of the established narrative. For those wondering about the authenticity of it all, he states, “The game developers at Sega told me the show is faithful to the games and that my performance was faithful to Kiryu, so that’s enough for me!”</p><p>Speaking of, Takeuchi seems to be taking some liberties with the character of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/fathers-day-video-game-dads-daddies-joel-kratos-bowser-1851541054/slides/6&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/fathers-day-video-game-dads-daddies-joel-kratos-bowser-1851541054/slides/6">Kazuma Kiryu</a></span>. Kiryu has, over the many years, become a beloved and storied character. His life is one of the most vividly realized spans of a character’s being in all of video games. That’s an <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/total-recall-like-a-dragon-infinite-wealth-yakuza-1851289847&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/total-recall-like-a-dragon-infinite-wealth-yakuza-1851289847">imposing legacy</a></span> to live up to, and while Takeuchi definitely wants to honor it as best he can, he also wants to take this opportunity to steer Kiryu—whom he describes as a”strong, well-built, heroic character” that is “starved for love”—with a different vision.</p><p>“I have great respect for the feelings of the fans, but when I play a character, I have to express them in my own way, so I can’t pay attention to the preconceptions of others…There’s no point in trying to surpass the original game; rather I wanted to show respect to the games while making something new as an artist.”</p><p>Despite that, Takeuchi is fully embodying Kiryu, and that includes doing his own fight scenes, as well as developing his fighting style. Takeuchi seemingly found inspiration from the games and began by honing Kiryu’s approach to combat after his time in prison, where he’s sent for ten years in the first <em>Like a Dragon </em>game. From there, he appears to have worked backwards to make something that’ll presumably look and feel sloppier and less disciplined. He claims, “When the story starts in 1995, Kiryu’s fighting style is still rough and not very effective, because he has not formally learned martial arts and he is just using his instincts.”</p><p>From that point on, he will grow as a fighter, which will be evident when the show jumps forward to 2005. The first <em>Like a Dragon </em>game follows Kiryu during two distinct periods of his life, first in the 90s and then after his release from a decade-long stint in prison in 2005, so it’s only natural that he should come across as a different combatant and person depending on the era. To that extent, Takeuchi will also look and sound different depending on the time certain scenes take place. In the 90s, he mentions playing Kiryu with the “kind of energy you only get on the verge of your twenties,” before then “subtract[ing]” those youthful emotions when we touch base with him in 2005.</p><p>The most tantalizing aspect of the show, though, is how it will portray Kamurocho, the fictional district that the games take place in, which takes influence from Kabukicho, an actual red-light district in Japan. Kamurocho is a deeply realized setting, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/yakuza-like-a-dragon-ishin-majima-kiryu-localization-1850263200&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/yakuza-like-a-dragon-ishin-majima-kiryu-localization-1850263200">filled with both oddballs</a></span> as well as recurring figures in Kiryu’s life that have followed him through the decades. Kamurocho also changes extensively throughout the course of the series, which comes as no surprise considering the games span <em>just about </em>50 years.</p><p>According to Takeuchi, the show, which filmed on sets rather than on-location, a lot of attention seems to have been paid to the place and its people. “Kamurocho in 1995 is a lively, warm, sparkling place filled with energy,” whereas 2005’s version of the district is much moodier and “the atmosphere is colder” to reflect the passing of laws criminalizing Kiryu’s way of life, shifts in attitude and culture, and how he feels “out of step with the people around him.”</p><p>Throughout these changes, <em>Like A Dragon: Yakuza</em>’s director Masaharu Take seems to have captured “the flavor of Kamurocho” by being as detailed as Ryu Ga Gotoku Studios, the developers of the games. Takeuchi says that one of those details was the casting of background actors that really brought the setting to life. “The set was so detailed,” he said, “from each passerby to every corner of its streets, that I felt like I had traveled back in time. It didn’t feel like a set at all. Yes, there is some CG enhancement, but I think it was the people who really brought it to life. You can’t fake that.”</p><p>It seems to me that the people involved in this show <em>get</em> what has made the <em>Like a Dragon </em>series so deeply beloved over the years. It’s always had cinematic qualities that’ll likely translate wonderfully to a TV adaptation, but the games’ deep sense of place, and your ability to reach out and feel it all as Kiryu, has also played a tremendous part in the franchise’s ascent. Moreover, Kiryu is a complicated character in an evolving world, and a show feels like an apt way to adapt that story. Everything that Takeuchi has said leads me to believe that this team knows what it’s doing with this property, and I’m now positively buzzing for this series.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
