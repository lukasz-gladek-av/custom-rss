            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/guild-wars">Guild Wars</a> Reforged, a big update to 2005 MMORPG Guild Wars that's designed to make it a lot more convenient to play on modern hardware, is set to hit Steam on December 3rd. Steam Deck verification, modern controller support, and an interface revamp are among the tweaks developers ArenaNet and 2weeks have made, with the possibility of further "improvements" down the road being teased.</p>

<p>"We believe that even with all the advancements and innovations of the last two decades, Guild Wars has a lot to offer: an enchanted world of limitless adventure, a deep and flexible skill-based combat system, PvE and PvP challenges of all types, and more," ArenaNet wrote in Reforged's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1284210/view/634572213702362037?l=english">Steam announcement</a>. "Guild Wars Reforged begins with a series of updates to Guild Wars that will be completely free to existing players and make it easier than ever for new players to experience it all firsthand."</p>
<p>Reforged, which'll be free to folks who already own the original Guild Wars, lumps Prophecies, Factions, and Nightfall together into one package at the new price of $19.99 / whatever the your currency equivalent turns out to be. The aforementioned Steam Deck verification, an interface with larger text options, plus support for controller and high DPI displays come in that revamped box. There's a new quest tracking system and on-screen guide to the controls.</p><p>It's also had a bit of a visual facelift with "dynamic sky bloom effects, new ambient occlusion, and lighting updates" designed to take advantage of modern graphics cards, while some revamped textures and positional audio support round things out. Well, for now at least. "Guild Wars Reforged isn't about a one-time update", ArenaNet wrote, adding that they see this as a "renewing our commitment to the game" with help from <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/new-studio-2weeks-to-focus-on-prototyping-and-bite-sized-games">2weeks</a>, a small studio some former ArenaNet staff formed last year.</p>
<p>"Beginning as a teenager, I’ve been involved with this franchise from the very start, collaborating with the original studio founders to create the world of Tyria," said 2weeks co-founder Brandon Dillon, who spent 11 years at ArenaNet and has since worked on the likes of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/grim-fandango-remastered">Grim Fandango Remastered</a> at Double Fine. "Partnering with ArenaNet to update and improve the player experience means the game can continue to be a beloved beacon for fans of multiplayer online RPGs for years to come."</p>
<p>It's nice to see Guild Wars getting some TLC <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/guild-wars-1-development-to-be-halted-automated">all these years on</a>, especially since sequel <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/guild-wars-2">Guild Wars 2</a>'s in our <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-mmos-mmorpgs">top MMOs list</a>. Plus, it's an excuse to go back and read some <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/guild-wars-4th-birthday-eric-flannum-interview">retro Guild Wars writings</a> from the founderfolk if you fancy.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-phantasmal-flames-charizard-chase-card-2000645074</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/every-chase-card-in-pok%C3%A9mon-tcg%E2%80%99s-phantasmal-flames-including-that-charizard.1356928/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The latest set in the <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-cards-available-journey-together-stock-1851772771">controversy-embroiled</a>&nbsp;<em>Pokémon TCG</em>, Phantasmal Flames, is now out. And, as is becoming traditional for a November release, contains a brand new Charizard card that’s going to drive even more people (and scalpers) to the hobby. In this case, it’s the beloved Mega Charizard X, the gigantic blue variant appearing in both a stunning Special Illustration Rare <em>and</em> in one of the new-fangled gold foils. And yes, both are already fetching ridiculous prices. But in a stark change, they’re the only two that are.</p> <p>I’m pleased to report that once again, if you’re actually able to find any packs to buy, Phantasmal Flames <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-mega-evolution-pull-rates-2000629165">continues Mega Evolution’s new-found generosity</a> when it comes to pull rates. Of the 55 packs we were kindly sent by The Pokémon Company, I pulled an extraordinary 24 ex or better cards, of which 13 were full art or better. Compared to the three year run of <em>Scarlet &amp; Violet</em> sets, this is a dramatic improvement, with pretty much a 50:50 chance of not getting what is derogatively known as a “dud pack.” (For those wanting to play the game, there’s no such thing as a dud pack, and of course it’s these people who are most hurt by the current <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-prismatic-evolutions-surging-sparks-sold-1851738920">year-long period of scarcity</a>.)</p>

 <p>However, the cost of this does very much appear to be the pull rates on Special Illustration Rares. As with Mega Evolution, Phantasmal Flames has made these most desirable cards extraordinarily unlikely to appear, with <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-mega-evolution-gold-cards-pull-rate-2000630564">the new iteration of gold foils proving farcically rare</a>. With Mega Evolutions, this drove prices to new, all-time highs, but in the first few days of Phantasmal Flames things don’t appear to be nearly so out of control. The Charizards are, of course, outrageously priced at $600 and $800 each, but we then see a <em>massive</em> drop for third place, with Dawn’s SIR going for $60. That’s a&nbsp;<em>very</em> normal price for an SIR, and in a pretty small set with only five of them to find, it suggests that people are simply ripping packs for the Zards and caring about little else.</p>

 <p>That becomes even more stark when you notice that fourth place goes to Mega Charizard X ex again, but this time in its much more common Ultra Rare form (I pulled one of these, as it happens) at around $57, the other four SIRs following for as little as $30. (Yes, $30 for a piece of cardboard remains ridiculous, but then I just spent&nbsp;<em>way</em> more than that on the Crown Zenith Leafeon VSTAR, so who am I to talk?)</p>

 <p>Is this a good sign that cards like the Mega Sharpedo ex and Rotom ex SIRs aren’t going for megabucks? Or is it, and I do worry it’s this, that the SIRs in Phantasmal Flames just aren’t that appealing? The art is wonderful on both of those examples, but Sharpedo is rarely at the top of anyone’s favorite Pokémon list, and there really are a lot of pretty Rotom cards already. Then there’s the complete mess of the Mega Lopunny ex (see the card in the gallery), and, well, that’s all of them. The more common (and thus always cheaper) Illustration Rares are where the truly wonderful art appears in this set, with a stunning Zacian, Piplup, Flygon, Wooper, Togedemaru, Ludicolo and Ambipom to find, most of them selling during the peak price of the opening week for under $10! Meowth is the only one of the IRs that’s caught on at around $30 (with Piplup managing an impressive $19).</p> <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-mega-evolution-cards-price-mega-lucario-gardevoir-hyper-rare-2000633650">Compare this with Mega Evolution</a>, where the tenth highest priced card was going for $50, and the SIRs fetching around $300 each, and it’s a striking shift. So, with all that said, click on for the cards you want to chase if you’re looking for value in Phantasmal Flames, but know that if you’re after the cards to play in a deck, most can be picked up in their basic form for under a dollar. (Even Mega Charizard X ex’s regular form “only” fetches about $5.) Again,&nbsp;<em>if</em> you can actually find packs to open.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>We approach the end of 2025, and the year has seen another ridiculous haul of great games. The Game Awards 2025 showcase will announce one winner from six glorious nominees, but we simply can’t overlook the four games that easily could’ve been included in the pool.</p>



<p>Awards and ceremonies are all subjective at the end of the day. Just like a review, the verdict is reached by either one person or a select panel of people. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-game-awards-2025-all-award-nominees/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Game Awards 2025</a> will congratulate its own GOTY winner, but you might have had your own favorite. Games like Hades 2 and Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 deserve their place on the nominee list.</p>



<p>In our opinion, some mentions go beyond the tag of being ‘honorable,’ and we’ve identified four prime candidates.</p>







<h2 id="h-best-the-game-awards-2025-goty-nominees-not-included">Best The Game Awards 2025 GOTY Nominees Not Included</h2>



<h3 id="h-blue-prince">Blue Prince</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Blueprints, get it? Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p>The roguelike and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-roguelites-all-time/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">roguelite</a> genres have been on fire the last few years. Games like Hades and Balatro have not only been nominated for awards, but they’ve won many of them. It feels like a bizarre oversight to have not included Blue Prince. <strong>It was the highest-rated game of the year for a while</strong>, and won over critics and fans with its unique hunt for the 46th room in an inherited house. The trick is that the house’s floors and plans reset every night.</p>



<p>You only have so many steps and resources to move around, and if you don’t do it in time, you start from scratch. But you uncover new items, the game opens up, more locations and secrets are discovered, and it’s a masterful roguelike. According to Metacritic, it’s the <strong>third-best new game in 2025</strong> (discounting the Switch 2 Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom ports) with a collective score of 92/100, so why wasn’t it included?</p>



<h3 id="h-dispatch">Dispatch</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Super in more ways than one. Credit to AdHoc Studio</figcaption></figure>



<p>A ‘Superhero&nbsp;workplace comedy’ sounds like a strange concept without context. It’s all the more impressive that AdHoc Studio’s new IP not only works, but <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dispatch-episodes-1-2-spoiler-free-review/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dispatch</a> crashed onto all screens with a triumphant superhero landing. The episodic title features an all-star cast of video game voice-over royalty, streamers, and even renowned stars, including <strong>Aaron Paul and Jeffrey Wright</strong>.</p>



<p>The intertwining narrative changes across all eight episodes. Your decision-making skills impact the story beats—similar to the Telltale Games formula—and there are also mini-games and other QTEs to break up the conversation and plot development. It’s also fun seeing the fun and different side of superheroes, with The Boys and Watchmen springing to mind. The late addition to 2025 has been instantly revered, but did it come too late for The Game Awards 2025?</p>



<h3 id="h-split-fiction">Split Fiction</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Hazelight Studios is unreal. Credit to Hazelight Studios</figcaption></figure>



<p>Josef Fares masterminded another co-op-only classic with Split Fiction. It carries on the immaculate work of It Takes Two by placing you and a friend into the shoes of Zoe and Mio. You experience a series of mini-games and creative gameplay mechanics at breakneck speed, giving you more variety than a family-sized picnic fruit basket.</p>







<p>It’s meticulously crafted, it looks gorgeous, and highlights the unbelievable work that Hazelight Studios continues to produce with each new game. It Takes Two won The Game Awards GOTY category in 2021, but Split Fiction—<strong>despite being the fourth-highest-rated game of 2025</strong>, according to Metacritic, with a score of 91 based on 100 critic reviews—doesn’t even get into the final 6 games. Go figure.</p>



<h3 id="h-ball-x-pit">Ball X Pit</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Say goodbye to your free time. Credit to Kenny Sun</figcaption></figure>



<p>It’s only fitting to finish off with a roguelite. The irresistible gameplay loop of ‘rogue’ games is none more evident than in Ball X Pit. Its curious name might confuse you, but there’s nothing ambiguous about its gameplay. Block-breaking games aren’t new, but not many try to build a full game around the concept, and to such an overt degree.</p>



<p>Each Ball X Pit game lasts 5-15 minutes. You move along the stage in semi-on-rails fashion, and you earn XP and power-ups as you play. Pickups give you choices, which determine your build for each run, and it leads to this great chase for OP playthroughs where you destroy enemies, crush bosses, and earn lots of resources toward your next effort. <strong>It’s been labeled as the ‘Balatro of 2025,’</strong> and this would be doing a disservice to Ball X Pit in some ways—it’s that good!</p>



<p>The Game Awards 2025 is sure to be another interesting ceremony with opinions, shocks, and much post-show discussion. Do you agree with any of our GOTY nominees who missed out?

<p>Xbox exclusives haven’t been a part of Game of the Year (GOTY) nominations since 2010, making it 15 years since one was nominated. </p>



<p>The latest list of nominees for The Game Awards 2025 is now <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-game-awards-2025-all-award-nominees/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">live</a>, with winners announced on December 11. However, as we wait for the award show to take place and a new GOTY to be crowned, players should know that no Xbox exclusives are making it to nominations, leaving them out of the running to win the prestigious award. </p>







<h2 id="h-xbox-exclusives-haven-t-been-nominated-for-goty-for-15-years">Xbox Exclusives Haven’t Been Nominated for GOTY for 15 Years</h2>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/xbox-exclusives-not-nominated-game-awards-game-of-the-year-since-2010/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">TheGamer</a>, Nick Marseil’s latest post on <a href="https://x.com/Nick_Marseil/status/1990481258615353466" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (formerly Twitter) reveals every GOTY nominee for The Game Awards from 2013 to today, categorising them as PlayStation, Nintendo, and Xbox Exclusives. PlayStation has had 15 games nominated, including titles like The Last of Us, Marvel’s Spider-Man, God of War, Death Stranding 2, and more. Nintendo has had 12 exclusives nominated, including Super Mario Odyssey, The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, Donkey Kong Bananza, and more. Xbox, as mentioned above, has had none. </p>



<p>The answer to when Xbox Exclusives were nominated for GOTY will not make the fans happy, as it was before The Game Awards ceremony even began. The last time Xbox exclusives were nominated for this award was through the Spike Video Game Awards, where Halo: Reach and Mass Effect 2 were nominated. However, none of these games won the award. </p>



<p>If you are wondering about the latest GOTY nominees for TGA 2025, the list includes: Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, Hollow Knight: Silksong, Donkey Kong Bananza, Death Stranding 2: On The Beach, Kingdom Come Deliverance 2, and Hades 2. Additionally, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 has <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-nominations-the-game-awards-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">broken a record</a> at TGA 2025. </p>

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/barkour-preview-a-mostly-doggone-good-stealth-time-so-far</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/barkour-preview-a-mostly-doggone-good-stealth-time-so-far.1356907/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Who isn’t a sucker for a dog game? Walking the show floor at the Games Industry Conference in Poznań, Wielkopolska, I immediately did a double take when I saw Barkour, a game about a dog secret agent. He’s not just cute and cuddling, he also has a gun and a grappling hook: I had to take this dog for a walk.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">You, of course, play as a dog in Barkour. You’re Agent T.H.U.N.D.E.R. (don’t ask me what it stands for, dogs can’t spell anyway), an all-around Good Boy who’s recruited off the streets into a secret dog spy organization, and trained to help them take down nefarious, cat-themed villains. He’s got a pretty robust kit to help him out: his nose can sense enemy locations and interactable items, he can overhear enemy conversations to get important intel, he can bark to lure enemies, pounce on them to knock them out, and drag their bodies into hiding with his teeth. He also has gadgets, including a back-mounted gun that can either use sleep darts to incapacitate or actual bullets to kill anyone who tries to fight him. The gadget wheel had loads of room for other tools, too, so I’m sure there’s more to come to turn Agent THUNDER into a full-blown spydog.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Barkour - Concept Art and Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">After a lengthy tutorial that introduces the new Agent (and the player) to his gadgets and spy abilities, the demo threw me into an early game mission, which sees our dog hero infiltrate a massive, overgrown, abandoned maze of a medieval castle to take down someone named “Van der Meow” who, with a name like that, clearly must be stopped. Van der Meow is located in the deepest inner sanctum of the castle, and is guarded by various locked doors, security cameras, and scary men with guns. I could sneak my way through, using my sniffer to track enemy locations, seeking cover in bushes, and quietly incapacitating guards with sleep darts before dragging their bodies into alcoves. Or, I could go in guns blazing, alerting the whole room to my presence and starting a proper firefight.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>I was quickly impressed with how much license Barkour gave me to find my own way and mess around within the world, to an almost sandboxy degree.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Mostly, I chose stealth, and I was quickly impressed with how much license Barkour gave me to find my own way and mess around within the world, to an almost sandboxy degree. The castle started out fairly linear, but quickly opened up into a winding maze of a place with multiple rooms and floors and a number of hidden pathways outside the castle walls, underground, up towers, in ceiling rafters above the dining hall, and behind locked doors. Barkour’s demo offered a surprising amount of freedom to simply figure things out, experiment, and seek out secrets. Instead of beelining it to my objective, I felt encouraged to puzzle out stealth pathways through multiple unnecessary rooms that were hiding secrets, like new treats or gadgets, on the other side. Diving down wells, digging holes, or trying out tricky little platforming sections that took me on narrow pathways up high towers generally rewarded me with with either a shortcut to somewhere I wanted to go or a prize of some kind.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Of course, I can smell a lot of heavily-armed guards standing between me and that exploration, so I make an effort to take them out one by one to afford myself safe passage. It would be trivial enough to just fire off sleep darts at every single guard and call it a day, but those are a limited resource that I can only recharge by physically tackling guards – a move that’s far more likely to set off alarms. So I spend a lot of the beginning of the demo skulking in shrubbery, waiting for a guard to wander by, barking to lure him close to me, sneak attacking to knock him out cold, and then dragging his body into the bushes before anyone can notice. That gives me a charge of the sleep dart, which I can then use to knock out the next guy, and so on.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It also seems like puzzles will play a part in Barkour, too, though most of what I ran into in the opening level was pretty simple. A lot of the puzzles involved listening in on guard conversations or exploring an area to get a code to unlock a door, or using my sniffer to find hidden buttons I needed to press. Several locations seemed to want me to bring specific items to them to activate something, like a fireplace wanting some logs that I never managed to track down. There was one puzzle later in the demo that involved identifying and tracking down several pieces of medieval weaponry all around the castle, but I struggled with this one a bit: it wanted a sword, and even though I could see swords all over the place, none of them were the exact interactable sword the puzzle wanted me to bring. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">I wasn’t quite as impressed with the combat, which still needs some fine tuning. I prefer playing games like this in full stealth-mode, but a few times I did slip up and alert guards to my presence. What followed was what feels like it should have been a challenging combat situation as guards surrounded me from all sides, alarms blared, and shots rang out. What actually happened is I ran literal circles around the guards, pouncing on top of them one after another to stun them and keep them from shooting me, all while infinitely firing my own back-mounted gun to whittle down their health. Rinse and repeat until they’re all dead. I can definitely see what Barkour is going for: the equal emphasis placed on both combat and stealth in the tutorial and gadgets you’re given suggests it wants either method to feel like a viable option. But just in the level I played, the combat was missing something, and I had far more fun with both the challenge and mechanics of stealth.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>In the level I played, the combat was missing something, and I had far more fun with both the challenge and mechanics of stealth.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">One note, just to preempt some concerns: Barkour’s free demo on Steam, which is the same one I played, was criticized when it first dropped due to the inclusion of AI voice acting. Following the criticisms, the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1920290?emclan=103582791474668669&amp;emgid=506216199297696056" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>developers announced</u></a> that they had removed the AI voices, which they said were only temporary, with plans to hire professionals for the full release. I mention this just because the version I played was the one with the AI voices removed, and thus it didn’t detract from my experience at all.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Overall, Barkour seems extremely promising, it just needs polish – especially the combat. I really enjoyed the openness of the level I played, with all the hidden puzzles and collectibles, and the wide variety of potential strategies to reach my objectives. A stealth game that also functions as a sandbox is a really neat idea, especially paired with such a silly, pup-based premise, and Barkour’s bones are looking real good. With a bit more time and testing, I’m feeling optimistic that the final release will be a doggone treat.</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/barkour-preview-a-mostly-doggone-good-stealth-time-so-far]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Where Winds Meet has seen two million players jump into the Wuxia fantasy in the first 24 hours of its global launch.</p>
<p>The news was shared by developer Everstone Studio and publisher NetEase Games, following the Chinese action-RPG's release earlier this week.</p>
<p>On Steam, the game has a peak concurrent player count of almost 194k. For comparison with other recent releases, this is far behind the all-time peaks of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/arc-raiders">Arc Raiders</a> (481,966) and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a> (747,440), but remains incredibly impressive for a game of this genre.</p>

<p>And while Where Winds Meet so far pales in comparison to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/black-myth-wukong">Black Myth: Wukong</a> on Steam (2.4 million concurrent player peak), it's already surpassed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/wuchang-fallen-feathers">Wuchang: Fallen Feathers</a> from earlier this year (131,518 concurrent player peak).</p>
<p>Where Winds Meet is also available on PS5 and mobile - on PS5, the game is among the best-sellers in the US, France, South Korea, and other countries.</p>
<p>The game is free-to-play, which usually attracts an initial surge of players, but there's also a sizable online multiplayer component to the game too that acts like an MMO, further contributing to those concurrent player numbers.</p>

<p>Where Winds Meet is one of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/how-black-myth-wukong-has-changed-the-game-for-chinese-developers">many Chinese action-RPGs releasing in the wake of the immensely popular Black Myth: Wukong</a>, with developers seeking similar success.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/marvel-cosmic-invasion-the-crew-motorfest-xbox-game-pass-november-2025/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/marvel-cosmic-invasion-the-crew-motorfest-and-more-head-to-xbox-game-pass-this-month.1356868/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Xbox has <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/11/18/xbox-game-pass-november-2025-wave-2/">announced the remaining games</a> heading to Xbox Game Pass for the back half of November 2025, and paired with the games that already joined the service this month, it makes November arguably the most stacked month Xbox Game Pass has had in 2025. An additional nine games are joining the service between today and December 1, including Marvel Cosmic Invasion and The Crew Motorfest.</p>



<p>Two of the nine games are day one arrivals into Game Pass, including the aforementioned Cosmic Invasion and Moonlighter 2: The Endless Vault, which is finally set to launch in early access after it was delayed <a href="https://wccftech.com/moonlighter-2-the-endless-vault-officially-set-to-launch-in-summer-2025/">from its initial summer 2025 release window</a>. The sequel to the action-adventure game that lets you lead a double life as a shopkeeper and a dangerous explorer is looking to build on the momentum of the original, which sold more than two million copies overall.</p>



<p>Besides the two-day-one launches, two of the other notable titles entering the service this month are the <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-says-the-crew-2-and-the-crew-motorfest-will-get-offline-modes/">latest entry in Ubisoft's popular driving series, The Crew Motorfest</a> and last year's action game from DON'T NOD, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/banishers-ghosts-of-new-eden-dont-nods-finest-action-game-yet/">Banishers: Ghosts of New Eden.</a> There are also two more releases from this year, including <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/revenge-of-the-savage-planet-review-funny-beautiful-and-tedious/">Revenge of the Savage Planet</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/lost-records-bloom-and-rage-missed-expectations-dont-nod-signs-deal-with-netflix/">Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage</a>.</p>



<p>Under Xbox's new tiered system for Game Pass, we know that most day-one releases will only be available to those at the top-tier Ultimate level subscription, but it's worth pointing out that in this batch of Game Pass additions, seven out of nine are only available to Game Pass Ultimate subscribers.</p>



<p>In fact, it's worth noting that none of the games entering the service today will be available to players at the lowest tier, Game Pass Essential. At least those players at the bottom tier aren't losing any games with the titles leaving the service this month.</p>



<p>Here's the full list of Xbox Game Pass games coming to the service for the rest of November 2025:</p>



<ul>
<li>Moonlighter 2: The Endless Vault - November 19 - PC - Game Pass Ultimate, PC Game Pass</li>



<li>Kulebra and the Souls of Limbo - November 19 - Cloud, Console, PC - Game Pass Premium and up</li>



<li>Revenge of the Savage Planet - November 19 - Cloud, PC, Xbox Series X/S - Game Pass Premium and up</li>



<li>Monsters are Coming! Rock &amp; Road - November 19 - PC - Game Pass Ultimate, PC Game Pass</li>



<li>The Crew Motorfest - November 20 - Cloud, Console, PC - Game Pass Ultimate, PC Game Pass</li>



<li>Banishers: Ghosts of New Eden - November 25 - Cloud, PC, Xbox Series X/S - Game Pass Premium and up</li>



<li>Kill It With Fire! 2 - November 25 - Cloud, Console, PC - Game Pass Premium and up</li>



<li>Marvel Cosmic Invasion - December 1 - Cloud, Console, PC - Game Pass Ultimate, PC Game Pass</li>



<li>Lost Records: Bloom &amp; Rage - December 2 - Cloud, PC, Xbox Series X/S - Game Pass Premium and up</li>
</ul>



<p>Lastly, as always, with games entering the service, there are games leaving. This month, on November 30, Game Pass subscribers will no longer have access to the following five games through their subscription:</p>



<ul>
<li>Barbie Project Friendship</li>



<li>Lords of the Fallen</li>



<li>Octopath Traveler</li>



<li>Octopath Traveler 2</li>



<li>SteamWorld Build</li>
</ul>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Today, NCSOFT subsidiary ArenaNet delivered a surprise announcement with Guild Wars Reforged, an updated version of the classic MMORPG that will be released on December 3.</p>



<p>The original game launched in April 2005 and established the studio originally founded by former Blizzard developers. Over the years, Guild Wars was played by more than nine million users, who spent over a billion hours in the fantasy world of Tyria. ArenaNet eventually released the sequel seven years later and has focused mainly on <a href="https://wccftech.com/guild-wars-2-visions-of-eternity-expansion-out-now-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Guild Wars 2</a> ever since, but a small fanbase remained loyal to the original.</p>



<p>Guild Wars Reforged is being co-developed with 2weeks, a small studio founded last year by former ArenaNet developers. Brandon Dillon, co-founder of 2weeks, said in a statement:</p>



<p><em>It’s a real treat to revisit the original Guild Wars. Beginning as a teenager, I’ve been involved with this franchise from the very start, collaborating with the original studio founders to create the world of Tyria. Partnering with ArenaNet to update and improve the player experience means the game can continue to be a beloved beacon for fans of multiplayer online RPGs for years to come.</em></p>



<p>Game Director Stephen Clarke-Willson added:</p>



<p><em>Even after two decades, we’re still passionate about improving the experience of the original Guild Wars for players. The game has a dedicated group of fans, and with this update to modernize the experience, we hope players new and old will find a reason to continue adventuring through Tyria together.</em></p>



<p>As mentioned in the headline, Guild Wars Reforged will deliver controller support, make the game Steam Deck verified, and also bring a host of graphic enhancements, such as high-DPI support for modern high-resolution monitors, new HD skill icons, rendering improvements including new antialiasing options, ambient occlusion, enhanced bloom, more font size options for game text, enhanced 3D environmental audio, and a new quest-tracker.</p>

<p>Reforged is free for existing users, though new users can get it via Steam or Windows PC for $19.99 with all the expansions (Prophecies, Factions, and Nightfall) included. </p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/tabletop/features/dust-to-damnation-legends-of-avantris-daggerheart-exploration-building-wild-west</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dust-to-damnation-legends-of-avantris-daggerheart-exploration-building-the-wild-west-and-keeping-things-simple.1356862/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Dust To Damnation is a new mini-campaign from the team at <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="6d404c6b-162e-45bc-be64-2ca3cd9efba5" href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/crooked-moon-review-incredibly-spooky-adventure-that-dms-will-love" rel="nofollow">Legends of Avantris</a>. Stepping into <em>Daggerheart </em>this wild-west themed campaign brings with it the deep story and the deeply funny that you'd come to expect from this group. As the campaign has been releasing I got to sit down with DM Mikey Gilder to understand how he built the world and get his thoughts on <em>Daggerheart</em>.</p>

<p>"Dust To Damnation is our three part (six episode) <em>Daggerheart </em>mini-campaign. It's a campaign in the Colossus of the Drylands campaign frame. It follows the folk of a town called Eden." Gilder introduced me to the plot. The Colossus of the Drylands campaign frame is one that the <em><a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="951117a2-07e4-403b-b1c3-26041d599e45" href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/daggerheart-review-narrative-forward-yes-and-ttrpg-that-is-force-to-be-reckoned" rel="nofollow">Daggerheart Core Rulebook</a></em> describes as a mix between Red Dead Redemption and Shadow of the Colossus or Attack On Titan.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>In <em>Daggerheart,&nbsp;</em>a Campaign Frame is a setting that an adventure might take place in. You can play <em>Daggerheart </em>in a traditional high-fantasy setting, but there are also pre-made Campaign Frames that lean into grimmdark concepts, the weird west, or a setting where your party will cook the monsters you kill.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>"It starts with the Sheriff returning after a long time away. [Shephard] is coming back to the town and a lot has changed and he finds out as soon as he is back that his deputy has been murdered and that kicks off the primary action."</p>

<p>There are a number of campaign frames included in the <em>Daggerheart </em>Core rules so I was interested to know if this had been picked for them as they were partnering with Darrington Press, or if there was something in particular about the setting that really spoke to him. Gilder revealed that he hadn't always been the planned DM for this adventure.</p>
<p><iframe allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed//LBZciFpxQNk"></iframe></p>

<p>"We knew the general scope, three sessions as a mini-campaign, but I wasn't originally going to GM it. Either Andy or Derek was going to GM it. Then we were reading through the Campaign frames, and I haven't GM'd in a very long time and so I decided to come out of my pseudo-retirement because the Campaing Frame was just so compelling."</p>

<p>This production was a combined effort of Darrington Press, publisher of <em>Daggerheart</em>, and Legends of Avantris. Talking on how the partnership came up Gilder explained that this has been a long time coming.</p>

<p>"We have been talking to the folks at Darrington and <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="d74413d3-67d3-4bdf-af02-6270f155a945" href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/features/critical-role-campaign-4-cast-interview-character-creation-incorrect-fan-collages" rel="nofollow">Critical Role</a> for a while now, and we always knew we were going to partner together," Gilder alluded to different meetings at conventions that had been going on. "Once <em>Daggerheart </em>was officially out there we decided a sponsored mini-campaign was the best place to start."</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"We told [Critical Role] we can tell tight storied in 3-5 sessions, it was pretty much a no brainer"</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Speaking to his love of the Wild West Gilder highlighted classic movies as well as series like Deadwood. "That [love of Western's] combined with the giant colossi, it was a pretty obvious choice for me to do it. I read through it once and I immediately knew what I wanted to do and that really goes to show the strength of the Campaign Frame."</p>

<p>Having reviewed and played <em>Daggerheart </em>when it released earlier this year I was clue'd in to the colossus that roam this setting but watching the mini-campaign an unaware viewer might not know what to expect. "I decided to not go really super hard into the whole colossus stuff, and then build up into it. So we could focus on a smaller human story and then build up towards the colossus and the massive stakes that are part of the campaign frame."</p>

<p>Gilder also commented that they weren't entirely sure how their group would get along with the system but they wanted to create an experience for viewers that might be shared with their table's first time playing <em>Daggerheart</em>. "It was very deliberate that we didn't spend a lot of time studying."</p>

We've gotten into some systems, and not cared for others." Gilder spoke about the group's history "<em>Daggerheart </em>really clicked with us extremely quickly, three of us had gotten a demo [...] then when we sat down and all of the extra addons, the cheat sheet and the cards made it easier to play the game."</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"We were very surprised at how useful the peripherals were and how easy it is to just dive in"</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Building The Town Of Eden</h2>

<p>Throughout the exploration of the starting town of the adventure, Eden, I immediately fell in love with the different characters. Each exactly as you'd expect from Western movies, but with a <em>Daggerheart </em>twist. I was interested to learn more about how Gilder populated the world.</p>

<p>"This is, in part, a huge loveletter to David Milch who is the creator of Deadwood and the actors and writers involved in that show and I think that's a huge reason why I got into storytelling and narrative." Gilder explained "The way that I approach story is very archetypical. The tropes that you expect in a genre I think are really important."</p>

<p>"It was me getting to pick the fun archetypes and tropes, and characters from Deadwood that I loved that I could plug in and do my version of a rough impression. When I don't have an impression it's still going to the archetype of a school teacher and really making sure that I approach the theme and turn it up to 11 so you IMMEDIATELY felt like you were in a weird west setting."</p>

<p>Diving deeper into some of the mechanics of <em>Daggerheart,&nbsp;</em>I spoke with Gilder about the different outcomes of checks in <em>Daggerheart</em>, not just being pass/fail but that you can have a success where you don't get everything you want, and a failure where something good can happen. I wanted to get Gilder's thoughts on this different approach to rolling outcomes.</p>

<p>"It is certainly more cognitive load, I will say, that general thrust of complications and varying degrees of success is an aspect that I bounced off of on other systems like PBTA but I think that <em>Daggerheart </em>does it in a way where the GM is still equipped to adjust and tweak."</p>

<p>Gilder spoke highly of the options given not only to the player but also the GM "It equipped me to be like 'oh wait, you succeeded with hope, I have GM fiat to then really make this awesome victory that you had'" Gilder jokes that a lot of other systems try to take those overly large victories away with additional rules.</p>

<p>On the flip side a success with fear does a lot to empower the GM too. "Even if they hit the bad guy, then I get a fear and the spotlight shifts to me and I can spend that Fear on something else. That was one of the bigger aspects of the system, especially if you've only played Dungeons &amp; Dragons."</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/avantris-daggerheart-dust-to-damnation01.jpg?itok=GipisK_u 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/avantris-daggerheart-dust-to-damnation01.jpg?itok=6cpPhRWb 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Gilder did highlight that his use for fear, joking that it might not be the 'right' way to GM <em>Daggerheart </em>was to "not use Fear in non-combat scenarios. When it comes to roleplay that's where it's very natural for us. For me building up the fear and having really brutal and terrifying combat, spending as much as I can at the beginning to make it scary. Then if I don't generate anymore and the players come and wipe out the adversary that's narratively valid."</p>

<h2>The Key To A Strong One-Shot Start</h2>

<p>Watching along with the stream I was enthralled from the getgo, I was interested to hear from Gilder what his guiding principal was when creating a mini-campaign or one-shot that hits the ground running.</p>

<p>"My secret to success is effectively the buy in from the players, basically this is the scene and you're introduced, and you're introduced, and you're introduced," Gilder explained counting off his castmates. "Nikki and Derek, who play Quibly and Portia Bella, they sat there for like an hour and a half while we introduced them."</p>

<p>"If they're meeting for the first time you need to have a plan of how you're going to drive the story forward. In a one-shot, when you have less time, it needs to be GM driven and you need to keep your foot on the gas. You're drawn into the call to action so there's no debate as to what to do and there's no back and forth which can eat up a lot of time at the table."</p>

<p>Every good campaign needs a good villain so I was also eager to have Gilder explain his philosophy behind creating one. "That is my favorite part of GMing, it's the villains. I think when it comes to creating a good villain I've never been a fan of the dark lord in the tower."</p>

<p>"I think that having that human connection is really important. You don't need a ton, but I think it's really important when you only have one scene before the final confrontation and I think as long as you make sure you tie into the antagonist into what they represent and you present that very clearly and present the direct conflict it feels very personal."</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"Even if you have one scene that builds up 'bad guy must pay' that does so much for building that investment for players."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Being a fan of TTRPGs I know what I like behind my GM screen and I know there's hundreds of different ways to approach what tools you use. I was interested to hear what it was that Gilder keeps behind his GM screen to run Dust To Damnation.</p>

<p>"I have a very ramshackle vibe behind the screen, I really just have the PDF open, and what I do is I have a google drive with screenshots of relevant sections that I might need." Gilder waved a finger in the air pointing to imaginary reference material "Then I have printed out a GM cheat sheet. Then just having your stat blocks where you can get them and scrap paper and a pen."</p>

<p>"Our production, despite how much we've grown, it isn't super polished," Gilder joked, "We don't have all of these miniatures or terrain; we have a Chessex Battle Map and bottle caps with tokens that are highly readable."</p>

<p>Explaining further Gilder likes the idea of putting the basics out on the table, for the players and fans at home to be able to fill in the finer details of any encounter.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/lego-drops-major-black-friday-deal-on-r2-d2-set-now-going-for-mere-pennies-on-amazon-2000645124</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>LEGO rarely slashes the prices on its Star Wars sets aggressively since they sell at full retail throughout most of the year. This R2-D2 building set just became <strong>the first major Star Wars release</strong> to see a substantial Black Friday discount, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4474/">now sitting at $79 instead of the usual $99 price tag</a>. That’s a new all-time low on a set that already flies off the shelves with its nearly <strong>perfect 4.9 out of 5 stars rating</strong> across thousands of reviews.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4474/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>1,050 Pieces That Build an Iconic Droid</h2>
<p>This completed model of R2-D2 <strong>is over 9 inches tall, with a 6-inch width and a 4-inch depth</strong>, and offers significant desk or shelf presence without dominating entire surfaces. The cylindrical body features curved bricks and plates to achieve R2-D2’s characteristic dome shape and blue-white color scheme. The detail work features printed tiles for control panels, sensor arrays, and characteristic red and blue panels that help define R2-D2’s look throughout the Star Wars films.</p>
<p>Functional features add play value <strong>beyond static display</strong>: The dome head rotates 360 degrees with smooth action, letting you position R2-D2 looking in any direction. A detachable third leg extends from the body, recreating the droid’s mobility configuration seen throughout the original trilogy. An attachable periscope replicates the scanning device R2-D2 deploys in various scenes and additional tool attachments represent the droid’s utility arms and mechanical appendages.</p>



<p>Accompanying the set is a bonus 25th Anniversary Darth Malak mini-figure to commemorate LEGO Star Wars’ quarter-century of releases. Darth Malak originates from the Knights of the Old Republic video game era and represents deep-cut Star Wars lore instead of the usual movie characters that casual fans may be more familiar with. The minifigure sports unique printing, with Malak’s distinctive metal jaw prosthesis and Sith robes.</p>
<p>The building complexity is firmly in the intermediate range and thus appropriate for the 10-plus age recommendation. The instruction manual breaks construction into clearly numbered steps across multiple bags, letting you build the model over several sessions without losing track of progress. Younger builders might need adult assistance with some of the curved sections where brick placement becomes less intuitive. The <strong>1,050-piece count delivers several hours of building time</strong>, and lands between a quick evening project and a multi-day marathon build.</p>



<p>Color accuracy matches R2-D2’s on-screen appearance using bright blue, white, and light gray elements. Recent improvements to LEGO’s color palette mean that the blues match between different batches and piece types, avoiding some of the color variation issues that affected some of their older sets. Specialized curved and angled pieces create smooth surfaces rather than a stepped, pixelated look, common in early LEGO character attempts.</p>
<p>At $79, you’re paying roughly $0.075 per piece which falls below typical LEGO Star Wars pricing that usually hovers around $0.10 per piece. Licensed sets command premium pricing compared to generic LEGO themes which makes any discount on Star Wars releases noteworthy.</p>

              <p>Most of us wait for year-end sales to grab big-ticket items, and it’s finally that time of the year. Black Friday is still a week away, but you don’t have to wait till then to start saving. Early deals are coming in hot already!</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5664/">Those who have been looking to upgrade their gaming setup for less can now grab the 27-inch LG UltraGear OLED gaming monitor for just $500 on Amazon, after a massive 44% drop in its retail price of $900</a>. It’s definitely not your average markdown, as most other options with somewhat similar spec sheets sit well over $1,000. But as you’d expect, it’s a limited-time discount. The retailer hasn’t mentioned when the deal ends, but based on past trends, it’s safe to say it won’t be around for long. Hurry to grab yours before the price goes back up, or the stock expires for good.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5664/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Brilliant Color Accuracy for Lifelike Visuals</h2>
<p>The size is fairly decent. It’s not too big to take over your entire desk space, nor too small to make everything feel cramped; just the right size. The 27-inch screen supports VESA DisplayHDR True Black 400, which offers brilliant color accuracy, especially in scenes with low light. The 1.5 million:1 contrast ratio paired with 98.5% DCI-P3 color coverage makes sure all your favorite content appears lifelike, just how the creator intended. You’ll get brighter highlights in daylight scenes and excellent clarity in the dark, which is great for spotting the bad guys hidden in the shadows.</p>



<p>The screen also has an anti-glare, low-reflection coating that makes it easier on the eyes. You won’t have to fight reflections in brighter settings or squint to see what’s on screen during the day.</p>
<p>Performance-wise, you’re getting a 240Hz refresh rate and an ultra-responsive 0.03ms GtG response time for ultra-fast, smooth gameplay. It’s officially G-SYNC Compatible and supports AMD FreeSync Premium Pro, meaning you’ll enjoy exceptional performance regardless of the GPU at hand.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5664/">You also have the option to make height, tilt, and pivot adjustments as you like. Sitting back or playing while standing – the monitor stays at just the right angle.</a> For connectivity, there are both HDMI 2.1 and DisplayPort 1.4 options, plus you even get a 2-year warranty on the OLED panel with your purchase for some extra peace of mind. Get your orders in before it shoots back up!</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/take-two-strauss-zelnick-gta-6-pc-console-exclusive-2000645103</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/take-two-ceo-says-consoles-won%E2%80%99t-die-but-pc-is-the-future.1356838/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The divide between PC and console gaming isn’t what it once was. Heck, in a world where <i>Gears of War</i> and <a href="https://kotaku.com/halo-1-remake-combat-evolved-trailer-hwc-teaser-xbox-ps5-2000638911"><i>Halo</i> are on PlayStation</a>, the divide between console platforms isn’t even what it once was. And according to the CEO of <i>GTA 6</i>’s publisher, Take-Two, PC gaming is only going to grow.</p> <p>Speaking to CNBC (<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/take-two-boss-says-gaming-is-moving-towards-pc-but-gta-6-is-still-down-for-ps5-and-xbox-series-x-and-s-at-launch">h/t <i>IGN</i></a>), Take-Two’s CEO Strauss Zelnick said he sees the industry “moving towards PC,” as things become “open rather than closed.” He’s not completely writing off consoles, however, saying that the experience of sitting in front of a big screen for hours on end with a game is “never going away.”</p>

 <p>Given the current landscape, Zelnick’s comments ring true. Console exclusives are somewhat of an endangered species these days, with Microsoft publishing Xbox titles on its competitor’s platforms, the Switch 2 proving powerful enough to run titles like <i>Cyberpunk 2077</i> on the go, Sony publishing once PlayStation-only experiences on Steam, and, naturally, devices like the Steam Deck and the upcoming Steam Machine breaking down the boundaries that once restricted where and how we could play PC games.</p>

 <h2>How will the Steam Machine shake things up for console gaming?</h2> <p>Last week, <a href="https://kotaku.com/16-cool-details-valve-new-steam-machine-console-controller-vr-headset-2000643572">Valve showed off its impressive new hardware lineup</a>, including a new VR headset, a brand new Steam controller, and a cube-shaped mini-PC it calls the Steam Machine. Valve previously worked with PC hardware manufacturers to ship <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steam_Machine_(computer)">Steam Machines 10 years ago</a>, though they failed to catch on. But now that the company has dramatically improved the experience of SteamOS and the magic of running Windows games on a Linux operating system, if priced competitively, the new Steam Machine could become a pathway to having the kinds of “big screen” experiences Zelnick talks about with PC games.</p>

 <p>Speaking for myself, if the <a href="https://kotaku.com/steam-machine-controller-steamos-reaction-price-date-2000643563">Steam Machine proves as awesome as it sounds</a>, I could see myself holing up in a cabin somewhere (with an internet connection!) to finish my entire Steam backlog without an Xbox or PlayStation in sight.</p> <p>I jest, but only slightly. As PCs continue to explore new form factors and Steam and other storefronts remain a reliable way to build and maintain a digital library, I don’t think it’s unreasonable to expect a slow and steady exodus from locked-in console experiences.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/gamestop-trade-in-anything-day-rules-2000645098</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/gamestop-employees-are-freaking-out-about-%E2%80%98trade-anything-day%E2%80%99-%E2%80%98god-help-us%E2%80%99.1356832/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Earlier this week, meme stock retailer turned Pok</span><span>é</span><span>mon card pawn shop, GameStop, announced a new trade-in stunt engineered to go viral. “<a href="https://kotaku.com/gamestop-trade-anything-taxidermy-store-credit-2000644850">Trade Anything Day</a>” will let customers come in and hand over almost anything in exchange for store credit. Employees who weren’t told about the promotional stunt in advance are already preparing for the worst. Some are even trying to harness the chaos for a good cause.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>GameStop’s official announcement says people can bring in their junk and trade it in on December 6 for credit toward games and other purchases as long as it doesn’t violate a long list of exceptions. Those include hazardous materials, things that pose health risks, and Meta Quest VR headsets, for some reason. Trade-ins for stuff the stores normally accept will continue as usual.</span></p>

 <p><span>But that’s not the whole story. A flyer </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GameStop/comments/1ozzats/trade_anything_promotion_information/"><span>store employees received</span></a><span> goes into more detail and explains exactly how “Trade Anything Day”is supposed to work. Customers can only trade in one nonsense item that day. They only get $5 store credit, no matter what it is. At the very end, employees will be tasked with taking all of the qualifying items to local, approved donation drop-off points. Presumably everything else will be thrown out.&nbsp;</span></p>

   <p><span>“We’re getting so many calls already and people are being extra people-y already because they aren’t reading the rules,” one current employee told </span><i><span>Kotaku</span></i><span>. “The problem has been lately that they drop this stuff on socials and we find out hours or days later.”</span></p>

 <p><span>Other GameStop workers are already crashing out. “God help us,” reads </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GameStop/comments/1ozy57j/god_help_us/"><span>one thread</span></a><span> on the r/gamestop subreddit. “I’m not prepared for the ‘bring anything to trade’ day. I just know I’m going to have to handle some nasty shit. And not only that, we’re probably going to have to reject some of the things because they’re a biological hazard. I’m gonna have so many customers asking me ‘HoW cOmE yOu CaN’t TaKe iT iN?’ Cause we can’t bro.”</span></p>

 <p><span>The fact that all of the trade-ins have to be donated or thrown out has already inspired some stores to try and coax their customers into trading in canned goods and other non-perishables or toys that can be used for holiday gift drive charities. For some reason, GameStop isn’t advertising that part of the promotion. Instead it’s making jokes about trading in taxidermy animals.</span></p>

 <p><span>“A store next door to mine has a Toys for Tots bin, so we’re going to push for toys,” an employee told </span><i><span>Kotaku</span></i><span>. “A co-worker’s church is doing a coat and sweater drive so we’ll push for that. And we’ve talked to a couple of our regular Pok</span><span>é</span><span>mon collectors about bringing in a five-ish dollar card to join the collection of cards we give to kids who come in at my store and can’t get packs [because of scalpers].”</span></p> <p><span>They’re hoping this can add a silver lining to what otherwise promises to be a messy day. While GameStop is infamous for its poor trade-in values, store employees are also used to dealing with unreasonable customers expecting top dollar for last year’s </span><i><span>Madden</span></i><span>. I can only guess how it will go when they try to bring in a cardboard box of moldy junk and only get $5 off of </span><i><span>Kriby Air Riders</span></i><span> for it.&nbsp;</span></p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/asus-rog-strix-g16-ryzen-9-rtx-5070-1tb-drops-to-peanuts-amazon-offloads-2025-model-stock.1356829/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Gaming laptops require serious hardware in order to run modern titles at high settings without thermal throttling or performance compromises during extended sessions. The <strong>Asus ROG Strix G16</strong> (2025 edition) packs flagship-tier components into a portable package, and it is <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5674/">now $1,699 down from the usual $2,199 price tag.</a></p>
<p>That’s a <strong>record low for Black Friday on Amazon</strong> and it feels aggressive; after all, this is a 2025 model that just launched earlier this year. You’re getting an AMD Ryzen 9 9955HX processor paired with an Nvidia GeForce RTX 5070 laptop GPU, 32GB of DDR5-5600 RAM, and a 1TB PCIe Gen 4 SSD.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5674/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Ryzen 9 9955HX and RTX 5070 Blackwell Architecture</h2>
<p>The <strong>Ryzen 9 9955HX is AMD’s newest high-performance mobile processor,</strong> boasting <strong>16 cores and 32 threads on the Zen 5 architecture</strong>. The base clock sits at 2.5GHz, while boost speeds go as high as 5.4GHz on single-threaded workloads for serious processing power in gaming, streaming, and content creation. It can also handle background tasks like Discord, multiple browser tabs, and streaming software without negatively impacting the actual performance of your game.</p>
<p>In the RTX 5070, t<strong>he new Blackwell architecture from Nvidia</strong>, the DLSS 4 support, and the Max-Q power optimization all come into play. DLSS 4 generates additional frames using AI processing, effectively doubling or tripling frame rates in supported games without quality loss. Ray tracing performance sees considerable improvements over previous 40-series cards, enabling ray-traced reflections and lighting without framerates penalties that made earlier generations impractical to use. The 8 GB of GDDR6 VRAM can handle 1440p gaming comfortably with high to ultra settings in current AAA titles.</p>



<p>The<strong> DDR5-5600 RAM is available in a 32GB capacity</strong> across dual channels, providing plenty of bandwidth for memory-intensive games and applications. This speed grade is a major leap from DDR4, which reduces latency in CPU-bound scenarios and improves minimum frame rates when things get really intense during gameplay. The 1TB PCIe Gen 4 SSD hits sequential read speeds of about 7,000 MB/s, which cuts game load times to just seconds instead of minutes.</p>



<p>The<strong> 16-inch ROG Nebula display runs at 2560 x 1600 resolution</strong> and has a 16:10 aspect ratio for more vertical screen real estate than is provided by standard 16:9 panels. The extra vertical pixels help with productivity work like coding or document editing, while gaming benefits remain minimal. The 240Hz refresh rate with 3ms response time creates incredibly responsive gameplay in competitive shooters and fast-paced action games.</p>
<p>The Tri-Fan cooling system consists of three separate fans, each connected to a full-width <strong>heatsink and leading air out through comprehensive venting coverage around the perimeter of the chassis</strong>. The aggressive setup here keeps temperatures comfortable even in hours-long gaming marathons with demanding titles. Fan noise stays reasonable at moderate levels of performance, only spiking audibly loud when pushing maximum GPU and CPU loads simultaneously. Liquid metal thermal compound on the CPU improves the efficiency of heat transfer compared to traditional thermal paste, and it drops temperatures by several degrees under load.</p>



<p>WiFi 6E support accesses the newer 6GHz band for reduced interference and lower latency compared to standard WiFi 6. Bluetooth 5.3 handles wireless peripherals with improved range and connection stability. The port selection houses <strong>dual USB-C with DisplayPort functionality, three USB-A 3.2 ports, HDMI 2.1 for 4K external displays, an SD card reader, and a 3.5mm audio jack</strong>.</p>
<p>Windows 11 Home pre-installs ROG’s Armoury Crate software for performance tuning, fan curves, RGB control, and system monitoring. Battery capacity hits 90Wh, providing roughly 4 to 6 hours during light productivity work and 1 to 2 hours when gaming unplugged. The included 280W power adapter handles the maximum system draw during peak performance scenarios.</p>
<p>You’re getting here current-generation flagship components for 23% below retail pricing on a laptop that only launched months ago. By comparison, competing gaming laptops from MSI and Alienware with similar RTX 5070 specs usually fall between $2,200 and $2,600.</p>

              <p>With sports titles be they Madden, FIFA, or NBA 2K, because we get a new entry each year, the value of a previous year’s entry drop dramatically once the new one comes out. So you can typically save quite a bit of cash by keeping up with the franchise on a one year delay as the price comes down. Though that comes with the caveat of never having up to date rosters and staying a year behind on any new changes to the series. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5666/">That changes right now though because the latest entry for basketball in&nbsp;<em>NBA 2K26</em> has dropped to just $30 at Amazon</a>. This is a 57% discount from its launch price of $70, saving you a whole $40 before our calendar’s have even reached the year that’s in the dang title.</p>
<p>As you can expect, the latest in this annual sports titles looks the best the series ever has — looking even better than the year’s before this one, which looked even better than the year’s before that one.</p>

<p>Any improvements to the gameplay are incremental as this series is built on a long legacy with just a single year turnaround before needing to put out the next one. If you pick up the latest NBA 2K each year, you’ll notice these changes. Among them is a updated shot meter. <em>NBA 2K25</em>‘s shot meter was met with criticism, the new one isn’t exactly a return to form but represents a much more intuitive and easier-to-time mechanic than the previous entry.</p>
