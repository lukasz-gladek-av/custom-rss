<p>It has been confirmed by ESL FACEIT that IEM Dallas will run alongside DreamHack Dallas in Texas in May 2025.</p>



<p>From May 23 – 25, the world’s most prolific Counter-Strike teams will descend on Texas to take part in IEM Dallas, one of the most prestigious events in the CS2 esports calendar.</p>



<p>Read on to get the full story.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-iem-going-to-texas">IEM Going to Texas</h2>



<p>This year’s IEM Dallas event was a monumental spectacle, with the event going down to the wire between G2 Esports and Team Vitality. It ended up being a win for G2, putting an end to a cold period that had lasted since the team won at IEM Cologne in August 2023. </p>



<p>It effectively kickstarted a spree for G2, with the team going on to win big at the BLAST Fall Final and then the BLAST World Final later in the year. The squad also wound up in second place in Counter-Strike’s tournament at the Esports World Cup.</p>



<p>In a press release, it was written:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>ESL FACEIT Group, the leading esports and video game entertainment company, today announced DreamHack Dallas and Intel® Extreme Masters (IEM) Dallas 2025 will jointly return to Texas’ Key Bailey Hutchison Convention Center on May 23-25. </p>



<p>The pair of events will rally tens of thousands of gaming and esports fans to witness top-tier competition, hundreds of their favorite creators, dozens of indie titles, and more.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Tickets will go on sale from December 5 – are you interested in heading to IEM Dallas? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <p>
PlayStation co-CEO Hermen Hulst has weighed in on on the role of artificial intelligence in game development, saying that while the technology has the capacity to "revolutionise" the games industry, it won't replace the "human touch".
</p>
<p>
Speaking <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c4gpz291z59o">with the BBC</a> to mark <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-30th-anniversary">PlayStation's 30th anniversary</a>, Hulst acknowledged that while AI technology is changing game development, human developers will always have a role to play. "I suspect there will be a dual demand in gaming," he suggested. "One for AI-driven innovative experiences and another for handcrafted, thoughtful content... Striking the right balance between leveraging AI and preserving the human touch will be crucial."
</p>
<p>
This isn't the first time PlayStation execs have addressed the issue of AI. PlayStation Studios' head of product Asad Qizilbash previously <a href="https://www.sony.com/en/SonyInfo/creative-entertainment-vision/interview/3.html">insisted</a> the technology "will create more personalised experiences and meaningful stories for consumers", adding, "This is important for the younger Gen Z and Gen Alpha audiences, who are the first generations that grew up digitally and are looking for personalisation across everything, as well as looking for experiences to have more meaning."

<p>
AI chatter has, of course, become increasingly pronounced in recent years as advancements make headlines and executives - from <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-offering-generative-ai-tools-to-its-studios">Microsoft</a> to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/embracer-says-it-will-have-a-human-centric-approach-to-leveraging-the-potential-of-ai">Embracer Group</a> - talk up the technology to excite investors. Earlier this year, for instance, EA CEO Andrew Wilson <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ai-is-the-very-core-of-our-business-says-ea-ceo">told investors</a> AI was at "the very core of our business", adding the company had over a hundred "active novel AI projects" to assist with game development. 
</p><p>
Nintendo president Shuntaro Furukawa, too, recently acknowledged "game development and AI technology have always had a close relationship" and that generative AI could be "used in creative ways". However, he <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-eschewing-generative-ai-in-favour-of-decades-of-know-how">insisted</a> the company's "decades of know-how" was more valuable than AI when it came to "creating the best gaming experiences for our players".
</p>
<p>
Earlier this, a report by game engine maker Unity claimed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ai-already-used-by-62-of-studios-unity-report-claims">62 percent of studios have used AI at some point during game development</a>, with 71 percent saying AI had improved their delivery and operations, reducing time to launch. But aspects of the technology remain highly controversial, from the sources it utilises to the things it creates. In March, for instance, several <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-actors-reveal-the-darker-side-of-success-fuelled-by-ai-voice-cloning">Baldur's Gate 3 actors discussed the darker side of success fuelled by AI voice cloning</a>.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/safe-and-sound-infinity-action-box-review.1050945/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/safe-and-sound-infinity-action-box-review<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Transportation accessories for wargaming are essential for taking your miniatures safely to a gaming club, tournament, or even a friend's house, and carry cases tend to fall into 1 of 2 types, foam or magnetized. Foam storage either has the miniatures sitting between two layers or has shapes in the foam that the miniatures sit in. Magnetic has metal in a part of it, and after attaching magnets to your miniatures, they'll sit securely on the metal plate in the carry case.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.safeandsound.pl/" rel="nofollow">Safe and Sound</a> decided that if you're going to the trouble of selecting and carrying a case, it might as well be useful once you get to your gaming area. The&nbsp;<em>Infinity</em> Action Box, once it's done the job of transporting your miniatures securely, also doubles as a piece of scenery during the game. In this article, we'll look at the <em>Infinity</em> Action Box, and see how many <em><a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/infinity-operation-sandtrap-review-launch-of-infinity-n5" rel="nofollow">Infinity</a></em> miniatures we can get in it, and we'll also look at some of the larger magnetic boxes Safe and Sound offers.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/safe-and-sound-4.jpg?itok=SpjJ1H6f 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/safe-and-sound-4.jpg?itok=VV3waM5b 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The&nbsp;Safe and Sound <em>Infinity</em> Action Box comes with removable internal walls, and an extra container scenery piece.</figcaption></figure>

<p>The Safe and Sound<i> Infinity </i>Action Box is a magnetic miniatures transportation box, that also doubles as a scenery piece for your games. It's officially sanctioned by Corvus Belli, the makers of <em>Infinity</em>, so you'll see lots of Infinity markings all over it. The box also comes with a removable internal element that acts as walls if you want to use the case an internal building, and also a card shipping container.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/safe-and-sound-7.jpg?itok=ZFhw0xTF 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/safe-and-sound-7.jpg?itok=cP020v99 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The Safe and Sound <em>Infinity</em> Action Box comes in 3 types with different options (Photo Credit - Safe and Sound).</figcaption></figure><p>The <em>Infinity</em> Action Box comes in three different types.&nbsp;</p>

<ul><li>The standard <em>Infinity</em> Action Box&nbsp;with a magnetized base (this is the type we're reviewing in this article)</li>
	<li>The <em>Infinity</em> Action Box with a magnetized base and back plate</li>
	<li>The <em>Infinity</em> Action Box with a magnetized base and lid</li>
</ul><figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/safe-and-sound-2.jpg?itok=E6KXGhoo 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/safe-and-sound-2.jpg?itok=42jzpQSm 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>We nearly got all of our <em>Infinity</em> JSA miniatures in the Safe and Sound <em>Infinity</em> Action Box.</figcaption></figure><h2>How Many Miniatures Can The Safe And Sound Infinity Action Box Carry?</h2>

<p>As you can see in the image above, we got nearly our entire <em>Infinity</em> JSA collection into a single <em>Infinity</em> Action Box. That was 65 miniatures, including 5 on large bases. The only ones we couldn't get in were 2 bikes, 2 remotes, and the old&nbsp;O-Yoroi Kidobutai T.A.G. (which doesn't fit in the box standing up and needs to be laid down). If we had the box with the magnetized back plate or lid, we could have easily put these in as there was loads of space above the standard units in the larger area.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/safe-and-sound-3.jpg?itok=gh0sZP3S 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/safe-and-sound-3.jpg?itok=WfdQfzCn 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Once your miniatures are magnatised, the Safe and Sound <em>Infinity</em> Action Box keeps them secure during movement.</figcaption></figure><p>The <em>Infinity</em> Action Box also held the miniatures securely when sideways or upside down, the magnets holding well to the metal plate. To magnetize your miniatures, pick up some&nbsp;5x2mm magnets, which are pretty small and very cheap for packs of 100 or more. The standard <em>Infinity</em> bases (because Corvus Belli are awesome), actually have a round slot for the magnet to fit in, so once a small bit of super glue is on the base, it keeps the magnet from sliding around while it dries, giving you a solid connection. Some of the older larger, metal <em>Infinity</em> miniatures like the bikes and the O-Yoroi need 2 of the smaller magnets, but as the new larger <em>Infinity</em> miniatures are made from a lightweight resin, one 5x2mm is perfect to hold them in place.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/safe-and-sound-5.jpg?itok=FgnuUbg0 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/safe-and-sound-5.jpg?itok=_ZLfHibZ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The Safe and Sound <em>Infinity</em> Action Box looks great during games, even if you're not using the internal elements, it's even got my factions NA2 logo on the front.</figcaption></figure><h2>How Durable Is The Safe And Sound Infinity Action Box?</h2>

<p>When you think about a card box, it probably doesn't sound very durable over a plastic box, but the <em>Infinity</em> Action Box can take a knock and still keep your miniatures safe. More so because they're stuck to the base, so they're not moving around inside when it is moved or bashed. When closed, two card folds slide into slits, and a velcro fastener keeps it shut while traveling. The thickness of the sides also helps with durability, keeping the lid straight across the top, even with heavy miniatures placed on it (like you might when using it during games).</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/safe-and-sound-6.jpg?itok=4Y9ulusY 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/safe-and-sound-6.jpg?itok=qxbVcKYw 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Here you can see the Strike Force box is twice the size of&nbsp;The Safe and Sound <em>Infinity</em> Action Box, with some extra height for larger miniatures.</figcaption></figure><h2>Do Safe And Sound Make Other Box Sizes?</h2>

<p><a href="https://www.safeandsound.pl/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Safe and Sound</a> makes a whole range of boxes, storage, and transport products for your wargaming needs. They even make foam inserts for the boxes and bags that you can stack multiple boxes in. You can see in the image above the size comparison of the <em>Infinity</em> Action Box, and the Sci-Fi Strike Force Box, which is two Action Boxes long, and a bit higher for the taller miniatures. Safe and Sound offers a range of sizes and styles of magnetized and standard boxes to suit your army transportation requirements. I generally play skirmish games, with smaller army sizes, like <em>Infinity</em>, <em>Bushido</em>, and <em>Kill Team</em>, and the Army Box is perfect for carrying my entire collection for that game's faction, to give me some list-building variety while I'm there.</p>

<h2>What Are Our Final Thoughts On The Safe And Sound Infinity Action Box?</h2>

<p>The <em>Infinity</em> Action Box is a solid transportation option, that fits a lot of miniatures for its small size. The fact that it doubles as a scenery piece is a bonus and that you get another scenery piece and the internal walls is awesome. I would definitely invest in the Action Box with the metal lid, just for the extra capacity and to maximize the use of the space, and also because having your JSA ninjas hanging off the roof is very on-theme.</p>

<h2>Should I Buy The Safe And Sound Infinity Action Box?</h2>

<p>If you want a magnatised transport option, that also looks great during games of <em>Infinity</em>, then the <em>Infinity</em> Action Box is a great purchase. The box doesn't suit fantasy settings, but Safe and Sound do offer other box styles. It also fits a lot of miniatures for a skirmish game. If you only play with 10-15 miniatures, it might be too big, and if you roll out with 70+ miniatures and large vehicles, then the other size boxes might be a better option.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/3/24312047/animal-crossing-pocket-camp-complete-review-microtransactions<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Though it <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/22/16691618/animal-crossing-pocket-camp-review-iphone-android-nintendo">started out pretty chill</a>, over the years, <em>Animal Crossing: Pocket Camp</em> steadily became bloated with monetization. There were all kinds of things to spend real money on, including loot boxes for unlocking rare items. When I logged in to the game last week after months away, my screen was dominated by notifications vying for my attention, most of them involving spending some kind of cash.</p><p>That’s what makes <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/2/24310972/animal-crossing-pocket-camp-complete-paid-launch-iphone-android">the new paid version of the app</a> so intriguing. The original <em>Pocket Camp</em> has technically shut down, replaced by <em>Pocket Camp Complete</em>, which gets rid of all the in-app purchases in exchange for a one-time fee. (It’s $9.99 at launch on both <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/animal-crossing-pocket-camp-c/id6547834967">iOS</a> and <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fplay.google.com%2Fstore%2Fapps%2Fdetails%3Fid%3Dcom.nintendo.zasa">Android</a>, which will jump to $19.99 in January.) And without the looming specter of having to spend real money, this version of <em>Pocket Camp</em> is a whole lot more relaxing.</p><p>Fundamentally, the game is the same. You’re tasked with running a campground for a bunch of friendly animals, which involves designing various spots for them to hang out, while also doing traditional <em>Animal Crossing</em> activities like fishing and catching bugs. The game allows existing <em>Pocket Camp</em> players to transfer their saves — all you need to do is link a Nintendo account — and I found the process pretty seamless. I simply logged in to the new app, and my old campground, along with the seven years’ worth of stuff I’d accumulated, was there waiting for me.</p><p>In the original version, you could spend money on a currency called Leaf Tickets that let you do a lot of things, like speeding up crafting and plant growth or unlocking additional treasures from the seafaring Gulliver. The most notorious thing you could buy with Leaf Tickets were fortune cookies, which are essentially loot boxes: eat one, and you got a random item tied to a themed set. But you never knew what you’d get, so if you were after a particular item to finish off your campground cafe, it was easy to spend a lot on cookies.</p><p>In <em>Complete</em>, Leaf Tickets have been replaced by Leaf Tokens. Fundamentally, the tokens are the same. But crucially, you can’t buy them with real cash; you either earn them in-game by completing quests or buy them with bells, <em>Animal Crossing</em>’s in-game currency. Psychologically, this makes a huge difference. It never feels like the game is trying to cheat me out of actual money, since I can’t actually spend any. Instead, they’re a nice bonus that I can save up to buy cool things or speed up an annoyingly long renovation.</p><p>You can still feel the previous monetization inherent in <em>Complete</em>’s design; the loot box cookies remain, as do some of the more annoying features, like treasure maps that require very specific items to explore. I would love to see a version of <em>Pocket Camp</em> that was designed from the ground up to be a one-time paid experience. But even if the free-to-play seams show, <em>Complete</em> is still a much more enjoyable experience simply by removing the ability to spend real cash.</p><p>On top of that, <em>Complete</em> adds a handful of genuinely good features. There’s a new location where you can hang out with your human friends and listen to a K.K. Slider concert, and you can now assign a caretaker animal for your campground, who will do some of the busywork when you’re away from the game. There are also friend cards that make it a little easier to find and play with other people.</p><p>Perhaps most interesting, there’s a new connection with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/19/22339896/animal-crossing-new-horizons-review-one-year-nintendo-switch"><em>New Horizons</em></a>; <em>Pocket Camp</em> players can import certain custom designs from the Switch game, which really expands options for clothing in particular. During the height of <em>New Horizons</em>’ popularity, players (and also brands) made all kinds of impressive things, and I’ve spent too much time digging through old creator codes to find stuff to wear. It’s not perfect — not all designs are compatible, and some show up fairly pixelated in the mobile game — but at least I can finally wear a Montreal Expos cap when I grab a coffee from Brewster.</p><p>Nintendo’s mobile ambitions didn’t quite take off the way many of us expected <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/9/7/12836392/nintendo-mario-iphone-apple">when Shigeru Miyamoto stood onstage at an Apple event to introduce <em>Super Mario Run</em></a>. That game <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/10/31/16580976/super-mario-run-nintendo-downloads-profit">didn’t make profit the way Nintendo had hoped</a>, and the company’s subsequent mobile games, like <em>Fire Emblem Heroes</em> and <em>Mario Kart Tour</em>, are all heavily monetized. That was the case for <em>Pocket Camp,</em> too — but its new iteration provides a brief glimpse at an alternate timeline where Nintendo’s smartphone games aren’t always trying to sell you something.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Bethesda Game Studios has just released ‘The Gleaming Depths’ update on Fallout 76. This super-sized patch stands as the largest endgame update the game has ever received, and it introduces a string of new features – including the game’s first ‘raid’ – to give late-game players more of a point in playing.</p>



<p>Read on to learn about everything coming in Fallout 76’s last major update in 2024.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-enter-the-gleaming-depths">Enter The Gleaming Depths</h2>



<p>The most important thing being delivered in this update is The Gleaming Depths, an all-new raid that’s designed to push players to new heights in terms of a solid, in-game challenge. It’s built to be tackled by a team of four players, all overseeing a unique role, such as Healer, Tank, or DPS.</p>



<p>Bethesda has finally introduced 4-Star Legendary Items into Fallout 76 with The Gleaming Depths update. Players will need to complete challenges in the new raid to unlock the top-most Legendary mods that boast powerful attributes.</p>



<p>Pets are also being brought into the game in The Gleaming Depths update. These C.A.M.P. items are open to everyone, but they’re locked to these ‘bases’ in-game. They won’t follow you around, but they can be customised slightly and interacted with, if that’s your kind of thing.</p>



<p>Following this update, you’ll also be able to assign yourself a title, using a series of prefixes and suffixes earned through quests and events to denote what kind of player you are in the Appalachian wasteland.</p>



<p>And of course, The Gleaming Depths update marks the arrival of Season 19 – The Scientific Forge. This update offers a boon for Enclave fans, as the entire scoreboard full of rewards is focused on the mysterious, malicious faction.</p>



<p>Finally, the team has worked to bring about hundreds of bug fixes, perk adjustments, and optimisations to the game. It’s one hell of an update.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/12/the-raspberry-pi-5-now-works-as-a-smaller-faster-kind-of-steam-link/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                      
                      
          <p>The Steam Link was <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2015/10/steams-living-room-hardware-blitz-gets-off-to-a-muddy-start/#page-3">a little box ahead of its time</a>. It streamed games from a PC to a TV, ran 1,500 0f them natively, offered a strange (if somewhat lovable) little controller, and essentially required a great network, Ethernet cables, and a good deal of fiddling.</p>
<p>Valve <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2018/11/valve-quietly-discontinues-steam-link-hardware-production/">quietly discontinued the Steam Link gear in November 2018</a>, but it didn't give up. These days, a Steam Link app can be found on most platforms, and Valve's sustained effort to move Linux-based (i.e., non-Windows-controlled) gaming forward has <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/08/valves-bespoke-steam-deck-os-will-be-officially-available-on-asus-rog-ally/">paid real dividends</a>. If you still want a dedicated device to stream Steam games, however? A Raspberry Pi 5 (with some help from Valve) can be a Substitute Steam Link.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.com/news/valves-steam-link-on-raspberry-pi/">detailed in the Raspberry Pi blog</a>, there were previously means of getting Steam Link working on Raspberry Pi devices, but the platform's move away from proprietary Broadcom libraries—and from X to Wayland display systems—required "a different approach." <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/id/slouken">Sam Lantinga from Valve</a> worked with the Raspberry Pi team on optimizing for the Raspberry Pi 5 hardware. As of <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/353380/discussions/6/4629231777834100224/">Steam Link 1.3.13</a> for the little board, Raspberry Pi 5 units could support up to 1080p at 144 frames per second (FPS) on the H.264 protocol and 4k at 60 FPS or 1080p at 240 FPS, presuming your primary gaming computer and network can support that.</p>

<p>I have a documented preference for <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/04/nvidias-gamestream-is-dead-sunshine-and-moonlight-are-better-replacements/">a Moonlight/Sunshine game streaming setup</a> over Steam Link because I have better luck getting games streaming at their best on it. But it's hard to beat Steam Link for ease of setup, given that it only requires Steam to be running on the host PC, plus a relatively simple configuration on the client screen. A Raspberry Pi 5 is an easy device to hide near your TV. And, of course, if you don't end up using it, you only have 450 other things you can do with it.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/embark-studios-announces-the-finals-season-5-coming-december-12/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Today,<a href="https://www.reachthefinals.com/patchnotes/s5teaser" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Embark Studios announced</a> that Season 5 of THE FINALS will be launching on December 12. In this season, there will be a new map, gadgets, weapons, social clubs and sponsors to help spice up the game. This season takes players to the mountainside town of Bernal, which is home to one of the biggest monoliths in the world. This arena features historic cobblestone streets with a vibrant and colorful colonial plaza as the centerpiece of the map. Players will be able to leap across rooftops to find secrets in the nooks and crannies of the map while fighting for survival against their opponents. There are destructible environments to add to the spectacle of the fight, allowing you to strip away Bernal's historic charm and instead turn it into a bullet-ridden ruin.</p>
<p>Embark Studios has released a new trailer for the upcoming season, so that you can see what you can expect from the new season in THE FINALS on December 12.</p>
<p><iframe title="THE FINALS | Season 5 Teaser" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/U9TekVsp_UE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>This season also adds a new way for players to connect with each other. The feature is called Clubs, and is a social system that is inspired by real sports teams. Regardless of whether you're playing solo or you're in a squad, Clubs allow new ways for players to connect with each other, collaborate, or compete. By utilizing Clubs, Contestants can work together to complete challenges as a team using Club Contracts. This will allow you to earn XP and fans, or you can use Team-Up Requests to find teammates for your preferred game mode.</p>
<p>That's not all that players can expect to see in THE FINALS Season 5, as there are some new weapons, including the ShAK-12 and Cerberus 12GA, weapons for the Heavy and Medium classes respectively. Along with weapons being added, there are some new Gadgets, including the Gravity Vortex and Lockbolt Launcher, for the Light and Heavy classes, respectively.</p>
<p>Fan favorite sponsor ISEUL-T returns to Season 5 of THE FINALS, and two brand-new sponsors, DISSUN and VAIYA, join the roster of sponsors. This season, THE FINALS launches on PlayStation 4 for the first time, allowing a whole new audience to experience the game that weren't able to previously. Of course, while there are new items and features being added, Embark Studios has also worked on balancing the game and weapons as needed while adding quality-of-life improvements. Players can now expect support for a 120Hz mode on <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-finals-the-game-awards-shadow-drop/">PS5, PS5 Pro, and Xbox Series</a> X, allowing those on the console to experience the new season of THE FINALS in a smoother performance.</p>

            <p>When I downloaded <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/creeper-world">Creeper World</a> IXE's demo, I had it pegged as a bizarre original. It is, in fact, the latest in a series of real-time strategy games in which you position turrets and terraform maps to repel surging, simulated tides of purple liquid. This is a war between flesh and mineral, solidity and fluidity that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/youre-so-very-ed-special-creeper-world">dates back to the age of Gillen</a>. Alex Wiltshire (RPS in peace) <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/why-creeper-worlds-decade-long-evolution-keeps-getting-harder">interviewed creator Virgil Wall back in 2019</a> - amongst other things, we learn that the original Creeper World was based on a "failure" - and Sin has <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/creeper-world-4-is-a-triumph-of-consistency">an  enthusiastic piece from 2021 about Creeper World 4</a>, the first 3D instalment.</p>
<p>What does Creeper World IXE bring to the party? Well, 1) it ain't 3D, and 2) it's billed as an exercise in "dominating" the titular Creeper, rather than keeping it at bay. For too long has this sloshing, coruscating hooligan been allowed to wash over and corrode our precious starports. We will take the fight to it in the shape of an upgradeable 2D starfleet, equipped with lasers we can use to chisel away the geography and re-rout the flow of villainous Vimto. </p><!--more-->

<p>Hopefully, we will do the aforesaid terraforming while cleverly opening passages to our mission objectives, such as power cores and hibernation pods. It's important to pare away the rock and soil deviously, even artistically - to wield the terraforming shovel like the finest of paintbrushes. But going by my 20 minutes with said demo, there's always the temptation to scrub your cursor back and forth and eradicate the layout, like a child losing patience with an Etch-A-Sketch. Up yours, fluid physics! We will find harmony in our mutual devastation. There will be no World for the Creeper to conquer.</p>
<p>In all seriousness, I'm delighted by this. It makes the factional "asymmetries" of other real-time strategy games look desperately unambitious. The Zerg could learn a thing or two from the Creeper.</p>
<p>While it's labelled real-time strategy, the game often feels closer to <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/noita">Noita</a>, the action-RPG where you spend half the time getting melted by accidentally excavated lakes of acid. There's a similar joy in the arcane applications of particle, sand and fluid physics, with certain combinations of terrain material proving... volatile. Fingers crossed that Creeper World IXE involves teleportation, somehow.</p>
<p>Here's a feature sheet from <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2257010/Creeper_World_IXE/">the Steam page</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>Sand physics terrain where every pixel is simulated allowing the use of gravity and terrain as part of your strategy</p>
<p>Enhanced Creeper fluid simulation with waves creating new Creeper behaviour</p>
<p>Particle system for new and greater threats</p>
<p>Use terrain chemistry and terraforming to gain the advantage over your enemy</p>
<p>Extensive custom unit support with scripting where the community can craft their units, missions and control modules.</p>
<p>Online map database for endless fun and new challenges</p></blockquote>
<p>I'd normally end a piece like this by offering some more direct comparisons, but what can I compare Creeper World to, aside from Noita? <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/from-dust">From Dust</a>? If you know of a parallel, I'd love to hear about it.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Because not only will this be the very first time the game has been made available on <em>any</em> platform since its original release, but it’s <em>the </em>version of <em>Tetris</em> when it comes to the thriving eSports scene.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="194644" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Week In Games: Return To Hyrule" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="165" data-playlist="194644,194328,196626" data-current="194644"><div><p>The Week In Games: Return To Hyrule</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/194644/194644_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/194644/194644_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/194644/194644_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/194644/194644_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/20101.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>The history of <em>Tetris</em> is such an extraordinary tale, so much so that <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetris_(film)&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetris_(film)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2023 saw the release of a hit movie based on the events</a></span>. Its earliest years are a tangled confusion of rights and ownership disputes, culminating in its breakthrough Nintendo versions released for the NES and Game Boy in 1989. (The NES release itself is an astonishing tale, with Atari and Nintendo making rival versions, that somehow saw the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://moneyweek.com/505757/great-frauds-in-history-robert-maxwell&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://moneyweek.com/505757/great-frauds-in-history-robert-maxwell" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">vile, pension-stealing human stain, Robert Maxwell</a></span>, trying to convince Mikhail Gorbachev to cancel Nintendo’s contract!)</p><p>Anyhow, that NES version has since never been re-released or made available on any of Nintendo’s subsequent e-stores. Come December 12, that’s going to change, as the game is added to the teetering pile of emulated classics in the Switch Online subscription service.</p><p>The NES version has become enormously popular thanks to its recent prominence in eSports, especially following 2023's extraordinary series of broken world records, as players saw scores previously thought impossible, and the game’s killscreen was reached for the very first time. All of this is exquisitely documented in a YouTube documentary by Summoning Salt, which <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/the-wild-story-of-tetris-world-records-has-to-be-seen-t-1851484690?_gl=1*8zaqwt*_ga*MTk5MTE1MDYyMi4xNzIyNjAzODYw*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTczMzI0MDM4MS40MDkuMS4xNzMzMjQwMzk1LjQ2LjAuMA..&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/the-wild-story-of-tetris-world-records-has-to-be-seen-t-1851484690?_gl=1*8zaqwt*_ga*MTk5MTE1MDYyMi4xNzIyNjAzODYw*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTczMzI0MDM4MS40MDkuMS4xNzMzMjQwMzk1LjQ2LjAuMA..">Carolyn Petit wrote about last year</a></span>.</p><p>I swear, I’ve only ever been the most casual <em>Tetris</em> player (although, weirdly, I did once get to have a coffee with Alexey Pajitnov and Henk Rogers), and I found this two-hour doc utterly compelling from start to finish. There are <em>so </em>many twists and turns.</p><p>It’ll be fascinating to see how the Switch Online version fares. Presumably, the scene will judge it very closely, given how competitive players have more recently insisted on playing on an original NES cart for the best results. Or they’ll ignore it entirely because everything they’ve built is based on playing with the original NES controller and the nuances of drumming on its rear. Or, you know, regular people might just enjoy a nice game of one of the best versions of <em>Tetris</em>.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Earlier this summer, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/fallout-76-review-no-humans-allowed/1900-6417040/" data-ref-id="1900-6417040">Fallout 76</a> dataminers discovered that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fallout-76-leak-reveals-game-is-probably-getting-a-highly-requested-feature/1100-6524749/" data-ref-id="1100-6524749">camp pets were on the way to the game</a>. Now, as part of the Gleaming Depths update going live today, pets are indeed arriving in the form of a Bombay Cat and a white German Shepherd. And while players can't keep more than one C.A.M.P. pet at a time, they can pet their adorable feline or canine companions.</p><p>The new update is Fallout 76's biggest expansion to date, and also kicks off Season 19: The Scientific Forge. This season is focused on the Enclave, a former "deep-state faction of the United States government" that is now controlled by M.O.D.U.S., an AI supercomputer. M.O.D.U.S. and its followers plan to use science to revitalize the country no matter how many experiments they have to run along the way.</p><p>The arrival of these mad scientists comes with some mad-science weapons including a Tesla Cannon, as well as the Enclave Lab Coat and a M.O.D.U.S. Terminal Vending Machine that can be set up in the player's camp. Some of the other available items include an Enclave Grill Cooking Station and Enclave Hazmat Paint. Players will also be able to use a Plasma Core Recharger instead of buying new plasma cores every time they run out.</p><p>During the Xbox Games Showcase, Microsoft and Bethesda teased that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fallout-76-finally-lets-you-become-a-ghoul-in-2025/1100-6524075/" data-ref-id="1100-6524075">players will be able to control a Ghoul in 2025</a>. That feature isn't included with the new update, but it's something that's on the update calendar for March 2025 with the start of Season 20. The rest of the details about the Gleaming Depths update are below.</p><h2>MUTATED PUBLIC EVENTS UPDATE</h2><p>We have added five public events to the Mutated Public Events playlist.

This is purely a visual change and does not impact the radius in which damage is dealt.A few of these have had sizeable reductions (especially Fatman and Fatman MIRV explosions). Please be sure to provide feedback on whether these changes are sufficient in reducing unwanted screen flashing, if there’s any additional explosions that we should adjust, or if some explosions no-longer feel impactful and satisfying to use.</p><h2>PLAYER WEAPONS</h2><ul><li>Artillery Piece (Workshop)</li><li>Auto Grenade Launcher / M79</li><li>Baseball Grenade</li><li>Broadsider</li><li>Bug Grenade</li><li>Cryo Arrow</li><li>Cryo Grenade</li><li>Cryo Mine</li><li>Explosions (all types) from weapons using the Explosive legendary mod</li><li>Fatman</li><li>Fatman MIRV (from individual projectiles)</li><li>Flaming Arrow</li><li>Floater Flamer Grenade</li><li>Floater Freezer Grenade</li><li>Frag Grenade</li><li>Grand Finale (Broadsider)</li><li>Hack and Slash (Legendary Perk)</li><li>Hellstorm Missile Launcher</li><li>Hellstorm Missile Launcher Cryo Payload</li><li>Hellstorm Missile Launcher Napalm Payload</li><li>Hellstorm Missile Launcher Plasma Payload</li><li>Missile Launcher</li><li>Missile Turret</li><li>Orbital Strike Beacon</li><li>Plasma Grenade</li><li>Pulse Grenade</li><li>Troglocide</li></ul><h2>NPC WEAPONS AND ENVIRONMENTAL EFFECTS</h2><p>NPCs’ use of player weapons listed above will also be affected.</p><ul><li>Exploding Cars &amp; other Civilian Vehicles</li><li>Explosive Rounds from Turrets</li><li>Floater Freezer Death</li><li>Fusion Core Meltdown (Robots)</li><li>Gas Canisters</li><li>Invaders from Beyond UFO Missile Strikes</li><li>Mole Rat Landminer</li><li>Robot Death Explosion</li><li>Scorched Exterminator Plasma Launcher</li><li>Super Mutant Suicider Mini-Nuke</li><li>Turret Death Explosion</li><li>Various destructible objects such as machinery in Grafton Steel and The Foundry (The Pitt)</li><li>Vertibird Death Explosion</li><li>Vertibot Death Explosion</li></ul><h2>COMBAT BALANCE</h2><p>The notes you see below are a continuation of the combat rebalancing work that we began during the Skyline Valley patch.

This allows for more consistency among weapons and mods when making future changes.</p><h2>HUMAN(ISH) CREATURE &amp; WEAPON BALANCE</h2><p>Creatures that previously used player weapons (Blood Eagles, Cultists, Lost, Mole Miners, Raiders, Scorched, and Super Mutants) will now use NPC versions of their weapons with balance adjustments to account for this change (see notes below).When defeated these enemies will have a chance to drop the base version of their weapon alongside some junk items. When a weapon isn’t dropped, the enemy will instead drop more junk items that players can scrap to make up for the loss components you would receive from scrapping these weapons. Increases have also been made to the components earned from scrapping many junk items in the world, so now you will also have more components at your disposal.We have also increased the rate at which you learn mods from scrapping weapons by 10% to account for the lower number of weapons you’ll find from these NPCs. This increase will not affect your chance to learn Legendary weapon mods.</p><ul><li>All creatures previously using player weapons (Blood Eagles, Cultists, Lost, Mole Miners, Raiders, Scorched, Super Mutants):  <ul><li>Weapon damage now scales to level 100.  <ul><li>Dev Note: This brings these enemy types in line with other creatures whose attacks already could scale to level 100.</li></ul></li><li>Thrown grenades now scale with level.  <ul><li>Dev Note: This currently only applies to enemies using grenades. Damage from player grenades is unchanged.</li></ul></li><li>Health, resistances, and damage now scale more smoothly from level 1 to level 100.  <ul><li>Dev Note: These creatures will generally be less threatening at mid-level (especially 35-75) but should be a bit tougher towards level 100. In some cases, at lower level, these creatures may be slightly weaker or stronger in order to ensure that they’re appropriately engaging even when first met.</li></ul></li><li>Power Armor variants’ resistances now scale more appropriately at differing levels.  <ul><li>Dev Note: These creatures previously would gain a flat bonus from Power Armor at all levels and thus could be unexpectedly tough at low-to-mid level.</li></ul></li><li>Resistances differentiated between Blood Eagles, Cultists, and Raiders.</li><li>Now rely more on health as the primary driver of survivability rather than resistances.  <ul><li>Dev Note: Resistances are being used to differentiate damage types rather than as a substitute for health. This has the side benefit of showing higher damage numbers when attacking these creatures which more closely match the weapons being used.</li></ul></li><li>No-longer gains a variable amount of resistances based on randomized armor.</li></ul></li></ul><h2>CREATURE BALANCE</h2><p>The types of health, damage, and resistance adjustments mentioned in the creatures below have also been applied to other creatures as part of earlier updates:</p><ul><li>Floater Freezer  <ul><li>Slightly lowered the duration of the slow effect on the freezing breath attack.</li><li>Reduced the rate at which the slow effect accumulates for the freezing breath attack.</li><li>Reduced damage for the freezing breath attack.</li><li>Reduced the cryo damage for the blast/stare/shockwave attack (the one which also deals fusion core damage).</li></ul></li><li>Floater Flamer  <ul><li>Reduced damage for the fire breath attack.</li></ul></li><li>Floater gnasher  <ul><li>Reduced damage for the bite attack.</li></ul></li><li>Alien Invader  <ul><li>Reduced health</li><li>Reduced damage in Daily Ops.</li></ul></li><li>Lesser Devil  <ul><li>Increased damage.</li></ul></li><li>Bloodbug  <ul><li>Reduced radiation damage at lower levels.</li></ul></li><li>Thrasher  <ul><li>Increased melee attack damage especially at higher levels.</li><li>Decreased Sonic Gobble attack damage at lower levels.</li><li>Now weakest to fire damage and resistant to radiation, energy, and poison damage</li></ul></li><li>Reduced the bonus damage on most creatures’ weak points from 2.0x to 1.5x.</li><li>Health for body parts generally associated with benefits for crippling limbs has been reduced. In many cases, it should be much easier to cripple a creature's limb before dealing enough damage to kill the creature.</li><li>Damage to combat inhibitors for robots and turrets will result in less overall health damage to the robot, but the combat inhibitor can now be destroyed much earlier, before the robot/turret has lost most of its health.</li></ul><h2>ACCESSIBILITY</h2><p>When you enter the game for the first time, you’ll be presented with the Accessibility Menu that includes the new settings you see below. This will only appear once and if you need to change any of these settings in the future, go to Settings &gt; Accessibility.Speech-to-Text</p><ul><li>Turning Speech-to-Text ON will add a new message window to the UI that will transcribe all voice communication from other players in the area.</li><li>Message Window Fade Time – Changes how long the message window stays on screen after the last message has been received.</li><li>Message Window Visibility – Changes the transparency of the message window.</li></ul><p>Screen Narration</p><ul><li>When the setting is ON, you’ll hear the audible description of emotes from other players in the area.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-takes-top-spot-in-revenue-in-october-2024-newzoo-reports/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>It's no surprise that Call of Duty takes the top spot in revenue for the month of October across PC and console, as <a href="https://newzoo.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported by Newzoo</a>. It's not just Black Ops 6 that has boosted the revenue, as Call of Duty Modern Warfare II &amp; III, as well as Call of Duty Warzone, have all contributed to the revenue earnings, helping the franchise take the top spot. In terms of engagement, Call of Duty also did very well for itself, and Black Ops 6 <a href="https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-is-the-biggest-ever-says-activision/">had the most successful launch</a> in the history of the franchise. This is helped by the fact that Black Ops 6 was a day-one release on Xbox Game Pass for the first time ever, helping many people get the opportunity to play the game without having to pay the hefty price tag for the game.</p>
<p>While Call of Duty did take the top spot for revenue and second place for engagement, <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-fortnite-chapter-6-trailer-leaks-early-shows-off-godzilla/">Fortnite</a> continues to retain its position as the most-played game across all platforms. It's likely that we will see Fortnite continue to retain this position in November's report, too. This is because the latest chapter of Fortnite has just been released, meaning there is a ton of new content for players to explore. Additionally, they recently just made the change to battle passes that allows players to get all of the battle passes for a single price, rather than paying for them separately.</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, <a href="https://wccftech.com/roblox-adds-new-child-safety-measures-to-protect-pre-teens/">Roblox</a> is also on both the engagement and revenue top 20. Roblox takes the third position for engagement on all platforms. Considering that this year saw a rise in influencers and streamers playing the game due to the release of Dress to Impress, it's not surprising that the game shot up in the rankings. With the release of that particular experience, gamers of all ages have been flocking to the platform to give the game a go. On top of that, celebrities have also been making appearances in the game, with K-pop groups and singers such as Charli XCX having their own collaborations or meet-and-greet events.</p>
<p>In terms of revenue, two Blizzard Entertainment titles managed to make it onto the top 20 list. World of Warcraft shot up by 138 ranks, securing the third position in PC revenue, which was predominantly driven by the 20th Anniversary Celebration and the release of new content from the recently released <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/world-of-warcraft-the-war-within-better-than-ever/">The War Within expansion</a>. Additionally, Diablo IV saw a significant boost in revenue thanks to the expansion, Vessel of Hatred being released on October 7.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/chivalry-2-torn-banner-layoffs<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Chivalry 2&nbsp;</em>developer Torn Banner has become the latest studio to be hit by the ongoing wave of industry layoffs, following in the footsteps of both indie and major studios alike.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7269735996861091841/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">a post</a> on the official Torn Banner LinkedIn page, CEO Steve Piggott says his studio has made the "very difficult decision to undergo a restructure and reduce some of our talented workforce". Piggott doesn't state how many employees have been laid off.</p>

<p>He puts the layoffs down to Torn Banner being a "fully independent, self-funded developer" that is currently "up against many challenges", describing himself and his studio as "saddened to part ways with some of our incredible team".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/torn-banner-layoffs-chivalry-2-army.jpg?itok=_bgY0Mbz 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/torn-banner-layoffs-chivalry-2-army.jpg?itok=GOA7c0Yc 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Chivalry 2</em>'s Torn Banner is the latest studio to report layoffs.</figcaption></figure><p>With regards to the future of Torn Banner's games, Piggott says that&nbsp;<em>Chivalry 2&nbsp;</em>won't be affected by these layoffs; the game "is not impacted", and servers will remain up as normal. As a reminder,&nbsp;<em>Chivalry 2&nbsp;</em>received its <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/chivalry-2-content-complete" rel="nofollow">final major content update</a> earlier this year.</p>

<p>In addition, Piggott says he and Torn Banner are still committed to working on&nbsp;<em>No More Room in Hell 2</em>, which he says he still believes is "one of the most unique and incredible zombie experiences out there". He goes as far as to call&nbsp;<em>No More Room in Hell 2&nbsp;</em>"central to our goals as a studio".</p>

<p>At time of writing, however, it seems that players are divided on whether they agree with him or not.&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>No More Room in Hell 2&nbsp;</em>is currently <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/292000/No_More_Room_in_Hell_2/#app_reviews_hash" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">sitting at a "Mixed" rating</a> on Steam across over 6,600 reviews, and its 24-hour player peak <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/292000/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">stands at just 228</a>, which isn't a great number for what is supposed to be one of a studio's cornerstone games.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/no-more-room-in-hell-2-torn-banner.jpg?itok=dp3ELhqy 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/no-more-room-in-hell-2-torn-banner.jpg?itok=xl3FcFfx 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>No More Room in Hell 2&nbsp;</em>may not quite be the success Torn Banner had hoped it would be.</figcaption></figure><p>Still, it's entirely possible that with the dedication Piggott seems determined to show to&nbsp;<em>No More Room in Hell 2</em>, the game can be turned around prior to its 1.0 release, which is currently scheduled for next year.</p>

<p>Torn Banner's layoffs are just the latest in a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/this-week-in-gaming-business-june-14th" rel="nofollow">sweeping wave</a> that has been consuming both major industry bodies and smaller studios alike, leading to mass layoffs, project <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/tequila-works-rime-sexy-brutale-layoffs" rel="nofollow">cancellations</a>, and studio <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/piranha-bytes-shut-down-report" rel="nofollow">closures</a>.</p>

        <p>1440p-minded GPUs launch from December, both under $250</p>

            <p>Well slap my backplate and call me CUDA, because not only are Intel’s Arc Battlemage <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-graphics-card">graphics cards</a> not dead – having once been mired in production trouble rumours – but they’ve got names and are out from next week. The CPU makers’ second batch of dedicated gaming GPUs (following the decent budget-end Alchemist series) will comprise the Arc B580, releasing December 13th at $249, and the Arc B570, which arrives on January 16th from $219.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>These prices tell us that Battlemage will, as Alchemist did, attempt to bite into the sub-$250 slice of gaming GPU market share pie that Nvidia and AMD seem content to leave uneaten. This time, however, Intel say they’re aiming for speedy 1440p play, which would suggest a huge performance upgrade over 1080p-focused Alchemist models like the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/intel-arc-a750-review">Arc A750</a>. "Best-in-class performance-per-dollar", no less, according to the <a href="https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/newsroom/news/intel-launches-arc-b-series-graphics-cards.html">marketing bumf</a>.</p>
<p>To that end, the Arc B580 and Arc B570 will come packing more VRAM – 12GB and 10GB respectively – and support for XeSS 2. This is new version of Intel’s upscaler that includes a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dlss-3-how-it-works-how-it-performs-and-when-you-should-use-it">DLSS 3</a>/<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/amd-fsr-3-demystified-how-the-next-gen-upscaler-could-upgrade-performance-on-any-gpu">FSR 3</a>-style frame generation feature, generating inserting interpolated frames "using optical flow and motion vector reprojection". Nice? I think? With all the bells and whistles running, XeSS 2 can supposedly multiply framerate output by by 3.9x, though I’d wait to see this in action before slapping down money for a pre-order. Democratising the advantages of frame generation is a noble goal in the face of Nvidia keeping DLSS 3 support for only its latest RTX 40 series GPUs, but FSR 3 has never quite matched it on visual quality or input lag management. Thus, grudgingly, we must accept some truth in the idea that frame gen needs very specific, cutting-edge hardware to work comfortably.</p>

<p>Anyway, I’m more interested in straight-up, traditionally rendered framerates, and specifically whether Intel really can pull off a proper 60fps@1440p card – or two – at such a low price. Or, as we would have said in 2016 or so, a price. The last few years have seen GPU costs rise, yet the GPU themselves sometimes <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/stalker-2-pc-performance-best-settings">struggling to keep up</a> with the ever-increasing demands of high fidelity games, to the extent that you can easily end up dropping £500/$500 or more to get a truly capable Quad HD engine. We probably can’t expect the Arc B580 to knock the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/nvidia-geforce-rtx-4070-super-review">RTX 4070 Super</a> off its premium perch, but given the dearth of compelling options in the lower budget ranges, I’m certainly willing to watch it take a shot.</p>
<p>In other graphics card news, Nvidia are widely expected to reveal the GeForce RTX 5090 at Las Vegas’ CES show in early January. It will probably cost more than $219. Just a bit.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/delta-force-review-2024<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">“First-person shooter” is a broad term. It can mean everything from a monster-filled horror game like <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2006/10/25/fear-review-2">F.E.A.R.</a>, to a sci-fi adventure like <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/metroid-prime-remastered-review">Metroid Prime</a>, to a demon-eviscerating romp like <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/doom-eternal-final-review">Doom</a>. Even narrowing it down to a label like “military FPS” still puts the linear campaign of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-campaign-review">Call of Duty</a>, the enormous PvP clashes of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-2042-review">Battlefield</a>, and the white knuckle extractions of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/escape-from-tarkov">Escape from Tarkov</a> under a single umbrella. Delta Force, the latest entry in a now 26-year-old shooter series, is probably best defined as a bit of each of those last three – with a dedicated large-scale PvP mode, a separate extraction shooter mode, and an (as yet unreleased) campaign, it sits somewhat awkwardly at the center of a that Venn diagram. It is still too early to render a final verdict, but my initial hours playing ahead of launch have already left me intrigued enough that I’m looking forward to my next deployment on the live servers later this week. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Because this release is technically the start of an indefinite “open beta” (which, for a free-to-play game, really just means it’s out), only two of the three main modes are currently available, with the campaign planned as paid DLC somewhere down the line. Of the two that are here now, the Warfare mode is Delta Force’s answer to the big team combat of Battlefield. 64 players duke it out for supremacy across one of a handful of massive, sprawling arenas. The matches I played in the early review period were focused on the Attack and Defend option within Warfare, though King of the Hill and some other time-based modes are apparently going to be available at launch. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Attack and Defend puts one team on offense, tasked with capturing some strategic points before running out of a finite number of respawns, while the other team defends those areas with limitless lives. If the offense succeeds, they refill their respawns and the cycle begins anew on another part of the map until all of the field is seized or the defense stops them in their tracks. It’s a good setup; initially, the offense has the advantage thanks to favorable terrain and an abundance of vehicles, but things even out as the match progresses and the defense retreats toward their home base. This means each side typically gets to spend some time as both the figurative hammer and the nail. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The battles certainly do feel big, which is a good thing. Fast respawns mean both teams are dense with soldiers. Once the bullets and rockets start flying, the chaos and confusion on the battlefield is exciting. It’s particularly fun when you get behind the controls of a vehicle and start running roughshod over the other team. A tank fully loaded with gunners can dominate, but don’t sleep on the impact of a simple machine gun turret on the top of an armored car. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Abilities are helpful in battle, but won't outright win a skirmish.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Thankfully, the times I’ve found myself on the wrong end of that tank barrel I haven’t been totally helpless thanks to the varied operatives you can choose from mid-match. These named characters act as a sort of hybrid between a simple loadout choice and a bespoke hero, which fits the jack-of-all-trades theme persistent throughout Delta Force. If you are being overrun by vehicles, it might be a good idea to spawn with a rocket launcher, or if the fight is taking place in open spaces, it could be time to bust out the trusty sniper rifle. Each character has unique abilities that are helpful in battle too, like Luna’s Detection Arrows that can periodically be fired to reveal enemies, but none are so powerful as to outright win a skirmish, let alone a whole match, for you. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">I just wish the actual action felt better. Bullet arc and trajectory factor heavily into shooting, so leading your targets is essential for firing accurately at a distance. That, combined with a fast time-to-kill, makes for gunplay more in the spirit of a military sim like <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/arma-reforger-review">Arma</a>. That’s all well and good on its own, but feels deeply at odds with the aggressive pace of play that the objective-based Attack and Defend mode drives. Slow bullets at the mercy of gravity that kill you instantly feel a little too airsoft-like for an intense battle over a key chokepoint. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h2 data-cy="title2">Get in, get loot, get out</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">On the other side of things, the Operations mode follows the familiar extraction shooter framework; you and up to two friends can form a three-person squad to enter an area, shoot, loot, and scoot. Whatever you bring back to your base between rounds you can either sell, store, or use in the next attempt, and whatever is on you if you die or don’t escape in time is lost for good. It’s a tried-and-true formula that Delta Force follows to the letter, but the high quality of its execution makes up for that unoriginality. q</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Each level is an open sandbox that is dense with potential objectives. Maps easily highlight points of interest for things like bounty targets, safes to plunder, and intel to decode. That might seem like a small detail to praise, but in a genre dominated by games like Escape from Tarkov that are designed to be intentionally opaque, making important information accessible is a nice differentiator. I like being able to just drop a waypoint and know what I’m in for when I get there without having to memorize the maps. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>So far I’m a fan of the enemy variety in the Operations mode.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Once you pick your destination, you’ll need to shoot your way through squads of AI soldiers, and occasionally human-controlled enemies. You never know who’s around, or in what numbers, so every enemy encounter starts with some fast risk assessment: do you take the shot and risk letting everyone know where you are, or do you sneak by for the stealthy approach, leaving a potential threat on the field? Making quick decisions with limited information does a good job of keeping the action strategic and interesting. That’s particularly true if you see other people, as they are certainly more dangerous than the bots, but could be loot-rich targets worth taking on. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">So far I’m a fan of the enemy variety. My squad has taken down roving bands of riflemen, ducked into buildings to avoid sniper fire, and executed on-the-fly flanking maneuvers to get around riot shields. One memorable moment saw my team pinned down by a massive armored baddie blasting at us with a minigun as we lobbed grenades from behind cover. Another time, a member of our trio was cracking a safe while the other squadmate and I provided cover, and I almost jumped out of my chair when a giant alligator came around the corner and tried to put a stop to our fun. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">My primary worry about Operations at this point is the loop loot. There are all sorts of containers everywhere, like file cabinets, coat pockets, fallen enemies, etc. – but after just a few hours with the mode, I rarely bother to check them anymore now that I have a good idea of where to go for the actual high-ticket items. I’m hopeful there won’t be a point where the maps feel “solved” anytime soon, but they are already feeling less dynamic with each run. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The time between them is spent at the Black Site, which functions as your home base. This is where you buy, sell, and make upgrades, particularly to the amount of storage space in your stash. It’s also where you manage the well-built loadouts option. This lets you save a few different kits you can take into battle and rebuild them with just a few clicks. Pieces will be pulled from your inventory first, and then automatically purchased from the store as needed. It’s a fast and slick way to get back in the action, which helps take the sting out of a failed extraction. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Of course, these are all still just my initial impressions - it takes time to get a comprehensive feel for how well a PvP mode like Warfare is working, and there are still a few Operations I haven’t explored, so I’m not quite ready to give a final verdict until I’ve played on the live servers. However, I can say that the extraction mode is a lot of fun in the early going, and I enjoy the scale of Delta Force’s PvP encounters even if I’m not yet sold that this style of gunplay is the right match for that action. It’s at least clear this is a competent free-to-play shooter that can cater to a few different FPS tastes, but it remains to be seen if it has the staying power to keep my interest once the initial novelty wears off. </p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>
