			<p>Hordes of Hunger bills itself as being a survival arena slasher, and while you do indeed run around murking a bunch of enemies in all sorts of shapes and sizes, and you do level up as you go, it’s a bit more hands-on than most in the genre. That’s not a bad thing at all, but it means that, to me at least, it feels more like a roguelike Dynasty Warriors game… sort of.</p>
<p><iframe title="Hordes of Hunger - Official Release Date Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NSSAlmeW_Ws?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Hordes of Hunger bills itself as a roguelite arena-slasher, but it’s a bit more than that. Borrowing a cup of sugar from the roguelite’s neighbours in the bullet heaven household brings regular levelling up through a run into the mix, as well as the larger hordes of enemies to battle. It feels to me like a roguelite spin on Dynasty Warriors… sort of.</p>


<p>You take control of Mirah, a woman on a mission to kill just about everything she sees, because they’re all really hungry and trying to eat you. It basically means there are a lot of monsters to attack, and while they start off just sort of running at you, they’ll quickly end up trying to explode you, debuffing you with magic, and leaping across the map at you. It’s a simple enough premise, and it’s a simple enough game as well.</p>


<p>Instead of the auto-attacks of a Bullet Heaven game, you have to hold down a button to unleash a string of standard attacks, which will have you Geralting around the map with your sword swinging, or whatever other weapon you end up crafting. You also get a heavy attack which requires focus, which you get from hitting things, and a special attack which charges up over time. You’ve got a dodge and parry too, which end up feeling very relevant if you want to actually stay alive.</p>
<p>The dash is especially good, because healing is hard to come by, and one of the level up perks you get lets you heal for each enemy you dash past, which can keep you alive pretty comfortably. Things don’t get a huge amount more complicated than that, which is fine, although some of your level-ups can buff your other abilities, like granting a lightning strike to your jump attack.</p>

<p>With all of that at your disposal, you have to run around different levels completing missions, like destroying cranes or beating up bosses, and just keep doing that for each level. You’re going to die a fair bit – it is a roguelite, my friends – as getting surrounded is fatal, and because each and every new level brings some new enemy to ruin your day. The ones with shields can only be hurt by heavy attacks or special attacks, or lightning bolts.</p>
<p>It’s a fun little loop, as these games so often are, but it’s not doing much beyond that, and the progression feels a little sluggish. A lot of Survivor-likes are sort of carried by the sheer absurdity of your weapons and the things you can weave together, but Hordes of Hunger is a bit more grounded in it’s overall look and feel. That leads to the gameplay feeling a little bit more muted, and because progression is slow on top of that, with you buying passive buffs and crafting weapons sometimes, it just isn’t very inspiring.</p>

		I like Hordes of Hunger, but I don't love it, and in a field of games that are a lot like this, it's hard to recommend. That being said, if you're someone who wants to indulge in a grimdark fantasy world and hit things a lot, this could be a good chance to do so.	</p></div>

<p>It's the little things</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>If you cast your mind back to 2024, you might recall an adorable-looking little game called <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/tiny_garden">Tiny Garden</a>, which <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2024/07/cosy-polly-pocket-inspired-farm-sim-tiny-garden-smashes-kickstarter-goal-in-one-hour">smashed its Kickstarter goal</a> in under an hour with the promise of a Switch release to come. Well, guess what! It's coming our way real soon.</p>
<p>Super Rare Originals and Ao Norte have today announced that Tiny Garden will sprout onto the Switch eShop on <strong>26th February</strong>, bringing us heaps of '90s nostalgia and cosy vibes in the process.</p>
<p>In case you missed it, this is a cute farming/decoration sim, set inside a "'90s inspired clam-shelled toy" — if you remember your ample Polly Pocket collection from back in the day, this'll likely ring a bell. The bottom half of this toy is your garden, where you'll plant crops before turning the little handle on the side to watch them grow (<em>adorable</em>), while the top is a tiny little house for you to decorate as you please.</p>
<p>After launching on Steam last year, the Switch version bundles in the Summer Breeze Cosmetic Pack DLC and Supporter's Pack, meaning even more cosmetics and items will be at your disposal right from the jump.</p>
<p>Here's a brief rundown of the game's key features and a handful of screenshots from Super Rare:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>- <strong>Pocket-Sized! -</strong> Build your dream garden inside this 90's inspired clam-shelled toy.<br>
- <strong>Relax, Discover, Create -</strong> Turn the crank and enjoy a wholesome and thoughtful experience!<br>
- <strong>Relaxation and Creativity -</strong> No score, time limits, or game overs, Tiny Garden is all about unwinding and creating without pressure!<br>
- <strong>A Toy With History -</strong> Discover the toys secrets as you uncover letters and traces of the stories shared within.<br>
- <strong>Nintendo Switch version includes the Summer Breeze Cosmetic Pack</strong>, which brings new customisations to your game!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>All in all, it looks <em>ridiculously cute</em>. We're all after an antidote to the endless grey outside, and this might just provide it.</p>

			<p>After a bombastic launch that saw <strong>Battlefield 6</strong> become the best-selling shooter of 2025 and the <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-best-selling-game-in-us-2025/">best-selling game in the US overall</a></strong> in 2025, enthusiasm waned around <strong>EA's</strong> successful <strong>Call of Duty-killer</strong> as the assembled team of developers known as <strong>Battlefield Studios</strong> was unable to keep up with players' thirst for new content.</p>



<p>It went from a game that had a chance of cracking 1 million concurrent players on Steam alone to one that has been struggling to hit <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2807960/charts/">100K concurrent players</a>. Thankfully, though, after an <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-season-2-release-date-january-update-ea/">unwelcome delay</a>, EA and Battlefield Studios may finally start to have better luck, as <strong>Season 2</strong> for Battlefield 6 is finally just days away, and EA has officially revealed what's coming in this new season.</p>



<p>Ahead of the official reveal, I got the chance to check out a short presentation detailing what's coming in Season 2, as well as the chance to spend some time with the new content. For now, I can't talk about my thoughts on Season 2 and the new content, and you'll be able to read those in the coming days. If you want a peek at what that might sound like, <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-season-1-hands-on-preview/">you can check out my preview of Season 1</a> or my review of Battlefield 6 to find out more about <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/battlefield-6-battlefield-is-mostly-back/">my thoughts on the game</a>. In the meantime, here are all of the details for what's coming in Season 2.</p>

<h2 id="h-battlefield-6-season-2-breakdown">Battlefield 6 Season 2 Breakdown</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Battlefield-6-S2-Roadmap-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image credit: EA</em></figcaption></figure>



<h3 id="h-leadoff-extreme-measures">Leadoff - Extreme Measures</h3>



<p>Like its initial season, Season 2 will be broken into three phases. This time, they're called <strong>Extreme Measures, Nightfall, </strong>and <strong>Hunter/Prey</strong>. Extreme Measures kicks off Season 2, and it's easily the most jam-packed phase of the three. It adds a new map, new weapons, new gadgets, and new vehicles, including the fan-favourite <strong>AH-6 Little Bird</strong> helicopter.</p>



<p>Extreme Measures launches with the arrival of Season 2 and lasts from <strong>February 17, 2026</strong>, to <strong>March 17, 2026,</strong> and brings with it a new feature that players are desperate for: a new map. The new <strong>Contaminated</strong> map launches with Extreme Measures, which brings players to Germany's more mountainous corners, with rocky terrain surrounding a German airbase.</p>



<p>Along with the new map, the other major feature arriving in Extreme Measures is a new limited-time mode, <strong>VL-7 Strike.</strong> This mode covers the map with a hallucinogenic smoke that will have you unable to see what's in front of you, while also seeing and hearing things that aren't really there. You can wear a gas mask to keep yourself from hallucinating, but that doesn't fix how thick the gas is in the first place.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Battlefield-6-S2-Screenshot-2-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image credit: EA</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>As for the new weapons getting introduced in Extreme Measures, players will get their hands on three new weapons. A new assault rifle, the <strong>VC-2</strong>. It's a rifle that thrives in close-quarters engagements, and it's capable of burning through enemies. The <strong>M121 A2</strong> is a new belt-fed light machine gun joining the arsenal, and lastly, the <strong>GRT-CPS</strong> is a new semi-automatic DMR.</p>



<p>Engineers are getting a new guided missile launcher gadget, the <strong>9K38 IGLA,</strong> while Recon players will be getting the <strong>HTI-Mk2,</strong> a device that can detect enemy gadgets, suppress enemy recon drones, and disrupt enemy rockets. The only vehicle added to the game in Extreme Measures is the aforementioned Little Bird helicopter.</p>



<h3 id="h-what-s-on-deck-nightfall">What's on Deck - Nightfall</h3>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Battlefield-6-S2-Screenshot-4-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image credit: EA</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Picking up right where Extreme Measures leaves off, <strong>Nightfall</strong> starts on <strong>March 17, 2026, </strong>and runs until <strong>April 14, 2026</strong>. It'll add the second and last map included in Battlefield 6's second season, <strong>Hagental Base</strong>, and introduce a new limited-time mode, also called Nightfall.</p>



<p>Hagental Base is already a dimly lit place, and there will be plenty of chances for you to use the darkness to your advantage. The map's lighting gets remixed and, almost entirely turned off in the Nightfall LTM, where you're battling against enemy squads in pitch black corridors, as the map is limited to the facility within the mountain range.</p>



<p>All players will have the option of bringing Night Vision Goggles with them in their loadout, but your choice between using NVGs or just a flashlight, which could very well blind an unaware NVG-user, could be the difference between winning or losing a fight. The Nightfall LTM will also be available in REDSEC as a mode in Gauntlet, outside of the vanilla multiplayer.</p>



<p>Two new weapons will be added in Nightfall (the phase), the <strong>CZ3A1</strong> submachine gun, and the <strong>VC.61</strong> fully-automatic sidearm. Both have a high fire rate, making them ideal for close encounters, like the kind you might not see coming until the last second, because you can't see what's in front of you.</p>



<p>Nightfall also introduces a new vehicle, the <strong>M1030 Dirt Bike</strong>. You and a squadmate can jump on the back of the bike and cut across a map even faster than before, trying to hit a sick jump and a sick shot at the same time.</p>



<h3 id="h-in-the-hole-hunter-prey">In the Hole - Hunter/Prey</h3>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Battlefield-6-S2-Screenshot-6-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image credit: EA</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>The last phase of Season 2, <strong>Hunter/Prey</strong>, kicks off on <strong>April 14, 2026, </strong>and is the thinnest phase in terms of content. Or, that's how it seems at the moment, that is. During the presentation, EA did clarify that there is more to the phase than what they've shown so far, as there's currently no indication that Hunter/Prey adds a new map.</p>



<p>Season 1 did add three maps altogether, so maybe there's a third waiting in the wings. What we do know is that coming in Hunter/Prey is another limited-time mode, <strong>Operation Augur.</strong> It's a new mode directly inspired by the Operations introduced in <strong>Battlefield 1,</strong> and it features both of Season 2's new maps, Hagental Base and Contaminated.</p>



<p>It begins on Contaminated, with the attackers driving an assault while using VL-7 gas to push the defenders into Hagental Base, where the battle concludes in infantry-based warfare. Hunter/Prey also adds a new <strong>LTV</strong> vehicle, a new 14" <strong>Ripper</strong> machete melee weapon, and a new unnamed weapon, though that's about all we know at the moment.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[High On Life 2′s Intro Is One Of The Best Video Game Openings Ever]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/high-on-life-2-intro-start-epstein-files-fps-sci-fi-montage-2000668195</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Some games start slow, taking their time to teach you the controls and establish the world. <a href="https://kotaku.com/high-on-life-2-trailer-teaser-xbox-game-pass-sgf-2025-1851783996"><em>High On Life 2</em></a> takes a very different approach. It tosses you into the world at 1,000 MPH, cracking jokes and having a blast. And you know what, it’s a great way to start a video game.</p> <p><em>High On Life 2</em> doesn’t assume that you’ve played its <a href="https://kotaku.com/high-on-life-review-rick-and-morty-justin-roiland-1849888587">2022 predecessor</a>. Instead, the intro to this <a href="https://kotaku.com/high-on-life-squanch-games-rick-and-morty-justin-roilan-1849949995">comedy-filled sci-fi FPS</a> about humans being turned into drugs provides a crash course on what happened in the last game. It does this via an intro that is structured as a series of vignettes and moments seamlessly stitched together into one extended opening montage.</p>

 <p>At one point you’re fighting a giant monster, then you’re on a talk show, a second later you’re back in a limo with your mentor-turned-agent from the original game, then back to the monster fight. A quick cut later, you’re doing a commercial, then you’re zipped away to an obstacle course, back to the talk show, and so on.</p> <p>This introduction sequence isn’t just fun and funny; it also does a great job of teaching you the basics of <em>High On Life 2</em>. You know, how to jump, move, shoot, grapple stuff, melee people, etc. Learning how to jump and run on a <em>Wipeout</em>-like televised obstacle course and then seconds later, though possibly years later in-game, using those skills to climb across buildings as you chase a giant monster not only taught me the controls, it also quickly established what the main character has been doing since the first game. On top of that, it’s all technically impressive and fun to behold as the game hops between wildly different scenes in a few frames without hitching up or breaking.</p>

  <p>And yes, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/high-on-life-2-jeffrey-epstein-joke/">as already pointed out by <em>Polygon</em></a>, there is a joke about deceased sex offender Jeffrey Epstein in the intro sequence. It happens during a bit in which you kill a bunch of different targets in a hyper-fast murder montage that teaches you how to melee while also showing how bored the main character has become with their life as a celebrity bounty hunter. You can kill these people instantly, or let them ramble on for a bit and learn more about why they are marked for death. In the case of one character, they trafficked humans, but not for “sex stuff” like Epstein. They just sold humans to be smoked as a drug by aliens. They want to be clear; they are bad, but not as bad as Epstein.</p>

 <p>This is when I’d show you a clip from this awesome intro, but I can’t do that. <em>High On Life 2</em> has a lot of embargoed content that I’m unable to talk about ahead of its February 13 launch. And we aren’t able to share video or record clips of the introduction sequence at all. It’s a shame, because I don’t think it spoils much, and it’s one of the best parts of <em>High On Life 2.&nbsp;</em></p>

The rumor of their impending rerelease began when Khu, a leaker in the </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>community, claimed that the games would “return soon” on </span><a href="https://x.com/Riddler_Khu/status/2021518874785841331"><span>X</span></a><span>.</span></p>

They also claim they will be compatible with </span><i><span>Pokémon Home</span></i><span>, which allows you to transfer your Pokémon to a storage app that can be traded to other games in the series.</span></p> <p><i><span>FireRed </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>LeafGreen</span></i><span> are easily the best versions of the first-generation games, but fans have gotten a bit weary of going back to the Kanto region after years of perceived favoritism for those original 151 Pokémon. So while there’s plenty of excitement about the possibility, some folks are rolling their eyes at the thought that these games might be ported over while&nbsp; plenty of the other games continue missing from the Switch’s line-up. Especially if they end up being pricey, standalone games.</span></p>

 <p><span>“Big news for Kantoids,” wrote one </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1r1ut4f/khu_hints_pok%C3%A9mon_fire_red_and_leaf_green_will/"><span>Redditor</span></a><span>. “Just give me </span><i><span>HGSS</span></i><span>,” wrote another. “</span><i><span>FireRed</span></i><span> and </span><i><span>LeafGreen</span></i><span> will return in </span><i><span>Avengers: Doomsday</span></i><span>,” is the top comment on the GamingLeaksAndRumors subreddit thread about the leak, indicating that a lot of folks feel like they’re being subjected to some MCU-style nostalgia-baiting here and aren’t thrilled at the prospect of going back to Kanto. So some folks might be skipping this if it comes to pass.</span></p>

 <p><span>This is all just a rumor right now, but it would make some sense considering 2026 is </span><i><span>Pokémon</span></i><span>’s 30th anniversary. It doesn’t seem out of the question that The Pokémon Company would want to give folks a way to play that first adventure. The original </span><i><span>Red </span></i><span>and</span><i><span> Blue</span></i><span> were last available on the 3DS, but now that the eShop on that device has been shut down, you can only download them if you’ve previously purchased them.</span></p> <p><span>For a series with as much continuity as </span><i><span>Pokémon</span></i><span> has through intergenerational trading and </span><i><span>Home </span></i><span>support, it’s really shitty that all these games aren’t readily accessible on modern hardware, but Nintendo has a way of making it hard to play old games without some kind of (usually expensive) port or subscription service on its current platforms. So if this does turn out to be true, I wouldn’t be surprised if </span><i><span>FireRed </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>LeafGreen</span></i><span> end up costing something like $30 a piece. But we’ll know for sure on Pokémon Day.</span></p>

<p>Overwatch developers are asking players not to ban Jetpack Cat, as players get tired of the overpowered character’s abilities. </p>



<p>Overwatch came in guns blazing for their latest <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-new-content-in-overwatch-season-1-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Season 1 update</a>, introducing 5 new Heroes to the title, including Domina, Emre, Mizuki, Anran, and Jetpack Cat. Along with that, new sub-roles for the core roles and a bunch of other content were revealed. Today, we are talking about one of the newly released characters. </p>







<h2 id="h-overwatch-s-jetpack-cat-seems-to-be-too-overpowered">Overwatch’s Jetpack Cat Seems to be Too Overpowered</h2>



<p>Overwatch has just posted on their official <a href="https://x.com/PlayOverwatch/status/2021774745243726021" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> account (formerly Twitter), “NO BAN JETPACK CAT PLZ” with a very innocent image of the character. Many players in the comments section don’t agree with the developers, stating they will continue to ban the character, while others request a balance in the character’s skills. Some players seem to agree, chiming in with the ‘don’t ban Jetpack Cat’ chants. </p>



<figure></figure>



<p>There is a full-fledged Reddit post on r/<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Competitiveoverwatch/comments/1r1iuj4/jetpack_cat_has_a_massive_issue/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Competitiveoverwatch</a>, discussing how the character can be a big problem in competitive games. It seems that Jetpack Cat excels at close and midrange duels and can disengage easily. What’s more, their ultimate attack is considered a guaranteed tank killer, and the Tether ability can be a game-changer as well. Many players have said they want the character permanently banned until changes are made. </p>

<p>In other news, Overwatch’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/overwatchs-anran-set-for-redesign-after-community-backlash/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Anran is getting a redesign</a> after receiving community backlash. Additionally, Fortnite’s Overwatch crossover is bringing <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-x-overwatch-crossover-brings-genji-tracer-d-va/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Genji, Mercy, Tracer, and D.Va as new skins</a>.

            <title><![CDATA[ARC Raiders Hits 14M Copies Sold, Drove “Record-High Q4 and Full-Year Revenue” for Nexon with 25% YoY Increase]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/arc-radiers-14m-copies-sold-record-high-revenue-nexon/</link>
            <guid>1433623</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p><strong>Nexon</strong> has just reported its<a href="https://www.nexon.co.jp/en/ir/"> fourth-quarter 2025 financials,</a> and, unsurprisingly, the company recorded "<em>record-high Q4 and full-year revenue</em>." The thing that makes it no surprise is the fact that Nexon is the parent company of <strong>Embark Studios</strong>, the team behind the hottest new extraction shooter, <strong>ARC Raiders</strong>. Which we now know has officially sold <strong>14 million copies</strong> since it launched in October 2025.</p>



<p>This official sales update comes after a recent report that ARC Raiders was the top-selling game across Steam, Xbox, and PlayStation for <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/arc-raiders-dominance-continues-reportedly-stands-as-top-selling-game-across-steam-xbox-and-playstation-for-third-consecutive-month/">a third consecutive month</a></strong>. It also means that the game sold just under <strong>2M</strong> copies in the last month, since Embark confirmed the game had <a href="https://wccftech.com/arc-raiders-sold-more-than-12-million-copies-neared-1-million-concurrent/">sold 12.4 million copies in January</a>.</p>



<p>The success of ARC Raiders helped drive a <strong>25% year-on-year (YoY)</strong> revenue increase for Nexon, with the company's overall revenue reaching <strong>$3.1 billion.</strong> Though Embark's popular shooter isn't the only story behind the company's record revenues (though, admittedly, it is most of the story).</p>



<p>It's the <strong>MapleStory</strong> franchise that drove growth outside of ARC Raiders, with the new release of <strong>MapleStory: Idle RPG</strong> driving growth after remaining the number one game on app stores for more than <strong>10 weeks.</strong></p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Nexon-Q42025-Financial-Report.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image credit: Nexon</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Embark Studios' other shooter, <strong>The Finals</strong>, wasn't a slouch while the new third-person extraction shooter took most of the glory. Revenue from The Finals also grew compared to the last fiscal year, with a significant chunk of that growth coming in December thanks to the game's <a href="https://wccftech.com/embark-studios-the-finals-season-9-dragon-rising/"><strong>Season 9</strong> update.</a></p>



<p>Looking ahead, Nexon lists eight games in development, half of them being new IPs, while the rest are new games in the <strong>Dungeons and Fighters</strong>, the <strong>Mabinogi: Heroes</strong>, and <strong>Durango</strong> franchises. </p>



<ul>
<li>Azur Promilia - new IP published by Nexon - fantasy world RPG</li>



<li>Project DX - new Durango-based game developed/published by Nexon - MMORPG</li>



<li>Project RX - new IP developed/published by Nexon - anime-style game</li>



<li>Vindictus: Defying Fate - new Mabinogi: Heroes-based game developed/published by Nexon - action RPG</li>



<li>Nakwon: Last Paradise - new IP developed/published by Nexon - extraction survival game</li>



<li>Woochi: The Wayfarer - new IP developed/published by Nexon - action adventure</li>



<li>Dungeon &amp; Fighter: Arad - new Dungeon &amp; Fighter game developed/published by Nexon - open-world action RPG</li>



<li>Project Overkill - new Dungeon &amp; Fighter game developed/published by Nexon - 3D action RPG</li>
</ul>



<p>The rumoured <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/nexon-starcraft-shooter-blizzard-entertainment/">StarCraft</a></strong> game said to be in development at Nexon is not mentioned, though that's not exactly a surprise since whatever is happening with StarCraft likely won't be revealed until BlizzCon 2026. And if it was spoiled in a financial report, that would be more than a little anticlimactic.</p>

<p>When it comes to Nexon's other franchises, the popular <em>Dungeon&amp;Fighter </em>franchise grew in both China and Korea on PC, although <em>Dungeon&amp;Fighter Mobile </em>is struggling somewhat. The <em>MapleStory </em>franchise, meanwhile, seems to be going from strength to strength across all of its iterations.</p><p><em>The First Descendant</em>, meanwhile, served as Nexon's third best-selling franchise in North America and Europe, coming in behind the aforementioned <em>MapleStory </em>and <em>Arc Raiders</em>.

<p>Blizzard whipped out these reveals over the course of nearly 40 minutes, during which phrases like "abducting people to drink in the anguish of an entire world" were said. Kicking off with the Diablo 4, the Lord of Hatred expansion set to arrive on April 28th will include a new warlock class that the devs are painting as the final stage in an evolution of the magic wielder's abilities across the other entries in the series it's also being added into.</p>
<p>"In Diablo 2: Resurrected, they hone their earliest arcane powers," explained associate game director Zaven Haroutunian. "Then, in Diablo Immortal, their journey takes a rebellious turn, embracing darker forces and forging their own path. Now, in Diablo 4, the Warlock stands at the height of their strength, fully unleashed and ready to shape the fate of Sanctuary.</p><p>"This class is all about turning the wrath of Hell against itself, with metal chains, flames, and utter destruction," he continued. "The Diablo 4 warlock is like a heavy metal album cover come to life, fighting fire with fire." Blizzard also indicated the contrast between these Metallica-loving mages and the expansion's new Paladin class are key to its story, which is all about Mephisto doing shadow-elongating stuff.</p>
<p>The addition of warlocks to Diablo 2 comes as part of a second expansion for it that's arriving after a 25 year wait. Dubbed Reign of the Warlock, the DLC boasts "an overhauled endgame, fresh mechanics, and modern quality-of-life updates" in addition to the titular new class. It's also packaged by default with the infernal edition of Diablo 2: Resurrected Blizzard have just <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2536520/Diablo_II_Resurrected__Infernal_Edition/">ported to Steam</a>, with it previously having lived on Battle.net since release in 2021.</p>
<p>That said, a Battle.net account and the Battle.net desktop app remain requirements to play the Steam version of Resurrected, because life can't all be sunshine and publisher-specific launcher free rainbows.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/resident-evil-4-remake-pc-drm-denuvo-steam-review-2000668182</link>
            <guid>1433614</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/resident-evil-4-re4-remaster-remake-review-capcom-ps5-1850278891">The Resident<em> Evil 4</em> remake</a> came out three years ago, so you’d think its performance on PC would be pretty locked in at this point. Instead, Capcom recently swapped out the game’s DRM for new anti-tamper software and the horror shooter is running noticeably worse as a result.</p> <p>The impact of a recent switch from Denuvo DRM to Enigma DRM was recorded last week in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DMDx-3PFYgc">one YouTube video</a> published by user ItalicMaze. <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/residentevil42023/mods/5667">Using a mod</a> that allows you to restore the game’s previous version, the video compares the two and shows the framerate dropping from over 140 in the earlier version to in the low 90s in the updated release, with both running on similar settings. The drop-off was even worse when Leon was in more action-heavy moments with lots of enemies.</p>

 <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N0TTbdff_vE"><em>Digital Foundry</em> circled back</a> on February 11 and posted its own assessment, essentially backing up the preliminary data. Using specific settings to try to isolate the load on the CPU, the outlet found that the new DRM was likely causing increased strain. “In this scenario, an average 1.9ms of CPU time is sucked out of the game-which is pretty shocking,” <a href="https://www.digitalfoundry.net/news/2026/02/tested-resident-evil-4-remakes-new-pc-drm-impacts-cpu-performance">wrote</a> Richard Leadbetter. “Immediately after the intro, we move into gameplay where the deficit shifts to a 20 percent drop in performance.”</p>  <p>He calls the result “not acceptable” and points to a larger issue of publishers treating PC versions of games as “mutable testbeds” they can constantly iterate on, sometimes without regard for how changes will impact the overall user experience. The group also notes that when DRM is used, its resource requirements should be budgeted into the game’s performance targets from the start, rather than being something added on top at the end that leads to a subpar experience.</p>

 <p>Steam users have been venting that exact frustration on the game’s store page with hundreds of negative reviews published over the last week. The <em>Resident Evil 4 </em>remake&nbsp;still has a rating of “Very Positive,” but the mini-protest has already dropped it from a previous peak of 96 percent positive down to 82 percent. A few points more and it’ll drop into the dreaded “yellow” territory of Steam user review ratings.</p>

 <p>With <em>Resident Evil Requiem</em> right around the corner, all eyes will be on whether one of the most wishlisted games on Steam can avoid the PC performance debacle of last year’s Capcom blockbuster <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em>. That game has finally turned a corner but it took nearly a year to get decent framerates on anything but top-tier rigs.</p>

<p>A new claim states that Kingdom Hearts is coming to Fortnite in the coming months. </p>



<p>Fortnite has a lot of collaborations in the works for this year, some we have already heard about, and others are still in the leaks and rumours stage. It seems the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-x-overwatch-crossover-brings-genji-tracer-d-va/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Overwatch</a> one is pretty close, since the collaboration’s characters have been revealed. However, the rumoured <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-rumored-to-be-working-on-a-minecraft-collab/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Minecraft collab</a> has yet to be announced. We have now received information about another game collab. </p>







<h2 id="h-fortnite-x-kingdom-hearts-arriving-in-the-coming-months">Fortnite x Kingdom Hearts Arriving in the Coming Months</h2>



<p>The leak about Fortnite x Kingdom Hearts comes from Fortnite leaker AdiraFNInfo on <a href="https://x.com/AdiraFNInfo" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (formerly Twitter), reposted by reliable <a href="https://x.com/ShiinaBR/status/2021768076199440527">ShiinaBR</a>. The leak states that the collaboration is already in active development and should arrive in the “next months”. ShiinaBR added that they had recently heard this information from multiple leakers, each with different sources. It is also speculated that it will be 3 more months before an official announcement for this collab.  </p>



<p>Kingdom Hearts is a popular action RPG series developed by Square Enix, and Disney owns the IP. It features a crossover of various Disney and Square Enix properties, with the main narrative centered on Sora and characters from both universes. The series consists of 13 games across multiple platforms, so it will be hard to tell what they might choose for the Fortnite collaboration. </p>







<p>In other news, Embark Studios has confirmed that ARC Raiders won’t get Fortnite-style skin collaborations <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-wont-have-fortnite-skins-protect-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in a bid to keep the game grounded</a>. Additionally, Fortnite’s Chapter 7 Season 2 has been <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-chapter-7-season-2-delayed-by-over-two-weeks/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">delayed by over two weeks</a>.

  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p>FromSoftware's parent company Kadokawa has confirmed both The Duskbloods and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-walkthrough-8042">Elden Ring</a>: Tarnished Edition are still planned to release on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Switch 2</a> this year.</p>
<p>Elden Ring was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-is-coming-to-switch-2">first revealed to be coming to Switch 2 last year</a>, though a release date was notably absent from the announcement beyond 2025. That has - clearly - now passed, with the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-elden-ring-tarnished-edition-delayed-to-2026-to-allow-time-for-performance-adjustments">release window of the Nintendo Switch 2's Elden Ring port pushed back to "allow time for performance adjustments"</a>.</p>
<p>Many had then hoped to hear a release date for Elden Ring: Tarnished Edition, as it is known, earlier this month, when <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-partner-direct-announced-so-will-we-finally-hear-an-elden-ring-switch-release-date-or-more-about-the-duskbloods">Nintendo hosted a Direct with a third-party focus</a>. But alas, we did not hear anything here.</p>
<p>As for The Duskbloods, this rather eclectic offering that includes jet packs and dinosaurs <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fromsoftwares-the-duskbloods-is-bloodborne-meets-sekiro-meets-dark-souls-with-jetpacks-and-dinos-thrown-in">is a "PvPvE title with online multiplayer"</a>, which features up to eight participants vying for "supremacy among themselves and against challenging foes". It's a Nintendo exclusive and again, we had hoped to hear more during that aforementioned Direct, but again we did not.</p><p>But thankfully though for those in the middle of the Nintendo/FromSoft venn diagram, both these titles are still on track to arrive this year. Kadokawa just released its latest <a href="https://ssl4.eir-parts.net/doc/9468/ir_material_for_fiscal_ym13/198090/00.pdf">financial results</a> and shared in its Future Outlook that FromSoftware currently has multiple games in the development pipeline, specifically The Duskbloods and Elden Ring: Tarnished Edition. Here, the company noted both of these games are "slated for a 2026 release for Nintendo Switch 2". I <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fromsoftware-reportedly-in-advanced-development-on-an-unannounced-project-alongside-the-duskbloods">wonder what else From is working on...</a>?</p>
<p>Anyway, <em>hopefully </em>it won't be too much longer before we get either another look at The Duskbloods, or a release date for one or both games. When it does arrive on Nintendo's console, Elden Ring: Tarnished Edition will include <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-tarnished-edition-to-include-two-new-classes">two new classes for players to choose from when they set off for the Lands Between</a>.</p>

<p>Not played Elden Ring yet, and thinking about picking it up on Switch 2? "Grandiose, mysterious, but now a touch more welcoming, Elden Ring tweaks the FromSoft formula to open up its world," reads <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-review">Eurogamer's original Elden Ring review from 2022</a>.</p>

            <p>If you've been keenly watching the Winter Olympics, and wish you could live with some of that chilling sportiness yourself, you may be in luck. A new browser game, called LUGE 2026, is out now for your pleasure.</p>
<p><a href="https://stecurran.com/LUGE2026/">LUGE 2026</a>, created by Ste Curran, grants three daily attempts to race down a 2D track as fast as possible, all while hitting as many boosts as possible and avoiding big wipeouts. You can then compare your time to a global leaderboard of likeminded Luge enthusiasts.</p>
<p>You can even input ghost codes to see other player's runs during your attempt, if you're trying to improve your time or take a more direct challenge to your friend's own attempts.</p>
<p>If the name Ste Curran sounds familiar to you, then it probably is. Ste has written for Eurogamer, used to write for Edge magazine, and hosts the One Life Left podcast.</p>
<p>This may be the best bet for some Olympics-themed gaming right now. This, thanks to the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/olympics-ditched-mario-sonic-series-to-explore-nfts-and-esports">IOC ditching bigger budget Olympics games like the Sonic &amp; Mario Olympics series in favour of esports and NFTs</a>.</p>
<p>If you do try it out, do let us know your best times below! Race on, Winter Olympics lovers. Try not to let your boss see you play it at work…</p>

            <p>
Limited Run Games has started the countdown clock on its Jurassic Park Classic Games Collection - the retro bundle will be pulled from digital stores on 31st March this year, around two and a half years after its arrival.
</p>
<p>
Released back in November 2023, the £25 Jurassic Park Classic Games Collection includes seven movie-inspired titles from the 8-bit and 16-bit era: Jurassic Park (8-bit), Jurassic Park (portable), Jurassic Park (16-bit), Jurassic Park (Genesis), Jurassic Park Part 2: The Chaos Continues (16-bit), Jurassic Park Part 2: The Chaos Continues (portable), and Jurassic Park: Rampage Edition (Genesis). As collections go, it's probably one to pick up for nostalgia value rather than for the quality of the games, but Limited Run does at least include the likes of save state support for a more player-friendly return.

<p>
But the company has now warned Jurassic Park fans and prospective purchasers of the collection's imminent delisting. "We wanted to give you an early heads-up that the Jurassic Park Classic Games Collection will no longer be available for purchase on digital storefronts after March 31, 2026," it <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2673080/view/491590284956666227">wrote in a message shared on Steam</a>. "In the past, we learned how important it is to provide plenty of notice for changes like this, so we're committed to being as open and transparent as possible."
</p><p>
Limited Run doesn't provide a reason for the Jurassic Park Classic Games Collection's removal from storefronts - it's currently available via the <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/games/store/jurassic-park-classic-games-collection/9nwpk5kch6kf">Xbox Store</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-gb/product/EP6890-PPSA17218_00-0134285905209436">PlayStation Store</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Games/Nintendo-Switch-games/Jurassic-Park-Classic-Games-Collection-2482507.html">Switch eShop</a>, <a href="https://www.gog.com/dreamlist/game/jurassic-park-classic-games-collection-2023">GOG</a>, and Steam - but it follows the delisting of other titles in its catalogue, including Bill &amp; Ted's Excellent Retro Collection, due to the expiration of its licensing deals.
</p>
<p>
Any physical copies of Limited Run's Jurassic Park Classic Games Collection left in circulation will obviously still be acquirable by particularly eager fans, but where the digital version is concerned, the clock is now ticking.

            <p>Mewgenics, the 'XCOM with cats' game from the creators of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-binding-of-isaac">The Binding of Isaac</a> and The End is Nigh, will be getting DLC down the line, but it doesn't sound like it will be any time soon.</p>
<p>Mewgenics released earlier this month, and soon became quite popular. In fact, it sold 150k copies in six hours, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mewgenics-is-a-breakout-hit-on-steam-it-sold-150000-copies-in-six-hours-and-its-already-made-its-development-costs">swiftly making back its development costs</a>. That figure has since increased, with developer Tyler Glaiel revealing Mewgenics had sold half a million units in 36 hours (<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/tylerglaiel.com/post/3men362utkk2f">in the words of Glaiel</a>, "wtf").</p>
<p>So, yes, the game is a hit, and many fans already want more. But, they will have to be patient, as according to Glaiel's fellow creator Edmund McMillen, the duo will start work on DLC "in a few months", and only after seeing exactly what it is fans actually like about the game.</p>
<p>"We have a rough idea of something small, like a few more classes and more areas etc but dont wanna start on it till we fully understand what people really like about the game," McMillen wrote on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SteamDeck/comments/1qzfwae/comment/o4b1j1n/">reddit</a>. "I assume it will take a year from when we start to release a DLC.. Maybe?"</p><p>Elsewhere on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SteamDeck/comments/1qzfwae/comment/o4aw40y/">reddit</a>, the duo was asked about the secrets they had tucked away into Mewgenics. To this, Glaiel said there are "a lot of little things" he reckons people will be still discovering for "months or years" to come. He then added this little titbit:</p>
<p>"But we will reserve the true ARG [Alternate Reality Game] level stuff for DLC."</p>

<p>Christian Donlan has already been hands-on with Mewgenics, and all in all was quite taken with it.</p>
<p>"If I have one point to leave you with - other than the fact that the soundtrack is rich with brilliant original songs - it's this: the core of Mewgenics may be simple and familiar, but the game that unfolds across all these runs is huge, and obviously so, even from my position about nine or ten hours in," he wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mewgenics-is-an-infernal-machine-that-runs-on-cats">Eurogamer's Mewgenics Now Playing feature</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
      <p><em>The Long Dark</em> developer Hinterland Studio announced layoffs affecting 14 people on Wednesday, which CEO Raphael van Lierop <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/raphlife.bsky.social/post/3memwiywmpc2e?ref=aftermath.site"><u>called</u></a> the “first group layoffs in 13 years of running the studio.” Van Lierop cited the state of the games industry, as well as the need to push back the release of its upcoming sequel to <em>The Long Dark</em>, <em>Blackfrost</em>.&nbsp;</p><p>“I’m sad to share the news that I’ve made the difficult decision today to part ways with 10 of our cherished colleagues. We will also not extend some existing fixed-term contracts when they expire, impacting another 4 team members, bringing the total affected to 14,” van Lierop wrote in a <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/hinterland.bsky.social/post/3memwfw6erk2e?ref=aftermath.site"><u>statement</u></a>, continuing,</p><blockquote>Like most self-published developers, Hinterland is not insulated from the tumultuous state of the games industry at this time. But this decision is primarily motivated by progress around our projects. <em>Blackfrost</em>, our sequel to <em>The Long Dark</em>, needs more time in development before we will be able to launch it in Early Access. Pushing the game out beyond the end of 2026 means pushing significant expected revenue out as well, and these layoffs will help us preserve the financial resources required to get the game to launch, as well as to continue supporting our current games.</blockquote><figure><blockquote data-bluesky-uri="at://did:plc:5n6ngpyyl65ahx6w7vmh2yvp/app.bsky.feed.post/3memwfw6erk2e" data-bluesky-cid="bafyreiclh4egtnmd7acmd7qzf7qsdgjbj7j7i5jademjb7yz3kzfjy4uj4"><p lang="en">Some heavy news today. We are sadly parting with 10 members of our development team. Details in the statement from our CEO and creative director, below.</p>— <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:5n6ngpyyl65ahx6w7vmh2yvp?ref_src=embed&amp;ref=aftermath.site">Hinterland | WISHLIST BLACKFROST! (@hinterland.bsky.social)</a> <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:5n6ngpyyl65ahx6w7vmh2yvp/post/3memwfw6erk2e?ref_src=embed&amp;ref=aftermath.site">2026-02-12T02:17:39.370Z</a></blockquote></figure><p>This news sucks. But in a week that’s seen <a href="https://aftermath.site/highguard-studio-developers-laid-off/"><u>inexplicable layoffs</u></a> at <em>Highguard</em> developer Wildlight, in which a reported “most” of the team has been let go two weeks after the game’s release, as well as <a href="https://aftermath.site/2xko-riot-release-console-layoffs/"><u>the layoffs of 80 people from Riot’s <em>2XKO</em></u></a><em> </em>a handful of weeks into its official launch because “overall momentum hasn’t reached the level needed to support a team of this size long term,” seeing the thinking behind Hinterland’s layoffs laid out like this is at least comprehensible. The studio was counting on some money coming in at a certain time, and now that money isn’t coming in.</p><p>“As the head of the company, you should cast your judgement on me, and not on” the laid-off developers, van Lierop wrote in the statement. “I’m sorry to have had to let these people go.”</p><p>Contrast <em>that</em> to, say, the behavior of Washington Post (ex)CEO Will Lewis, who announced he was <a href="https://defector.com/shitty-washington-post-publisher-loses-job-after-skipping-out-to-the-super-bowl?ref=aftermath.site"><u>leaving The Post</u></a> last Saturday night after hiding from <a href="https://aftermath.site/washington-post-layoffs-bezos/"><u>mass layoffs</u></a> at his company and then being spotted at a Super Bowl party. (The Washington Post is the former employer of Nathan and me.) CEOs rarely take responsibility for the <a href="https://aftermath.site/embracer-layoffs-executive-saudi/"><u>consequences</u></a> of their choices, reserving that for the employees they lay off and defaulting to ambiguous language or "we" instead of "I" when it comes to who makes the decisions. None of this offsets casting developers into the current <a href="https://aftermath.site/video-game-recruitment-job-applications-ai-layoffs/"><u>games employment market</u></a>, but in a grim sign of the times, I can at least respect a statement that makes sense and puts the responsibility where it belongs. </p><p>In an email to Aftermath, van Lierop said, “I know it's easy to lose sight of the human factor when it comes to leadership, and I know there are some sociopathic studio heads out there who aren't phased by these kinds of things, but the people I know who run studios are strongly humanistic people who care a lot about their teams, and take their leadership responsibilities seriously… It should never be easy to make these kinds of decisions. If it ever becomes easy for me to make a decision about someone's livelihood or their family's safety and security, I should not be in this role anymore.”</p><p>Van Lierop told Aftermath, </p><blockquote>The industry is in shambles. You know you're putting people out into the absolute worst job market for games in the past 25 years. It's going to affect them, their families, in ways you can't imagine. You're tearing apart working relationships and friendships, and the people left behind also have to be able to live with it. There's an inherent sense that you are telling these people they are somehow ‘lesser’ because they've been selected for cuts. When in fact, all you're trying to do is work through this horrific calculus to determine what's the exact combination of layoffs that will do the absolute least amount of damage possible--to the people, to the projects.</blockquote><p>Van Lierop told Aftermath Hinterland will reach out to other studios to try to place laid-off developers, and that “one local Vancouver studio that we hired people from after they did layoffs a few years ago is now hiring again and already reached out to see our list” of affected workers. He said Hinterland will also help laid-off workers with resumes, cover letters, interview practice, and “ensure any artists can use <a href="https://aftermath.site/most-video-game-artwork-will-never-be-seen/"><u>project materials</u></a> for their portfolios.” He said that “Beyond that, we're giving the best severance we can offer, extending benefits as long as we can to help with the transition, and our team will continue to check in on these people and be there if they need emotional support as they look for work.”&nbsp;</p><p>“Every single one of these Hinterlanders is a great person and an excellent developer,” reads the statement. “We are a weaker studio for losing them, and they will be sorely missed.”</p>

            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2026/02/12/monster-hunter-stories-3-twisted-reflection-preview-ecology-and-environmentalism-thrive-in-capcoms-latest/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>No game world has quite the same effect on me as Capcom’s Monster Hunter. Sure, it’s a fairly dangerous sort of place, with ecosystems that are forever going wrong, expeditions that never return, and the sort of native fauna that may or may not choose to use you as a snack, but hey, we’re not hitting a home run in the real world either. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/monser-hunter-stories-3-twisted-reflection">Monster Hunter Stories 3: Twisted Reflection</a> is the latest journey to this world, and the third in the turn-based RPG Monster Hunter Stories spin-off, and it’s doing what all good sequels do: going bigger.</p>
<p><iframe title="Monster Hunter Stories 3: Twisted Reflection - Free Trial Version Trailer!" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mAXVk3HIc44?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Monster Hunter Stories 3 bears plenty of the hallmarks of its predecessors, from the turn-based combat through to the Monsties you and your companions ride on, but it’s offering a more mature story, a wider cast of monsters, and a bigger world for you to sink your teeth into.</p>


<p>One thing that’s clear from the start is that Stories 3 immediately puputstting up more of a fight than the previous Stories games. Whether you’re roaming the open zone areas, or hunting for monster eggs in monster nests, previous titles were pretty easy going in terms of combat, but Capcom have leaned into the more mature tone with a level of challenge that matches it.</p>
<p>If you hang out in monster nests for too long, a higher-powered variant turns up, and if you choose to fight it, you’re really going to have to grind out the win. I found myself against a particularly tough Gypceros after only thirty minutes or so with the game, while I was still grappling to remember just how Stories 3 combat worked. It nearly had me – death does, at least, only send you back to the closest settlement – but my team were victorious, and that brought the sense of elation that Monster Hunter should give you (and which Wilds somewhat fumbled at launch).</p>


<p>There’s a lot going on in Stories 3 combat. It’s built upon a returning structure, with the basis being a rock-paper-scissors-like system with Power, Speed and Technique attacks, with each being more powerful than one of the others. You’re rewarded for learning monsters’ attack types, and just like in the mainline series, these are changed up by the monster becoming enraged or, in some cases, infected, turning them into Feral variants that you have to approach in a completely different way.</p>
<p>That sense of challenge and a more mature outlook run through the opening hours of Stories 3. You’re a prince of the Azuria kingdom, and, in turn, the Captain of the Rangers, a group of monster riders who study the local ecosystem and hope to raise and protect monsters rather than hunt them.</p>
<p>The opening of the game sees you exploring the area, where you’re introduced to the appearance of egg quartz, a crystalline substance that traps monsters within it. In fact, monsters are in decline, and certain species are affected more than others, and that backdrop becomes crucial to your role within Monster Hunter Stories 3.</p>
<p>Collecting monsters – or Monsties, as they have it here – has always been a key part of the series, building a Pokemon-like party of six to enable you to jump, fly, swim and perform various other environmental actions, while also trying to create a well-balanced team that can face off against any potential foe. However, in Stories 3, you’re also tasked with revitalising the local ecology, hatching and releasing monsters back into the wild to restore the habitat and bring the world back into balance.</p>

<p>Endangered species are found in the vicinity of invasive species – particularly nasty, and downright brutal monster variants that you need to scare off – and then you can hatch and release them into areas that will benefit from their appearance. As you increase the population, the area will then produce rarer or stronger eggs for you to hatch, making it feel as though you really are at work improving and working with the environment.</p>
<p>It’s a natural direction for the Stories series to lean into. The monster-riding action has always sat at odds with the mainline series’ traditional hunting and slaying, and living and working alongside monsters fits really well into the Rangers’ outlook and organisation. I can see it becoming a real timesink for players, and one that can result in some seriously cool and unusual monster variants.</p>

<p>They do, of course, all look absolutely amazing. Stories 3 art style is a gorgeous, anime-infused cavalcade of colour, building on <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/07/07/monster-hunter-stories-2-switch-review-pc-wings-of-ruin/">Stories 2’s</a> excellent visuals, and then ramping everything up. Playing on <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Switch 2</a>, the advantages of its extra power are clear to see, with much improved draw distances in the open field areas, and a more reliable level of performance, albeit one that occasionally needs to catch up with itself in more heavily populated, detailed areas.</p>
<p>Battles especially look truly stunning, and the added depth and challenge are made all the more enjoyable by the excellent animations and visual effects that accompany every move. The only mild negative is that they can be quite time-consuming, so once you’ve watched your Rathalos descend from the sky a bunch of times, you can speed combat up and whiz through less important encounters in seconds.</p>
<p>I have loved my early time with Monster Hunter Stories 3: Twisted Reflection. So far, it’s the most complete and grown-up, the Stories side of things has ever been, and it truly feels like the other side of the Monster Hunter coin – equally matched, and inextricably linked, despite all their differences.</p>

<figure data-uuid="453b8fd48c35f"><a title="Go Go Power Rangers" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/453b8fd48c35f/go-go-power-rangers.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Capcom</em></figcaption></figure><p>Nintendo’s relationship with the <strong><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/best-monster-hunter-games-ranked-switch-and-nintendo-systems">Monster Hunter</a></strong> series is an intriguing one – in one sense it’s at the heart of the IP with timed exclusives, but it’s also missed out on two blockbuster mainline entries in <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps4/monster_hunter_world">World</a> and <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/monster_hunter_wilds">Wilds</a>; perhaps Switch 2 will remedy that shortcoming. The spin-off <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/browse?title=series%3Amonster-hunter-stories"><strong>Stories</strong> series</a>, however, started out as a late-gen 3DS game and the series has kept on coming to Nintendo hardware ever since.</p>
<p>The first two games offer a good time for those new to the IP, or fans that want an adventure a little less intense and challenging. They were largely (though not exclusively) cutesy in style, and while that’s still partially true with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/monster-hunter-stories-3-twisted-reflection">Monster Hunter Stories 3: Twisted Reflection</a>, this does feel like an entry that’s following its audience. If you were young when you played the original, this may now fit well into your older sensibilities. It’s still charming and easygoing at times, but the tone has shifted a little.</p>
<p>In terms of narrative, Twisted Reflection, like the two games before it, goes off on its own; you don’t need to be familiar with its predecessors to dive in here. The storytelling at times feels a little like modern <strong>Fire Emblem</strong> – gorgeous cutscenes in the preview section (the first 6-8 hours of the game) tell the tale of tensions between two nations, a world of endangered monster species and ecological collapse. There are some heavy themes, but they’re told with dashes of hope, and your role as a Prince and Ranger sees you working to improve the world in multiple ways.</p><figure data-uuid="829cfd76af4d8"><a title="It's a draw" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/829cfd76af4d8/its-a-draw.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Capcom</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Right from the start, the storytelling, <em>gorgeous</em> orchestral music and cast of characters will draw you in. As a Monster Hunter RPG, it has a slow-ish opening hour, but after that I felt in a similar flow as I have in big-name genre IPs from the likes of Square Enix, Atlus, and Monolith Soft; Capcom’s team has evidently continued to mature in its approach to making an RPG that devours hours in each play session.</p>
<p>What’s also encouraging is that it’s done this while retaining the Stories style, at least in the early going. As in previous entries, you gradually build up a team of ‘Monsties’, cute takes on iconic franchise beasts that you can ride and team up with in battle, along with a companion and their Monstie.</p>
<p>Battles themselves retain the rock-paper-scissors approach, though with impressive depth. Initially, I have stuck to the same three weapon types, each of which can target specific monster parts with each move, but there are various others I haven’t yet touched.</p>
<p>Even in the early running, there looks to be a dizzying amount of detail for those that seek it, and it’ll be interesting to see if — like its predecessors — this is at least partially optional. Ways to customise and evolve Monsties return, gathering eggs to rear creatures to then release and revive regional ecologies seems prevalent, and already stores and armourers are offering <em>a lot</em> of tools to eventually get you through a presumably tough end-game. I’ll be intrigued to see how deep these mechanics go, how <em>necessary</em> they are to surviving towards the end, and just how fabulous our fashion can get as we encounter more monster types in the world.</p><figure data-uuid="0dbdb013d6717"><a title="It's a big world" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/0dbdb013d6717/its-a-big-world.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Capcom</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>In the opening sections it also seems that, beyond mechanical depth, this game is setting up for a decent amount of pure content. The story itself has — so far — introduced some key threads and then reached a dramatic denouement to set the scene for ‘Chapter 2’, but I’ve also enjoyed diving into side quests and side stories. The former are mostly basic ‘collect these things’ or ‘defeat this monster’, but the latter take you into little standalone vignettes with each companion in which you learn a little more about them. Even early on with only ‘Chapter 1’ for each side story available so far, there’s been a fair bit of gameplay variety and oodles of charm.</p>
<p>So far, so good. That said, I do have a mix of praise and minor issues around performance in this current version 1.0 build. As mentioned before, cutscenes — including those delivered in-engine — look and sound fantastic; I would also like to give a nod to the voice acting so far. While praise is generally given to RE Engine, this title is still clearly working on the foundations from the previous games; often it looks gorgeous, but sometimes it goes the other way.</p>
<p>Frame rate is <em>okay</em>, too. It's generally reasonable but appears to be unlocked and can veer from around 30fps at most times to occasional 60fps flashes in cutscenes (like combat special moves) or enclosed areas like caves. Docked play is better than handheld at present, as the image is certainly a good deal softer in the portable configuration. There are also regular blemishes, such as textures loading in late after scene cuts, which are hard to ignore. At times, it’s a <em>little</em> scruffy.</p><figure data-uuid="77ad05838d854"><a title="Slightly over the top move" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/77ad05838d854/slightly-over-the-top-move.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Capcom</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Aggressive motion blur and frame rate inconsistencies in crowded areas, as well as some dives in resolution on handheld especially, seem like areas that can hopefully be tidied up in the final weeks before launch.</p>
<p>I should also highlight that, overall, the game does look pretty good, but just because it is miles above the fidelity of a <em>certain</em> <em>bestselling monster-catching IP</em> doesn't negate it falling below other impressive RPGs early on in the Switch 2 lifecycle. However, this 1.0 build isn’t bad by any stretch, and at times the game has a bit of a wow factor. With a little refinement, it could certainly stand out further.</p>
<p>All told, our opening dalliances with Monster Hunter Stories 3: Twisted Reflection are full of positives. Time will tell in the many hours to come whether this ultimately sets a new bar for this rather quirky but worthwhile spin-off series.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>BlazBlue Entropy Effect X</em> is an odd release this year. It is an updated version of a roguelike spin-off of Arc System Works' <em>BlazBlue</em> fighting game series. A series that's been mostly dead since 2016. This new update does add some new elements tying the game to the greater series, but these additions are minor, doing little to distract from the core game's lack of identity.</p><h2>Navigating The Possibilities</h2><p>The setup of <em>BlazBlue Entropy Effect X</em> is relatively unchanged from the original PC and mobile release. You are a dowhoctor that is part of a think tank, performing experiments on a phenomenon known as the Sea of Possibility, a vast ocean of data displaying infinite branching timelines, alternate histories, and collapsed realities.</p><figure role="group">

<figcaption>It's all very simple, first we have to talk about parallel universes....</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>These experiments involve exploring this huge landscape and searching for Shards of Possibility. These Shards may hold secrets to the think tank's ultimate goal of stopping the end of the world.</p><p>The connection is that the Shards of Possibility contain fragments of events from the <em>BlazBlue</em> series, and the avatars you use to explore are <em>BlazBlue</em> characters. In essence, the cast in this game are trying to make sense of arguably the most convoluted lore ever conceived for a fighting game franchise and to make sense of it.</p><p>I don't make that above statement likely. I played the <em>BlazBlue</em> games as they were coming out and tried to analyze them back when I had more free time than good sense. Even in comparison to another ArcSys franchise, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/guilty-gear-strive-review" rel="nofollow"><em>Guilty Gear</em></a>, &nbsp;this series is way too complex for its own good. Centuries of war, reality-warping machine gods, a ton of overlapping time travel plots, time loops, branching timelines happening all at once, time ghosts, apocalyptic doomsday events, mad science, the list goes on.</p><figure role="group">

  </picture>
<figcaption>Oh hey, it's that moment from that game from like twenty years ago.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>There is a reason even dedicated <em>BlazBlue</em> fans can't understand half of what happens. Which, in a way, makes the cast of <em>BlazBlue Entropy Effect X</em> a sort of stand-in for its target audience.</p><p>Unfortunately, this framework leads to some pacing and narrative issues overall. The supporting cast of scientists are barely above stock anime stereotypes. The “revelations” offered by the Shards of Possibility are chosen at random and add little to the main plot. A few lightly touch on major elements like The Black Beast, the Cauldron, and the Boundary, but others will just reiterate various plot points like Ragna's death loop, or Iron Tager and Kokonoe's relationship. The plot states that these Shards will reveal some hidden secret, but the events amount to a scattered blast of references.</p><p>Because of this, the story of <em>BlazBlue Entropy Effect X</em> lacked any forward momentum or personal drive. I wasn't playing to get the next piece of the mystery; I was playing to see the next nostalgic callback and for someone else to deliver exposition. By the time the credits rolled, I was mostly checked out among a sea of technobabble.</p><figure role="group">

<figcaption>Yes, that's the Prisoner from Dead Cells. Yes, he's fighting ninjas.</figcaption>
</figure>
<h2>The Wheel of Fate is Turning</h2><p>Despite my gripes with the plot of <em>BlazBlue Entropy Effect X</em>, the core gameplay shines. &nbsp;Each run has you play through a series of levels and boss fights as a <em>BlazBlue</em> character. Keep going until you die or until you reach the final boss and win.</p><p>On paper, the shift from a 2D fighting game to a hack-and-slash platformer may seem horrendous, especially given <em>BlazBlue's</em> very technical, deliberate approach to fighting game mechanics. But it's a change that works relatively well. Character attacks are reduced to simple combo strings and one special attack tied to a mana bar. But as you progress from room to room, one of the items you can pick up, called Potential, slowly opens up that character's suite of moves and modifies their skills. This includes extra special attacks, multiple jumps, alternate attacks, and even more technical bonuses like jump cancels.</p><p>It's a change many <em>BlazBlue</em> fans may scoff at. Boiling down characters' movesets into something as complex as <em>Super Smash Bros</em> can be a step too far. But as someone who has put a lot of time into <em>Dead Cells</em>, this gameplay transition works great.</p><figure role="group">

<figcaption>Joke's on you, I live for this input reading nonsense!</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Thankfully, this simplification doesn't change any of the characters' gameplay quirks. Ragna the Bloodedge is still a risk-reward character with his special attacks sapping his HP, but restores it upon getting a kill. Hakumen is slower, but has devastating block and parry effects. Noel still has her balletic aerial gun kata combos. Taokaka can still air juggle like a boss with her directional air dashes.</p><p>Sadly, these more technical details are the most interesting part of <em>BlazBlue Entropy Effect X's</em> core gameplay. Rewards you get from room to room are a suite of elemental effects, buffs, and risky trade-offs. Nothing spectacular if you're familiar with the genre, but do help add spice to each subsequent run.</p><figure role="group">

</figure>
<p>Which is good because the enemy variety is lacking. Ninjas, samurai, bugs, mad science experiments. Outside of a few challenge rooms, you'll get tired of fighting these minions pretty quickly.</p><p>The boss fights are only marginally better. The game even has two different boss rush challenge arenas that put these fights front and center. But they also suffer from derivative visual designs and predictable behaviors.</p><figure role="group">

<figcaption>Yeah, I do not want to lose i-Frames for any reason at all.</figcaption>
</figure>
<h2>Crumbling Entropy</h2><p><em>BlazBlue Entropy Effect X's</em> meta progression does mitigate some of these issues. It features an Entropy and Extreme difficulty toggle, similar to the Heat system from the Hades games. You can adjust different elements of the game, like enemy numbers, aggression levels, or even putting time limits on finishing each fight.&nbsp;</p><p>When enough of these modifiers are active, you'll get certain benefits for that run, like extra health or earning extra upgrade points. &nbsp;In addition, completing runs grants you points that you can spend on your Mind Level, which increases your maximum health, and Mind Crystals, which are equippable buffs that can give you an edge. It's a solid system that helps mitigate some of the underbaked parts of the core combat.</p><figure role="group">

<figcaption>Hey Arakune, how does this fire build feel?</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Sadly, the pacing issues I mentioned above grate against this core loop. As you play, you'll be given an objective to complete, which will unlock a Shard of Possibility. Unfortunately, you can only get one Shard per run. This means, depending on your skill level, you can end up doing several runs that are utterly pedestrian just to move the plot along.</p><p>A personal example is that I was completing runs at Extreme difficulty. But I wasn't getting a Shard to progress because I wasn't playing on Entropy difficulty. It is annoying pedantic padding.</p><p>Which brings me to another critique I do have with <em>BlazBlue Entropy Effect X</em>. If you played the original PC/ Mobile release and were looking forward to new material, there isn't much here to justify another purchase. Aside from the new Extreme mode and its new boss fights, there is only one new playable character added to the roster: Naoto Kurogane from <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/blazblue-central-fiction-review-burning-blue-soul" rel="nofollow"><em>BlazBlue Central Fiction</em></a>. He is a welcome addition, but he only highlights the lack of other characters on the roster. No Iron Tager. No Platinum. No Bang Shishigami.</p><picture>

  </picture><h2><em>BlazBlue Entropy Effect X</em> Review | Final Thoughts</h2><p>I didn't hate my time with <em>BlazBlue Entropy Effect X</em>. The visuals are appealing. I enjoyed figuring out different combos and builds with each character. I loved seeing certain characters again in a new genre. I even enjoyed the replayability of the Entropy and Extreme modifiers.</p><p>But when that gameplay is wrapped around a meandering plot awkwardly gesturing at nostalgia and clashes with the core progression, it results in an experience wrapped in a <em>BlazBlue</em> skin rather than a meaningful spin-off.</p><hr><p><em><strong>BlazBlue Entropy Effect X</strong> was reviewed on PlayStation 5 with a code provided by the publisher.
