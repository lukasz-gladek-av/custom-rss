Before we get into our plans, though, let's recap the week.</p>
<p>It was a pretty quiet one in Nintendo Land, with not so much as a whiff of a Direct — which is weird, after the last three weeks of showcases. Nintendo revealed an all-new <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/mario-kart-world-announces-summer-vacation-skill-test-event">event in Japan</a>, announced that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/chibi-robo">Chibi-Robo</a> would soon be <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/nintendo-expands-switch-2s-gamecube-library-next-week">arriving on the GameCube NSO library</a> and just <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/could-this-mysterious-super-mario-40th-anniversary-x-account-be-legit">maybe set up the social media account</a> for Mario's upcoming 40th anniversary. Oh yes, and we went <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/previews/first-impressions-pokemon-legends-z-a-is-an-attempt-to-catch-the-hardcore-again">hands-on</a> with a little-known curio called <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pokemon_legends_z-a">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a>.</p>
<p>We also found time to review <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/heretic_plus_hexen">Heretic + Hexen</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/teenage_mutant_ninja_turtles_tactical_takedown">Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Tactical Takedown</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/drag-x-drive">Drag x Drive</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/ufo_50">UFO 50</a> and more.</p>
<p>Now then, what's everyone up to?</p>

<h2>Ollie Reynolds, Staff Writer</h2>
<p>I’m knee-deep in yet another fighting game binge, so this weekend will be a mix of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/street-fighter-6-years-1-2-fighters-edition">Street Fighter 6</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/dragon_ball_fighterz">Dragon Ball FighterZ</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/marvel_vs_capcom_fighting_collection_arcade_classics">Marvel Vs Capcom Fighting Collection: Arcade Classics</a>. I’ve still yet to purchase the latest character pass for Street Fighter 6, but the temptation to play as Sagat is slowly but surely starting to overwhelm. Maybe I’ll cave by Monday, we’ll see. Have a good one, folks!</p>
<h2>Jim Norman, Staff Writer</h2>
<p>I polished off the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mina-the-hollower">Mina</a> demo in one tasty sitting, and have been noodling about with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gbc/legend_of_zelda_oracle_of_seasons">Oracle of Seasons</a> ever since — it's funny how all that GBC inspiration can get you in the mood for... more GBC, isn't it? I also seem to have blinked and somehow racked up a backlog of 2025 games that I'd like to see to before the year is out. Chilling with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/tiny_bookshop">Tiny Bookshop</a> and swooning with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/date_everything">Date Everything!</a> it is, then.</p>

<h2>Alana Hagues, Deputy Editor</h2>
<p>I'm like Jim has been the past two weeks — in between multiple things but never quite settling on one. UFO 50 is only adding to the problem with its huge 50 game library. And <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/pipistrello_and_the_cursed_yoyo">Pipistrello</a> is amazing, so I'm glad I can dip in and out of that as I please. It'll keep you top-down fans more than occupied until Mina the Hollower arrives.</p>
<p>September and October are <em>stuffed</em> though, so maybe it's a good thing I don't feel like playing much right now. Have a good one!</p>
<h2>Kate Gray, Contributor</h2>
<p>I've been playing a fair bit of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/ritual_of_raven">Ritual of Raven</a>, a farming-meets-programming game that just came out. It's very interesting! I'll admit that the learning curve is steep, but since I'm learning programming anyway (in Love2D, with Lua) it's basically homework.</p>
<p>I also FINALLYYYYYY completed <strong>PEAK</strong> this week. Got to the top of the mountain after dying 4 times on the way up. Now I just have to do it again, right? Easy...</p>

<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/sonic_mania">Sonic Mania</a> is one of the best Sonic games ever, and while there were hopes it would get a sequel, a few years ago, it was revealed how <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2023/07/sonic-mania-2-didnt-happen-because-sega-wanted-to-move-beyond-pixel-art">Sega was eager to move beyond pixel art</a> and ultimately it didn't go ahead.</p>
<p>At the time, Sega worked with Headcannon and Christian Whitehead "to consider concepts for the next generation of Classic Sonic", and now, after all this time, Whitehead <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/cfwhitehead.bsky.social/post/3lwhbnncp6s2y">has shared concept artwork</a> of what could have been, including a look at the Kanga Clanga Badnik "as it appears in the 2.5D prototype".</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"It is now the 8th anniversary of Mania so time to dig up some Sonic trivia... This year, it's Kanga Clanga! (aka the Kangus). This lovable robo-roo originally lived in the outback but now entertains us all in Pinball Carnival Zone!"</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/asus-teases-%E2%80%98extraordinary%E2%80%99-xbox-controller-reveal.1271664/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Asus recently joined forces with Xbox to produce the ROG Xbox Ally, an upgraded gaming handheld device with stacks of processing power, battery life, and a clean Xbox-themed UI. That’s not all that the tech titan has up its sleeves when it comes to collaborations, as a new Xbox controller fused with Asus <strong>in some way </strong>was just teased.</p>



<p>In a new trailer uploaded recently, Asus suggested that ‘something extraordinary is coming’, showing a snippet of an instantly recognizable Xbox controller with an Asus ROG touch.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-the-asus-xbox-controller">What is the Asus Xbox Controller?</h2>



<p>While we know <strong>plenty </strong>about the ROG Xbox Ally and ROG Xbox Ally X, the controller is a new concept to everyone.</p>



<p>In a 13-second clip uploaded to YouTube, the ROG team promoted a teaser for a grand reveal set to take place at Gamescom in just a few days:</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Get ready to experience the future of gaming at #ROGGamescom2025. Stay tuned. 🎮⚡" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WyRyHC0t6zc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>







<p>It’s impossible to glean much from the video, but we can see it’s an evolution over the standard Xbox controller, with a couple of extra buttons sitting around the grips. The Xbox button is smaller than on typical controllers, and a ROG RGB logo sits front and centre.</p>



<p>The share and start buttons also look new and are flanked by two <strong>extra </strong>face buttons.</p>



<p>Based on recent upgrades made to controllers in the gaming space, I’d predict that whatever this is, it has ‘Hall Effect’ thumbsticks, short-actuation triggers and shoulder buttons, perhaps fused with switchable stops, and high-polling, low-latency mechanics.</p>



<p>If nothing else, it’ll be an upgrade over <a href="https://rog.asus.com/uk/controllers/rog-raikiri-pro-model/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the ROG Raikiri Pro</a>, an Xbox controller with a built-in OLED display, tri-mode connectivity, and customization options via Asus’ Armoury Crate software.</p>



<p>What do you hope the reveal is? Let me know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

<p>The Battlefield 6 beta is back and taking the world by storm (again). Despite a few niggling changes that have left some players a little dismayed, the ongoing playtest is indicative of the hype surrounding this title, which is set to be released in full on October 10.</p>



<p>As the beta unravels, we’re seeing some trends emerge, and none of them is more wholesome than the selfless mission to become the best medic in Battlefield 6. Folks are going entire games without dealing a shred of damage, emulating <em>Hacksaw Ridge </em>and giving up their game to save as many players as possible.</p>



<p>I recently stumbled across a contender for the title of Best Battlefield 6 Medic.</p>



<h2 id="h-playing-the-medic-in-battlefield-like-never-before">Playing The Medic in Battlefield Like Never Before</h2>



<p>Battlefield 6 is nothing without classes, and for the most part, players are doing what the classes are made for. The Support folks are dropping ammo bags galore, the Engineer troops are taking out tanks, Assault soldiers are leading the fight from the frontline, and Recon fighters are sitting back in the hills and windows of crumbling buildings.</p>



<p>In my opinion, it’s the Support players who are living their role, leaning on the dual function of restocking ammo and providing revives to keep the battlefield flowing.</p>



<p>I was recently sent an image from a friend who is living out the role of conscientious objector in Battlefield 6.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>While playing a game of Breakthrough on Liberation Peak, this user lived and breathed the Support class, refusing to kill a single enemy (and only dying four times!) as the match unravelled.</p>



<p>Instead, this player flew around the map with reckless abandon, reviving <strong>564 players </strong>and netting a whopping 56,575 XP while doing so. His buddy fell in second place, securing 395 revives but unfortunately taking the lives of seven enemies.</p>



<p>Phenomenal effort.</p>



<p>Have you secured a score that can rival 564 revives in a single match? Let me know how you’re playing Battlefield 6 on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>PETA has gone after Nintendo over Mario Kart World, requesting that the gaming titan make one change to Cow by removing the character’s brass nose ring. In a letter sent to Shuntaro Furukawa, Nintendo president, PETA stressed that ‘nose rings are forcibly pierced through one of the most sensitive parts of a cow’s body.’</p>



<p>The argument is that Cow’s nose accessory in Mario Kart World is ‘glossing over real-world violence’ and should be removed.</p>



<h2 id="h-why-is-peta-bothering-nintendo">Why is PETA Bothering Nintendo?</h2>



<p>In <a href="https://www.peta.org/news/peta-mario-kart-world-controversy-cow-nose/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a post published hours ago</a> (at the time of writing), PETA explained what the deal was with it chasing down Nintendo over a design decision in Mario Kart World:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We know Mario Kart World is just a game—and that’s exactly why Cow’s nose ring needs to go. Mario Kart is supposed to be a fun escape, not a reminder of the painful tools used on cows in the meat and dairy industries. No one wants to think about animal suffering while zipping around a race track.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The team wrote, ‘No cow in the <em>real world </em>who is forced to wear a nose ring would ever sport Cow’s goofy grin in Nintendo’s game.’</p>



<p>I advise checking out the PETA link above with care—it’s a short jump from the article to some gruesome images, which is a classic shock move for the organization.</p>



<p>This isn’t the first time that PETA has challenged developers or publishers. In January 2024, I secured an exclusive statement from the organization regarding a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/peta-animal-cruelty-in-palworld-statement/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">vegan outcry against Palworld</a>:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>PETA has already heard from many Palworld fans who have no interest in eating ‘Pals’ and want a vegan guide created for the game. It’s ‘Veganuary’ after all, and gamers want to help animals by eating vegan in their game worlds and outside.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>PETA has also petitioned against Hunting Simulator 2 and Animal Crossing: New Horizons. The latter claim was that players are encouraged to be ‘abusive towards fish and insects.’</p>



<p><strong>Seriously</strong>.</p>



<p>Do you think there’s any weight to PETA’s petition against Nintendo? Let me know what you’re thinking on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>In a post on social media, Chris ‘To Catch a Predator’ Hansen has confirmed that he’s working with law enforcement, victims, and activists to investigate Roblox in the wake of the recent child abuse controversies.</p>



<p>In recent months, Roblox has faced scrutiny from the world as constant concerning cases have surfaced, and as the game grows, so too do the allegations and lawsuits.</p>



<h2 id="h-roblox-faces-to-catch-a-predator-treatment">Roblox Faces To Catch a Predator Treatment</h2>



<p>Chris Hansen, who is best known as the face of To Catch a Predator, a documentary-style show that trapped and captured child predators, is taking on Roblox. In a recent post on social media, the television host and investigator revealed:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>You may have heard that my streaming crime network TruBlu and I are investigating the exploitation of children on the popular gaming platform, Roblox.</p>



<p>It’s absolutely true and we’re deep into it. I’ve already interviewed law enforcement investigators and victims of this horrible activity.</p>



<p>We have collaborators, some people who have been working in this space, including Schlep, who have committed to help us in this endeavour.</p>



<p>Will Roblox actually say anything about it? Will it make any changes? We’re going to do our best to hold them accountable.</p>
</blockquote>



<figure></figure>







<p>It was rumored a couple of days back that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/chris-hansen-roblox-plans-documentary-predator-claim/">Hansen was getting involved</a> with the ongoing scandal and backlash against Roblox. This might be the profile boost that the situation needs, with Hansen’s legitimate television network weighing heavily into the claims that the Roblox Corporation isn’t doing enough to protect children.</p>



<p>Roblox is one of the (if not <strong>the</strong>) most popular games in the world right now. It has racked up hundreds of millions of players exploring a diverse ecosystem of games, most of which are created by the users themselves. There’s a dark underbelly to the world of Roblox, and it’s one that parents are becoming increasingly aware of.</p>



<p>Do you think this effort by Chris Hansen will drive change in the Roblox space? Let me know what you’re thinking on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

<p>Playable at the World Championships</p>
</section></header><section>

<p><strong><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pokemon_legends_z-a">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a></strong> isn't out until October, but this weekend there's a Switch 2 demo at the 2025 Pokémon World Championships.</p>
<p>The first impressions are now rolling in, and we've put together some thoughts so far – starting with a 'hands on' from our senior video producer Zion Grassl. Although it might not be for everyone, we're thinking the hardcore fans will be pleased with how it's shaping up.</p>
<h3><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/">Nintendo Life:</a></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>"While I’m still trying to temper my excitement and expectations for the overall city exploration, I’m relieved to report the combat, from what I've played, feels like just the thing the series needs to take it into the next generation."</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/nintendo-switch-2/related-articles:186394 @ 1755341458 -->
<p>So, what did other outlets have to say about the demo? Here's what's been said so far:</p>
<h3><a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/759788/pokemon-legends-z-a-battle-real-time-preview">The Verge:</a></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>"The demo, which I played ahead of the 2025 Pokémon World Championships in Anaheim, California, was split into two parts lasting around 10 minutes each, both seemingly early in the game and heavily focused on the new battle system... It’s a big departure from nearly 30 years of <em>Pokémon</em> games<em>.</em> I’m used to thinking about <em>Pokémon</em> like a chess match, slowly and several steps ahead; in <em>Z-A</em>, I had to think about the same type matchups and stats and everything else, but quickly and on my feet. It took me some time to adjust."</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<h3><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-legends-z-a-battle-system-first-impressions">IGN:</a></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>"I can see the potential, but with just twenty minutes of experiencing the early game, it’s much too soon to tell if this real-time battle system will scratch the strategy-itch Pokémon games usually do for me."</p>
</blockquote>
<h3><a href="https://www.polygon.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-preview-active-battle-mechanics/">Polygon:</a></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>"The combat felt fresh, and I was only able to see the beginning of it. I wanted to get right back into another epic battle. I wanted <em>more</em>. And this is all based on a relatively small representation of early-game hours. I can only imagine how much more engaging the combat will feel with a full party of Pokémon, all rocking fleshed-out movesets, as you go up against a formidable foe."</p>
</blockquote>
<h3><a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/features/hands-on-pokemon-legends-z-a-proves-legends-is-still-pokemons-most-exciting-series/">VGC:</a></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>" Arceus was a game that brought back so many fans, specifically because it departed from the main series formula, and Z-A is an even bigger departure. It will take much more time with the new battle system to get to grips with the new way of taking down Trainers, but we’re thoroughly sold on Rogue Mega Pokémon battles already."</p>
</blockquote>
<h3><a href="https://www.serebii.net/pokemon/">Serebii.net</a></h3>
<p>And to round things off, here's what Serebii.net webmaster Joe Merrick had to say about this demo (<a href="https://youtu.be/8bjZLO8cKyw">via Serebii on YouTube</a>):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"It's still early, and it's hard to say how well the new systems will work in an overall game, but from what I played here, it seems like it's a cool evolution of the Pokémon Legends formula and it has me wanting to go back and play more, which is a good sign in my view."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This demo is available to the general public at the World Championships this weekend, but you'll need to have registered your interest on Nintendo's website with a Nintendo Account, and it's "first come, first served". You can find out more in our post about this demo:</p>

                <p>The <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-open-beta-release-date-time/1100-6533515/" data-ref-id="1100-6533515">Battlefield 6 open beta</a> is currently in its second weekend, and players are still adsorbing the latest entry to the franchise. Meanwhile, Digital Foundry has shared its technical breakdown from the first weekend of Battlefield 6's open beta, and the early verdict is very good.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oDVDQbgL3Rs" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/oDVDQbgL3Rs" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>That's not to say that the open beta was flawless. In the opening minutes alone, DF broke down some of the issues with the destructible environments. There are occasional glitches, including pieces of rubble floating in air without being connected to the structure around them. Battlefield 6's buildings appear to fall apart using a state-based system rather than registering unique damage or breaking points. Yet it's still an improvement over Battlefield 2049 and Battlefield 5.</p><p>Visually, DF saw the best results when running the SSGI option on PC, which allowed for more natural lighting, and suggested that this feature should be included for PlayStation 5 Pro. Unsurprisingly, the PS5 Pro performed better than the standard PS5, but the gap wasn't as great as it was between the Xbox Series X and the Xbox Series S. In a side-by-side comparison, the S noticeably struggled to keep up with the on-screen details that the X handled more smoothly.</p><p>Even in the beta's current state, DF said that Battlefield 6 "is very shippable at the moment" and added that it has "a level of mechanical polish that feels top-notch." However, DF added that the game could really use some raytracing embellishments and that it doesn't feel innovative in the way that some of the previous titles have.</p><p>Among players, one of the current complaints is that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-open-beta-reveals-rush-is-limited-to-12v12-and-people-are-upset/1100-6533943/" data-ref-id="1100-6533943">the size of the 12v12 Rush mode</a> is too small, but the final game's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-maps-are-too-small-players-say-but-bigger-ones-are-coming/1100-6533900/" data-ref-id="1100-6533900">bigger maps</a> may solve that issue. Regardless, Battlefield 6's beta has already passed <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-beta-eclipses-call-of-duty-player-record-on-steam/1100-6533822/" data-ref-id="1100-6533822">Call of Duty's concurrent-player record</a>, as well as the record of the previous Battlefield games on Steam. The second Battlefield 6 open beta will conclude on August 17.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Virtua Fighter 5 R.E.V.O | Launch Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">One of Sega's announcements at EVO was the release date for the PS5 and Xbox Series X|S versions of VF5 REVO, now titled VF5 REVO World Stage. The title isn't just a multiplatform rebrand--it will be receiving a host of new updates like cross-platform play, with the crown jewel being a brand-new, dedicated single-player experience akin to the Quest Modes seen in past Virtua Fighter games.</p><p dir="ltr">I've been consistently surprised at the amount of effort Aoki and his team have been putting into updating and revitalizing this classic title, and seeing the new single-player mode was a clear sign that they'd been listening to player feedback for such an addition. But there's still one thing I needed to know: What about all the extra character customization items and decorations from Virtua Fighter 5 Final Showdown that hadn't made their way into REVO?</p><p dir="ltr">"We've heard from players that they want more of the items they saw in the previous releases," Aoki said. "So, in World Stage mode, there is a tournament. As you proceed, you'll be able to earn some of those customization items. I do feel like there needs to be more new items, but for now, there are no plans."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4550567-ss_2e8cd29e74239fe87dded592f9238a337410cb0d.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4550567" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4550567-ss_2e8cd29e74239fe87dded592f9238a337410cb0d.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4550567"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4550567-ss_2e8cd29e74239fe87dded592f9238a337410cb0d.1920x1080.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">An element where the Virtua Fighter teams have been stepping up their game has been community engagement. Besides opening an official Discord and running a global tournament series, the team has also been polling players on subjects like what controllers they use, what type of stages they dislike, and--most prominently--a global character popularity poll, with the results displayed on the official VF website.</p><p dir="ltr">I asked Aoki if the polls offered up any surprises. "We did do the poll around the time the first tournament for VF5 REVO was held in Chicago, at Frosty Faustings. Seeing the players there, I really felt that the characters that are relatively unpopular in Japan tend to be popular in the West. For example, Aoi was pretty popular, Brad was very popular, Eileen was very popular. Those Western characters usually are not on the top of the list in Japan. In Japan, it's more like Akira, Jacky, Pai, [and] Sarah. It was interesting to see, and I think that was reflected in the poll as well."</p><p dir="ltr">With the launch of VF5 REVO came the game's first major balance update in over a decade. Does the team use things like polls, online play data, and other analytics to decide on gameplay tweaks?</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4550569-ss_b8854174b3cc234e5bc8ec49573ee8b5ca1b018e.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4550569" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4550569-ss_b8854174b3cc234e5bc8ec49573ee8b5ca1b018e.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4550569"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4550569-ss_b8854174b3cc234e5bc8ec49573ee8b5ca1b018e.1920x1080.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">"We're not really thinking about things like who to make weaker or stronger, but to put everyone on a similar level," Aoki replied. "How do we balance characters and keep what makes them distinct? Previously, a lot of players said that Taka-Arashi was too strong. But we tried not to make him specifically much weaker, but bring everyone to his level."</p><p dir="ltr">Aoki also says that further tweaking is unlikely in the near future. "There are no plans for changes right now. But as time passes, we might get to a point where we say, 'Oh, maybe we should make some balance changes, when the timing is right.' But at the moment, there are no plans. Currently, I feel like the gameplay is in a complete state, but we'll see how it goes."</p><p dir="ltr">While Virtua Fighter titles have appeared as sub-games in many of the Yakuza/Like a Dragon titles, an official series compilation has never happened. I wondered if Aoki's legacy Virtua Fighter team had ever considered doing a Capcom Fighting Collection-style release of Virtua Fighter and similar Sega fighting games, such as the Fighting Vipers series and Last Bronx. "I've definitely seen those compilations and thought, 'We should do something like that.' …By doing that, we could bring back the old fans in addition to bringing in new fans. It's something to consider."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4550570-ss_d8cc60fa4b89a81d78b394cdf3e5aa8895aa0d18.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4550570" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4550570-ss_d8cc60fa4b89a81d78b394cdf3e5aa8895aa0d18.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4550570"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4550570-ss_d8cc60fa4b89a81d78b394cdf3e5aa8895aa0d18.1920x1080.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">While VF5 REVO <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fDp345gGlJ8">had a full tournament</a> as part of the Evo Extended Lineup, what many VF players at the event were hoping to see was the New Virtua Fighter Project. Sega did not disappoint, with a gameplay showcase trailer in the Evo Arena on finals day debuting to cheers and awestruck gasps (and my frenzied screams of delight). With my anticipation continuing at a fever pitch, I was eager to chat with producer Riichiro Yamada about the upcoming game.</p><p dir="ltr">Though only a select few characters have been shown so far, those that have, such as Akira and Wolf, have seen some big changes to their appearance. They also look markedly older, potentially indicating the passage of time in the VF world. I asked Yamada if he could tell us a bit more about these changes. "We can't say much just yet, but yes, the time has passed on. The setting for VF5 was roughly around the year 2006. This game is not a parallel world or an alternate universe--it's based on a certain timeline."</p><p dir="ltr">Yamada also elaborated on how they're approaching character design this time around: "So up until now, the characters have been designed based on their combat style, with a short backstory for each character. We're redesigning them now based on their lifestyle, why they are fighting, what they are fighting for. That's the new approach that we've been taking."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4550571-ss_66ed24c38e69d3364e96b68fd86cd943a24db064.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4550571" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4550571-ss_66ed24c38e69d3364e96b68fd86cd943a24db064.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4550571"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4550571-ss_66ed24c38e69d3364e96b68fd86cd943a24db064.1920x1080.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">One of the most talked-about elements of what's been shown so far--and that's been generating even more buzz with the Evo gameplay showcase trailer--has been the realism and fluidity of the combat animation, with details like characters having distinct guarding animations for specific attacks. "We really want people to be able to see the changes that we've made," says Yamada. "Virtua Fighter up until now might have been seen as very plain, not very flashy. However, we don't want to change it up too drastically--we want a cool, flashy sense of realism. Change it, but don't lose the essence."</p><p dir="ltr">"In the process of creating this game, I'm always thinking, 'What can we progress? What can we evolve? What can we make improvements on?' When I was a child, I used to watch kung-fu movies. Those movies make people and their combat look very exciting. I really wanted to bring that element into the game--the flow, like the smoothness, all the things I used to see in those classic kung-fu movies, you know, make people excited by watching those. That's the approach I've been taking right now."</p><p dir="ltr">"Before we released those trailers, I didn't know how the users would respond," he continues. "But seeing everyone enjoying it, I'm really relieved to see that players are excited."</p><div tabindex="0" data-id="68039291" data-promo-id="0" data-user-has-ads="1"

skills executed with directional movements. Only one game in the series--Virtua Fighter 3--significantly altered the control scheme by adding a fourth button. With the new Virtua Fighter making some clear visual changes, I wondered if the game would try anything new with the control scheme. "We're trying a lot of different things as we're fleshing out gameplay," Yamada answered. "But VF started as an arcade game, with deliberately simple controls. Punch-kick-guard is easy for players to grasp. So while I can't give specifics, the concept that I have in mind is 'anyone can play anyone can play easily, without any stress.'"</p><p dir="ltr">This being a game by Ryu ga Gotoku Studio--a team known for its storytelling prowess and character-building--many are expecting a heavy emphasis on story this time around compared to previous titles. "Previously, VF lacked much of an in-game narrative. Again, I can't say too much, but I would like people to look forward to how we put the narrative and gameplay elements together at the finish line."</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>It’s been a <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/samadams.bsky.social/post/3lwbtrctwwk2t" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">grim month</a> for the field of criticism: the New York Times <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/maxtani.bsky.social/post/3lvle3phwms2u" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reassigned veteran critics</a>, WaPo’s <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/alanzilberman.bsky.social/post/3lvcmz6zvf22c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">took a buyout</a>, Vanity Fair elected to <a href="https://variety.com/2025/digital/news/vanity-fair-cut-back-coverage-hollywood-focus-mark-guiducci-1236487458/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">eliminate reviews</a>, and Associated Press <a href="https://bookriot.com/associated-press-to-end-weekly-book-reviews/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">did the same</a> with its book reviews. It’s beginning to look like curtains for criticism—at least of the traditional sort—but do not conflate the mercurial winds of economic change with a lack of need. On this week’s Aftermath Hours, we talk about that.</p><p>This time around we’re joined by our former Kotaku colleague <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/dreamcastaway.bsky.social" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Harper Jay</a> for a discussion of criticism’s role in a world that seems determined to reject it—or at least cast it out of mainstream publications, as well as many video game publications. What does it mean for institutions to cede this ground to fandoms and social media? What do we lose when we cease to respect the expertise that goes into well-considered critical work—or even eliminate the idea of “critic” as a legitimate role or job altogether?&nbsp;</p><p>Then we talk about the news of the week: Unionized workers at Arkane, a Microsoft-owned studio, released a statement <a href="https://aftermath.site/microsoft-azure-arkane-israel-palestine-genocide" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">decrying the company’s complicity in Israel’s genocide</a> of Palestinians—a subject that hits close to home for Harper, who until very recently worked at Double Fine, another Microsoft studio. Finally, Gita explains why Eevee is the best Pokémon design (it’s a prism through which to view the infinite possibilities of childhood, obviously).&nbsp;</p><p>You can find this week's episode below and on <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/7qtlX6MNeEoyNuHBU0chUJ?si=a2f12b75911f43cb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Spotify</a>, <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/aftermath-hours/id1727407094" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Apple</a>, or wherever else you prefer to listen to podcasts. If you like what you hear, make sure to leave a review so that we can hire so many in-house critics that we’ll have to build a whole other house just for them.</p><p>Here’s an excerpt from our conversation (edited for length and clarity):</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> We’ve been talking a lot about fandom and the way people discuss things online – and the flattening of a whole bunch of different ideas that could be considered attempts at criticism, but mostly turn into arguments or policing people for not demonstrating sufficient ideological purity or whatever. And then we have publications ceding that ground and effectively saying that the traditional notion of a critic is something they’re no longer interested in. As a result, you could potentially say that the idea of being a career critic is going away, or becoming something you can only do on YouTube or whatever. What are your feelings on that dynamic shift?&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Harper: </strong>It’s wrong. It’s wrong in the sense that anybody can call themselves a critic in the same way that anybody can say that they’re a journalist. The answer is: No you fucking aren’t. That’s a mean thing to say, and it’s not a question of their intentions; it’s a question of their ability. Which is not a popular sentiment to share, but the reason that newspapers have people who are critics is because it is a talent you develop just like anything else. It’s just like with people who say “I’m a journalist” and then just put “BREAKING” in front of all their tweets, that’s not the same thing as being a reporter. There are processes, there’s a body of knowledge that you have, there’s a tradition that you are connected to, there are standards that you hold yourself to.&nbsp;</p><p>It’s cool, and it’s often very good, that someone can jump on YouTube and make two hours of something that is incredibly personal and moving, and it’s right there; in some ways, there’s no barrier to entry. Anyone can do it. But also, the reason that you have positions at outlets or newspapers – and the reason why getting rid of them is bad – is because you’re ceding that process to people who do not have experience or training or standards.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Gita:</strong> When I was working at Vice, I shifted pretty hard into criticism in a form I really enjoy—I wrote <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/when-joss-whedon-was-our-master/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the Joss Whedon thing</a> and <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/aaron-sorkins-liberal-fantasy-runs-the-world/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the Aaron Sorkin thing</a>—and I literally could not have written those things without [editor] Tim Marchman.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Harper: </strong>I miss him.</p><p><strong>Gita:</strong> I was texting him the other day, and it made me miss him a lot—him and his weird tinned fish obsession.</p><p>He gave me a lot of tools and provided me with things to read. He told me ways to approach these questions that I was trying to answer that I couldn’t have found on my own. Even just the process of getting on the phone with him and being like “I’m thinking X, Y, Z,” and he was like “Have you tried A, B, C,” those things helped me get my wheels turning in ways that I could not have done without him.&nbsp;</p><p>Criticism for me is often a collaborative process, even if I’m just getting up and going to my husband in the other room and saying, “I can’t figure out how to do this transition from one paragraph to the other. Can you help me understand what I’m trying to say here?” I know I could not be someone who gets on YouTube and talks for three hours about a movie. I need an editor. I need someone to help put guardrails on my arguments so I don’t fly off into random tangents.</p><p>There are people on YouTube who I think do a great job at criticism. I just watched a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xZQv1_oosZg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">seven-hour video about <em>Midsommar </em>and all the symbolism in it</a>, and the person who made the video, Novum, went so far as to reach out to actors on the film and production designers —so a really, really robust attempt to actually look at the work and think about meaning and how these symbols come together and create new meanings.&nbsp;</p><p>That’s possible [to do in the YouTube ecosystem]. But you can see and tell that this person comes from a tradition of talking and thinking about art in that way. And that kind of video is surrounded by other videos that are just like “<em>Midsommar</em> Ending Explained.”</p><p><strong>Nathan: </strong>You could even say those types of videos are the majority now. That’s the main form of discourse around these types of media, whether we’re talking games, TV, film, or whatever else, and then as an outlier you have people digging into something and trying to talk specifically about themes and the ideas a work is trying to explore – which I think is often the point when an artist creates something. But people are getting hung up on “Oh, there’s a plot hole here.”</p><p><strong>Gita: </strong>Or literally even dumber, [a lot of videos] are just about what happened. “What was the sequence of events I just watched?” You can use your own brain to figure that out!</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> It’s the plot section of a Wikipedia page.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Gita: </strong>You can see the lack of facility here. And of course now a lot of those “Blah blah blah ending explained” videos are AI slop. AI voiceover and ChatGPT script put together with algorithmic editing of random clips from the film. That is worrying to me, because it’s not just about lack of media literacy—although I know that’s a popular conversation topic these days. It’s about a lack of curiosity. Not wanting to do the thinking yourself, but wanting something else to do the thinking for you—it is the thing that really concerns me about widespread use of ChatGPT.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/alien-earth-noah-hawley-fx-hulu-ridley-scott"><h3>Alien: Earth Has The Juice</h3></a><p>I was skeptical, but Noah Hawley has not let me down yet.</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/cyberpunk-urban-design"><h3>What Cyberpunk 2077 Can Teach Real-World Cities</h3></a><p>Night City's urban design highlights the problems, and solutions, real cities deal with around walkability, housing, and mixed-use areas</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/iwalkfree-review-broken-foot"><h3>I Broke My Foot But The iWalkFree Gave Me Mobility Back</h3></a><p>Breaking your foot sucks, but the iWalkFree 3.0 gets you half way to walking again with some minor caveats.</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div><br/><br/>https://aftermath.site/aftermath-hours-podcast-nty-wapo-vanity-fair-critics]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>By the time the credits rolled on the first episode of the new FX series <em>Alien: Earth</em>, I was shocked by how much I enjoyed it. Other than the first two films, <em>Alien</em> and <em>Aliens</em>, the legacy of the groundbreaking science fiction series has been divisive, to say the least. When I saw that Noah Hawley, who has also developed television adaptations of <em>Fargo</em> and created the X-Men series <em>Legion</em>, was credited for both directing and writing the series, I knew that we’re all in good hands.</p><p>I gave up on there being another good <em>Alien</em> movie a long time ago. As a general rule, I’m not a fan of extending something into a franchise when a story feels complete. <em>Alien</em> was its own complete story—one that gestured at a wider world, but a story with a beginning, middle and end. It’s extraordinarily lucky that <em>Aliens</em> is also an amazing movie, though an action movie rather than a compact science fiction thriller. But after these two successes, there’s been a series of duds and half starts, and some outright abominations (<em>Alien vs. Predator</em>).</p><p>As much as I personally enjoy a movie like <em>Alien: Covenant</em>, it is an objective truth that even the return of director Ridley Scott could not bring back the magic of that first <em>Alien</em> movie. As much as I like <em>Alien: Romulus</em>, it too relies on nostalgia for the past rather than creating new places for the story to go. This is not the case with <em>Alien: Earth</em>, which has two episodes streaming on Hulu right now. I think a large part of that is Noah Hawley.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Alien: Earth | Official Trailer | FX" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZbsiKjVAV28?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>The first show written by Hawley that I watched was <em>Legion</em>, which is an adaptation of <em>X-Men</em>, sort of. It follows David Haller, a mutant in a mental hospital who later learns that the things he thought were mental illness were actually his mutant powers manifesting. Though the show becomes more uneven the longer it goes on, it’s always ambitious and visually adventurous. Instead of putting a hand to his temple and squinting, Haller’s psychic powers are portrayed as dance offs, Bollywood musical sequences, and at one point, a duet between him and his nemesis of the song “Behind Blue Eyes.”&nbsp;</p><p><em>Legion</em> manages to capture aspects of the X-Men and mutant culture that exist in comics that never makes it into the movies: mutants are discriminated against, and therefore a lot of them end up in the dregs of society. What would it feel like to have potentially world altering power, but also be in the throes of a drug addiction? Similarly, Hawley’s <em>Fargo</em> show is more than just a series of crime stories. It tries to grasp at the tone, and especially the humor, of the Coen Brothers’ film without retreading plot points too closely.</p><p>This is the great strength of <em>Alien: Earth</em>. It isn’t just another game of cat and mouse with the infamous xenomorph—though there is still plenty of suspense centered around where the xenomorph currently is, and where it’s going to go next. Like the original film, it’s also about how megacorporations like the fictional Weyland Yutani treat its workers as expendable in their quest to learn the secrets of immortality from the nigh indestructible xenomorph. In a way, the xenomorph itself becomes a literalization of the extractive nature of capitalism: it takes from people and hollows them out from the inside, all in the service of replicating itself. All of the entries in the <em>Alien</em> franchise that I enjoy makes that tension a part of their narratives.</p><figure><figcaption>Image Source: <a href="https://www.fxnetworks.com/shows/alien-earth/galleries/first-look" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">FX</a></figcaption></figure><p>Much of the first episode of <em>Alien: Earth</em> is about a new megacorp, Prodigy, which is experimenting in transferring consciousness from children with terminal illnesses into adult synthetic bodies.These synthetics have child minds, but they are in adult bodies, leading to some fun acting choices with these adult actors trying to portray that mentally these characters are all about eleven or twelve. Due to the secrecy surrounding this new technology, Prodigy does not allow these synthetics to return to their families ever again. The first child transferred into an adult synthetic body, Wendy, is allowed to see her brother, but only from a distance, watching him through viewscreens but never allowed to contact him.</p><p>In the first episode, a space craft crashes into a skyscraper, and Wendy watches her brother jump into action as a first responder. Wendy talks her handler into allowing her and her fellow synthetics to assist in rescuing people, and doing a bit of corporate espionage on the side. Of course–of course!—there is a xenomorph on that very ship. And boy howdy does it love tearing people apart.</p><p>More than just the fascinating mysteries that Hawley sets up in its first two episodes—the circumstances of how the xenomorph broke free from containment on a space ship, leading to it crashing into a populated city, are so far unrevealed—<em>Alien: Earth</em> is gorgeous to look at. The camera swings and careens down narrow hallways, picking up speed as if it's on a rollercoaster. There is detail packed into every frame, things moving behind people’s heads as they examine the crash, something scuttling in the background as they turn each corner. Most impressive to me are the show's use of soft fades to transition from shot to shot, overlaying images on top of each other into a collage. It all feels thoughtful and considered, a show you cannot watch while looking at your phone.</p><p>For a long time I never wanted an entry in the <em>Alien</em> series where the xenomorph comes to Earth. Hell, I thought most of the entries where the xenomorph is in space were cheap cash grabs relying on nostalgia—a xenomorph on Earth felt creatively bankrupt, as if the series were scraping at the bottom of the barrel to win back fans. After watching two episodes of <em>Alien: Earth</em> I stand corrected. There is something interesting in the idea of a corporation unleashing something this deadly on humanity, only to watch their plans all go up in flames.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/aftermath-hours-podcast-nty-wapo-vanity-fair-critics"><h3>Despite What NYT, WaPo, And Vanity Fair Seem To Think, We Still Need Critics</h3></a><p>"You’re ceding that process to people who do not have experience or training or standards"</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/cyberpunk-urban-design"><h3>What Cyberpunk 2077 Can Teach Real-World Cities</h3></a><p>Night City's urban design highlights the problems, and solutions, real cities deal with around walkability, housing, and mixed-use areas</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/iwalkfree-review-broken-foot"><h3>I Broke My Foot But The iWalkFree Gave Me Mobility Back</h3></a><p>Breaking your foot sucks, but the iWalkFree 3.0 gets you half way to walking again with some minor caveats.</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div><br/><br/>https://aftermath.site/alien-earth-noah-hawley-fx-hulu-ridley-scott]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              
              <p>The overwhelming consensus among the first hands-on demos with <em>Borderlands 4</em> earlier this summer was that <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/fps/borderlands-4-hands-on-preview/">it’s more of the same</a>. If you already like <em>Borderlands</em>, the sequel is likely to provide everything fans usually show up for. If not, well, TBD on how many nonbelievers Gearbox Entertainment manages to win over with its most ambitious looter shooter yet. Much of that will come down to the details, and the studio has been sharing a lot of them recently. Here’s a bunch of stuff we learned <a href="https://kotaku.com/borderlands-4-price-tag-70-drama-pitchford-80-real-fan-1851784583">about <em>Borderlands 4</em> this week</a>.</p> <h2>Split-screen co-op returns</h2> <p>Senior project producer Anthony Nicholson<a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/08/12/how-borderlands-4-built-for-co-op-ground-up/"> wrote on Xbox Wire this week</a> that in addition to supporting local co-op, <em>Borderlands 4</em> will also let you play with another pair of people in split-screen mode. Two TVs, four-player sessions, tons of chaos. Teaming up has also apparently been streamlined with a better lobby system and improved dynamic level scaling, including the option for each player to set their own difficulty.</p> <h2>Switch 2 won’t have couch co-op</h2> <p>“Switch 2 players will have the same exciting <em>Borderlands 4</em> experience as other platforms minus the split-screen option, and yes, it will have full cross-play with Epic, Steam, PlayStation 5, and Xbox X|S,” reads <a href="https://support.borderlands.com/hc/en-us/articles/43481582561939-Borderlands-4-Nintendo-Switch-2-FAQ#h_01K1XYNFY9RTPMT184WZ70D421">the Nintendo version’s support page</a>. The port targets 30fps and arrives on October 3, roughly three weeks after the platforms.</p>

 <h2>There are over 30 billion guns</h2> <p>Yes, that’s a real stat Gearbox is pushing. One of the reasons for that big number is that <em>Borderlands 4</em> lets you mix-and-match elements from different in-universe weapons manufacturers. Then there are all of the RNG stat and perk drops you can get. According to Nicholson, the studio created a Matrix-like gun rack to help conceptualize all the possibilities and prevent the game from spitting out combinations that wouldn’t work.</p> <p>“It was this really large gun map where you could see all of the individual parts for all the individual guns, for all the individual manufacturers,” he <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/news/borderlands-randy-pitchford-interview-borderlands-4">told the Epic Games Store blog</a>. “It made it so you could see how each of those things were and how we could have those combinations roll together and how they would work—the slides, the animators, the actions, the art all fitting together. Because a certain gun, if it pumps one way, but there’s a long barrel that goes on the bottom, obviously those parts can’t go together.”</p> <h2><em>Borderlands 4</em> has “more passive perks than all the previous <em>Borderlands</em> combined”</h2> <p>Size matters, at least for <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Borderlands4/comments/1lh1qm0/borderlands_4_long_info_dump_compiled_from_32/">Gearbox’s marketing guys</a>. The <em>Borderlands 4</em> map is bigger than the last two numbered entries combined. The guns have four times as many polygons as <em>Borderlands 3</em>. All those billions of guns. You get the idea. The skill tree follows a similar pattern. It sounds more advanced, and potentially overwhelming, than any game prior—more <em>Diablo 4</em> or<em> Path of Exile</em> than your traditional RPG shooter.</p>

 <p>“The Augment and the Capstone system that we have forces you to make a choice and all of them drastically change the ability that each player has,” character designer Nick Thurston <a href="https://www.polygon.com/borderlands-4-passive-perks-interview-gearbox/">told <em>Polygon</em></a>. “That <em>alone&nbsp;</em>would create more build diversity than we’ve ever had. But then we also have more passives than all the previous Borderlands combined. I think Amon alone has 87 passives, and most Vault Hunters have about 80.”</p> <h2>Techno Viking Amon is<em> Borderland</em>‘s “most complicated” Vault Hunter yet</h2> <p>Amon is the guy with the big fire and ice axes you see in all the <em>Borderlands 4</em> trailers. But looks can be deceiving. He’s not just a tanky melee character. He’s apparently the poster child for the new game’s build variety. Everyone in a squad could play as Amon, but the styles might all be different, Gearbox claims. Melee, ranged, support, he can do it all. Unlike most of the franchise’s Vault Hunters that pop abilities and then just shoot stuff, Amon’s skills can be deployed in more ways.</p>

 <p>“He just has more abilities than any other Vault Hunter numerically because of his trait, which allows him to have forge skills,” Thurston <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4s-amon-is-a-more-complicated-vault-hunter-to-play-than-past-options/1100-6533956/">told <em>GameSpot</em></a>. “I wouldn’t say he’s super complicated, but he has a lot more going on in the middle of combat, and he’s a lot more active than I think a lot of people historically expect from Vault Hunters.” He sounds like a more advanced archetype than some of the others, though Gearbox says he’s still approachable to new players.</p> <h2><em>Borderlands 4</em> is inspired by mergers, acquisitions, and fascism</h2> <p>The game takes place on a prison planet called Kairos. Gearbox CEO Randy Pitchford suggests that’s a not-so-subtle illusion to the studio’s rocky period during which it was sold to the <a href="https://kotaku.com/borderlands-4-gearbox-embracer-acquisition-1851297286">poorly conceived Embracer holding company</a>, before trying to escape again. The studio group is now owned by longtime publishing partner 2K Games, part of the broader Take-Two portfolio that includes <em>Grand Theft Auto VI</em> maker Rockstar Games and mobile maker Zynga.</p> <p>“There’s this cultural and emotional shift in me, personally, and at the studio. What does it mean to trade some autonomy for organization?” he told <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/news/borderlands-randy-pitchford-interview-borderlands-4">the Epic Games Store blog</a>: “What does it feel like to move up and down the scale between autonomy and being organized or even being controlled? On one end of a spectrum you have anarchy, and on the other end of the spectrum you have fascism, totalitarianism, zero freedom. It’s not just about societies—that’s all of us as individuals, to imagine where we want to be on that spectrum and how comfortable we are. And we were going through that as a company.”</p>

<section><p>Amid uncertainty for the future of alternative games, these developers share a resolve to keep going.</p></section>
        
        
                    
              <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p dir="ltr">When thousands of works were deindexed from Itch just a few weeks ago, livelihoods hung in the balance.</p><p dir="ltr">Itch hosted the works of developers, artists, writers, and zinesters. It was (and is) home to taboo pornography, garden-variety smut, video game memoirs, and game jam detritus. Over the last five years, it has perhaps become best known for hosting massive charity bundles, supporting causes like Black Lives Matter, Ukraine war relief, and Palestinian liberation. Those bundles were lined with small projects from hobbyist creators alongside big hits from professional developers. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/itch-io-joins-steam-in-recent-push-to-ban-adult-games/1100-6533423/">When payment processors forced Itch to de-index thousands of games </a>following a pressure campaign from a right-wing anti-porn group, they threatened all of these avenues of artistic expression and financial income.</p><p dir="ltr">Nathalie Lawhead, a developer and artist who has hosted their work on Itch for years, is one of the creators who could be affected by the large-scale push for increased censorship. Their game, Everything is Going to Be Okay, is part of the permanent collection in the Museum of Modern Art in New York City. But despite its acceptance into a major hub of mainstream arts culture, their work has struggled to find a home in the world of video games.</p><p dir="ltr">"The work I host on Itch is all the work that I had struggled in the past to get on mainstream storefronts... I can't count the number of times that my work has been rejected because of reasons like ’simulated error’ (glitch art), or because it features a visual style a storefront deems inappropriate, or because it is built a certain way that's not standard enough for these storefronts," Lawhead said over email.</p><p dir="ltr">Lawhead's work is not, strictly speaking, "gamey." They have described Everything is Going to Be Okay as a zine, and their upcoming game Blue Suburbia as an interactive poem. Lawhead's words and their work reflect a broader truth about Itch: that it has acted as a bastion for the weird and off-center from its inception.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4550338-exvhos.png" data-ref-id="1300-4550338" data-ratio="0.6669167291823" data-width="1333" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4550338-exvhos.png" data-ref-id="1300-4550338"></a><figcaption>An image from Lawhead's Everything is Going to Be Okay</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4550338-exvhos.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">For Lawhead and many other developers, the mass de-indexing represents a threat to that weirdness, whether their works are NSFW or not. In our conversation, Lawhead emphasized, "We are losing our ability to create work like this, slowly."</p><p dir="ltr">Other developers worry about the effect these bans will have on their thought process.</p><p dir="ltr">"I almost included a sex scene in my game Spring Gothic, but if I had put a sex scene in there, it would have been delisted," visual novel developer and critic Kastel said on a phone call. "I don't want to think like that. That's self-censorship."</p><p dir="ltr">For Howling Angel Games founder Olivia Nenmyx, their freedom to approach sensitive topics was hard-won.</p><p dir="ltr">"I had a lot of religious or psychological guilt around abnormal kink," they said over Zoom. "It took a lot of therapy and encouragement to start writing porn."</p><p dir="ltr">It's that experience that makes them determined to fight for the right of expression, but also frightened of what this precedent could mean.</p><p dir="ltr">"I know first-hand how strong the pressure to fall-in-line can be. I see a lot of people shying away from or not expressing themselves in ways that are controversial," Nenmyx said.</p><p dir="ltr">In kind, Kastel sees a danger in trying to police more taboo work.</p><p dir="ltr">"The executives, they don't really care if works are SFW or NSFW. Those are terms that creators and players decide," she said. "In the end, the payment processors are deciding everything and they have their own paradigms."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4550339-weemdu.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4550339" data-ratio="0.75" data-width="1200" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4550339-weemdu.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4550339"></a><figcaption>An image from Kastel's Spring Gothic</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4550339-weemdu.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">In addition to these concerns, the de-indexing has caused a lot of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/one-of-the-greatest-pc-games-of-2024-was-removed-from-itch-io-search-results/1100-6533495/">confusion and misinformation</a>. Press and players cited Consume Me and Mouthwashing as examples of affected games, but Itch had actually de-indexed both games before receiving pressure from payment processors, for unrelated reasons. The mess has caused some developers to criticize Itch fiercely, claiming the storefront should have done more, both to protect developers and warn them about what was happening.</p><p dir="ltr">Lawhead, however, believes that Itch deserves some benefit of the doubt.</p><p dir="ltr">"They don't have the resources that a place like Steam does," Lawhead said. "They are about as indie as I am. It's not hard to knock something like that off its feet and make it impossible for it to get back up... The only way to fight this is to understand that we are all in this together, and that includes<a href="http://itch.io/" rel="nofollow "> Itch.io</a> too."</p><p dir="ltr">But the question remains: How and where should independent artists share their work? As "someone that's already tried every possible alternative" and "that's been very vocal about alternatives out there," Lawhead admits they are skeptical there are real substitutes for Itch. Indeed, in the weeks since this policy changed the landscape of Itch, no obvious new options have emerged--although the dust is still settling and it is unclear what will remain in the aftermath or if Itch's policies will change. But the threat payment processors pose to marginal work is bigger than Itch or even Steam. True alternatives may be hard to find.</p><p dir="ltr">Some developers are already planning to divest. While Nenmyx wants to maintain a relationship with Itch, they are actively looking for alternatives and have added a storefront to their studio's website.</p><p dir="ltr">"I will continue to host free demos on Itch to try and get people onto my site, but I don't think I'm going to host paid content on Itch in the future," they said. "That's not set in stone though."</p><p dir="ltr">Kastel believes that trust will be slow to return, if it comes back at all.</p><p dir="ltr">"Even if Itch survives, people are going to be concerned that their games will be pulled off," Katel said. "The optimal way is probably, make a jam on Itch, but also upload a mirror copy somewhere else, like the Internet Archive."</p><p dir="ltr">But while individuals scramble for potential solutions, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/itch-and-steams-new-policies-reflect-a-larger-battle-on-free-speech/1100-6533750/">the stakes of the broader fight remain high</a>. For Lawhead, the fate of Itch could set a precedent that would affect our online lives in every way.</p><p dir="ltr">"Given the bigger context of how corporations and monopolies have funneled everyone into these heavily-controlled walled gardens that now occupy our daily online lives, or even the way us developers can distribute software... I don't think there's any coming back from this."</p><p dir="ltr">It's hard not to see what they mean, as the<a href="https://www.techradar.com/vpn/vpn-privacy-security/case-dismissed-wikipedia-loses-uk-online-safety-act-legal-challenge-but-it-may-still-be-safe-from-age-checks" rel="nofollow "> UK threatens the country's access to Wikipedia</a> or as Steam removes games like Vile: Exhumed. But Lawhead is not giving up.</p><p dir="ltr">"We need Itch.io to live," they said. "We need our own precedent."</p>

It's cooled by a very robust 360mm all-in-one liquid cooling system and run off an 850W power supply.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">The Radeon RX 9070 XT Received a 10/10 at IGN</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">We rated the AMD Radeon RX 9070 XT a "perfect" 10/10. Even though it costs $150 less than the Nvidia GeForce RTX 5070 Ti, the 9070 XT beats it out in several of the games we tested. In a few benchmarks, the results aren't even close. The 9070 XT is also comparable in performance to the older $1,000 RX 7900 XTX but with better ray tracing and upscaling performance than its predecessor. It does lose out on VRAM (16GB vs 24GB), but that isn't really an issue for gaming. By "4K ready" I mean that this gaming PC can run pretty much any game at 4K resolution and at framerates of 60fps or higher. Any video card that's weaker and you'll have to compromise in order to get playable framerates. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">The Battlefield 6 Beta Runs This Weekend</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Battlefield 6 is out in October and there's one final open beta that runs August 14-17.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              
              <p><span>This weekend is a big one for fans and players of competitive </span><i><span>Pokémon</span></i><span>. Thousands of fans are gathering in the Anaheim Convention Center to watch the best of the best battle each other in </span><i><span>Scarlet </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Violet</span></i><span>. However, not everyone is there to have a good time. For some people, the cost of attendance is merely a business expense. Like </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/mcdonalds-pokemon-scalpers-happy-meal-toys-japan-2000617978"><span>every other </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>event or collaboration</span></a><span> in recent memory, </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-scalper-reseller-trading-card-van-gogh-pikachu-1850925900"><span>scalpers</span></a><span> have </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-world-championship-merchandise-scalper-reseller-2000617744"><span>descended upon Anaheim</span></a><span> to buy up exclusive </span><i><span>Pokémon</span></i><span> merch and then sell it for a profit. I really wanted to go to Worlds this year, as I’ve been a </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>fan most of my life and still haven’t been to one of the championship competitions, but while the tournament is just beginning, the vibes seem so rancid I’m not sure it would make for a great first impression.</span></p> <p><span>It seems like every other week we here at </span><i><span>Kotaku </span></i><span>are writing about some absolute nonsense in the </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>community, as scalpers have made full-time jobs out of buying up cards and collectibles for a quick buck. The controversial practice has become so lucrative for these grown-ass adults that sales devolve into </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-adults-men-fighting-over-restock-machine-tiktok-1851768074"><span>actual acts of violence</span></a><span> or crowds end up </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-van-gogh-museum-scalpers-pikachu-card-1850882131"><span>jockeying to rummage through shelves</span></a><span> like it’s Black Friday. Part of me feels some sympathy for people who have to resort to this because times are tough and it’s easier than hard labor, but especially considering this franchise has probably brought me more joy than any other for most of my life, it really sucks to see that every new event or merch drop now makes me feel so deeply cynical.</span></p> <p><span>The Anaheim event has only been going on for a day, and there are already </span><a href="https://x.com/michmalllow/status/1956092730708516956"><span>reports of resellers setting up shop in neighboring hotels</span></a><span> near the convention center, with others responding by putting up signage </span><a href="https://x.com/predaconspittor/status/1956151255124029911"><span>prohibiting such wheeling and dealing</span></a><span>. Competitive players are </span><a href="https://x.com/NicholasMoffit2/status/1956059599569916167"><span>posting on social media</span></a><span> about selling merchandise for more than they paid for it. What is supposed to be a giant community gathering has become something else entirely, and it’s made it harder to be a fan when you can’t even engage with it without having to push through people with bad intentions.</span></p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">I really really dislike how pokemon worlds has turned from a celebration of competitive pokemon to taking anything remotely valuable and scalping it for a profit.</p> <p>— Tyson Blätter (@T_Blatt) <a href="https://twitter.com/T_Blatt/status/1956007686190866633?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 14, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Worlds Pokemon Center showing us once again that capitalism ruins everything people love 🙂</p> <p>— Sawyer Melban (@sawyerhatemail) <a href="https://twitter.com/sawyerhatemail/status/1955874877724090578?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 14, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">I don’t understand why some people are complaining that we brought our daughter to the Pokemon Center yesterday.

So it begs the question: Is </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>just cooked as a hobby now? After nearly 30 years, has the franchise’s reputation become so sullied by people who buy its merchandise just to sell it to other people that longtime devotees are leaving it behind? The </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>franchise is too far-reaching to really be affected by this phenomenon, which a lot of collectors believe is why The Pokémon Company doesn’t do much to really stop it. Purchase limits on new merchandise are helpful, but they don’t stop scalpers from showing up before stores put cards on the shelf, making multiple accounts to purchase items online, or causing a ruckus at events like Worlds. </span></p> <p><span>You would think constantly being in the headlines for robberies, chaotic sales, and even actual violence associated with your product would be damaging enough to the brand that TPC would be motivated to take real action. But again, </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>is so prolific that TPC doesn’t actually receive any chip damage from this. A sale to a scalper puts the same amount of money in Pikachu’s pockets as one to a devoted fan. The assembly line will keep going, and unless people stop buying from them, scalpers will keep showing up. As I said earlier, </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>has brought me more joy than probably any other series. These days, however, that joy is getting drowned out by cynicism every time some event takes place that should be reminding me why I fell in love with </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>in the first place.</span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Just a week after its release, Mafia: The Old Country is adding a fan-favorite mode to the game for players to try out that many are sure to enjoy.</p>



<p>The game, which received decent reviews from critics and fans, took the story back to its roots in 1900s Sicily. From the start, the game made a point to change many controversial aspects from Mafia 3. The biggest was to return the series to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/mafia-the-old-country-devs-removed-open-world-because-of-mafia-3/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a more linear format</a>, akin to Mafia 1 and 2. Yet, with the returning mode, announced on the game’s official website, that may not be the case.</p>



<h2 id="h-free-ride-mode-is-coming-to-mafia-the-old-country">Free Ride Mode is Coming to Mafia: The Old Country</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Image via 2K</figcaption></figure>



<p>In a <a href="https://mafia.2k.com/the-old-country/news/free-ride-mode/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">thank you message</a> from the team, Hangar 13 and 2K Games hyped up the future of the gangster series’ fourth entry. To celebrate, the team announced the return of Free Ride mode, which made its debut in Mafia: Definitive Edition. The mode allowed players to ride and drive around the open world and take on a variety of optional missions. Mostly, it serves as a great way to take in the beautiful sceneries, especially now with the Italian countryside. While the game is linear, Free Ride isn’t technically open world like Mafia 3, but it’s a rather interesting addition.</p>



<p>The mode will be available for free at a later date, along with new content for players to enjoy. While details were sparse on the timing and specifics, it does bode well for returning fans. Toward the end, we got some fun statistics on player behavior to look at. For example, 600 million bullets were fired, though only 185 million enemies were hit by them. Regardless of the decent reception, it seems Hangar 13 and 2K Games are planning to stick with the Torrisi family for a while longer.</p>

Playing alone or with friends, you'll enter a circular zone with a vent that dumps out piles of triangles that you then have to transfer into a bucket on the opposite side of the room. You'll have a quota to hit each round before a timer on the wall hits zero, with the quota increasing between rounds.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">To keep the cash flowing in, you'll need to devise smart new ways to transfer triangles, using conveyor belts you can buy from the breakroom between rounds to construct inventive triangle-delivering contraptions. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Callum Williams is an IGN freelancer covering features and guides.

Although GeForce RTX 5080 graphics card prices are trending downwards, you still can't find it for under $1,000, so you'd be hard pressed to build your own diy PC for cheaper.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Alienware Aurora RTX 5080 Gaming PC From $2,149.99</h2><div id="215911" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger" catalogid="a25177bf-886b-4d72-b109-40de6e2e9e15"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Alienware Aurora R16 Intel Core Ultra 7 265F RTX 5080 Gaming PC (16GB/1TB)</h3></p></div><div id="225993" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger" catalogid="a25177bf-886b-4d72-b109-40de6e2e9e15"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Alienware Aurora R16 Intel Core Ultra 9 285K RTX 5080 Gaming PC (32GB/1TB)</h3></p></div><div catalogid="a25177bf-886b-4d72-b109-40de6e2e9e15" id="221539"><div id="221539" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Alienware Aurora R16 Intel Core Ultra 9 285K RTX 5080 Gaming PC (64GB/2TB)</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">There are three tiers of this Alienware RTX 5080 gaming PC currently discounted.

For gaming, you won't see much of an improvement upgrading to a Core Ultra 9, especially if you plan to play at high resolutions where the GPU makes much more of an impact.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>It's only the second week of its open beta, but <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/battlefield-6/">Battlefield 6</a> is already looking like it'll be the game to take over 2025 with how strong its player numbers are on Steam alone. The second week of the beta has already surpassed <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/3081410/charts/">400K concurrent players on Steam</a>, and now analyst Rhys Elliot of Alinea Analytics is predicting that the game will hit 1 million pre-orders on Steam, after having already hit over 600K. </p>



<p>On X (formerly Twitter), Elliot <a href="https://x.com/superhys/status/1955282226632925315">shared</a> a few key data points from Alinea Analytics' tracking of Battlefield 6, like how the firm is claiming that the game has already surpassed 605K pre-orders, and that EA stands to make $35 million in pre-sales revenue. </p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Battlefield6?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Battlefield6</a> is on track for a huge launch this year, if it can stick the landing. </p><p>Some Alinea Analytics Steam metrics for you:</p><p>🎯605 K copies sold via preorder🎯<br>💰Pre-order revenues of $35 million💰<br>🙏2.7 million Steam wishlists🙏<br>📈521 K people playing the beta CCUs📈 <a href="https://t.co/UOlS5L5MPP">pic.twitter.com/UOlS5L5MPP</a></p></div>— Rhys Elliott (@superhys) <a href="https://twitter.com/superhys/status/1955282226632925315?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 12, 2025</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>In a recent interview with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-6-the-best-battlefield-has-ever-done-one-million-in-steam-pre-orders">Eurogamer</a>, Elliot elaborated on his predictions for Battlefield 6, saying that he believes it will pass "<em>a million in pre-sales</em>," and that the continued success of the game will be dependent on how EA can carry the momentum the beta is building into launch, and if it can stand out among other major shooters being released close to it, like Borderlands 4.</p>



<p>"<em>As we head into the Autumn period there'll be a lot more going on, but as of right now it's on track to do extremely well: the best Battlefield has ever done</em>,<em>" </em>Elliot said.</p>



<p>That said, Elliot is more realistic than EA executives and believes the target <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-targeting-100-million-players/">'100 million players'</a> is "<em>completely unrealstic</em>." He's also not in agreement with former Blizzard president Mike Ybarra, and doesn't think that EA's comeback with the series will be able to "<a href="https://wccftech.com/blizzard-president-battlefield-6-boot-stomp-call-of-duty-black-ops-7/"><em>boot stomp</em>" Call of Duty</a>.</p>



<p>"<em>I think it's important not to conflate Battlefield's pre-launch success - even if it will be a big success - with being a 'CoD Killer'. Yes, Battlefield 6 is making all the right moves with these massive maps, a return to the core classes, the destruction. It is also borrowing a lot of things from CoD. Call of Duty is in a bit of a creative lul and an identity crisis, with Nikki Minaj shooting Beavis and Butthead while Snoop Dogg is twerking in the background. It's weird! But it's still a cultural juggernaut, it has a massive casual audience who buy it on autopilot every year. They complain, but they still buy it, and those habits run deep.</em>"</p>



<p>"<em>Battlefield 6 is undoubtedly winning over the hardcore FPS crowd, but CoD has that market momentum, the yearly launches, Warzone is there as that big pool for cross pollination marketing and a funnel into Black Ops. CoD has the seasonal content treadmill it's been running for years and years, with streamer partnerships. Whether Battlefield can keep up with that is unclear</em>."</p>



<p>We'll see how Battlefield 6 does when it arrives this coming October, but in the meantime you can still check it out this weekend during the remainder of its open beta time. And if you're on PC and having issues getting the beta to launch due to Secure Boot errors, you can <a href="https://wccftech.com/how-to/battlefield-6-beta-how-to-enable-secure-boot/">check out our guide on how to enable Secure Boot on your PC</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
<figure><a title="Geist" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/2f0f582defdd5/geist.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>Everyone, we like to believe, has a made a secret list for every single console they've ever owned, of weird and/or experimental stuff they either want to, or wished they had, played. Sometimes you get round to them, sometimes you don't. You know the sort of thing. For me, on GameCube specifically, things like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/cubivore_survival_of_the_fittest">Cubivore</a> come to mind, and to a lesser extent <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/eternal_darkness_sanitys_requiem">Eternal Darkness</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/geist">Geist</a>. Yes, Geist! Which means "ghost" in German. Did you know that? Of course you did. Every Geisterjäger or Paranormal-Forscher worth their salz knows this stuff.</p>
<p>Now, Geist didn't exactly set the world on fire when it came out, but to skip over it for its shortcomings — of which it has its fair share — is to do yourself out of a genuinely odd, unsettling and actually quite good game. And, you know what, 20 years down the line from when it originally released, it's perhaps more intriguing than ever thanks to how differently it plays compared to many of its peers.</p><div><figure data-videoid="2FTBspZymlg" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2FTBspZymlg?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/2FTBspZymlg?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2FTBspZymlg?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed38e8b0jzrqml&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2FTBspZymlg" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>Also, Nintendo, you folks should just put it on the Switch 2, because its biggest issue was performance, and that'll sort it. Done and dusted.</p>

<p>Geist was originally released on 15th August 2005 in the US, and was developed by n-Space and published by the Big-N itself. In fact, it had the honour of being only the second M-rated game that Nintendo had published for the GameCube — I mentioned the first above (Eternal Darkness). In the game, you play as John Raimi, a boffin who's also a member of the counter-terrorist tactical team known as CR-2.</p>
<p>When a rescue goes wrong at the outset of the adventure, and a whole bunch of people die in various paranormal ways (so like a standard Tuesday night in Glasgow, basically), Raimi finds himself...well, dead, so he's a ghost now, isn't he? So, he's <em>sort of</em> dead. He has become Geist. And this is where it gets interesting, because being a ghost in a video game is exactly the sort of thing we want to spend our time doing; here, n-Space served up something that dared to be a wee bit unique. Now <em>that's</em> terrifying.</p>
<p>Even now, playing the opening of this game treats you to action set-pieces that look good in a sort of chunky-first Halo-esque way. With how badly games of this vintage tend to age in terms of visuals, I still think Geist is a bit of a looker, all things considered, and it gets underway with some nice explosions, possessions and all manner of Spooky Things™ down at the old Volks institute - where experiments of the supernatural kind are happening.</p>

<p>Luckily, Geist doesn't <em>just</em> go with big explosions and shooting things, or else we wouldn't be talking about it. N-Space decided to consider how, as a ghost, you can do many more interesting things, like possess objects and other characters in the environments which you need to puzzle through, to give us a clever and absorbing game in terms of its mechanics.</p>
<p>That's not to say there isn't any shooting at all — there's a decent amount of pew-pew here, and even some decent boss scraps along the way. Indeed, levels tend to end with a test of your reflexes in this way for the most part, so it's good the bosses aren't turgid. But Geist is much more about being a little extra creative. Whether it's taking control of something like a dog bowl in order to create a diversion, or something a little weirder like possessing a shooting game toy (just so you can then play it), or heck, even soda cans have their uses, it's a blast, and it gets you thinking a bit.</p>
<p>Human enemies with special abilities or weapons can be targeted so as to make your way past obstacles and environmental puzzles; a grenade goon will enable you to blow stuff up, an engineer will be useful to clear paths and so on. Before you haunt a human, though, you'll need to scare the bejesus out of them to make them open to the process...so to speak. This is where your loud bangs, noises, and ability to possess beds so you can raise up like a Scooby Doo ghost out of them, comes in handy. The game goes surprisingly deep with this stuff; you can even take out guards by poisoning them, if you know who's cooking their food.</p>

<p>Add to this the usual gamut of security cameras, computers and things of this nature to take over, and you've got a lovely little playground to muck around in, complete with a novel approach to puzzling and a story that, whilst you're definitely not going to be thinking about it afterwards, does its job in keeping you hooked until the reason behind the entire incident that's turned you into a floating mischief-maker is unveiled.</p>
<p>If there's one place where Geist falls down fairly hard, it's the performance. It's a clunky old beast overall, and the frame-rate is pretty inconsistent. The controls, too, whilst fine overall, annoy somewhat with a sluggish camera speed with no way to change it!</p>
<p>However, with a fun multiplayer mode that sees up to 4-players engage in three ghost-based modes, and a campaign you can whip through in about seven hours max, Geist is still a game that I look back on with much fondness, and one of those hidden gems that actually lives up to the name. Stick this on without knowing much about it, and 2005 you was in for quite the treat. You still will be today.</p>
<p>Now, go on and put it on NSO so I can get our fancy new GameCube controllers out and start haunting faucets again. Do it.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>The state of Louisiana has filed a lawsuit against Roblox, alleging that the company has “permitted and perpetuated an online environment in which child predators thrive, directly contributing to the widespread victimization of minor children in Louisiana.”</p><p>Roblox sees more than 111.8 million daily active users, and it’s hugely popular with children, with users under 13 comprising nearly 40 percent of players last quarter. However, the platform has come under significant scrutiny over reported failures to protect children on the platform, with <em>Bloomberg</em> publishing a major report last year <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/features/2024-roblox-pedophile-problem/?srnd=undefined">about predators on Roblox</a> and the investment firm Hindenburg Research alleging that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/8/24265145/roblox-hindenburg-reseach-dau-child-safety-short-seller-report">its research revealed</a> “an X-rated pedophile hellscape.” In recent months, Roblox has taken steps to bolster its child safety features, including introducing <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/23/24277992/roblox-pre-teen-children-parent-accounts-default-settings">parent accounts</a> that can manage their child’s account and the ability for parents <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/641167/roblox-parental-controls-block-friends-experiences">to block people on their child’s friend list</a>.</p><p>But Louisiana alleges that Roblox’s “deliberate failure to implement effective safety measures to protect child users from well-documented predatory threats, along with its ongoing failure to warn parents and children of the foreseeable dangers posed by its platform, has directly facilitated the widespread sexual exploitation of minors and inflicted severe, lasting harm upon the children of Louisiana,” according to the complaint.</p><p>“Roblox is overrun with harmful content and child predators because it prioritizes user growth, revenue, and profits over child safety,” <a href="https://www.ag.state.la.us/Article/322">Attorney General Liz Murrill says</a>. “Every parent should be aware of the clear and present danger poised to their children by Roblox so they can prevent the unthinkable from ever happening in their own home.”</p><p>Roblox spokesperson Kadia Koroma sent the following statement about the lawsuit to <em>The Verge</em>:</p><div><blockquote><p>The assertion that Roblox would intentionally put our users at risk of exploitation is categorically untrue. Every day, tens of millions of people around the world use Roblox to learn stem skills, play, and imagine and have a safe experience on our platform. We dedicate vast resources to supporting a safe infrastructure including advanced technology and 24/7 human moderation, to detect and prevent inappropriate content and behavior — not only because it’s important to us but because it is such a critical issue and so important to our community. We dispute these allegations and we remain committed to working with Attorney General Murrill to keep kids safe.</p><p>While no system is perfect, Roblox has implemented rigorous safeguards—such as restrictions on sharing personal information, links, and user-to-user image sharing—to help protect our community. Unfortunately, bad actors will try to circumvent our systems to try to direct users off the platform, where safety standards and moderation practices may differ. We continuously work to block those efforts and to enhance our moderation approaches to promote a safe and enjoyable environment for all users.</p></blockquote></div><div><p>The company also published an <a href="https://corp.roblox.com/newsroom/2025/08/roblox-responds-to-louisiana-ag-lawsuit">article responding to the lawsuit</a> on its newsroom.</p></div><p>Seven lawsuits regarding child predator issues have been filed against Roblox in a “little over two weeks,” <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-08-15/roblox-shares-fall-after-louisiana-attorney-general-files-suit?srnd=homepage-americas"><em>Bloomberg</em> reports</a>.</p><p>This week, Roblox published <a href="https://corp.roblox.com/newsroom/2025/08/more-on-removal-of-vigilantes-from-roblox">a post on its website</a> about why it removes what it describes as “vigilantes” who try to catch bad actors on Roblox by using tactics “similar to actual predators.” One user, who goes by “Schlep” and says on <a href="https://x.com/RealSchlep">his X profile</a> that he has contributed to “6 Roblox arrests and counting,” posted screenshots <a href="https://x.com/RealSchlep/status/1954255952997478537">on X</a> last week of what he says was a cease-and-desist notice by Roblox.</p><p><em><strong>Update, August 15th</strong>: Added statement from Roblox.</em></p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTIz"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Jay Peters</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/760162/roblox-louisiana-lawsuit-child-predators-safety]]></content:encoded>

<p>The Remedy Connected Universe is growing pretty rapidly these days, and its latest entry is a <i>Control</i> spin-off known as <i>FBC: Firebreak</i>. In this cooperative shooter, players return to the Federal Bureau of Control’s bizarre and unsettling Oldest House with up to two pals.</p> <p><b>Read More: </b><a href="https://kotaku.com/fbc-firebreak-relaunch-remedy-alan-wake-control-2000617135"><i>Alan Wake</i> Devs Plan A Big Relaunch For Failing Co-Op Flop</a></p> <p>Unfortunately, the game hasn’t been the hit many were probably hoping for. Developer Remedy is looking to put some elbow grease into <a href="https://kotaku.com/fbc-firebreak-relaunch-remedy-alan-wake-control-2000617135">rehabilitating the co-op shooter</a>. But you <i>can</i> play it right now if you want. So let’s get into everything you’d need to know if you want to play it as of summer 2025.</p> <h2><span id="what-don%e2%80%99t-folks-like-about-fbc-firebreak"></span>What don’t folks like about <i>FBC: Firebreak</i>?<span></span></h2> <p><i>Firebreak</i> unfortunately hasn’t satisfied critics or players. Cited issues include a “<a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/reviews/ps5/fbc-firebreak">lifeless</a>” feeling when playing and a bit too much <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fbc-firebreak-review">chaos and drudgery</a>. It’s a disappointing debut for a game set in an otherwise excellent setting with a decent premise.</p>

 <h2><span id="how-many-people-are-playing-right-now"></span>How many people are playing right now?<span></span></h2> <p>While you may be able to make your own fun in <i>Firebreak</i>, it’s fair to say most people aren’t. At the time of this writing, <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2272540/charts/">SteamDB reports</a> a player count in the low teens, with an all-time peak of 1,992 players. Those aren’t great numbers on PC, to say the least.</p> <h2><span id="does-fbc-firebreak-have-crossplay-support"></span>Does <i>FBC: Firebreak</i> have crossplay support?<span></span></h2> <p>The short answer is <b>yes</b>, <b><i>FBC: Firebreak</i></b><b> has crossplay support</b>. Players can team with one another across other platforms by sharing a party code. So, if you’re a console fan with friends who prefer to play on PC, or vice versa, you can invite each other for some first-person shooting fun in either duos or trios.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000618048" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000618048"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000618048">© Screenshot: Remedy</figcaption></figure> <h2><span id="does-fbc-firebreak-have-crossprogression-support"></span>Does <i>FBC: Firebreak</i> have cross-progression support?<span></span></h2> <p>The good news stops at crossplay, I’m afraid. <b><i>FBC: Firebreak</i></b><b> does not support cross-progression at launch</b>.</p> <p>However, that doesn’t mean the game won’t have cross-progression at some point in the future.</p>

 <p>Speaking to <a href="https://mp1st.com/news/fbc-firebreak-crossplay-support-launch-no-cross-progression">MP1ST</a>, community manager Julian Fondum responded to an inquiry about cross-progression by saying, “Not at launch. Maybe way down the line. It’s a maybe. A lot of things we’re doing on the back end [are] definitely built in the way that we can do a bunch of things down the line when we have more resources and so on.”</p> <p>That sounds promising to me! But as with any feature that hasn’t been confirmed yet, don’t hold your breath. I suspect there are plenty of things on the game’s roadmap that Remedy views as more pivotal for the game than this for now.</p> <p>If you’re a fan of the Remedy Connected Universe and want to see what all the fuss is about, even if the game has failed to impress on launch, <i>FBC: Firebreak</i> is available now on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series S/X, and Windows PCs.</p>
