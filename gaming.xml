            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>

<p>If you're into cosy games with crafting, farming, and the like, but <em>also</em> like driving around in an open world, Dutch studio Square Glade Games has announced that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/outbound">Outbound</a> is coming to Switch 2.</p>
<p>Previously announced for the original Switch (don't worry, it's still coming to that console if you're a Switch 1 faithful), the game was a Kickstarter success back in 2024, raising a chunky €265,679 to bring Outbound to PC and consoles in <strong>Q2 2026</strong>, and that now includes Switch 2.</p>
<p>The trailer above will give you a good idea of the gameplay blend the small team is working up, but it looks to be combining elements of open-world exploration (co-op with up to three other players if you want) with campervan decoration, crafting, farming, cooking, patting the dog - all the cosy things you might want wrapped up in a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/firewatch">Firewatch</a>-esque art style.</p>
<p>The Kickstarter broke every stretch goal going, so you've also got fishing, beekeeping, other minigames, and a character editor. Here's the offical blurb and feature rundown, plus a bunch of screenshots showcasing the breadth of options available, not to mention the incredible breadth of your camper's roof that allows for all that customisation:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Outbound is an open-world exploration game set in a utopian near future. Start with an empty camper van and turn it into the home of your dreams - alone or together with your friends. Build and explore at your own pace. Scavenge materials, craft, and build in and on top of your vehicle with modular parts. Advance in technology and efficiently use energy to power your home. Adjust your playstyle to adapt to new landscapes and changing environmental conditions.<br>
<strong>Source Energy<br></strong>Power your electric camper van with energy from the sun, wind, or water.<br>
<strong>Build<br></strong>Build your moving base with a modular building system. Customize your vehicle with paint, decorations, and furniture to create your own perfect cozy place.<br>
<strong>Craft<br></strong>Craft workstations and tools from resources provided by Mother Nature. Research advanced technology to refine and combine them into new materials.<br>
<strong>Grow<br></strong>Create gardens to nurture delicate and delicious plants and mushrooms. Eat them raw or cook delicious meals to refill your needs.<br>
<strong>Play together<br></strong>Explore a colorful open world with a variety of biomes, resources, and secrets, together with your friends. Play Outbound alone or with up to 4 players cooperatively.</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>"A utopian near future..." Yep, we'll have a drop of that, please.</p>
<p>The Kickstarter page still has an estimated delivery date of January 2026, but Q2 2026 is the official word at the moment. Given the ambition (we particularly like the sound of the four-player co-op) of this two-person team indie endeavour, we'll be impressed if it doesn't slip a little.</p>
<p><em>See? Not a single mention of BOTW visual vibes. Let us know below if you like the look of Outbound and plan on getting away from it all sometime in the first half of 2026.</em></p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/outbound-brings-campervan-crafting-and-open-world-road-trips-to-switch-2-next-year]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-review-switch-2-bugs-performance-2000637719"><i><span>Pokémon Legends: Z-A’s</span></i></a> <i><span>Mega Dimension </span></i><span>DLC is just a few weeks away, and it’s bringing a handful of new <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-mega-evolutions-best-worst-designs-legends-z-a-2000625459">Mega Evolutions</a>, a <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-mega-dimension-dlc-level-cap-100-2000641765">roguelike mode</a>, and additional story to the Nintendo Switch RPG. Today, Game Freak announced that Zeraora, one of the rare mythical Pokémon from Generation VI, is getting its own Mega Evolution in the DLC with a new trailer, and it sure does sound like the <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-mega-dimension-dlc-new-evolutions-2000641670">datamined list of new Megas is completely legit</a>.</span></p> <p><span>The trailer is brief, but shows the </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A </span></i><span>protagonist running around and fighting hostile Pokémon in a weird bizarro version of Lumiose City with Zeraora by their side. Just as the pair seems about to be overwhelmed, Zeraora mega evolves and manages to win the fight:</span></p>

  <p><em>Legends: Z-A</em>‘s Mega Evolutions have been so lopsided in terms of the goofy/cool ratio that it’s kind of refreshing to see Mega Zeraora is a super edgy, overdesigned electric cat boy. It’s straightforward and has that “middle schooler’s notebook doodle” design philosophy that is pretty prominent in a lot of the original Mega Evolution designs from <em>Pokémon X </em>and&nbsp;<em>Y</em>. I like the silly designs like Mega Victreebell and Slowbro, but we need some cool cats in the mix, too.</p>

 <p>Zeraora is one of several leaked Mega Evolutions dataminers found in <em>Legends: Z-A</em>‘s code, and thus far, every new form Game Freak has revealed for <em>Mega Dimension&nbsp;</em>has been on that list. We knew Raichu was getting two forms, then Baxcalibur and Chimecho were <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-mega-dimension-dlc-new-raichu-2000641644">revealed in the DLC’s first gameplay trailer</a>, so we’re just waiting for the rest of the list at this point.</p> <p>Some of the new Mega Evolutions will apparently include new forms for Pokémon who have already received Megas in the past, including Lucario, Absol, and Garchomp. At the moment, it’s unclear if those forms will have the same “X” or “Y” naming convention of other Pokémon who have gotten multiple Mega forms, including Raichu, Charizard, and Mewtwo, so fans have taken to calling them “Z” forms.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/if-you-own-an-iphone-amazon-gives-you-2-free-airtags-for-black-friday-2000645425</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/if-you-own-an-iphone-amazon-gives-you-2-free-airtags-for-black-friday.1357972/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Losing keys and wallets is a source of stress that tracking devices solve by locating the exact position through your phone. Individual (Apple) AirTags sell for $29 apiece which puts two units at around $60 before you add in Apple’s usual premium.</p>
<p>Amazon’s deal for Black Friday flips this math on its<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3844/"> head by offering a four-pack for $64, down from the regular $99 price</a>. You’re basically<strong> paying for two AirTags at full price and getting two additional units as bonus freebies</strong>. This all-time low pricing makes stocking up on trackers for every item you frequently misplace finally affordable, and for iPhone users, it means access to Apple’s <em>Find My</em> network.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3844/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Precision Tracking via Apple’s Vast Network</h2>
<p>AirTags use the<strong> more-than-a-billion-strong Find My network of Apple devices worldwide</strong>, crowdsourcing locations even when items move beyond your Bluetooth range. Any passing iPhone, iPad, or Mac picks up your AirTag’s encrypted signal and relays its location anonymously back to your account without the intermediary device owner ever knowing. This network effect works great in cities where Apple devices are everywhere and provides near real-time updates as your lost item moves through populated spaces.</p>
<p>Precision Finding allows the iPhone 11 and newer to display directional arrows and distance measurements and leads you directly to where lost items are located. Ultra-wideband technology calculates the precise spatial positioning to show you which direction to walk and how many feet remain. The capability turns vague searches like “somewhere in this room” into guided treasure hunts leading you to the couch cushion holding your keys.</p>



<p>The built-in speaker plays sounds when you activate the Find My app which can help you find items buried under papers on your desk or tucked in jacket pockets you might have forgotten to check. The speaker volume gets loud enough to be heard from adjacent rooms, though thick materials like couch cushions muffle it significantly. You can also trigger the speaker when an AirTag separates from your iPhone beyond a certain distance and warns you that you’ve left something behind before you drive away or hop on a train.</p>
<p><strong>Battery life is around a year on the user-replaceable CR2032 coin cell battery</strong> which is a standard size available for a few bucks at grocery stores and gas stations. That replaceable design means you’re not tossing the entire tracker when power runs out, unlike sealed competitors that’ll become e-waste when their batteries eventually die.</p>



<p><strong>Water and dust resistance rated at IP67 lets AirTags survive splashes, rain, and brief submersion</strong> up to one meter for 30 minutes. The sealed construction protects internal components from pocket lint, dirt, and the general abuse that small accessories endure.</p>
<p>With four AirTags costing just $64, when singles are $29 apiece, you’re essentially getting $116 worth of trackers for barely more than the price of buying two units separately. The $35 discount and underlying buy-two-get-two-free math makes this four-pack the only sensible purchase option for iPhone users needing to track multiple items.</p>

  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p>On Monday, Hypixel co-founder Simon Collins-Laflamme revealed the good news that he'd followed through on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hytale-studio-founder-says-hell-reach-out-to-riot-in-an-effort-to-buy-back-and-revive-the-game">saying he'd chat</a> to Riot Games about buying the rights to the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/minecraft">Minecraft</a>y sandbox game <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hytale">Hytale</a> by <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/in-a-rare-bit-of-good-news-hytale-lives-on-with-its-original-devs-buying-the-rights-off-of-riot">buying the rights</a> to said game. Now, with an independent team back working on the game following the closure of its<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/minecrafty-sandbox-game-hytale-cancelled-after-a-decade-in-development-as-hypixel-studios-prepare-to-close">original studio</a>, Collins-Laflamme and co have shared a 16 minute look at what Hytale's currently like to play.</p>

<p>The snippet shows off some exploring and enemy battling, with the game's world in its survival-esque exploration mode currently looking straightforwardly hostile and dungeon crawly. You run around, you collect materials by hitting things, then you hit the likes of skeletons before they hit you. The biomes look nicely varied and visually interesting given where the game's at right now, especially when the light fades, allowing certain fauna or weather effects to coat the area in an atmospheric coloured glow. The combat and climbing animations also look very fluid and snazzy.</p>
<p>"I promised players videos, screenshots and blog posts," Collins-Laflamme wrote in the video's description. "One day after the acquisition, I’m keeping that promise. Now that you’ve seen the first gameplay footage in a long time, I’m heading back to work on the early access launch. The team will share more clips and screenshots as we go. It mattered to me to release raw footage today so we break the curse once and for all. Stay tuned, Cursebreakers. More is coming."</p><p>According to that same description, this snippet is "the original legacy engine from the 2018 trailer, running on a four-year-old build as we push Hytale forward again", and was "recorded in a single morning and put together by Collins-Laflamme. "No bells or whistles," the blurb adds. "Just the game as it is. Raw and broken, but still beautiful."</p>
<p>As you might expect given this showcase has come so soon after the announcement of Hytale changing hands, there's no fresh update on when its promised early access launch is due or how much it'll cost you to grab. Though, Collins-Laflamme's been clear the team plan to show off more of the game and has delivered on that right out of the gate, so for now there seems no reason to doubt your patience in giving the devs time to finalise those key details won't be rewarded soon.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/dyson-quietly-unloads-its-185aw-vacuum-stick-on-amazon-now-cheaper-than-no-name-vacuums-2000645366</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dyson-quietly-unloads-its-185aw-vacuum-stick-on-amazon-now-cheaper-than-no-name-vacuums.1357870/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Dyson built its reputation by staying away from Black Friday discounts and maintaining premium pricing year-round. That strategy ends this year as the brand drops record-low prices across its lineup on Amazon and signals a major shift in how they approach holiday sales: The <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4478/">V11 Origin now sells for $399, down from its regular $629 price tag (nearly 40% off)</a> and puts modern Dyson technology within reach of shoppers who previously settled for cheaper alternatives. You’ll also find the older V9 at $269, but that model dates back to 2016 with significantly weaker suction and outdated battery technology.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4478/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Power and Intelligence</h2>
<p>The <strong>V11 sends 185 air watts through its motor</strong> which provide 60% more suction than previous Dyson generations and beats most corded vacuums in debris pickup tests. This power amounts to the ability to clean both hard floors and carpets in single passes, eliminating the need for repeated cleaning of the same spots. The Motorbar cleaner head employs counter-rotating bristles that dig deep into carpet fibers while maintaining contact with hard surfaces, adapting automatically as you move room to room. <strong>Anti-tangle technology</strong> inside the brush bar keeps hair from wrapping around the roller.</p>
<p>Three modes of power give you control over suction intensity and battery life, depending on what you’re cleaning. Auto mode utilizes onboard sensors to detect floor type and dynamically adjust power for a balance of performance and runtime, extending battery life during everyday tasks. <strong>Eco mode dials back suction for light cleaning jobs and maximum runtime</strong>, stretching<strong> battery life up to 60 minutes</strong> for whole-home sessions. Boost mode unleashes full power for stubborn dirt in high-traffic areas or deep carpet cleaning, though it drains the battery faster at roughly five minutes of intensive use.</p>



<p>Real-time information is <strong>displayed on an LCD screen</strong> mounted on the body, something older cordless vacuums lack, showing remaining runtime counted down to the second. You will know just how much time remains for cleaning before you have to recharge, and you won’t have to deal with the annoying mid-room battery deaths. The screen will also alert you when maintenance is required, such as filter cleaning or blockage detection.</p>



<p>You can also <strong>convert it to handheld mode in a matter of seconds</strong> by detaching the wand and attaching tools directly into the motor body. This setup is ideal for car interiors, upholstered furniture and stairs where the full stick format becomes too unwieldy. The hair screw tool that comes with this vacuum has a conical brush bar designed especially for picking up pet hair on furniture, while the crevice tool reaches into tight gaps along baseboards and between cushions.</p>
<p><strong>HEPA filtration captures 99.97% of particles as small as 0.3 microns</strong>, and traps allergens and fine dust that lesser vacuums blow back into your air. The sealed system ensures that dirty air passes through the filter before exiting, making the V11 suitable for allergy sufferers who need cleaner air as much as cleaner floors. The bagless design includes a bin that you empty with a single button press, with no ongoing costs for replacement bags.</p>
<p>At $399 for a vacuum packing 185AW, you’re getting Dyson’s current engineering for less than many inferior stick vacuums cost at full price. $230 off means this is the first time the V11 has dipped below $400 and undercuts even generic mid-range models that lack the power, battery life and smart features.</p>

Here’s the official blurb, as it was back then:</p><blockquote>Hytale combines the scope of a sandbox with the depth of a roleplaying game, immersing players in a procedurally generated world where teetering towers and deep dungeons promise rich rewards throughout their adventures. Hytale supports everything from block-by-block construction to scripting and minigame creation, delivered using easy to use and powerful tools.</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">Excitement around Hytale was fueled by the experience of the developers themselves, who co-founded Hypixel, one of the most influential Minecraft servers in the world. Riot invested in the project and eventually bought the studio.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Vikki Blake is a reporter for IGN, as well as a critic, columnist, and consultant with 15+ years experience working with some of the world's biggest gaming sites and publications.

        <p>"It's a battlefield. There's no two ways about it."</p>

  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Former Xbox boss Peter Moore has recalled why Microsoft poached him from Sega to head-up the company's Xbox 360 charge. He had experience launching the Dreamcast, yes, but more alluring seemed to be his experience of being part of Sega's battle in a console war. Microsoft needed someone to take the fight to Sony and PlayStation.</p>
<p>"Look, I'm not a self-described nerd," <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-was-afraid-sony-was-going-to-own-the-living-room-the-big-xbox-360-interview-part-1">Peter Moore told me as part of a larger interview</a>, part-one of which you can read now. "And Microsoft was very much a company that was seen as guys with pocket protectors and thick glasses.</p>
<p>"We needed to bring in different people that could stand on stage and throw punches at Sony and be a little bit more aggressive in a different way, and had experience of taking on the PlayStation, which I did, obviously, during my Sega days. So I was not the stereotypical quintessential Microsoft employee. I was brought in to create strategy, lead on stage from the front, be a little irreverent, maybe get a tattoo or two... I was brought in to be part of a very talented team and, like I say, to start throwing punches."</p>

<p>Remember, Moore was well trained in this aspect. He'd spent years heading up Reebok and battling sports giant Nike before he moved to Sega, so he knew how to scrap for market share. As he explained to me: "There's only 100 percent market share, and so the fight you have is to win hearts and minds. And it's a battlefield. There's no two ways about it."</p><p>This console war we feel the echoes of now, then, between PlayStation and Xbox - it was in some way deliberately stoked and perpetuated by Peter Moore and Microsoft. "This became the console wars," he said, "where we, Microsoft, were coming from a position of newcomer and nerdy and not an entertainment brand, and we needed to build a separate brand called Xbox that would not only make hardware but software and services."</p>
<p>Xbox being separate from Microsoft was a key distinction they needed to make. It's why any mention of Microsoft's name tends to be nowhere near anything related to Xbox. "Not be ashamed of being part of Microsoft," Moore said, "but if you look at the packaging, and you look at our marketing and everything we were doing during that time: sure, if you looked hard, 'Microsoft' was there, but it was really building a brand that would be sustainable for decades to come. And as we sit here today, in 2025, we did."</p>

<p>During Moore's four-year tenure, Xbox gained significant ground on PlayStation, and inked historical deals such as securing Grand Theft Auto 4 for simultaneous Xbox 360 release - a deal Moore announced by revealing a GTA 4 tattoo on his arm during a press conference. Xbox also launched powerful brands that it's still milking today, such as Gears of War and Forza, as well as a host of iconic third-party games.</p>
<p>But this aggression and rivalry doesn't seem to be a part of Microsoft's strategy today, which has famously adapted to include <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-mascot-and-long-time-microsoft-exclusive-halo-is-coming-to-ps5-for-the-very-first-time-this-is-halo-for-everyone">publishing games on PlayStation hardware, including Xbox's flagship brand Halo</a>. It's partially a concession to PlayStation 5's dominance, and a move that would have been unheard of during Moore's tenure, I'm sure.</p><p>"Does there need to be a winner?" he responded when I asked what he thought of Xbox's position today. "If there's somebody ahead, is the other guy a loser? We're a $200 billion industry this year. If you define somebody as leading and somebody second, that company in second place is probably doing billions of dollars worth of business.</p>
<p>"And in the case of Microsoft, is having a place in gaming and a brand like Xbox and delivering entertainment experiences: does that somehow put - no pun intended - a halo around the broader Xbox? Go look at Microsoft's stock price. Go look at what Microsoft has done since I left, and Bill left. I'd like to think Xbox was a little piece of the success that you now have with Microsoft."</p>

<p>Well, here's another port that we weren't expecting. Despite teeing off on other systems back in February, 2K Sports has today announced that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pga-tour-2k25">PGA TOUR 2K25</a> will also be swinging onto Switch 2 at some point in the future.</p>
<p>Yep, we were a little vague about a release date there, and it was completely intentional. We know that the latest PGA Tour entry is coming our way <em>sometime</em> down the line, but we have no specifics on when, just yet.</p>
<p>But hey, it's exciting news. The Switch 2 version will support all of the game modes you can find on other systems, including MyCAREER, cross-platform online Societies, a Course Designer and more. The latest entry in 2K's golf series packs all kinds of fancy new swing tech, with EvoSwing or Perfect Swing options for veterans and newbies alike, and there's also the chance to play in Major Championship venues, Quail Hollow Club, Oakmont Country Club, and Royal Portrush Golf Club for the first time in series history.</p>

            <p>Microsoft have delivered a timely reminder that AI isn’t just effective at injecting ugly, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/arc-raiders-review">soulless</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/we-need-to-reclaim-softwares-wishing-well-from-the-cruelty-of-generative-ai">anti-art</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/where-winds-meet-player-convinces-one-of-the-games-npcs-theyre-pregnant-with-his-baby">nonsense robochat</a> into your games – it also has the power to ruin your entire PC.</p>
<p>MS recently <a href="https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/experimental-agentic-features-a25ede8a-e4c2-4841-85a8-44839191dfb3">updated a support article</a> explaining the 'agentic AI' features they plan to roll out for Windows 11, which involve creating a separate desktop instance and allowing AI 'agents' to perform supposedly menial tasks (like file sorting and email sending) within it. All while you kick back on your main workspace, online shopping for the third yacht that the AI revolution has surely enabled you to afford. Unfortunately, among the agents’ capabilities is the risk of installing malware.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Specifically, the article warns that agentic AI may "introduce novel security risks, such as cross-prompt injection (XPIA), where malicious content embedded in UI elements or documents can override agent instructions, leading to unintended actions like data exfiltration or malware installation.” Sounds awful. Terrible! Clearly not the kind of vulnerability that Microsoft could possibly allow to stand and oh no wait they’re going through with it anyway, with the first experimental versions already being live via the Windows Insider programme.</p>
<p>There are token safeguards: the 'agent workspace' is disabled by default, and can only be enabled by someone with admin privileges. But it’s hardly reassuring when the only way to use these features safely is to <em>not</em> use them, at all. And you would stay at effectively zero risk of XPIA attacks if you didn't, as these types of malware are engineered to <a href="https://www.ibm.com/think/topics/prompt-injection">target large language models</a> (LLMs) rather than humans.</p><p>It’s likely inevitable that Windows 11 will swell up with agentic AI at some point; Microsoft have been talking about it for months, and with Windows 10 having <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/nearly-a-third-of-all-gaming-pcs-are-still-running-windows-10-even-as-microsoft-prepare-to-kill-it">lost (of all things) its security updates</a>, it’s not like fleeing to the older OS is a long-term alternative. But putting it in users’ hands when the AI involved hasn’t been sufficiently trained to avoid obvious, often plain-English phishing or malware injection scams is <em>spectacular</em> arrogance. Unless it’s some kind of Valve inside job to make us all buy SteamOS-powered <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hands-on-with-the-new-steam-machine-valves-square-shot-at-steamos-pc-redemption">Steam Machines</a>, but I’m not sure their wheelie desks would roll that far.</p>
<p>Motoring critics often use the phrase "Car Brain" to illustrate how otherwise rational, sensible drivers suddenly lose their empathy and perception functions as soon as they sit behind a steering wheel. I’d like to propose the usage of "AI Brain" to describe the phenomena of ostensibly intelligent technologists instantly abandoning any sense of responsibility, creativity, good product design, and in many cases, basic human decency the minute they have artificial intelligence in front of their face. AI Brain can be easily identified through symptoms such as excessive LinkedIn posting and the vocalisation of gibberish about how their company <em>needs</em> to steal other people’s work, actually.</p>
