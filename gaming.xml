            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/fractured-blooms-makes-me-feel-uncomfortable-and-i-dont-even-know-what-its-about<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A chilling surprise from the Summer Game Fest showcase last week was the reveal of Serenity Forge's new game, <a href="https://serenityforge.com/games/fractured-blooms" rel="nofollow"><em>Fractured Blooms</em></a>. Inspired by a true story, the trailer opens on a cosy cottage, before layered whispering and warping of the music begins to give away a more… horrific nature to this story.</p>

<p>At Summer Game Fest, I got to play a demo of <em>Fractured Blooms</em> at an event called The MIX, where indie developers from all over were able to showcase what they were working on.</p>

<p><em>Fractured Blooms</em> markets itself as a psychological life sim where you "Play as Angie, a girl who finds herself stuck in a time loop and a world that is soft and still."</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/fractured-blooms-sgf-2025-gardening.jpg?itok=F8Tgdr5F 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/fractured-blooms-sgf-2025-gardening.jpg?itok=qprpqrqF 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h2>A Farming Simulation?</h2>

<p>Beginning the game, I walked up a path to a pretty house, with an even prettier garden. As you walk, Angie begins to narrate. She talks of the importance of raising the crops, and each step along the way, her narration lends itself to what you should do next.</p>

<p>Visit the garden, pluck a Tomato, place the Tomato in a basket, sow some beet seeds, water them, and then make your way inside to cook dinner.</p>

<p>All the while, you're completing simple tasks, and your stamina in the lower left of the screen slowly ticks away. The narration is simple enough, but as you'd expect from the voice of any little girl whispering in your ear, it's a little unsettling.</p>

<p>Cooking is when things began to go awry. Making sure to chop up the tomato, grab some herbs and meat, put it in a pot and let it cook for 30 seconds was slow and eerie enough, but when strange things began to happen like odd noises from the radio I was on edge.</p>

<p>Heading upstairs, a timer appeared on the screen for Angie to go to sleep, but first, I needed to gather the dirty laundry from the various rooms on the top floor. I would like to say that I was excellent at this, identifying all of the laundry and getting it in the machine well before the timer hit zero, but that just wasn't the case.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/fractured-blooms-sgf-2025-timer.jpg?itok=sjfj6tAP 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/fractured-blooms-sgf-2025-timer.jpg?itok=ry9E4EAr 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h2>Deeper Secrets Of The House And It's Inhabitants</h2>

<p>Each of the rooms lent to a larger story, coded as if a boy or girl might be living there, and in the main bedroom, there was what I can only describe as the breakdown of reality glowing red and pixelated in the corner. For a house that only Angie is currently living in… there's far more to this story.</p>

<p>Going to bed, well after the timer had hit zero, Angie woke up the next morning, pulling apart reality and starting from the bottom of the hill as I had initially started the demo. This time, as I approached the house, it was far less cute…</p>

<p>A number of changes had taken place. Sinister red plants were growing all over, the sky was darker, and for failing to put away my laundry in time and getting to bed I was starting the day with one less stamina.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/fractured-blooms-sgf-2025-04.jpg?itok=Zcf5lkxH 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/fractured-blooms-sgf-2025-04.jpg?itok=YkKyKq8j 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Repeating the tasks from the day everything got that much more sinister. While watering the plants they grew in disfiguring ways, while cooking the TV turned on to static and the remote had been thrown half-way across the room, when I walked upstairs I was prepared to load the laundry as soon as possible. <em>Fractured Blooms</em> had other intentions though as it forced me to hide from… something, or hallways became impassable as red roots grew out of the walls.</p>

<p>I didn't load the laundry in time… I went to sleep tired again, fearing the effect on the next day, and almost thankfully, the demo ended.</p>

<p>I stepped away from <em>Fractured Blooms,</em> perplexed. I'm normally quite quick to pick up on a game, and have at least some idea of a direction it's heading. Impressively, all I came away from <em>Fractured Blooms</em> with was doubts and questions.</p>

<p>I wanted to know what could have been different if I had been more successful on the first day? What happened if I planted flowers instead of beets like the narration requested? Where was everyone else from the house, and if what Angie was seeing was real (including the warping portal in her bedroom) then what was the cause of it?</p>

<p>It also didn't help that I was greeted at the end of the demo by Z, the founder of Serenity Forge, who was interested to learn what I thought the game was about. I tried my best to piece together initial thoughts that it was a game about a warring childlike psyche and the negative impacts of the world around it, but that I didn't even have initial guesses about what the story of the house and it's inhabitants were.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/fractured-blooms-sgf-2025-gun.jpg?itok=bOMm4Qfk 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/fractured-blooms-sgf-2025-gun.jpg?itok=XCklIV9m 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The very fact that you get a gun at some point just reinforces that I am not aware of what's going on here...</figcaption></figure><p>The amount of time spent in the demo was just enough to pique my interest and now I want to go back in and explore every depth of the full game. Maybe it's just me feeling bitter that I was so confidant about planning a laundry route on the second go around and the game humbled me so intensely?</p>

<h2><em>Fractured Blooms</em> Preview | Final Thoughts</h2>

<p><em>Fractured Blooms</em> has all of the makings to be an incredible hit. A relatively smaller scoped world, jam packed with iteration changes, and a deeper story to learn about Angie and her view of the world.</p>

<p>Mechanics are simple enough for anyone to approach, but in order to best manage your resources and the punches that the world is going to throw at you it will demand quick thinking.</p>

<p>I look forward to learning not just how much deeper the story goes, but also the mechanics of growing crops in your garden, gathering them, and preparing meals for yourself, and I truly feel for whoever's story this is inspired by…</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/ronin-rpg-review-honor-and-chaos<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Welcome to the eternal twilight. Death and horror can be found here in abundance, and you won't have to look far. But there's something different about you. The darkness doesn't like you, or what you represent. A small speck of light. A shred of honor. You won't last long. They never do.</em></p>

<p>The <em>Ronin</em> tabletop RPG by Slightly Reckless Games is set on the fictional island of Kage No Shima, in a feudal Japanese setting. The world is under a never-ending eclipse, and the terrors of the night, drawn from myths and legends, have come to take hold. <em>Ronin</em> uses the <em>Mork Borg</em> third-party license and&nbsp;was a successful Kickstarter back in 2023. SRG's latest Kickstarter,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/slightlyreckless/ronin-densetsu" rel="nofollow">Rōnin: Densetsu</a><em>,</em> has just funded successfully, adding new accessories and supplements to the game, and for those that missed it, the pledge manager&nbsp;is planned to open on June 13.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/ronin-rpg-2.jpg?itok=WigAfNtf 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/ronin-rpg-2.jpg?itok=JtEhjuf2 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Ronin</em> is full of art, and each page blends the artwork into the rules or background it presents [Credit - <em>Ronin</em> Rulebook, Slightly Reckless Games].</figcaption></figure><h2>Honor In The Darkness</h2>

<p><em>Ronin</em> uses the <em>Mork Borg</em> third-party license for its rules, which means that the rules for playing are similar, so anyone who's played <em>Mork Borg</em> will pick this up quickly. However, it is also its own entire game, so anyone who hasn't played <em>Mork Borg</em>&nbsp;will still find everything they need here to play. The&nbsp;<em>Ronin</em>&nbsp;rulebook is also as dark and beautifully chaotic as <em>Mork Borg</em>. A never-ending eclipse has darkened the world, bringing madness and terrors with it, and the chaos of the book layout reflects that.</p>

<p>This chaotic layout doesn't reflect the efficiency of how it gets the information across, quite the opposite. The punchy digest-sized <em>Ronin</em> hardcover (or 128-page PDF if you're digitally inclined) delivers the background lore of the setting, details the island of Kage No Shima and its locations, and the main factions that inhabit it, in its punchy first few pages.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/ronin-rpg-6.jpg?itok=Wv9UODyc 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/ronin-rpg-6.jpg?itok=68N43SQy 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Character death is a part of <em>Ronin</em>, and blends seamlessly into the setting and mechanics&nbsp;[Credit - <a href="https://slightlyrecklessgames.com/pages/free-stuff-ronin" rel="nofollow">Slightly Reckless Games website</a>].</figcaption></figure><h2>Way Of The Sword</h2>

<p>The <em>Ronin</em> rules are as light as the background, even for a rules-lite system. There's a single page on tests, essentially just a paragraph saying roll a D20 and add your stat vs the difficulty rating. A couple of pages cover combat, which is also kept super punchy, with the players making a roll for defense when they're attacked, no roll from the GM required. On their turn, there are a couple of attack options, a once-per-combat parry option, and details for fumbles and critical hits.</p>

<p>This simplicity transfers across to enemy details, which has stats for their attacks, armor/hit points, and any special rules they have, and to player characters, who are made up of 5 stats, swiftness, spirit, vigor, resilience and honor, along with their hit points, special rules and equipment.</p>

<p>Most of the stats are used for tests, but the honor stat plays a huge part in <em>Ronin</em>, beyond working out how others interact with you. If your character dies with less than 10 honor, you get a negative modifier to your next character's stats, and with honor 10 or more, a positive modifier. If you commit a dishonorable act, you can commit seppuku, or ritual suicide, by passing a spirit and then a resilience test to regain some honor.</p>

<p>If your character dies, all is not lost, you get 1 chance to win against a powerful demon, being resurrected in success, or dying as normal in defeat. The quickness of character creation should be an indication of how long your characters should expected to survive, and if it's not that obvious, the very first page of the rules is a woe table, where each day, the GM randomly determines a woe that affects the land, and there's only ever 7 rolls.</p>

<p><em>Ronin</em> has 10 different character classes, some drawn from history, others from popular culture. Character creation, and the options including equipment, take up a full quarter of the rulebook, and is by far the lengthiest section. The character class options are:</p>

<ul><li>Forgotten Ronin - The masterless&nbsp;samurai from history</li>
	<li>Eurdite Samurai - A scholarly samurai</li>
	<li>Drunken Monk - A zen master of the drunken kung-fu style</li>
	<li>Corrupted Shinobi - The elite warriors of the night, the ninja</li>
	<li>Onmyoji - Powerful magic users who harness the spirits</li>
	<li>Bakuto - Gambling tricksters</li>
	<li>Yamabushi - Spiritual hermit monks</li>
	<li>Wild Dancer - A katana and revolver-wielding warrior</li>
	<li>Reckless Sumo - The huge and powerful wrestling martial artists</li>
	<li>Sword Saint - A samurai master duelist</li>
</ul><p>Each character class has some modifications to the 4 stats, special abilities that can be chosen or randomly determined, and starting equipment. You can also opt to not use a class and roll up a character yourself using a slightly different set of rules.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/ronin-rpg-5.jpg?itok=vEfX7e78 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/ronin-rpg-5.jpg?itok=Nz7xGT4a 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The&nbsp;<em>Ronin&nbsp;</em>character sheet is a reflection of how simple, yet effective the rules-lite system is [Credit - <a href="https://slightlyrecklessgames.com/pages/free-stuff-ronin" rel="nofollow">Slightly Reckless Games website</a>].</figcaption></figure><h2>Sometimes Heroes Fight Alone</h2>

<p>The <em>Ronin</em> core rulebook ends with details of some common types of enemies and the Blood Rains over the Crimson Jungle introductory adventure, but also currently available are two short Zines. The first, Frozen Tears of the Lady of the Snow, is another adventure for <em>Ronin</em>, and Tales of the Masterless, which contains tables and details for running a game of <em>Ronin</em> solo.</p>

<p>As explained above, because combat (and tests in general) are so simple and don't require rolls from the GM, <em>Ronin</em> plays extremely well solo, and the Tales of the Masterless zine simply gives you the tools to create scenarios quickly. It also provides the tools for the GM to roll up a scenario or dungeon effortlessly to keep the game flowing, and is a fantastic little supplement for both uses.</p>

<p><em>Ronin</em> is a rules-lite, incredibly thematic, samurai-themed apocalyptic RPG. Players should go into this not getting too attached to their characters, but the speed of character creation and play offset the length of character use. The honor system, resurrection, and subsequent character creation rules play very well into the system, and despite its small size, the book is full of details. It's gloriously chaotic, brutal, and a lot of fun.</p>

<p>Because of how lite the system is, it might not be ideal for first-time GMs introducing first-time players to roleplaying. That's not to say it can't be done, and fans of the setting, or related anime, manga, and video games, will make it work with knowledge of the background. The rules-lite nature does make running games very easy (especially if combined with Tales of the Masterless), but some knowledge of roleplaying games and feudal Japan will make it a lot more enjoyable for your players.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/mighty-boards-announces-art-society-deluxe-edition-kickstarter-alongside-new-board<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Art Society Deluxe Edition</em> is coming to Kickstarter. The tabletop publisher Mighty Boards is introducing a new and improved version of one of 2024's biggest games, along with a new board game project, at Spiel 2025 and Pax Unplugged.</p>

<h2>The <em>Art Society Deluxe Edition</em> Kickstarter Announcement</h2>

<p>According to an official press release, <em>Art Society Deluxe Edition</em> is a revised version of the beloved board game. This edition will feature shinier paintings, wooden gavels, a redesigned storage solution, and a limited-edition game box.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/art-society-board-game-game-pieces.jpg?itok=AEYEQ1_a 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/art-society-board-game-game-pieces.jpg?itok=6haKfJ2c 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The original version of <em>Art Society</em> was designed by Mitch Wallace and featured artwork by Veronica Grassi and Max Kosek. The game has 2-4 players act as art connoisseurs. You would take turns buying art pieces at auctions, then arranging those pieces into a curated gallery. Whoever has the best gallery at the end wins. Easier said than done since no one can predict what art styles will be fashionable in the future.</p>

<p>At the time of writing, details on the <em>Art Society Deluxe Edition</em> are scarce. It is unclear if the campaign will include substantive stretch goals or campaign-exclusive expansion packs. But given the popularity and success of the original game, it is a strong foundation to build upon.</p>

<p>In the same press release, Mighty Boards announced that their newest project, <em>Red North</em>. The game, designed by James Dickinson, is the latest edition of Saer, a Viking-themed strategic card game.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/red-north-box-artwork.jpg?itok=2ItBSiyM 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/red-north-box-artwork.jpg?itok=3nYZqpNI 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Players compete through hidden hands of different warrior factions to conquer enemy outposts. But resources are scarce, so players will need to balance their deployed warriors and their reserves for the final round. That final round, called Ragnarok, is the final battle for all of the marbles. A battle so epic that even the Norse Gods are involved on the battlefield.</p>

<p><em>Red North</em> is available for pre-order now at an MSRP of $25. If you are attending either Spiel 2025 or Pax Unplugged, you can pick up your ordered copy at that event at no additional charge.</p>

Okay, now, I know you've probably read that headline and thought to yourself "why on earth would outdated UI in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/silent-hill-f">Silent Hill f</a> be a good thing?" Allow me to explain! To be a contrarian for a moment, I think that a large amount of triple-A games have incredibly boring UI. It's very much because of that late 2010s trend of simple, emboss-free graphic design you see in logo design everywhere these days, and I hate it. 
</p>

<p>
Silent Hill f, however, as shown off during today's Konami Press Start showcase, looks to have UI that would fit right at home in a PS3 game. It's outdated, technically, but it looks like it's been built with a lot more thought. It's not even particularly complicated - there's a health bar, a stamina bar, some kind of… floral and crescent moon bars. There's a light ugliness about it that I think a lot of games on the PS3 also had, even games like <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dark-souls">Dark Souls</a>, that I find a lot more appealing than the modern, clean aesthetic you'll see a lot of. Just compare the original Demon Souls and its remake, for example.

The showcase did also do a bit of a deep dive into the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-horror-games">horror</a> game's gameplay, which, as is typical of the series, looks like you'll be swinging around a metal pipe a lot. Game director Al Yang did say the team is hoping to make sure the combat system is "fresh, but familiar, yet also be thematically appropriate and not overly complex."
</p>
<p>
I couldn't tell you if they've done that or not, though it doesn't matter to me all that much. It's not like I come to the Silent Hill series for exciting mechanics, I'm in it for the vibes. And the vibes do look good! There were some brief looks at some concept art, and the team spoke of how they set the game in the Showar era to tap into customs and superstitions "long forgotten in modern life."
</p>
<p>
I'm certainly a lot more interested in Silent Hill f than I am the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/silent-hill-1-remake-announced-with-the-briefest-of-teaser-trailers">remake of the first game that was also announced</a>. It's the first new entry in years (no I'm not counting Ascension), so if anything I'm morbidly curious as to whether or not the world can actually be expanded in such a way or not. Plus, again, I like how unclean the UI is! I'm a simple person, with simple needs.
</p>
<p>
Silent Hill f is due out September 25th, later this year.

                <p>Players have discovered the information <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mario-kart-9-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6528874/" data-ref-id="1100-6528874">Mario Kart World</a> gives about the stats of its character and karts isn't entirely true, as testing certain combinations of characters and vehicles have produced some surprising results.</p><p>Just as in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/mario-kart-8/" data-ref-id="5000-167695">Mario Kart 8</a>, Mario Kart World displays basic character and kart information like top speed, acceleration, weight, and handling. These stats are affected by the size of the characters, which are categorized into different unofficial weight classes. Extremely small or light characters, like all of the game's baby characters as well as some others, will have higher acceleration and lower top speeds, while heavy characters like Bowser and Donkey Kong will have higher top speeds but lower acceleration. The game doesn't tell players this outright, but it can be gleaned by selecting the same kart with different characters and seeing how the stat graph changes or stays the same.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_j7KZJbAbk" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/N_j7KZJbAbk" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>However, there are seemingly even more hidden stats that the game doesn't tell players about. As highlighted in a video by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@svcTyler" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">svcTyler</a> on YouTube, it appears some character and kart combinations are simply better than others in specific situations, despite the in-game stat graph showing that they should be identical. According to the video, certain characters and karts secretly perform better on certain types of terrain. Wario, for example, goes faster on paved tracks, while characters like Cow go faster on dirt roads. That means even though Wario and Waluigi are in same weight class, and even if they use the same kart, Wario will always be faster when driving on a normal road.</p><p>Since Nintendo is unlikely to ever give players the data they want outright, more testing will need to be done in the days and weeks ahead to learn which characters and karts excel in which situations. It's a fascinating revelation that adds an interesting wrinkle when it comes to selecting what character and kart to use, as the answer to what is best will depend on the track you're racing on. The question still remains why Nintendo doesn't just put all this secret information in-game for everyone to see, but at least it gives hardcore Mario Kart World players something to pursue in their quest for top times.</p><p>In GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/mario-kart-world-review/1900-6418371/" data-ref-id="1900-6418371">Mario Kart World review</a>, we said the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/every-nintendo-switch-2-launch-game/2900-6401/" data-ref-id="2900-6401">Nintendo Switch 2 launch game</a> expands on almost everything that made Mario Kart 8 such a success, providing a "fun and rewarding kart racing experience that's easy to understand" while still providing "enough mechanical nuance to reward veteran kart racers."</p><p>Secret character stats aren't the only thing Mario Kart World doesn't tell players. It also doesn't disclose <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-to-unlock-mirror-mode-in-mario-kart-world/1100-6532291/" data-ref-id="1100-6532291">how to unlock Mirror Mode</a> or that you can actually <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dodge-blue-shells-in-mario-kart-world-with-this-one-weird-trick/1100-6532191/" data-ref-id="1100-6532191">dodge Blue Shells using the game's new rewind feature</a>.</p>

                <p>PvP is a big part of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/dune-awakening/" data-ref-id="5000-570883">Dune: Awakening</a>, Funcom's newly released survival MMO based on Frank Herbert's legendary sci-fi series, and some players have already found a busted strategy that the developers are looking to fix "ASAP."</p><p dir="ltr">Dune: Awakening released on June 5 for those who paid for the game's pricier editions (or June 10 for everyone else), and some players have already reached its PvP-focused endgame--the Deep Desert. It's there where the game's most precious resource, Spice, is found, and where players duke it out in large-scale PvP to come out on top.</p><p dir="ltr">As some players have learned the hard way, however, coming out on top can be quite literal, as a new meta involving the game's flying Ornithopter vehicles is seeing helpless players crushed from above over and over again. One player took to the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/duneawakening/comments/1l92wsl/dune_developpers_i_agree_to_have_a_defeat_in_pvp/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Dune: Awakening subreddit</a> (via <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dune-awakening-pvp-is-being-dominated-by-one-busted-technique-crushing-people-with-helicopters" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Eurogamer</a>) and posted a video of their plight. The video shows user Bombe18 repeatedly crushed by an Ornithopter crashing into the ground. Every time Bombe18 self-revives, they are crushed again, and soon a second Ornithopter shows up to make Bombe18's life even more miserable.</p><p dir="ltr">The video prompted a response from Funcom's Joel Bylos, who responded to the video by stating "Sorry about this. We have people working on fixing the goomba stomping ASAP." Bylos didn't go into more detail on what exactly the fix would entail, but players on Reddit seem to agree that Ornithopters should be taking damage from ramming into the ground at high speeds.</p><p dir="ltr">Dune: Awakening does give players tools to deal with vehicles, such as explosive weaponry. Players being divebombed by Ornithopters could also use a vehicle of their own to try and escape or hit back. That being said, flying vehicles able to crash into the ground with no concern for their own well-being does seem like an issue that needs to be addressed, so it's good to see Funcom is paying close attention.</p><p dir="ltr">For those looking to do their own Ornithopter diving runs, check out our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-to-unlock-craft-and-repair-all-dune-awakening-vehicles/1100-6532312/" data-ref-id="1100-6532312">Dune: Awakening guide on how to unlock and craft vehicles</a>, as well as our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/6-beginner-tips-to-help-you-survive-arrakis-in-dune-awakening/2900-6645/" data-ref-id="2900-6645">beginner tips for surviving on Arrakis</a>.

Kris can lead the gang into a closet full of empty gift boxes, and if Kris chooses to examine several of the boxes, Noelle will ask Kris what they're doing.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">To this, Susie reponds, "I mean... gotta admit this room is kinda sus... especially that vent." Noelle then replies, "Haha, nice reference, Susie!" ...though Susie doesn't seem to know what Noelle is talking about ("Huh? ...reference?")</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Susie was, of course, accidentally calling to mind Among Us, both by using the word "sus" and referencing vents, which Among Us players frequently hide in. This has seemingly thrilled the Innersloth social media person, who <a href="https://x.com/AmongUsGame/status/1932974746993557525" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">took to X / Twitter to say</a>, "AHHHHH AMONG US REFERENCE IN DELTARUNE SKDJDSLSLX;LSKDK IMMA CRASH OUT" followed by "thanks king @tobyfox"</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In response, Fox decided to do a little trolling:</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="qme" dir="ltr"> <a href="https://t.co/2D52MGxkrD" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/2D52MGxkrD</a></p>— tobyfox (@tobyfox) <a href="https://twitter.com/tobyfox/status/1933018467537727567?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">June 12, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">He posted a fake screenshot of Deltarune patch notes, which read:</p><blockquote>We are releasing a hotfix for PC &amp; Mac to remedy some issues occurring in the game. You can confirm the version number on the bottom right of the file select screen.</blockquote><blockquote>Changelist</blockquote><blockquote>Ch4 v.0.0.088 8</blockquote><blockquote>Removed among us</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">Innersloth replied with "RESPECT." If it's not apparent, Fox didn't actually remove the reference; he's just goofing around. Funnily enough, this gag is also a silly way to note that Fox has been playing around with version numbers: the 2021 release of chapters 1 and 2 was marked as version 1.0, but instead of chapters 3 and 4 being 2.0, the new release was v.0.0.087.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Deltarune chapters 3 and 4 <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/deltarune-chapters-3-and-4-are-out-now-and-its-already-exploding-on-steam">launched last week to immediate skyrocketing popularity on Steam</a>, and our own reviewer <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/deltarune-review">gave the full game a 9/10</a>, saying that even though the story's only halfway done, "Deltarune's incredible story is already bursting with hilarious charm, unforgettable characters, and an iconic soundtrack that make it worth investing your time in."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

The June 12 patch notes detail several improvements to Grief mode for Zombies. It also addresses a bug for the recently disabled "Numbers" skin for Woods.</p><p dir="ltr">Most of the update focuses on multiplayer and Zombies. However, the patch notes address an issue with Season 4's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/cod-black-ops-6-and-warzone-how-to-unlock-essex-model-07-and-all-ballerina-event-rewards/2900-6642/">Essex Model 07 marksman rifle</a>, which previously prevented the rapid fire attachment from working properly in both Black Ops 6 and Warzone.</p><p dir="ltr">Recently, the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/this-call-of-duty-skin-is-broken-and-temporarily-removed/1100-6532174/" data-ref-id="1100-6532174">Numbers operator skin for Frank Woods was disabled</a> for a visual bug, but this update addresses the issue. This means players who own this skin should be able to use it again in both games.</p><p dir="ltr">Treyarch details several improvements for Grief mode in Zombies, which are designed to help reduce the match length and intensify the rounds. These includes a five-minute cooldown for Gobblegums, a reduction to salvage drops, and the zombies now deal more damage to players. Treyarch says this damage change means it should only take four hits for a player to go down, assuming they have armor and perks. Additionally, Chopper Gunner and Mutant Injection streaks no longer drop from special and elite enemies, and the crafting of self-revives is now limited to one per player.</p><p dir="ltr">For another positive change, players who are AFK in Grief mode will be kicked from matches more quickly. This seems to be just the beginning of quality-of-life improvements for the mode. "We've got more updates in testing, and the team is continuing to work on making all griefs more impactful," the developer wrote.</p><p dir="ltr">The full patch notes for Black Ops 6 can be found below, as <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/patchnotes/2025/05/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-season-04-patch-notes" rel="nofollow ">shared by Activision</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">In other news, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-2025-everything-we-know-about-rumored-black-ops-2-sequel/1100-6529073/">Activision announced Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</a> during June's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/xbox-games-showcase-2025-all-the-biggest-announcements/2900-6656/" data-ref-id="2900-6656">Xbox Games Showcase</a>. This marks the first time in franchise history that Activision is releasing Black Ops titles in consecutive years.</p><h2>CALL OF DUTY GLOBAL PATCH NOTES</h2><h3>Gunsmith</h3><ul><li><b>Essex Model 07</b><ul><li>Addressed an issue where the Rapid Fire Mod was not functioning as intended.</li></ul></li></ul><h3>Graphics</h3><ul><li>Addressed an issue where the “Numbers Woods” Operator Skin for Woods would appear bright red in the lobby.</li></ul><h2>ZOMBIES</h2><h3>Maps</h3><ul><li><b>Liberty Falls</b><ul><li>Addressed an exploit with Shock Charges.</li></ul></li></ul><h3>Modes</h3><p><strong>Grief:</strong></p><p>Today, we’ve deployed a new round of Grief tuning changes focused on reducing match length and increasing the intensity of each game. The biggest of these changes boosts the threat of the zombies, so even our base zombies feel dangerous early on and only get deadlier as the rounds go up. When the pace of the game increases, so should the danger of making a mistake! With these new damage values, we’re targeting 4 hits to go down for players who've been keeping up with their Perks and Armor buys.</p><p>We’ve also implemented changes to limit players’ ability to extend a match beyond its intended ceiling. Today’s update limits GobbleGum availability by extending the machine’s cooldown to 5 minutes, with more tweaks to GobbleGum usage potentially planned for the future based on player data. Salvage drops have also been reduced from 100 to 50 per pickup, Chopper Gunner and Mutant Injection can no longer drop from Specials and Elites, and crafting Self-Revives is now limited to 1 per player. This should all result in more intense sessions for everyone... and ideally fewer multi-hour matches!</p><p>Like you, we've also been bummed out by AFK players in our matches and will now kick them out sooner.

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> How IO Interactive Is Making James Bond Different From Hitman</p>
      </div>
<p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-james-bond-game-first-light-release-date-trailer-story/1100-6531773/" data-ref-id="1100-6531773">007: First Light</a> is IO Interactive's first licensed game. Abrak said that the only reason they took the project on is that their partners gave them "freedom" to express themselves within the game.</p><p>"From the get-go we didn't want to do a gamification of a movie," Abrak said. "We really wanted to have a swing at our young Bond and his origin story. It's something a bit more dynamic and youthful."</p><p>Abrak didn't say anything more about their fantasy project during the interview, but he did bring it up unprompted meaning that they may have more to share sometime in the near future. IO Interactive has some details on a page about the project published on their <a href="https://ioi.dk/project-fantasy" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">official website.</a></p><p>"We are building a new world, a new IP--an online fantasy RPG," the site reads. "A world and a game built from the core to entertain players and expand for many years to come. It feels familiar, yet at the same time IOI is going on a journey unlike any we have been on before."</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/06/12/nintendo-switch-2-review-one-week-with-the-new-generation-handheld/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>The <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a> launched to somewhat mixed expectations, but it’s safe to say that with record-break sales through its first weekend, Nintendo has knocked this one out of the park. This is a very safe console — a more straightforward upgrade than what we’ve typically seen from this company — but one that expands and refines the original vision for the Switch.</p>
<h2>Screen time</h2>
<p>It starts with the hardware itself. While the Switch OLED was able to improve on the original design — bringing more solidity to the body, a more robust kickstand and better quality screen, the Switch 2 is able to kick on in areas that the OLED couldn’t. The screen is much larger, jumping from the original’s 6.2” and the OLED’s 7”&nbsp; to a more modern 7.9″, increasing the height of the console in the process, and there’s a new profile that’s more gently rounded at the back but has a sharper edge to the flat faced front. The kickstand has iterated on the Switch OLED’s design, using the same adjustable hinges, but having a cutout foot instead of the whole lower half of the back panel. It feels a bit flimsier, but it’s just as sturdy in practice.</p>



<p>Of course, this isn’t an OLED screen, it’s a reversion to an LCD panel. While this might be a downgrade in screen technology,&nbsp; it’s a vast improvement from the original Switch. This is a 1080p panel, it can do 120Hz with VRR, and there is a limited form of HDR – it’s not amazing HDR, but it does have an effect. The laminated screen brings the picture right up to the glass, giving better contrast and blacks, while also being powerfully bright and vibrantly colourful. It’s a nice screen, but one that will almost certainly be succeeded by a premium OLED revision down the line.</p>
<p>Part of the cost of this, both with the new chipset and the larger screen, is that battery life has slid back to a 2 to 6.5 hour range – less than the Switch OLED and roughly equivalent to the original Switch. This is obviously heavily dependent on how taxing the game is, the brightness and volume settings you have and other factors, but it feels about right. You’ll get a couple hour of Mario Kart out of it before wanting to charge, and that can be more convenient with USB-C at top and bottom of the console.</p>

<p>With the larger tablet body comes taller Joy-Con 2 on the side. These have a more rounded, softer feel in the hand, and attach with magnets instead of a metal rail, snapping in and out of place in a very satisfying fashion. We’ll have to wait and see how much creaking and flexing comes to affect these connectors over time, as they did with the Switch, but the initial concerns over their durability can be put to one side. It’s a bizarre quirk, but you can attach Joy-Con 2 upside-down and back to front, and the fact that this is possible through a purely symmetrical design is actually a good thing. Permitting mistakes makes things harder to break.</p>

<p>The increased size of the Joy-Con 2 allows for larger SR/SL rail buttons, so they’re used directly instead of having larger buttons on the wrist strap rail (which also satisfyingly uses magnets), and there’s even space for the optical sensor to enable mouse mode. Time will tell whether Joy-Con drift has a sequel — the Joy-Con 2 does not have Hall Effect analogue sticks — but the analogue sticks do now have full-sized heads to match standard game pads, even if the height is still shrunk down.</p>
<h2>Softly does it</h2>
<p>On to the software, we have a light revision of the Switch’s UI. The games are now rounded squares instead of pointed, the system icons are encased in a unified bar instead of being individual circles, and the highlighted icon now has a more animated colour instead of pulsing.</p>
<p>It is, however, significantly faster in very obvious areas. The Switch could choke and die just loading into the eShop, whereas <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/06/05/the-switch-2s-best-feature-might-be-that-the-eshop-doesnt-suck/">the new eShop on the Switch 2</a> just breezes through the massive lists of game icons. And when it comes to downloads, having SSD performance from both the internal 256GB and the new MicroSD Express standard allows you to download at full fibre internet speeds. Whether over gigabit Ethernet or WiFi 6, the Switch 2 can pull down a game at up to 400Mbps (though has more commonly been around 250–300Mbps in my experience) using my gigabit internet speeds. That’s not maxing out my connection, of course, but it’s fast enough.</p>
<div id="attachment_460341"><p id="caption-attachment-460341">The new Nintendo Switch 2 eShop homepage</p></div>
<p>And you’ll want and need that for the larger games that we’re seeing on Switch 2. Hitman: World of Assassination is 58GB, Yakuza 0 Director’s Cut is 45GB, and if they need to patch, prepare yourself for the console to demand enough space to re-write the entire game while updating. That 256GB internal storage can and will feel pretty small after a few of these ported PlayStation and Xbox staples, so the price of MicroSD Express cards can’t come down quickly enough.</p>
<h2>New Nintendo quirks</h2>
<p>The Switch 2 brings two core features to the table: GameChat and GameShare. GameChat is Nintendo finally getting onboard with built-in voice chat — they even dedicated a whole button to it! It works well, within the company’s typically constrained system. The first hitch comes when enabling GameChat, which requires a phone number to be attached to your Nintendo account in advance — without that, you’ll likely get a blank white screen that offers no help, the unstated fix being to add the number via a web browser before try. Then you manually approve which of your friends you like enough to want to talk to, adding a further layer to needing to still use friend codes. But once you’ve jumped through the hoops, voice chat is… fine.</p>
<p>The audio quality from the built-in microphone does an OK job of relaying what people are saying, though you will be best using a headset. What’s curious is the desire to have the chat tiles along the bottom of the screen, shrinking the play screen down above it — It’s like a Zoom call where the main tile is your game. This is acceptable when on a large TV, but you really feel the smaller play area when in handheld. Thankfully there are three layout settings, so you can have smaller thumbnails or just have the game full screen while anyone that’s speaking is highlighted in the top corner.</p>

<p>Of course, the intention is that people have cameras turned on and share their game screen. I do like having the camera enabled — it’s quite a bit of fun for Mario Kart where your face appears in-game — and there’s good Nvidia-powered features to track your face, blur backgrounds and the like… but when everyone’s gameplay is streamed at just 10fps, it’s much more of a distracting judder than it should be.</p>
<p>It could be made more elegant: for example, it could start full screen and indicate whether someone starts us using a camera, while speakers could be represented by avatars instead of names, and the chat icons positioned by the player to avoid blocking the UI. It’s a decent start that I hope will be improved over time.</p>
<p>GameShare, meanwhile, is the Switch 2’s replacement for DS Download Play, and a cleverly adapted take on PlayStation’s Share Play and Steam’s Remote Play Together. The host invites people to join them for GameShare, the Switch 2 then renders and streams the game to everyone else’s devices. But there’s a unique twist in that every player can have their own view, instead of sharing the full screen. In 51 Clubhouse Games, you can all have your own secret hand of cards; in Fast Fusion, you each have a full view instead of having the split-screen. Well… I say “full”, but there’s an infuriating info bar announcing that this is GameShare on the top of the screen that actually shrinks your view. Why, Nintendo? Why is this not just a bubble in the corner of the screen?</p>

<p>It’s an ingenious twist, something that nobody else is doing, even if it’s inherently limited. GameShare has to be enabled by developers on a game-by-game basis, and within that it’s specified whether games can be shared via local WiFi and via GameChat, and whether it can work with the original Switch as well. The encoded stream is good — it’s NVENC, after all — but it can struggle with something like Fast Fusion, where the world is whizzing by at lightning speed.</p>
<h2>Launch library</h2>
<p>Turning to the games, we see where the Switch 2 is currently at its weakest. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/06/12/mario-kart-world-review/">Mario Kart World</a> is the only truly essential game for this console right now, though anti-grav racing connoisseurs would argue for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/06/06/fast-fusion-review/">Fast Fusion</a>. Aside from that, current Switch 2 gaming is really all about upgrades, ports, patches and backward compatibility, and the future holds plenty of cross-gen games as Nintendo tries to cling onto the vast Switch playerbase for as long as possible.</p>

<p>It’s not as exciting, but the Switch 2 holds up very well in the comparisons. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/06/12/cyberpunk-2077-switch-2-review-ps4-xbox-comparison/">Cyberpunk 2077 Ultimate Edition is a very good port</a> that makes the most of DLSS to deliver 1080p30 consistently on Switch 2, comparing very favourably to the Xbox Series S, albeit with more limited resolution and performance targets. Hitman: World of Assassination is an all-encompassing collection that performs handily, and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/05/21/yakuza-0-directors-cut-red-light-raiding-in-switch-2s-exclusive-multiplayer-mode/">Yakuza 0 is a good port</a> of a game that really doesn’t trouble the Switch 2 in the slightest.</p>
<p>There’s all the games that have received Switch 2 patches. Lumping the paid <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/24/nintendo-switch-2-edition-game-upgrade-prices-set-at-8-and-17-depending-on-the-game/">Switch 2 Editions</a> of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2017/03/02/the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-review/">Breath of the Wild</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/05/11/the-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-review/">Tears of the Kingdom</a> in here alongside free updates to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2017/06/07/arms-review/">ARMS</a>, Super Mario Odyssey, Link’s Awakening, Echoes of Wisdom and more, you’ve got a range of improvements, from resolution bumps, to frame rates, added HDR and the addition of GameShare in multiplayer games.</p>
<p>The difference is more noticeable in some games than others. The stuttering of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/09/19/links-awakening-switch-review-the-legend-of-zelda-remake/">Link’s Awakening</a> has been vanquished, BOTW and TOTK jump up to 60fps, and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/11/17/pokemon-scarlet-and-violet-review/">Pokémon Scarlet &amp; Violet</a> is just a night and day difference — it’s staggering how naff it still is on the original Switch.</p>

<p>But then there’s <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/06/11/how-the-switch-2-fixed-bad-switch-1-frame-rates-even-without-patches/">the rest of the Switch back catalogue</a> — all the games with troubled performance and the “impossible” ports. The Switch 2 runs these games through a translation layer, similar to Apple’s Rosetta and Valve’s Proton, dynamically translating calls to match new APIs and chip capabilities, and the results can lift a lot of games with troubled performance out of the mire. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/10/25/bayonetta-3-review/">Bayonetta 3</a> is basically a locked 60fps now instead of lurching back and forth in the 40’s and 50’s; <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/11/18/hyrule-warriors-age-of-calamity-review/">Hyrule Warriors: Age of Calamity</a> locks to 30fps and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/06/21/fire-emblem-warriors-three-hopes-review-switch-musou/">Fire Emblem: Three Hopes</a> shoots up to 60fps with its unlocked frame rate, and on, and on. The impact will be constrained by frame rate caps and resolution limits, so all of these games would benefit from a patch to add Switch 2 appropriate performance profiles, but at a base level this is a major improvement.</p>

            <p>
I feel like every time I write about <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">shooters</a>, I always have to add a caveat along the lines of, "I don't really like shooters… but!" There often is a but, because occasionally one of 'em rolls around that feels like it just gets me, you know? This week, it's a shooter that feels like it was born to be a Flash game on Newgrounds in the mid-2000s that you'll sometimes bring up to your friends saying "man, remember that one game?" It's called Shooty Shooty Robot Invasion, and as simple as its title is, there's a lot going for it.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
For one, it's being made by Bubby Darkstar, the same developer behind 2021's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1750570/Subway_Midnight/">Subway Midnight</a>, a game I'm always surprised by insofar that it doesn't have as far reaching an obsessive fan base as I thought it would get. Subway Midnight is already a visually surreal delight, but Shooty Shooty Robot Invasion really looks like it's amping up the balls to the walls zaniness factor. It apparently has over 200 NPCs to "interact and have terrible conversations with," all of which are hand-drawn, a kind of ridiculous feat for what I think might be a dev team of not much more than one.

<p>
You've also got more than 50 unique robots to take on, dozens of bosses, "a guy named 'Donnie' who's a real freak" and six levels to wade through. Gameplay wise it looks like your classic boomer shooter by way of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/adventure-time">Adventure Time</a>, plenty of regular guns to find and use, alongside a few weirder ones. This thing just looks worth playing through if you're an animation lover alone, the colours are so vibrant and some of the designs on display feel like they were born to be turned into Twitter profile pictures (but like, when Twitter wasn't what it is now, when it was sometimes ok and not a constant hellfire).
</p>
<p>
The trailer also clearly points out that not a drop of generative AI was used to make it, a disclaimer that I wish didn't have to exist, but one I'm glad to see all the same. It's not too far away from release either - currently it's slated to be released next month, July 10th. In the meantime, you can wishlist it on Steam <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3763820/Shooty_Shooty_Robot_Invasion/?curator_clanid=4777282">here</a>.

The Kishi V3 Pro models are the first dedicated mobile controllers from a major manufacturer to utilize TMR sticks.</p><p dir="ltr">The V3 Pro XL has two remappable back buttons and a pair of extra shoulder buttons geared toward claw-grip players. It has Razer's mecha-tactile face buttons and an 8-way D-pad activated by microswitches. Both handles are shaped like traditional controller grips, and each one has a rumble motor with Sensa HD Haptics, Razer's proprietary rumble system designed to increase immersion--it's the same general idea as Nintendo's HD Rumble and PlayStation's DualSense haptics.</p><p dir="ltr">The new Kishi controllers support Razer's Nexus App, a game launcher for native iOS and Android games, as well as Razer PC Remote Play. If you have an iPad with powerful enough specs--M1 or better is recommended--you could use the new Kishi V3 Pro XL to play a few of the AAA games that have been ported to Apple platforms, including Death Stranding and multiple Resident Evil games, on a giant Nintendo Switch-like handheld.</p><p dir="ltr">The V3 Pro XL includes a six-month subscription to Apple Arcade for new and eligible returning subscribers.</p></div>                      </div>                                                                     <div>             <h2>                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Kishi-Gaming-Controller-iPhone-Android-Smartphone/dp/B0F231T7BG?tag=gamespot-promos-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Kishi-Gaming-Controller-iPhone-Android-Smartphone\/dp\/B0F231T7BG?tag=gamespot-promos-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/Kishi-Gaming-Controller-iPhone-Android-Smartphone/dp/B0F231T7BG?tag=gamespot-promos-20">Razer Kishi V3 Pro for Phones &amp; Tablets up to 8"</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Kishi-Gaming-Controller-iPhone-Android-Smartphone/dp/B0F231T7BG?tag=gamespot-promos-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Kishi-Gaming-Controller-iPhone-Android-Smartphone\/dp\/B0F231T7BG?tag=gamespot-promos-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/Kishi-Gaming-Controller-iPhone-Android-Smartphone/dp/B0F231T7BG?tag=gamespot-promos-20">$150</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <div><p>The Kishi V3 Pro has the same tech as the XL model, just geared toward smaller mobile devices.

It doesn't have the claw-grip bumpers or Sensa HD Haptics, and the face buttons and D-pad don't have the mouse-click feel and feedback. The four-way D-pad and buttons are "Quiet-tactile," which is likely a fancy way to say they feel conventional.</p><p>The Kishi V3 should fit most Android smartphones thanks to its "island" design and thicker depth clearance, and it also comes with three months of Apple Arcade for free.</p></div>                      </div>   </div><p>Razer isn't the only player in this game, as GameSir offers its own controller cradle for tablets.

This one syncs via Bluetooth and supports iOS and Android devices up to 8.5 inches. It's also compatible with Nintendo Switch and the new Switch 2, which is a big perk.</p><p>Smartphone owners can also <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/backbone-pro-is-a-larger-more-customizable-version-of-the-best-mobile-controller/1100-6531316/" data-ref-id="1100-6531316">check out the new Backbone Pro</a>, which offers a pro-style setup to mobile gaming. Building off of the foundation established by the Backbone One, this snap-on USB-C controller for iPhone 15/16 and Android phones is an impressive upgrade compared to its predecessor.</p><p>You can also use it as a wireless Bluetooth controller on tablets, PC, Mac, Steam Deck, and more devices, and it's highly customizable via the official Backbone App. Overall, this is a comfier and feature-packed successor to the Backbone One. Like Razer's V3 Pro controllers, the Backbone Pro is pricier than many mobile controllers at $170.</p><hr>

                <p>Amazon is currently offering discounts on select gaming chairs, including a few models with high-end features like built-in speakers, footrests, and additional lumbar support. Inventory is limited, and because some models are <strong>on sale at their lowest prices ever</strong>, they’re bound to sell out fast. Unfortunately, these chairs won’t ship in time for Father’s Day, but if you’re shopping for yourself (or someone patient), now is a great time to scoop up a budget gaming chair at a great low price.</p><div title="6532391 - Fathers Day Gaming Chairs" data-embed-type="buylink" data-ref-id="3692" data-template="4" data-size="buylink__listicle" data-title="6532391 - Fathers Day Gaming Chairs" data-collection="">                                                                     <div>             <h2>                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/GTRACING-Footrest-Ergonomic-Reclining-Adjustment/dp/B0DTK7VDTH?tag=gamespot-promos-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/GTRACING-Footrest-Ergonomic-Reclining-Adjustment\/dp\/B0DTK7VDTH?tag=gamespot-promos-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/GTRACING-Footrest-Ergonomic-Reclining-Adjustment/dp/B0DTK7VDTH?tag=gamespot-promos-20">GTRacing Gaming Chair with Footrest (Ocean Blue)</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/GTRACING-Footrest-Ergonomic-Reclining-Adjustment/dp/B0DTK7VDTH?tag=gamespot-promos-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/GTRACING-Footrest-Ergonomic-Reclining-Adjustment\/dp\/B0DTK7VDTH?tag=gamespot-promos-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/GTRACING-Footrest-Ergonomic-Reclining-Adjustment/dp/B0DTK7VDTH?tag=gamespot-promos-20">$100 (was $180)</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <div><p>This is the best price ever for the GTRacing Gaming Chair with Footrest.

You’ll pay a bit more at $150 (was $200), but it’s a nice alternative that packs in most of the same features as the model with the footrest, and adds a pair of Bluetooth speakers that get around 6 hours of playback on a charge. It swaps out the blue and black color scheme for one that’s largely black, plus a few red accents.</p></div>                      </div>                                                                     <div>             <h2>                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/GTRACING-Ergonomic-Comfortable-Computer-Armrests/dp/B0DXKWX22K?tag=gamespot-promos-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/GTRACING-Ergonomic-Comfortable-Computer-Armrests\/dp\/B0DXKWX22K?tag=gamespot-promos-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/GTRACING-Ergonomic-Comfortable-Computer-Armrests/dp/B0DXKWX22K?tag=gamespot-promos-20">GTRacing Gaming Office Chair (Black)</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/GTRACING-Ergonomic-Comfortable-Computer-Armrests/dp/B0DXKWX22K?tag=gamespot-promos-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/GTRACING-Ergonomic-Comfortable-Computer-Armrests\/dp\/B0DXKWX22K?tag=gamespot-promos-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/GTRACING-Ergonomic-Comfortable-Computer-Armrests/dp/B0DXKWX22K?tag=gamespot-promos-20">$160 (was $260)</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <p>This model features an unorthodox design that blurs the lines between furniture and a gaming chair, making it a good choice for a home office that doubles as a game room.

Crafted with a soft cloth material that helps airflow and disperses heat, it’s a nice alternative to the many leather chairs on the market. This black edition also features grey accents along the edges and a stitched backrest that appears more premium than its price would suggest. Beyond that, you’re getting many of the standard gaming chair features--including a 165-degree reclining angle, a wide seat, and a weight capacity up to 300 pounds. Note that this model is discontinued, so this may be the last chance to grab it before it sells out.</p>                      </div>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/morsels-preview</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/morsels-preview-a-sewer-full-of-intense-action.1217187/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/morsels-preview<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>It's been quite a while since I've played a roguelite where things just click immediately.&nbsp;<em>Morsels</em>&nbsp;is quick, intuitive, and delightful to play, which is a breath of fresh air in a genre that's become a bit too saturated for my liking.&nbsp;<em>Morsels</em>&nbsp;might just become my new addiction.</p>

<p>We played the upcoming roguelite&nbsp;<em>Morsels</em>&nbsp;at Summer Game Fest 2025. Developed by Furcula and published by Annapurna Interactive, this crunchy, grimy game has incredible potential to be the next big roguelite.</p>



<h2>Gotta Collect 'Em All --&nbsp;<em>Morsels</em>!</h2>

<p><em>Morsels</em>&nbsp;harnesses the simplicity of&nbsp;<em>Nuclear Throne</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em><a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="78d18a36-8b0c-42c8-989d-e750814ff1f1" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/enter-gungeon-review-dawn-of-gundead" rel="nofollow">Enter the Gungeon</a>&nbsp;</em>to create a palatable, easily understood gameplay loop that'll have you vying for more. The cornerstone to&nbsp;<em>Morsels</em>' gameplay are the eponymous Morsels, these "mystical cards sent from another galaxy."</p>

<p>To put it succinctly, think of Morsels as&nbsp;<a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="08100bb4-1bd2-48c8-b59b-deb62c955038" href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/guides/how-to-understand-pokemon-card-rarity" rel="nofollow"><em>Pokemon</em>&nbsp;cards</a>. The player character, a little mouse, uses these cards to escape a sewer full of cats and other dangerous monsters. The cards are actually the characters you control here, and you're given a choice to pick one right from the start.</p>

<p>That's your starter Morsel, and from there, you can accumulate experience by defeating foes. Eventually, these Morsels evolve and become more powerful versions of themselves. This is a great way to incentivize players to engage with enemies and fight them, rather than avoid encounters and rush to the end of the level.</p>



<p>You're able to gain other upgrades by finding them naturally as you navigate the sewers, so you have that very basic increase in power that roguelite players are familiar with. Eventually, you'll find more Morsels too, so your roster grows as you progress.</p>

<p>There are slots for three Morsels total, and you can swap those on the fly. If you're running low on health with one, switch to another until you can find health to health the other. It's an intuitive system that means every Morsel has a chance to shine on the battlefield.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Ticket to Winning It</h2>

<p>The way in which Morsels attack are a bit unorthodox, too. Most in the demo attack via directional inputs on the face buttons of a controller. The control scheme feels a little weird at first, but I took to it quickly. Morsels also have a special ability and dodge. Of course, Morsels are visually distinct from one another and it so are all of their attacks.</p>

<p><em>Morsels</em>&nbsp;throws a few challenges in to spice up the run and reward players. For instance, I find a ticket on one level of the sewers and need to bring it to the bus on the next. I didn't find out what giving the bus a ticket would do, but the developer watching me assured me it would be worthwhile.</p>



<p>The thing is, you can't attack while holding the ticket, so bringing it all the way to the end of a level past obstacles and enemies is no easy task. There are a few holes you might find in walls you can go into, and these start little minigames that also give players rewards to benefit you during the run.</p>

<p>I'm certain there's more depth to&nbsp;<em>Morsels</em>&nbsp;than what meets the eye; most definitely, we'll be able to play as more Morsels cards in the final product and devise a playstyle based on my preferred cards. I'm sure difficulty will only increase as time goes on, too.</p>



<h2><em>Morsels&nbsp;</em>Preview | Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>Really, I'm just enamored with the simplicity and quality&nbsp;of&nbsp;<em>Morsels</em>. Outside of its super tight gameplay, the visuals ooze with personality. The filthiness of the sewers with the crunchy, heavy CRT filter on the pixel visuals have me hungry for more.</p>

<p>At the time of publication, a demo for&nbsp;<em>Morsels</em>&nbsp;is available to the public, so do check it out if this sounds like your kind of thing. I'll be eagerly anticipated this one ahead of its launch sometime later this year.&nbsp;</p>

These days, making sweeping declarations about something’s quality can feel like a daunting task, as the internet has lost any ability to put opinions into context. If I say something is bad, that must be me making a declarative statement that readers are required by law to agree with. Thus, we get the typical internet defensiveness that follows, and the most annoying person you know starts to nitpick everything you say as being too definitive and not acknowledging that plenty of other people might feel differently. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196055" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="6 Things To Know Before Starting Persona 5 Tactica" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="227" data-playlist="196055,196599,195922" data-current="196055"><div><p>6 Things To Know Before Starting Persona 5 Tactica</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196055/196055_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196055/196055_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196055/196055_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196055/196055_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21584.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Sometimes I still get self-conscious about making definitive statements about whether or not something is “bad” or if it’s just “not for me,” especially in a preview situation where I’m playing an unfinished game. Carolyn is on vacation right now, so I feel that I must honor her and say flatly that <em>Crimson Desert </em>was one of the most frustrating demo experiences I’ve ever had in over a decade of doing this job.</p><p>One of the hardest things developers have to do in these preview settings is find a concise slice of a game for writers and content creators to experience that gives them a good enough sense of what that game is trying to accomplish, while also giving the player enough guidance to navigate their way through. The only charitable grace I can give <em>Crimson Desert </em>is that a lot of my problems might be alleviated in a final playthrough that affords me more time with its systems and enemy behaviors. But therein lies the problem with the video game industry’s current preview cycle structure. I could give <em>Crimson Desert </em>the benefit of the doubt, considering I’ve had poor experiences in previews with games that I wound up enjoying far more when I played the final product. </p><p>Is it fair to call something bad when I’ve only played it for 30 minutes? One would argue yes, as those are the terms of the unwritten agreement between developers and critics when previews are arranged – show me what you’ve got, and I’ll give my opinion on it. Now, would I keep playing <em>Crimson Desert </em>if this were my first impression of it, freshly downloaded onto my PS5 back home? Absolutely not, because the issues I had with it are the type of thing that would have made me drop it in five minutes. Lastly, am I cognizant that there is a subset of the internet that will take every negative criticism I write here as an albatross around the game’s neck, which it will never be able to relieve itself from, and that might inform why I’m hesitant to cast a dark shadow over it before it’s even out? Obviously yes.</p><p>Like I said, I’ve been doing this a while, and if I’ve learned anything over the third of my time on this planet writing about video games on the internet, it’s knowing that having a stray thought, a knee-jerk reaction, or even publishing the most well-thought-out argument in the history of the written word often opens you up to willful misinterpretation and accusations of some kind of agenda in which you are rooting for a game to fail. </p><p>But despite the game not yet having a chance to speak for itself, it’s not unfair for me to tell the world that <em>Crimson Desert </em>nearly pushed me to the level of Gamer Crash Out that you see in cautionary television caricatures. Developers put their games in these showcases fully knowing they may get a wide range of reactions. But the level of frustration I felt playing <em>Crimson Desert </em>probably goes beyond what anyone involved expected. I could feel my annoyance creeping into other parts of my mind as my thoughts bounced between every other frustration I was feeling in Los Angeles that day. It all coalesced as I fumbled with the game’s unintuitive controls, being pestered by a massive crowd of enemies who never seemed to lose aggro, no matter how far I rode my horse to get away from them while trying to reach my quest objective. All of this exasperation followed me as I tried to reach a boss fight that displayed the game’s combat potential, which was immediately hampered by one of the most frustratingly obtuse video game interaction systems I’ve ever dealt with.</p><p>Question: How many button prompts should it take to pick up an object, in your opinion? One or so, right? <em>Crimson Desert </em>has a system in which you pick up heavier objects by magically lifting them, then holding them on your shoulder before you place (or swing) them. To do this, you press down both analog sticks, aim a reticle at the object in question, repeatedly tap a button to lift it in the air, then, when you’ve done this enough, you can finally hoist your target over your shoulder and do with it what you will. At first, I did this with a fallen flag that needed to be raised once more, and it felt awkward and convoluted under the most mundane circumstances. The next time I encountered this mechanic was during the aforementioned boss fight, in which my foe would knock down pillars in the arena where we were fighting. After smacking him around a bit, I would magically lift these structures off the ground, then bonk him on the head to erase a chunk of his health bar. If I take too long to get this hunk of stone in the air, homeboy gets off the ground and starts fighting again. Do you know how much of a needless struggle it is to beat someone with a pillar when you have to go through an absurd amount of button presses to do something that’s much simpler in most games?</p><p>Getting to this climactic fight was also a pain in the ass because as I was riding past enemies in a warzone trying to reach my objective. Entire platoons of foes would break off from other fights to chase me across a battlefield like I owed them money or fucked their dads. <em>Crimson Desert</em>’s hero is a remarkably sturdy dude, which means he can take plenty of hits if one of these men who may or may not have had their fathers fucked ever caught up to me. If half a dozen of them did, they would hackey sack me around a field. </p><p><em>Crimson Desert </em>feels weighty in that your character moves as if he’s running with an oversized backpack on. That clunkiness intensifies as you get knocked around by enemies, making it difficult to reorient yourself and get back in the fight after a good toss around. All I had to defend myself with was the sword in my sheath and bow on my back, and using them in ways that could fight off multiple enemies at once was just as obtuse as picking up an object off the ground. One of the attacks you have in your arsenal is shooting arrows on the ground to direct an artillery strike to take down, but it’s hard to pull an arrow back on a string and shoot it at a target when I’m busy getting tossed like a Frisbee on a crowded college campus (and not in the fun way!). Some of my sword swings can strike multiple enemies at once, but they, like most actions in <em>Crimson Desert</em>, require more complex inputs than your average action game, making them a pain to execute when I’m surrounded.</p><p>When I started the demo, the developer warned me the game’s systems were “complex,” and in the time I was able to spend with them, “cumbersome” felt like a more apt descriptor. Usually, when a game is complicated or challenging, I can see the vision for why. But playing <em>Crimson Desert </em>just felt like I was trying to hold melting putty in my hands as it slipped through my fingers. Yeah, maybe that’s harsh for a game that’s not out yet, and that I played in a disorienting context most people will never experience, but by the time I was done, the only thing keeping steam from coming out of my ears was the headset I wore at the demo station.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Still are, but now they’re enhanced, beautified for the modern gamer. One side quest retains its crown as the best, despite the game’s age. “A Brush With Death” is <em>Oblivion Remastered</em>’s best side quest by far, and here’s how to find and beat it!</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195579" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="This Narrative Adventure About Doomed Teenage Dinosaurs Feels Too Real" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="178" data-playlist="195579,196411,195891" data-current="195579"><div><p>This Narrative Adventure About Doomed Teenage Dinosaurs Feels Too Real</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195579/195579_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195579/195579_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195579/195579_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195579/195579_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21074.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><h2 id="h736697"><a id="1"></a>Where to find ‘A Brush With Death’</h2><figure id="" data-id="c368227e3247365403833ab23f7a30a1" data-recommend-id="image://c368227e3247365403833ab23f7a30a1" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The magical painting portal in A Brush With Death in Oblivion Remastered." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The magical painting portal in A Brush With Death in Oblivion Remastered." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Photo<!-- -->: <!-- -->Bethesda / Brandon Morgan / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="c368227e3247365403833ab23f7a30a1" data-recommend-id="image://c368227e3247365403833ab23f7a30a1" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The magical painting portal in A Brush With Death in Oblivion Remastered." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Like most good side quests in the game, you’ll first encounter “A Brush With Death” by speaking with the many beggars and citizens in Cheydinhal. Eventually, someone will tell you about a local painter, Rythe Lythandas, who suddenly disappeared.</p><p>It’s time to investigate! You can find Tivela Lythandas, Rythe’s wife, at their home in the residential district of the city. She’ll explain that the man locked himself in his painting studio and hasn’t come out, he’s just gone. You’ll receive Rythe’s Studio Key from her, and delving into the darkest depths of a painter’s mind will lead you to a mysterious painting that you can enter.</p><h2 id="h736698"><a id="2"></a>How to complete ‘A Brush With Death’</h2><figure id="" data-id="51152c688c75afd181759fa8a95d9e87" data-recommend-id="image://51152c688c75afd181759fa8a95d9e87" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The famous painter, Rythe Lythandas, in A Brush With Death in Oblivion Remastered." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The famous painter, Rythe Lythandas, in A Brush With Death in Oblivion Remastered." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Bethesda / Brandon Morgan / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="51152c688c75afd181759fa8a95d9e87" data-recommend-id="image://51152c688c75afd181759fa8a95d9e87" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The famous painter, Rythe Lythandas, in A Brush With Death in Oblivion Remastered." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>As it turns out, the painting is a magic portal leading you into an artistic world in which everything—from Rythe to the trees surrounding you—is a masterful brush stroke.

Thanks to the innate sense of direction most gamers have, you should have no trouble following the clear path deeper into the forest.</p><p>But first, trolls! </p><p>The thief didn’t make it far, all thanks to a small horde of Painted Trolls. You can deal with them pretty easily by exhausting all dialogue with Rythe. He’ll provide you with six Turpentines, which buff you significantly. Each one allows you to deal +100 damage to Painted Trolls once applied to your physical weapon.

It doesn’t include 300 media apps nobody uses. It won’t ever support some silly AI co-pilot that can “help” you play <em>Overwatch 2.</em> It doesn’t include NFTs or blockchain tools. </p><p>Instead, the Switch 2 is just a better version of a video game console you already liked, but now it runs faster, looks better, and boasts a few smart improvements. Its store, while still filled with slop, is faster and snappier than ever. GameChat is great! Nintendo seems to have realized that people love Discord and has built a simple-to-use version of that into the Switch 2 OS that kids and non-techy people can use easily. But beyond that, the Switch 2 is just a better Switch. </p><p> Boy, that’s nice, huh?

Yet, in 2025, I’m over the moon about Nintendo’s new console simply because it hasn’t been ruined in the pursuit of profits. It hasn’t been “improved” in the hopes of making the number go up. Business idiots didn’t cram it full of garbage nobody wants. That’s really nice. </p><p>When the Switch 2 was revealed, some complained that it was too safe. That the Switch 2 wasn’t innovative enough. And maybe that’s true, but I don’t really care because the Switch 2 is the rare tech product that doesn’t annoy me. $450 is a fair price to pay for an upgraded product that is actually better, faster, and not annoying to use. I’ll gladly pay that in 2025. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/mario-kart-world-switch-2-price-80-nintendo-direct-1851774262&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/mario-kart-world-switch-2-price-80-nintendo-direct-1851774262">Though $80 for a game is still wild, come on, Nintendo</a></span>. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/toy-battle-board-game-review-a-solid-strategy-game-for-two-players<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">At first glance, Toy Battle might look like a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/clash-royale">Clash Royale</a> knockoff, but there’s more in this toy box than meets the eye. This <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-2-player-board-games">two-player</a> battler delivers deceptively simple gameplay and lightning-fast matches, with eight unique game boards and strategic troop abilities that keep each round feeling fresh. If you can look past its playful aesthetic, Toy Battle offers some genuinely satisfying moments that players of all ages can enjoy.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">What's in the Box</h2><div catalogid="24fb6271-c059-4eda-b505-5253aa7e7288" id="221939"><div id="221939" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Toy Battle</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Toy Battle comes in a compact box designed to resemble a locking metal toybox, adding a playful touch right from the start. Inside, you'll find a short instruction manual (with a QR code for a video overview), a player aid sheet, and several thick punchboards containing all of the troop tiles. There isn’t much to punch out – just 48 total troops (24 blue and 24 red), with three copies each of the eight unique toy units you'll control during the game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Two high-quality wooden stands are included to keep your troops upright, organized, and hidden from your opponent during play. A small brown bag holds 16 medal markers used for scoring, and you’ll also find two simple-to-assemble storage boxes (one blue, one red) that help keep your troops separated and secure when the game is packed away.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Beneath everything are four double-sided game boards, each featuring a distinct terrain for a total of eight themed battlefields. These range from castles and cities above the clouds to volcanic jungles, cemeteries, and space stations. But they’re more than just cosmetic changes; each board has a unique layout and special bases that can be activated to trigger game-altering effects. Every square inch of the game's box is used efficiently, with everything fitting snugly back inside when playtime’s over.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Rules and How It Plays</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">The goal in Toy Battle is to be the first player to either conquer your opponent's headquarters or collect the required number of medals by controlling terrain. To achieve this, players take turns placing troops onto the battlefield, starting near their own headquarters and advancing along connected paths until one of the win conditions is met.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">To begin, players select one of the eight terrain maps. For your first game, the rules recommend playing on the Castle Field map as it features a symmetrical layout and straightforward special base effect. One player takes control of the blue troops, while the other commands the red. Medal markers are distributed based on icons shown on the map, and each player shuffles their troops into facedown stacks. The starting player draws three troops and places them on their rack, while the second player draws four.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Players perform one of two actions on their turn: either draw two troops from their reserve or place a single troop on the terrain. Drawing troops gives you more options to work with, but it also gives your opponent a chance to advance toward victory. When placing troops, you can claim an empty base on the board or cover one of your opponent’s troops if your unit’s power is higher. Balancing the need to maintain pressure with the need to keep your rack full is one of the core strategic dilemmas in Toy Battle.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>If you can look past its playful aesthetic, Toy Battle offers some genuinely satisfying moments that players of all ages can enjoy.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Each troop has a power level from one to seven and a unique effect that activates when played. For example, Skully, the 1-power unit, doesn’t offer much raw strength but lets you draw two additional troops, making it a valuable early-game play.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Other troops include Cap'n, the 2-power unit that allows you to play an extra troop during your turn; Jumbo, the 3-power unit that lets you discard one of your opponent’s adjacent troops; Hook, the 4-power unit that can be placed onto any base on the board to get behind enemy lines or disrupt your opponent's plans; XB-42, the 5-power unit that allows you to randomly discard a troop from your opponent's rack; and Star, the 6-power unit that lets you draw a troop from your reserve while putting a strong body on the board.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Roxy, the 7-cost unit, doesn't have any effect, but is the strongest standard troop in the game. Then there's Kwak, the joker unit that can be played on top of any troop but can also be covered by any other, making it both flexible and vulnerable.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While the troops are designed to resemble familiar children’s toys like green army men, dragons, and robots, I never really felt like I was waging an epic toy box war. Most of their abilities didn’t feel thematically appropriate, and they often came across more like generic meeples than distinct characters with charm.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are three copies of each troop in a player’s stack, but four are removed at random before the game begins. This adds bit of randomness and a layer of uncertainty that carries throughout the game as you try to deduce what you and your opponent might still have in reserve. Anticipating and playing around potential moves becomes a crucial skill in Toy Battle, creating constant micro-decisions that ultimately shape the outcome of the match.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Another key element to consider is the terrain you and your opponent are playing on. Each of the eight maps offers a unique layout, with multiple paths leading to your opponent’s headquarters, similar to a MOBA. Bases along these paths serve as spaces where troops can be deployed, and with only about five between headquarters, you'll be fighting for control almost immediately.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Most maps also feature special bases that trigger unique effects, like returning a troop to your rack, drawing from your reserve, or reclaiming a discarded unit. These hotly contested spaces can swing the momentum of a match if used wisely. Some boards introduce variety in other ways, such as an asymmetrical layout with an extra headquarters for one player to defend, or a central zone that nullifies all troop effects. These twists force you to rethink your approach and keep each match feeling distinct.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As mentioned earlier, reaching your opponent’s headquarters isn’t the only way to win. Each map has medal tokens scattered across both sides, appearing as single medals or grouped in twos or threes. If your troops control every base surrounding a medal or medal group, you claim it. Be the first to collect the required number for that terrain, and you win. This alternate victory condition makes for tense moments and forces you to adjust your strategy on the fly depending on the state of the board.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While Toy Battle doesn’t offer the layered complexity found in some other battlers and may not appeal to players seeking deeper strategy, its quick setup and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-best-quick-playing-board-games-in-2024">lightning-fast matches</a> make it a fun addition to any collection. It’s approachable for all ages, can be taught in minutes, and ideal for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-family-board-games">families</a> or <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-board-games-for-kids">younger players</a>. With most games wrapping up in about 10 minutes, it’s easy to play a few rounds and walk away feeling satisfied without committing your whole afternoon.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Where to Buy Toy Battle</h2><ul data-cy="list"><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/z3GGPR?object_uuid=aa8aa678-c61a-4223-95e7-a14b4cbf6194&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" data-aps-asin="B0DWT9J5L3" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Get it at Amazon</a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/Qbbbmo?object_uuid=aa8aa678-c61a-4223-95e7-a14b4cbf6194&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Get it at Walmart</a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/Qp77eg?object_uuid=aa8aa678-c61a-4223-95e7-a14b4cbf6194&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Get it at Asmodee</a></li></ul><h3 data-cy="title3">More Family-Friendly Board Games We Recommend</h3></div></section><div data-cy="caption"><p>Originally posted: </p><!-- --><p>Jun 12, 2025 5:54 pm</p></div><div data-cy="verdict"><h3 data-cy="title3">Verdict</h3><p data-cy="article-verdict-paragraph">Toy Battle is a swift, accessible two-player battler with deceptively simple gameplay.

Indeed, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/success-of-warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-changes-everything-dev-says-and-yes-there-are-ideas-for-space-marine-3"><u>Space Marine 2 has done so well it “changes everything” for Saber</u></a>, Chief Creative Officer Tim Willits told IGN soon after the game came out.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">As a result, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/space-marine-2-made-millions-for-games-workshop-now-its-on-the-hunt-for-the-next-big-warhammer-video-game">it was a big financial success for Warhammer 40,000 owner Games Workshop</a>. CEO Kevin Rountree has said it contributed significant royalty revenue to the tabletop company's business last year.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Focus and Saber surprised some Space Marine 2 fans when <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/warhammer-40000-space-marine-3-announced-development-officially-begins-at-saber-interactive">it announced Space Marine 3 was in development</a> back in March, half a year after the game came out. But given the huge sales you can see why the project was greenlit so soon.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Space Marine 2 has proven to be a transformative game for Saber," Matthew Karch, CEO of Saber Interactive, said at the time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"It is the culmination of everything we have learned about game development in our 25 years in the business. We are now starting to develop Space Marine 3, a game that carries with it tremendous expectations from our rapidly expanding fanbase. While we will continue to support and grow the Space Marine 2 universe over the coming years, we will take all our learnings and apply them to an even bigger and more spectacular game for the third installment. We view this as an opportunity to create a true love letter to the Warhammer 40.000 universe."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Still, Focus and Saber had to put out a statement reassuring players of its commitment to Space Marine 2, which is still working through its year one roadmap of content.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Without spoiling the Space Marine 2 campaign, it strongly suggests a continuation (<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-fans-have-a-good-idea-which-enemy-faction-theyll-fight-in-space-marine-3"><u>IGN has reported on the enemy faction we’ll probably see in Space Marine 3</u></a>).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In the shorter term, Space Marine 2 is due to get the Siege Update (Patch 8) very soon.
