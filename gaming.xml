              <p data-component="paragraph">In 2017, some former Telltale developers were working on a <em>Splinter Cell</em> sequel that eventually, due to Ubisoft’s focus on live-service games, morphed into the now-dead free-to-play FPS<em> XDefiant.</em></p> <p data-component="paragraph"><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-11-14/the-turbulent-seven-year-saga-behind-hit-game-dispatch?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc2MzE0MzM2NiwiZXhwIjoxNzYzNzQ4MTY2LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJUNVFBMDdHUEZIUlYwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.fNOncm0D1BfbWI9RAgwCB6j8SI8mW9RhRD76EEz1TYo&amp;leadSource=uverify%20wall">In a <em>Bloomberg</em> story published on November 14</a> about the development of the recently released narrative-focused superhero adventure game <em>Dispatch</em>, we learn a little bit about a previously unknown-to-the-public <em>Splinter Cell</em> game that was being developed by Ubisoft San Francisco around eight years ago.</p> <p data-component="paragraph">Adhoc Co-Founder Nick Herman told <em>Bloomberg</em> that in early 2017, he and a few colleagues left Telltale after working on <em>Tales from the Borderlands</em> and landed at Ubisoft San Francisco. They were tasked with developing a new entry in the tactical stealth franchise, <em>Splinter Cell.</em> At that point, it had been about four years since the last game, <a href="https://kotaku.com/splinter-cell-blacklist-the-kotaku-review-1126859452"><em>Blacklist</em>, had been released in 2013</a>.</p>

 <p data-component="paragraph">“I was so excited to be a part of this and help revitalize it, because it’s been dormant for a while,” Herman told the outlet. “And we thought we could tell a great story and do something the fans would love.”</p> <p data-component="paragraph">However, after working on the new <em>Splinter Cell</em> sequel for a few months, Ubisoft executives started disrupting development. This was when the publisher was becoming more and more focused on live-service games that could be updated for years and years, like <em>Rainbow Six Siege </em>and <em>The Division 2. </em>Ubisoft reportedly wanted all of its in-development games to include live-service elements and monetization, including the new <em>Splinter Cell.&nbsp;</em></p>

 <p data-component="paragraph">“We tried,” Herman told <em>Bloomberg</em>. “Let’s make a narrative [live-service] game. We were trying to make that make sense, and a lot of cool prototypes were made.” But it apparently became clear to those working on the doomed game that Ubisoft was no longer interested in <em>Splinter Cell.&nbsp;</em>According to<em> Bloomberg</em> and Herman, the project changed and evolved many times, and eventually became <a href="https://kotaku.com/ubisoft-xdefiant-shut-down-ending-call-of-duty-cod-june-1851712899"><em>XDefiant,</em> aka that short-lived live-service shooter Ubisoft killed back in June.&nbsp;</a></p> <p>“It was exciting to go to work for the first six months because we thought we were going to be able to make something really great,” Herman said. “And then you realize that all of the things you care about, they don’t anymore. It’s a common thing in games.”</p> <p>Ubisoft hasn’t completely given up on <em>Splinter Cell. </em><a href="https://kotaku.com/new-splinter-cell-trailer-netflix-deathwatch-chaos-theory-ending-john-wick-2000626077">There’s an animated series that recently arrived on Netflix</a> that I’m guessing you didn’t know about. And <a href="https://news.ubisoft.com/en-us/article/4adJLuhgYrPboHAPRfK7Oz/splinter-cell-remake-begins-development-at-ubisoft-toronto">in 2021, the company confirmed Ubisoft Toronto was developing a remake</a> of the first game. We’ve not heard much about that project since it was first revealed. Hopefully, it doesn’t morph into some <em>Call of Duty</em> clone.</p>

<p>More importantly, the company claimed that it "does not have any intention to hinder or invalidate legal third-party dock compatibility." It is unclear what Nintendo considers to be a "legal" dock.</p><p>When version 21.0.0 arrived on November 11, some Switch 2 owners took to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Switch/comments/1ou7lo8/psa_switch_2_v2100_disables_third_party_docks/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Reddit</a> and other forums to share their struggles with using third-party docks after the patch. Other users have noted that their docks remain functional, and manufacturers such as <a href="https://hagibis.bbscloud.com/info/570fc56f2e5c480cbda88a6638ebed89?csr=1" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Hagibis</a> and <a href="https://support.jemdogame.com/firmware_update_dock_20251112/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Jemdo</a> have since deployed firmware updates to their docks to ensure compatibility with the latest Switch patch.</p><p>Regardless of Nintendo's intention, the sample size of users who experienced issues with their third-party docks certainly demonstrates that the latest Switch firmware update had some sort of impact on compatibility. Based on Nintendo's statement, it doesn't appear that the company is eager to remedy the situation, and it may fall on the dock makers themselves to push out their own fixes.</p><p>Switch owners may own a third-party dock for various reasons, including the desire to have docks in multiple locations within their home or for portability. Unfortunately for third-party hardware makers, Nintendo made the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/report/695915/switch-2-usb-c-third-party-docks-dont-work-authentication-encryption" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Switch 2's USB-C port a lot more restrictive</a> and harder to work with.</p><p>Many third-party Switch 2 docks found online range from $20 to $50. In comparison, <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/nintendo-switch-2-dock-set-123791/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nintendo's official Switch 2 dock set</a>, which include the official dock, an ultra-high-speed HDMI cable, a USB-C cable, and an AC adapter, costs $125 USD.</p>

<p>Ubisoft was working on a new entry in the Splinter Cell franchise, but Ubisoft decided to cancel it before it was ever announced.</p>



<p>In a recent interview with Bloomberg’s Jason Schreier, AdHoc Studio co-founder Nick Herman spoke about how Dispatch came to be and an interesting situation that led to the studio’s formation.</p>







<p>Herman was hired in 2017 by Ubisoft, along two other AdHoc cofounders Pierre Shorette and Dennis Lenart, and moved to work in Ubisoft’s San Francisco office. Upon arrival, they were put on the new Splinter Cell project.</p>



<p><strong>“I was so excited to be a part of this and help revitalize it, because it’s been dormant for a while,”</strong> Herman <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-11-14/the-turbulent-seven-year-saga-behind-hit-game-dispatch?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc2MzE0MzM2NiwiZXhwIjoxNzYzNzQ4MTY2LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJUNVFBMDdHUEZIUlYwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.fNOncm0D1BfbWI9RAgwCB6j8SI8mW9RhRD76EEz1TYo&amp;leadSource=uverify%20wall">told Schreier</a>. <strong>“And we thought we could tell a great story and do something the fans would love.”</strong></p>











<p>Unfortunately, the game didn’t get very far. After just months of work, Ubisoft started making pivots on its plans. It seemed like the writing was on the wall for the game. </p>



<p>“<strong>It was exciting to go to work for the first six months because we thought we were going to be able to make something really great,” </strong>Herman said. <strong>“And then you realize that all of the things you care about, they don’t anymore. It’s a common thing in games.”</strong></p>







<p>Herman, Shorette, and Lenart would leave Ubisoft after the project was cancelled and form AdHoc Studio along with Michael Choung in 2018. </p>



<p>Despite no new game in the franchise since Splinter Cell: Blacklist in 2013, Splinter Cell isn’t dead. Ubisoft is currently working on a remake of the original game that, as of late 2024, was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/exclusive-update-on-splinter-cell-remakes-development/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">still planned for a 2026 release</a>. Since then, however, it’s been quite silent on its status. </p>



<p>Recently, Ubisoft has moved into a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-is-forming-a-new-subsidiary-with-tencent-valued-at-4-3-billion/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">partnership with Tencent</a>, started <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisofts-new-company-officially-launches-today/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a new subsidiary</a>, and even <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-delays-earnings-report-halts-share-trading/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">delayed reporting its earnings</a> just minutes before they were scheduled to release.</p>

Years of development and millions of dollars went into the game, only for it to fail at launch and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-shuts-down-concord-permanently-shutters-dev-firewalk-studios/1100-6527460/" data-ref-id="1100-6527460">get canceled by Sony weeks later</a>.

<p>Was due in November</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure data-uuid="7693829e5141b"><a title="Lollipop Chainsaw RePOP" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/7693829e5141b/lollipop-chainsaw-repop.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Dragami Games</em></figcaption></figure><p>Fans of extremely bloody, sugary sweet violence were likely excited to get their hands on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/lollipop-chainsaw-repop-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Lollipop Chainsaw RePOP - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition</a> later <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/lollipop-chainsaw-repop-is-getting-a-sweet-switch-2-edition-upgrade-this-november">this month</a>. Unfortunately, you'll have to wait a little bit longer, as Dragami Games have announced a last-minute delay. The game will now be launching in <strong>early 2026</strong>.</p>
<p>But there's actually a good reason for the delay this time around — "While the title was initially planned to be released as a digital-only version, we received many requests for a physical edition following the announcement" the developer states <a href="https://x.com/Dragami_Games/status/1989252238347567413">on social media</a>.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytC1rrCdi_XjA" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067tzuiwo&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>838k</span></a></p>
</div></figure></div>
<p>"In response, and with the cooperation of multiple publishing partners, we are now able to prepare physical releases for multiple regions." The delay is to allow both the digital and physical versions to release at the same time.</p>

<p>So, we think we can all wait just a few more months to get the game on a cartridge, right? At least, we assume it'll be a full physical release.</p>
<p>We hope the Switch 2 Edition improves some of our issues with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/lollipop_chainsaw_repop">Lollipop Chainsaw RePOP</a> on the Switch, which suffered from rough performance. It's not the <em>best</em> game in the world, but it's a cult hit with many, so <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/lollipop-chainsaw-repop">we were disappointed with the rerelease</a>.</p>

		<p>Amazon had dropped a new trailer for season two of Fallout, based on the Bethesda franchise of the same name.&nbsp; We get to see more Lucy (Ella Purnell) and The Ghoul (Walton Goggins) as they travel to&nbsp; New Vegas, plus our first look at two of the new additions to the cast,&nbsp; Macaulay Culkin and Kumail Nanjiani.</p>
<p>The Fallout Season 2 trailer also reveals Moisés Arias returns as Lucy’s brother Norm and it will be interesting to see where his story goes, as at the end of Season 1, he discovered the real purpose of the Vaults.<br>
Fan favourite Mr. House will join the show, played by Justin Theroux, Barb Howard, the Ghouls wife from his previous life, is also shown a long with other returning characters such as Woody Thomas (Zach Cherry) and Lucy’s dad, Overseer Hank MacLean who is played by Kyle MacLachlan.</p>
<p><iframe title="Fallout Season Two | Official Trailer | Prime Video" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dS6q36IyKpk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Amazon previously announced that Season 2 of Fallout will drop an episode a week, rather than all at once, which is how Season One arrived. The second season, which was commissioned just a week after the first had aired.</p>
<p>The logline for season two does not reveal anything,&nbsp; “The new season will pick up in the aftermath of season one’s epic finale and take audiences along for a journey through the wasteland of the Mojave to the post-apocalyptic city of New Vegas.”</p>

<p>If you missed the first series, then we highly recommend it. You<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/04/11/fallout-season-1/">&nbsp;can check out my review here.</a> Season 3 has already been commissioned, so the story will continue. The Fallout television series is canon within the franchise so Fallout 5, whenever that gets round to being made, may incorporate characters and locations from the show.</p>
<p>“Fallout is one of the greatest game series of all time,” said&nbsp; Jonathon Nolan during <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/07/02/fallout-tv-series-teased-by-amazon-studios-and-kilter-films/">the show’s 2020 announcement</a>. “Each chapter of this insanely imaginative story has cost us countless hours we could have spent with family and friends. So we’re incredibly excited to partner with Todd Howard and the rest of the brilliant lunatics at Bethesda to bring this massive, subversive, and darkly funny universe to life with Amazon Studios.”</p>
<p>The first episode of Fallout Season 2 will be released on Amazon Prime video on 17th December 2025, with a new episode following on the same day for the next seven weeks.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/escape-from-tarkov-1-0-launch-q-a-%E2%80%93-%E2%80%98we-are-aware-of-our-significance-and-we-have-very-big-plans%E2%80%99.1354159/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Saturday isn't usually a day of game releases, and yet it is the day that developer Battlestate Games <a href="https://wccftech.com/escape-from-tarkov-release-date-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">has chosen to release version 1.0 of its highly popular game Escape from Tarkov</a>. Tomorrow, the game will officially exit early access and become available for the first time <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3932890/Escape_from_Tarkov/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on Steam</a>, Valve's premier global PC gaming platform.</p>



<p>We first covered the game over nine years ago, <a href="https://wccftech.com/escape-tarkov-interview-truly-hardcore-first-person-shooter/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">with an interview conducted at Gamescom 2016</a>. The game then followed an unusual development pattern: Battlestate <a href="https://wccftech.com/escape-from-tarkov-closed-beta-start/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">soft-launched it with the Closed Beta</a>, which became available on July 28, 2017, granting access to all pre-order customers and dropping the Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA) so that players could freely discuss the game on the Internet.</p>



<p>Since then, the studio slowly but surely expanded and improved the game, which gained a large following of players and became the de facto ancestor of a new shooter subgenre: the extraction shooter, where players enter a zone, scavenge it for loot, and fight against AI and player-controlled enemies in a dangerous bid to extract with those precious resources intact.</p>



<p>This type of game is so popular nowadays that its mechanics are even spilling into other genres, as we're seeing with extraction RPGs like <a href="https://wccftech.com/project-pantheon-qa-a-post-apocalyptic-fantasy-extraction-arpg-from-the-makers-of-wolcen/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Project Pantheon</a> (now known as Gods, Death &amp; Reapers), <a href="https://wccftech.com/mistfall-hunter-is-a-dark-fantasy-soulslike-extraction-rpg-coming-to-pc-and-xbox/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mistfall Hunter</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/legacy-steel-sorcery-pvpve-extraction-arpg-gets-alpha-demo-for-steam-next-fest/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Legacy: Steel &amp; Sorcery</a>, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/blizzard-veteran-finds-funding-innsmouth-mysteries-lovecraft-co-op-extraction-rpg/">Innsmouth Mysteries</a>, just to name a few.</p>



<p>Still, Escape from Tarkov remains as alluring as ever with its hardcore, realistic, and uncompromising extraction military first-person shooter experience. With mere hours left separating us from the long-awaited 1.0 release, here's our exclusive chat with Game Director Nikita Buyanov, in which we discussed the road to launch, what's in it (and what's not), the studio's opinion on the burgeoning genre, and what's next for Escape from Tarkov.</p>



<figure><figcaption><em>The 1.0 release is, of course, a very large-scale update. It contains a massive amount of new content. The story alone is a huge part – players will finally get the chance to escape from Tarkov. If I'm not mistaken, preparing, developing, and integrating the release content took over 2 years. So yes – it's very large-scale.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>It's been over 8 years since you first released Escape from Tarkov to pre-order players. How would you describe this long journey with your community?</strong></p>



<p>This wasn't just a long journey; it's been a part of our lives—mine and everyone at the studio. We grew up ourselves, and along with us, an entire generation of players grew up. It's been a very interesting, exciting, and challenging journey.</p>



<p><strong>Were you aware that it would take such a long time to get the game to version 1.0, or did you expect to launch earlier?</strong></p>



<p>That's a very good question. Of course, we planned to release it sooner. But creating a game, especially one with almost a decade of background, is a very complex process. We faced numerous obstacles in the form of various subsystems; some things we rewrote from scratch, other things we were the first to do, things no one had ever done before us. I think we would have released Tarkov sooner if we could predict the future and knew what we would face. We knew what we were doing, but at times we didn't know how to do it.</p>



<p><strong>Escape from Tarkov is arguably the forefather of extraction shooters. How does it feel to see it gain such popularity, and what do you think about the genre's latest success, <a href="https://wccftech.com/arc-raiders-has-sold-4-million-units-nexons-most-successful-global-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Embark's ARC Raiders</a>?</strong></p>



<p>We are aware of our significance: we managed to create not just a game, but an entire subgenre – the extraction shooter. And when we see games that find their audience, like ARC Raiders, which you mentioned, we are only happy about it. After all, the more good games, the better. Unfortunately, not everyone views us the same way and sees us as a competitor; everyone strives to proclaim themselves the "Tarkov killer" and tries to "knock Tarkov off its pedestal." We never had the goal of climbing onto that pedestal. We are simply making a game. A game that we ourselves enjoy, and which, in its uniqueness, is suited specifically for hardcore players. That's all.</p>



<p><strong>Will the 1.0 release's content be as substantial as previous large updates (e.g., Reserve or Streets)?</strong></p>



<p>The 1.0 release is, of course, a very large-scale update. It contains a massive amount of new content. The story alone is a huge part – players will finally get the chance to escape from Tarkov. If I'm not mistaken, preparing, developing, and integrating the release content took over 2 years. So yes – it's very large-scale.</p>



<p><strong>Will there be a heat map or death cam feature in version 1.0?</strong></p>



<p>No, these features will not be in the release version, but we still plan to implement them in the future.</p>



<p><strong>What’s the roadmap for expansions or content updates after 1.0?</strong></p>



<p>The first DLC players can expect after release is "Scav Life." Players will dive into the story of the Scavs and see them from a different perspective. They will have their own little Hideout, as well as progression opportunities. In fact, we have a very broad planning horizon – there will be new locations and major events. Tarkov hasn't been fully explored and still holds many secrets.</p>



<p><strong>Where do you think the game is when it comes to anti-cheat measures? Are you looking to make further enhancements?</strong></p>



<p>The release version carries many changes aimed directly at combating cheaters. We have done a tremendous amount of work in this area and sincerely hope that things will be good on this front. Nevertheless, we certainly don't plan to stop here and will continue to improve our anti-cheat mechanics. We have a very large department at the studio working exclusively on this problem.</p>



<p><strong>What improvements will be made to server stability and matchmaking?</strong></p>



<p>I must point out that server stability isn't 100% within our control. However, the aspects that are our responsibility, including matchmaking, have undergone many changes, and we expect significant improvement.</p>



<p><strong>Will there be further improvements in Quality of Life (QoL) for usability and user interface?</strong></p>



<p>Yes, this is also one of the important points that has our attention. We will continue to improve Quality of Life (QoL) and the User Interface (UI), both at release and after it.</p>



<figure><figcaption><em>Yes, we are considering the possibility of porting the game to consoles. I think when we start working on it, we will implement full controller support. It's a very serious and interesting game design challenge – to create comfortable controls while accounting for all of Tarkov's unique mechanics.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>How are the narrative/story modes progressing? Is there anything you can share about that?</strong></p>



<p>The story consists of a chain of story quests. A clear storyline. It's not a narrative mode in the traditional sense. Answering your question, I can only say that players will finally have the opportunity to thoroughly understand what happened to the city and to escape from Tarkov.</p>



<p><strong>Are there plans to improve AI behavior, especially for Scavs and bosses?</strong></p>



<p>Of course, the Black Division alone is a significant addition. But the AI and the game as a whole have undergone a huge number of changes.</p>



<p><strong>Escape from Tarkov does not currently support controllers; however, a substantial number of PC players regularly utilize this control system in other games. Are you planning to add it in the future? Also, are you thinking about console ports?</strong></p>



<p>Yes, we are considering the possibility of porting the game to consoles. I think when we start working on it, we will implement full controller support. It's a very serious and interesting game design challenge – to create comfortable controls while accounting for all of Tarkov's unique mechanics.</p>



<p><strong>What else does the future hold for Battlestate Games now that a decade-long project is concluding?</strong></p>



<p>We have very big plans. We plan to expand and do even more – to continue developing and deepening Tarkov, and to expand the universe. You will all see it soon.</p>



<p><strong>Thank you for your time.</strong></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer Alex Massé has announced that upcoming&nbsp;<em>Sims</em>-style indie life sim&nbsp;<em>Paralives&nbsp;</em>is being delayed, and it's a pretty hefty delay at that, so you won't be playing this one for a while, unfortunately.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/ParalivesGame/status/1989347579856113871" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">message</a> on social media, Massé announces that&nbsp;<em>Paralives&nbsp;</em>will now be launching on May 25th next year, having been previously <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/paralives-december-early-access-release-date" rel="nofollow">slated for an Early Access release next month</a>.</p>

<p>Massé says that although the&nbsp;<em>Paralives&nbsp;</em>team was confident the game would be ready for December, expanding playtesting beyond the initial player base showed that the game "isn't up to the standard [the team] wanted it to meet for release".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/paralives-delayed-early-access-workout.jpg?itok=_3Is5cSx 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/paralives-delayed-early-access-workout.jpg?itok=gx47yT4K 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Paralives&nbsp;</em>won't be launching in December after all.</figcaption></figure><p>According to Massé, those who have tried out&nbsp;<em>Paralives&nbsp;</em>are still enjoying the "flexibility and customization" of the game's Paramaker and Build Modes, but the Live Mode is still playing host to "impactful bugs", and on top of that, there's "a lack of activities" in&nbsp;<em>Paralives</em>' main town.</p>

<p>Massé goes on to explain that life sims of this kind, which he calls "doll-house life simulation" games (among which games like&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/inzoi-release-date-delayed" rel="nofollow">Krafton's&nbsp;<em>inZoi</em></a><em>&nbsp;</em>and the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/paradox-profits-life-by-you-canceled" rel="nofollow">now-canceled&nbsp;</a><em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/paradox-profits-life-by-you-canceled" rel="nofollow">Life by You</a>&nbsp;</em>mingle), are "really three games in one": a building game, a character creator, and a simulation.</p>

<p>The build mode and character creator are in a place Massé and his team are happy with, but the simulation element requires "a bit more time" for polish, ensuring that&nbsp;<em>Paralives&nbsp;</em>offers "a great first experience" for those who decide to check it out.</p>

<p>It's not all bad news, though; on November 25th, a 45-minute "uninterrupted Live mode gameplay" stream will be happening on the&nbsp;<em>Paralives&nbsp;</em>YouTube channel, so more info is on the way.</p>




<p>If you want to keep up with&nbsp;<em>Paralives&nbsp;</em>as development continues ahead of its new May Early Access release date, you can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1118520/Paralives/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">wishlist the game on Steam</a> right now.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Stop me if you’ve heard this one before: The latest <em>Call of Duty</em> game seems to contain AI-generated art that doesn’t look very good, and people aren’t happy about it. This time, it’s the newly released <a href="https://kotaku.com/cod-blops-7-campaign-coop-always-online-pause-co-op-xp-challenges-2000644358"><em>Black Ops 7.</em></a></p> <p>On November 14, <em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</em> launched across consoles and PC. And within a few hours, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CODBlackOps7/comments/1owqr38/so_these_calling_cards_are_definitely_ai/">players online were sharing screenshots of artwork</a> within the game that they believe is AI-generated slop. And it’s hard not to agree.</p> <p><a href="https://x.com/Kumesicles/status/1988984517823197541">Looking at some of this artwork</a>, including in-game player banners, I notice the telltale signs of AI imagery, including at least one cartoon character that appears to have <a href="https://x.com/Kumesicles/status/1989327996126126344">six fingers</a>. Eyelines also don’t match up, and some objects seem vaguely defined. And almost all of it just looks really bland. Keep in mind, these are rewards you get for completing challenges, which makes it even more depressing; gee, thanks, some machine-vomited “art.”</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Almost every single campaign and endgame calling card in bo7 is like Grok Ai generated images its so insane <a href="https://t.co/5bCGNJQmgn">pic.twitter.com/5bCGNJQmgn</a></p> <p>— Kume (@Kumesicles) <a href="https://twitter.com/Kumesicles/status/1988984517823197541?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 13, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>Other players have shared screenshots of what looks like AI-generated artwork within<em> Black Ops 7’s</em> campaign, which this year is online-only and designed around multiplayer. Of course, we can’t know for sure which pieces of art in the latest<em> Call of Duty</em> were created by humans, which were generated by a machine, and which are a combo, with humans touching up crappy generated imagery.</p>

 <p>But we do know for a fact that <em>Black Ops 7</em> has AI art in it, as confirmed by the game’s Steam store page: “Our team uses generative AI tools to help develop some in-game assets.” This is the same disclaimer found on <a href="https://kotaku.com/black-ops-6-ai-calling-card-loading-screen-blops-6-cod-1851766313"><em>Black Ops 6′</em>s store page, which was added in February</a>.</p>

 <p><em>Kotaku</em> contacted Activision about the AI art in <em>Black Ops 7 </em>and was sent this statement:</p> <blockquote><p>“Like so many around the world, we use a variety of digital tools, including AI tools, to empower and support our teams to create the best gaming experiences possible for our players. Our creative process continues to be led by the talented individuals in our studios.”</p></blockquote> <h2><em>Black Ops 7</em> and <em>Black Ops 6</em> both use AI art</h2> <p>If that sounds familiar, it’s because this is similar to what Activision and Treyarch said about <em>Black Ops 6</em> earlier this year, following months of players accusing the devs of using AI slop. In an interview with <em>IGN</em> in August, <a href="https://kotaku.com/black-ops-7-generative-ai-call-duty-gamescom-2025-slop-2000618833">Treyarch associate creative director Miles Leslie talked about using AI art</a> in <em>Black Ops 7.</em></p>

 <p>The developer claimed that “everything that goes into the game is touched by the team a hundred percent,” but did admit that AI tools are used to “help.” As to why some clearly AI-generated art that was seemingly not fixed up by a human slipped into <em>Black Ops 6,</em> Leslie told <em>IGN</em> it was an “accident.”</p> <p data-cy="paragraph">“That was never the intention,” said Leslie. “We’ve come out and been very clear that we use these as tools to help the team, but they do not replace any of the fantastic team members we have that are doing the final touches and building that content to put it in the game. So everything you play: human-created and touched. AI tools in the world we live in: it’s how do we streamline it? That’s really the goal. Not replace, but streamline.”</p> <p data-cy="paragraph">And with players discovering bland AI-generated images in <em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</em> and Activision openly confirming it and embracing it, it seems this is&nbsp;just how it works now, I guess.</p>

              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-pokopia-animal-crossing-switch-2-nintendo-direct-2000625331"><i><span>Pokémon Pokopia</span></i></a> <span>is Omega Force’s swing at a cute and cozy </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>life sim in the vein of </span><i><span>Animal Crossing </span></i><span>or </span><i><span>Stardew Valley</span></i><span>. You play as a Ditto that transforms into a human and helps cultivate a new home for the local Pokémon wildlife, and though it’s a little unnerving seeing the beady-eyed human running around, it seems like a fun enough premise to support </span><i><span>Pokopia</span></i><span>’s life-sim gameplay. However, the more we see of the game, the more it seems like there might be a dark truth lurking beneath the surface, and fans are running wild with theories.</span></p> <p><span>Though it’s unclear how the </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>world may have gotten to this point, the prevailing theory is that the world of </span><i><span>Pokopia </span></i><span>may take place in some kind of post-apocalyptic timeline where humans and Pokémon have been separated for many years after some kind of disaster. There are clues hinting at this possibility dating as far back as the original reveal trailer from September. Ditto is shown escaping its Poké Ball in a cave that looks like it was, at one point, occupied by its trainer. The ‘mon looks at a Pokédex on the ground that is covered in dirt, and transforms into the trainer seen in a photo on the device. The fact that the dex has clearly been exposed to the elements for some time is concerning on its own, but there are more hints that something is amiss in </span><i><span>Pokopia</span></i><span>’s world than that.</span></p>

 <p><span>Yesterday, Nintendo released an extended </span><i><span>Pokopia </span></i><span>trailer that revealed a few new Pokémon variants, all of which seem to reflect the passage of time and lack of human interaction. A Snorlax is shown covered in moss, as if having slept long enough for nature to have overgrown its massive body. A Smeargle in the game is covered in paint, as if it has been painting without stopping or cleaning itself up. Then, there’s the biggest surprise: a white Pikachu named Peakychu who seems to be sickly, or even ghost-like. Could she be a specter of a long-dead Pikachu? Perhaps.</span></p>

  <p><span>The most explicit confirmation we get that humanity has been gone for a while is in Professor Tangrowth. This vine-covered Pokémon appears to be greying a bit and wears a broken TM machine like a doctor’s head mirror, as if it scavenged it in the rubble. In the trailer, we see Tangrowth tell Ditto that humans and Pokémon once lived in this place, but now that its buildings are destroyed and plants withered, he hasn’t seen anyone else in “quite some time.” He says this as he’s literally rummaging through the remains of what looks like a Pokémon Center that is now crumbled and covered in overgrowth. Whatever happened here that drove people and Pokémon away happened a long time ago. Some fans point out that what we see of the town’s layout looks similar to that of </span><a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@slantedgaming/video/7572354779658161463"><span>Fuchsia City</span></a><span> from </span><i><span>Red </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Blue</span></i><span>, and given that </span><i><span>Pokopia </span></i><span>seems to take place near a collection of islands, it’s not out of the question that this is a post-disaster version of the coastal city.</span></p> <p><span>Whatever is going on, it’s clear that something terrible happened to this place that we’ll be sprucing up in </span><i><span>Pokopia</span></i><span>. </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>loves to delve into dark, life-or-death situations from time to time; I’m just surprised it might be doing so in its foray into the genre that’s supposed to be about feel-good vibes. We’ll know more when the game comes to Switch 2 on March 5.</span></p>

<p>Activision has responded to claims regarding the use of generative AI to create calling cards in Call of Duty: Black Ops 7.</p>



<p>The response comes in the form of an email statement sent to Insider Gaming by an Activision spokesperson. In the statement, which you can read below, the company says that it uses a “variety” of tools, “including AI tools” for their development.</p>







<p><strong>“Like so many around the world, we use a variety of digital tools, including AI tools, to empower and support our teams to create the best gaming experiences possible for our players,”</strong> the statement reads, which was first given to <a href="https://xboxera.com/2025/11/14/activision-responds-on-genai-use-in-black-ops-7/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Xbox Era</a> before the rep responded to Insider Gaming’s request. <strong>“Our creative process continues to be led by the talented individuals in our studios.”</strong></p>



<p>Insider Gaming has reached out for more specific clarification as to what assets were generated by AI. Should that get a response, it will be published on Insider-Gaming.com and in the new <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/insider-gaming-mobile-app-membership-tiers/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming App</a>.</p>

Not only do you get $50-$70 off in instant discounts ($249 for the 128GB model and $329 for the 256GB model), you also get a bonus $50 Best Buy gift card with your purchase. That's basically getting a Quest for as low as $199. This is the best deal I've seen this year on a Quest 3S headset with warranty. Recently we've seen deals on refurbished models, but in this case the advantage of buying new is that you also get a couple of free games.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Note: </strong>The 128GB model includes two games, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/batman-arkham-shadow-review-meta-quest-3">Batman: Arkham Shadow</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-walking-dead-saints-and-sinners-review">The Walking Dead: Saints and Sinners</a>.

However, whereas the Quest 3 has been updated with a new pancake lens design, the Quest 3S retains the Fresnel optics of the Quest 2. Although obviously not as good as the Quest 3, the Quest 3S still very much offers an immersive visual experience that is sure to impress. I myself logged in hundreds of hours on the Quest 2 before I moved on to the Quest 3. For newcomers who want to try out VR gaming without investing tons of money, of for people who want to give this as a gift to someone who's never tried VR, I would recommend the Quest 3S over the Quest, especially at this price.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>TL;DR Quest 3S vs Quest 3:</strong></p><ul data-cy="list"><li><strong>Same </strong>Snapdragon XR2 Gen 2 processor</li><li><strong>Same </strong>Touch Plus controllers</li><li><strong>Same </strong>120Hz refresh rate</li><li><strong>Same </strong>Mixed reality passthrough functionality</li><li><strong>Same</strong> tetherless and tethered functionality</li><li>Quest 3 has <strong>sharper </strong>resolution (2064x2208 vs 1832x1920)</li><li>Quest 3 has <strong>better </strong>lens array (pancake vs fresnel)</li><li>Quest 3 has <strong>lower </strong>FOV (104°/96° vs 96°/90°)</li><li>Quest 3 has <strong>higher </strong>storage capacity (512GB vs 128GB)</li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Eric Song is the IGN commerce manager in charge of finding the best gaming and tech deals every day.

                <p>Activision has once again confirmed that AI tools were used in the development of Call of Duty: Black Ops 7, which is in keeping with tradition for the franchise, as Black Ops 6 utilized AI tools as well. In a statement, Activision said the creative process is handled by humans, with AI tools helping out. Back in August, Activision explained that developers working on Black Ops 7 used generative AI, but <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-dev-embraces-ai-but-not-to-replace-humans/1100-6534113/" data-ref-id="1100-6534113">"none of that goes in-game."</a></p><p>"Like so many around the world, we use a variety of digital tools, including AI tools, to empower and support our teams to create the best gaming experiences possible for our players. Our creative process continues to be led by the talented individuals in our studios," the company said.</p><p>Black Ops 7 launched today, November 14, and people quickly noticed that a number of Calling Cards that appear to use the "Ghibli-style" anime look, with <a href="https://frvr.com/blog/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-is-littered-with-ai-art-slop-because-your-70-means-nothing-anymore/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">people theorizing</a> that Activision used AI to create these images.</p><p>The <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3606480/Call_of_Duty_Black_Ops_7/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Black Ops 7 Steam page</a> discloses that, "Our team uses generative AI tools to help develop some in-game assets." The <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2933620/Call_of_Duty_Black_Ops_6/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">same exact language</a> is featured on Black Ops 6's Steam page. Activision has not clarified exactly what content in Black Ops 7 was made with the help of AI tools.</p><h2><strong>Call of Duty's past use of AI</strong></h2><p>An anonymous source within Activision <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/ai-is-already-taking-jobs-in-the-video-game-industry/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">told Wired in 2024</a> concept artists working on Call of Duty were "forced to use AI to aid in their work." The report added that "a lot of 2D artists" got laid off in early 2024 as part of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-cuts-650-more-gaming-jobs-but-no-studios-closed-or-games-canceled/1100-6526439/" data-ref-id="1100-6526439">Microsoft's wider job cuts</a>, though whether or not this had anything to do with AI is unknown.</p><p>Activision has said its plan for AI tools is to use them to help "streamline" game development and not replace humans.</p><p>If content created at least in part by generative AI tools has made its way into past Call of Duty games, that was "by accident," Treyarch's Miles Leslie said. He may be referring to the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-uses-generative-ai-for-some-content-activision-admits/1100-6529691/" data-ref-id="1100-6529691">multiple instances of AI-generated content in Call of Duty that fans have spotted over the years.</a></p><p>Leslie also stressed that Treyarch's use of AI tools is for efforts that "help the team" but not as a means to "replace any of the fantastic team members" who are building content for Call of Duty.</p><h2><strong>What other developers think of AI</strong></h2><p>A survey of game developers globally found that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/study-finds-majority-of-game-dev-companies-use-generative-ai-already-despite-worker-concerns/1100-6528919/" data-ref-id="1100-6528919">a majority of studios are using AI technologies to build games, despite concerns from workers.</a> Recently, Embark's popular PvPvE game Arc Raiders caused a stir in some circles <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/arc-raiders-sparks-debate-over-ai-voice-acting-in-games/1100-6536146/" data-ref-id="1100-6536146">regarding its use of AI voice lines.</a> Call of Duty's main competitor in the FPS space, Battlefield, returned this year with Battlefield 6, and the developers <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/genai-is-very-seducing-battlefield-6-boss-says/1100-6535356/" data-ref-id="1100-6535356">did not use generative AI.</a> However, a top Battlefield boss said EA's development teams use generative AI in the early development cycle, and the tools are <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/genai-is-very-seducing-battlefield-6-boss-says/1100-6535356/" data-ref-id="1100-6535356">"very seducing."</a></p><p>AI has been a controversial topic in video games and beyond, in part over fears about job losses. Electronic Arts CEO Andrew Wilson has said the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-ceo-on-how-ai-will-impact-video-games-and-the-people-who-make-them/1100-6513969/" data-ref-id="1100-6513969">rise in AI will lead to job losses in the short term</a> but will ultimately create more jobs total, just like what happened with previous labor revolutions.</p><p>Microsoft recently laid off thousands, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/all-the-xbox-games-cancelled-and-studios-closed-in-microsofts-latest-mass-layoffs/2900-6726/" data-ref-id="2900-6726">including deep cuts at Xbox</a>. One affected studio was Candy Crush developer King, with some affected staff saying <a href="https://mobilegamer.biz/laid-off-king-staff-set-to-be-replaced-by-the-ai-tools-they-helped-build-say-sources/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">they were replaced by the AI tools they helped design.</a></p><p>Black Ops 7 is out now for PS5, PS4, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, and PC. It's also playable via Xbox Game Pass, and you don't have to pay the new, higher rate, as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-game-pass-ultimate-sign-up-best-deal-available-now/1100-6535504/" data-ref-id="1100-6535504">most major retailers have not adopted Microsoft's 50% Game Pass price hike.</a></p><p>For more, check out GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-review/1900-6418441/" data-ref-id="1900-6418441">Black Ops 7 campaign review</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-tips-for-multiplayer/2900-7104/" data-ref-id="2900-7104">tips for multiplayer</a> in the gallery below.</p>

      <p>On this week's Aftermath Hours, Chris, Riley, and Gita raise our heads above the water of Aftermath’s <a href="https://aftermath.site/aftermath-relaunch-announcement/" rel="noreferrer">relaunched website</a> to talk, excitingly, about things that aren’t relaunching a website. To start, Chris and Gita talk about the movie <em>Bugonia</em>, a remake of 2003’s <em>Save the Green Planet</em>. We talk about how it’s different from the original, for better and worse, and what it says about class, society, and whether or not humanity is a failed experiment.</p><p>Then we talk about <em>Breaking Bad</em> creator Vince Gilligan’s new Apple TV show <a href="https://aftermath.site/pluribus-is-an-apocalypse-story-for-people-who-go-to-therapy/" rel="noreferrer"><em>Pluribus</em></a><em>.</em> We’re a bit divided on it, with some of us liking the tough exterior of its main character and others not quite sold yet. We discuss where we hope the show goes–no “Carol learns to love,” please!--and, if the point of art is to communicate with others, whether or not art can exist in the show’s world.</p><p>Last, Chris pitches us all on how great <em>Lumines Arise </em>is before we move on to the mailbag, where we appreciate the newly-announced <a href="https://aftermath.site/steam-machine-steam-frame-steam-controller-good-choices/" rel="noreferrer">Steam Machine</a>, discuss what games it should launch with, and talk about where we find a respite from staring at the news all day. </p><p>You can find this week's episode below and on <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/7qtlX6MNeEoyNuHBU0chUJ?si=a2f12b75911f43cb&amp;ref=aftermath.site">Spotify</a>, <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/aftermath-hours/id1727407094?ref=aftermath.site">Apple</a>, or wherever else you prefer to listen to podcasts.

<p>Manufacturers are working on updates to their docks</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure data-uuid="63d4585372042"><a title="Nintendo Switch 2 with S3 MAX TV Dock Station by Antank" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/63d4585372042/nintendo-switch-2-with-s3-max-tv-dock-station-by-antank.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Gavin Lane / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Following reports that some Switch 2 owners are having issues with third-party docks, Nintendo has addressed the issue.</p>
<p>In a response to <a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/video-games/nintendo/nintendo-says-it-has-no-intention-of-blocking-third-party-switch-2-docks-following-firmware-update-that-stopped-them-from-working-accessory-makers-scramble-to-deploy-workaround">Tom's Hardware</a> and <a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-just-blocked-third-party-switch-2-docks-and-it-sucks-2000644081">Kotaku</a>, a representative told the outlets that "Nintendo does not have any intention to hinder or invalidate legal third-party dock compatibility."</p>
<p>The issue of third-party compatibility <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Switch/comments/1ou7lo8/psa_switch_2_v2100_disables_third_party_docks/?utm_source=embedv2&amp;utm_medium=post_embed&amp;utm_content=post_body&amp;embed_host_url=https://www.tomshardware.com/video-games/nintendo/nintendo-says-it-has-no-intention-of-blocking-third-party-switch-2-docks-following-firmware-update-that-stopped-them-from-working-accessory-makers-scramble-to-deploy-workaround">cropped up earlier this week</a> after the Nintendo Switch 2 Version 21.0.0 update dropped. Many who have updated their consoles to the latest version have found that their third-party docks are no longer working with the console.</p>
<p>Some have even said that the official Switch 2 dock also stopped working after the update, but a quick restart has fixed this.</p>
<p>While not all third-party docks are affected, and some manufacturers have managed to put out hotfixes, it seems like the issues caused by the latest update are completely unintentional. Still, some manufacturers are suggesting Switch 2 owners to hold off on updating their console <em>until</em> they've managed to get a fix going.</p>

<p>"Nintendo Switch 2 outputs audiovisuals once it detects that it is docked into a Nintendo Switch 2 Dock," the representative explained, reiterating that the original Switch works similarly.</p>
<p>The Switch 2 dock situation has been a little tenuous in the early months of the console's life. Reports from July this year suggest that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/switch-2-usb-c-chip-might-be-breaking-compatibility-with-third-party-docks">the USB-C chip may be responsible</a> for some other compatibility issues. These issues are unrelated to the latest update.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>There’s been a very different tone to the games news this week, with the juggernaut of Call of Duty feeling like it’s lost a step in the face of some serious competition. Battlefield 6 is out there doing a straight up war shooter, Arc Raiders has made an extraction shooter love-in, and now here’s Black Ops 7, where there’s just a baffling direction for the campaign.</p>
<p>It takes some of the psychological mish-mash of Black Ops 3’s story, which people hated back in the day, the open world missions of Modern Warfare III, which people hated a couple years ago, practically makes co-op mandatory, and then has an Endgame post-campaign thing that will have to compete for attention with both the main Zombies mode and Dead Ops Arcade. It’s barmy, especially compared to the strengths of last year’s game.</p>
<p>The multiplayer does feel pretty good, though, which is the bulk of what people will play.</p>

<p><strong>Aran</strong> chimed in first, having played Forestrike and Umami for review. You’ll have to wait for the latter, but barring some snags, he enjoyed the puzzle-like take on the martial arts brawler in Forestrike.</p>

<p>As we continue through the busy season, <strong>Jim’s</strong> had to put Battlefield 6 on the back burner. He picked up a copy of Metal Gear Solid Delta in time for the Fox Hunt multiplayer, which is “a surprisingly competent online shooter”, and I dragged him into the Black Ops 7 single player with me, but in the main he’s “swapped body armour and boot laces for a fresh white toga for Anno 117: Pax Romana – it’s a series I’ve always been interested in playing but never got around to biting the bullet. Thoroughly enjoying my time as a governor in Ancient Rome, crafting city districts that not only perform well but look fab.”</p>

<p>Another conscript for Black Ops 7 was <strong>Miguel</strong>, who was about as baffled by some of the design choices as I was. Much clearer was playing some time with Tekken 8 and having fun with the King vs. Armour King matches. He’s also played the Atelier Ryza Deluxe trilogy pack, and went delved into his “niche weird Japanese action game” catalogue for D3 Publisher’s 2020 anime-girl-zombie-fighting action game OneeChanbara Origin. Sounds about right!</p>
<p><strong>Laura</strong> has continued to juggle Jurassic World Evolution 3 and Silent Hill 2 remake, getting some tonal whiplash from creepy nurses trying to kill her and being a proud park-building surrogate mum when the Megalodons brought a baby Megalodon into the world. Bless ’em!</p>
<p>Another genre juggler was <strong>Steve</strong>, going between the new SpongeBob SquarePants game and the classic horror of Tormented Souls 2, “which has been delayed somewhat after some bad ammo management put me in an impossible situation – what’s known in the trade as ‘Code Veronica-ing yourself’.” He’s also been a bit disappointed by the Sacred 2 Remaster.</p>

<p><strong>Ade</strong> has had the “fifty-something runs” which sound nasty until you realise he’s talking about Hades 2, where he reckons he’s nearing the end credits and would like to recommend it very highly.</p>
<p>And finally, <strong>Tuffcub</strong> played more Arc Raiders, “which is a lovely cuddly hug that reminds that despite how rubbish the world is, there are decent people in it.”</p>
<p>Now then, what have you played?</p>

              <p><i><span>Concord</span></i><span>’s shutdown was one of the highest-profile failures in not just video games, </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/concord-sony-biggest-flop-failure-box-office-1851676475"><span>but all of entertainment last year</span></a><span>. Sony </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/concord-shutting-down-closing-servers-refunds-ps5-1851638566"><span>pulled the plug</span></a><span> on its </span><i><span>Guardians of the Galaxy</span></i><span>-esque hero shooter days after its PS5 and PC launch failed to bring in players, and then subsequently </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/concord-firewalk-studios-relaunch-ps5-sony-playstation-1851652811"><span>shut down its developer, Firewalk Studios</span></a><span>. It was a highly publicized mess of mismanagement and callous corporate calculus, and it was also a damn shame because the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/concord-ps5-toxic-haters-heroes-shutdown-1851646309"><span>game was actually pretty alright</span></a><span>. Although the game seemed lost to time, some fans have taken it upon themselves to try and bring it back with fan-made servers, so if you wanted to see what all the fuss was about, you may have the chance.</span></p> <p><span>A group of fan modders has been working to rebuild </span><i><span>Concord</span></i><span>’s backend and create new servers (thanks, </span><a href="https://thegamepost.com/sony-concord-playable-again-custom-servers/"><i><span>TheGamePost</span></i></a><span>), and have officially played a match of the game once thought lost to time.&nbsp;</span></p>  <p><span>Red, one of the modders leading the project alongside Real, open_wizard, and Gwog, posted an update on Discord letting folks know the group had managed to play a match, though there are still a lot of bugs to iron out before they’re ready to open it up to more players.</span></p> <blockquote><p><span>After a long time of reverse engineering &amp; server development, we just managed to play a match of </span><i><span>Concord</span></i><span>! This is the match I played with open_wizard (don’t mind my horrible aim, I spend so much time reverse engineering that I no longer have the time to actually play games)</span></p> <p><span>The project is still WIP, it’s playable, but buggy. Once our servers are fully set up, we’ll begin doing some private playtesting, if anyone here wants to join those playtests, let me know (include what region/time zone you are in for convenience).</span></p></blockquote> <p><span>I still consider </span><i><span>Concord</span></i><span>’s fate</span> <span>to be a consequence of Sony’s terrible fumbling of its ill-advised live service pivot, but it’s always a bad thing when games are wiped from existence by their owners. A lot of people worked hard on </span><i><span>Concord</span></i><span>, and it deserves the dignity of being playable, even if Sony isn’t supporting it. So shoutout to fans for picking up the torch.</span></p>

<p><strong>Update: </strong>Activision has issued the following statement to Insider Gaming.</p>



<blockquote>
<p><em>Like so many around the world, we use a variety of digital tools, including AI tools, to empower and support our teams to create the best gaming experiences possible for our players. Our creative process continues to be led by the talented individuals in our studios.</em></p>
</blockquote>







<hr>



<p><strong>Original: </strong>Activision has been known to use generative AI in Call of Duty in the past, but now there are accusations of it being used in a new way within Call of Duty: Black Ops 7.</p>



<p>Many have taken to social media to show examples of what looks to be generative AI art in Black Ops 7 calling cards.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-possibly-ai-in-black-ops-7">What Is Possibly AI In Black Ops 7?</h2>



<p>First shared by <a href="https://x.com/Kumesicles/status/1988982194916999619" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Kume on Twitter</a>, the ones being called out specifically come from challenges like “Over Here Buddy”, “Peekaboo”, “Reeled In”, and more. The cards in question use Studio Ghibli art style, which has been easy to generate in most AI art programs. </p>



<p>The use of AI is disclosed on the game’s <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3606480/Call_of_Duty_Black_Ops_7/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Steam store page</a>. However, it doesn’t say what was done. Instead, it simply reads, “Our team uses generative AI tools to help develop some in game assets.” So, seeing things like calling cards be, possibly, the work of AI shouldn’t come as <a href="https://x.com/MikeStrawMedia/status/1865107470751834402" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">much of a surprise</a>. That said, it still might not sit well with players. </p>



<figure></figure>







<p>Insider Gaming has reached out to Activision for comment on the claims. As of publishing, no response has been received, but should one come, it will be added to this story.</p>



<p>If that doesn’t bother you, Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/visit/black-ops-7-loaded-xbox-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">is available now</a> for <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/visit/black-ops-7-amazon-us-ps5/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PlayStation 5</a>, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, and PC.  </p>

                <p>Epic Games is gearing up for its biggest shake-up to Fortnite Creative since the introduction of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/epic-announces-unreal-editor-for-fortnite-arriving-next-week/1100-6512398/" data-ref-id="1100-6512398">Unreal Editor for Fortnite</a>. Soon, Epic will allow developers who use UEFN to make Fortnite Creative modes, or "islands," to sell in-game items using V-Bucks, the game's real-money currency.</p><p dir="ltr">The news, which Epic announced during the Veteran's Day holiday in the US, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FortniteCreative/comments/1ouht3b/ive_got_a_feeling_this_could_ruin_fortnite/" rel="nofollow ">was not met with much excitement from fans</a>. The way the Fortnite Creative ecosystem is currently crammed with clones of tycoon, boxfight, and platforming islands, it's easy to see how adding microtransactions to any of the typical island types could be a bad thing. And it becomes much more difficult to see any possible upside when Epic's example idea is to <a href="https://www.fortnite.com/news/tools-for-in-island-transactions-now-available-to-fortnite-developers?lang=en-US" rel="nofollow ">sell people a better shovel for 300 V-Bucks</a>.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1757/17577455/4602590-fortnitecreativemicrotransactions.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4602590" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1757/17577455/4602590-fortnitecreativemicrotransactions.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4602590"></a><figcaption>Fortnite will allow UEFN developers to sell gameplay items for money soon.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1757/17577455/4602590-fortnitecreativemicrotransactions.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">But the reality is actually pretty murky, because V-Buck transactions are a wildcard that could completely shake up the Fortnite Creative ecosystem and encourage creators to try new things. We've got a digital Wild West here, in a sense. Let's try to understand the situation a little better, and get a better sense of where it may lead us, by taking a deep dive into the details.</p><h2 dir="ltr">What's actually happening with V-Bucks and Fortnite Creative</h2><p dir="ltr">Right now, creators can use UEFN to make islands that use the V-Buck mechanic, but they cannot publish these islands yet. The most important detail to understand here is that UEFN developers will not be able to sell any of the same types of things Epic sells--meaning purely cosmetic items are not allowed. That means no skins, no pickaxes, no kicks, and no original cosmetic types. Likewise, you can't sell XP gains, since Epic sells account levels in the shop. Random loot crates are allowed but will automatically be disabled in the many countries where that predatory practice is banned.</p><p dir="ltr">These restrictions mean, essentially, that anything sold in a Creative island must have a gameplay purpose. So in the current Creative ecosystem, the most obvious options are pay-to-win mechanics, like selling better-quality guns in a boxfight map, or some kind of bonus to your gains in a tycoon. Most of the available options are the kinds of things players generally dislike.</p><p dir="ltr">But since the current Creative ecosystem is currently geared entirely toward earning payouts from Epic through engagement and playtime, these V-Buck transactions probably aren't being added for the sake of most existing islands. Most current islands would drive people away if they started charging for things that used to be free, and those island creators will be able to keep earning those same playtime payouts in the same way they have been anyway. In other words, those maps can keep making money the same way they have been, so they may not want to bother with V-Buck shenanigans that could mess up their current streams of revenue.</p><p dir="ltr">Instead, adding V-Buck transactions to Creative is at least partially about encouraging UEFN developers to try new things. And it's also about capitalizing on Steal the Brainrot, specifically.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Steal the Brainrot and your V-Bucks</h2><p dir="ltr">Steal the Brainrot is the most popular Fortnite Creative island ever, with tens of thousands of players at any given moment and hundreds of thousands at peak times on the weekend. Steal the Brainrot is unique in that it's actually a licensed port of a popular Roblox game. It has no direct competition in Fortnite, because unlicensed copycat islands have faced legal action, and the Roblox version has a number of real-money transactions that are, thus far, absent from the Fortnite version.</p><p dir="ltr">Kids can use Robux to buy money, items, or Lucky Blocks that contain a random Brainrot--with the best Lucky Block going for $30. The mode also sells access to an "admin panel" that offers the ability to mess with your opponents for $50 or more, depending on the day's prices. We should expect these sort of predatory mobile-style, pay-to-win mechanics to be added to the Fortnite version once Epic allows creators to update their islands with the new microtransaction types.</p><p dir="ltr">It's not hard to figure, then, that Steal the Brainrot will be the first major beneficiary of these V-Buck transactions. But that doesn't mean you should expect to see that sort of thing everywhere in Fortnite.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Are Fortnite Creative and UEFN islands about to be filled with microtransactions?</h2><p dir="ltr">While Steal the Brainrot is a prime candidate for V-Buck transactions, that's not the case for most of the rest of the current Fortnite Creative ecosystem, which is largely built on folks ripping each other off. If one of 500 identical boxfight Pit maps tried selling better guns for V-Bucks, people would just switch to one that didn't do that. And it would be the same story with any of the other common Creative archetypes we currently have. You might see V-Buck donation boxes pop up, but you won't see many paywalls added to existing islands.</p><p dir="ltr">As it is now, there's a decent chance that Epic is adding V-Buck transactions to Fortnite Creative specifically to capitalize further on Steal the Brainrot, and there may not be much of an audience for them in the current ecosystem. But the ecosystem will change as a result of Epic offering this new way to monetize maps. You can expect a lot of creators to try the same old exploitative mobile game-style monetization tricks that we're all too familiar with by now, but there actually is some (hypothetical) good news in all this.</p><h2 dir="ltr">The possible upside to Fortnite Creative V-Buck transactions</h2><p dir="ltr">There certainly could be some decent outcomes from this. Right now, creators can only monetize based on their engagement stats, and that's led to a lot of trend-chasing as creators keep trying to make "better" versions of things that simply exist to waste your time rather than be particularly enjoyable. While plenty of predatory monetization could come with this, the upside is that it should encourage creators to try new types of games.</p><p dir="ltr">For example, this scheme would allow a developer to create an experience within a "paid area" and charge V-Bucks for permanent access--selling a video game within Fortnite, essentially. When devs have more ways to monetize, they're more likely to make more unique things.</p><p dir="ltr">But for now, all this is speculative. Aside from those Brainrots, we don't really know what kind of stuff will sell in this ecosystem. This is one of those situations where nobody, including Epic, really knows how it'll shake out, because it's going to be up to UEFN developers, and their players, to decide what works.</p>

                <p>A few weeks before it was slated to hit early access, the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/games-like-the-sims/2900-5835/" data-ref-id="2900-5835">Sims-like</a> life sim <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/paralives/" data-ref-id="5000-504164">Paralives</a> has been delayed to May 2026 so that the developer can address some "impactful bugs" and add more activities to the game.</p><p>Developed by Alex Massé over the course of six years, Paralives is a life sim about building homes, lives, and bonds. You get to create a character, design a house, customize the furniture, and more as you interact with citizens and live out a cozy life in an open-world town. Not unlike The Sims, there's plenty to do: garden, fish, work, swim, raise children, discover personality traits, and more. Unfortunately, while it was planned to launch in early access on December 8, Massé <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1118520/view/627816662678110824" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">posted on the game's official Steam Store page</a> that Paralives' release has been delayed to May 25, 2026.</p>

<p>"We had to make the difficult decision to delay the release," Massé said. "We are truly sorry for the last-minute announcement. After thoughtful consideration, we feel it’s best for the game and the community. This year, we ran many playtests with friends and fans, and we were confident that we could improve the game enough in time for December. In the lead-up to Early Access release, we broadened our playtests with a more varied playerbase, and the latest feedback we received made us realise the game isn’t up to the standard we wanted it to meet for release. Players enjoy the flexibility and the customization of the Paramaker and Build Mode."</p><p>"However, there are still impactful bugs in the Live Mode and a lack of activities to do in the town," Massé continued. "Which dampened the enjoyment of the players, and we feel it is necessary to work on these before delivering the product to the community."</p><p>Massé <a href="https://paralives.notion.site/f138c4f6cb234604be16fe4198d17f51?v=41e2b3e389404b37b4060bc74dead4af" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">pointed to an updated roadmap</a> on the game's official website that focuses on the improvements the team will make over the coming months. Alongside addressing bugs and adding activities, these adjustments will include "fixing important issues and improving the first-time user experience" to ensure that players are happy with the state the game launches in.</p><p>"We are so proud of what we have built, but now, we just need a bit more time to polish the simulation part of the game," Massé continued. "This would ensure Paralives offers a great first experience when it launches, making players come back for every exciting free update and expansion that we will put out afterwards."</p><p>When Paralives launches in early access in May 2026, it'll get new features and add-on content that will be completely free of charge.</p>

                <p>If you're exploring <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/arc-raiders/" data-ref-id="5000-546105">Arc Raiders</a>' first post-launch map, Stella Montis, you may also be working on a quest called Cold Case. This quest asks you to head into Stella Montis to search for a J Kozma storage container to loot. This may sound like a tough thing to round up, but in reality, there's an extremely convenient way to get this quest knocked out and return to Speranza with minimal effort. Let's look into it.</p><p>Keep in mind that you need to extract with an item you'll receive by looting a J Kozma storage container, so bring in a loadout with a safe pocket just in case someone comes along and tries to ruin your run. As you'll see below, we'll be looting a container directly beside an extraction point, which reduces the chances that you'll encounter any trouble. But it's always better to be safe than sorry.</p><p>When you're ready to finish Cold Case, check below for where to find a J Kozma storage container.</p><h2>Where to find a J Kozma storage container for the Cold Case quest</h2><p>The J Kozma storage container can only be found on the Stella Montis map. While J Kozma storage containers can be found in various locations around the map, the easiest and most efficient to grab will likely be the one inside the Lobby Metro Station. This is because it's directly beside the button you'll need to hit to call in the train for extraction. You really can't get any more convenient.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4602586-19a835855e944-screenshoturl.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4602586" data-ratio="0.56325910931174" data-width="1976" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4602586-19a835855e944-screenshoturl.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4602586"></a><figcaption>Head to the Lobby Metro Station to find the J Kozma storage container.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4602586-19a835855e944-screenshoturl.jpg"></figure><p>Head down inside this POI to the extraction point. If you want to get out easily to finish the quest, go ahead and press the button to call the train, then turn 180 degrees to spot a container in front of the button. Walk forward and interact with the container to cause the Old World Books item to fall out. <strong>Make sure you pick up the Old World Books and add them to your inventory</strong>--preferably in a safe pocket just in case.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4602587-19a835855e942-screenshoturl.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4602587" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4602587-19a835855e942-screenshoturl.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4602587"></a><figcaption>Interact with the J Kozma storage container, then loot the Old World Books.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4602587-19a835855e942-screenshoturl.jpg"></figure><p>With the Old World Books obtained for Shani, you'll need to extract back to Speranza to complete the quest. Get in some cover until the train arrives and play it safe, as you never know when another raider could be in the area looking to score some easy loot from folks extracting. Once the train arrives, make a dash for the console inside and get back to Speranza. Easy peasy!</p><p>For more, check out our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/all-arc-raiders-quests-full-mission-list/1100-6535922/" data-ref-id="1100-6535922">full Arc Raiders quest list</a>.</p>

<p>One thing that's quietly slipped by, however, is the reveal of a brand-new suit for our protagonist Samus Aran. As highlighted by <a href="https://x.com/NinWire/status/1989347451074171162">Nintendo Wire</a> in the below post, the suit can be seen in a short clip posted on the <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/jp/games/switch2/bgw5a/troopers/index.html">official Japanese website</a>.</p>

<p>What do you think? We wonder what kind of properties these new suits will take on. Will they grant new abilities? Only time will tell.</p>
<p>Previews have now gone live for Prime 4, including our own. It seems many folks aren't too keen on the new Galactic Federation Troopers accompanying Samus on her journey, but otherwise, this definitely looks and feels like a new Prime game. Heck yeah.</p>

            <p>Most of the attention on Rockstar post-<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/grand-theft-auto-vi">GTA 6</a>'s <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hi-everyone-gta-6-has-been-hit-with-delay-number-two">second delay</a> has, rightly, been focused on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/stop-this-from-happening-again-uk-politician-calls-out-rockstar-over-gta-6-developer-firings">their abrupt firing of 31 employees</a>, for which the IWGB have accused the company of union busting.</p>
<p>As all of that happens, though, the video game making machine continues to churn on, and GTA Online's continuing to get the additions Take-Two said it would when they set this latest delay in stone. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/grand-theft-auto-v">GTA 5</a>'s online element/cash cow guise has long been a playground where regular people like you or me can live out a still somewhat satire-tinged take on the fantasy lifestyles of uber-rich criminals, so it honestly feels a bit strange that it's taken this long for Rockstar to add in mansions.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>As outlined in the latest <a href="https://www.rockstargames.com/newswire/article/3921419k23a552/lay-a-proper-foundation-in-new-listings">Rockstar Newswire post</a>, those big houses are coming in an update this December. At this point, I'd ask that you briefly return your eyes to this article's strapline. There are almost certainly a few suitable living or at least sleeping places a GTA Online character can own at this point that I've left out of that list.</p>
<p>The game's economy, its prices for new additions hyperinflated to compensate for years of heist and business grinding from more dedicated players and the truckloads of real money spent by others, has long been an almost accidentally perfect parody of the real world.</p><p>Now, after years of living in cookie-cutter batchelor pads or tacky penthouses, its biggest whales are set to make the next step you would in real life. Buying a massive house to fill with monuments to your own glory, so you can live in the sort of cartoony decadence historically reserved for monarchs, major religious figures, robber barons, and investment bankers. No one in GTA Online needs a mansion. I'm fairly sure many who buy them will soon abandon setting foot in them, in favour of sleeping under the desk at a business or just not pretending to sleep at all. I remain unsure if this is just human nature or mastefully purposeful satire GTA Online players will play into.</p>
<p>If you jump into GTA Online this month, you can do three new missions for the folks who'll be selling the mansions. These new missions, dubbed "New Listings", involve clearing out squatters, finding construction materials, and motivating contractors. Doing all three will net you a discount of $2 million on your mansion. To put that in context, the <a href="https://www.gtabase.com/grand-theft-auto-v/properties/gta-online/the-orion-yacht">least swanky yacht</a> the game has to offer will cost you $6 million. Some <a href="https://www.gtabase.com/grand-theft-auto-v/properties/gta-online/darnell-bros-warehouse">business warehouses</a> go for more than $3 million. There's no indication of how much the mansions will cost yet, but I'm quite keen to find out, because I think I'll end up rolling on the floor laughing.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/since-rolling-out-this-black-friday-deal-on-blink-video-doorbell-52-off-amazon-sold-10k-units.1354036/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Buying a video doorbell might not sound like the most exciting gift, but it’s one of those practical purchases that ends up being useful for home security. Amazon already <strong>dropped Black Friday prices on its own products</strong> ahead of the official sales rush which explains why Blink cameras and doorbells are sitting at record lows right now.</p>
<p>The latest <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4647/">Blink video doorbell just hit $28 instead of its usual $59 price tag</a>, which makes it an incredibly affordable way to monitor your front door. This doorbell delivers <strong>head-to-toe HD video, infrared night vision, and up to two years of battery life</strong> on three AA batteries.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4647/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>The Blink video doorbell operates off of<strong> three included AA Energizer lithium batteries for up to two years</strong>&nbsp;which means you aren’t climbing ladders every few months to swap out dead cells. Extended battery life comes in the form of efficient power management that will only activate recording after motion gets detected or someone pushes the doorbell button. You can <strong>install this unit completely wire-free</strong> with the included mounting kit in just minutes; no electrical knowledge is required. And if you prefer a wired setup, you can hook it into your existing doorbell wiring.</p>



<h2>HD Video and Night Vision</h2>
<p>It <strong>captures a full head-to-toe view of anyone at your door</strong>&nbsp;which makes a much bigger difference than one would think. Cheaper doorbells usually cut off at chest level and don’t show packages on the ground or clearly show faces. The expanded field of view lets you see where delivery drivers place boxes, identify visitors before opening the door, or monitor your entire doorstep area within one frame. <strong>HD video quality remains clear during the day, and infrared night vision automatically kicks in when the light starts to fall</strong>. You can actually make out faces and read package labels at night instead of just some blurry shapes moving around.</p>
<p>Two-way audio lets you communicate with whoever’s at your door through the Blink app on your phone: You hear them clearly, and they hear you respond in real time. That proves incredibly handy when you’re not home but need to give delivery instructions, tell a friend where the spare key is or let a visitor know you’ll be there in a few minutes.</p>



<p><strong>Amazon includes a free 30-day trial of the Blink Subscription Plan</strong>, which stores your video clips securely in the cloud and adds person detection. That way, you avoid most of the false alerts from cars, animals, or trees that may be moving in the wind, only to receive notifications if an actual human were to approach your door.</p>
<p>The <strong>doorbell supports Alexa-enabled devices</strong> so you can see who’s at your door from any of your Echo Show or Fire TV devices. You can ask Alexa to show your front door camera, arm or disarm your system, or get notifications on your smart speakers about activity at your door. This should come as no surprise as Amazon owns both Blink and Alexa, after all-and the two systems interact seamlessly with no need for elaborate setup routines.</p>
<p>At $28, this doorbell costs less than dinner for two while providing real security value for your home. The deal is live on Amazon right now, and considering how quickly these early Black Friday prices tend to sell out, grabbing one sooner rather than later probably makes sense.</p>
