            <p>
As Fallout 4's massive Fallout: London mod nears its release, distributor GOG has moved to clear up some compatibility questions. The company has confirmed Fallout: London will work with versions of Fallout 4 bought on GOG and Steam, but not those purchased on the Epic Games Store, as the latter doesn't currently support a key feature needed to get it running.
</p>
<p>
If you're not up to date on its progress, Fallout: London - which, as its name suggests, enables players to quest around a post-apocalyptic open-world version of the UK's capital - has hit a few snags on the road to its release. Specifically, developer Team Folon has run into issues getting it to work with Fallout 4's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-4-free-next-gen-update-finally-arrives-this-month">recently released next-gen update</a>.
</p>
<p>
Team Folon made the decision to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-4s-next-gen-update-delays-the-release-of-dlc-sized-fan-mod-fallout-london">delay Fallout: London</a> back in April, anticipating the mod might run into "complications" when Bethesda's next-gen update arrived - and the decision proved wise. Last week, after some testing, the developer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/youll-need-to-downgrade-fallout-4s-next-gen-version-to-play-that-massive-fallout-london-mod">confirmed</a> Fallout 4's next-gen update simply "isn't stable enough" to run Fallout: London right now, and that the mod would be shipping with a downgrader to revert Fallout 4 to an older version.

<figcaption>A look at Fallout 4's Fallout: London mod.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8PuzpblWpVM" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>
We already knew Fallout: London's downgrader would work with the GOG version of Fallout 4, given GOG is distributing the mod (its massive size meant it was too large to host on Nexus Mods), but questions remained about versions of the game purchased on other PC stores - which GOG has now addressed.
</p>
<p>
In a <a href="https://www.vg247.com/fallout-london-gog-confirms-no-epic-store-at-launch">statement provided to VG247</a>, a spokesperson reiterated Fallout: London will work with the GOG version of Fallout 4 and also confirmed it'll be compatible with the Steam release - via a manual downgrade or using a downgrading tool that's current "in progress". However, Epic-distributed copies of Fallout 4 won't work with Fallout: London, given the Epic Store doesn't support the crucial ability to rollback to earlier versions of games.
</p>
<p>
There is, however, some hope Epic owners will be able to get involved eventually. Team Folon has already confirmed it's planning to update Fallout: London to work with Fallout 4's next-gen patch just as soon as Bethesda has got it in a more stable shape.
</p>
<p>
As for when Steam and GOG players can play Fallout: London, that's still TBC. Team Folon recently said "the end is in sight", but that the mod would first need to pass GOG's quality-assurance checks. "Once they've completed the process of double-checking that Fallout: London and its installer work on all supported machines," it wrote, "we should be good to go."

Well the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/steam-spring-sale-igf-2024-narrative-bundle-venba-1851345783&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/steam-spring-sale-igf-2024-narrative-bundle-venba-1851345783" data-vtas-click="self:InlineUrl:inline-url-postbody">Independent Games Festival</a></span>’s Celebration Days is here to change your mind.<br></p><p>The GDC-based indie awards show is hosting its own impressive sale on Steam until July 20th, and it’s giving you a chance to get some of the best indie games around. That includes classics like <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dear-esther-the-kotaku-review-5884520&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dear-esther-the-kotaku-review-5884520"><em>Dear Esther</em></a></span>, and even this year’s stunning <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/1000xresist-indie-narrative-time-travel-impressions-1851466481&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/1000xresist-indie-narrative-time-travel-impressions-1851466481" data-vtas-click="self:InlineUrl:inline-url-postbody"><em>1000xRESIST</em></a></span>. And don’t worry, if your wallet is still hurting from the summer sale; you can still peruse the myriad demos on offer during IGF Celebration Days. </p><p>To help you make sense of all the games you can get on discount, here are nine titles we think you shouldn’t miss.</p></div></div><div><p>This narrative cooking game has a runtime of under two hours, but it packs an emotional punch. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/1491670/Venba/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1491670/Venba/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Venba</em></a></span> focuses on the story of an immigrant family from India trying to make a life for themselves in Toronto. That includes a father who works a boring office job he hates, a young boy born in Toronto who is ashamed of his culture, and a mother who can’t quite figure out how to fit in and holds on to her past through cooking.</p><p>The mother is the titular <em>Venba</em>, and you spend the game playing a series of cooking minigames that produce delicious-looking traditional Tamil cuisine. It all made my mouth water. Through these interactive sections and dialogue-heavy cutscenes, <em>Venba</em> paints a deeply emotional story about the struggle of an immigrant family, and how food acts as a representation of culture that we can hold on to and pass on to the next generation. Be warned, you’ll probably want to buy some Indian take-out after playing this.</p></div><div><p>I’ll be honest, this is just an excuse to tell you to buy my favorite game of this year so far. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/1491670/Venba/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1491670/Venba/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>1000xRESIST</em></a></span> is only slightly discounted, but still worth a buy. </p><p><em>1000xRESIST </em>is a sci-fi narrative adventure with shades of <em>NieR </em>and <em>13 Sentinels: Aegis Rim</em>. More than anything, it’s a story about the Asian diaspora and generational trauma. As a member of the last society on earth, you have the power to dig through your god’s memories—experiences that reveal a complex young girl forced into the role of messiah and god. <em>1000xRESIST</em> feels so confident and stylish in its aesthetic and narrative presentation, creating something unique that you should experience for yourself. I promise it is worth it.</p></div><div><p>One part deck builder and one part visual novel, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/1340480/The_Cosmic_Wheel_Sisterhood/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1340480/The_Cosmic_Wheel_Sisterhood/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>The Cosmic Wheel Sisterhood</em></a></span><em> </em>was one of 2023’s standout indie titles. Its fascinating world is populated with unique characters, like protagonist Fortuna, a fortune-telling witch serving out a thousand-year sentence for predicting the collapse of her own coven. Fortuna summons a demon to help her out of her situation and gains the ability to create her own tarot deck. </p><p>Building cards takes the form of an MS paint-like interface that makes each player’s deck uniquely their own. As former friends and foes visit Fortuna, she reads each person their fortune—something you have some sway over, which adds weight to every decision.</p></div><div><p>If you enjoy a walking sim, then you probably want to give <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/520720/Dear_Esther_Landmark_Edition/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/520720/Dear_Esther_Landmark_Edition/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Dear Esther</em></a></span> a look, considering it’s in many ways responsible for the modern genre. Released in 2012, the game drops you onto a gorgeous but seemingly abandoned island with little in the way of a goal. As you walk around, you uncover bits of information about a small cast of characters you’ll never actually meet. </p><p>The game is a somber and meditative experience, one that ties together its threads into a fuzzy story about the unhappinesses we experience in life. What works so well about <em>Dear Esther</em> is how its narrative becomes less clear the deeper you go, forcing you to make your own conclusions about what is going on. And while the game’s overall vibes might make you worry it could tip over into horror, this really is just a walk… even if you see something mysterious in the distance.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="k3aacllnqzcttcds7p4r" data-recommend-id="image://k3aacllnqzcttcds7p4r" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The player grabs a turquoise-haired woman's boobs and text reads &quot;THE SWIMMER: Pay more attention to them, please.&quot;" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The player grabs a turquoise-haired woman's boobs and text reads &quot;THE SWIMMER: Pay more attention to them, please.&quot;" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Love Conquers All Games</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="k3aacllnqzcttcds7p4r" data-recommend-id="image://k3aacllnqzcttcds7p4r" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The player grabs a turquoise-haired woman's boobs and text reads &quot;THE SWIMMER: Pay more attention to them, please.&quot;" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>The best part about the erotic visual novel <em>Ladykiller in a Bind</em> is how unabashedly queer and unconventional it is. The protagonist of <em>Ladykiller in a Bind</em> is a woman crossdressing as her twin brother, who then proceeds to seduce the men and women around her into some steamy BDSM scenes.<br></p><p>What makes <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/560000/Ladykiller_in_a_Bind/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/560000/Ladykiller_in_a_Bind/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Ladykiller in a Bind</em></a></span>’s premise work so well is its writing. The game delivers its sexyness, its humor, and its seriousness with a deft hand, resulting in fascinating characters that make the seductions so much more involving. While the game bills itself as an erotic comedy, it’s also a caring and celebratory showcase of unconventional sex and gender, with a high respect for consent. </p></div></div><div><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/1677770/The_Case_of_the_Golden_Idol/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1677770/The_Case_of_the_Golden_Idol/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>The Case of the Golden Idol</em></a></span> is a game all about solving a series of progressively complex murders and other crimes. It starts with what appears to be as simple as a single death, but with tendrils that spread out into a grand conspiracy over decades. Each case is presented in the form of a snapshot of a scene, where you can see all the people at the exact moment of a crime and must, through tough detective work, put together what actually happened. </p><p>This is done through a Mad-Libs-esque book that has you plugging in answers that explain the scene. For example, if you are able to discover the name of a suspicious character by reading a contract they signed, then you could plug that name into a sentence accusing them of being the killer. The experience takes a lot of logical reasoning and deductive work and a notebook is a necessity. You might struggle at times, but finally cracking a case is a feeling that never gets old.</p></div><div><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/2103680/Mediterranea_Inferno/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2103680/Mediterranea_Inferno/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Mediterranea Inferno</em></a></span> is a visual novel with a lot going on. It has a psychedelic art style that is mesmerizing to look at, telling a story about the Covid pandemic, queerness, and figuring out identity. Following three friends who are reuniting for the first time since lockdown started, the game takes place during a dreamlike summer vacation that quickly blurs the lines between memory, imagination, and reality. </p><p><em>Mediterranea Inferno</em> is one of the best pieces of media about how an entire generation of youth lost years of their lives to a global pandemic, and the unique trauma that leaves behind. So often the game’s characters just laze about as if nothing will ever happen, and who can blame them? For so long, their lives have been stuck in limbo.</p></div><div><p>As the name suggests, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/1677770/The_Case_of_the_Golden_Idol/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1677770/The_Case_of_the_Golden_Idol/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>A Short Hike</em></a></span>’s objective is to complete a journey to the top of a mountain. Along the way you’ll encounter loveable locals, all with their own little tasks they need help with and stories for you to fall into. Rendered in a low-fi take on Animal Crossing’s cute aesthetic, <em>A Short Hike</em> wraps a touching story about growing up and the realities of life and death into a short, sweet package.</p></div><div><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/1223500/Umurangi_Generation/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1223500/Umurangi_Generation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Umurangi Generation</em></a></span> works as a great companion piece to <em>Mediterranea Inferno</em>, both of which are games about dealing with the Covid pandemic and feelings of being lost. For the cast of <em>Umurangi Generation</em>, the world is quite literally about to end, and every action towards living feels like a last radical form of protest. The game is also about documenting the lead-up to the end of the world, a photography game that tasks you with exploring its pre-apocalyptic world and sneaking into areas to take pictures of every last detail. </p><p>There’s a dissonance to the photography you’re tasked with, as you wonder who you are even documenting things for, but still you’re able to find pockets of joy and love. As well as being a commentary on the mishandling of a global pandemic, <em>Umurangi Generation</em> also seeks to be a piece of decolonialist art. The game takes place in New Zealand, and heavily features Māori culture and language as part of its themes of protest against the remnants of colonial powers that exist today. All of these many pieces of <em>Umurangi Generation</em> are pulled together by stunning art, making the end of the world an eerie delight to get lost in.</p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Last week, The Finals received a significant update with patch 3.4. The update was available immediately for those on PlayStation 5 and PC. However, those playing on Xbox were left in the cold as the new patch for The Finals isn’t available to them.</p>



<p>Days later, developer Embark is apologizing for the issues while not having an answer as to when Xbox players will get update 3.4 of The Finals.</p>



<p>“We’re currently working together with Microsoft on the situation that’s blocking the 3.4 release on Xbox,” Oscar from Embark said in the game’s official Discord. </p>



<p>“I currently don’t have an ETA for when we will be able to release, but as soon as I learn anything I will share it will all of you. We’re super sorry for this lenghty delay, and can only ask that you’re patient with us as we work through it.”</p>



<p>Update 3.4 of The Finals <a href="https://www.reachthefinals.com/patchnotes/340" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">includes a number of balancing changes</a> to the game as well as party chat while in the main menu and shorter wait times to get into games.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/mortal-kombat-1-trailer-reveals-dlc-fighter-takeda-takahashi/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The latest trailer for <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-mortal-kombat-1-patch-adds-60fps-option-on-pc-but-not-for-online-matches/">Mortal Kombat 1</a> has been released, and in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqZwGZBx-t8">this trailer</a>, we get our first glimpse at the DLC fighter, Takeda Takahashi. Luckily, players won't have long to wait until the release of this new character.</p>
<p>Those with the Kombat Pack can try out the new DLC fighter from July 23. However, for those who don't own the Kombat Pack, you will have to wait until July 30 for their full availability. Alongside the release of Takeda Takahashi, a brand new Kameo fighter is also available. Ferra is the latest Kameo fighter to join Mortal Kombat 1 and has plenty of supportive combos that can aid you in battle against your foes.</p>
<p>If you aren't familiar with Takeda Takahashi, he made his first debut in Mortal Kombat X, where you find out that this character was raised as a Yakuza. His cousin Kenshi was also raised in this lifestyle but didn't enjoy it as much as Takeda did. Takeda was chosen to help combat Kenshin and end his torment against his masters.</p>
<p>Takeda Takahashi joins Mortal Kombat 1 as the final character to be released in the Kombat Pack. Additionally, this brand new character alongside Ferra will be available to try out and play during the Evolution Championship Series (EVO), where event attendees can try out these new characters for the first time before they are officially available to all players.</p>
<p>If you have yet to get your hands on the Kombat Pack with the other DLC fighters, such as Ermac, <a href="https://wccftech.com/how-to/mortal-kombat-1-homelander-guide-fatalities-strategy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Homelander</a>, and Quan Chi, you can still purchase it at any time. This will allow you to get early access to Takeda Takahashi should you purchase it before his full release on July 30.</p>
<p>In the trailer, we see Takeda Takahashi utilize some of his most commonly used weapons in the previous iterations of Mortal Kombat. Additionally, he appears in the Mortal Kombat comics, where he uses other weapons that aren't used in the game.</p>
<p><iframe title="Mortal Kombat 1 – Official Takeda Gameplay Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dqZwGZBx-t8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Takeda is seen utilizing a bladed Lasher, leading to brutal attacks against his opponents. He has some great combos out of the gate and can even use an ability where he grapples to the ceiling to then attack his opponent. In addition to the lasher, he has projectiles that he can throw at the opponent, staggering them. When he isn't using his lasher as a weapon, he fights against his opponent with his fists.</p>
<p>Ferra has fantastic frost abilities that help seal the deal in a fight. For example, they are seen putting up a temporary ice wall in the trailer, leaving the opponent cornered and stuck against it.</p>
<p>Are you looking forward to this new Mortal Kombat 1 DLC fighter?</p>

Though he refrains from giving away exactly how the two will differ, Takeuchi does claim that the show is partly an original story, though it does appear as if it’ll mostly adapt the larger points of the established narrative. For those wondering about the authenticity of it all, he states, “The game developers at Sega told me the show is faithful to the games and that my performance was faithful to Kiryu, so that’s enough for me!”</p><p>Speaking of, Takeuchi seems to be taking some liberties with the character of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/fathers-day-video-game-dads-daddies-joel-kratos-bowser-1851541054/slides/6&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/fathers-day-video-game-dads-daddies-joel-kratos-bowser-1851541054/slides/6">Kazuma Kiryu</a></span>. Kiryu has, over the many years, become a beloved and storied character. His life is one of the most vividly realized spans of a character’s being in all of video games. That’s an <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/total-recall-like-a-dragon-infinite-wealth-yakuza-1851289847&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/total-recall-like-a-dragon-infinite-wealth-yakuza-1851289847">imposing legacy</a></span> to live up to, and while Takeuchi definitely wants to honor it as best he can, he also wants to take this opportunity to steer Kiryu—whom he describes as a”strong, well-built, heroic character” that is “starved for love”—with a different vision.</p><p>“I have great respect for the feelings of the fans, but when I play a character, I have to express them in my own way, so I can’t pay attention to the preconceptions of others…There’s no point in trying to surpass the original game; rather I wanted to show respect to the games while making something new as an artist.”</p><p>Despite that, Takeuchi is fully embodying Kiryu, and that includes doing his own fight scenes, as well as developing his fighting style. Takeuchi seemingly found inspiration from the games and began by honing Kiryu’s approach to combat after his time in prison, where he’s sent for ten years in the first <em>Like a Dragon </em>game. From there, he appears to have worked backwards to make something that’ll presumably look and feel sloppier and less disciplined. He claims, “When the story starts in 1995, Kiryu’s fighting style is still rough and not very effective, because he has not formally learned martial arts and he is just using his instincts.”</p><p>From that point on, he will grow as a fighter, which will be evident when the show jumps forward to 2005. The first <em>Like a Dragon </em>game follows Kiryu during two distinct periods of his life, first in the 90s and then after his release from a decade-long stint in prison in 2005, so it’s only natural that he should come across as a different combatant and person depending on the era. To that extent, Takeuchi will also look and sound different depending on the time certain scenes take place. In the 90s, he mentions playing Kiryu with the “kind of energy you only get on the verge of your twenties,” before then “subtract[ing]” those youthful emotions when we touch base with him in 2005.</p><p>The most tantalizing aspect of the show, though, is how it will portray Kamurocho, the fictional district that the games take place in, which takes influence from Kabukicho, an actual red-light district in Japan. Kamurocho is a deeply realized setting, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/yakuza-like-a-dragon-ishin-majima-kiryu-localization-1850263200&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/yakuza-like-a-dragon-ishin-majima-kiryu-localization-1850263200">filled with both oddballs</a></span> as well as recurring figures in Kiryu’s life that have followed him through the decades. Kamurocho also changes extensively throughout the course of the series, which comes as no surprise considering the games span <em>just about </em>50 years.</p><p>According to Takeuchi, the show, which filmed on sets rather than on-location, a lot of attention seems to have been paid to the place and its people. “Kamurocho in 1995 is a lively, warm, sparkling place filled with energy,” whereas 2005’s version of the district is much moodier and “the atmosphere is colder” to reflect the passing of laws criminalizing Kiryu’s way of life, shifts in attitude and culture, and how he feels “out of step with the people around him.”</p><p>Throughout these changes, <em>Like A Dragon: Yakuza</em>’s director Masaharu Take seems to have captured “the flavor of Kamurocho” by being as detailed as Ryu Ga Gotoku Studios, the developers of the games. Takeuchi says that one of those details was the casting of background actors that really brought the setting to life. “The set was so detailed,” he said, “from each passerby to every corner of its streets, that I felt like I had traveled back in time. It didn’t feel like a set at all. Yes, there is some CG enhancement, but I think it was the people who really brought it to life. You can’t fake that.”</p><p>It seems to me that the people involved in this show <em>get</em> what has made the <em>Like a Dragon </em>series so deeply beloved over the years. It’s always had cinematic qualities that’ll likely translate wonderfully to a TV adaptation, but the games’ deep sense of place, and your ability to reach out and feel it all as Kiryu, has also played a tremendous part in the franchise’s ascent. Moreover, Kiryu is a complicated character in an evolving world, and a show feels like an apt way to adapt that story. Everything that Takeuchi has said leads me to believe that this team knows what it’s doing with this property, and I’m now positively buzzing for this series.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The development of the new James Bond game, Project 007, has IO Interactive in a great place from a work and creativity standpoint.</p>



<p>In an interview with <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/stealth/after-years-working-on-hitman-project-007-lead-says-working-on-a-james-bond-game-feels-organic-its-so-close-to-our-dna-that-it-just-feels-seamless/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GamesRadar</a>, IO Interactive chief development officer Veronique Lallier said that working on the new James Bond Game feels “organic” from a development standpoint because of the past work on the Hitman franchise.</p>



<p>“It’s going to be a very cool, very awesome project. I’m super excited about it,” Lallier said. </p>



<p>“And I mean, if you look at what we’ve done in the past with Hitman, 007 just feels organic for us because we’ve done, you know, stories about agents doing things.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>She continued: “It’s so close to our DNA story that it just feels seamless, seamless integration, you know, and everybody, I mean, everybody’s so excited.”</p>



<p>She couldn’t go into more on what to expect from Project 007. However, she made sure to mention that she’s “really looking forward” to talk more about the game in the future.</p>



<p>Project 007 is a working title of the new game from IO Interactive. The game will feature a “wholly original Bond story” that has players “step into the shoes of the world’s favorite Secret Agent to earn their 00 status in the very first James Bond origin story.”</p>



<p>There is currently no release date or platform information for the game. It was first revealed in 2021 with a short teaser.</p>

                <p>The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom might be most notable for allowing you to play as Zelda herself, but series mainstay Link will also be playable, according to the game's <a href="https://www.esrb.org/ratings/39983/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">ESRB listing</a>. Just how prominent of a role he plays, however, remains to be seen.</p><p>The listing reads, "As Link, players use a sword and arrows to defeat enemies; Zelda can use a magic wand to summon creatures (e.g., wind-up knights, pig soldiers, slime) for battle." What exactly the split between Link and Zelda will entail is still unknown. Zelda's ability set will likely be entirely different from Link's. She can also summon household items like tables and chairs and more unusual objects like water blocks.</p>

      </div>
<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1e3459t/comment/ld5c07h/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Some users on Reddit</a> have speculated, based on the trailer, that you will play as Link in an intro section and then take over as Zelda once he is captured. Other users speculated that you will be able to play as Link in a new game plus mode, a la similar modes in Castlevania.</p><p>The opening moments of the trailer--where Link battles and defeats Ganon before getting trapped in a portal--look like edited-together gameplay. Playing as another character in the opening section is a regular video game trick, used in games like Star Fox Adventures and Castlevania: Symphony of the Night. Nevertheless, proving this theory correct or finding out if Link does have a more extensive role will have to wait until the game's full release.</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-preorder-nintendo-switch/1100-6524359/" data-ref-id="1100-6524359">Preorders for Echoes of Wisdom</a> are live. The game releases on September 26, 2024.</p>

My presentation was called “</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://schedule.gdconf.com/session/dial-up-the-diegetics-musical-sound-effects/898557">Dial Up the Diegetics: Musical Sound Effects</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">.” Every year, after I give my lecture at GDC, I include most of the lecture content in an article series (for the benefit of those who couldn’t attend the conference). So with this article, I’m kicking off a six-part series based on my 2024 GDC presentation! In these articles you’ll find all of the discussion from my GDC lecture, supported by many of the videos and illustrations that I used to support the ideas explored in my talk.&nbsp; So let’s get started!</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This discussion is going to focus on sound assets, and we tend to split these into two distinct groups. On one side we’ve got composer assets – acoustic instruments, bands and ensembles, orchestras, vocals, tonal and rhythmic samples, synthetic musical sounds, etc. On the other side, we’ve got sound designer assets – environmental ambience from weather and wildlife, incidental sound effects from tools and technology, and all those sounds we make as human beings.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It’s understood that the music isn’t actually there. It’s non-diegetic – it’s detached – outside the world of the game.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">But having said that, let’s now ask ourselves – what if we could tie our music more closely to the rest of the game’s soundscape? Yes, our music doesn’t actually exist in the game world, but what if our music incorporated sound design that seemed to come from that environment? Would that offer players more narrative immersion? More emotional connection? Would the music seem more intrinsically attached to the game?</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Sound design for composers">Sound design for composers</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Let’s now explore what happens when we game composers use the tools of sound design in our music. By integrating sound effects into our tracks, we can give our music a character and flavor that is strongly associated with the diegetics of the game. It helps our music contribute better to overall immersion. Plus, it’s a lot of fun for us as game composers!</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Over the course of these six articles, I’m going to be drawing examples from the music I composed for thirteen of my previous game projects.&nbsp; These include titles from some famous and popular franchises.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">We’ll be considering ways in which different categories of sound design can function best from within the structure of a musical composition:</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">We’ll also be considering how each of these categories can make our music feel more evocative. So let’s start with the first item on our list:</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Environmental diegetics">Environmental diegetics</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This is the ground floor of sound design – the audio of our surroundings in the game – and these audio assets can be sorted into three varieties.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The first two focus on short, discrete sounds such as the spontaneous noises that are generated by an indoor or outdoor location, and the brief sounds that would be triggered by a person or creature while moving through that unique space. The third category covers the general ambience of the area, which typically includes more lengthy audio sources.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Sound designers are naturally thinking about all three of these categories, but we game composers can use them too. So let’s start by looking at all those little noises that come from our surroundings – and here’s a good example that will show how useful they can be.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Sounds of an underwater world">Sounds of an underwater world</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Developed by Sumo Digital, Sackboy: A Big Adventure is a whimsical platformer that lets gamers jump, swing, and fly through the colorful and zany realms of Craftworld. As a member of the music composition team, I was hired to compose the music for Sackboy’s underwater adventures in the Kingdom of Crablantis. My whole job centered on musically evoking the wonder and beauty of subaquatic exploration – which is the reason why I decided to use water sounds in my music. So first I had to consider – what do we hear when we’re underwater? Something like this?</span></p><p><iframe title="Embedded content" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZXBHlvds4_g?si=Lcb-OkYHJ9S63Qsu" height="450px" width="100%" allowfullscreen="" data-testid="iframe-video"></iframe></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Unfortunately, that didn’t seem right – too busy and chaotic to be a good musical tool.

I took a long recording of water dripping, loaded it into Pro Tools and edited all the individual drips into separate WAV files. Then I created a virtual instrument, applied some reverb and delay, and spread the sounds across my keyboard so that I could play them musically, like this:</span></p><p><iframe title="Embedded content" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gL2Ge39_KsI?si=Mcpie38GlvR7bMn3" height="450px" width="100%" allowfullscreen="" data-testid="iframe-video"></iframe></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">That seemed to be working.

<p>CD Projekt Red, a revered development studio in the gaming industry, has captivated fans with its back-to-back RPG blockbusters. Their ability to craft compelling RPGs, whether set in a dystopian future or a medieval past, is unparalleled. </p>



<p>However, since 2020, the studio has been quiet on the game release front, leaving fans eagerly anticipating their next move. The projects currently in development at CD Projekt Red, including the next Cyberpunk game and the Witcher 4, have been the subject of much speculation. The recent discussion about the latter has only heightened the excitement.&nbsp;</p>



<p>During an interview with The Flow podcast, the CD Projekt Red’s associate game director, Pawel Sasko, spoke about their upcoming project. Sasko clarified to the fans that all the games currently being developed are in the “early stages,” so we shouldn’t expect to hear about them anytime soon. The one that is the “most advanced” out of all the CD Projekt Red games would be Witcher 4. This is not a surprise, as most developers in the studio are currently involved in the upcoming Witcher game.&nbsp;</p>

</p></figure>



<p>The next installment in the Witcher series, codenamed Polaris, is set to start active production in 2024. This ambitious project, the first in a brand-new trilogy, promises to introduce many new elements while staying true to the core experience that fans love. </p>



<p>One of the most significant changes is CD Projekt Red<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-witcher-polaris-production/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> confirming that Geralt of Rivia will not be the protagonist of the next game</a>, hinting at a fresh direction for the series is sure to pique fans’ interest.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On the topic of Witcher, a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/witcher-3-character-creator-mod/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">create-your-own</a> Witcher 3 character mod surfaced online recently. Also, the live-action Witcher series has been renewed for <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-witcher-final-season/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a fifth and final season</a>, with Liam Hemsworth replacing Henry Cavill as Geralt of Rivia.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ducky-zero-6108-review-versatile-but-not-innovative.927591/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/ducky-zero-6108-review/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>The Ducky Zero 6108 is a no-frills mechanical keyboard that’ll get the job done whether you’re playing an intense first-person shooter or typing up a review for the Ducky Zero 6108 mechanical keyboard. It’s a relatively unassuming piece of equipment that’s well-built but offers almost nothing in the way of serious innovation.</p>



<p>I’ve been playing around with the keyboard for a few days now – here’s my full Ducky Zero 6108 review.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-i-expected-more">I Expected More</h2>



<p>Recently, I picked up a Ducky x Fallout keyboard with silent Cherry MX switches and was blown away by the quality of the device. From the on-point colourisation and theme of the keyboard to the super-soft touch of the switches under the resilient, textured keys, everything about it won me over. The RGB popped, it had a nice weight to it, and the keys were well-spaced to accommodate my giant hands.</p>



<p>However, when I secured this latest keyboard for a Ducky Zero 6108 review, I was left disappointed. It’s a little narrower than the Fallout keyboard, which means that the keys are cramped together with almost no spacing that you’d expect from a full-sized keyboard. It also has less attractive RGB functions, while the Fallout keyboard lights up brightly enough to make an impression.</p>



<p>The layout is mostly the same, with the Ducky Zero 6108 opting for traditional keys as media control inputs rather than sliders or knobs, which is always a negative for me. The only noticeable difference is the relocation of the lock indicators – they’re now above the arrow keys, whereas on the Fallout keyboard, they were above the numpad. </p>



<figure><figcaption>Dragons, I guess</figcaption></figure>







<p>The Ducky Zero 6108 I ordered came in black with a swappable spacebar featuring an image of a dragon – for some reason. It also has a small text flash imprinted on the top of the keyboard that represents the brand. Aside from that, it’s as plain a keyboard as you could ever hope to receive. It’s not particularly heavy, but it still has that issue I’ve found with Ducky keyboards where the legs collapse too quickly under pressure.</p>



<h2 id="h-facts-and-figures">Facts and Figures</h2>



<p>At the heart of this Ducky Zero 6108 review sits the cold, hard facts.</p>



<p>My keyboard came with Cherry MX2A Red switches, and they’re nice – but I do prefer the Silent switches. Even with the Q-bounce pad designed to dampen sound, it’s still not quiet enough for me. Thanks to the hot-swap technology in the board, you’re free to do what you want with the switches, replacing them with 3-pin or 5-pin switches without expending too much effort. </p>



<p>Regardless of the switches you opt for, you’ll be getting the same keycaps – double-shot PBT caps that are synonymous with the Ducky brand. The shining gem in the feature line-up of the Ducky Zero 6108 is the fact that it now has tri-mode connectivity. If you want to use it as a wired keyboard, then go right ahead – but you can also make use of Bluetooth connectivity or a 2.4 GHz, dongle-backed connection.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>Those relying on a wireless connection shouldn’t worry too much about the battery failing, as it’s a 2500 mAh unit, which is substantial for many hours of gaming – or work. </p>



<p>In the United Kingdom, the Ducky Zero 6108 retails for around £100, which seems a bit steep, in my opinion. To be honest, there are better options out there for that price point, but if you like the assurable quality that you’ll find in every Ducky keyboard, perhaps it’s worth your money. </p>

<!-- cache hit 9:single/related:00745f29fe880a42986a9b2b2e9888fc --><!-- empty -->
<p>One month after PC emulator UTM was <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/06/apple-rejects-pc-emulators-on-the-ios-app-store/">rejected from the iOS App Store</a>, the developers have <a href="https://x.com/UTMapp/status/1812238024220238180">announced</a> that a new "UTM SE" version is <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/utm-se-retro-pc-emulator/id1564628856">now available for free on the App Store</a>. But the app's performance is severely hampered by Apple's restrictions on so-called "just-in-time" (JIT) compilation, limiting the app's suitability for effectively emulating many PC games.
</p><p>Built on <a href="https://www.qemu.org/">the generic command-line emulation layer QEMU</a>, the <a href="https://github.com/utmapp/UTM">open-source UTM</a> boasts support for "30+ processors," from x86 and PowerPC to RISC-V and ARM64. The App Store listing promises you can "run classic software and old-school games" through both a VGA graphics mode and text-based terminal.</p>
<p>Don't expect a seamless, RetroArch-style path to playing <em>Space Cadet Pinball</em> on your iPhone, though. The UTM developers <a href="https://mac.getutm.app/gallery/">link to pre-configured settings downloads</a> for versions of Windows going back to XP, alongside guides for getting those OSes up and running on iOS. But users will need to bring their own legitimate Windows installation ISO and go through the cumbersome process of installing the OS as well as <a href="https://www.spice-space.org/">a version of SPICE tools</a> to help coordinate access through iOS (downloading pre-built, UTM-compatible Linux builds seems more straightforward).</p>                                                                        
                                                                                
<h2>Slow by design</h2>
<p>Even after that, don't expect high-level performance from this new emulator. That's because UTM SE must abide by App Store restrictions prohibiting&nbsp;apps that "install executable code." As such, the App Store version <a href="https://x.com/UTMapp/status/1812241740172263663">is a "JIT-less" build</a> that uses a Tiny-Code Threaded Interpreter (TCTI) to interpret each original line of code being run rather than fully recompiling it at runtime for smoother performance.</p>
<figure><p><iframe type="text/html" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/aM_jIDCSMcc?start=0&amp;wmode=transparent" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><figcaption><p>A video shows how the lack of JIT recompilation slows down GameCube emulation on DolphiniOS.</p></figcaption></figure>
<p>The lack of that JIT recompilation means the "SE [in UTM SE] stands for Slow Edition," as moderator CZ <a href="https://discord.com/channels/674683213217792078/674683213653737474/1262230627630055524">pithily put it in the UTM Discord</a>. "This is us telling you gaming on UTM SE is not happening." At least one user who tested running Linux via UTM SE <a href="https://www.omgubuntu.co.uk/2024/07/utm-se-qemu-pc-emulator-apple-app-store">confirmed</a> it is "dog slow" and "a gloopy experience." Those who want full performance out of UTM can still install the regular, non-SE version of the app via sideloading or an alt store.</p>
<p>You may remember that the developers of GameCube/Wii emulator DolphiniOS cited the lack of JIT recompilation as the reason their app <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/04/why-a-gamecube-wii-emulator-may-not-be-possible-on-the-ios-app-store/">can't run at a functional frame rate through the iOS App Store</a>. However, similar restrictions haven't stopped <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/04/a-touchscreen-of-nostalgia-delta-brings-classic-nintendo-consoles-to-ios/">emulators like Delta</a> from running classic gaming consoles up through the Nintendo DS at a playable frame rate, suggesting that UTM SE might be sufficient for older MS-DOS or Windows 95-era titles.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gameinformer.com/2024/07/15/takeda-joins-the-mortal-kombat-1-roster-next-week-first-gameplay-revealed<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Mortal Kombat 1’s final Year 1 DLC fighter arrives next week, and it’s Takeda Takahashi. The young Shirai Ryu warrior makes only his second appearance in a Mortal Kombat game and looks every bit as capable as his older clanmates, Scorpion and Smoke.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Although Takeda was Kenshi’s son in his debut appearance, Mortal Kombat X, the remixed timeline of Mortal Kombt 1 has changed him to Kenshi’s cousin. Like Kenshi, Takeda grew up a Yakuza but was more faithful to the clan than his cousin. As such, the Yakuza tasked Takeda with killing Kenshi, and the two battled, with the latter coming emerging victorious. Takeda was mortally wounded in the battle and rushed to the aid of the Shirai Ryu, where Kenshi protected him from being killed by the Yakuza for failing his mission. This causes Takeda to have a change of heart and join the Shirai Ryu to wage war against Earthrrealm’s criminal underground and, eventually, the evil forces of Outworld.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Takeda still utilizes the Shirai Ryu fighting style, including his signature pair of bladed whips. He also sports shurikens, a barrage of teleporting flame attacks, and an aerial grapple best described as mid-air corkscrew piledriver. Check Takeda out below.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p><iframe allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dqZwGZBx-t8" width="640"></iframe></p>

<p>Takeda will be available on July 23, both as a standalone purchase and as a free download for Kombat Pack owners. The same day also sees previously revealed Kameo fighter Ferra become available to buy. Both Takeda and Ferra will be playable for the first time during Evo 2025 this weekend.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>NetherRealm has unveiled our first peek at upcoming DLC fighter, Takeda Takahashi.</p>
<p>Available from 23rd July as part of the Kombat Pack – and from 30th July for everyone else – Yakuza fighter Takahashi has an "inspired moveset" that includes serrated whips, explosive projectiles, and "mastery of teleportation to attack opponents from behind".</p>

<p>"Similar to his cousin Kenshi, Takeda Takahashi was raised a Yakuza. Unlike him, Takeda enjoyed this lifestyle," the description teases. "That's why he was chosen to end Kenshi’s crusade against his masters. The fight mortally wounded Takeda. Unwilling to let his cousin die, Kenshi rushed him to the nearest help: the Shirai Ryu.</p>
<p>"Even after Takeda was healed, Kenshi wouldn't release him. He feared that the Yakuza might kill him for failing his mission. Takeda resisted, attempting to escape repeatedly. But as the months passed, he began to appreciate the Shirai Ryu’s selfless commitment to Earthrealm, a contrast to his past lifestyle. Takeda swore to rip up Earthrealm's underworld by the roots, but he soon learns they are stronger and more tangled than he ever thought possible."</p>
<p>The Mortal Kombat 1 Kombat Pack – which is available as part of the Mortal Kombat 1 Premium Edition or as a separate purchase – includes the Jean-Claude Van Damme character skin for Johnny Cage and six playable DLC characters – Omni-Man, Quan Chi, Peacemaker, Ermac, Homelander, and Takeda Takahashi. You'll also secure five DLC Kameo Fighters – Tremor, Khameleon, Janet Cage, Mavado, and Ferra.</p>
<p>Mortal Kombat 1 is available now on PC, PS5, Switch, and Xbox Series X/S.</p>
<p>New Line Cinema's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mortal-kombat-2-film-ties-down-release-date-but-its-not-out-until-next-year">Mortal Kombat 2 will arrive in cinemas on 24th October, 2025</a>, Deadline reports. It will also play in Imax.</p>

While some superhero narratives follow characters who experience their powers in secret, <em>Supacell </em>shows what happens when the discovery takes place around loved ones, friends, foes, and observing strangers.<br></p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195369" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Netflix's One Piece Live-Action Trailer Has A Treasure Trove Of Anime Easter Eggs" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="118" data-playlist="195369,193144,193799" data-current="195369"><div><p>Netflix's One Piece Live-Action Trailer Has A Treasure Trove Of Anime Easter Eggs</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195369/195369_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195369/195369_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195369/195369_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195369/195369_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/20838.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>This is akin to how the Marvel Cinematic Universe films opened up during and after <em>The Avengers.</em> The stories became more interesting when we started to learn about how superheroes also affect everyday people, a crucial factor in creator Rapman’s <em>Supacell</em>. I appreciate that <em>Supacell</em> went in this direction. It feels more realistic and grounded in the actual world.</p><h2 id="h9008"><a id=""></a><em>Supacell </em>and the internal narrative</h2><p>This focus on the wider world contrasts with the internal feelings, secrets, and activities multiple characters feel, such as when Michael (Tosin Cole) keeps the secret of Dionne (Adelayo Adedayo)’s future death from her, though he shares with her the names he learned when visiting the future.</p><p>The theme of internal instinct versus external impact is also prominent in this episode. As Michael explores his powers, knowing they could save his fiancee, he has to decide whether he believes the truth about what he experienced and what Dionne saw, or his friend’s doubts about whether it was possible—and therefore, whether those in the hood are coming after him.</p><p>Rodney (Calvin Demba) also faces doubt from his friend, who of course doesn’t believe Rodney’s run from London to Scotland and back. As he gains control of his abilities, however, his self-confidence remains undeterred (even though women aren’t exactly interested in his rude catcalling, an action which makes him a bit difficult to like or empathize with).</p><h2 id="h9009"><a id=""></a>Superpower as self-Defense and retribution</h2><p>For Tazer (Josh Tedeku), who has already been injured and traumatized, his superpower of invisibility has become his self-defense. Not only can he move unseen to avoid recognition, he makes a power move that stops his enemies. He characterizes his goals as “money, power, respect.” His friends start calling him “The Ghost.” He gets cocky quickly.<br></p><figure id="" data-id="1f6f0425c91fdeda4b89f3d8b81277cd" data-recommend-id="image://1f6f0425c91fdeda4b89f3d8b81277cd" data-format="jpg" data-width="3839" data-height="2160" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Photo<!-- -->: <!-- -->Netflix</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="1f6f0425c91fdeda4b89f3d8b81277cd" data-recommend-id="image://1f6f0425c91fdeda4b89f3d8b81277cd" data-format="jpg" data-width="3839" data-height="2160" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Sabrina (Nadine Mills) displays a reaction of fear and bewilderment after she uses her own powers. Speaking with her sister, she asks to be comforted while they’re doing hair. Here, Sabrina talks about her oldest sibling role, which could be part of why her ability manifests as a force to physically defend herself and others. As that power increases, she needs to find comfort for balance.<br></p><p>Michael, like Sabrina, experiences some shock and a period of denial, also doing his best to convince Dionne that he doesn’t have powers because he couldn’t use them on demand. Understandably, he does not trust the police and doesn’t want to go to them with this information.</p><h2 id="h9010"><a id=""></a>“These powers are upon me”</h2><p>Michael says this to Dionne when he describes the condition of having superpowers—but she’s convinced they have something to do with whatever happens when he’s around Tazer. He’s also describing the weight of the responsibility he feels for preventing her murder. These layered statements appear more and more as the episode moves on. It’s masterful writing to make the more cerebral Michael the first primary character introduced, because he brings layers to the mysterious connections the superheroes share.</p><p>Initially, I wasn’t sure why each episode bears one character’s name as its title when the episodes, in some instances, give equal time to each main character. However, it becomes evident at the close of episode 2: Michael’s experience connects him to Tazer first, and Tazer’s the one making big moves that shake and move the narrative.</p><p>Again, the episode somewhat sidelined the stories of its women, which often center around what the male characters are doing. We see women cleaning up physical and emotional messes that men make, but we have yet to see a strong narrative for the women in this story. Hopefully Sabrina’s episode will reveal something more complex and empowering for the sole main female character out of the four.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/riyadh-masters-who-will-win-dota/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/riyadh-masters-who-will-claim-the-1-5-million-grand-prize.927549/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/riyadh-masters-who-will-win-dota/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>By the end of the week, the most valuable tournament at the Esports World Cup – Riyadh Masters 2024 – will have wrapped up. This monumental Dota 2 event boasts a whopping $5 million prize pool, and as recent stages came to a close, a fair portion of that money was issued as consolation prizes to the teams leaving the running. Now, we’re on a precipice, standing mere hours away from the commencement of the Riyadh Masters playoffs.</p>



<p>Twelve teams are lined up and raring to go, but only one squad can walk away with the $1.5 million grand prize and 1,000 Club Points. Will Team Falcons scoop another trophy, or will an organisation like Tundra march to victory?</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-anyone-s-game">Anyone’s Game</h2>



<p>In the opening stages of the Riyadh Masters in Saudi Arabia, drama unfolded. Entity and Tundra almost came to blows at one point, with the former team’s captain, Dzmitry ‘Fishman’ Palishchuk getting in the face of Tundra’s Edgar ‘9Class’ Naltakyan. Following a physical altercation – a minor one – Fishman was fined $8,000 by the ESL. Reportedly, the organiser wanted to ban Fishman altogether, but instead, they made him apologise to 9Class. In a statement, Fishman said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I’m closing the topic. Anyone who thinks I’m a bad person and crossed the line — you’re wrong. I’m not the kind of guy who starts conflicts. I think he acted as rudely as possible and provoked me.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Tundra is a frontrunner for winning the top prize at Riyadh Masters. In 2022, the British organisation shocked audiences worldwide by scooping the win at The International, but the team – which has chopped and changed since then – hasn’t made any major waves since. In the group stage, Tundra pushed through without losing a single match and the squad is looking formidable. Presently, only Team Falcons – the current leader of the Club Championship standings – looks comparable.</p>



<p>There are ten other teams in the running, though. In a statement, BetBoom’s Vitalie ‘Save-‘ Melnic voiced his relief and positivity about landing a crucial spot in the lower bracket of the playoffs:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I’m feeling good, obviously. We could have been eliminated from this tournament, but we made it to the lower bracket, and we’re fine with it.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Here’s the full line-up of teams competing in the final stage of the Riyadh Masters (and their first matches):</p>



<ul>
<li>Team Falcons vs. WBG.XG</li>



<li>Entity vs. Gaimin Gladiators</li>



<li>Team Spirit vs. Team Liquid</li>



<li>Tundra Esports vs. OG</li>



<li>Aurora</li>



<li>BetBoom Team</li>



<li>LGD Gaming</li>



<li>PSG Quest</li>
</ul>



<p>Who knows, perhaps we’ll see OG, two-time winner of The International and one of the most successful organisations in Dota 2, undergo a resurgence and secure a massive win. </p>



<p>By the end of the weekend, the victor will be crowned.</p>

            <p>The Finals' 3.4 update rolled out across PC and PS5 last week, but Xbox fans have yet to experience the shorter wait-times and party chat as the patch hasn't yet been released on Xbox consoles.</p>
<p>Developer Embark has apologised for the "lengthy delay" for the Xbox update, but whilst it's "currently working together with" Microsoft to resolve the issue, it's unable to provide an ETA as to when the hold-up will be resolved.</p>

<p>"We're currently working together with Microsoft on the situation that's blocking the 3.4 release on Xbox.

<p>The Finals seemed to get off to a strong start when it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/surprise-the-finals-has-stealth-dropped-and-is-available-right-now">surprise-launched in December</a> last year - its 5v5 action proving popular enough that its developer, Nexon subsidiary Embark Studios, quickly found itself <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-finals-ups-anti-cheat-measures-following-popular-launch">scrambling to deal with an influx of cheaters</a>. Since then, however, the destruction-focused free-to-play shooter has seen <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/destructive-shooter-the-finals-hasnt-performed-as-well-as-expected-says-publisher">"lower than expected" performance</a> according to publisher Nexon, contributing to a shortfall in its forecast revenue.</p>
<p>"Embark Studios' multiplayer shooter dazzles in the moment, but its AI voices are symptomatic of a broader issue with artistic vision," wrote contributor Rick Lane in his <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-finals-review-mechanically-thrilling-thematically-wanting">three star review</a>.</p>

					<p>With rising development costs and general economic issues that have had a widespread impact on the video game industry, major publishers and developers are not as willing to experiment and launch new IPs as much as they were ten or twenty years ago. Sustained by the massive success of the latest entries in cornerstone franchises like <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/resident-evil-4/">Resident Evil</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/monster-hunter-rise-sunbreak-the-flame-of-kamura-burns-ever-hotter/">Monster Hunter</a>, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/street-fighter-6-review-best-fight-our-lives/">Street Fighter</a>, CAPCOM seems to be the only major publisher that still takes risks. Following the release of the relatively solid Exoprimal (albeit <a href="https://wccftech.com/exoprimal-support-is-already-over-one-year-after-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shortlived</a>) last year, the Japanese publisher is launching another experimental title called Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess, a combination of tower defense and action games that provides an engaging experience, even with some shortcomings.</p>

<p>Despite its beautiful traditional Japanese setting being ripe for great storytelling, Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess sadly doesn't feature much of a story. The insatiable greed of man, at some point in the story of this world, awakened the Seethe, underlings of the defiled Mountain Goddess, sweeping the land and stealing the masks of the villages' ancestral deities, spreading defilement in their wake and taking possession of the shrine at the summit of Mr. Kafuku. The only ones who can banish the Seethe and restore order are the Maiden Yoshiro and her protector Soh, who must travel down the mountain to reclaim the stolen masks and perform the Ceremony of Purification, which will open the path to the temple at the summit and grant them the chance of banishing the Seethe for good.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, this is all there is to the Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess story. The Maiden Yoshiro and her protector Soh are silent characters and don't go through any development in their journey. The rescued villagers are mostly generic NPCs with limited lines of dialogue during gameplay and are only roughly defined by a text description hidden in an in-game menu. To be fair, however, there's no denying that Yoshiro and Soh are immediately recognizable thanks to their visual design and especially their animations, making the many cutscenes quite pleasing to watch. As such, those who expected a deep, compelling narrative to make this journey more meaningful would do well to temper their expectations.</p>

<p>Thankfully, Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess delivers much better when it comes to gameplay, thanks to its unique blend of genres. During the game's 20-hour or so campaign, players control Yoshiro's protector, Soh, who has to create a path called Spirit Path that the maiden can traverse to reach the main, tainted Torii Gate of each stage to purify it. Reaching this gate, however, is no easy feat. For starters, Soh and Yoshiro start each regular stage with no help, forcing the protector to explore to free villagers from their bonds and purify the defilement that has gripped the location. By doing so, Soh can not only enlist the help of the freed villagers but also obtain the powerful Crystals used to assign different roles to them and carve the Spirit Path.</p>
<p>These roles are extremely varied and range from the balanced Woodcutter role to more specialized ones, such as Ascetic, who can slow down the Seethe for a few seconds; the defensive Sumo Wrestler, who is essentially a tank that can aggro enemies; the Spearman, an offense-focused role with high attack power; the Thief, who can discover treasure around the map; and the Shaman, a supportive role that can heal other villagers in combat. Villagers act independently from the player and will attack Seethe and activate their unique abilities depending on their action range, which can be expanded by spending another currency, Musubi. Additional abilities for all roles can also be learned via upgrades.</p>
<p>The action component of the Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess experience is represented by Soh themselves. While villagers behave according to their assigned role, the protector is controlled directly by the player. More capable than any of the villagers, Soh can get rid of Seethe with ease thanks to a few handy combos, greater mobility, and some defensive options, like guarding and dodging. The action mechanics are rather straightforward and easy to understand, making it easy to get into the game, even for newcomers to all genres represented in the game.</p>
<p>Topping these mechanics is the gameplay flow of Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess, which is dictated in a rather clever way by the passage of time. During the morning, players can explore freely and move around their villagers to prepare for the coming night when the Seethe appears, a feature that seems to have been inspired by Kentaro Miura's Berserk. The passage of time must also be taken into consideration to complete a stage, as Yoshiro takes time to traverse the Spirit Path, and leaving her out in the open at the start of the night could make defending her more difficult. If the Maiden dies, it is game over.</p>

<p>I have to admit that, for the first few hours, Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess felt nothing more than a relatively solid game that seemed afraid to go all-in in both its action and tower defense components. While the game, right from the get-go, features a decent amount of different enemies against which some roles are more effective than others and introduces some varied scenarios (such as stages with multiple possible Spirit Paths, no action component, various contraptions that the carpenter must repair, multiple, moving Torii Gates from which the Seethe spawn and intense boss battles that play unlike the regular stages, forcing players to quickly switch from offense to defense as required by the situation), the experience felt a little too straightforward, due to the limited number of available roles and, most of all, Soh's limited combat capabilities.</p>
<p>After defeating the Batsu boss around 5 hours in, however, the experience opens up greatly. At this point, not only will you have plenty of different roles to assign to your villagers, but you will also unlock upgrades for Soh, allowing you to spend Musubi to unlock additional abilities such as additional sword guards slots for special abilities and talisman slots that grant passive skills to customize Soh with, a second fighting style based on draw attacks, Perfect Guard, Ukemi for quick recovery after getting knocked down, additional attacks, Archery Skills and even some command abilities to smooth out villagers management, such as the ability to make them assemble at Soh's current location.</p>
<p>This is accompanied by a map design that becomes even better than before, as maps start featuring more contraptions, paths placed on different levels, secrets, and so on that really bring out the best of the game's mechanics, requiring more adjustments on the fly that make the player really feel like the general of a very small army that has to adapt to the shifting conditions of the battlefield. The game really comes together at this point, making the first few hours feel more like an extended tutorial. The difficulty level, however, stays a little bit too low, in my opinion, even in the latter parts of the game, as a simple strategy such as placing villagers close to the Torii gates is usually more than enough to clear even the most difficult, multi-part long stages, which ends up damaging the experience a little. Thankfully, the various side objectives available for all stages provide an incentive to vary up the strategy a bit to fulfill them for rewards.</p>
<p>Exploring defiled locations and fighting Seethe isn't the only thing you will do in Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess, as the game features some simple base rebuilding mechanics. After releasing a village from defilement, it will be possible to assign villagers to rebuild it. These mechanics are rather straightforward, as rebuilding only occasionally requires resources that can be picked up in the village itself, but they provide some nice rewards, including Musubi for upgrades and a selection of collectibles that provide additional information on the game's world. They also provide some welcome respite from all the action, thanks to the soothing piano tracks that play while roaming about purified villages.</p>

<p>Powered by the same RE Engine that has been powering almost every CAPCOM game since the release of Resident Evil VII: Biohazard, Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess looks gorgeous. Despite the zoomed-back gameplay camera, all characters and locations look incredibly detailed. Characters, in particular, are made even better by the dance-like animations that give them a rather peculiar feel. The highly detailed character models also shine during the cutscenes that play every now and then during Yoshiro and Soh's journey.</p>
<p>Being a RE Engine-powered game, Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess also runs quite well on PC. The port is undoubtedly very well done, featuring the full suite of features that are expected nowadays, such as NVIDIA DLSS, including Frame Generation and AMD FSR 3 support, ray tracing support, and a good selection of graphics options to tweak. There are also still previews of how the different settings impact visual quality and a VRAM usage indicator. With every setting maxed out, the game ran at an average of 77 FPS, 1% 55 FPS at 4K resolution, DLSS Quality setting, no Frame Generation, and max ray tracing during a benchmark session held in the Moegi Ridge stage on the machine used for the test (i7-13700F CPU, RTX 4080 GPU, 32 GB RAM). With Frame Generation enabled and ray tracing turned off, which is probably for the best given how it doesn't really improve visual quality all that much, the game ran at a much higher framerate, average 154 FPS, 1% Low 74, with little added input delay thanks to NVIDIA Reflex.</p>
<p>With almost every major publisher focusing on their more popular IPs, a game like Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess is a breath of fresh air. Despite a slow start, a low challenge level, and an almost non-existent narrative, this action game-meets-tower defense experience is engaging and can be enjoyed by all sorts of players, even those who aren't typically into the genre. Hopefully, the game will turn into a series in the future, and a sequel will address the few shortcomings that hold Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess back a little.</p>

<p>While Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess may not be the best action game or the best tower defense game around, Yoshiro and Soh's journey is undeniably compelling. Thanks to great map, scenario, and enemy design, along with plenty of viable tactical options and a wide arsenal of abilities, this new IP from CAPCOM stands out as one of the most surprising titles of the year, held back only by minor issues, such as a shallow narrative and a low challenge level.</p>
