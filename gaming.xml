<p>Hmmm, we've heard this one before</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure><a title="Super Mario RPG Kissing" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/4fe6194595fe8/super-mario-rpg-kissing.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>It's official, folks — Mario and Peach are <em>not</em> in a relationship. Nintendo said it, so it <em>must</em> be true.</p>
<p>A few days ago, on the Nintendo Today! App, the Big N dropped this major bombshell on the world, revealing that the Princess of the Mushroom Kingdom and the Italian plumber are simply "good friends". We missed the initial post, but thankfully, <a href="https://x.com/KirPinkFury/status/1948141191440286122">KirPinkFury</a> has us covered.</p>
<p>So, wait, is this despite the fact Peach has kissed Mario multiple times and baked multiple cakes for him? We know both of these acts <em>are</em> platonic (cheek kissing, baking), but... okay.</p>

<p>This all sounds a little familiar, right? Another darling Nintendo couple, Zelda and Link, are frequently under the microscope from fans. Are they in a relationship? Aren't they?</p>
<p>Zelda's voice actor, Patricia Summerset, once said "I know that [Link and Zelda] are in a relationship with each other" in an interview with <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/patricia-summersett-interview-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom/">TheGamer</a> as part of a wider conversation about enjoying the ambiguity of their relationship, before putting out a <a href="https://x.com/Summersett_/status/1660696953712197635">statement a few days later saying</a> that her words do "not imply" that the duo are in love.</p>
<p>Really, though, all of this is up to fan interpretation. If Mario and Peach want some privacy, that's great. Nintendo can insist the pair aren't a couple — and maybe that's the case. To be fair, Peach <em>did</em> turn down Mario in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_odyssey">Super Mario Odyssey</a>.</p>
<p>Next thing Nintendo will be telling us is that Donkey Kong doesn't love bananas.</p>
<p><em>Let us know in the comments whether you believe Nintendo is telling the truth.</em><em><br></em></p></section>

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/elden-ring-nightreign-conquering-the-night/">Elden Ring Nightreign</a> will add its highly-requested two-player mode next week on July 30, 2025, with Patch 1.02, and while the introduction of duo expeditions remains the highlight for the update, FromSoftware is also adding a few key quality-of-life and UI improvements in the patch, like better filtering options for relics.</p>



<p>FromSoftware's co-operative multiplayer roguelike action game has gone better than anyone might've expected when the game was first announced at <a href="https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-nightreign-announced-by-fromsoftware-for-pc-and-consoles/">The Game Awards 2024</a>. In its launch month, it was <a href="https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-nightreign-topped-us-sales-charts-may-2025/">topping sales charts in the US</a> and breaking into the <a href="https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-nightreign-was-one-of-may-2025s-top-5-games-by-revenue-according-to-newzoo-while-oblivion-remastered-remains-firm-in-the-top-20-for-revenue-and-mau/">top five on more global charts</a>.  It stayed in the <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-fastest-selling-gaming-hardware-us-history/">top-10 for US game sales for June</a>, and remained <a href="https://wccftech.com/dune-awakening-rematch-newzoo-june-2025/">one of the top-15 best-selling games globally</a>. </p>



<p>The introduction of a duos mode, which is <a href="https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-nightreign-may-get-proper-duo-support-post-launch/">something players have requested</a> since FromSoftware tested the game's servers in an open beta (and <a href="https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-nightreign-mods-framerate-two-player-mode-easier-solo/">already implemented themselves through mods</a>) is sure to give the community a boost, and might even convince some players who have been on the fence to finally pick it up, knowing that they can hop in with the one other friend they have, and no longer be handicapped by being unable to find a third friend to play with. </p>

</p></figure>



<p>It'll be interesting to see where Nightreign stands when we get a look at sales and engagement charts for July halfway through next month. Even though this update is coming right at the end of the month, it has approximately two days to make a significant impact.</p>



<p>FromSoftware also recently celebrated Elden Ring Nightreign <a href="https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-celebrates-10-million-shadow-of-the-erdtree-5-million-nightreign/">surpassing 5 million units sold since it launched in May</a>, a huge milestone for the company's first major foray into multiplayer and the first time it has adapted one of its major narrative and action-driven Souls games into an online multiplayer experience. </p>



<p>It'll be interesting to see how FromSoftware's second foray into turning elements players recognize from its single-player games into a multiplayer experience goes when <a href="https://wccftech.com/fromsoftwares-the-duskbloods-announced-exclusively-for-nintendo-switch-2/">The Duskbloods</a> arrives as a Nintendo Switch 2 exclusive. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Bandai Namco and FromSoftware have announced when you can expect the&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring Nightreign&nbsp;</em>duos update to land, and it's not too far away at all, so get ready to revisit Limveld with your buddy.</p>

<p><i>Elden Ring Nightreign</i>'s duos mode was first <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-nightreign-duos-confirmed-sales" rel="nofollow">revealed in early June</a>, but now, the two studios have <a href="https://x.com/ELDENRING/status/1948745061984014727" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">unveiled</a> the date on which you'll be able to tackle Limveld's dangers with just one other person: July 30th.</p>

<p>The ability to play in a duo will be added as part of patch 1.02, which will also bring new ways to sort relics, hopefully making organizing your favorite loadouts a little easier.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/elden-ring-nightreign-duos-update-tower.jpg?itok=LdljaS4A 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/elden-ring-nightreign-duos-update-tower.jpg?itok=NrplKzA7 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Elden Ring Nightreign</em>'s duos mode is coming very soon.</figcaption></figure><p>As a reminder,&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring Nightreign&nbsp;</em>was released back in late May, quickly <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-nightreign-sales-2m" rel="nofollow">amassing over two million sales</a> on its first day of release. At launch, the game only supported solo play or squads of three, and players quickly began requesting a duo mode, which FromSoftware was evidently happy to implement.</p>

<p>After release,&nbsp;<em>Nightreign&nbsp;</em>received a number of updates, adding features like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-nightreign-adel-upgraded-update" rel="nofollow">new superpowered versions</a> of the Nightlord bosses to take on, plus new quality-of-life improvements and more.</p>

<p>News of the duos update's release date comes shortly after&nbsp;<em>Nightreign&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-shadow-of-erdtree-nightreign-sales" rel="nofollow">reached five million sales</a>&nbsp;earlier this week, with&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring</em>'s&nbsp;<em>Shadow of the Erdtree&nbsp;</em>DLC currently sitting at ten million. Those are some pretty encouraging numbers for Bandai Namco, I'm sure.</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring Nightreign</em>, it's a multiplayer-focused spinoff of&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring&nbsp;</em>that sees players descending on a randomly-generated map in order to kill minibosses, loot gear, and get strong enough to take on a boss at the end of each run.</p>




<p>The game is one of two major multiplayer-oriented titles in FromSoftware's slate for the next couple of years; the other is&nbsp;<em>The Duskbloods</em>, a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/the-duskbloods-fromsoftware-nintendo-switch-2" rel="nofollow">Switch 2-exclusive PvPvE game</a> set to launch sometime next year.</p>

This year, the lineup became even more powerful and spec-packed while still retaining the low-profile and portable 14-inch design that initially drew us to it.

It’s not particularly tough to find a gaming laptop with these specs. However, I think it’s a feat to cram them all into a laptop that’s small and light enough to easily bring on trips, and to deliver it at a price that’s not too high considering what you’re getting.</p><div><form><div><h2>Verge Deals</h2><p><span>Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we’ve tested sent to your inbox weekly.</span></p></div></form></div><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTU2Ng=="><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Cameron Faulkner</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/tech/713731/asus-rog-g14-zephyrus-gaming-laptop-5070ti-deal-sale]]></content:encoded>

                <p>A two-player mode is making its debut in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/elden-ring-nightreign/" data-ref-id="5000-654963">Elden Ring Nightreign</a> next week, allowing duos to run together without seeking a third player.</p><p>From Software has announced that a duos mode will be added to Elden Ring Nightreign on July 30 alongside update 1.02, which is aimed at providing a variety of other quality-of-life improvements. Full patch notes haven't been revealed yet.</p><p>The highly requested feature will be a game-changer for some folks looking to tackle the challenges in Limveld. When Elden Ring Nightreign first launched, players were forced to enter matches solo or in a group of three, the latter of which forced duo partners to team up with a random third player or seek out an additional person to join up.</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-already-has-a-two-player-co-op-mod-on-pc/1100-6531963/" data-ref-id="1100-6531963">A mod</a> released just weeks after Elden Ring: Nightreign launched allowed PC players to run duos, but players on other platforms remained out of luck. So, it's great news that everyone will finally be able to run matches with a team size of their choosing.</p><p>Elden Ring Nightreign director, Junya Ishizaki, initially told <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-fromsoftware-game-director-explains-why-the-spin-off-exists-reveals-whether-george-r-r-martin-was-involved-and-why-fans-shouldnt-call-it-a-live-service" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN</a> the game's focus on three-player matches "was largely a game-balancing decision, rather than a game-design decision." Later, he admitted in a <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-director-says-duos-were-kind-of-overlooked-and-neglected-as-main-focus-was-on-3-players" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">separate interview</a> that a two-player mode was "simply something that was overlooked during development" before stating the team was looking into it.</p><p>This new addition couldn't come at a better time, either, as Elden Ring Nightreign recently crossed <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-has-now-crossed-a-major-milestone/1100-6533406/" data-ref-id="1100-6533406">5 million units shipped</a>. This comes along with news that the original Elden Ring has sold over 30 million copies alone, making the franchise From Software's most commercially successful ever.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> MindsEye GameSpot Review</p>
      </div>
<p>The post begins as follows:</p><p>"Dear community, it’s been just over a month since MindsEye launched, and we’re grateful for your support and detailed feedback. Your input is shaping our ongoing efforts to enhance the game.</p><p>In June, we committed to delivering a great experience for all players. Since then, we’ve released three updates, each addressing bug fixes and performance improvements across all devices, driven by your reports and suggestions. We hope you’re starting to see the impact of these changes, and we’re committed to building on this progress. Moving forward, updates may be less frequent, but with the aim for each to bring more meaningful changes."</p><p>The rest of the post vaguely outlines the next few months of fixes. First though, Build A Rocket Boy issued a delay to its Hitman crossover, which was originally intended to land in July. The team didn't provide a firm date, or even commit to a window--just saying that it has been pushed back and that it looks forward to "delivering this exciting crossover when the time is right."</p><p>Looking forward, August will bring MindsEye's fourth significant performance update to both PC and consoles. This patch will also bring features requested by the community, including skippable cutscenes and instant access to user-generated content on PC.</p><p>In September, MindsEye is set to receive another major update across all systems, once again bolstering performance and providing vaguely worded "gameplay improvements, alongside a number of enhancements to core gameplay mechanics."</p><p>Beyond that, MindsEye and Build A Rocket Boy's future remains uncertain. The studio was almost immediately rocked by news of layoffs following the game's turbulent June launch, when it was plagued by technical bugs and visual glitches that inspired a lot of frustration and mockery online. GameSpot's own <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/mindseye-review/1900-6418374/" data-ref-id="1900-6418374">MindsEye review</a> called it a "stringent and relentlessly dull video game," awarding the game a 3/10 while somehow avoiding most of its technical blemishes.</p>

			<p>New details on CD Projekt Red's mysterious Project Hadar emerged online today thanks to a new job ad discovered online.</p>



<p>As spotted by<a href="https://tech4gamers.com/cdpr-project-hadar-action-rpg-melee-combat/"> Tech4Gamers</a>, CD Projekt Red is looking to hire a Senior Gameplay Designer specifically for the development of Project Hadar, a new IP from the studio, with at least 5 years of experience in the RPG/action titles with melee-oriented combat, suggesting the game will have a major focus on close range combat. The rest of the required qualifications don't reveal anything new about this game, such as experience in working with Unreal Engine 4 and Unreal Engine 5, as the studio announced a while back that Epic's engine would power its future projects.</p>



<p>Project Hadar is only one of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-sequel-3-witcher-projects-new-ip-in-development-cd-projekt-red/">many projects</a> in development at CD Projekt Red, which include a sequel to Cyberpunk 2077, currently known as Project Orion, and the next entry in The Witcher series, The Witcher 4. Revealed last year during The Game Awards show, the next entry in the series, which will star Ciri in place of Geralt of Rivia, is being made with a console-first approach and will take<a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-4-dev-wants-to-take-full-advantage-of-the-generational-shift-since-the-witcher-3-tech-demos-village-npc-density-was-based-on-novigrad/"> full advantage of the generational shift </a>since The Witcher 3. How this will be achieved remains to be seen, but if the tech demo shown <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-iv-new-trailer-ps5-60-fps-ray-tracing/">last month</a> is of any indication, it definitely looks like CD Projekt Red will have no trouble surpassing anything it has released so far.</p>

                <p>Earlier this week, VShojo, the VTuber talent agency that claims to put "talent first," came under fire as its biggest talent, Ironmouse, alleged that the company had failed to pay her a "significant sum" of money, as well as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/twitchs-biggest-vtuber-quits-agency-alleging-missing-charity-funds-of-over-500000/1100-6533329/" data-ref-id="1100-6533329">failing to donate</a> more than $515,000 that she had raised for the Immune Deficiency Foundation. Now, after a mass exodus of its talent that saw VShojo without a single remaining VTuber on its books, the CEO has admitted to spending those funds to try to keep the company afloat.</p><p>In a statement posted to the <a href="https://x.com/VShojo/status/1948442574722924778" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">VShojo X account </a>on July 24, CEO Justin Ignacio has admitted that he has "mismanaged the company into the situation you're all witnessing." Ignacio goes on to confirm that VShojo has been facing financial difficulties in recent months, and that despite raising "around $11 million" to pursue a "talent-first" approach, the company eventually ran out of money. Ignacio says that "some of the money was raised in connection with talent activity," and claims that he later learned that it was intended for a charitable initiative. He continues, "We were working hard to raise additional investment capital to cover our costs, and I firmly believed, based on the information available to us, that we would be able to do so and cover all our expenses. We were unsuccessful in our fundraising efforts."</p><p>However, <a href="https://t.co/TJZBz8jga5" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">users on X</a> have pointed out <a href="https://t.co/sxmoBNqh8G" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">several instances</a> where Ignacio acknowledged Ironmouse's charity streams at the time, and allege that he did not "later learn" this fact at all, but was aware for the duration of VShojo's struggles. As a response to the situation, <a href="https://x.com/RimaEvenstar/status/1948526128391721036" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Twitch has removed the "GunRun" global emote</a> that was dedicated to Ignacio.</p><p>As Ignacio confirmed that "VShojo is shutting down," some former talents are taking this as a sign that the nondisclosure agreements that they signed are no longer valid. Several VTubers have spoken out and alleged that the company had "<a href="https://x.com/Veibae/status/1948509619543822703" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">predatory contracts</a>," and claiming that they are owed merch and sponsorship funds from "<a href="https://t.co/NyQZbKvso1" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">years ago</a>."</p><p>In line with discovering that the funds she raised had not been donated to the Immune Deficiency Foundation, Ironmouse launched her own <a href="https://tiltify.com/@ironmouse/ironmouse" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Tiltify campaign</a> to raise money for the charity. At the time of writing, it has surpassed $1.25 million raised in just three days.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mindseye">MindsEye</a> developer Build A Rocket Boy has delayed its previously announced Hitman mission, as it continues to issue fixes to the game.</p>
<p>In a new post, Build A Rocket Boy apologised that its Hitman crossover mission with publisher <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/io-interactive">IO Interactive</a> would no longer be releasing in July as once planned. Rather, the studio has moved this release back to an unspecified date down the line. "We look forward to delivering this exciting crossover when the time is right and will provide further updates as soon as we're able," it wrote.</p>
<p>What Build A Rocket Boy does have planned for the coming months, though, is two more updates promising yet more performance improvements. In August, the studio will also introduce skippable cutscenes.</p>

<p>"It's been just over a month since MindsEye launched, and we're grateful for your support and detailed feedback," <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MindsEyeGame/comments/1m8ykoy/july_update_from_the_studio/">the team wrote on reddit</a>. "Your input is shaping our ongoing efforts to enhance the game."</p>
<p>Since this post has gone live, many on the game's Discord are now lamenting the lack of a clear roadmap for MindsEye and content in general.</p>
<p>"Confirmation that Hitman is delayed is good and all, but there's no substantial content or really anything to bring people back until after September," a user wrote. "What's the point of the premium pass or getting a deluxe edition if we don't get the promised content," one user added (to which another replied with simply: "Cash grabbing punks.")</p>
<p>Another commenter on the MindsEye Discord wrote: "Of course, we do want the game to get fixed. But what we also need is content, or else there is literally no point continuing to try and fix stuff." Someone even <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/splitgate-2-fails-to-make-fps-great-again-goes-back-into-beta-resulting-in-layoffs-and-server-shutdowns">suggested Build A Rocket Boy take a leaf out of Splitgate 2's book</a>, and rerelease MindsEye in an 'early access' state.</p>
<p>"As a console player, there is literally no reason to return to this game," yet another user on the MindsEye Discord wrote.</p>
<p>These sentiments are echoed on the MindsEye reddit. "I want more MindsEye  missions to be added. Community and developer made ones as promised. As well as the essential fixes needed for free roam. Different playable characters, driveable vehicles, time of day, etc," reads one reply to Build A Rocket Boy's latest update.</p>
<p>Others are just annoyed that in its update post, the studio hasn't really said anything of any real importance. "This update doesn't say anything meaningful at all, are you kidding?" reads a reply.</p>

<p>MindsEye released earlier this year, however it wasn't the smoothest of launches. Many found themselves presented with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mindseye-launches-with-myriad-of-glitches-and-issues-as-developer-promises-performance-update">distorting character bugs and stuttering issues when they booted up the game</a>.</p>
<p>Prior to its release, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mindseye-boss-claims-games-negative-reaction-ahead-of-release-has-been-paid-for-in-concerted-effort-against-studio">CEO of Build a Rocket Boy suggested negative reviews had been paid for</a>, though MindsEye's publisher <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mindseye-publisher-doesnt-believe-negative-comments-were-paid-for-despite-developer-suggesting-otherwise">did not share this belief</a>.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mindseye-review">Eurogamer's review of MindsEye</a>, writer Rick Lane said: "Although it shows some early promise, MindsEye is sunk by a ridiculous story, inconsistent writing, poorly designed mission scenarios, and utterly atrocious combat." We awarded it one star.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/mindseyes-hitman-crossover-mission-delayed-leaving-its-community-starving-for-content]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/early-digital-sales-data-from-newzoo-shows-toby-fox%E2%80%99s-deltarune-topping-nintendo-switch-2-sales-charts-in-select-markets.1253313/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Global data firm <a href="https://newzoo.com/">Newzoo</a> has published a <a href="https://newzoo.com/resources/blog/nintendo-switch-2-launch-what-early-digital-data-reveals-for-third-party-games">new report</a> looking at the data from early digital sales on the Nintendo Switch 2, as Newzoo's product manager, Max Otten, tried to get an early answer to the question of whether the Switch 2 is a viable ecosystem for third-party developers and publishers.</p>



<p>Otten looked at digital sales data for June 2025 from six major markets, including the United States, the United Kingdom, Italy, Spain, Germany, and France, and saw that three out of the top five games by units sold on the Nintendo Switch 2 were third-party titles. At the top of them all? Toby Fox's long-awaited Undertale follow-up, Deltarune.</p>



<p>Deltarune doing well isn't the biggest surprise, considering that <a href="https://wccftech.com/dune-awakening-rematch-newzoo-june-2025/">a week ago</a>, Newzoo reported that it had made it into the top-20 games by revenue for June 2025. However, that knowledge doesn't exactly wear off the shock of seeing it over top of Mario Kart World, though this is where it's important to remember that the sales data Newzoo is pulling from does <strong>not</strong> include physical sales. In the US alone, <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-fastest-selling-gaming-hardware-us-history/">82% of people who bought a Switch 2 also bought Mario Kart World in a physical forma</a>t, so it makes sense that the digital sales aren't as chart-topping as you might expect.</p>



<figure><figcaption>Image credit: Newzoo</figcaption></figure>



<p>Though perhaps the most surprising aspect of Newzoo's report is seeing Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour in second place behind Deltarune, and ahead of Mario Kart World in third. Otten's guess at what happened here, while accurately calling Welcome Tour "<em>essentially a tech demo</em>" in the same breath, is that the combination of its "<em>low price and lack of launch-window exclusives likely helped drive</em> <em>sales</em>."</p>



<p>Rounding out the rest of the top five is Minecraft in the number four spot, and No Man's Sky in the number five spot, and once again, at least one of those games is not the third-party title you'd expect. Minecraft isn't a surprise, but No Man's Sky is, at least slightly, when considering that <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3lun37qmdfn2k">Cyberpunk 2077</a> on Switch 2 has been one of the standout third-party releases so far, at least in the US.</p>



<p>That top five changes slightly when Otten looks at which games that were exclusive to the Nintendo Switch 2 had the biggest revenue share, with Mario Kart World in its expected top spot, followed by Fantasy Life I in second, Cyberpunk 2077 in third, No Man's Sky in fourth and Nintendo Switch 2 Welcome Tour in fifth, making it once again a three-to-two third-party games majority.</p>



<figure><figcaption>Image credit: Newzoo</figcaption></figure>



<p>In fact, the only top five Otten shows in his report, where the majority of games listed are first-party Nintendo titles, is the list of top five titles by monthly active users for June 2025. Mario Kart World, Mario Kart 8 Deluxe, The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, and Animal Crossing: New Horizons take first, third, fourth, and fifth place on that list, respectively. Fortnite is the only third-party entry in the number two spot.</p>



<figure><figcaption>Image credit: Newzoo</figcaption></figure>



<p>All this said, Otten closes his report by saying that "<em>While first-party titles command overall sales leadership, there are clear pockets of spending on third-party content—especially for games that are well-optimized, offer genre diversity, or present new experiences to the platform."</em></p>



<p>He adds that "<em>early data shows glimmers of promise for third-party titles at launch, and players are showing up for enhanced ports, narrative games, and non-traditional Switch genres.</em>"</p>



<p>We'll learn more about how viable the Nintendo Switch 2 ecosystem is for third-party titles the deeper into the console's life we go. Only looking at first-month sales in select major markets and sticking with digital sales is nowhere close to the whole picture. But Otten has shown how even new third-party titles can find chart-topping success. It'll be interesting to see what else is able to top the charts in the coming months. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Publisher tinyBuild and developer Hypnohead have announced that their roguelite kingdom-builder&nbsp;<em>The King Is Watching&nbsp;</em>has hit a major sales milestone within its first four days on release.</p>

<p><em>The King Is Watching&nbsp;</em>was released <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/the-king-is-watching-release-date" rel="nofollow">on Monday this week</a>, and according to a <a href="https://x.com/TKIWGame/status/1948672902137811139" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on the game's official X (formerly Twitter) account, it's already hit the 100,000 sales mark. That puts it in good company, alongside the likes of&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pioneers-of-pagonia-100k-sales" rel="nofollow">Pioneers of Pagonia</a>&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/timberborn-sales-surpass-100k-copies-in-first-week" rel="nofollow">beaver colony sim&nbsp;<em>Timberborn</em></a>.</p>

<p>On Tuesday, Hypnohead and tinyBuild <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2753900/view/542237641778661281" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">confirmed</a> that free content updates are in the works for&nbsp;<em>The King Is Watching</em>, with features like mid-run saves being "actively work[ed] on", according to the two studios.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-king-is-watching-sales-100k-colony.jpg?itok=9k9uY5oa 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-king-is-watching-sales-100k-colony.jpg?itok=D-9_d71p 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>The King Is Watching&nbsp;</em>has reached an impressive sales figure in just four days.</figcaption></figure><p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>The King Is Watching</em>, it's a roguelite kingdom-builder in which you must construct and maintain your kingdom, but with a unique twist (which the title has probably already given away).</p>

<p>As the king, you must actively watch areas of your kingdom you want to progress; if you don't, they will fall to "laziness" and "chaos", as the Steam page says, but watching them will result in progress "thriv[ing]".</p>

<p>You'll have to balance which parts of your kingdom you most want to succeed. Do you want to emphasize resource production, for instance, or defense to make sure your kingdom won't be caught unawares?</p>

<p>As you play, you'll gain upgrades that will allow you to watch more of your kingdom at once, and you'll also need to make decisions about where you want to invest the resources you've gathered in order to make your kingdom the best it can be.</p>




<p>Since this is a roguelite, you'll also have to deal with unique events that can significantly change the outcome of a run. Each run will allow you to unlock new abilities to help your kingdom thrive in future.</p>

<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>The King Is Watching&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2753900/The_King_is_Watching/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC via Steam</a>, where it's currently on sale for $13.49 or your local equivalent (although that's with a 10% discount).</p>

Players can use bumper buttons to cycle between districts of the same type, or a dynamic radial menu that appears over resource piles and presents actions specific to them. Additionally, following the console release, the PC version of <em>Frostpunk 2</em> will receive an update enabling players to use this new UI scheme whenever a gamepad is connected.</p></blockquote><p>“Initially, we tried to carry over as many interface solutions as possible [from PC to console],” said <em>Frostpunk 2</em> production coordinator Igor Skibinski in a press release. “But the two games differ so much in terms of gameplay that we had to adapt and rework those systems over time. Still, our main focus was to make interaction with the game feel seamless—so players never have to think about how to play while they’re playing. Our ambition is to once again prove that even complex <a title="Genres > Strategy [268 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/strategy">strategy games</a> can feel intuitive and satisfying on consoles.”</p><!-- AD: content -->

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/elden-ring-nightreign">Elden Ring Nightreign</a>'s promised duo mode is finally on the way, and will be added to the game next week.</p>
<p>From 30th July, a two-player mode will be available in patch 1.02, alongside some UI improvements and more Relics filtering options.</p>
<p>The mode was announced in a new trailer, which you can see below.</p>

<p>Despite being primarily a three-player co-operative game, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-walkthrough-8042">Elden Ring</a> spin-off has been criticised by players - in part because the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/should-you-play-elden-ring-nightreign-solo">included solo play was too tough</a>, and in part because a two-player option wasn't included.</p>
<p>Previous patches have re-balanced the solo mode, while a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-nightreign-two-player-mode-confirmed-as-fromsoftware-celebrates-35m-players">two-player mode was promised at the start of June</a>. Now it's finally on the way.</p>
<p>Yesterday, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-nightreign-has-sold-over-5-million-copies-while-shadow-the-the-erdtree-makes-it-past-10-million-at-last">FromSoftware announced Elden Ring Nightreign has sold over 5m copies</a> since its release at the end of May.</p>
<p>Further, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-tips-and-tricks">Elden Ring DLC</a> Shadow of the Erdtree has sold 10m copies, meaning around a third of players have dived into the expansion.</p>
<p>FromSoftware has continued to update Nightreign with the rotating Everdark Sovereigns. The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-nightreigns-next-round-of-everdark-sovereigns-will-arrive-at-the-end-of-the-month-but-still-no-sign-of-duo-mode">next batch of these extra challenging Nightlords will arrive on 31st July</a> - good luck fighting them in pairs!</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-nightreigns-duo-mode-is-finally-on-the-way-with-release-date-confirmed]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>With just a month to go before the game's planned release, the Dying Light: The Beast team has announced a delay.</p>
<p>"It has always been our goal to make Dying Light: The Beast the best Dying Light game we've ever released," <a href="https://pilgrimoutpost.techlandgg.com/news/dying-light-the-beast-release-date-moves">Techland wrote in an update</a>, stating that to "honour" this promise it would be delaying the release until 19th September. This will allow the team to add some extra polish before the zombie shooter gets released into the wild.</p>
<p>"We've been carefully listening to what you've been saying - whether through playtests, the recent preview coverage and in comments," the Dying Light: The Beast developer continued. "With just four additional weeks, we can address final details that make all the difference between good and great."</p>
<p>This extra time will see Techland making some adjustments to cutscene and player animations, as well as finetuning the balance of gameplay elements. It also aims to make the game's UI clearer.</p>
<p>"We know this might be disappointing to some fans, and we understand," Techaland said "Dying Light: The Beast is the culmination of everything we've learned in more than a decade of the series, and this experience has shown us how important the first impression is."</p>
<p>We got our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dying-light-the-beast-is-a-new-18-hour-standalone-game-that-began-life-as-dlc">first look at Dying Light: The Beast during Gamescom last year</a>, when Techland revealed this release initially started out as DLC. "But after two years of work, its size and scope has changed so much that it evolved into a standalone, self-contained experience," the studio wrote at the time. "To show appreciation for the community who patiently waited for the DLC, Techland will be offering Dying Light: The Beast at no extra cost to all owners of the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dying-light-2-stay-human">Dying Light 2 Stay Human</a> Ultimate Edition, delivering a full standalone adventure instead of just a DLC."</p>
<p>Then, last month, the studio announced an August release date (which has obviously now changed). At this time, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dying-light-the-beast-is-coming-out-on-25-august-revealed-at-summer-game-fest">Techland also released a new trailer</a>, featuring new gameplay, along with a variety of chases and parkour - a key feature in Dying Light games.</p>
<p>Earlier this month, meanwhile, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dying-light-studio-techland-cancels-two-in-development-games-clarifies-no-staff-reductions">it was reported Techland had cancelled two in-development games</a>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/dying-light-the-beast-delayed-for-further-polish]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section>
<figure><a title="Patapon 1+2 Replay Review - Screenshot 1 of 4" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/157588/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure><p>Ever since I was a kid stomping his feet to pop songs in <strong>Dance Dance Revolution</strong> and getting pep talks from <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps1/parappa_the_rapper">PaRappa the Rapper</a> about how I gotta believe, I’ve been a fan of rhythm games. And while I love popular juggernauts in the genre like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wii/guitar_hero_5">Guitar Hero</a>, I’ll always prefer something with more originality than just simply holding down a button, such as <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/3ds/theatrhythm_final_fantasy_curtain_call">Final Fantasy Theatrhythm</a>.</p>
<p>Cue <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/patapon_1plus2_replay">Patapon</a>, a quirky blend of rhythm and strategy originality released exclusively on Sony’s PSP and now out on other platforms thanks to Bandai Namco. You play as a god to the charming Smurf-esque creatures and use drums to direct them during missions. Your controller buttons correspond to a rhythmic phrase. Want them to move forward? That’s easy! <em>Pata pata pata pon!</em> Need to attack? No problem; just hit ‘em with a <em>pon pon pata pon</em> combo. Keep the beat going and you’ll enter into a Fever, which increases your attack and defence.</p>
<figure><a title="Patapon 1+2 Replay Review - Screenshot 2 of 4" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/157586/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>It’s a novel concept for a game. You’re completely detached from the Patapon who worship you because you’re viewed as a god. It’s by far more preferable to having an actual in-game avatar because it easily lets you slip into your role as the Patapons’ saviour. You can’t help but grow attached to the Patapons themselves. They’re just lil’ eyeball guys! In a lot of ways, it reminds me of the connection you form with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/pikmin_1">Pikmin</a>. You <em>want</em> to protect your Patapon because they’re yours.</p>
<p>The gameplay is largely simplistic but that’s not necessarily a detriment. In fact, the game works better because of its simplicity, especially when it comes to the general gameplay loop.</p>
<p>You’ll be doing a lot of grinding missions over and over to collect Ka-Ching and other materials that let you create stronger Patapon units, of which there’s a decent variety, from spear throwers to archers.</p>
<p>That grind might sound annoying but the missions in both games are bite-sized little morsels, so you aren’t locking yourself into 10-minute missions or anything worse. I suspect this is because both games were originally on the PSP and it was better for the missions to be quick and snappy rather than long and drawn out. Regardless, it works in each game’s favour.</p>
<figure><a title="Patapon 1+2 Replay Review - Screenshot 3 of 4" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/157594/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>But don’t go into Patapon expecting a Guitar Hero clone. Patapon utilises rhythm, but personally, I’m hesitant to call it a rhythm game. It’s more of a strategy game that uses rhythm than a rhythm game with strategy elements.</p>
<p>That also means you shouldn’t go in expecting a toe-tapping soundtrack. Patapon’s usage of rhythm doesn’t necessarily make for good music to listen to. You may only be playing percussion but Drum Hero this ain’t.</p>
<p>There are issues, however. For starters, you can’t pause the game, which is frankly ridiculous in 2025. You can work around this by pressing the Home button rather than a pause button, but it’s still ridiculous. And I can’t count the number of times I was so close to entering Fever mode only to screw up by being the tiniest bit off beat. Sometimes it seems like you have enough space to attack only to realise you need to keep marching forward.</p>
<figure><a title="Patapon 1+2 Replay Review - Screenshot 4 of 4" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/157592/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>And worse, it’s very easy to throw off your sense of rhythm when it comes to things like boosting your defence. You can chalk it up to being a skill issue but while you can alter the button-press delay in options, you can’t test your changes out without going into a mission and then exiting it, which is incredibly frustrating and time-consuming.</p>
<p>One thing that can’t be complained about is the aesthetic of the games. There’s an almost moving comic book-like quality to these little eyeball monsters. They’re absolutely adorable to look at, and it’s fun watching them follow your commands in battle by throwing spears or cutting up enemies. And the backdrops in the missions are absolutely beautiful, with crisp shades of reds, yellows, blues, and more. Patapon oozes style in spades and its aesthetic is its biggest strength, even over the gameplay’s.</p>
<p>Patapon is fun to play in docked but I’d argue that it feels best in handheld mode, harkening back to its earlier PSP days. There’s just something about plugging in your headphones and chilling on the couch while sending your Patapon army into battle. The performance is largely the same between docked and handheld, so you won’t be missing out either way.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Patapon 1+2 Replay is a real blast from the past and more than proves why this series was such a hit for Sony. It’s simple to play, but if you dig deeper you’ll find that there’s a real meaty game here. The rhythm-based controls make it unlike any strategy game you’ve ever played before. There are some small frustrations, but generally it succeeds in what it tries to do.</p></section>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Eleventh Hour Games, the developer and publisher of hack-and-slash action RPG&nbsp;<em>Last Epoch</em>, has announced that it's been acquired by&nbsp;<em>PUBG&nbsp;</em>publisher Krafton for an undisclosed sum.</p>

<p>In an <a href="https://forum.lastepoch.com/t/a-new-chapter-for-eleventh-hour-games/78482" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">announcement</a> on the official&nbsp;<em>Last Epoch&nbsp;</em>forum, Eleventh Hour founder Judd Cobler, also known as moxjet200, says Krafton was the right choice for his studio because the publisher "shares [Eleventh Hour's] passion for the ARPG genre".</p>

<p>Cobler says the partnership between Eleventh Hour and Krafton will give his studio "the opportunity and resources to execute on [its] goal of creating the very best ARPG in the genre", which is a lofty goal indeed given just how much <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/path-of-exile-2-changes-grinding-gear" rel="nofollow">competition</a> there is in the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/diablo-4-roadmap-2025" rel="nofollow">space</a>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/last-epoch-eleventh-hour-games-krafton-purchase-beam.jpg?itok=fMd3ZiI2 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/last-epoch-eleventh-hour-games-krafton-purchase-beam.jpg?itok=arPPcM7g 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Last Epoch&nbsp;</em>developer Eleventh Hour Games has been purchased by Krafton.</figcaption></figure><p>According to Cobler, he spoke to "dozens of strategics and potential partners" before settling on Krafton, having decided that the partnership will guide Eleventh Hour through "some of the largest upcoming challenges [it will] face as a studio".</p>

<p>This is far from the first acquisition Krafton has made in recent years. Back in August last year, the publisher <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/krafton-acquires-tango-gameworks-and-hi-fi-rush-ip-with-plans-for-future-expansion" rel="nofollow">acquired Tango Gameworks and its&nbsp;<em>Hi-Fi Rush&nbsp;</em>IP</a>&nbsp;following its <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/microsoft-arkane-austin-tango-gameworks-shutdown" rel="nofollow">shutdown at the hands of Microsoft</a> (which, in retrospect, would seemingly prove to be the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/perfect-dark-reboot-canceled-developer-shut-down" rel="nofollow">start of a pattern</a> for the tech giant).</p>

<p>Prior to that, Krafton <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/krafton-acquires-ascent-developer-neon-giant" rel="nofollow">snapped up&nbsp;<em>The Ascent&nbsp;</em>studio Neon Giant</a> in 2022, which itself followed the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pubg-owner-krafton-buys-subnautica-dev-unknown-worlds" rel="nofollow">purchase of&nbsp;<em>Subnautica&nbsp;</em>developer Unknown Worlds</a> the year prior.</p>

<p>The latter would prove to be a somewhat poisoned chalice for Krafton; earlier this month, the publisher fired the former heads and founders of Unknown Worlds, prompting <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/subnautica-charlie-cleveland-lawsuit" rel="nofollow">a lawsuit</a>&nbsp;in which said founders alleged their ousting (and&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/subnautica-2-delayed-2026" rel="nofollow"><em>Subnautica 2</em>'s delay</a>) was part of a plot to avoid paying employees a sizable bonus.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/subnautica-2-krafton-unknown-worlds-last-epoch.jpg?itok=Es2mWZNo 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/subnautica-2-krafton-unknown-worlds-last-epoch.jpg?itok=sd_v0HTC 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Krafton's other acquisitions include&nbsp;<em>Subnautica&nbsp;</em>studio Unknown Worlds.</figcaption></figure><p>If you're wondering exactly how Krafton's acquisition will affect Eleventh Hour, well, Cobler says it won't, really. He <a href="https://forum.lastepoch.com/t/a-new-chapter-for-eleventh-hour-games/78482/4" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">says</a> his studio will remain a subsidiary under Krafton and won't be merged into the publisher; in fact, new staff will be hired soon, apparently.</p>

The content of the listing itself doesn't reveal much else about the content of the game, but the filing does suggest that Metroid Prime 4 is indeed closing in on the finish line and could still stand to release later this year, where it's being pegged as a holiday release at the moment.</p><p>Additionally, VGC reports that the listing comes around the same time that it's been hearing of an imminent Nintendo Direct, where it is believed that a formal release date will finally be provided.</p><p>It's been a long road for Metroid Prime 4. Initially announced at E3 in 2017, the game has changed developers and undergone at least one reboot before being re-announced with the subtitle Beyond back in 2024. Since then, there's been a steady drip of information, including the game's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/metroid-prime-4-beyond-hands-on-facing-18-years-of-expectations/1100-6530584/" data-ref-id="1100-6530584">first hands-on previews</a> earlier this year, as well as a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/metroid-prime-4-beyond-out-now-poster-spotted-in-london/1100-6532578/" data-ref-id="1100-6532578">bizarre advertisement</a> in the London Underground that falsely claimed the game was "out now."</p><p>Now, Metroid Prime 4 seems likely to launch by the end of 2025 on both the Nintendo Switch, which it was first announced for, and its successor, the Switch 2.</p>

<p>However, as rumours of a Nintendo Direct continue to build, a rating for the game in <a href="https://www.grac.or.kr/Statistics/Popup/Pop_ReasonInfo.aspx?914b326d87c6070f0760b092a83d753ca6c813a6a053e8e5ec12581d53453bb0">South Korea</a> (shared on the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1m8u5ge/metroid_prime_4_beyond_has_been_rated_in_korea/">GamingLeaksAndRumours</a> subreddit) has fans hopeful that the game isn't far off.</p>
<p>The rating doesn't really give away anything, but it looks like it was filed on 10th July 2025 but was only published today.</p><div><figure data-videoid="4gZSQE4poJM" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4gZSQE4poJM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/4gZSQE4poJM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4gZSQE4poJM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed402431wnogvt&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4gZSQE4poJM" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>Metroid Prime 4 has been a <em>long</em> time coming, so many fans are scrambling for any sliver of information they can get. As always, a rating doesn't mean anything, so try to keep your expectations in-check.</p>
<p>But, as we mentioned above, the timing also lines up with those Nintendo Direct rumours, with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/prominent-youtuber-doubles-down-on-belief-that-a-nintendo-direct-is-due-this-month">NateTheHate reiterating that one is still coming this month</a>. Since then, <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/with-release-news-expected-soon-metroid-prime-4-has-been-rated/">VGC</a> has also said that reports of a Direct "match up" with what the outlet has also heard.</p>
<p>With next week being the final week of July, will we see a Direct? And, will Metroid Prime 4: Beyond get a release date? Time will tell. That <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/random-switch-2-ad-claims-metroid-prime-4-is-out-now">London Underground poster blunder</a> got us all a bit <em>too</em> excited...</p>

                <p>This week, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marvels-fantastic-four-movie-receives-new-subtitle/1100-6525360/" data-ref-id="1100-6525360">The Fantastic Four: First Steps</a> brings Marvel's first family of superheroes back to the big screen after a decade away. While the FF doesn't currently have a video game of their own, they are prominently featured in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/marvel-rivals-review-i-can-do-this-all-day/1900-6418329/" data-ref-id="1900-6418329">Marvel Rivals</a>. And in the video below, the entire cast takes turns playing their respective characters in the game.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h45Sr1kafGU" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/h45Sr1kafGU" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>YouTube host Loserfruit put this gathering together when the cast was in Australia to promote First Steps. It seems safe to say that none of the FF cast are avid gamers, and Pedro Pascal noted that he never went past the original Nintendo console. But they all took their turns, starting with Ebon Moss-Bachrach playing the Thing, followed by Pascal as Mr. Fantastic, Vanessa Kirby as Invisible Woman, and Joseph Quinn as the Human Torch.</p><p>The cast had very amusing reactions to some of the alternate FF costumes, including the wedding attire for the team. They were also stunned by Invisible Woman's Malice skin, which Kirby jokingly suggested would be in the First Steps sequel. But if the cast thought that was shocking, someone should film their reactions when they see the actual Malice costume from the '80s.</p><p>At one point in the video, Kirby thought her character was naked while she was invisible. But that was just the application of the Invisible Woman's power. The entire cast looked like they were having fun mashing the buttons and embracing their characters' abilities. But they're far from ready for competitive Marvel Rivals matches.</p><p>Marvel Rivals recently <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marvel-rivals-season-3-adds-phoenix-and-blade-introduces-new-villain/1100-6532891/" data-ref-id="1100-6532891">added Phoenix to the game</a>, with Blade to follow soon.

NetEase has also hinted that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marvel-rivals-new-character-arrivals-wont-rely-on-mcu-release-schedules/1100-6533078/" data-ref-id="1100-6533078">more MCU tie-ins</a> may be coming to the game in the future. However, the dev noted that the game's storyline will always come first over any MCU content.</p>
