Compared to our first test build, the current Tokyo Game Show demo features more optimized character models, including better facial details and color schemes. These tweaks allow characters to show more dynamic facial expressions, which helps bring out their personalities and make them feel more alive—closer to their original designs.</p><p>“We’ve also optimized models, textures, and lighting for environments, which greatly improves the overall visual presentation and immersion of the game world. We’ve enhanced character ultimate skills and weapon attack effects as well, making ultimates look more powerful while shortening the cutscenes to avoid interrupting combat flow. Weapon hits also feel more responsive now, and the visuals make attacks look more powerful. These adjustments make the combat feel even cooler.</p><p>“There’s a lot more in the pipeline that we couldn’t show today. But we’ll be revealing updates in the official DNA community.

<p>Over the weekend, hours-long streams of <em>both</em> games are popping up online, most of which have been chopped up into small, social media-friendly pieces and shared to sites like X/Twitter, Reddit, and TikTok, often without spoiler warnings.</p>

<p>It's unclear how the streamers acquired their copies, or if the early streams will remain live and online, but at the time of writing, there are many, <em>many</em> clips of both games making the rounds.</p>
<p>If you are hoping to go into either game without any prior knowledge, now may be a good time to start that social media detox or, at the very least, update your list of muted/banned words…</p>
<p>For anyone who missed the news, it's finally been confirmed that the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/silent-hill-2-remake-will-be-a-ps5-console-exclusive-for-one-year">Silent Hill 2 Remake will be exclusive to PlayStation 5 for one year</a>.</p>

These games have allowed players to import their choices from previous entries in order to keep a consistent world state that feels shaped, to some degree, by your actions. The process by which players do that has changed over the years, with the <em>Mass Effect </em>games reading your old saves and <em>Dragon Age </em>getting a separate app to craft your world state for <em>Inquisition</em>. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-preview-bioware-rook-solas-rpg-1851648350&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-preview-bioware-rook-solas-rpg-1851648350"><em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</em></a></span> will handle this differently, allowing you to make a few key decisions in the character creator that reflect choices made in <em>Inquisition </em>before you get started on your next journey. Still, for all its apparent concern with making players feel like their decisions have lasting impact, BioWare’s track record is arguably a bit spotty in this regard, and at times the studio has outright undone the effects of major choices players have made. At a preview event earlier this month John Epler, creative director on <em>the Veilguard</em>, talked a bit about the studio’s philosophy for handling these decisions. — Kenneth Shepard</p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-canon-choice-bioware-mass-effect-5-1851646112?_gl=1*1gwgbb5*_ga*MTk5MTE1MDYyMi4xNzIyNjAzODYw*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTcyNjkxNjk4Mi45OC4xLjE3MjY5MjQzMDQuNTkuMC4w&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-canon-choice-bioware-mass-effect-5-1851646112?_gl=1*1gwgbb5*_ga*MTk5MTE1MDYyMi4xNzIyNjAzODYw*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTcyNjkxNjk4Mi45OC4xLjE3MjY5MjQzMDQuNTkuMC4w">Read More</a></span></p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="e1f3d793eba72309f2592996c2de6bca" data-recommend-id="image://e1f3d793eba72309f2592996c2de6bca" data-format="jpg" data-width="1501" data-height="845" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Rook talks with Neve." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Rook talks with Neve." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->BioWare / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="e1f3d793eba72309f2592996c2de6bca" data-recommend-id="image://e1f3d793eba72309f2592996c2de6bca" data-format="jpg" data-width="1501" data-height="845" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Rook talks with Neve." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>When you boot up BioWare’s long-awaited RPG <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-bioware-dreadwolf-andromeda-anthem-1851545206&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-bioware-dreadwolf-andromeda-anthem-1851545206"><em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</em></a></span> on October 31 and create your custom character, you’ll be asked what Faction your protagonist Rook came from before the game starts.

<p>According to X/Twitter user j0nathan - a leaker with extraordinarily good prior form for Assassin's Creed information - Invictus will be a <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fall-guys">Fall Guys</a>' inspired multiplayer game in which players will assume the avatars of different Assassin's Creed characters and fight to get through each round.</p>

<p>"Among the game [types], we find Team Deathmatch, another free-for-all, and a speed game where you have to go to light points scattered on the map. If you qualify for the next round, you can choose types of powers to form a build in the final game."</p>
<p>Interestingly, j0nathan belives they can "confirm" two characters - Ezio and Cesare Borgia - and says the gameplay will be "arcade" like in nature, "with hits without real impact and even a 'bubble' shield like in Smash Bros".</p>
<p>Maps will be inspired from Assassin's Creed games, such as Mirage's Baghdad, Shadows' Japan, "a map in a paradise island" likely inspired by Black Flag. There's also a map based on Pompeii, complete "with rising lava".</p>
<p>Without formal confirmation from Ubisoft either way, all we can do is take this as a rumour for now, but even the moderation team on the subreddit admits Jonathan has been "somewhat accurate" with prior Assassin's Creed-flavoured leaks.</p>
<p>"We don't know how much or little is true of it so maybe don't come to conclusions?" the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/assassinscreed/comments/1fmbohk/comment/lo9e5xi/">moderator</a> cautioned. "Sure Jonathan has leaked in the past that has been at least somewhat accurate. But this info could be old or incomplete. Or just not true."</p>

The executive had been speaking at a <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/gran_turismo_7" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gran Turismo</a> event, where the latest in the series at the time, <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps4/gran_turismo_sport" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gran Turismo Sport</a> on the PS4, was being demoed alongside the PlayStation originals. “The PS1 and PS2 games look ancient,” he exclaimed. “Like, why would anyone play this?”</p><p>As frustration among PlayStation fans grew, these off-the-cuff remarks from Ryan took on a life of their own: many assumed Sony, under his leadership, hated its legacy. The executive <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2021/06/actually_playstation_boss_jim_ryan_doesnt_hate_old_games" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">later clarified</a> in an interview with <a href="https://www.axios.com/signup/gaming?utm_source=axios&amp;utm_medium=house-ads&amp;utm_campaign=subs-house-ads-hpside-gaming&amp;utm_content=gaming-launch" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Axios Gaming</a> that he “wasn’t trying to be disrespectful of our heritage”. He explained: “I guess my big learning from all of this is when [Gran Turismo creator] Kazunori Yamauchi unveils his next game side-by-side with its history, I will keep my mouth shut.”</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/09/20/classics-1-1726851878109.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Mister Mosquito is an obscure Japanese game now available via PS Plus Premium. It's also referenced in Astro Bot!</figcaption></figure></output><p>But actions speak louder than words and many fans have been waiting for Sony to actually <em>do</em> something with its back catalogue that proves it cares about the games from its past. I believe, while far from perfect, <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/guides/all-ps-plus-games" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PS Plus Premium</a> is quietly amassing a catalogue of deep cuts from PlayStation’s history that fans absolutely <em>should</em> be paying attention to. And as nostalgia builds ahead of <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2024/09/jaw-dropping-30th-anniversary-ps5-pro-console-and-accessories-will-bankrupt-you" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the brand’s 30th anniversary</a> – with that sumptuous collection of <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/guides/how-to-pre-order-ps5-pro" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">new PS5 hardware available to pre-order soon</a> – it’s something that both long-time fans and newcomers should be paying attention to.</p><p>For example, this week saw the release of <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps2/mister_mosquito" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Mister Mosquito</a> on PS5 and PS4, a largely forgotten 2001 title from Japanese developer Zoom which <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/reviews/ps2/mister-mosquito" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">encapsulates everything great</a> about <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/guides/playstation-studios-all-sony-first-party-developers-and-what-theyre-working-on" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PlayStation first-party</a> in the PS2 era. As its name implies, this game sees you buzzing around the unsuspecting Yamada family’s home, drawing blood without arousing suspicion in some of the zaniest gameplay you’re likely to find on <em>any</em> format today. The original was brought overseas by Eidos under license from Sony, but is reproduced with Trophies and various quality of life features here.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>While there’s clearly more Sony could be doing here, I really appreciate how many games are being given a new lease of life with the inclusion of Trophies.</p></div><p>Many games are also making their European debuts as part of Sony’s hushed retro push. Earlier in the year, Level-5’s legendary PSP tactics game <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/psp/jeanne_darc" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jeanne d’Arc</a> launched into PS Plus Premium, marking <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/reviews/psp/jeanne-darc" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the first time it’s been officially available</a> outside of Japan and North America; Sony famously passed on publishing the game in Europe, despite its story being loosely inspired by Joan of Arc and the Hundred Years’ War in the 15th Century. Similarly, cult PS2 aerial combat game <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps2/sky_gunner" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sky Gunner</a> was ported to the PS5 and PS4 this week, <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2024/09/dont-sleep-on-ps2-secret-gem-sky-gunner-coming-to-ps5-ps4-next-week" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">marking another European debut</a>.</p><p>While there’s clearly more Sony could be doing here, <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2024/05/ps5-ps4s-brand-new-ps2-emulator-features-up-rendering-rewind-quick-saves-more" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">with its official emulator in particular</a> lacking the upscaling capabilities of third-party rivals, I really appreciate how many games are being given a new lease of life with the inclusion of Trophies. The fan favourite PS2 <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps2/timesplitters" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TimeSplitters</a> trilogy was <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2024/09/ps-plus-premiums-timesplitters-titles-now-all-have-trophies-on-ps5-ps4" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">updated this week to incorporate Platinums</a>, and for many this is all the incentive needed to revisit old favourites. Iconic PS1 games like <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps1/g-police" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">G-Police</a>, <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps1/jumping_flash" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jumping Flash!</a>, and <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps1/intelligent_qube" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Intelligent Qube</a> all come with a list of achievements to unlock as well.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/09/20/classics-2-1726852027065.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Jeanne d'Arc has finally made its European debut, 18 years after it was first released.</figcaption></figure></output><p>Even lesser known instalments from classic PlayStation properties are getting a second shot in the spotlight; <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2024/09/play-the-worst-ratchet-and-clank-on-ps5-ps4-with-ps-plus-premium" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">I wouldn’t exactly recommend</a> spin-offs like <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/psp/secret_agent_clank" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Secret Agent Clank</a> and <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/psp/jak_and_daxter_the_lost_frontier" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jak &amp; Daxter: The Lost Frontier</a> over their mainline counterparts, but I like that they exist in an easily accessible form on modern hardware. The real goal for Sony will be to ensure the original trilogies accompany them; you can play all of the <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps2/jak_and_daxter_the_precursor_legacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jak &amp; Daxter</a> games with Trophies on the PS5 and PS4, but we’re still awaiting the original <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps2/ratchet_and_clank" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ratchet &amp; Clank</a> releases.</p><p>While I suppose I could criticise Sony for dragging its heels, I’d rather it do that than nothing at all. The catalogue of PlayStation classics on PS Plus Premium is growing, with many available a la carte on the <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/tags/ps-store" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PS Store</a> if you don’t want to pay out for the pricey subscription. The emulation could admittedly be better, and the software could be coming quicker – but quietly the Japanese giant is embracing its heritage and making it available for veterans and newcomers alike.</p><p>If you’re thinking, “Like, why would anyone play this?”, it’s because, as we approach PlayStation’s all-important 30th anniversary, there’s a lot of love for its back catalogue. And gradually, month by month, Sony is actually beginning to acknowledge that.</p><p><em>Sammy Barker is the Editor of </em><a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Push Square</a><em>.

			<p>While Sony has <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-specs-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced </a>its PlayStation 5 Pro mid-generation console refresh, Microsoft is betting on a wholly different strategy for Xbox. According to rumors, there will be no mid-generation console refresh akin to Xbox One X, which launched one year after the PS4 Pro and delivered top console performance.</p>
<p>Microsoft is instead entirely focused on the next generation of hardware. Sarah Bond, President of Xbox, has famously <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-next-generation-largest-technical-leap-ever-seen/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">teased</a> that it will deliver the biggest technological leap ever seen between console generations:</p>
<p><em>[...] we're also invested in the next-generation roadmap. And what we're really focused on there is delivering the largest technical leap you will have ever seen in a hardware generation, which makes it better for players and for creators and the visions that they're building.</em></p>
<p>It is believed that Microsoft will heavily integrate machine learning techniques to achieve this bold objective, which would otherwise be nearly impossible with silicon improvements alone.</p>
<p>Putting aside that for a moment, though, Xbox fans are also wondering whether they will see a repeat of this generation's dual SKU lineup with the Series S and X. Well, <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/were-building-plans-for-the-25th-anniversary-of-halo-and-xbox-microsoft-confirms-in-a-new-interview-we-have-such-a-rich-heritage-you-have-to-celebrate-that" target="_blank" rel="noopener">according to Windows Central</a> (which is generally well-informed when it comes to Microsoft), the tech giant is planning to release a traditional console to succeed the Xbox Series X and then a separate handheld that would be Microsoft's 'take' on the Steam Deck.</p>
<p>Indeed, the rumors of an Xbox handheld have intensified lately, with Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer also <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-handheld-teased-by-phil-spencer-who-also-confirms-more-first-party-games-coming-to-other-consoles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">teasing</a> that work is indeed being done on such a project. The big question on the handheld is whether it would be a Windows-based PC handheld or an actual Xbox handheld that plays console games, though the former option appears more likely at this point. Spencer mentioned Microsoft had work to do to improve the Windows handheld experience and this project could be the right time to deliver.</p>
<p>Currently, Microsoft is <a href="https://wccftech.com/next-xbox-console-might-launch-in-2026-according-to-new-rumor/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rumored</a> to be targeting late 2026 for the launch of the next generation Xbox console. The goal would be to jump ahead of Sony's PlayStation 6, which may not launch until 2028, and grab an advantage with a similar strategy to the Xbox 360, still Microsoft's most successful console to date.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/powera-ops-v3-pro-review-controller/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>I’ve been gaming for 25 years, and in that time, I must have used 100 different controllers. From the run-of-the-mill, stock-standard units to collector’s edition pads, I’ve been around the block when it comes to gaming peripherals. Recently, I had the opportunity to check out the PowerA OPS v3 Pro, a versatile wireless controller designed for use with PC and cloud gaming solutions.</p>



<p>Not only has the OPS v3 Pro impressed me, but it has exceeded every expectation I had right up until the point I was unboxing the controller. When I say that this is Batman’s utility belt in controller form, I mean it – there are so many features and functions packed into this device that it’ll make your head spin.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-no-need-for-improvement">No Need For Improvement</h2>



<p>The PowerA OPS v3 Pro has succeeded in blowing me away in every capacity possible. I knew I was onto a winner when I was unboxing the device, given that it comes packaged in a stylised, eye-popping box that instantly snatches your attention away.</p>



<p>In your hands, the PowerA OPS v3 Pro <strong>feels like </strong>a premium controller. It’s not made of cheap plastic, and it feels durable and hard-wearing. PowerA has printed a branded grip pattern onto rubberised surfaces around the base, top, and sides of the pad, and the black-on-black styling of the controller is a) clean as all hell, and b) gives more credence to the ‘Batman’ link.</p>



<p>This controller utilises PowerA’s ‘Lumectra’ RGB lighting mechanics. There are four individual zones that you can customise with unique modes and a stunning colour palette, all of which happens without any software being needed. If you don’t like the RGB, then you don’t have to have it turned on – simple.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="PowerA OPS v3 Pro Wireless Controller for PC and Cloud Gaming with Lumectra" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YauMt7AqZo0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>







<p>Versatility is the order of the day for the PowerA OPS v3 Pro. With the flick of a switch, you can change between a USB connection, Bluetooth, or a 2.4 GHz connection that’s dependent on a dongle. If you opt to go wireless, you’ll be leaning on a 1200mAh battery that lasts around 30 hours on a full charge.</p>



<p>And on the topic of the battery, the PowerA OPS v3 Pro comes with a magnetic charging stand that’s heavy and powerful enough to fully charge the pad in just three hours. As there’s a switch to flick between profiles, it doesn’t matter what you’re playing or how you’re connected – the controller can accommodate your requirements with ease.</p>



<h2 id="h-features-on-features">Features on Features</h2>



<p>This is where the real fun begins – this PowerA OPS v3 Pro review would be nothing without a breakdown of the insane list of features that go hand-in-hand with the pad.</p>



<p>Firstly, the face inputs and shoulder buttons are all tactile and mechanical, which means they’re responsive, rapid, and offer a satisfying ‘click’ with every press. The triggers feature three-way locks that can be adjusted as needed, ranging from a full pull to an almost mouse-click depth for the fastest response times possible.</p>



<p>If that wasn’t enough, the thumbsticks and triggers all boast Hall Effect sensors.</p>



<p>Thumbsticks, you say? That’s right – the ‘quick-twist’ thumbsticks that are adjustable on the fly, allowing you to adjust the ‘height’ of your sticks in a few fractions of a second.</p>



<p>If you’re looking to become the next pro esports player, you’ll want to make use of the <strong>six mappable buttons </strong>on the PowerA OPS v3 Pro – two on the top and four down where your fingers rest, behind the controller.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>It takes a little getting used to, and if I’m being brutally honest, the ‘extra shoulder buttons’ could be a bit better placed, but they’re tactile, functional, and relatively helpful.</p>



<p>Finally, the PowerA OPS v3 Pro has many hallmark features of customisable controllers. It has a ‘turbo’ button and a handy reset port to take things back to factory settings, and it’s easy enough to disassemble for troubleshooting. With USB-C charging, status lights, instant and low latency connectivity, and a handy braided cable in the box, you’re ready to go from the moment you take hold of this pad.</p>



<p>It does carry a $99.99 prize point, but I think that it’s more than worthwhile. It’s not a bridge too far for me to suggest that this is one of the best controllers I’ve ever used.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/homeworld-3-will-now-see-all-content-being-rolled-out-by-november-under-roadmap-revision/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Blackbird Interactive's Homeworld 3 will undergo a revision in its content roadmap, and all remaining paid/free content will be released in one go.</p>
<p>In an update shared with fans on the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1840080/view/4708039771670613783">game's Steam page,</a> the developers disclosed that they have decided to accelerate their content roadmap after update 1.2. This comes after the title didn't manage to meet its fans' expectations. As of now, Homeworld 3 has received "mostly negative" reviews on Steam simply because players feel that the game lacks core elements and has unimpressive mechanics and gameplay. The developers have decided to haste up things following the negative sentiment to gain interest.</p>
<p><em>Following the release of update 1.2, we made the decision to combine all remaining paid DLC and free content drops in the roadmap into one unified delivery in November. Combining the content into one beat will allow us to focus all our resources and provide you all with a higher-quality experience.</em></p>
<p><em>This change means that, come November, we’ll be releasing two content packs that were originally scheduled for 2025 with the objective of delivering the most complete Homeworld 3 experience and many of your requested changes sooner. In total, you can look forward to three (3) free updates and two (2) paid DLCs worth of content launching as one major update in November.</em></p>

<figure><a href="https://clan.akamai.steamstatic.com/images//41623886/d0ebd79fdf2f4749ea64dea862bc4b75c9e0ec50.png"></a></figure>

<p>This move is simply an attempt to give back to the community what they initially expected with Homeworld 3. Blackbird further elaborates that those who purchased the "One Year Pass" will still get all the new content, including modifications inspired by community requests. One such example is the addition of Hyperspace Jumping in Skirmish mode, along with the choice to choose respective campaign missions. The developers are also bringing several other fan-driven changes, which will undoubtedly put the title in a much better position.</p>
<p>So, for now, fans will have to wait till November to see what Blackbird has in stores, and the company hasn't provided an update on what comes next after this particular update. Still, we'll likely see a slowed-down development by the firm after this one massive update. Make sure to check our review on Homeworld 3 <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/homeworld-3-review/">here</a> if you are interested.</p>

			<p>It's no secret that Xbox has been <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-shipped-61-7-million-units-xbox-series-sold-28-3-ww-as-of-june-2024/">struggling lately</a>, even more so after the <a href="https://wccftech.com/activision-blizzard-layoffs-ftc-complaint/">Activision acquisition</a>, a deal that cost $69 billion to buy the company. This makes it the largest acquisition in gaming but not necessarily the smartest. It's been even more challenging for Xbox, as the overall gaming market has stagnated significantly, primarily due to events like the pandemic, which made the industry even more volatile than it already was. One of the significant factors in the industry now is how inaccessible games are to many people, with blockbuster games costing $70 to purchase as the average gamer. <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/features/2024-09-20/xbox-president-sarah-bond-predicts-the-future-of-microsoft-s-next-game-console" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sarah Bond</a>, the Vice President of Xbox has said that they are now looking into other areas aside from the "traditional gaming business" and aiming to reach into "untapped areas." By discussing her next moves, she's hinted at new Xbox hardware, where Phil Spencer has continuously expressed interest in a handheld device.</p>
<p>Of course, while discussing new hardware, they are also peddling Xbox-exclusive games and promoting their subscriptions, such as the Xbox Game Pass, with a heavier focus now on the subscriptions instead of the consoles. While the Activision acquisition has much potential for Microsoft, Bond must continue to make more sacrifices in the game division. Over 2,650 jobs have been lost this year, adding to the total industry-wide job losses of 11,500.</p>
<p>Despite Microsoft's belief that the Activision acquisition will benefit them in the long run, the gaming unit is operating under a challenging set of revenue and profit goals, as those who are familiar with Xbox's business capabilities state.</p>
<p>Bond is very aware of the challenge ahead of them, saying, "The opportunity on the other side is way bigger for all of us," an opportunity that the company has been fighting for almost a year. A few months after Bond started working at Microsoft, Game Pass was implemented, a subscription service that Microsoft spends $1 billion on yearly to get third-party games.</p>
<p>It's not a secret that most of Microsoft's profits come from the company's other sectors, which have nothing to do with gaming. While the higher-ups who work in these sectors don't know much about gaming, Spencer said, "You could see the board grasp how Xbox could be so much bigger than it is today."</p>
<p>According to Microsoft, Game Pass subscribers spend 50% more on games than non-subscribers, and a large part of the credit goes to Sarah Bond for making the subscription service viable. To this date, Bond still recognizes that she's "making decisions that we're going to live with in the next decade" in an industry that is incredibly volatile and constantly changing.</p>
<p>Although many believe that Xbox won't see another console released, Bond has said that a new console will feature "the largest technical leap you will have ever seen." Whether this will include a handheld console remains to be seen.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/homeworld-3s-coming-paid-dlc-and-free-updates-will-now-all-launch-in-november-instead-of-running-into-2025.988059/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/homeworld-3s-coming-paid-dlc-and-free-updates-will-now-all-launch-in-november-instead-of-running-into-2025<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/homeworld-3">Homeworld 3</a> is condensing its release schedule for post-launch updates. Instead of free and paid content arriving into 2025, it will all - three free updates, and two paid DLCs - arrive together in a "one major update" in November.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"Following the release of update 1.2, we made the decision to combine all remaining paid DLC and free content drops in the roadmap into one unified delivery in November. Combining the content into one beat will allow us to focus all our resources and provide you all with a higher-quality experience," says <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1840080/view/4708039771670613783">the announcement of the roadmap change</a>.
</p><p>
Here's an image which breaks down the new roadmap:

</p><figure>
<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/homeworld-3-roadmap.png?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">
 </a>
<figcaption>Homeworld 3's post-launch content roadmap.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>"With the changes we’re making, we want to assure those of you who purchased the Year One Pass that you will be getting everything we’ve previously promised. Additionally, we've made modifications to our plans to include elements requested by the community," according to the announcement.
</p>
<p>The Year One Pass granted access to three paid DLCs which would expand the co-op War Games mode with new playable factions and artifacts. That's the Kalan Raiders pack, which released in July, and the Somtaaw and Taiidan fleet packs that are now dropping in November. 
</p>
<p>Getting access to some of these updates early is presumably a good thing on its own, but hit the comments on the announcement post and you'll find plenty of players disappointed the Somtaaaw fleet pack only includes two new ships, and concerns that this means the game won't receive further updates past the end of the year.
</p>
<p>In our <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/homeworld-3-review">Homeworld 3 review</a>, Nic found the game sometimes too faithful to its predecessors, but also dinged it for "favouring reaction speed over tactical depth." The November update will include free changes based on community feedback, some of which might help address that particular problem, including the ability for players to decide themselves when they're ready to move onto the next mission, a more linear tech tree, and a reduction in available resources so as to make decisions about what ships to build matter more.

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-finals">The Finals</a>' fourth season approaches. It'll kick off on September 26th, with a new map, a new tutorial and the restoration of Cashout as the core ranked mode. There's a new trailer below, which is worth watching even if you don't play The Finals, says I.

<p>The Finals just has the best trailers in video games right now. I'm sure I've written about this before, but just look at this thing. Almost all of it in-game, showing things you can actually do; the graphic design and way the logos and adverts are intercut or overlayed into the game world; the sound design, like the announcer yelling "Showtime!" being stretched out and overwhelmed by the sounds of action. It's a treat just to watch.
</p>
<p>The action above is taking place within Fortune Stadium, the new map being added for season four, which has three distinct areas based upon the (fictional) corporate sponsors for this season. Naturally, it's fully destructible, as all The Finals' maps are. 
</p>
<p>Season three of The Finals introduced a new mode, Terminal Attack, and made it the game's ranked mode. Apparently it didn't go so well. "We know the switch to Terminal Attack as ranked mode was a misstep. But with missteps come learnings, and while we believe in TA and saw many of you playing and enjoying it, it's just not quite the right fit for our Ranked Play or the core of The Finals," according to the <a href="https://www.reachthefinals.com/patchnotes/s4teaser">official season four announcement post</a>.
</p>
<p>The Finals also introduced the World Tour - designed to be more playful, less competitive than the Ranked matches can be otherwise, while still offering progression - and it continues in season four. The update should also bring a new tutorial, a new battle pass, and the usual tranche of new cosmetics when it launches next week. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

In the 1980s, my childhood was filled with several of these stylized games that integrated comic characters into their gameplay. While Steve Jackson’s cartoonish dungeon crawler Munchkin wasn’t around back then, it is certainly a game I find myself returning to for nostalgia and silliness here and there.</p><p>Munchkin is a cartoon foray into a dungeon featuring a cast of characters from fantasy and reality. The card game is filled with comical art and often witty banter that will have you laughing and probably rolling your eyes at some of the dad jokes. </p><h3>Munchkin Gameplay</h3><p>Gameplay for Munchkin is fairly quick and simple. You start as an ordinary human with a few cards in your initial arsenal of goodies. The cards in your hand, along with others you'll pick up as you play, help you navigate 10 floors of a dungeon by giving you attributes of a specific class and arming you to fight the monsters you'll encounter. You'll employ various zany antics and characteristics against formidable foes as you compete against other players, kicking in doors to fight monsters and gaining loot to increase your power throughout the dungeon run. Which player will reign victoriously in the end? The journey is yours to discover in Munchkin.</p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-toc-title="Featured in This Article">Featured in This Article</h2></p><div data-cy="catalog-view-trigger"><div><p><h3>Munchkin (Core Game)</h3></p></div><div><p><h3>Munchkin 2 - Unnatural Axe</h3></p></div><div><p><h3>Munchkin 3 - Clerical Errors</h3></p></div><div><p><h3>Munchkin 4 - The Need For Steed</h3></p></div><div><p><h3>Munchkin 5 - DeRanged</h3></p></div><div><p><h3>Munchkin 6 - Double Dungeons</h3></p></div><div><p><h3>Munchkin Cthulhu</h3></p></div><div><p><h3>Super Munchkin</h3></p></div><div><p><h3>Munchkin Steampunk</h3></p></div><div><p><h3>Munchkin Zombies</h3></p></div></div><p>Your mission, if you choose to accept it, is to battle your way through the dungeon and get to level 10 before your counterparts.

You can play against friends who also have a copy of the game or against the AI. Games outside of the tutorial can be played with 3-6 players. A single player can choose to go against two or more AI or combinations of AI and human players on the same machine or online.</p><p>One of the key differences between the digital version and the physical version is that you can choose to play without gender-connected items.

A 2014 <a href="https://forums.sjgames.com/showthread.php?t=128984" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">forum post</a> on the Steve Jackson Game website also noted, “Our policy has been consistent and clear: people who want to create digital versions of our games must obtain a license to do so. I'm sorry that you feel this is disrespectful to our fans and customers. We feel exactly as disrespected by people who use our content without our permission.” </p><p>That said, I found the digital version to be worth playing. It also has an <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2392090/Munchkin_Digital__Unnatural_Axe/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">expansion called Unnatural Axe</a> for an additional $4.99, which requires the base game.</p><h2>Bottom Line</h2><p>Munchkin offers some cartoonish art often paired with witty and zany adversaries. In several ways, I’ve found myself enjoying the game. I know several friends who enjoy it for the most part as well. However, as I’ve aged and the years have passed, I’ve found that the game misses the mark in some ways, particularly at the expense of others where it shouldn’t. This seems also to be the case for others on <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/1927/munchkin" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Board Game Geek</a>, as the current rating is only 5.9.</p><p>Gendered items and character designs can take away the enjoyment of some players. I liked how the digital version allowed me to step away from that a bit if I wanted. I wish other physical game versions did. The zany objects and fantastically witty text could be much better with more inclusivity.</p><p><em>Jennifer Stavros is a contributing freelancer for IGN, covering everything from comics, games, technology, and nerd culture.

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/grunn">Grunn</a> is a self-described "extremely normal gardening game", in which you tend to a garden, explore different realities, and try not to die. We've been excited to get our hands on its shears for a while, thanks in part to an excellent demo, and in part due to it being from Sokpop Collective member and Bernband developer Tom van den Boogaart.
</p>
<p>Now it has a release date: October 4th.

<p>"I usually avoid writing sentences that could easily be quoted on a Steam page, but the exquisitely satisfying sound that Grunn’s garden shears make is the exception," <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/deeply-unusual-gardening-game-grunns-shear-snip-deserves-every-award-geoff-keighley-has-ever-invented">wrote Nic about the Grunn demo</a>. "Please feel free to try any of these on for size: Grunn’s shear sound is the Wilhelm Scream of gardening equipment, sure to be referenced for decades to come. Grunn’s shear sound wormed its way past my eyes and into parts of my brain I’d previously assumed could only be accessed by either masterful ASMR or irresponsibly long Q-tips. I used to have anxiety, but now, my only fear in life is that Grunn’s grass will run out, so I no longer have a reason to click away with its shears."
</p>
<p>If you've never played it, Bernband remains a delight. It's a first-person game about exploring a strange, alien city, with no goal other than tourism, which <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-being-pleasantly-lost-bernband">we celebrated back in 2014</a>. Alice O, best of us all, was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/alien-city-game">particularly taken with it</a>.
</p>
<p>Grunn looks to have a bit of that same energy in its village, full of odd, quiet folk living their lives. The Grunn demo remains playable from <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2720950/Grunn/">its Steam page</a>, too. Roll on October 4th.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
