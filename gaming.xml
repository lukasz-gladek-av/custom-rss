			<p>STALKER 2: Heart of Chornobyl <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyl-the-anomaly-never-changes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">launched</a> with several bugs and issues, which GSC Game World, after <a href="https://wccftech.com/stalker-2-has-already-sold-1-million-units/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">celebrating</a> the million units sold milestone, <a href="https://wccftech.com/stalker-2-team-outlines-next-fixes-crashes-bugs-weapon-price-adjustments-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">promised</a> to resolve.</p>
<p>One of the main features that need care is the so-called A-Life AI and spawn system. While we wait to see if the developer will be able to fix it with an official patch, modder ConnerRia <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/stalker2heartofchornobyl/mods/210" target="_blank" rel="noopener">published</a> a mod called The Roadside Panic that aims to greatly improve the lively feeling of the Zone - although it might just kill your game's frame rate in the process. Here's the official overview from the mod's description:</p>
<p><em>This mod restores the chaotic dynamism of the old STALKER games. It also murders your frame rate, so you can enjoy the authentic 30fps 2007 Shadow Of Chernobyl gameplay experience.</em></p>
<ul>
<li><em>Unleashes the full potential of online A-Life</em></li>
<li><em>Heavily mitigates cases of enemies appearing out of thin air right behind you, like in that Reddit clip of the military base everyone keeps talking about</em></li>
<li><em>Significant extension of the A-Life range. NPC and NPC interactions can be seen and heard from afar.</em></li>
<li><em>Different factions will fight for territory at POIs.</em></li>
</ul>
<p><strong><em>How Did You Fix "A-Life"?</em></strong></p>
<p><em>Duct-tape. The AI director in STALKER 2 is actually very complex internally, however its function is gimped because of severe bugs compounding each other. I troubleshooted the present bugs to the extent of my ability and duct-taped a solution to coax the A-Life system into working around its own field of anomalies, so to speak. However, a couple of other issues with the A-Life system are breaking it and causing not only janky behavior but also flat-out non-existent A-Life simulation.</em></p>
<p><em>This mod should prevent or at least mitigate abrupt spawns and it will also deliver immersive A-Life interactions such as NPC-NPC firefights, of course.</em></p>
<p><strong><em>What's The Catch?</em></strong><br>
<em><strong>Performance.</strong> This mod will slaughter your frames in an already unoptimized game. A top-of-the-line CPU is recommended.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Persisting Spawn Issues.</strong> As said before, the director is broken, and all a-life cfg tweaks are doing is finding brute-force methods to circumvent said issues to get more spawns and world events.</em></p>
<p><iframe title="Roadside Panic - Stalker 2 A-Life Demonstration" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/e472boNXfIs?start=4&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>With this mod, you can pick between three download options. The first, Roadside Panic, works at a radius of 800 meters but keeps the squad density of STALKER 2 as-is. The second, called Roadside Panic Lite, works in a 250-meter radius to mitigate bugs. If you're feeling really brave, though, the option for you is Roadside Panic, which works in an 800-meter radius but also cranks up the spawns a lot.</p>
<p>If you opt to try Roadside Panic, let us know in the comments about your experience.</p>

			<p>The development of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vice-city-nextgen-edition-footage-system-requirements/">Grand Theft Auto: Vice City Nextgen Edition</a> mod is almost complete, and the unofficial remaster should be released before the end of the year.</p>
<p>Together with launching a new story-focused trailer, which doesn't feature interior lighting that will be added to the final version of the mod, Revolution Team confirmed that development is 95% complete and is now at the final testing stage. The developer discovered some unforeseen bugs that require fixing, so the mod's release may slip to January 2025, as they want to release the most functional version of the mod possible. Still, they are doing everything they can to get the Nextgen Edition of one of the best entries in the series out before the end of the year.</p>
<p><iframe title="GTA Vice City Nextgen Edition | Story Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZJ9NHFuafDU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The Grand Theft Auto: Vice City Nextgen Edition mod has been in the works for some time, so it's definitely good to hear that development is almost over, as it is setting out to be one of the best ways to experience the classic open-world game developed by Rockstar Games complete with visuals and gameplay enhancements.</p>
<p>Those who cannot play Grand Theft Auto: Vice City Nextgen Edition are still able to experience a remastered version of the game with the GTA Trilogy Definitive Edition remasters. The compilation was updated <a href="https://wccftech.com/gta-trilogy-definitive-edition-patch-classic-lighting-mode/">earlier this month</a> with some enhancements only available for the mobile version of the compilation up until this month that address some of the issues of the PC and console release. You can learn more about it and the issues that plagued it at launch in our <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/grand-theft-auto-the-trilogy-the-definitive-edition/">review.</a></p>

		<p><em>On Monday, F1 and General Motors announced that they had agreed that GM would join the F1 grid as a brand new team, a surprising turn of events given that a nearly identical pitch involving GM and the Andretti Global racing organization was rejected back in January of this year. It’s the kind of opaque political maneuvering that makes F1 so irresistible to me, and as I was researching the topic <u>for </u></em><a href="https://www.patreon.com/shiftf1?ref=remapradio.com" rel="noreferrer"><em><u>Shift</u></em></a><em><u>+F1</u> </em>prior to recording<em>, I ended up writing out why I think things turned out this way… and why I think F1 might end up regretting making General Motors so central to this expansion.</em></p><p>After stonewalling Andretti Global's attempts to enter Formula 1 racing for over two years, the sport is now <a href="https://www.formula1.com/en/latest/article/statement-on-general-motors-application-to-join-fia-formula-one-world.69uoRF1uwHwXkr4efkpnhc?ref=remapradio.com"><u>welcoming General Motors</u></a> into the sport as the 11th team on the grid for 2026. In light of the fact that this is substantively be the same Andretti bid that F1’s leadership rejected before, it’s worth wondering whether the value of the GM and Cadillac badges was the decisive factor for F1 leadership, or if it was removing the liability of the Andretti connection.</p><p>The argument from F1’s chieftains has always been that, if the sport was going to grant a highly-coveted new spot on its grid to a new team, the team needed to come in as a serious contender and bring real value to the sport. They wanted a high-quality “works” team, one that has the technical and manufacturing wherewithal to produce an entire Formula 1 machine from end-to-end, especially the complicated and ruinously expensive power units. The fact that Andretti’s bid was bolstered by a promise to partner with GM wasn’t sufficient for the opposition that had gathered to Andretti’s efforts. The Andretti F1 car would be sourcing its engine from another supplier (at least at the outset), like most of the current F1 grid, and there was wariness about how seriously GM was in its intentions to take an active role in its partnership with Andretti.</p><figure></figure><p>Behind that reasoning was a blatant distaste toward Andretti Autosport, and particularly toward the Andrettis themselves. Mario Andretti might be a living legend who won races with just about every kind of machinery he ever touched, but he is not quite as beloved figure in F1 as he in the United States… and his son Michael’s reputation in the sport <a href="https://www.roadandtrack.com/motorsports/a25684703/michael-andretti-f1-1993/?ref=remapradio.com"><u>was marred by his grim stint at McLaren</u></a> prior to being replaced by Mika Hakkinen. Yet it was the way he came across as owner and executive at his motorsports company that truly turned the sport against him.</p><p>Something about the way Michael Andretti <a href="https://www.autosport.com/f1/news/why-f1-and-teams-are-still-not-impressed-by-andrettis-new-team-plans/10418580/?ref=remapradio.com"><u>lobbied to secure support for his team’s bid</u></a> was off-putting to the leadership of the F1 grid. In many ways, the response to Andretti was anachronistic, like the Andrettis were <em>nouveau riche </em>Americans of the 19th century, hunting for a place in European society.&nbsp;</p><p>Except it might not be quite as easy to reduce it to a simple matter of bluff, assertive Americans repelling the reserved Europeans they set out to charm. Zak Brown has led McLaren for a decade, Otmar Szafnauer was a well-regarded team principle (though I have always suspected his stock was likewise diminished by his very midwestern lack of pretension, which seems like it was not what board room “alpha” wannabes like Lawrence Stroll and Laurent Rossi wanted from a direct report). Rather than coming across as respectful or considerate, Andretti's attempts to persuade other team owners to welcome his efforts to join the F1 grid, he seems to have struck his peers as presumptuous and manipulative.</p><p>More important than Andretti’s initial unctuousness was the way the organization was also desperately bargain-hunting. Andretti was willing to pay <a href="https://www.motorsport.com/f1/news/200m-andretti-plans-f1-entry/10303590/?ref=remapradio.com"><u>an anti-dilution fee</u></a> of $200M to the other teams on the F1 grid to make up for the fact a ten way revenue split would become an eleven way split, but the fee was seen as too small in light of the current value of a spot on the F1 grid (the fact that owner Liberty Media’s takes half the sport’s revenue off the top and teams would end up losing money if the sport’s health and popularity draws more entrants is another topic for another day).&nbsp;</p><p>Andretti may also have erred critically by soliciting, or maybe just having the misfortune receive, <a href="https://www.skysports.com/f1/news/12433/12979350/andretti-fia-president-mohammed-ben-sulayem-confident-formula-1-will-approve-new-team?ref=remapradio.com"><u>the blessing of the FIA and its increasingly unpopular chairman</u></a> Mohamed Ben Sulayem. After a misfiring charm offensive, it would not be surprising if F1’s leadership was thoroughly alienated by Andretti’s efforts with the FIA and then with the press to paint the other F1 teams as acting out of <a href="https://www.autosport.com/f1/news/andretti-says-greed-is-behind-f1-negativity-of-entry-plans/10419099/?ref=remapradio.com"><u>pure greed and bad faith</u></a>, a charge which attracted warnings of <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/house-republican-jim-jordan-f1-investigation-andretti-us-rcna151103?ref=remapradio.com"><u>an anti-trust investigation</u></a> from Congress.</p>

<p>The bulk of Call of Duty: Black Ops 6’s marketing features The Replacer. The bearded character appears in various BLOPS 6 trailers and spoofs, but his origins are confusing to many—so let’s tell you everything you need to know about The Replacer.</p>



<p>Treyarch brought back the iconic character for <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/black-ops-6-guides/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Ops 6</a>—marking the first time The Replacer has been seen since Black Ops 4. The character has been used in various pre-release trailers, depicted as a replacement for real people in everyday life.</p>



<p>The Replacer’s face has become synonymous with CoD, and I’m here to dive into who he is, the actor behind the role, and more.</p>



<h2 id="h-who-is-the-replacer-character-in-black-ops-6">Who is The Replacer Character in Black Ops 6?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Irreplaceable. Credit to Activision</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>The Replacer is a fictional character created specifically for the Call of Duty universe and was first seen in Black Ops 2.</strong></p>



<p>With CoD’s reputation continuing to grow and its popularity soaring at an unfathomable rate, The Replacer debuted in a marketing trailer to hype up new BLOPS 2 content. In the video, The Replacer steps into the shoes of normal people going about their day to “replace” them, allowing the person to enjoy Black Ops 2 instead.</p>



<p>The hot reception for The Replacer resulted in the persona returning for Black Ops 3, and Black Ops 4, and they have returned for 2024’s Black Ops 6. Again, following the same ideology; players desperate to play Black Ops 6 can call upon his services to step in and fulfill their day-to-day duties.</p>



<p>If only The Replacer was real, he could be here writing this while I kick back and camp Hardpoints!</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-unlock-the-replacer-in-black-ops-6">How to Unlock The Replacer in Black Ops 6</h2>



<p><strong>You unlock The Replacer in Black Ops 6 by purchasing the Tracer Pack: The Replacer Bundle from the BLOPS 6 Store.</strong></p>



<p>The bundle costs <strong>2,400 CoD Points</strong> and includes:</p>



<ul>
<li>The Replacer Operator Skin</li>



<li>Blueprints</li>



<li>Finishing Move</li>



<li>Charm</li>



<li>Calling Card</li>



<li>Sticker</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-who-is-peter-stormare-in-black-ops-6">Who is Peter Stormare in Black Ops 6?</h2>



<p><strong>Peter Stormare is a Swedish-born actor playing the role of The Replacer in the Call of Duty: Black Ops series.</strong></p>



<p>The actor’s legendary portfolio of acting credits—thanks to <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001780/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">IMDB</a>—stretches across TV, movies, and video games. Focusing on the latter, as well as The Replacer in Call of Duty, Peter Stormare has had voice roles in <strong>The Elder Scrolls: Online</strong> as King Joruun, <strong>Destiny 2</strong> as Arach Jalaal, and <strong>Until Dawn</strong> as Dr. Hill.</p>

            <p>
PlayStation is celebrating its upcoming 30th Anniversary by letting you sit on its logo while riding the Victoria Line.
</p>
<p>
The marketing stunt is the first time in over 25 years that Transport for London has allowed a brand to advertise on its Tube seats. It's also probably the first time in over 25 years that TFL has actually put in new Tube seats.
</p>
<p>
Sony's design includes the classic Circle, Square, Cross and Triangle buttons emblazoned across the Tube's usual moquette seat cushions. (Today I learned that the correct name for this type of fabric is indeed "moquette". Impress your friends.)
</p>
<p>
Here's how it all looks:
</p> <div>

<p><span data-type="targeting">

</span>
</p></div>
<p>
Somewhat oddly, PlayStation has also suggested people should kiss while sat on these seats. I will continue staring at the ground trying to ignore everyone else as normal, but thank you anyway Sony.
</p> <div>

</p></div>
<p>
Keen to spot the PlayStation Tube branding for yourself? You might find it more difficult than it first appears. Reading further, it seems like just one carriage on the Victoria Line has been given the PlayStation spruce-up. With 36 trains operating per hour, that might take a while to find.
</p><p>
This isn't the first time PlayStation has teamed up with TFL. Back in 2020, Sony took over the Tube signs outside Oxford Circus by replacing those with the Circle, Square, Cross and Triangle designs to promote the launch of PS5. Finding these signs was easier than finding an actual PS5 at the time.

<p>
And before that, PlayStation memorably stuck its favourite buttons up on London's Oxo Tower back in 2013, to celebrate the launch of PS4.

PlayStation celebrates its 30th anniversary next week, on Tuesday 3rd December, when it will have been three decades since the launch of the original PS1 in Japan. Eurogamer will be marking the occaison here too - stay in your PlayStation-branded seats for much more.
</p>
<p>Yesterday, it was reported that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-reportedly-prepping-playstation-5-portable-plans-to-battle-nintendos-handheld-dominance">Sony is quietly prepping plans to re-enter the handheld gaming market with a portable PS5</a> that's set to rival <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-everything-we-know">Switch 2</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>The Callisto Protocol PS5 Pro patch greatly enhanced image quality and performance while also introducing an 8K resolution mode that delivers a visual experience without compromise, according to a new analysis of the patch.</p>
<p>During the latest episode of their <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vez2JZxDYSg" target="_blank" rel="noopener">weekly podcast</a>, Digital Foundry provided their own analysis of the PS5 Pro patch released for Striking Distance's game, highlighting how the patch improves Performance Mode considerably by adding the ray tracing features only available in Quality Mode on the base model while maintaining a solid 60 FPS framerate. This is seemingly achieved by lowering the resolution, as on the mid-generation console, the pixel count hits 1440p and 1296p in areas where it is higher on the base model's Performance mode, although the image is definitely sharper on the new system. In addition, the game also achieves better performance on the new PlayStation 5 model by using TAAU instead of AMD FSR 2 or PSSR, as the artifacts that indicate that either are being used are nowhere to be seen. As such, it is not clear if Striking Distance simply used the additional GPU power of the system to brute force these improvements in some ways or had access to the PS5 Po exclusive features that can only be used with more recent SDK versions.</p>
<p>Digital Foundry also examined the 8K mode introduced in The Callisto Protocol with the PS5 Pro patch. This mode is not as impressive as the No Man's Sky 8K mode, as it features a slightly sharper image than the 4K resolution mode and not much else. As such, Digital Foundry theorizes that this mode employs a dynamic resolution range that hits up to 6K and then upscales the image to 8K.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Xbox killing avatars on PC, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S]]></title>
            <link>https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-killing-avatars-on-pc-xbox-one-xbox-series-xs</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/xbox-killing-avatars-on-pc-xbox-one-xbox-series-x-s.1045413/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-killing-avatars-on-pc-xbox-one-xbox-series-xs<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>
Microsoft will shutdown its Xbox Avatar Editor app on PC, Xbox One and Xbox Series X/S on 9th January due to "low engagement", the company has said. 
</p>
<p>
This means you'll no longer be able to access or edit your Xbox Avatar, and you'll lose any purchased cosmetic items for them. Any money spent on avatar items will be refunded.
</p>
<p>
After 9th January, Xbox Avatars will disappear from profile pages, Microsoft has <a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/help/account-profile/profile/xbox-avatar-editor-app-faq">said</a>. So, if you want to snap one last Gamerpic using your digital self, now's the time. 
</p>
<p>
The good news here is this solely refers to the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-what-the-revamped-and-diverse-new-xbox-avatars-look-like">newer Xbox Avatars, launched in 2018 for the Xbox One era</a>. Microsoft's entirely separate and confusingly distinct Xbox Original Avatars are unaffected.
</p>
<p>
If you still remember (or use!) your Xbox 360, you'll remember having an avatar there, too. These avatars are what Microsoft now calls Xbox Original Avatars, and they were far more ingrained within Xbox 360's ecosystem. Some Xbox 360 games let you play as your avatar, for example, while others offered cosmetic avatar rewards via a system akin to Achievements.
</p>
<p>
Again, the Xbox 360-era Original Avatars are not going anywhere - hopefully because switching them off would be more of a headache when it comes to game preservation and back compatibility.
</p>
<p>
Back during the troubled times of the Xbox One, Microsoft pivoted back to using avatars and spent time creating an all-new system that offered a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-avatars-just-got-a-lot-more-diverse">far more diverse range of options and deeper customisation</a>. This included support for prosthetics, wheelchairs and gender neutral clothing, plus colour combinations for that can stretch to "almost eighty octillion", Microsoft said at the time.
</p><p>
"Microsoft is dedicated to delivering great experiences for players, including a variety of options to personalise their gaming experience with Xbox," Microsoft said in a statement now. "Due to low engagement and our shift in focus towards delivering other player experiences, the Xbox Avatar Editor app will no longer be available starting on 9th January, 2025.
</p>
<p>"Players can still personalise their gaming experience with dynamic backgrounds and profile colours on Xbox consoles, and with Xbox Original Avatars, profile themes, and gamerpics on Xbox consoles and PCs."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/bioshock">BioShock</a> and Mafia publisher 2K has killed off its PC  launcher, and uncoupled its top titles from the software.
</p>
<p>
Steam and Epic Games Store versions of BioShock Remastered, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/bioshock-2">BioShock 2</a> Remastered, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/bioshock-infinite">BioShock Infinite</a>, Mafia Trilogy Definitive Edition, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/sid-meiers-civilization-v">Civilization 5</a> and 6, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-quarry">The Quarry</a>, XCOM 2, XCOM: Chimera Squad and Marvel's Midnight Suns will now run without the 2K Launcher opening first.
</p>
<p>
In a <a href="https://support.2k.com/hc/en-us/articles/34845053169939--2K-Launcher-Complete-Sunset#h_01JB9Z24V9Q3426C558WRC173K">blog post</a> on the changes, 2K said its launcher had now been removed from every game that used it on Epic and Steam. Last night, an update was sent out to 2K games on Steam to ensure its removal - in case you wondered why BioShock was patched again.
</p>
<p>
From 2K's notes on the subject, the whole thing sounds like it should be pretty seamless. If you're still seeing the 2K Launcher now, be sure you've updated your games and rebooted Steam. 
</p>
<p>
Access to your games, as well as your save files, should continue uninterrupted, 2K says in a Q&amp;A on the subject. 
</p>
<p>
"Can I still use the 2K Launcher if I want to?" a final question asks. "We currently have no plans to allow an optional 2K Launcher setting, but we appreciate your interest," is the response.
</p>
<p>
2K's next games include Civilization 7 and BioShock creator Ken Levine's mysterious Judas, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bioshock-creators-next-game-judas-to-be-released-by-march-2025">whenever that finally materialises</a>. When it does do so, however, it will be without the 2K Launcher.

            <p>Nintendo has added <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom">The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</a> to the official series timeline.</p>
<p>The adorable top-down game is part of the 'Hero is defeated' timeline, slotting in behind Tri-Force Heroes and the original The Legend of Zelda.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/jp/character/zelda/en/history/index.html">timeline</a> links (pun intended) all the games together, famously splitting after <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-legend-of-zelda-ocarina-of-time">Ocarina of Time</a> depending on whether the hero is successful or not at saving the world.</p>

<p>So what does this mean for Echoes of Wisdom? I'm yet to finish it myself, though in all honesty we all know the timeline is incredibly loose and somewhat meaningless.</p>
<p>Worryingly, though, after Echoes of Wisdom Nintendo specifies a "Decline of Hyrule Kingdom". What happened? What did you do Zelda?</p>

<p>Back in September, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-officially-places-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-tears-of-the-kingdom-outside-series-established-timeline">Nintendo officially listed both Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom outside of the established timeline</a>, with no relation to previous games.</p>
<p>Further, in a recent interview with <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/video-games/2024/11/12/zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-eiji-aonuma/">The Washington Post</a>, series producer Eiji Aonuma stated Zelda games are developed from a gameplay perspective first, with story formed later. So how much does the timeline really matter?</p>
<p>Echoes of Wisdom was released on Switch back in September, and is the first game in the series to feature the titular princess as the playable protagonist.</p>
<p>Zelda voice actor Patricia Summersett told <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda/after-echoes-of-wisdom-zelda-actor-says-having-the-princess-as-the-playable-character-in-a-breath-of-the-wild-style-open-world-game-would-be-amazing/">GamesRadar</a> it would be "amazing" to see the princess as protagonist in an open world Zelda too. "I'm so happy for the fandom that they got Echoes of Wisdom, of course, but I mean, yeah, there can always be more playable Zelda as far as I'm concerned," she said.</p>
<p>"Thanks to playful puzzles and an imaginative reinvention of Hyrule's historic iconography, Echoes of Wisdom emerges as a bold and creative new chapter in Zelda's legend," reads our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-review-a-rebellious-remix-of-past-and-present">Echoes of Wisdom review</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>In philosophy there are several thought experiments to test how you might respond to complex moral conundrums. Perhaps the most famous of these is the trolley problem – if forced to choose, would you choose to sacrifice one life to save many? This initial question seems simple at first glance, but once more information is layered in (the single person is a doctor who might find the cure for cancer, the many are convicted criminals etc.) we find that our decision can change. Threshold feels like a gaming equivalent of this kind of thought experiment, and its atmosphere and moral ambiguity has stayed with me since I finished it the first of several times.</p>
<p><iframe title="THRESHOLD – Release Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jAqq9qqq5XQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Threshold is the brainchild of solo developer, Julien Eveillé, and is the latest in a series of fantastic indie games published by Critical Reflex, hot on the heels of the viral <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rQMCO84f03Y">Mouthwashing</a>. Threshold more than holds its own in such lauded company and is one of the most thought provoking and troubling games I’ve played this year.</p>


<p>The game starts with you seeming to be buried and put in the position of choosing a new name – the catch being that you only have two letters to fill. This small detail immediately prevents you from fully identifying with the character you will play as (unless you happen to have a particularly short name or nickname, I guess). To further the sense of defamiliarisation &nbsp;there is not just a simple difficulty select option available here either. You can choose between focused and distracted modes which make environmental clues harder or easier to spot, but the actual difficulty is set by choosing a country’s flag. There is no indication as to the effect of this choice and I look forward to the inevitable long form video essays delving into the various effects.</p>


<p>Once you start the game proper you are given a very basic overview of your duties in your new job. There is a mysterious train forever moving forward across the threshold station you control, entering a tunnel through an intimidating concrete wall. To ensure the train’s safe passage, you must blow a whistle through a foghorn style amplifier to speed it up when it slows down. You’re not told what the train is carrying or why it must maintain a certain speed, just that it is your job to control it. The moral quandary starts to unravel as you discover clues and notes that suggest that all is not quite what it seems.</p>
<p>Graphically, Threshold makes effective use of the lo-fi PS1 style that is increasingly popular at the moment. The sharp edges and blocky polygons help to give everything an uncanny feel, and the drab palette perfectly suits the mood of daily drudgery. The piercing alarm that sounds when the train is not at its optimal speed is the most pressing reminder of your duties, an alarm that is made even more effective by the relative silence of the game. The background rumble of the train is your main companion, as even your co-worker relays information purely through written notes.</p>

<p>The in-game reasoning for the lack of voice acting is an ingenious part of the world building. The station you are manning is high up and therefore the oxygen levels are very low. This lack of oxygen becomes a key mechanic as simply moving around the map leaves you breathless, and blowing the all important whistle takes a lot of oxygen each time. To combat your breathlessness you must collect and use oxygen canisters, but even this aspect only serves to deepen the feeling of dread and despair.</p>
<p>Rather than conventional gas canisters, the oxygen you collect comes in the form of gas tubes that you must bite into in order to release the air within. The effects of this mechanic are reflected in the constant graphic of your mouth on screen, a mouth that becomes increasingly bloodied and disfigured as you use more air. This perpetual reminder of the ill effects of your job is open to all sorts of interpretation about the alienating process of capitalist systems, and/or just a cool bit of body horror.</p>
<p>Saying much more about the way the game develops is especially difficult as it is an experience that really needs you to go in as uninformed as possible.&nbsp;Any further discussion of mechanics or plot developments risks spoiling the game, an issue perhaps exacerbated by the relatively short time it takes to play it through. If you explore thoroughly and look for as many clues as you can then it’ll take you about 90 minutes for a playthrough, and there are several different endings to unlock. A short run time is always a risky choice given the way the refund system on Steam works, but I would urge you to try out different approaches to get the full effect of the game’s complex meditation on choice and consequences.</p>

		<p>Summary</p><p>
		Threshold is a game that deserves to find an audience that will truly appreciate its provocative and philosophical approach and represents another excellent title in Critical Reflex’s library. The opening credits claim that it is a true story and this detail in particular has lead me to speculate on possible metaphorical interpretations ranging from the highly personal to the global political. It is rare for a game to make you think quite this much and that is meant as high praise.	</p></div>

			<p>Activision and developer Treyarch have proudly <a href="https://x.com/CallofDuty/status/1861092582257807478" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> that Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 is the biggest entry in the already massive franchise one month after its release. That's counting figures like total players, hours played, and total matches. Interestingly, the actual numbers were not shared, but they must be massive, given the IP.</p>
<p>The news is not surprising, given the great <a href="https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-sets-franchise-and-game-pass-records/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">start</a> in the game's first week. Black Ops 6 also registered new records for <a href="https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-has-drawn-in-most-traffic-ever-for-a-game-launch-in-the-uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Internet traffic in the UK</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-witnesses-52-of-total-us-xbox-players-checking-it-out-a-new-record/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">US Xbox players</a> checking out the game, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/us-games-consumer-spending-up-by-10-after-black-ops-6-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">drove US spending on games up by 10%</a>. Certainly, the fact that this is the first time a new Call of Duty game has launched on Game Pass helped a lot with setting new total player, hour played, and total match records.</p>
<p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 received Wccftech's seal of approval from Kai Tatsumoto's review, too. Here's what he had to say about the latest entry in the shooter series:</p>
<p><em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 represents a proper return to form, with Treyarch taking the helm in development once more. This is probably as definitive a Call of Duty title has been in years, with a package that executes well across all three pillars of Campaign, Multiplayer, and Zombies. While the narrative doesn’t hold up to the spy thriller premise in the lead-up to launch, the online package rounds out the experience well.</em></p>
<p><em>Treyarch has arrived guns blazing with this year's Call of Duty entry. All three pillars of Campaign, Multiplayer, Zombies are among the best they've been in years. While some players might lament the addition of Omnimovement to the gunfights, there's a dynamic feel to the new mechanics that make Call of Duty feel more like a personal action movie.</em></p>
<p>What do you think about the new Call of Duty? Are you enjoying it? Let us know in the comments.</p>

            <p>When and where did the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2711290/New_Life/">Steam demo</a> for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-horror-games">horror</a> game <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/new-life">New Life</a> first find its way to me? When did its non-descript, black hooded protagonist first wriggle, with the transgressive delight of an unbidden slug between naked toes embarking on a 2am fridge odyssey, into the as yet uncolonised crevices of my ‘demos’ library? The specifics, I fear, are but the fumes of memories, lingering like armies of mice in trenchcoats at supermarket cheese sample platters, at once painfully obvious and immune to detection in their uncanny shroud of stifling human decorum. "For who is madder?!" I shout, in a normal and cool manner. "The mice - so very mad for cheese - or the madmen who screams ‘Mice! Mice!’ in the middle of the cheese aisle?!"</p>
<p>And if I can’t remember how it got here, how can I make it go away?</p>
<!--more-->
<p>I no longer wish to play the demo for New Life, if indeed I ever did. I find its presence ugly in ways that transcend how naturally ugly it is, which is the very thing I think made me want to play it in the first place. I find its description deeply unnerving in its unadorned simplicity. "A creepy story about a guy," it begins. Immediately, I am beset by visions of Poe. Of Shelley. Of Lovecraft. Of Chambers. Of scholarly ink spilled in wasteful abandon, of frenzied efforts to elucidate and quantify the terror the dwells in every human heart. "What folly!" I spit between mouthfuls of Tesco brand choco hoops, helplessly watching the murky impostor milk dribble down my juddering chin, coagulating with my tears of enraged bafflement. "What utter madness!".</p>
<p>For what is all horror if not, in some small way, a creepy story about a guy?</p>
<p>"Immerse yourself in the dark adventure of a guy who suffers from depression and feels guilty. He never takes off his hood and always keeps his hands in his pockets," it continues. "Michael became disillusioned with life and decided to try to start his life over. To do this, he left the metropolis and a successful career, sold the house he inherited, and moved to the other side of the country to forget the mistakes made in the past. But is it possible to escape from your past?"</p><p>Is it possible indeed? Day after day, I set myself the task of clearing the clutter from my library. A demo I’ve played and do not wish to play again. A demo that has tempted me to buy the full game. A demo I have poured my heart into writing about to extol its virtues, burning with ecstatic fire as words tumble unbidden to the page, only for the sole piece of evidence that I did not imagine the entire affair to be a single RPS comment that says “looks shit M8”. And then, there is the demo for New Life. Haunting me like all unfulfilled aspirations must eventually: relentlessly. Viciously. Eternally.</p>
<p>I move the cursor. I right click and hover over the ‘uninstall’ button. I have no wish to return here, to this place between play and un-play, as long as I live. But still, I cannot leave. "What if?" I ask. "What then?". The demo is too small to concern myself with the space it takes, and yet, too monumental in its shrieking insistence to ignore. And in this place between oblivion and absolution, I scrape out a wretched existence, with no end in sight.</p>
<p>(I will probs just leave it there tbf it’s a very small demo)</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/the-2k-launcher-is-no-more-you-can-now-launch-2ks-pc-games-directly-in-steam<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">2K Games has pulled its launcher from all its PC games as part of a “complete sunset” of the software, which means PC gamers can now launch all 2K games directly in Steam.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The 2K Launcher was forced upon players of the company’s PC games, including Firaxis’ <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/sid-meiers-civilization-v">Civilization 5</a>, Mafia Trilogy Definitive Edition, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/xcom-2">XCOM 2</a>. Following an update this month, the 2K Launcher is removed from every game that used it on Epic and Steam. 2K also removed the 2K Launcher Beta, a completely separate launcher, from Civilization 5.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This means Bioshock Remastered, Bioshock 2 Remastered, Bioshock Infinite, The Quarry, and Marvel’s Midnight Suns will now all launch directly into the game as soon as you click Play. The Mafia Trilogy Definitive Edition games on Steam and the Mafia Trilogy Definitive Edition games on Epic each have slightly different paths to getting into the games.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Civilization 6 on Steam had the launcher removed earlier this year, so no additional steps are needed. But for Civilization 6 for Epic, it now directly opens into the game when launched from Epic. Civilization 5, meanwhile, now uses the Steam Launch options to open the game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">XCOM 2 for Steam is a special case, 2K said, <a href="https://support.2k.com/hc/en-us/articles/34883894563347--XCOM-2-2K-Launcher-Sunset-and-Removal" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">as the launcher included Mod support functionality</a>. Of note, these changes will let you enable mods on the Steam Deck. XCOM 2 on Epic will now open the Original XCOM 2 Mod Launcher. <a href="https://support.2k.com/hc/en-us/articles/34884258027411--XCOM-Chimera-Squad-2K-Launcher-Sunset-and-Removal" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">XCOM: Chimera Squad also has the Mod launcher as optional</a>, with a secondary option available to directly launch the game. Mods are also available on Steam Deck for Chimera Squad.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In a <a href="https://support.2k.com/hc/en-us/articles/34845053169939--2K-Launcher-Complete-Sunset#h_01JB9YZ0QXK5J6CQVJXJ8P73H9" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">blog post</a>, 2K said it had replaced the 2KLauncher folder with a text file called 2kLauncherRemoved.txt, which can be safely deleted. But there may be more for you to do — 2K said to be sure the launcher is gone for good, close and reopen Steam then reboot your PC.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We've done the heavy lifting, but to take it all the way home there might be one step left for you,” 2K explained. “First thing is to try closing and reopening Steam - that means completely closing and not just using the X to minimize the platform. Rebooting your PC is a good way to be sure it happened. For Epic, just make sure you've downloaded the most recent update for the game.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Saved games shouldn’t be impacted, and you won’t lose access to any of your games, as long as you bought them on Steam or Epic. And, for those (probably very few!) PC gamers who miss the 2K Launcher for some reason and want to continue using it, unfortunately it’s not coming back. “We currently have no plans to allow an optional 2K Launcher setting, but we appreciate your interest,” 2K said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The end of the 2K Launcher comes ahead of the release of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/sid-meiers-civilization-vii">Civilization 7</a> in February 2025. Civilization is usually one of the most popular PC games around, so fans can rest assured they’ll be able to launch it directly in Steam.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">PC gamers have long criticized publisher launchers, including Ubisoft and EA’s, that force themselves upon players before they can get into the game. It seems unlikely the end of the 2K Launcher will spark a mass removal of PC launchers, however, given they’re often used for cloud saves or storefronts.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

            <p>Is the next big video game company acquisition on the cards?</p>
<p>Last week, news broke that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-in-talks-to-buy-elden-ring-dark-souls-developer-fromsoftware">Sony was in talks to buy FromSoftware parent company Kadokawa</a>. A day later, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fromsoftware-owner-kadokawa-acknowledges-takeover-interest-from-sony">Kadokawa acknowledged that takeover interest</a>. Should it be accepted, this would likely be the biggest video game acquisition since Microsoft bought <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/activision-blizzard">Activision Blizzard</a> and Sony itself bought Destiny-maker Bungie.</p>
<p>FromSoftware is of course known for its Souls games and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-walkthrough-8042">Elden Ring</a>, and already has an established relationship with Sony due to exclusives like Bloodborne and Demon's Souls. Yet Kadokawa not only owns other developers, such as <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/octopath-traveler">Octopath Traveler</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mario-and-luigi-brothership">Mario &amp; Luigi: Brothership</a> developer Acquire, it's a major name in anime and manga too - an area Sony already has considerable claim to with its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-set-to-buy-crunchyroll-for-nearly-usd1bn">acquisition of Crunchyroll</a>.</p>
<p>So what's the likelihood of this acquisition being accepted? What does Kadokawa - and by extension FromSoftware - stand to gain from Sony ownership? And does this mean Bloodborne fans will finally get the re-release they so desperately crave?</p>
<p>Joining me to discuss the possible consequences of this acquisition on this week's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/topics/newscast">Eurogamer Newscast</a> are news reporters Victoria Kennedy and Vikki Blake.</p>

            <p>A studio led by former <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mass-effect">Mass Effect</a> director Casey Hudson have shut down before being able to show the sci-fi narrative adventure they were working on. Humanoid Origin posted the announcement of the studio's closure <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/humanoid-origin_earlier-today-we-informed-our-staff-that-activity-7266889657370447874-9uwE">on LinkedIn yesterday</a>, saying that a "shortfall of funding" was responsible for the decision. They had been making a "multi-platform AAA game, focusing on character-driven narrative in an all-new science-fiction universe", according to the studio's website.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"Earlier today, we informed our staff that Humanoid Origin will be shutting down," said the post. "Despite efforts to shield the studio from broader challenges in the industry, an unexpected shortfall of funding left us unable to sustain operations.</p>
<p>"We’re heartbroken that we will not be able to bring our new science-fiction universe to completion. Our main concern at this time however is for our team, and we are committed to supporting them in their transition to new employment."</p>
<p>All they had shown of the game thus far were a few pieces of concept art, which you can still see in the background if you scroll down <a href="https://humanoidorigin.com/">the studio's website</a>. The game was being made in Unreal Engine 5, and they were <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7193696886300512257/">hiring for roles</a> as recently as six months ago. </p><p>For background, Casey Hudson set up <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/former-bioware-manager-casey-hudson-has-founded-a-new-studio">his own studio in 2021</a>, after leaving BioWare <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bioware-veterans-casey-hudson-and-mark-darrah-have-left-the-studio">alongside fellow veteran Mark Darrah</a>. Those with a good memory (not me) will recall that this was the second time Hudson had departed from BioWare - he previously had a stint away from the company in 2014-2017 before <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/mass-effect-lead-casey-hudson-returns-to-bioware-as-general-manager">returning as general manager</a>. What he and others will do now that Humanoid Origin are closing down, we don't know yet.  </p>
<p>This is not the first studio closure we've seen in recent months. Sony <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/sony-write-off-ill-fated-200-million-shooter-concord-as-a-loss-by-closing-studio-permanently">shut down Firewalk Studios</a>, the makers of ill-fated shooter <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/concord">Concord</a>, in October. And Tequila Works, the developers of Rime, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tequila-works-the-studio-behind-rime-and-the-sexy-brutale-has-filed-for-insolvency">filed for insolvency</a> earlier this month. Alongside other <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/topics/layoffs">layoffs</a>, most recently at <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/steamworld-makers-announce-100-layoffs-cancel-projects-and-say-theyll-publish-more-games-by-other-studios-but-fewer-of-their-own">Thunderful Games</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/layoffs-hit-workers-at-reflector-entertainment-makers-of-unknown-9-awakening">Reflector Entertainment</a>, these closures mark the autumn of a year that has proven even more harsh on developers than 2023. A site that tracks job losses estimates that <a href="https://publish.obsidian.md/vg-layoffs/Archive/2024">there have been 14,000 layoffs</a> so far this year, compared with a total of 10,500 last year, as our sister site Eurogamer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mass-effect-director-casey-hudsons-aaa-sci-fi-game-cancelled-studio-closing">point out</a>. It's likely the real number for both years is higher, as some layoffs may go unreported, and freelance folks working on contract may also not be counted.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>In an exclusive report published by Arizton, it was predicted that the global esports market will be worth more than $5 billion within the next five years. This growth is represented by a huge CAGR of 17.48%, making esports one of the fastest-growing and most lucrative industries in the world.</p>



<p>To put that into perspective, the American Football industry boasts a CAGR of around 6.9%, and the global music market has an estimated CAGR of 7.8%, running to 2029.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-time-to-invest">Time to Invest</h2>



<p>The world of esports is a tumultuous one, and from day to day, things remain fairly volatile. However, it’s one of the fastest-developing markets in the world, and historically, some huge investments have been made into the wider industry.</p>



<p>In the recent report published by Arizton, it was revealed that the esports market, which was worth $1.96 billion in 2023, could be worth as much as $5.17 billion by 2029. </p>



<p><a href="https://www.arizton.com/market-reports/global-esports-market" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">This report</a> spoke about the success of various tournaments, like the League of Legends World Championship, and the ‘adoption of digitisation’, which is a global cultural shift that’s seeing the people of our world become one that’s always connected to an online device in some way.</p>



<p>Arizton revealed that MOBA is king in the esports space and that North America is the place to be for esports businesses. It was documented that 44% of the global esports market share is confined to NA, with APAC coming in a close second.</p>



<p>Do you follow the esports industry in any way? Are you of the opinion that it’s dying, or do you agree that it’s growing at a powerful pace? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

<p>Dr Disrespect, one of the most controversial content creators of all time, has revealed a move to Rumble, breaking away from YouTube in a bid to seek better monetisation. The disgraced streamer found himself at the centre of a dire ‘minor messaging’ scandal mere months ago, and it cost him his friends, sponsorships, and income on YouTube.</p>



<p>Now, the team at Rumble, a developing streaming platform, has revealed that Dr Disrespect will be coming on board. However, he’s not coming as a mere streamer – he’s going to help run the platform.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-interesting-choice">Interesting Choice</h2>



<p>In <a href="https://corp.rumble.com/blog/dr-disrespect-will-lead-rumble-gaming-join-rumble-premium/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a press release</a>, the Rumble team revealed that Dr Disrespect will broadcast his gameplay on the platform and provide exclusive content via the Rumble Premium ecosystem to his ‘Champions Club’.</p>



<p>It gets deeper, though.</p>



<p>The 42-year-old streamer, who admitted earlier this year to using Twitch to message a minor in 2017, will serve as an advisor and ‘help build the Rumble Gaming community’. His new role lands him in the position of ‘Head of Rumble Gaming’, with the team at the growing platform seeking to lean on Dr Disrespect’s veteran status in the industry to appeal more to gamers.</p>



<p>Historically, Guy ‘Dr Disrespect’ Beahm has worked at Sledgehammer Games as a community manager and map designer, and he served a pivotal role at Midnight Society before he was cut from the company following the allegations earlier this year.</p>



<p>It was confirmed that Dr Disrespect’s first stream on Rumble will take place on December 2, and the platform has gone so far as to provide a special promotion that users can lean on to secure discounted subscriptions during his first appearance on the site.</p>



<p>Are you looking forward to seeing Dr Disrespect on Rumble? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

The end of Xbox Avatar Editor support means that users will no long be able to access Xbox Avatars or any of their purchased avatar items. Xbox says it will refund all Avatar purchases made between November 1, 2023 and January 9, 2025.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Xbox is specifically ending support for the Avatars introduced as part of the Xbox Avatars Update back in 2018, which were touted as more detailed, expressive and creative than their predecessors on the Xbox 360. Xbox says it will retain support for the simpler Xbox Original Avatars, which will continue to work in supported Xbox 360 games and will be accessible via the Xbox Original Avatars app.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">One way or another, Avatars feel less and less important these days. In its FAQ, Xbox said that it was ending support due to "low engagement" and a "shift in focus toward delivering other player experiences," noting that players can still personalize their experience with dynamic backgrounds, profile colors, and other options. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">In the meantime, Xbox is looking ahead to the future, among other things working on a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-handheld-what-i-want-to-see-from-microsofts-portable-console">dedicated handheld</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/sony-new-playstation-handheld-ps5-umd<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Bloomberg is<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-11-25/sony-working-on-new-handheld-console-for-ps5-games-to-rival-nintendo-s-switch" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> reporting</a> that Sony, fresh off the failure of the PlayStation Portal and having had eight years to survey the success of the Nintendo Switch, is <em>maybe </em>planning on launching a more serious handheld device. One that, instead of letting you beam your PS5 games to a portable screen, would just let you play PS5 games on the handheld directly.</p><p>The report, which is pretty thin, says that the Portal itself was once planned to be a standalone gaming handheld, like its predecessors the PSP and Vita. The fact it wasn't is probably what has most doomed it, something Sony is maybe taking onboard with these plans for a new handheld, plans that Bloomberg couch by saying are years away, and may not ever come to fruition at all.</p><p>Maybe they will, maybe they won't! I for one want them to though, and not just because both of Sony's previous dedicated handhelds were great portable gaming devices. It's because a new device--which I'm going to call the PlayStation Portalble until I'm ordered to stop--might be arriving at a moment in history when I can ask for the return of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Universal_Media_Disc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Universal Media Disc</a> and have it not be a complete joke.</p><p>A device like this would be years away, for reasons like the fact the battery capacity for handheld PS5 games just isn't there yet; even the Steam Deck can only last a few hours, and its games can be fully scaled via their PC settings. A PS5 game just trying to <em>run </em>would be like going back in time to the Game Gear, chewing through entire packs of batteries by the minute. So there's time for this thing to arrive, for internal hardware to get smaller, for batteries to get more economical. Time for things to change, for trends to take shape.</p><p>If years away, it could be arriving at a time when the market, having long drifted towards the convenience of digital purchases--as evidenced by Sony's own PS5 re-release--would be having not just second thoughts about forever renting content, but third and fourth as well.<a href="https://theweek.com/culture-life/media/why-physical-media-is-having-a-moment" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Physical media is coming back</a>, baby, and there wouldn't be many companies better poised to capitalise on a desire for proprietary physical media than Sony, the company that brought us everything from Betamax to the Blu-Ray to the...UMD.</p><p>With internal space at a premium in a handheld gaming device, storage expensive and money to be made selling weird discs that you also happen to be the only one making, the UMD's return would be <em>triumphant</em>. Watching a full-sized PS5 disc get awkwardly sucked into a PS5 is an unfulfilling experience. Slamming a UMD that contains a miniaturised PS5 game into the back of a new Sony handheld would <em>rule</em>. Especially if, like the original UMD, a successor format didn't just contain games, but movies as well!</p><p>Will any of this actually happen? Probably not! The device itself might not even get made, and even if it did, there's a greater chance it would be digital-only, because we live in hell. But a man can still dream. Of simpler times, and discs that came in cartridges, and the chance for Sony to re-release <em>The Last Of Us</em> for the 17th time...</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
