It’s a lot of hard work, but it’s a lot less hard work than making a whole new game, and only one of them is certain to make lots of money. New games, and especially new IPs, now come with enormous risk, where hundreds of millions of dollars can evaporate in a single disastrous launch week. The teams creating <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/firewalk-studios-concord-ps5-sony-live-service-shutdown-1851684290&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/firewalk-studios-concord-ps5-sony-live-service-shutdown-1851684290"><em>Concord</em></a></span> and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/suicide-squad-hogwarts-legacy-rocksteady-arkham-1851522893&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/suicide-squad-hogwarts-legacy-rocksteady-arkham-1851522893"><em>Suicide Squad</em></a></span><em>&nbsp;</em>worked incredibly hard, exhaustingly so, and the results were massive financial black holes. If their time had instead been dedicated to making a proven success look prettier, profits would have been practically guaranteed. Remastering games is a pragmatic decision based on prudent economics. It’s just that it also sucks.</p><figure id="" data-id="a949ae412b5bab12f18946c2e2999074" data-recommend-id="image://a949ae412b5bab12f18946c2e2999074" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot of the opening post-sewer moment in Oblivion, with no mods." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A screenshot of the opening post-sewer moment in Oblivion, with no mods." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>This is the game running vanilla, no mods, and it clearly doesn’t need a remaster.</figcaption><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Bethesda / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="a949ae412b5bab12f18946c2e2999074" data-recommend-id="image://a949ae412b5bab12f18946c2e2999074" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot of the opening post-sewer moment in Oblivion, with no mods." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Here’s a secret fact about <em>The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion</em>: It works just fine. Great, in fact. Released in 2006, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/22330/The_Elder_Scrolls_IV_Oblivion_Game_of_the_Year_Edition/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/22330/The_Elder_Scrolls_IV_Oblivion_Game_of_the_Year_Edition/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">you can buy it from Steam right now for $15</a></span> (and frequently far, far less), and it works perfectly right away. It runs in 2560x1440, requires no hacks or mods, and within minutes of booting it up just now I wasn’t noticing that the graphics are dated. Heck, Bethesda games’ graphics are dated at launch, invariably improved by modders in the months that follow—no one was buying <em>Oblivion</em> for its looks in 2006, not least the hilariously terrible character models. And given <em>Starfield</em>’s are just as embarrassing, it’s not like that’s going to suddenly improve either.</p><p>The point is, <em>Oblivion</em> already exists in a very playable form that’s just as entertaining and flawed as it was 20 years ago. Also, there are 20 years’ worth of mods to improve all the aspects that Bethesda is pathologically incapable of doing well—UI, facial animations, inventory arrangement, voice acting, textures—to have the game look and run exactly as you want. So what, precisely, is an officially remastered <em>Oblivion </em>for?</p><p>Yes, like I said, it’s for making money, especially from long-term fans of the game who <em>do </em>want to see it look prettier, returning to a Cyrodiil  whose graphics look like their two-decade-old invented memories of the original. There’s also the potential to draw in a new audience who’s perhaps only ever played <em>Skyrim</em>, so they can be disappointed to learn the predecessor wasn’t nearly as good. But even <em>Skyrim</em>’s original audience is noticing a little more grey in their hair, given that was nearly 14 years ago.</p><p>This is then made more frustrating given the extraordinary efforts of the <em>Skyblivion</em> modders, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/skyblivion-skyrim-oblivion-bethesda-mod-remake-1851731043&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/skyblivion-skyrim-oblivion-bethesda-mod-remake-1851731043">who have spent over a decade remaking <em>Oblivion</em> in <em>Skyrim</em>’s engine</a></span>, hoping to finally finish their herculean project in 2025.

Yet it’s worth noting that <em>Skyblivion</em> has a far more distinct aesthetic than the wishy-washy meh-ness of what we’ve seen of Bethesda’s version in the leaks.</p><figure id="" data-id="43f66ee4d5c8b6a2337a6dacacf93d4b" data-recommend-id="image://43f66ee4d5c8b6a2337a6dacacf93d4b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A Marathon (2025) character holding a gun." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A Marathon (2025) character holding a gun." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Bungie / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="43f66ee4d5c8b6a2337a6dacacf93d4b" data-recommend-id="image://43f66ee4d5c8b6a2337a6dacacf93d4b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A Marathon (2025) character holding a gun." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Releasing remasters is now incredibly commonplace, for all the reasons given above, but there’s also a sad irony to this focus on remastering big-name titles from the past few decades. While <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/gog-games-preservation-program-drm-1851696363&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/gog-games-preservation-program-drm-1851696363">GOG has recently launched some significant efforts to preserve PC gaming</a></span>, it’s barely scratching the surface of a vast history of video games that are being lost to time and technology, because those who own the rights either don’t care or are actively hostile to anyone attempting to preserve their games for them. Games that cannot just be bought from Steam and run with a click are certainly not receiving elaborate remakes, and can now only be played via illegal methods.</p><p>Now, I’m not daft, and I’m not advocating for publishers to spend millions of dollars remastering forgotten, obscure games from their 1980s and ‘90s catalogues; I know they’re far more likely to plunder them for titles to attach to wildly different new games (cough-<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/marathon-gameplay-trailer-release-date-price-season-ps5-1851775940&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/marathon-gameplay-trailer-release-date-price-season-ps5-1851775940"><em>Marathon</em></a></span>-cough). Still, I do really believe that dedicating a fraction of the resources that go into remasters to preserving a company’s back-catalogue would be beneficial to humanity. Or, you know, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/editorial-why-games-should-enter-the-public-domain&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/editorial-why-games-should-enter-the-public-domain" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>just releasing them into the public domain like they obviously should</em></a></span>. </p><p>However, I think this should also be recognized as part of the existential malaise in which video games now find themselves, where the AA game is all but non-existent and new ideas are kryptonite to publishers.</p><figure id="" data-id="d0cd306078ad17fa76c9f2f1c0d8ad70" data-recommend-id="image://d0cd306078ad17fa76c9f2f1c0d8ad70" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A man holding up a massive boulder in the desert." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><span data-id="d0cd306078ad17fa76c9f2f1c0d8ad70" data-recommend-id="image://d0cd306078ad17fa76c9f2f1c0d8ad70" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A man holding up a massive boulder in the desert." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Yes, the ballooning costs of game development would be the subject of a whole other article, and the industry’s obsessive focus on live-service is yet another, but these and other crippling aspects of game creation under late-stage capitalism all contribute toward the reasons why remastering has become so endemic. As I’ve said, it’s safe. And right now, publishers are retreating toward perceived safety like terrified kittens. But doing this can only make the problems worse—they can only solidify the notion that the only sure way to make a profitable game is to have it be one you’ve made already.</p><p>What we need are bold new ideas made at sensible prices. And it’s agonizing to watch the indie world produce original hit after original hit, and publishers unable to recognize how they could be funding and profiting from this phenomenon at a AA level. The reason there are so many great games to plunder and remaster is because for decades previously, this is how game development worked! There was no need for a game to make half a billion dollars for it to have been worth releasing, when doing so gave the developers the opportunity to create fresh conceits that could gain widening popularity that fueled ever-more sequels and spin-offs.</p><p>Because while it’s grimly amusing to joke about Naughty Dog remaking the same three games for the rest of eternity, the company also demonstrates that it’s a Sisyphean task. Endlessly updating a game to reflect the latest gimmicks in graphics is folly, that boulder always rolling back down as fast as it can be pushed up, withe the miserable irony that it’s just as good of a boulder when left at the bottom of the hill.</p><p>Bethesda, for crying out loud, get on with making <em>The</em>&nbsp;<em>Elder Scrolls VI</em> and leave the perfectly good and perfectly enjoyable <em>Oblivion </em>and <em>Fallout 3</em> to the modders. And, for goodness sakes, release <em>Morrowind</em>’s source code. And the same goes for everyone else.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>It's been quite the year for Destiny players, and the game's evolution continues with the latest chapter, dubbed The Edge of Fate, getting revealed soon. No details were given outside of the reveal being a special livestream event on May 6, starting at 9AM PT/12PM ET.</p><p>"Developers will discuss the first expansion, The Edge of Fate, and much more during the event," Bungie <a href="https://press.bungie.com/Bungie-Announces-Reveal-Event-for-Destiny-2-The-Edge-of-Fate" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">said in a statement</a>. With the events of The Final Shape having major repercussions for your Guardian, as well as the Vanguard, it feels like all bets are off when it comes to the story.</p><p>How the story is structured is something else. Following the launch of The Final Shape last year, Bungie announced changes to how it planned to deliver content, switching from <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bungie-is-changing-destiny-2-approach-to-content-as-it-begins-a-new-multi-year-saga/1100-6526354/" data-ref-id="1100-6526354">Seasons to Episodes</a>, while also announcing <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-destiny-2-concept-art-sheds-just-a-little-light-on-upcoming-expansion/1100-6526840/" data-ref-id="1100-6526840">the future of Destiny 2 as Codename: Frontiers</a>.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15976769/4477664-4364001-d2_frontiers_roadmap.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4477664" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1024" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15976769/4477664-4364001-d2_frontiers_roadmap.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4477664"></a><figcaption>The Destiny 2 roadmap for 2025.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15976769/4477664-4364001-d2_frontiers_roadmap.jpg"></figure><p>Starting with Destiny: Edge of Fate, the game will get two expansions, with four "major updates" per year. Fans have been eager to know specifics regarding what's next for Destiny 2 as the episodic content has now come to a close, and any sort of schedule has remained a mystery.</p><p>This latest expansion for Destiny 2 is expected to be what was given the codename "Apollo". Per the roadmap Bungie released back in September, Apollo was scheduled to release sometime in Summer 2025. Apollo is planned to be a paid expansion with new stories, locations, missions, and more. However, it won’t be the only update coming to the game. Bungie is also planning another full expansion called Behemoth for Winter 2025, which will also have the two major updates leading into spring of next year.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/mario-kart-world-direct-airs-tomorrow-15-minute-in-depth-look/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Nintendo will live stream its Mario Kart World Direct tomorrow morning, <strong>April 17, 2025</strong>, at <strong>6 a.m. PT / 9 a.m. ET / 2 p.m. BT</strong>.</p>
<p>The direct was announced when Nintendo first showcased Mario Kart World during the <a href="https://wccftech.com/mario-kart-world-revealed-launching-exclusively-on-nintendo-switch-2/">Nintendo Switch 2 Direct</a> at the beginning of the month as the next chance we'd get to learn more about it. With the live stream placeholder now up on Nintendo's YouTube channel, we know that it will only be a 15-minute presentation in which Nintendo says we'll get an "<em>in-depth</em>" look at the new kart racer.</p>
<p><iframe title="Mario Kart World Direct 4.17.2025" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mq4uCJDwO9U?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>It'll be interesting to see what Nintendo shows in this direct, but, of course, we've seen a lot about Mario Kart World since the Nintendo Switch 2 Direct earlier this month. A big part of the conversation has been around the fact that Mario Kart World is one of the few Nintendo Switch 2 games that will cost $80.</p>
<p>According to Nintendo of America president Doug Bowser, <a href="https://wccftech.com/mario-kart-world-is-worth-the-80-price-of-admission-says-nintendo/">Mario Kart World is worth the increased price.</a> Bowser even highlighted tomorrow's direct, telling players with doubts to tune in and see what Nintendo shows off.</p>
<p>"<em>But honestly, this is a game that is so big and so vast that you will find so many little things to</em> <em>discover</em>." Bowser told <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=31026X886738&amp;isjs=1&amp;jv=15.7.1&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwccftech.com%2Fmario-kart-world-is-worth-the-80-price-of-admission-says-nintendo%2F&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ign.com%2Farticles%2Fswitch-2-exclusive-mario-kart-world-justifies-its-80-price-tag-nintendo-insists-in-first-comments-addressing-cost-controversy&amp;xs=1&amp;xtz=240&amp;xuuid=a8794423f20c06ce869d8877c3daa0d3&amp;xjsf=other_click__auxclick%20%5B2%5D">IGN</a>. "<em>And there's still some other secrets remaining that I think as people end up buying and playing the game, they're going to find this to be probably the richest Mario Kart experience they've ever had.</em>"</p>
<p>Wccftech's own Nathan Birch had the chance to play Mario Kart World during a recent Nintendo event, and while he admits to having fun with the game, it also didn't blow him away. That said, there's still a lot of potential that can't be seen in a short 20-minute demo. We'll see how much tomorrow's 15-minute direct adds to that.</p>
<p>"<em>Mario Kart World feels very much like a shiny new Mario Kart 8 model, which will be great for those looking for more of what that game offered, but there’s no denying the game feels a bit familiar at times."</em> <a href="https://wccftech.com/mario-kart-world-hands-on-impressions/">Birch wrote</a>.</p>
<p>"<em>That said, Mario Kart World’s interconnected map is a compelling creation, and while I need to play more, I can imagine a lot of potential ways Nintendo could utilize, and possibly expand, their new racing world. Nintendo may be about to unleash the racing platform they support for the next decade and I’m intrigued to see where this road may lead us.</em>"</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-hardcore-mode-update</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-hardcore-mode-released-for-true-masochists.1165722/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-hardcore-mode-update<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Warhorse Studios has released a new update for&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2</em>, and if you've been waiting for the immersive medieval RPG to up its difficulty a few (hundred) notches, this one's for you.</p>

<p>Patch 1.2.4's biggest addition is Hardcore Mode, which was promised as part of the game's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-roadmap" rel="nofollow">post-launch roadmap back in January</a>. As the name suggests, this isn't one for the faint of heart, so be sure you know what you're in for before you fire it up.</p>

<p>Hardcore Mode removes a number of gameplay elements to which you may have become accustomed, like your character's position appearing on the map, compass directions, and the ability to fast travel. It really is that brutal.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-hardcore-mode-soldiers.jpg?itok=0Z753m3V 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-hardcore-mode-soldiers.jpg?itok=jTLEuIaJ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>"Fast travel? Sorry, friend. We don't know what that is."</figcaption></figure><p>As if that wasn't enough, you'll also have to choose at least three negative perks that will weigh you down for the rest of your playthrough. These include "Sweaty", which "increases your personal pungency", and "Numbskull", which slows your XP gain. Yikes.</p>

<p>You can read a little more about Hardcore Mode <a href="https://kingdomcomerpg.com/en/news/hardcore-mode" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">here</a>, but suffice it to say this definitely isn't one for you if you prefer a more leisurely stroll through Bohemia. You'll have to get, well, sweaty if you want to succeed.</p>

<p>If you're not interested in Hardcore Mode, don't worry; there's still plenty for you to enjoy as part of this update. Other changes include rebalanced herb prices in shops, as well as a new bald hairstyle (or lack of, I suppose) for Henry.</p>

<p>The full patch notes for&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2&nbsp;</em>Patch 1.2.4 are available <a href="https://kingdomcomerpg.com/en/news/patch-notes-1-2-4" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">via Warhorse's official website</a> if you want to know everything that's new. It's not a long list, so don't worry!</p>




<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2</em>, it's an open-world RPG set in 15th-century Bohemia, and like <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/kingdom-come-deliverance" rel="nofollow">its predecessor</a>, it places an emphasis on realism over fantasy elements like magic or monsters.</p>

<p>The game was a hit for Warhorse and parent company Embracer Group, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-sales-2m-two-weeks" rel="nofollow">racking up two million sales</a> within its first two weeks.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/new-frostpunk-game-2027-11-bit-studios<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Frostpunk&nbsp;</em>developer 11 bit studios has announced that a new game in the series is on the way, although you're going to have to wait a fair while for it, unfortunately.</p>

<p>The new&nbsp;<em>Frostpunk&nbsp;</em>game was revealed as part of 11 bit's <a href="https://ir.11bitstudios.com/en/news/11-bit-studios-boldly-invests-in-new-titles/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">financial statement</a> for the 2024-25 fiscal year, in which CEO&nbsp;Przemysław Marszał says "production on the next project set in the <em>Frostpunk</em> universe" has begun. The company is currently aiming to launch the game in 2027.</p>

<p>11 bit CEO&nbsp;Przemysław Marszał says the decision is part of his studio's response to a shifting market, with 11 bit looking to "diversify both the scale of projects and the time [it devotes] to each of them".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/11-bit-studios-new-frostpunk-game-frostpunk-2.jpg?itok=vmuZrUji 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/11-bit-studios-new-frostpunk-game-frostpunk-2.jpg?itok=2NTHoh5i 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>11 bit studios has revealed that a new&nbsp;<em>Frostpunk&nbsp;</em>game is set for 2027.</figcaption></figure><p>Of course, Marszał stopped short of explaining exactly what the new&nbsp;<em>Frostpunk&nbsp;</em>game is, so we don't yet know whether he's referring to a potential&nbsp;<em>Frostpunk 3&nbsp;</em>or simply to a new spinoff game set in the same world as the city-builders.</p>

<p>We do, however, know that 11 bit is also working on "a slightly larger title", which the company expects to launch in 2029. It's also not clear whether that will be a <em>Frostpunk&nbsp;</em>game as well, but we're still a good few years away from that one, so don't expect to hear any more about it for a while.</p>

<p>The news comes as 11 bit reports an operating loss of around $750,000 for 2024, despite a 168.9% sales increase marking "the highest sales in the Company’s history".</p>

After <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NTXoUsdSAnA">widespread reports</a> of black screens, game crashes, and general stability issues, today’s 576.02 driver release (<a href="https://us.download.nvidia.com/Windows/576.02/576.02-desktop-win10-win11-64bit-international-dch-whql.exe">.exe download</a>) not only bumps the version number significantly from last month’s 572.83, it also includes a number of significant fixes.</p><p>The <a href="https://us.download.nvidia.com/Windows/576.02/576.02-win11-win10-release-notes.pdf">release notes</a> for Nvidia’s 576.02 driver mention that it fixes stability issues with Windows 11 version 24H2, a BSOD when playing DLSS 4 games with Multi Frame Generation, random black screen issues with the RTX 50-series GPUs, and general system stability issues. Nvidia has also addressed “game stability issues when playing games with DLSS Frame Generation + GSYNC.”</p><p>This driver release also fixes random crashes in <em>Fortnite</em>, a <em>Star Wars Outlaws</em> hang after the game is idle, a <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em> crash, and stutter when using VSYNC in <em>Overwatch 2</em>. There are also a variety of fixes for <em>Hellblade 2</em>, <em>Control</em>, <em>The Last of Us Part 1</em>, and <em>Uncharted: Legacy of Thieves Collection</em>.</p><p>It’s an unusual amount of bug fixes for Nvidia’s usual driver updates, which regularly contain only a handful of fixed gaming or general bugs that fill half a page of Nvidia’s release notes. These latest bug fixes take up almost two pages this time around.</p><p>Hopefully this large list addresses most of the complaints we’ve seen ever since the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/23/24349619/nvidia-rtx-5090-review-test-benchmark">RTX 5090 release in January</a>. While Nvidia has struggled with RTX 50-series driver stability, the issues have also been impacting existing GPUs after the introduction of DLSS 4.</p><div><p>Nvidia’s 576.02 driver also supports the GeForce <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/648705/nvidias-rtx-5060-ti-gpu-pricing-release-date">RTX 5060 Ti GPU that’s launching today</a>, starting at $379.</p></div></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Ubisoft has released a new update for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/assassins-creed-shadows/" data-ref-id="5000-571922">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a>, and according to the patch notes, this one is designed to address several more issues in the game. Title update 1.0.3 will go live today, and while it's not nearly as massive as the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-patch-adds-quality-of-life-updates-and-ps5-pro-upgrades-this-week/1100-6530661/">previous patch</a>, you can expect bug fixes and PS5 Pro improvements. Curiously, the patch will also temporarily deactivate the auto-sell feature in the game, as Ubisoft says that it has to work out some unexpected issues introduced by that function.</p><p>For PS5 Pro players, a graphical issue caused by activating the HDR and PSSR options will be fixed, and PS5 owners in general can expect several other crash-related bugs to be solved. For download sizes, the patch is quite small on PS5 and PC via Steam, while Xbox Series X|S, PC, and Mac users can expect a longer download session. You can see the full patch notes below.</p><p>In related news, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-is-now-2025s-second-biggest-game-so-far-in-the-us/1100-6530868/">Assassin's Creed Shadows is currently the second-best-selling game in the US</a> for 2025, trailing behind Capcom's Monster Hunter Wilds, which is still the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/2025-best-selling-games/2900-6281/">best-selling game of 2025</a> so far.

                <p>Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer has further discussed Xbox Game Pass, saying the subscription service is "not for everybody," and that if every Game Pass subscriber canceled their membership and decided to buy games outright instead, that would be good for Microsoft as well.</p><p>So who is Game Pass for? Spencer told <a href="https://variety.com/2025/gaming/news/microsoft-phil-spencer-minecraft-movie-fallout-season-2-1236352653/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Variety</a> it can be a "healthy option for certain people," but he acknowledged that Microsoft isn't trying to get everyone to sign up.</p><p>"It's not for everybody. If you play one or two games a year, Game Pass probably isn't the right business model for you; you should just buy those two games, and that would make total sense," he said. "But I want you to have the choice. So we remain focused on everything that's on Game Pass is also available to buy."</p><p>Many have wondered about the economic realities of Game Pass, and while Spencer didn't get into that, he said the number of total hours people are playing on Xbox "continues to grow fairly substantially," in part due to Game Pass. "Game Pass has been an important part of that, but I don't try to solve for Game Pass specifically on its own. It's kind of part of the equation for Xbox finding new players," he said.</p><p>As Spencer has said time and again over the years, Game Pass is only one option in the overall Xbox ecosystem for how people can play games on Xbox. He's not trying to get everyone to sign up, but instead wants to position Game Pass as one possible way to consume Xbox games.</p><p>"I've always thought about Game Pass as just another option for somebody who wants to play. We have many business models for people playing from free-to-play, buying games, discounted games--Game Pass is an option," he explained. "So when I'm looking at Game Pass, I want to make sure the hours that people are playing continue to go up, that new people see this as a way for them to find and build their library of games, and we remain focused on that," he said.</p><p>Also in the interview, Spencer said the video game console business is "good," but it's an "established" market sector that is "not really a growing segment in gaming," at least not for Microsoft. As such, Spencer said that's why you're seeing Microsoft invest in and support PC and cloud as much as it is.</p><p>"There isn't a unique need for Game Pass to be the only way for people to play. If everybody who's a Game Pass subscriber instead decided to buy their games, that's good for the business as well."</p><p>While console sales may not be growing for Xbox, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ps5-sales-outpacing-ps4-while-xbox-series-x-s-falls-behind-xbox-one-in-us/1100-6524789/" data-ref-id="1100-6524789">they are for its rival PlayStation</a>. The industry also saw enormous console growth with Nintendo's Switch console, which has sold more than 150 million units to rank as Nintendo's best-selling home platform ever.</p><p>In related news, the Game Pass library was restocked this week with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-5-and-enhanced-version-out-now-on-game-pass/1100-6530881/" data-ref-id="1100-6530881">GTA 5 for Xbox Series X|S and GTA 5 Enhanced for PC</a>.

And looking ahead, Spencer said, "I want to support Switch 2."</p><p>"Nintendo has been a great partner. We think it is a unique way for us to reach players who aren't PC players, who aren't players on Xbox. It lets us continue to grow our community of people that care about the franchises that we have, and that's really important for us to make sure we continue to invest in our games," he said.</p><p>Spencer added: "I'm really a big believer in what Nintendo means for this industry and us continuing to support them.

			<p>The stunning NVIDIA Unreal Engine 5 Zorah tech demo shown last month is now available for download, giving users the chance to experience neural rendering, which NVIDIA itself described as the future of graphics.</p>
<p>The new demo, which can be downloaded <a href="https://dlss.download.nvidia.com/demos/zorah/ZorahSample_UE5_Source_1.0.0.7z" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>, is powered by the NVIDIA RTX Unreal Engine 5 branch and features plenty of cutting-edge tech, so performance is likely to be unstable on the vast majority of system configurations. Still, it provides an early look at how next-generation games will look with enhanced real-time path tracing and every other improvement offered by Neural Rendering.</p>
<p><iframe title="Zorah | Neural Rendering, Powered by GeForce RTX 50 Series and AI" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZtTtUyqGs-o?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>NVIDIA RTX Neural Rendering support in DirectX was announced last month during<a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-announces-rtx-neural-shading-support-going-live-in-aprils-directx12-preview/"> GDC 2025</a>, when NVIDIA also provided an overview of how Neural Rendering can be used, such as RTX Neural Texture Compression, which can create a neural representation of thousands of textures in a very short time, saving up to seven times the VRAM and RAM compared to regular compression tech, and RTX Neural Radiance Cache, which can infer theoretically infinite multi-bounce indirect lighting from just one or two bounces to optimize performance and visuals.</p>
<p>More information on the RTX Neural Rendering features found in the Unreal Engine 5 Zorah tech demo can be found on <a href="https://developer.nvidia.com/blog/get-started-with-neural-rendering-using-nvidia-rtx-kit/">NVIDIA's official website.</a></p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Skull and Bones: Year 2 Update Announcements Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>The teaser shown off as part of the Skull and Bones Year 2 Showcase shows early gameplay with pirates dual-wielding blades and firearms. It looks like players will have the option of getting up close and personal or picking enemies off from a distance, depending on their choice of weapon.</p><p>The new combat style is set to be integrated in Year 2's third season as part of a larger content update adding officers to player ships. In order to recruit said officers, players will have to undertake the land-based missions to rescue officers being held in captivity by the Rogue Warlord.</p><p>From what was shown off in the showcase, the land combat appears to be purely PvE, and takes place entirely on land--meaning boarding enemy ships and on-deck combat is unlikely to arrive with this combat update, despite also being highly requested by players.</p><p>Skull and Bones Year 2 Season 1 has already kicked off, bringing with it item ascension, world tiers, new developments in the world's story, and more new features. Players will have to wait until later in the year for the debut of land combat in Season 3.</p>

                <p> The next Battlefield game doesn't even have an official name yet, but fans are already hands-on with an early build thanks to the new <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-to-play-the-new-battlefield-early-sign-up-for-a-chance-to-get-into-test-program/1100-6529190/" data-ref-id="1100-6529190">Battlefield Labs playtest program</a>. That program has proved a headache for devs, with participants leaking footage in spite of NDAs, and starting rumors about the use of skill-based matchmaking (SBMM).</p><p>A rumor that Battlefield 6 would use SBMM, which likely originated from the playtest, has spread through the Battlefield community, with fans up in arms about its potential inclusion. Battlefield's lead producer David Sirland attempted to clarify the use of SBMM with playtesters, in a post that was later <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1jwo1s3/psa_from_david_sirland_in_bf_labs_surrounding_the/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">shared to Reddit</a>. </p><p>"Just for clarity--saying SBMM is bad is not really useful. What you really want to say is 'Heavy SBMM where skill separation is a priority is bad,'" Sirland said in the post. "But that doesn't make skill as a factor in matchmaking bad wholesale, on the contrary we need a skill value to make balanced teams--no matter the ranges of skills total on a server. It wouldn't be fun if all high skill players ended up on the same team, would it?"</p><p>Sirland added that Battlefield 2042 also would be considered to have SBMM by this definition, and attempted to calm down the conversation by assuring fans that any SBMM used in Battlefield 6 would be applied with a light touch. The response to Sirland's comments being shared to Reddit only reignited the discussion, prompting Battlefield's global community manager T0TALfps to step in. </p><p>"Okay enough," T0TALfps's comment started, trying to put an end to the ongoing discourse. The community manager reminded players that the build that part of the BF Labs playtest is far from a finished game, and there is no guarantee that any feature in it will make it to the finish line in the same form. T0TALfps continued to tell off leakers who ignored NDAs to spread details about the early playtests.</p><p>"There is a specific time and place for the wider community to learn about new features and functionalities, and this is not it," they said. "We will address various topics and expand participation in Battlefield Labs when appropriate, but the constant reposting of things is not that time or place. Individuals are and will continue to be removed if they continue to violate the NDA that they agreed to."</p><p>It will likely be a while until we get more official details on the next Battlefield game--including its official title. According to a recent EA financial report, the company expects the game to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-battlefield-game-releasing-by-march-2026/1100-6529243/" data-ref-id="1100-6529243">release before March 2026</a>. Interested players can still sign up for the <a href="http://go.ea.com/bflabs" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Battlefield Labs playtest</a> program in the meantime.</p>
