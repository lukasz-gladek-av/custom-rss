		<p>SpaceCraft will not be entering early access this year, Shiro Games has announced, pushing back the release to Q2 2026. However, Shiro Games has announced that there will be a playtest for SpaceCraft taking place and it will be starting at the end of October. However, there are some restrictions such as there only being EU servers, limited space, English translation only, and it will not represent the early access version of the game. However, the playtest will be continuous and new content will be added. The roadmap for SpaceCraft’s playtest can be seen below.</p>



<p>Shiro Games has confirmed it has been able to implement a much requested feature for SpaceCraft, and that feature is cockpit view when piloting ships. The studio did issue an apology for delaying SpaceCraft’s early access saying,<em>“In order to fit the playtest in our development schedule, the Early Access release window has been moved to Q2 2026. We understand this news might be disappointing to some of you, and for that we would like to apologise. The playtest is a crucial part in our process of developing a high quality experience and we could not prepare for a successful Early Access launch without incorporating player feedback beforehand.”</em></p>
<p>In SpaceCraft, players will have the option to forge their own path in the galaxy, but that does not seem to be the way for long term success. Shiro Games has stated that connections between players is the real key, building up organisations and factions called Corpos, to dominate the emerging economy and becoming new military powers too. Players will be able to build orbital and land based bases that will grow as more housing and resource centres are added. Searching and securing resources will be necessary to keep things running and growing.</p>

<p>Summer Game Fest will return for another show in 2026, and its official date and new venue have been confirmed.</p>



<p>In a post on social media on Tuesday, organizer Geoff Keighley announced that the annual summer gaming showcase will take place on Friday, June 5, 2026. This year, however, the show will be taking place at the Dolby Theatre in Hollywood, California.</p>



<p><a href="https://x.com/geoffkeighley/status/1978128676639350803" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Keighley says</a> that the show will be a “spectacular, cross-platform showcase of what’s next in video games.” The show also promises, as expected, brand new video game announcements and reveals.</p>



<p>Summer Game Fest 2025 took place on June 6, 2025, at the YouTube Theater in Inglewood, California. The show had spent the last three years at the venue since it began producing in-person events. This year’s show featured reveals such as <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/lego-voyagers-review-a-journey-worth-every-second/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Lego Voyagers</a>, Deadpool VR, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dying-light-the-beast-review/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dying Light: The Beast</a>, and Resident Evil: Requiem, among others. </p>

              <p><span>A year after </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-hack-teraleak-gen-10-switch-2-game-freak-beta-1851671688"><span>the first one</span></a><span>, a </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-leak-generation-10-wind-wave-galar-legends-mmo-2000635337"><span>new leak of documents and production concepts</span></a><span> has hit Game Freak and the contents are spreading across social media. The </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>developer has several upcoming games in the works, including a Generation X game, a </span><i><span>Legends </span></i><span>game set in Galar, and an MMO-style game that lets players explore multiple regions. But the leak isn’t just about the games that are on the way. We also learned a few interesting tidbits about older games and the inner workings of the company. While they may not be as exciting as “Generation X games will feature procedurally generated worlds,” here are a few takeaways.&nbsp;</span></p> <h2><b><i>Scarlet</i></b><b> and </b><b><i>Violet</i></b><b>‘s DLC cost as much to make as a full game</b></h2> <p><span>I was pretty lukewarm on both of </span><i><span>Scarlet</span></i><span> and </span><i><span>Violet</span></i><span>‘s DLC expansions, but the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-scarlet-violet-indigo-disk-dlc-review-terapagos-1851100679"><i><span>Indigo Disk</span></i></a><span> and </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-scarlet-violet-teal-mask-dlc-review-ogerpon-1850839564"><i><span>Teal Mask</span></i></a><span> were such big projects that they ended up </span><a href="https://x.com/CentroLeaks/status/1978000011733664139"><span>costing as much as </span><i><span>Pokémon Legends: Arceus</span></i><span>‘ entire budget</span></a><span>. According </span><a href="https://x.com/CentroLeaks/status/1977994754085253581"><span>to the leaks</span></a><span>, the add-ons sold around 6.15 million copies in the first 10 months, compared to the base </span><i><span>Scarlet </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Violet</span></i><span>’s 27 million in sales. </span><i><span>Arceus, </span></i><span>meanwhile, moved roughly twice what the DLC did (14 million copies) at a higher price point, so Game Freak is looking to scale back budgets for its DLC packs to make the business model more sustainable.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Development Budgets:</p> <p>– SV DLC: 500 million yen<br>– Legends 2/ZA: 2 billion yen<br>– Winds/Waves: 3 billion yen</p> <p>— Centro LEAKS (@CentroLeaks) <a href="https://twitter.com/CentroLeaks/status/1977779651352133635?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 13, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span>Another interesting fact about </span><i><span>Scarlet </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Violet</span></i><span>’s DLC is that while the final product ended up taking place in Kitkami and the Blueberry Academy in Unova (</span><i><span>Black </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>White</span></i><span>), the original plan was to set them in Kalos (</span><i><span>X</span></i><span> and </span><i><span>Y</span></i><span>/</span><i><span>Legends: Z-A</span></i><span>) and Alola (</span><i><span>Sun</span></i><span> and </span><i><span>Moon</span></i><span>).</span></p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">The Pokémon Scarlet/Violet DLC was originally planed to be set in Kalos and Alola.</p> <p>We ended up getting Kitakami and Unova. <a href="https://t.co/V0gWImY9kB">pic.twitter.com/V0gWImY9kB</a></p> <p>— Centro LEAKS (@CentroLeaks) <a href="https://twitter.com/CentroLeaks/status/1977779013339730404?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 13, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <h2><b>One of the original 151 nearly got a Gigantamax form</b></h2> <p><span>A big part of this leak was a swath of concept art for </span><i><span>Pokémon Sword </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Shield</span></i><span>. The 2019 Switch games introduced a new battle gimmick called Dynamaxing that allows players to temporarily transform their monsters into powerful kaijus under certain conditions. Every Pokémon could use this technique, but a select few were able to take on new forms entirely, called Gigantamax forms, once they grew to the size of a skyscraper. One of the original 151 Pokémon, the poison-type monster Nidoking, was at some point in development going to have one of these forms. He would have sported a red crown and beard, as well as a cape on his back. It would have really leaned into the “king” part of the Pokémon’s name, but it was scrapped. It’s unknown if its female counterpart, Nidoqueen, would have also received a similar form.</span></p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="zxx" dir="ltr"><a href="https://t.co/ygaYebF8Qw">pic.twitter.com/ygaYebF8Qw</a></p> <p>— (Not) Centro Leaks (@CentroLeaks_alt) <a href="https://twitter.com/CentroLeaks_alt/status/1977816325335720063?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 13, 2025</a></p></blockquote>   <h2><b>Team Star had a much different look</b></h2> <p><span>Team Star, the antagonistic team in </span><i><span>Scarlet </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Violet</span></i><span>, is a group of student outcasts who decided to turn all their anger on their fellow classmates. But it looks like the group was pretty different in the early concept stages. Leaked concept art shows several adult leaders in Team Star, rather than the school-aged crew we ended up facing in 2022. Some design motifs survived the iteration process, such as each member having a float/vehicle they pilot that caters to their different aesthetics, but overall, it seems like Team Star would have had a much different role if this version of the group had survived. One member has a biker/monster truck theme, another has a Wailmer-run boat, and there’s also a cunty-ass car being held up by several Togekiss. It looks like this would have been piloted by a dapper male character, and I wish I could have met this queen.</span></p>

Well, that doesn’t seem to be the case. At least, not yet. The documents in the leak make note of what the team wants for a future remake, but it’s not currently listed on any of Game Freak’s pipelines. Another developer could take on the project like ILCA did for </span><i><span>BDSP</span></i><span>, but for right now, I think we can safely assume that an eventual </span><i><span>Black </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>White </span></i><span>remake is a ways down the line.</span></p>

 <h2><b>Game Freak nearly made a Pokéwalker mobile app</b></h2> <p><span>Game Freak had plans to create a PokéWalker app that would be compatible with </span><i><span>Sword</span></i><span> and </span><i><span>Shield</span></i><span>. This would have allowed you to take your Pokémon with you on your phone, play minigames, and even catch new monsters to send to your copy of </span><i><span>Sword</span></i><span> or </span><i><span>Shield</span></i><span>. The name “Pokéwalker” initially referred to a peripheral that was first introduced back in </span><i><span>HeartGold </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>SoulSilver</span></i><span> as a pedometer you could clip onto your clothes or bag, and was essentially a virtual pet compatible with the DS games. It sounds like this would have served a lot of the same function, but without the manufacturing costs.</span></p>

The idea was to have two games, </span><i><span>Legends: Ho-Oh</span></i><span> and </span><i><span>Legends: Lugia</span></i><span>, rather than just the lone game like </span><i><span>Arceus </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Z-A </span></i><span>have been. Like </span><i><span>Arceus</span></i><span>, these games would have been a period piece with a protagonist shot through time into historical Johto and seeing the beginnings of Pokémon trainers.

According to translations of Game Freak personnel documents, employees considered the period up to </span><i><span>Black </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>White </span></i><span>to be largely dominated by Masuda and felt no one in the company could oppose him, leading to a “concentration of power” and disorganization within the studio. This eventually led to an argument between Masuda and character artist Ken Sugimori during the</span><i><span> X</span></i><span> and </span><i><span>Y</span></i><span> era, ultimately resulting in the company’s decision to remove Masuda from the director’s chair.

              <p>Of the many updates <i>No Man’s Sky</i> has received over the years, few have <a href="https://kotaku.com/no-mans-sky-voyagers-corvette-steam-players-2000622428">transformed the game</a> in the same way as the <a href="https://kotaku.com/no-mans-sky-voyagers-6-0-star-trek-mass-effect-2000620674">recently released Voyagers update</a>. Arriving toward the end of last summer, the update allows players to construct ships on a scale never seen before in the game, complete with fully traversable interiors. It led to some <a href="https://kotaku.com/no-mans-sky-corvette-ship-build-voyagers-update-star-wars-2000630689">wild original builds and recreations</a> of ships from legendary sci-fi franchises. Now, as spotted on Reddit recently, one player is looking to top them all with an <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/NoMansSkyTheGame/comments/1o683xa/someone_built_a_deathstar/">intimidating Death Star</a>.</p>   <p>Reddit user Even-Ad648 caught sight of the ominous orb of planet-destroying death in a <i>NMS</i> multiplayer game. And though it technically looks a bit smaller than the “real” thing would be, it’s nonetheless an impressive and grim-looking spectacle.</p>

 <p>Though you can create some impressive flying machines with <i>NMS</i>’ corvettes, this Death Star clearly uses some glitching to scale to the size of an in-world space station. And, according to Even-Ad648, the game crashed once they got too close. So I guess that rules out any death-defying close runs to exploit a structural vulnerability.</p> <p>Folks have made attempts to build Death Stars before. Some have struggled a bit to perfectly match the <a href="https://x.com/tuyosi723_pilot/status/1977671635256971341">spherical dimensions of the original</a>, but <a href="https://x.com/NoMansZine/status/1976211868017676486">others have made some decent efforts</a>. Still, there’s something eerie about that one in the Reddit vid. Fly safe out there, ya’ll.</p>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/world-of-warcraft/">World of Warcraft's</a> next expansion, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/in-world-of-warcraft-midnight-whats-old-is-new-again/1100-6534043/">Midnight</a>, is taking the nuclear option when it comes to eliminating combat add-ons, after years of Blizzard discussing how they posed problems for the health of the game. It's a bold approach, but, unfortunately, one that has been communicated incredibly poorly and seems to be taking unnecessary risks that could potentially make the game worse, not better, in the short term.</p><p dir="ltr">Until the recent arrival of Midnight's alpha build, it wasn't exactly clear how far-reaching Blizzard's approach would be. While non-combat add-ons (WoW's version of player-made mods) aren't being touched, it was known some major changes would be coming to how combat add-ons work in Midnight. Those changes would come in conjunction with Blizzard introducing its own version of popular add-on functions, like boss timers and damage meters, alongside improvements to recently implemented features like the cooldown manager and combat assistant. Blizzard also said it's designing combat encounters going forward so that (hopefully) combat add-ons wouldn't be as necessary as before.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SiIjThwKLaE" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/SiIjThwKLaE" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">That all sounded great on paper. Many assumed some of these changes would come over time, allowing for a period where both add-ons and Blizzard's own UI updates could work in conjunction or until certain parts of the base-game UI meant to replicate add-on functionality was ready. Blizzard has instead opted to rip off the proverbial band-aid.</p><p dir="ltr">In the Midnight alpha, nearly every piece of combat information is rendered invisible to add-ons and thus can't be computed or read to give players more information. That includes things as simple as how much health a player or enemy has, what abilities enemies are using, reading chat messages during combat, or whether there's a puddle of fire on the ground you should probably move out of. Combat add-ons may still work technically come Midnight, but they will require a ton of tweaks by creators and their functionality will likely be so much worse than the game's base UI (much of which still needs improvement) that there won't be much use for them.</p><p dir="ltr">The result has blindsided combat add-on developers and left them scrambling. The folks behind one of WoW's longest-running and most-popular add-ons, WeakAuras, have stated that unless Blizzard makes major changes to its approach, they won't be making a version for Midnight. In a <a href="https://www.patreon.com/posts/weakauras-x-140349416?utm_medium=clipboard_copy&amp;utm_source=copyLink&amp;utm_campaign=postshare_creator&amp;utm_content=join_link" rel="nofollow ">statement</a>, the WeakAuras team said Blizzard downplayed the scope and timing of its add-on approach in past statements, and that the current approach "does not leave us with much choice other than closing shop." Meanwhile, the creators of Deadly Boss Mods, WoW's most-popular add-on that has been downloaded more than 571 million times according to Curse Forge, have <a href="https://x.com/deadlybossmods?lang=en" rel="nofollow ">stated</a> the add-on isn't going anywhere but will be changing alongside WoW itself.</p><p dir="ltr">I'll just say it upfront: I don't like combat add-ons. I've played WoW for nearly two decades, and in that time I've always viewed them as a necessary evil. Whereas some players love spending hours making their own custom UIs and enabling WeakAuras to track their buffs and cooldowns, I've largely opted to instead stick with the default UI, finding the entire add-on process tedious.</p><p dir="ltr">A large part of this is because despite having played for the better part of 20 years, I have no real interest (or time) to participate in high-level Mythic+ dungeons or Mythic raiding, and thus have never viewed combat add-ons as essential as many top players do. I've also just never been a fan of the idea that I have to go to a third-party site and download something like Deadly Boss Mods, which up until this point has basically been viewed as mandatory for even casual WoW players, in order to play the game properly.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4584912-wowmidnightsilvermoon.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4584912" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4584912-wowmidnightsilvermoon.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4584912"></a><figcaption>Blizzard is overhauling WoW's old Blood Elf zones as part of Midnight.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4584912-wowmidnightsilvermoon.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Combat add-ons have always offered a major advantage to those who opted to use them compared to those who don't. This has always been a failure on Blizzard's part for allowing the add-on arms race between mod creators and the development team to go on for as long as it has. The same is true for designing WoW in a way that such add-ons felt like they had become necessary due to players not having all the information they needed to be successful.</p><p dir="ltr">Blizzard eliminating the need for combat add-ons is undoubtedly a good thing for WoW's long-term health, and something I'm not particularly upset about. I believe there are plenty of others who feel the same way. When combined with Blizzard's built-in UI updates and proposed changes to make combat more streamlined, WoW will soon be more approachable than ever before. It could also pave the way for WoW to be ported to consoles, exposing even more players to Blizzard's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-mmorpgs/2900-5436/">genre-defining MMORPG</a>. All of that is good.</p><p dir="ltr">There's only one issue: Blizzard's entire approach. By gutting combat add-ons immediately upon the start of Midnight, Blizzard is backing itself into an unnecessary corner. All of Blizzard's plans revolve around it actually being able to deliver all these features in time for the expansion's launch. If it can't replace all that add-on functionality on day-one, players are left with a worse version of the game.</p><p dir="ltr">While there are some features that are already ready from primetime, like the new nameplates, boss alerts, and the cooldown manager, there's plenty still missing. Damage meters and updated raid frames are huge pieces of the puzzle that aren't available for testing, and it's unclear when they will be. Raid frames in particular are huge for healers, who often use raid frame add-ons like VuhDo in order to be able to track their outgoing heals, priority debuffs, and more. Raid frame add-ons will still exist come Midnight, but they won't be able to track combat data as they currently do, a huge nerf to healers.</p><p dir="ltr">Blizzard does plan to offer some solutions here, but it's unlikely Blizzard's in-game versions will be as robust, customizable, or feature-rich as what many add-on users are accustomed to. That applies to just about every add-on Blizzard is looking to replace. Many of these add-ons have been updated and improved for over a decade. It's unreasonable to assume that Blizzard's versions will be at that same level right out the gate, assuming they are there at launch at all.</p><p dir="ltr">The success of Blizzard's plan also depends on its own encounter design. Until we see more of what Midnight's top-end raid boss encounters look like, it's impossible to say whether Blizzard has designed an endgame with no combat add-ons needed. WoW's Mythic difficulty encounters have been designed in a certain way for years, facilitating the need for combat add-ons in the first place. Having all that change in a single expansion requires a lot of trust in Blizzard to stick the landing, and I don't think players can be blamed for not entirely believing in its ability to execute.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4584914-wowmidnightendgamedesign.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4584914" data-ratio="0.56238244514107" data-width="1595" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4584914-wowmidnightendgamedesign.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4584914"></a><figcaption>Blizzard is aiming to design Midnight's endgame to not require combat add-ons in order to succeed.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4584914-wowmidnightendgamedesign.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">As for those unforeseen consequences I mentioned earlier, Blizzard's all-or-nothing approach is unfairly cruel to one particular portion of the WoW community: disabled players. These players can make extensive use of combat add-ons in order to play WoW, whether casually or at a high-level, as is the case with <a href="https://undauntedguild.com/about-us/" rel="nofollow ">Undaunted</a>, a well-known competitive WoW raiding guild for deaf and hard-of-hearing players. In a post on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/1ny1lg7/accessibility_impact_of_the_recent_addon_changes/" rel="nofollow ">Reddit</a>, Undaunted guild leader Saormash wrote an extensive breakdown of just how damaging losing "20 years of accessibility" is to the game's disabled community. Saormash said WoW has long been a leader when it comes to gaming accessibility thanks to the game's community of add-on creators. If Blizzard doesn't walk back some of its approach, that's due to all be tossed out the window.</p><p dir="ltr">"We will be completely locked out of progression due to something that is completely beyond our control," Saormash said. "In the past, we could turn to add-on and WeakAura creators for help. Without that benefit, we may see less tolerance from the raiding community for disabled players. Nobody will want to have their raid progress stalled by one person's inability to successfully pass a mechanic check."</p><p dir="ltr">Without the extensive ability to customize and tweak combat add-ons to meet their needs, these players will be left in the dust come Midnight without many new features being added to the game. Blizzard's UI design team simply cannot compete with the thousands of add-on creators who have created tools and solutions for players of all sorts for decades. As Saormash explained, despite the game's disabled community being the most negatively affected by the combat add-on apocalypse, it feels "unseen and unheard" by not being given the opportunity to provide direct feedback to Blizzard. It's unclear how long it will take Blizzard to implement the kinds of changes and features currently filled by WeakAuras and other add-ons that make the game playable for WoW's disabled community. Any answer longer than "immediately at launch" just isn't acceptable and reason alone to pump the brakes on this entire combat add-on crusade.</p><p dir="ltr">There is, at least, some indication Blizzard is listening. It's already walked back some combat add-on restrictions based on feedback. In a recent <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/world-of-warcraft/world-of-warcraft-director-admits-its-too-hard-without-combat-mods-and-explains-how-bosses-will-change-in-midnight-were-not-looking-to-turn-all-our-raid-encounters-into-giant-puzzles-for-people-to-solve/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PC Gamer</a> interview, WoW senior game director Ion Hazzikostas said it has now invited members of Undaunted into the Midnight testing program to receive their feedback, and that "accessibility remains a top focus for the team." Midnight also won't be launching until sometime in early 2026, giving Blizzard, at minimum, three or so months to listen, respond, and iterate on its plans. I have no doubt bigger changes to what is and isn't allowed in terms of combat add-ons will be coming in the weeks and months ahead, as well as more details about what players can expect from the game's updated raid frames and other UI improvements.</p><p dir="ltr">None of that, however, changes the fact that these are all problems entirely of Blizzard's own making. Not only were Blizzard's intentions and plans poorly communicated, but its choice to take the all-or-nothing approach to combat add-ons, without more closely involving the game's community beforehand, has resulted in confusion and frustration from some players.</p><p dir="ltr">Blizzard's overall goal here is admirable, and one that many players will likely agree with. Fast forward one, two, or five years and WoW might be the best it's ever been, with no need for combat add-ons, approachable endgame encounters, and all the accessibility features it needs to serve its community. But Blizzard is putting the cart before the horse. That future, idyllic version of WoW is not now, and given how Blizzard has handled this entire situation thus far, it might not be here in time for Midnight's launch either.</p>

                <p>One of the year's best indie games, Blue Prince, is getting an official <strong>physical PS5 release on November 21</strong>. Until now, it was only available digitally on consoles and PC, but fans can now preorder this new PS5-exclusive <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FPJRDTD5?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Blue Prince physical edition</a> for just $35 at Amazon. While the digital version of the game is also available on Xbox Series X and PC, PS5 is the only confirmed physical version--which isn't surprising, since that seems to be the case with most physical indie game releases these days. Along with the base game, physical copies will include an exclusive poster. Preordering also gets you a digital version of the game's soundtrack. It's probably wise to grab an early copy soon if you're interested--preorders for the Blue Prince PS5 edition initially went live about a month ago, and the first wave quickly sold out, so there's a chance this could disappear again soon.</p><h2>Blue Prince Physical Edition Preorder Bonuses</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4584983-dayoneblueprincepreorders.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4584983" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4584983-dayoneblueprincepreorders.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4584983"></a><figcaption>Blue Prince preorder bonus</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4584983-dayoneblueprincepreorders.jpg"></figure><p>Preordering Blue Prince physical edition gets you the Blue Prince: Day One Edition, which includes an exclusive download code for a digital copy of the game's official soundtrack.</p><div title="6535406 - Blue Prince Physical Edition" data-embed-type="buylink" data-ref-id="4687" data-template="4" data-size="buylink__listicle" data-title="6535406 - Blue Prince Physical Edition" data-collection="">             <h2>                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FPJRDTD5?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/B0FPJRDTD5?tag=gamespot-preorders-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FPJRDTD5?tag=gamespot-preorders-20">Blue Prince (PS5)</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FPJRDTD5?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/B0FPJRDTD5?tag=gamespot-preorders-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FPJRDTD5?tag=gamespot-preorders-20">$35 | Releases November 21</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <p>The Blue Prince PS5 release includes the full game on disc and an 18 x 12 inch fold-out poster featuring Mount Holly Manor, plus the digital soundtrack if you preorder the Day One Edition.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/amd-fsr-4-int8-xbox-series-x-simulation-shows-possible-advantage-in-image-quality-and-frame-rate.1324690/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Last month, following the accidental source code leak of AMD FSR 4 INT8 files, modders <a href="https://wccftech.com/leaked-amd-fsr-4-int8-files-helps-users-turn-on-fsr-4-on-rx-7000-on-windows/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">managed to get a version of AMD FSR4 working on non-RDNA 4 GPUs</a> (the Radeon RX 9000 Series that launched earlier this year). The regular version of the latest AMD upscaler runs on FP8, that is, the 8-bit Floating-Point format, which is not supported by prior RDNA GPUs. However, this leaked version running on INT8 is compatible with a much wider range of hardware, since support for the 8-bit Integer Fixed-Point format is included in most modern GPUs. </p>



<p>Of course, there's a reason why AMD chose the FP8 format for the public release: it allows for a wider dynamic range than INT8, doing a better job in preserving model accuracy and stability. Digital Foundry's Richard Leadbetter <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fqDWJCW06Ks" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">has now tested this version</a> on several non-RDNA4 hardware to see how well it works in terms of both performance and quality.</p>



<p>First of all, he compared the quality of AMD FSR 4 FP8 and AMD FSR 4 INT8, the first running on RDNA 4 hardware and the leaked version running on RDNA 3 and RDNA 2 hardware. The result is obvious: the INT8 version introduces aliasing and temporal artifacts. These visual issues are even more pronounced on the latest Adrenalin driver (25.9.1), likely due to some bug, so if you're going to try running the INT8 version, reverting to driver 23.9.1 is advisable.</p>



<p>That said, AMD FSR 4 INT8 does still provide superior upscaling quality compared to AMD FSR 3. The problem is that it's also a lot slower. Now, the PlayStation 5 consoles do not support INT8, but the Xbox Series X does, having access to the full RDNA 2 feature set. For a simulation of how Microsoft's console could run this version of the upscaler, Digital Foundry used an RX 6700 GPU running the Horizon Forbidden West benchmark. </p>



<p>AMD FSR 4 INT8 is by far the slowest upscaler compared to AMD FSR 3 and Intel XeSS, providing only a 28% performance uplift when set in Performance mode compared to 4K native resolution. XeSS Balance mode is 15% faster, while FSR 3 Performance mode is 29% faster. However, in another benchmark scene from Alan Wake 2, DF tested Xbox Series X-like settings at 1440p with FSR 4 set to Performance mode and FSR 2 to Balance mode. In this comparison, FSR 4 Performance mode slightly beats FSR 2 Balance mode in frame rate (by around 4%) and, more importantly, it provides a cleaner image despite reconstructing from a lower base resolution. </p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Leaked FSR4 INT8 Test: RDNA 3, RDNA 2, Steam Deck, Asus ROG Ally, Nvidia + Xbox Series X Simulation" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fqDWJCW06Ks?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Therefore, it could potentially benefit the Xbox Series X in certain scenarios. However, most multiplatform games are unlikely to take advantage of this since the base PS5 console cannot run AMD FSR 4 INT8. </p>



<p>The video analysis also includes a look at how this version performs on Steam Deck, though that scenario was already tested by other YouTubers, <a href="https://wccftech.com/amd-fsr-4-steam-deck/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">showing significant image quality improvements</a> but also a heavy performance cost in games like Cyberpunk 2077. Notably, this might not be the final version of AMD FSR 4 INT8, and Digital Foundry got a teasing statement from AMD on that note:</p>



<p><em>We look forward to more updates to FSR4 this Fall that will continue to improve gamers' experiences.</em></p>



<p>It's not quite a confirmation, but this version of FSR 4 may receive some performance improvements that would make it more viable for RDNA 2 and RDNA 3 hardware. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The Outer Worlds 2 release is nearly here, bringing many people who loved the original game back into this universe where business executives overrule everyone.</p>



<p>With the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-is-the-outer-worlds-2-review-embargo-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">embargo date set to reveal review scores</a> for the upcoming game, you will want to have a good understanding of when the game is actually released so you can play it.</p>



<p>Here is everything we know about The Outer Worlds 2 release date and a possible start time.</p>



<h2 id="h-when-does-the-outer-worlds-2-release">When Does The Outer Worlds 2 Release?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Charging up for release. Image by Obsidian Entertainment</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>The Outer Worlds 2 full release date is on October 29, but anyone who </strong><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-get-the-outer-worlds-2-early-access/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>pre-orders the Premium Edition</strong></a><strong> will be able to play the game five days early on October 24.</strong></p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-the-outer-worlds-2-coming-to-game-pass/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscribers</a> will be able to download and play the game on that later date, but if they desire to play early and get all the rest of the content included in the Premium Edition, they can buy the $30 upgrade pack on the Xbox Store.</p>



<p>It might not be the perfect festive game for Halloween, but fans of the first game will hardly complain about being able to run around and mess with the various corporations and NPCs just before the holiday.</p>



<h2 id="h-do-we-know-the-exact-release-time-for-the-outer-worlds-2">Do We Know the Exact Release Time for The Outer Worlds 2?</h2>



<p><strong>According to the </strong><a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP6312-PPSA24588_00-0872768154966924" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow"><strong>PlayStation Store</strong></a><strong>, the standard edition of The Outer Worlds 2 will go live at 1 PM ET on October 29, so this version of the game will not have a midnight release. That is not the same for the early access players, who will be able to play starting at 12 AM ET on October 24.</strong></p>



<p>Here is a chart that will break down the starting times for the standard version of The Outer Worlds 2.</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th data-align="center">Time Zone</th><th data-align="center">The Outer Worlds 2 Standard Start Time</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-align="center">Eastern Time (ET)</td><td data-align="center">1 PM—October 29</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Central Time (CT)</td><td data-align="center">12 PM—October 29</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Pacific Time (PT)</td><td data-align="center">10 AM—October 29</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Greenwich Mean Time (GMT)</td><td data-align="center">5 PM—October 29</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Australian Eastern Daylight Time (AEDT)</td><td data-align="center">4 AM—October 30</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>The standard edition of The Outer Worlds 2 releasing at midday in the United States is definitely an odd time for the full game to release. Usually, even with games that have an early access period, they will become playable at either midnight Eastern Time or sometime in the morning. Having it set for the afternoon is definitely not the norm with big releases like this.</p>

                <p>Summer Game Fest 2026 has been announced, and there is one big change that we know about so far. The event takes place on Friday, June 5 in Los Angeles, and the show is moving to the Dolby Theatre.</p><p>The 2025 event, for comparison, was held at the YouTube Theater in Inglewood, California. The Dolby Theatre opened in Hollywood in 2001 and hosts the Oscars each year. It was previously known as the Kodak Theatre.</p><p>Geoff Keighley once again returns to produce Summer Game Fest 2026. Keighley runs SGF and The Game Awards, and Split Fiction writer-director Josef Fares once declared during TGA, <a href="https://google.com/search?q=josef+fares+fuck+the+oscars+gamespot&amp;rlz=1C5GCCM_en&amp;oq=josef+fares+fuck+the+oscars+gamespot&amp;gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUyBggAEEUYOdIBCDQzMTJqMGo5qAIGsAIB8QU6HXKJFs428w&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">"F**k the Oscars,"</a> a statement that carries a bit more resonance now with SGF changing venues to where the Oscars are held.</p><p>SGF 2026 promises a "spectacular, cross-platform showcase of what's next in video games." You can attend the event yourself by purchasing a ticket when they go on sale in Spring 2026.</p><p>As for TGA, the upcoming awards show run by Keighley will take place on Thursday, December 11 at the Peacock Theater in Los Angeles.</p>

                <p>In 2003, Vince Zampella and his Infinity Ward co-founders unleashed the original <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/call-of-duty/" data-ref-id="5000-18165">Call of Duty</a> after previously shepherding EA's Medal of Honor franchise. The latter never reached the heights of the former, and according to Zampella, Call of Duty would have never come into being if EA hadn't come into conflict with his team.</p><p>"The only reason that Call of Duty exists is because EA were dicks," said Zampella during a new interview with <a href="https://www.gq-magazine.co.uk/article/battlefield-6-vince-zampella" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">GQ</a>. Zampella didn't elaborate on his team's fallout with EA, but they eventually formed a lucrative partnership with Activision, which purchased Infinity Ward. Zampella left Infinity Ward in 2010 and formed Respawn Entertainment before once again partnering with EA. Now, Zampella is overseeing the Battlefront franchise, which continues this month with the arrival of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/battlefield-6/" data-ref-id="5000-687940">Battlefield 6</a>.</p><p>Zampella worked closely with Steven Spielberg on the Metal of Honor games, and Spielberg reportedly wanted to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/spielberg-wanted-to-make-a-call-of-duty-movie-but-activision-passed-heres-the-reported-reason-why/1100-6534500/" data-ref-id="1100-6534500">direct a Call of Duty movie</a> years later. During the GQ interview, Zampella noted that Ridley Scott was also interested in bringing Call of Duty to the big screen.</p><p>"Ridley Scott came in one time--who's a hero of mine--but he's not connected to games," noted Zampella. "So he'd ask these questions like, 'How do you script what happens?' ... There was a bit of a talk around him doing a Call of Duty film, but we never really took it seriously. Video game movies at that point were never really that good."</p><p>Last month, Paramount signed a deal with Activision for <a href="https://variety.com/2025/film/news/call-of-duty-movie-paramount-skydance-1236504600/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">a Call of Duty movie</a>, with a potential TV series to follow. It's unclear if Hollywood will show similar interest in Battlefield, but <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-is-already-doing-huge-numbers-on-steam/1100-6535398/" data-ref-id="1100-6535398">Battlefield 6 is already doing huge numbers on Steam</a>. Battlefield 6 also has a largely clear path before <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-7/">Black Ops 7</a> arrives on November 14.</p>

                <p>The creative lead steering the Assassin's Creed franchise for Ubisoft has departed the company. The exit comes not long after the French publisher unveiled its Tencent-backed <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-announces-vantage-studios-a-creative-house-focused-on-three-major-franchises/1100-6535136/" data-ref-id="1100-6535136">spin-off division Vantage Studios,</a> which will take charge of development for Assassin's Creed, Far Cry, and Rainbow Six titles.</p><p>Vantage Studios said that Marc-Alexis Côté, who held the title of Vice President Executive Producer for Assassin's Creed since 2022, had been offered a leadership position at this new subsidiary, but he declined the role, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-franchise-boss-departs-ubisoft" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN</a> reports.

      </div>
<p>In an internal email to Ubisoft staff, Vantage Studios co-CEO Christophe Derennes expressed disappointment with Côté's decision, adding that Côté "had his own expectations and priorities related to Vantage Studios' creation and future."</p><p>Côté began his two-decade-long tenure at Ubisoft in 2005 as a software engineer, accumulating credits including Prince of Persia: The Forgotten Sands and several Assassin's Creed games.</p><p>He led the mission design for Assassin's Creed Brotherhood before acting as a game director for Assassin's Creed 3. Côté was also the creative director for Assassin's Creed Syndicate, and he led the development of Assassin's Creed Odyssey.</p><p>As the franchise's head, starting in 2022, Côté led the initiative to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-infinity-gets-a-new-name/1100-6524281/" data-ref-id="1100-6524281">group future titles into the Animus Hub</a> for a more cohesive story experience. Assassin's Creed Shadows, which was released earlier this year, was the first game to be a part of this platform.</p><p>"We are deeply grateful for the impact Marc-Alexis has had over the years, particularly in shaping the Assassin’s Creed brand into what it is today," an Ubisoft spokesperson told IGN. "His leadership, creativity, and dedication have left a lasting mark on our teams and our players. We thank him sincerely for his many contributions and wish him continued success in all his future endeavors."</p><p>A recent leak suggests that the Assassin's Creed franchise will make its first foray to Nintendo Switch 2 with an Assassin's Creed Shadows port, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-switch-2-release-date-reportedly-leaks/1100-6535405/" data-ref-id="1100-6535405">purportedly releasing in December</a>. In other franchise news, a report claimed that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-canceled-civil-war-based-assassins-creed-over-controversy-concerns-report/1100-6535320/" data-ref-id="1100-6535320">Ubisoft axed an American Civil War-set Assassin's Creed title</a> last year due to concerns involving the current political climate in the United States.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>After shaking up the Pokémon formula with <em>Pokémon Legends: Arceus</em>, its successor, <em>Legends: Z-A</em>, pushes things even further — and it’s a very welcome change of pace.</p><p>With <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22898939/pokemon-legends-arceus-review-nintendo-switch"><em>Arceus</em></a>, Nintendo and Game Freak demonstrated how much more vibrant, weird, and exciting the monster catching series could become with a few key changes to the classic formula. <em>Arceus</em>’ historical story and open-ish world made the <em>Pokémon</em> universe feel like a bigger, wilder place, just as the revamped battling and catching mechanics turned the familiar process of filling out your pokédex into a completely different kind of experience.</p><p>After years of the mainline <em>Pokémon </em>titles feeling like slight variations of one another, <em>Arceus </em>was a breath of air so invigorating that it was easy to imagine it becoming a new blueprint for the series. That initially seemed to be the plan with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23462858/pokemon-violet-scarlet-review-nintendo-switch"><em>Pokémon Scarlet </em>/<em> Violet</em></a><em>.</em> But those truly open-world adventures were plagued by <a href="https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/679031/pokemon-violet-scarlet-switch-2-update-hands-on">innumerable technical issues</a>, and their uneven plotlines are best described as undercooked.</p><p>There was such a vast gap in quality between <em>Arceus </em>and <em>Scarlet </em>/ <em>Violet </em>that it was hard to tell where the franchise was going. But with its dramatically revamped battles and more immersive world, <em>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</em> (which I played on the Switch 2) is a fantastic return to form. And it’s one that feels like another example of how the <em>Legends</em> games’ experimental features could become the new standard as the series marches into the future.</p><p>Whereas <em>Arceus</em> transported you to the distant past when humans were first learning how to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/5/18/23123756/pokemon-hisuian-snow-arceus">coexist with pokémon in the vast Hisui region</a>,<em> Z-A </em>picks up in the present shortly after the events of <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-x-y-the-kotaku-review-1444323788"><em>Pokémon X </em>/ <em>Y</em></a> and takes place entirely in the Kalos region’s capital. Longtime residents of Lumiose City remember how their home was nearly destroyed by a nihilistic maniac hell-bent on wiping out humanity and pokémon alike in order to make the world a more “beautiful” place. But as a tourist visiting Lumiose — a walkable metropolis inspired by Paris — for the very first time, all your character really knows about the city is that it is <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/27/24083767/pokemon-legends-z-a-nintendo-switch-2025-launch-date">in the process of being built back stronger than ever</a>.</p><p>Overseen and financed by the Quasartico company, Lumiose’s ambitious redevelopment plan aims to turn the city into a place where humans and pokémon can live peacefully alongside one another. Lumiose is flush with newly built housing for people, and the city’s Wild Zones — sectioned-off areas filled with naturally occurring features — are spaces where wild pokémon can thrive. But as smoothly as the redevelopment plan has been going for the most part, there is also a growing concern about the rising number of dangerous Mega-Evolved pokémon that have begun appearing in Lumiose without explanation, and your character eventually joins a squad intent on solving that mystery.</p><p>Part of what made <em>Arceus </em>feel so pleasantly different from other <em>Pokémon </em>titles was the way it drastically reworked familiar gameplay elements as reflections of its historical setting. You could still battle wild pokémon and other trainers in turn-based matches, but the game also put a unique emphasis on stealthily catching monsters without needing to engage them in fights. Tonally, <em>Arceus </em>was also darker and more foreboding than previous <em>Pokémon </em>entries, which made sense for a game where untamed alpha pokémon would frequently try <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/21/22738353/new-pokemon-legends-arceus-trailer-hisuian-zorua-zoroark-nintendo-switch">to maul you on sight</a>.</p><p>Similarly,<em> Z-A </em>frames the Rogue Mega Evolution phenomenon as one of the major reasons why your character has to be cautious as they roam around Lumiose. But almost all of the pokémon you encounter in the Wild Zones (and a few other places) are capable of knocking your character out with just a few hits. Once again, you have the ability to sneak through tall grass and bushes to hurl pokéballs at unsuspecting pokémon. Stealth catching often works like a charm when it comes to the game’s lower-level monsters you meet early on, but when it comes to alphas, you usually have to send a partner into battle.</p><p><em>Z-A</em>’s wildly reworked battling mechanics are by far the biggest change. In place of the traditional turn-based system, fights now take place in real time with attacks being assigned to the Switch’s four face buttons and recharging on specific timers. At first, even simple battles can feel chaotic because of how many things there are to keep track of. You have to tell your pokémon which attacks to use, understand that attack’s range, and keep your human character moving in order to guide your monsters across the battlefield. If you use items from your satchel, you also have to be mindful of the cooldown timer before you can open the bag again.</p><p>The system took me a while to get used to because the mainline <em>Pokémon </em>games have always been about making measured, calculated moves. But once I got a feel for the way my Tepig could fire off an Ember attack and quickly follow it up with a Tackle, I could start to see how <em>Z-A </em>wants you to battle in a (slightly twitchy) kind of flow state.</p><p>Strategy is still important here — understanding your monster’s type advantages / disadvantages and its strongest stats can be the deciding factors in fights. But <em>Z-A </em>feels like a game that was designed with the idea of embracing the chaos that would result from groups of magical animals attacking each other with elemental superpowers. A well-timed Flame Wheel / Rollout one-two punch became a go-to combo once my Tepig leveled up. But there were more than a couple of instances where that aggressive approach to fighting stronger opponents left my pig monster in danger of getting hit before I could tell him to run out of the way.</p><p>Battling becomes even trickier once the game properly introduces Mega Evolution — a returning mechanic from the <em>X </em>/<em> Y </em>era that temporarily changes certain pokémon’s physical form and boosts their stats. In <em>X </em>/<em> Y</em>, you could only Mega Evolve one pokémon per battle, and the transformation would revert back if your chosen monster fainted before the match was completed. <em>Z-A </em>switches things up considerably by introducing a gauge that charges up with energy before you can trigger Mega Evolution by pressing the right joystick. As long as the gauge is full, you can Mega Evolve your pokémon (if they’re a species capable of doing it) as many times as you want, which is handy when you’re facing off against the Rogue Mega Evolved pokémon that function as some of <em>Z-A</em>’s boss battles.</p><p>The game eases you into its battles by making them a key part of how the story progresses. By day, Lumiose is a glamorous urban hub where people and their pokémon partners spend time relaxing at cafes, browsing museums, and shopping at boutiques. But at night, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/637256/pokemon-legends-z-a-trailer-day-night-cycle">random sections of the city are transformed into battle zones</a> where ambitious trainers participate in the Z-A Royale, a riff on the traditional gyms.</p><p>At the beginning of every night cycle, a Battle Zone lights up in red and becomes filled with trainers of various ranks who you have to defeat in order to collect a designated number of points. And once you’ve got enough points, you unlock a special, slightly more difficult battle that determines whether you move up a rank. In previous <em>Pokémon </em>games, it could be easy to blow through gym battles because of how leaders and their associated trainers all used the same types of monsters. But many of the Z-A Royale’s participants use more eclectic teams of pokémon, which requires more thinking on the fly. The Z-A Royale is also a fantastic showcase of what kinds of people live in Lumiose — there are socialites, waiters, and overworked delivery workers who all want a taste of glory.</p><p>Lumiose’s expansiveness feels like a big step forward after recent <em>Pokémon </em>games for the Switch. I spent hours wandering around listening to / reading people’s conversations, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/784264/pokemon-legends-z-a-hands-on-fashion-nintendo-switch-2">building an expansive wardrobe</a>, and appreciating the horn-heavy, accordion-accented smooth jazz soundtrack. The city could use a bit more visual detail, but it’s a substantial improvement; <em>Scarlet </em>/ <em>Violet</em>’s towns felt more like lifeless dioramas, and <em>Arceus </em>simply didn’t have all that many places where you could vibe for the hell of it.</p><p>There are also welcome quality-of-life tweaks. For instance, <em>Z-A </em>introduces a character whose entire job is to keep track of pokéballs that you’ve lost and return them to you. Little details like that feel like the game’s way of keeping resource gathering grind to a minimum so that you can focus on more interesting things. Other tweaks make your pokémon feel more like a partner. Rather than trees that you need the Cut move to get past, Lumiose is filled with rubble, tree stumps, and piles of sludge that you can only clear by summoning a pokémon and making it use moves that make sense. I got into the habit of using my pokémon’s Rock Smash to pulverize piles of cracked stones, but I was surprised to learn that the move wouldn’t work on stones located higher up off the ground just out of my monster’s reach.</p><p>Clever little details like that kept surprising me as I got deeper into <em>Z-A</em> and really began to feel a kind of immersion this series has never quite been able to achieve before. Dialogue is still written out in text rather than being voiced over, but when your character does a parkour move to climb up a building, you can hear them audibly exerting themselves. There is something very cool about seeing your pokémon conjure a wave just to wash away garbage or a lightning bolt to recharge a broken elevator. Meanwhile, the battles pull you from the sidelines and put you in the midst of the chaos.</p><p>Though <em>Z-A </em>and <em>Arceus </em>share a similar experimental energy, the new game is more polished and robust. <em>Z-A </em>is launching with <a href="https://legends.pokemon.com/en-us/news/z-a-battle-club">an online battling mode</a>, there has already been an <a href="https://www.theverge.com/pokemon/777169/pokemon-legends-za-mega-dimension-dlc-nmega-raichu">announcement about a DLC expansion</a>, and on the technical side <em>Z-A </em>feels much more like what you would expect from a flagship game meant to help usher in <a href="https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/686603/nintendo-switch-2-review">a new generation of hardware</a>.</p><p>While I enjoyed playing <em>Z-A </em>on the Switch 2, I can’t speak to how the game runs on the original Switch. That’s important <a href="https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/679031/pokemon-violet-scarlet-switch-2-update-hands-on">given how improved <em>Scarlet </em>/ <em>Violet </em>were from Nintendo’s previous hardware</a>, and that kind of performance gap here could be a deal-breaker for people who haven’t upgraded. But <em>Z-A </em>makes a strong showing as the Switch 2’s first major <em>Pokémon </em>debut, illustrating how this series is at its best when it gets experimental. And hopefully some of this good energy gets channeled into the next generation of <em>Pokémon </em>games.</p><p><em>Pokémon Legends: Z-A </em>releases for the Nintendo Switch and Switch 2 on October 16th.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6OTE="><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Charles Pulliam-Moore</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games/798848/pokemon-legends-za-review-nintendo-switch-2]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>It’s been three years since the last Pokémon games, <em>Scarlet</em> and <em>Violet</em>. For the average player that might be a refreshing break, but for the hardcore fans that’s practically a lifetime. Does <em>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</em> deliver after all that waiting, or is it more of a stop-gap entry that feels overshadowed by how long overdue it is? According to early reviews it’s just good enough to reward fans’ patience, even if it’s not the mold-shattering standout in the<em> Pokémon</em> series some have been hoping for.</p> <p><em>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</em> is currently hovering around 81 on <em><a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/pokemon-legends-z-a/">Metacritic</a></em> with 40 reviews currently published. That’s a few points below 2022’s<em> Pokémon Legends: Arceus</em> but a healthy bump up from the performance-issue-riddled <em>Scarlet</em> and <em>Violet</em>. Most reviewers of the newest entry said it runs well on Switch 2 with no real graphical hitches and a solid 60fps performance throughout the game, though <em>VGC</em> reported that it still feels like the sequel is being held back by being developed on last-gen hardware as well.</p>

 <p>In terms of gameplay, <em>Z-A</em> trades <em>Arceus</em>‘ watercolor-esque wilderness for an urban labyrinth of streets, skyscrapers, and small public parks. Some reviewers found it visually boring, even if there are plenty of activities to keep the city of Lumiose feeling lively and entertaining. <em>Nintendo Life</em> was not impressed with the setting, calling the new urban playground “lifeless” and restrictive-feeling. What most early reviews seem to agree on is that<em> Z-A</em>‘s Mega Evolutions, overhauled raids, and real-time hybrid combat subverts the standard flow of a <em>Pokémon</em> game in fun and interesting ways, making the battles a standout for the series.</p> <p>It’s worth noting that this is still just a small sample of the initial critical feedback for <em>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</em>. Reviewers apparently only received code five days before today’s review embargo, and restrictions prohibit them from talking about certain parts of the game. It also doesn’t seem like anyone’s had an opportunity to test it on Switch 1 yet either, the platform that most fans will be playing it on. <em>Kotaku</em> will have its own coverage starting on the October 16 release date, but in the meantime here’s what else early reviews are saying about the newest Pokémon game.</p> <h2><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-legends-z-a-review"><em>IGN</em></a></h2> <blockquote><p>Man, I was going to try and hold back a bit on this review-in-progress since I still have plenty to see before my final review, but I’m just so genuinely excited about what Game Freak has done here. I liked <em>Arceus</em> a fair amount and thought it showed promise, but have been broadly disappointed with the slow backslide I saw from the studio in its move to console game development, and worried the quality dip was a new trend for 3D Pokémon games that we’d never escape. <em>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</em>, at least across the first two-dozen hours, is putting a lot of my fears to rest. It’s not revolutionary by any stretch, but it’s really good! I’m having fun, I’m excited to keep playing, I feel rewarded for exploring every corner, the story’s got my attention, and I’m not distracted by my Pokémon falling through the floor while they battle or everything crashing when I try to climb a ladder. If the rest of my adventure holds up (and the Switch 1 performance isn’t a disaster), we could finally have a 3D game worthy of the Pokémon franchise on our hands. It’d be about dang time. — Rebekah Valentine (review-in-progress)</p></blockquote> <h2><em><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-legends-z-a-review">Eurogamer</a></em></h2> <blockquote><p>Like the last three main series games before it,<em> Pokémon Legends: Z-A</em> comes with hefty caveats. It gets repetitive after a while. It’s still visually limited, despite the huge improvements on the last pair. It’s still missing dungeons, deep mysteries, a sense of big challenge to build up to, prepare for and overcome. But then it has charm in spades, from [its] humour right through to its soundtrack (a smooth, jazzy, wistful, accordion-based treat). There’s even an <em>homage</em> to a dungeon, that feels if nothing else like a fantastic proof of concept for one day bringing them back in 3D. — Chris Tapsell</p></blockquote> <h2><a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/pokemon/pokemon-legends-z-a-review/"><em>Gamesradar</em></a></h2> <blockquote><p>Crucially, living and breathing city life for an entire RPG means the return to Kalos feels like a true slice of life in the Pokemon world that you’re a part of. That dream sold to us by the Pokemon anime? It’s right here, clearer than it ever has been in the actual games, and it’s impossible not to get caught up in the joy of that as you wake up and leave your new residence of Hotel Z in a morning, wild Fletchling and Pidgey flying past and perching gently on streetlights as you run down the streets with your Pokemon by your side. The lack of regional adventure may not be to everyone’s taste, but if you’ve ever fantasized about living in the Pokemon world like I have, there’s a lot to love here. — Catherine Lewis</p></blockquote> <h2><a href="https://www.rpgsite.net/review/18695-pokemon-legends-z-a-review"><em>RPG Site</em></a></h2> <blockquote> <p data-handler="v1">Where <em>Arceus</em> de-emphasized trainer battles and towns in lieu of exploring a Sinnoh region before wider settlements had been established,<em> Z-A</em> consolidates the entirety of its experience within the urban setting of Kalos’ Lumiose City. While an increasing number of Wild Zones dot Lumiose’s landmarks, by far the star of the show is trainer battles, primarily within the <em>Z-A</em> Royale; a tournament held every night in a rotating district, as trainers compete to raise their rank in pursuit of the promise of their wish being granted. — James Galizio</p> </blockquote> <figure></figure> <h2><em><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/pokemon-legends-z-a-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Nintendo Life</a></em></h2> <blockquote><p>While I was wandering around the cobbles of Lumiose, I realized it all felt very compact. The city is essentially one big open zone, with a fair amount of verticality. But that means I’d run through and explored the entire place within about five hours. Sure, more Wild Zones unlock as you progress, bringing more Pokémon to catch. But it left very few surprises for the entire game.</p> <p>I also wish it looked better, too. Lumiose has a few lovely sights here and there, but on the whole, <em>Legends: Z-A</em> appears lifeless. <em>Arceus</em> wasn’t a graphical showcase, but that watercolor-style aesthetic gave it a really unique feel. <em>New Pokémon Snap</em> looks so much better and more vibrant than this. If clothes can swish around and hair flow through the wind, why can’t we have windows that aren’t just flat textures or shadows that don’t look like bleeding ink blotches on the floor? It’s a little better docked, but not much. — Alana Hagues</p></blockquote> <h2><a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/review/pokemon-legends-z-a-review/"><em>VGC</em></a></h2> <blockquote><p>The<em> Pokémon Legends</em> series feels like it’s settling old scores.&nbsp;<em>Pokémon Legends: Arceus</em>&nbsp;allowed Game Freak to tell the epic story of <em>Arceus</em> (and finally have him easily catchable worldwide in a game), while also serving as a pseudo-remake/tribute to Generation 4 for those who didn’t love BDSP.</p> <p><em>Pokémon Legends Z-A</em> is a game that understands its audience and feels like a love letter to both players who grew up with X &amp; Y and those who’ve been here the whole time. Lumoise City is finally as grand as Game Freak tried to make it with the limited power of the 3DS, and Zygarde not only earns plenty of focus, but<em> Z-A</em> will likely propel it from total obscurity to a fan favorite. — Jordan Middler</p></blockquote>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The head of Assassin’s Creed has reportedly left Ubisoft after the launch of the company’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisofts-new-company-officially-launches-today/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new subsidiary with Tencent</a>.</p>



<p>According to reports, franchise vice president and executive producer Marc-Alexis Côté is no longer with the company. The news was broken to the company via an internal email. </p>



<p>Per <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-franchise-boss-departs-ubisoft" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the memo sent</a> to staff and first reported by IGN, Vantage Studios’ co-CEOs Christophe Derennes and Charlie Guillemot said that Côté was offered a leadership role within the company, but he declined the opportunity. It was a decision that the studio leads say they were “disappointed” by. They added that Côté had “<strong>his own expectations and priorities related to Vantage Studios’ creation and future.”</strong></p>



<p>In a statement provided to Insider Gaming, an Ubisoft spokesperson said,<strong> “Following the organizational restructuring announced in March 2025,&nbsp;Marc-Alexis Côté&nbsp;has chosen to pursue a new path elsewhere outside of Ubisoft. While we are saddened to see him go, we’re confident that our talented teams will carry forward the strong foundation he helped build.</strong></p>

<p><strong>“We are deeply grateful for the impact Marc-Alexis has had over the years, particularly in shaping the Assassin’s Creed brand into what it is today. His leadership, creativity, and dedication have left a lasting mark on our teams and our players. We thank him sincerely for his many contributions and wish him continued success in all his future endeavors.”</strong></p>



<p>Côté&nbsp;first <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/marcalexis/details/experience/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">joined Ubisoft in 2005</a> as a software engineer. Over the last 20 years, he had moved up through the company as a lead programmer, level designer, game director, and executive producer. Games produced under his watch include Assassin’s Creed III, Assassin’s Creed Syndicate, and Assassin’s Creed Odyssey, among others. </p>



<p>Since 2022, Côté&nbsp;has been responsible for the “overall strategy for the Assassin’s Creed franchise”. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">What next for Sucker Punch now <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/ghost-of-yotei">Ghost of Yotei</a> is out the door? The Sony-owned studio has yet to say, but based on comments from the boss of the company, it will remain a single-project studio.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In an interview with <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/sucker-punch-will-remain-a-single-project-studio-after-ghost-of-yotei-boss-suggests/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">VGC</a>, Sucker Punch co-founder and studio head, Brian Fleming, said the studio will decide its next project once the multiplayer add-on Ghost of Yotei: Legends comes out in 2026. But, he suggested, don’t expect a flurry of games from the relatively lean developer — it’s one project at a time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“The truth is that whatever we do next, whether it’s continuing Ghost or going back to Sly, the decision is really more limited by, again, our cherishing of focus and time to iterate, which means that we really can only do one thing at a time,” he said.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“If we were good at juggling four projects, yeah, we’d have a remaster, and let’s go do one of those, and one of those, and do some fan request, that would be really popular… But we only get to do one thing.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“So it kind of has to be your best idea, right? And that’s really clarifying. It’s not like there aren’t 15 good ideas. But you only get to do one. And by the way, you only get to do one about every five years. So that choice is really important. I mean, that is choosing your college and your major every five years.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Sucker Punch has plenty to draw from in its back catalog. As Fleming mentioned, one of its classic franchises is Sly Cooper, which fans have called to return in some form. And what about the inFamous series? Would a remaster then a sequel prove successful? And then there’s the prospect of another Ghost game, following Tsushima and Yotei. Everyone loves a trilogy, after all.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The Best PS5 Games</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">While we wait to find out, check out IGN’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ghost-of-yotei-review">Ghost of Yotei review</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">It took less than one week for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/battlefield-6"><u>Battlefield 6</u></a> players to start making Portal lobbies for XP farming – and some believe EA has already caught on.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fans were quick to call out the progression system in last week’s new FPS entry as a bit of a slog. Although most are walking away from each multiplayer match happy with the package Battlefield Studios has crafted, even some of the most enthusiastic fans believe leveling up takes too long, with an unrewarding weapon unlock system and arduous challenges dampening the experience even further.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><div data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>The general unlock process in Battlefield 6 is too slow.</p><p>I understand wanting to make it challenging for players to get the best stuff, but I'm dreading how long it's going to take to bring just a few guns up to a decent level for attachments etc, and I'm an engaged player.…</p></div>— Westie (@MrProWestie) <a href="https://twitter.com/MrProWestie/status/1977628190337110471?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">October 13, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">“Do they really think players have that much time and energy to grind endlessly just to get the rewards we’re supposed to earn naturally?” <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1o3jwbb/dice_what_are_you_thiking_weapon_and_character/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>one player asked</u></a> in a Reddit post. “It’s exhausting.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Just days removed from launch, plenty of players already feel the grind is too much to put up with – especially for casual fans – but that’s where Portal comes in. The do-it-yourself mode, which was first introduced in 2021’s Battlefield 2042, allows players to create nearly any match or mode they can dream of. The right build can even allow Portal users to earn experience as if they are playing a standard multiplayer match, so, naturally, it took just days for XP farm servers to crop up.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Content creators like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-rFuu5QZPwI" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Arekkz Gaming</u></a>, <a href="https://youtu.be/4t5Df2dvxC0?si=YkpqCptbOl2dsogJ&amp;t=877" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>TheCadWoman</u></a>, and <a href="https://youtu.be/mclOIKZ7BOU?si=MDUyyH_mlD_PLN0_&amp;t=434" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>WhosImmortal</u></a>, who are just a few of the many spreading the word, recommend specific Portal lobbies to level up fast. Most relevant lobbies are populated with bots but stick close enough to standard Battlefield 6 modes so as not to alter the rate of gained XP. Players are often then instructed to use double XP tokens (if they have any) and kill AI/bot enemies near objectives to efficiently farm XP.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">A desire to boost through demanding progression systems has existed long before Battlefield 6, so XP farm servers in Portal were quickly populated full of impatient fans. Some suspect that EA, though, is just as quick.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">As more XP farm lobbies fill the Portal community browser, players are finding themselves met with a “Global Game Quota Exceeded” message with little explanation. It’s led fans to believe EA and BF Studios have begun cracking down on suspicious lobbies in order to keep boosters from exploiting Battlefield 6 and its Portal toolkit.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The error is certainly keeping some XP farmers from continuing to reap the rewards they desire, but it’s unclear if these messages are the result of direct action to pour cold water on farming. Portal players have <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1o4eyj9/the_global_portal_quota_needs_to_be_upsized/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>reported receiving the message</u></a> regardless of their lobby hosting intentions. Some haven’t even been able to start hosting servers at all, suggesting Battlefield 6 Portal servers may simply be struggling <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-6-gets-off-to-huge-start-on-steam-with-over-740000-concurrent-players-just-hours-after-launch">in the wake of massive player numbers from last week’s launch</a>. There’s also been no word from EA or BF Studios regarding any moves to stamp out XP farming.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s unclear why exactly the Global Game Quote Exceeded message is popping up around the user-generated community tab, but that doesn’t mean the popularity of XP farming isn’t playing a role. The widespread criticism of Battlefield 6’s progression system has led to an overflow of servers for players looking to unlock content as quickly as possible. Some dedicated Portal creators suspect this large number of individual lobbies isn’t exactly helping unclog the Battlefield 6 online experience.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Battlefield 6 launched October 10 for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X and S, then promptly rocketed its way to become <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-6-gets-off-to-huge-start-on-steam-with-over-740000-concurrent-players-just-hours-after-launch"><u>the most successful Steam launch for the long-running EA franchise ever</u></a>, reaching a peak of more than 740,000 concurrent users.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While we wait to see how EA and BF Studios might address XP farming and progression in Battlefield 6, be sure to check out <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-6-launched-just-hours-ago-and-players-have-already-recreated-call-of-duty-map-shipment-in-portal">how some Portal players used their power to recreate Call of Duty’s Shipment</a>.

<p>Developer Sam Eng actually pulled a fast one and released Skate Story's Steam Next Fest demo a bit early. It debuted at the tail end of last week, jumping the big queue of cool things each Next Fest has become. Despite my British sense of etiquette, I'll forgive him, because he did at least <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1263240/view/501711331410315348?l=english">pair it with some big news</a>. Skate Story will release on December 8th, 2025.</p>
<p>On that day, you'll be able to take in nine chapters of the answer to the following question: 'What if Tony Hawk's soul was sent to a realm of nightmare surrealism, and was also a bit peckish?' On this day, you can give the first chapter a whirl in the demo, which I've just kickflipped through in about 35 minutes.</p><p>As far as I can tell, it's the same demo Brendan, no doubt using his mysterious skateboarding magicks, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/a-skate-story-demo-has-me-yearning-for-its-knee-shattering-flow-state">managed to get his hands on back in 2024</a>. Curse you, Caldwell, one day we'll see your cupboard of evil tricks flung open, no doubt to reveal a bit of paper which reads 'I just asked the dev, and they said there you go'.</p>
<p>Anyway, I've given it a go and it's just as cool as ol' Brendo said. I particularly enjoyed dispelling the smiling block's manhole guffs, and the section which sees your skater glide through space to kickflip at a celestial body. The soundtrack being more akin to Disco Elsyium's chill Sea Power symphony than the usual pop punk performances blasting in skating games will take a bit of getting used to. If you're interested in finding out more about the artist behind it, Blood Cultures, there's a bit of chat with them in the Steam post I linked earlier.</p>
<p>"Skate Story is based on a true story," Eng wrote in that same post. "Yes, that’s right folks. Sure, it’s slightly dramatized for effect, but it’s all totally 100% true. Of course, names and places have been altered as well, for the privacy of those involved. For example, it was not originally a Frog who ran the bagel shop, and the Skater actually had to get a lawyer before signing the Devil’s Contract."</p>
<p>Cool. Skate Story's demo's on its <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1263240/Skate_Story/">Steam page</a>, where you can also wishlist it ahead of that December release.</p>
