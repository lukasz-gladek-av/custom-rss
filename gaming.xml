              <p>For years, Sonos made its name with WiFi streaming alone, avoiding Bluetooth at all costs to keep audio quality high. It finally relented with portable speakers, realizing convenience does matter for some use cases without invalidating the core WiFi basis of what makes Sonos so great. The <strong>Era 100</strong> competes directly with Bose and Sony’s premium offerings while it currently sells for mid-range pricing that makes no sense given its capabilities. Amazon <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5807/">dropped this to $169 for Black Friday, down from $199, which is a record low</a> that puts exceptional audio within reach of anyone looking for Bluetooth speakers.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5807/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>47% Faster Processor Powers Dual-Tweeter Architecture</h2>
<p>The next-generation processor handles more complex audio processing in real time and enables features that previous Sonos speakers couldn’t support. Dual tweeters create genuine stereo separation from a single speaker, placing instruments and vocals in distinct left and right positions. This architecture produces a soundstage that fills rooms rather than feeling like sound emanates from a single point. The <strong>25% larger midwoofer extends bass response deeper than the previous generation</strong>, and gives kick drums and bass lines actual impact without needing a separate subwoofer for most music.</p>
<p>This compact design fits easily on bookshelves, kitchen counters, desks and nightstands. You place the speaker wherever you really spend time, rather than arranging furniture around audio equipment. <strong>The size makes it truly portable inside your home</strong>&nbsp;and moves from room to room as the day progresses with you. It weighs enough to feel substantial yet remains light enough to carry easily in one hand.</p>



<p>Wi-Fi streaming provides lossless audio quality from the likes of Spotify, Apple Music, Tidal, and Amazon Music. The connection also remains stable throughout a home without the dropouts that plague Bluetooth in larger spaces. You control playback through the Sonos app which aggregates all of your streaming services into one interface. AirPlay 2 support adds another streaming option for Apple users who want to send audio directly from their devices.</p>
<p><strong>Bluetooth connectivity handles quick pairing with phones</strong>, tablets, and laptops when you want simple wireless playback. You press a button on the back of the speaker, and instantly, your device finds it. This mode is great for playing podcasts, audiobooks, or music from apps that aren’t integrated into the Sonos ecosystem. The implementation of Bluetooth maintains decent quality, though Wi-Fi streaming sounds noticeably better when that option is available.</p>
<p>The Line-In Adapter includes <strong>a 3.5mm auxiliary input to connect turntables</strong>, CD players, or other analog sources. This adapter is available separately but turns the Era 100 into a powered speaker for vinyl setups or legacy audio equipment. It combines digital streaming with analog input flexibility that pure Bluetooth speakers simply can’t compete with.</p>



<p>Trueplay tuning uses your iPhone’s microphone to <strong>analyze room acoustics and then automatically adjust the speaker’s EQ</strong>. You wave your phone around the listening area for about a minute, and it makes a custom sound profile optimized for your particular space. This calibration compensates for room characteristics, such as hard surfaces that create reflections or soft furnishings that absorb sound. The difference between tuned and untuned sound is immediately noticeable, with vocals becoming clearer and bass tightening up.</p>
<p><strong>Alexa integration enables voice control</strong> for music playback, smart home commands, and general queries. The built-in microphones pick up voice commands clearly even when music plays at moderate volumes. You can add the Era 100 to multi-room setups with other Sonos speakers, creating a whole-home audio system that plays synchronized music everywhere or different content in each room. This ecosystem approach means starting with one speaker and expanding over time as budget allows.</p>
<p>For $169, you’re getting Sonos premium audio engineering, with both WiFi and Bluetooth for less than mid-range speakers elsewhere that can’t compete on sound quality. Similarly priced Bose and Sony speakers rely exclusively on Bluetooth and don’t have the multi-room capabilities that make Sonos special.</p>

                <p>For years, Sony focused almost exclusively on releasing its games for PlayStation platforms, and while the company's focus remains in the console market, it has expanded to PC in recent years. A new report says Sony is having plenty of success with these efforts, with its PC releases thus far collectively bringing in more than $1.2 billion in revenue.</p><p>A <a href="https://alineaanalytics.substack.com/p/the-top-selling-playstation-games" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">report from Alinea Analytics</a> put forth this number, based on its own research. The best-selling PlayStation game on PC is Helldivers 2, the report said, selling more than 12.7 million copies.</p><p>In total, the report said Sony's five top-selling PC releases on Steam have passed 43 million copies sold collectively. The gross revenue from these sales reportedly amounted to $1.5 billion. This includes $1.2 billion for Sony and Valve's cut of $350 million or more. Valve takes a 30% cut of PC game sales on Steam, falling to 25% after $10 million in revenue and $20% after 50 million.</p><p>The report added that Helldivers 2 players are seriously engaged with the game, with a reported one-fifth of players logging more than 100 hours total. More than 200,000 people who own the game on Steam play it every day, the report said.</p><h2><strong>PlayStation's top-selling PC games on Steam</strong></h2><ul><li>Helldivers 2 -- 12.7 million</li><li>Horizon: Zero Dawn -- 4.5 million</li><li>God of War -- 4.2 million</li><li>Days Gone -- 3.4 million</li><li>Marvel's Spider-Man -- 2.7 million</li></ul><p>While Sony is obviously enjoying success with its PC releases, the report said there are signs that show interest in PlayStation games on PC may be slowing down.</p><p>"All of Sony's major franchises have already landed on PC. The audience that was once excited to experience these games for the first time has largely been served. Later releases naturally face smaller potential audiences, and our estimates clearly show this," the report said.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4608722-helldivers2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4608722" data-ratio="0.57978723404255" data-width="1128" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4608722-helldivers2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4608722"></a><figcaption>Helldivers 2.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4608722-helldivers2.jpg"></figure><p>Looking ahead, Alinea said the challenge PlayStation faces is landing on the right window for PC releases that "protects PS5 software sales while still satisfying a PC audience that increasingly expects timely releases."</p><p>Sony does not have any strict schedules for when a PlayStation game may come to PC, except for the company's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-boss-reveals-why-sony-doesnt-release-most-ps5-games-on-pc-day-and-date/1100-6523804/" data-ref-id="1100-6523804">commitment to launch live-service games simultaneously for console and PC. </a>The company's marquee first-party PS5 games will not come to PC for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-wont-bring-first-party-titles-to-pc-for-at-least-a-year-except-live-service/1100-6508026/" data-ref-id="1100-6508026">at least a year</a> after they originally debut on console.</p><p>PlayStation boss Hermen Hulst said Sony doesn't release those games day-and-date across console and PC as part of an effort to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-boss-reveals-why-sony-doesnt-release-most-ps5-games-on-pc-day-and-date/1100-6523804/" data-ref-id="1100-6523804">protect the PlayStation console ecosystem</a>. "Our single-player, narrative-driven titles that are the backbone of what PlayStation Studios has delivered in recent years and in our history--we take a more strategic approach," he said.</p><p>The Alinea report also raised the question of if Sony might look to shift its strategy in response to the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/steam-machine-release-date-price-everything-we-know/1100-6536286/" data-ref-id="1100-6536286">Steam Machine</a> launch in 2026. The console-like six-inch cube PC could shake things up.</p><p>"If Steam begins to function as a competing ecosystem with its own dedicated hardware that plays PlayStation titles, the relationship changes," Alinea's Rhys Elliott said. "PlayStation may soon face pressure to rethink its timing and release strategy as Steam evolves from a distribution platform into a rival platform with broader reach and fewer constraints."</p><p>Microsoft has been embracing PC releases for a long time already, and the company has indicated that its next Xbox platform <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-president-says-hardware-is-core-to-the-xbox-ecosystem/1100-6536289/" data-ref-id="1100-6536289">could embrace more PC sensibilities</a>. The other big platform-holder, Nintendo, does not release any games on PC.</p><p>Strauss Zelnick, the head of Rockstar owner Take-Two, recently made headlines when he said the gaming industry is "moving towards PC."</p><p>"I think it's moving towards PC and business is moving towards open rather than closed," Zelnick told <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/11/17/take-two-ceo-gaming-consoles-pc.html" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">CNBC</a>. "But if you define console as the property, not the system, then the notion of a very rich game that you engage in for many hours that you play on a big screen--that's never going away."</p>

			<p>Mount and Blade II: Bannerlord is now more than three years removed from its 1.0 release in October 2022 (and <a href="https://wccftech.com/mount-blade-ii-bannerlord-early-access-preview/">five years removed from its early access launch</a>), and developer TaleWorlds Entertainment <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-mount-and-blade-ii-bannerlord-war-sails-gameplay-trailer/">is set to release the game's biggest expansion so far.</a> War Sails adds naval combat to the game for the first time, brings back a beloved faction with the return of the Nords from the original Mount and Blade, adds a whole new biome to explore, new skills for players to master, and a slew of tweaks and changes to the base game with a free update.</p>



<p>Ahead of its launch, I got the chance to play some of the coming expansion and hear from the developers about everything coming in War Sails. I also got the chance to speak to Falk Engel, senior producer at TaleWorlds Entertainment on Mount and Blade II: Bannerlord and Gökçen Karaağaç, the team lead on the game's design team.</p>

</p></figure>



<p><strong>Firstly, I'd like to hear about the key upgrades to ship combat in War Sails, and the impact it has on the rest of the game.</strong></p>



<p><strong>Gökçen Karaağaç</strong>: <em>I mean, the biggest, I guess, would be the ram [ramming ships] and the balistas, because they kind of open up new ways of ship destruction</em>, <em>but the primary method of ship destruction, as you can see in the gameplay, is fire. The other things that end up being more impactful are the campaign upgrades that get you to carry more troops or for your troops to have higher morale or your ship having a higher sea burton so you can handle the storms or simply travel faster, those upgrades end up having a bigger impact on your gameplay overall.</em> <em>Also, the other note to that is not all ships have access to all upgrades. Some ships are more customizable or more all-rounder ships, while others are more purpose-built. They make up for that [lack of customization] by being really specialized ships. They are really good at what they try to do.</em></p>



<p><strong>Falk Engel:</strong> <em>To add to that, there's also the option to increase your cargo holds, so that you can be more oriented in your upgrades towards travel and trade or more combat oriented.</em></p>



<p><strong>Is it possible to do coordinated land and sea attacks from two different armies?</strong></p>



<p><strong></strong><strong>Gökçen Karaağaç</strong>: <em>Not in the way you're asking, no.</em> <em>We don't have a hybrid combat system, where you can have some troops at sea</em> <em>and some troops at land interact, but we do have methods to land in the naval</em>, <em>especially when you are trying to conquer towns, especially coastal towns, you need to be ready for both naval and land battles, as the defenders might attack you on both sides, so there is that, but no hybrid missions.</em></p>



<p><strong>Falk Engel: </strong><em>In terms of the campaign side of this, there is no way for you to directly tell another party or army to go somewhere and do something at that exact moment, but of course, as a player, you have the ability to observe what the other army is doing, and then coordinate with that action</em>. </p>



<p><strong>Will the skills of troops affect the ship that they're on during combat or is it only the captain's skill that matters?</strong></p>



<p><strong></strong><strong>Gökçen Karaağaç</strong>: <em>It's only the captain's skill that matters;</em> troops use their own skills. Apart from if they are a Mariner or not,<em> if they are not, they kind of get hampered in their combat abilities, but their skills do not affect the ship's stats or abilities</em>.</p>



<p><strong>The three new skills that are being added, Mariner, Boatswain, and Shipmaster, are those replacing the old skills, or do players get an additional attribute?</strong></p>



<p><strong></strong><strong>Gökçen Karaağaç</strong>: <em>You don't get additional attributes, but each of the skills kind of corresponds to two different attributes. I'm not certain at the moment, but it's like Vigor and Control is the Mariner, for example. Previously, each attribute, each skill was combined to a single attribute, but these new naval skills are touching two of the other ones. So, if you're already a good tactician and a decent warrior, if you use those attributes, you will be a good Mariner anyway. Not right away, but it will be easy for you to be a good Mariner.</em></p>



<p><strong>What does the new Nord faction add to the game? Why did you want to bring the Nords back in?</strong></p>



<p><strong></strong><strong>Gökçen Karaağaç</strong>: <em>I mean, there's definitely nostalgia. It is one of those factions, as a culture, that's easy to justify</em> <em>coming in. 'Oh, they were always up there, and now they've started to pick up their ships and come here.' So, story-wise it makes more sense</em> <em>to bring them back. That is one part of it; the other one is what they are bringing to the table, land battle-wise. They also give us room and reason to put more effort into infantry combat. They are bringing the heaviest and highest-tier level</em> <em>infantry in the game</em>, <em>which kind of crushes through almost every infantry, and whatever it can't crush it trades quite well into. Beyond that, of course, whatever the other factions get naval-wise, Nords can do it better, in almost every aspect. Except trade, they're kind of okay-ish in that one, so that's their gimmick.</em></p>



<p><strong>Falk Engel:</strong> <em>Aside from this - trade is a nice keyword - they do produce some trade items that you can engage with. When you go to their lands, they'll have different environments, biomes, architecture, etc. So there's just more to explore; they look quite interesting. When you go into their towns, you'll see that their housing is inspired by ships. They have this kind of unique layout on the map, where there's Nordvik, the large portion that is kind of interacting down with Sturgia, and then you have towards Vineland, this island area, where there's another town, and that's not something that we had before.</em></p>



<p><strong></strong><strong>Gökçen Karaağaç</strong>: <em>One unique aspect to them is that they're a lot less town-focused, but they have a lot more castles, so they have like four well-supplied towns, but most of their lords are just ruling over castles, so their economy is a bit more military focused in a sense and less...not as powerful as Aserai for example, but also not as fragile. They have a more safe economy, compared to other factions</em>.</p>



<p><strong>Will the politics of the game get any big changes with this new expansion?</strong></p>



<p><strong></strong><strong>Gökçen Karaağaç</strong>: <em>We already introduced some in the Beta branch and in the base game update, and we are going to improve upon it. We're going to improve on the alliances and how we conduct them, but inner kingdom-wise, there are new policies that are both naval-related, for the base game as well, that inspire some</em> <em>different roleplaying opportunities as well as some new strategies</em>.</p>



<p><strong>Falk Engel:</strong> <em>And maybe even beyond this, I mean, war is an extension of politics</em>. <em>The design team, Gökçen</em> <em>and others, have spent quite a bit of effort on improving the way in which factions consider wars, whether they're making progress, if this war is sensible,</em> <em>distance, the exposure in terms of the settlements and so forth, so even if that's not an outright addition, it changes the politics.</em></p>



<p><strong>While this expansion and naval combat are single-player only,</strong> <strong>there's also a big update releasing alongside War Sails for all players. Are there any multiplayer improvements coming in this new update?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Falk Engel: </strong><em>There are some improvements that are included, they are not the focus, and I think we should be clear on that to not mislead anyone.</em> <em>You've seen, as part of the beta, significant visual improvements that we've done through the atmosphere, and I think that's something that we're looking to take to the multiplayer as well. We're also looking at potentially including a new multiplayer team. With regards to what the future holds, that's something we're not discussing at the moment.</em></p>



<p><strong>So, no word on future DLC plans beyond War Sails?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Falk Engel:</strong> <em>Yes, that as well. Essentially, our approach tends to be that we want to be very sure about what we're doing before we bring it to players, because we don't see the benefit in creating false hope.</em></p>



<p><strong>Is cross-play functionality potentially on the horizon for Mount and Blade II: Bannerlord?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Falk Engel:</strong> <em>I don't want to say something wrong, I mean, I think I can say that there's no active work on that right now. We have to consider some aspects of it, like there are some aspects of it that are internal, the challenges associated with such a change. But there's also just the simple, 'would it actually add to the player experience to have cross-play</em>,' <em>'is it fun to play the game on controller versus someone who's on a mouse and keyboard.</em> <em>Especially with our multiplayer community, which is extremely, I mean, - </em></p>



<p><strong>Gökçen Karaağaç</strong>: <em>Dedicated [laughs]</em></p>



<p><strong>Falk Engel: </strong><em>Dedicated, yeah [laughs], I mean, I can't beat them. I don't think I would do better with a controller.</em></p>



<p><strong>I noticed in the notes about the big update coming for all players alongside War Sails' release includes "<em>expanded modding capabilities," </em>can you go into what that means? Is there anything modders should look out for in this update?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Falk Engel:</strong> <em>There is a long list of things <a href="https://forums.taleworlds.com/index.php?threads/e1-6-0-v1-3-1-modding-changes.443896/">that are part of the patch notes</a></em>. <em>I think one of the most buzzword-y things related to modding is the ability to crouch and use weapons at the same time. You know, anything with muskets, those kinds of mods, [modders] are really excited about, and I think are already interacting with as part of the beta. The [live] release itself, I don't think we'll see substantial additions there because we've already shared the vast majority of what we have done in the beta. Our modding community tends to engage with that early on so that their mods are ready when we push it live. When it comes to War Sails in and of itself, of course the support for naval gameplay, for pathfinding across the sea on the world map, for using ships. I think there are probably already some mods that have some level of seafaring, but if they have an interest in the DLC, I think that will both expand the capabilities that they have in that regard, as well as the existing content that they can co-opt or utilize in their mods as well.</em></p>



<p><strong>Gökçen Karaağaç</strong>: <em>Part of this effort on our end for modding capabilities is kind of to compensate for the changes coming into the base game. For example, even the way the water is rendered is changed, and we want to make sure that it is an easy effort for people who make their own world map to switch to the new system. So, some of these efforts also coincide with the new work we are kind of creating for our modders, to build up and continue supporting their creations.</em></p>



<p><strong>Is there still work being done on the Claimants that were shown a few years ago?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Falk Engel: </strong><em>So, we can't comment on the Claimants themselves at this point, but we can maybe say that there are some features that relate to them that we are still working on. I think we might have mentioned some of them previously. They do relate to other topics people care about such as making trades</em> <em>or valuables, but we don't want to talk about features that may still take quite a bit of time, because the moment that we make them more tangible, people tend to get very excited and then potentially very disappointed that it takes that amount of time before they get the answers.</em></p>



<p><strong>Is support for DLSS Frame Generation still on its way?</strong> <strong>Can you provide an update on when it might arrive?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Falk Engel: </strong><em>I can't give you an update now, I will check with the engine team and get back to you.</em></p>



<p><strong>Switching to consoles, are there any plans to take advantage of the more powerful hardware in PS5 Pro?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Falk Engel:</strong> <em>We don't have anything specific to mention on that currently. We can say, of course, that the work on the DLC has seen a lot of optimization in terms of memory, in terms of performance and so forth, which will also benefit consoles, both in the base game as well as the DLC.</em></p>



<p><strong>Do you have anything else you'd like to say to the community?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Falk Engel:</strong> <em>As always, our heartfelt gratitude for the long journey we've walked together and the support that people have given us over the years. It's awesome to see that people are still very excited. Personally, I come from the community, so it's always kind of fun to still have that engagement for a lot of our developers. It's great to see people talk about the DLC, talk about the game, give us feedback, and share their excitement for what's coming, and it will be very cool to see how they enjoy the DLC.</em></p>



<p><strong>Gökçen Karaağaç</strong>: <em>Have fun, enjoy the game, do not sail a ship that you can't afford to lose.</em></p>



<p><strong>Thank you so much for your time.</strong></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>There’s no shortage of laptops in the market, but not every powerful laptop is a gaming laptop. Standard laptops (made for everyday work and casual use) prioritize features like battery life, decent display, and lower costs. Gaming machines, on the other hand, pack high-performance components that can let you game and work on creative projects without slowing down. These options typically have stronger dedicated GPUs and CPUs, faster RAMs, and a bigger storage capacity, but as you’d expect, they can cost a pretty penny.</p>
<p>Most solid options out there with all this and more sit well over $1,500, but that changes today. Amazon has kick-started its Black Friday and Cyber Monday celebrations already with some impressive early deals across a range of categories.<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5798/"> As part of that, the retailer has also dropped the price of the 16-inch ASUS TUF gaming laptop by 32%.</a> On a regular day, it would run you around $1,100, but you can snap it up for just $750 today. Honestly, that’s what most entry-level machines cost nowadays, which makes this offer no less than a steal. Of course, the stock is selling out fast, so there’s not much time left to save. If you have been wanting to upgrade your gaming experience for less, today is the day to make the move. In fact, this laptop can also be a great Christmas gift for a player in your life!</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5798/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Powerful GPU, Immersive Visuals</h2>
<p>There’s nothing too crazy going on with the design. The laptop looks and feels sturdy, plus comes with a subtle embossed TUF logo on its cover. The brand has thoroughly tested it to meet Military Grade testing standards, so you can expect it to handle everyday wear and tear well. Harsh conditions such as extreme temperatures, high humidity, and dirt won’t affect its performance one bit. But despite the sturdy, don’t-mess-with-me build, it’s lightweight enough to carry around easily. Take it to your office, nearby cafe, and even on some adventures without a worry.</p>
<p>Open it up and you’re greeted with a 16-inch Full HD display, which pushes immersive, detailed visuals. The 90% screen-to-body ratio gives you plenty of space to work and play. Color accuracy is excellent in all lighting conditions, making the content appear lifelike. The display also supports a 144Hz refresh rate to keep everything running smoothly, while the Adaptive-Sync technology actively reduces lag and minimizes stuttering for ultra-smooth gameplay.</p>



<p>Power is handled by an Intel Core i5 210H processor that’s paired with the underrated NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4050. The GPU offers a significant performance boost over its predecessor and is a great entry-level option for those on a budget. Then there’s a modest 16GB RAM for increased efficiency. It’s not massive, but does a good job of handling everyday multitasking and most modern titles without throwing a fit. You will also be able to store all your favorite games and creative programs without feeling limited, thanks to the massive 512GB PCIe Gen4 SSD. And since SSDs offer much faster system boot and load times, you won’t have to wait long to get on with your day.</p>
<p>Best of all, despite powerful performance, the laptop does not overheat. ASUS has packed it with Arc Flow Fans, 4 exhaust vents, 5 dedicated heat pipes, and an anti-dust filter; all of which come together to keep things cool and quiet in the background as you teach some bad guys a lesson. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5798/">There’s a lot more to like about this laptop, especially now that it’s going for just $750. The discount won’t be around forever, so it’s best to get your orders in fast.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>It appears that the launch of Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 hasn’t been one to write home about for Microsoft and Activision. According to a new report from The Game Business, Black Ops 7 sales numbers are down compared to both Battlefield 6 and last year’s Call of Duty: Black Ops 6.</p>



<p>In data <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-european" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">provided to the outlet</a> by GSD, Black Ops 7 sales—both physical and digital—are down 63% compared to Battlefield 6. Obviously, it’s important to note that Battlefield 6 isn’t available on any subscription service, meaning that people need to buy the game if they want to play. So, while the sales numbers for Battlefield 6 are higher, it’s still probably that the overall player count for Call of Duty is actually higher.</p>







<h2 id="h-sales-are-down-compared-to-last-year">Sales Are Down Compared To Last Year</h2>



<p>Where things get a little dicey is when you look at the comparison to last year’s release, Black Ops 6. According to the report, physical and digital sales are down over 50% compared to last year. Again, many can, and will, point the game being available on Xbox Game Pass for Ultimate and PC subscribers. But so was Black Ops 6. </p>



<p>Despite all the numbers being down, Black Ops 7 was still the best-selling game in terms of units and revenue in Europe for the week ending November 16 (its launch week). Battlefield 6, it’s main competition right now, came in fourth in both units sold and overall revenue.</p>







<p>At the end of the day, it’s not like Call of Duty is a dwindling franchise as it’s still generating revenue for its developers and publishers. Still, it’s interesting to see how far sales have fallen and if it’s simply a case of more people playing on Xbox Game Pass, or is there a real drop off in actual interest in the 22-year-old franchise.</p>

<figure data-uuid="3d4f11506dc58"><a title="Review: iMP Gaming Mini Arcade Pro 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/3d4f11506dc58/review-imp-gaming-mini-arcade-pro-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Damien McFerran / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>While we've all become accustomed to using fancy analogue controllers these days, there's still a large sector of the market which loves a good, old-fashioned eight-way digital arcade experience – and to that end, accessory company iMP has produced the Gaming Mini Arcade Pro for Switch and Switch 2.</p>
<p>On the surface, this looks like a bartop arcade cabinet, but in reality, it's a cradle for your Switch console that allows you to use authentic arcade-style controls with games that benefit from digital input – such as old-school titles, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/best-nintendo-switch-shmups">shmups</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/best-nintendo-switch-fighting-games">fighting games</a>.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytC1rrCdi_XjA" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067htjsgl&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>839k</span></a></p>

<p>The iMP Gaming Mini Arcade Pro doesn't come preassembled, but putting it together (and taking it apart) is a straightforward process. Two caddy sections are included, one for the original Switch / Switch OLED, and one for the Switch 2.</p>

<p>Ensuring compatibility with both generations is a nice touch, but this really feels like it was designed for the newer variant; the cut-out for the screen is designed with Switch 2's larger display in mind, so the original Switch ends up looking like a toddler in a teenager's clothing.</p>
<p>The good news is that the Mini Arcade Pro's arcade-style controls are excellent regardless of which system you own. The clicky stick and buttons are smaller than you'd find on your typical bartop arcade cabinet, but they're a joy to use; within moments of booting up <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/street-fighter-6-years-1-2-fighters-edition">Street Fighter 6</a>, I was pulling off special moves with the minimum of effort.</p>
<p>Shmups also benefit massively from this accessory — <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/r-type_delta_hd_boosted">R-Type Delta: HD Boosted</a> is a particular joy to play — and I also enjoyed romping my way through <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/absolum">Absolum</a>.</p>
<figure data-uuid="a85ebc9a58b26"><a title="Review: iMP Gaming Mini Arcade Pro 1" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/a85ebc9a58b26/review-imp-gaming-mini-arcade-pro-1.large.jpg"></a><figcaption>There's space on the rear of the unit for 12 Switch Game Cards and 12(!) MicroSD cards — <em><span></span> Image: Damien McFerran / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>The central panel has all of the usual inputs (including a Home button which wakes your console from its sleep mode), as well as a switch which allows you to toggle the functionality of the stick – you can choose between the D-pad, left analogue stick, and right analogue stick. There's a 'C' button to bring up GameChat, but no 'Capture' button, oddly.</p>
<p>Spin it around, and there's space for you to clip in 12 Switch game cards and 12 MicroSD cards – a nice touch if you want to keep your software close at hand. My only reservation with this system is that the Game Card slots don't seem to grip all that well, and it doesn't take much to knock them out of the slots by accident.</p>
<p>My other major issue with the iMP Gaming Mini Arcade Pro is the artwork that has been printed onto the marquee, side panels, and the main control panel. The lettering is a <em>little</em> too childish for my liking, and while I'm not entirely sure, I think I detect the use of Generative AI to create the art itself. This obviously has no impact on the controller's performance, but it makes it look a little cheap, in my opinion.</p>

<p>The Switch's recent <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/poll-is-your-third-party-switch-2-dock-still-working-after-this-weeks-system-update">firmware update</a> actually broke the Mini Arcade Pro's ability to wake the console via the Home button and the functionality of the 'C' button, but, in a move which hopefully shows how committed the manufacturer is to making this device a success, it has <a href="https://impgaming.uk/v21/">received a firmware update</a> to fix the problem.</p>
<p>While I think the iMP Gaming Mini Arcade Pro's cheap-looking artwork counts against it, I can't fault the controller when it comes to delivering that old-school arcade experience. At £45, it's not likely to break the bank, either (although it's $90 in the US).</p>

			<div><header>Game Info</header><div><div>
						<h5>ARC Raiders</h5><p><span>October 30th, 2025</span>
					</p></div><div>
							<h5>Platform</h5><p><span>PlayStation 5, Xbox Series S|X, PC</span>
						</p></div></div></div>			
			<p>Get in, get loot, get out, and don't get shot. Those are the core tenets that extraction shooters live and die by. If the gameplay loop is solid and you can bring along friends for the journey, that's a recipe for success. Embark Studios is no stranger to unique takes on familiar competitive genres, with The Finals having been released nearly two years prior. The team is back with a new spin on the extraction shooter genre, one where antagonistic and automated robots have taken over the landscape, and players can only survive above ground for thirty minutes at a time before an unstoppable threat rolls in. This is ARC Raiders.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Few extraction shooters have frustrated me in the same way as ARC Raiders, and perhaps that can be a testament to its distinctive yet disruptive nature in the market. Dying on a run results in losing everything you brought with you, minus the one or two items you might have squirreled away in your prison pocket; the safe space is determined by whichever combat augment you've equipped. The poverty loadout that players can opt to start a run with doesn't have the luxury, so you're at the mercy of other players and ARC bots not to put a bullet in your back as you're trying to extract from the surface safely.</p>



<p>Another downside to jumping into the free loadout is the poor quality of the starting weapons. Of the variety of cheap beginner weapons, only the Ferro (single-shot rifle) and Stitcher (short-range SMG) felt like they were enough to keep me alive in a firefight, while the others felt like the developers were trolling me with how ineffective they could be. With these loadouts, you get one stack of ammo for your weapon, bandages, and one shield recharger. If you survive and make it back home, you can cash in that freebie for a proper augment with a safe pocket, although you might want to sell the gun and craft something more useful.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>ARC Raiders' gunplay remains what could be the tipping point for whether it draws in or turns players away. Again, the beginner rank weapons are such a handicap when going out to scavenge, and it isn't until the next tier of weapons that players might actually find a gun that's enjoyable to use (unless you feel like using the ammo-sink Kettle). Once I could craft the Anvil pistol or Il Toro shotgun, those remained a part of my loadout whenever I felt like actually hunting down bots (and players) and not just being a sneaky scav using the free loadout to loot and scoot.</p>



<p>Compared to the armored shells on the ARC enemies scattered about, raiders themselves feel like they're wearing paper rather than a shield meant to take a hit. Getting ambushed by one of the small rolling Pops can completely shred through the basic shield and take a player down to half health. Many of the flying ARC bots can also harass and chase down players just trying to escape with a modest collection of loot.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>The ARC is supposed to be the main threat, not the players, but that doesn't always hold true. Players should be wary any time they hear the sound of a nearby raider trying to breach and search a locked container or the telltale sounds of gunfire that might be closer than expected. Run into another player and you're at the mercy of their temperament and whether they even consider you a threat. If you're not a fan of hopping on voice chat and announcing your presence, there's a handy emote wheel where a callout asking the other player not to shoot will be one of the most commonly used phrases during your entire time playing through ARC Raiders. Of course, just because someone declares a truce doesn't prevent them from putting two in your back when you least expect it. Throughout most of my runs, the ones that ended in deadly gunfights were in squads of three; playing solo usually resulted in playing with like-minded players who just wanted to explore or complete the quests they had in their log.</p>



<p>To incentivize players to want to go topside into Toledo, there's a plethora of loot to fill your pockets with of various rarities, not all of which is simply fodder to recycle into base materials or sell for a little extra pocket change. Part of the problem is knowing exactly what is worth taking back and when. Depending on where you are in developing/upgrading the various crafting stations, you might need to seek out and gather different parts. A random cat bed you come across might not seem like much now, but it is one of the crucial components you'll need to bestow upon your rooster companion so that they can passively gather raw materials on your behalf. Each potential upgrade or craftable can be added to your wishlist, so I've tended to include every single crafting station and the usual assortment of Anvil handgun, tier 2 shields and loadouts, and other items I try to bring with me on every run of ARC Raiders so that if I find these materials out in the wild, I'll know to stash those away and save any extra pocket space for rare blueprints or other garbage I can simply sell to expand my storage chest back home.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>As I was writing this, I wanted to wait until Stella Montis opened up for players as the latest zone to explore and bring the roster of explorable locales up to five. Embark Studios has had to make some emergency updates and nerf a particular skill at the end of one skill tree, which allowed players to breach and loot security lockers for rare gear (it's since been toned down to reduce the typical rarity of scrap discovered). Stella Montis is a massive enclosed complex with a variety of ARC threats (some unique to the map as well) scattered throughout, but players should also be wary of other players because I've routinely found myself with a bullet to the back after greeting and passing by a fellow raider.</p>



<p>After a brief introductory tutorial mission that results in the player getting shot in the back, the few remnants of the story left to ARC Raiders are told by way of quests and brief interactions with NPCs who never leave their respective shops. If you're looking for some grand story about why the world is constantly besieged by the ARC threat, you'll be left out in the cold. These NPCs also speak with an inhuman, robotic tone that expresses itself with inflections at unnatural times and a cadence that doesn't match what an actual human actor would portray. This is because of Embark Studios' usage of generative AI for these NPC interactions and perhaps all of the vocal callouts out in the world as well. While the NPCs might have been trained off of real human actors, it nevertheless mars what would otherwise be a really solid audio presentation. </p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Audio is also one of the highlights of ARC Raiders that should get recognized all on its own, minus the aforementioned disgust with the generative AI vocals above. Each weapon sounds distinctively different from afar, and each threat or point of interest has its own audible hum or trill that the player will instinctively pick up over time. Pick up the subtle clicking of a clock off somewhere unseen? The 3D audio on PlayStation 5 will help guide you to its exact location as you turn and run towards a buried raider cache full of useful loot. Sometimes I can even tell what sort of ARC threat I'm about to encounter topside just by the mechanical sounds scattered throughout. The vocal callouts can be adjusted to be either a subtle or loud callout (or you can just leave it on automatic), depending on whether you want to alert any other players in the immediate vicinity to your discovery. The classic Don't Shoot callout will always be shouted out to prevent players from perhaps hearing the message before bullets start flying.</p>

<p>ARC Raiders is also a graphical powerhouse on PlayStation 5 Pro, leveraging the power of Unreal Engine 5 to great effect and better than other games that might use the standard UE5 featureset. It does target a solid 60 FPS and achieves it almost all of the time, thanks in part to a dynamic resolution scaling that Embark Studios themselves have confirmed as ranging between 720p and 2160p on the PlayStation 5 Pro to help sustain that 60 FPS target. Below is a little bit of what players should anticipate for performance:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>PS5: Scalability settings</strong>&nbsp;– High Quality; Dynamic Resolution range – 720p-1600p</li>



<li><strong>PS5 Pro: Scalability settings</strong>&nbsp;– Epic Quality; Dynamic Resolution range – 720p-2160p
<ul>
<li>Scalability settings affect rendering quality in aspects such as Global Illumination, Shadows, Reflections, Post Processing, Texture resolution and filtering, VFX, View Distance, etc.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>



<p>All in all, ARC Raiders is a phenomenal entry in the growing loot-and-scoot genre, or extraction shooter if you want to be more technical about it. While the gunplay suffers in the early stages with inferior tier one weaponry, it shines through once you start developing squad tactics and learn the ins and outs of besting the array of lethal ARC threats throughout Toledo. I wanted to wait until the first major content push from Embark Studios before finalizing my thoughts, and the inclusion of Stella Montis has brought a new flavor of psychological warfare to escalate this extraction shooter to greater heights.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>A Game About Digging a Hole</em>, which is a game about, er, navigating a tricky post-colonial climate, is making its way to consoles next month, developer DoubleBee and publisher rokaplay have announced.</p>

<p>The game, which has been available on PC since February, will be launching on current-gen machines (and Nintendo Switch, although not the Switch 2, apparently) on December 9th.</p>

<p>If you're wondering why <i>A Game About Digging a Hole&nbsp;</i>is getting a console release, it's probably because the indie hit managed to rack up 250,000 sales <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/a-game-about-digging-a-hole-sales-250k" rel="nofollow">inside its first week</a>, so it stands to reason DoubleBee and rokaplay would want to expand its audience.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/a-game-about-digging-a-hole-console-pit.jpg?itok=-60Hu0ZV 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/a-game-about-digging-a-hole-console-pit.jpg?itok=ogsfsPov 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>A Game About Digging a Hole&nbsp;</em>is coming to consoles soon.</figcaption></figure><p>Since then, rokaplay says&nbsp;<em>A Game About Digging a Hole</em>'s audience has expanded to encapsulate more than 1.2 million players, describing it as an "unassuming indie title" that will be stepping "onto the biggest stages in gaming" next month.</p>

<p>If you're wondering what&nbsp;<em>A Game About Digging a Hole&nbsp;</em>is, well, it's a game about digging a hole, funnily enough. You have a spade, and you must dig a hole in your back garden, beneath which you'll find all manner of secrets and other things buried.</p>

<p>Over the course of your time digging your hole, you'll be able to upgrade your equipment and sell the resources you gather. As rokaplay and DoubleBee say, "there's no rush, no pressure, just the pure joy of discovery as you dig deeper and deeper".</p>

<p>That'll be reflected in&nbsp;<em>A Game About Digging a Hole</em>'s price point; the game retails for just $5 on PC, which, as the two studios point out, is "less than a takeaway coffee". Hopefully, the console price point will reflect that as well.</p>




<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>A Game About Digging a Hole&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3244220/A_Game_About_Digging_A_Hole/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC via Steam</a>, and it's launching on <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-gb/concept/10015382/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PS5</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/games/store/a-game-about-digging-a-hole/9NGLST31DG26" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/a-game-about-digging-a-hole-switch/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch</a> on December 9th.

            <link>https://kotaku.com/bring-party-home-with-the-beats-pill-speaker-for-just-100-ahead-of-black-friday-2000645859</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/apple-goes-hard-on-beats-pill-its-most-heavily-discounted-bluetooth-speaker-this-black-friday.1361056/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Good music can instantly lift your mood and bring life to gatherings. If you host often or like to enjoy your favorite tracks with a rich, room-filling sound, having a solid speaker is a must. The best ones out there offer a mix of portability, reliable battery life, and, of course, deep sound.</p>
<p>If you’re looking to grab such an option without paying the full price, we come bearing good news. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5797/">Thanks to an early Black Friday deal, the top-rated Beats Pill speaker, which typically goes for $150, is currently available for just $100.</a> That’s after a nice 33% discount, and it applies to all color options. Like your audio gear basic? Consider the black option. Need something a bit more cheerful? The red pill (quite literally) is going to look stunning! Note that this deal gets you just the speaker. If you’re looking to pair it with a handy USB-C charging cable, the bundle is going for $110 (down from $168); just ten bucks more.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5797/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>
<p>Both deals are open to both Prime and non-Prime members. There are no complicated steps to take care of to score the discount, either. We highly recommend jumping on the offer fast, as it could wrap up any moment now. Considering how this is one of the lowest prices we have seen the speaker drop to ever, we’re also not expecting it to stay in stock for long.</p>

<h2>Powerful, Room-Filling Sound</h2>
<p>The speaker is truly portable. It’s shaped like a pill and is quite lightweight. There’s a removable lanyard that makes it easy to carry around. Take it off when you want a cleaner look, or don’t want it to get the way during outdoor activities. The overall material is quite durable as well, meaning the Pill can handle everyday wear and tear like a champ.</p>
<p>When it comes to performance, Beats has packed the speaker with a bigger, bespoke racetrack woofer that can displace 90% more air volume to deliver fuller bass. The redesigned tweeter takes care of all the highs and lows in your favorite tracks to offer better clarity. Expect minimal distortion even when you are listening to songs at high volume. Vibing to the latest Taylor Swift song or trying to keep your child entertained with a lullaby, the Beats Pill fills the room with high-quality audio that pulls you in.</p>



<p>There’s also support for lossless audio, which you can enjoy by connecting your speaker to your laptop or other compatible devices via the USB-C cable. This mode retains all the data from the source recording to preserve full, original quality. It basically gets you higher-quality audio, so you can enjoy tracks to the fullest. Want an even bigger experience? Pair two of these together to listen in the Amplify mode or Stereo mode.</p>
<p>It’s IP67-rated for dust and water resistance. Take it to the beach or by the pool without a worry. And even though Beats is owned by Apple, the speaker plays nicely with both Apple and Android devices. Pairing literally takes a few minutes, and once you have it connected to your phone or laptop, you can even take calls directly through it!</p>
<p>A single charge gets you up to 24 hours of battery life, which is more than enough to get the party going all day and all night. Even better, it doubles as a power bank when needed. Plug your device in via USB-C cable and juice it up without stepping away from the dance floor.</p>
<p>All things considered, the Beats Pill speaker is a great option to consider if you’re looking for a powerful, yet portable Bluetooth speaker.<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5797/"> It’s now down to $100, which is basically nothing considering the features it packs.</a></p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/im-still-excited-for-half-life-3-and-you-should-be-too-2000646204</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/i%E2%80%99m-still-excited-for-half-life-3-and-you-should-be-too.1361053/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>January 30, 2014. Over a decade ago now. I sat down and <a href="https://www.giantbomb.com/profile/halomaste19/blog/i-m-still-excited-for-half-life-3/104703/">wrote up a blog on my personal <em>Giant Bomb</em> account</a> about <em>Half-Life 3</em> and why, after seven years of waiting, I was still excited. Now, 17 years after the launch of<em> Half-Life 2: Episode</em> 2 and five years after <em>Half-Life Alyx,</em> I find myself still waiting for Valve to announce <em>Half-Life 3.</em> And while some might not care anymore or may even find it all tiring, I’m still excited, damn it.</p> <p>For the last few weeks, <a href="https://kotaku.com/half-life-3-timeline-hype-leaks-clues-explained-release-date-november-trailer-2000645448">hype has been building around <em>Half-Life 3</em></a>, despite Valve never announcing or even teasing it. Doesn’t matter. Since late 2021, something has been building in the community. <a href="https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVINqBTwM=/?moveToWidget=3458764648489439347&amp;cot=14">Dataminers have continued to extract and share pieces of code</a> from other Valve games that seem to indicate that the company is working on a new <em>Half-Life</em> game, reportedly codenamed HLX. Then, earlier this month, Valve announced <a href="https://kotaku.com/16-cool-details-valve-new-steam-machine-console-controller-vr-headset-2000643572">three (lol) new pieces of gaming hardware</a>, but didn’t announce a new game to go with any of it. That struck some as odd and got many wondering if that datamined <em>Half-Life</em> project was set to be a Steam Machine launch game in 2026.</p>

 <p>Sprinkle on to this situation some insiders teasing another big reveal, extra security being spotted at Valve during the hands-on with the new hardware, and what appears to be a new Valve game waiting to be revealed on Steam, and you end up with what we have now: A lot of people freaking out about <em>Half-Life 3</em> possibly being announced very soon. And you know what? I’m one of those people, and I think more people should be hyped.</p>

 <h2>Why you should care about <em>Half-Life 3</em></h2> <p><em>Half-Life 2: Episode 2′</em>s ending was an infamous cliffhanger that killed off a major character and raised the stakes in a big way. And for 13 years, that cliffhanger remained unchanged and had many <em>Half-Life</em> fans like me desperate to find out what happens next. We finally found out in <em>Half-Life: Alyx</em>, which is a VR prequel whose ending makes a big change to the cliffhanger, undoing that shocking death and replacing it with a mysterious new situation, one which only Gordon Freeman seems capable of solving. Five years later I’m still waiting, and I’m still super excited to see what happens next.</p>

 <p>The thought of Gordon Freeman and his iconic crowbar going after the G-Man and possibly wrapping up the storyline that started in<em> Half-Life</em> back in 1998 is a tantalizing one. This is a world and narrative I’ve thought about a lot for…well, most of my life. And the idea that it might finally be wrapping up in the near(ish) future has me bouncing off the walls. But maybe <em>you</em> don’t care about the world of <em>Half-Life.</em> That’s fair. There’s still plenty of reason to be excited to see what Valve does next.</p>

  <p>I’m really fascinated to see the next big video game from Valve. This is a studio with a nearly flawless track record that prides itself on creating incredible experiences that push technology and game design forward. And <em>Half-Life</em> is the studio’s flagship franchise. The thing that made everything else possible. So it makes sense that a lot of money, care, and time are being put into making HLX, or <em>Half-Life 3</em>, something very special.</p>

 <p><em>HLX</em> also, based on datamined leaks, will be the studio’s first non-VR, full-length single-player video game release since 2011’s <em>Portal 2</em>.&nbsp; Valve just hasn’t made a game like this in a long, long time, and that alone has me intrigued.</p>

 <p>What does a big AAA <em>Half-Life</em> sequel look like in 2025 or, more likely, 2026? Valve often uses the <em>Half-Life</em> franchise to push game technology forward while trying out new ideas like VR, HDR, advanced physics, and the gravity gun. What will be the cool new “thing” in <em>Half-Life 3</em>? Data mining points to some impressive-sounding simulation tech that can accurately recreate how wet an object is or how flammable a surface might be, which could lead to some wild puzzles. Or maybe it will make combat more dynamic?</p> <p>Until whatever game using this tech is <em>actually</em> released, we won’t know for sure how it will be used, but I have to imagine that the next <em>Half-Life</em> game from Valve won’t just be six or seven levels that play mostly like <em>Half-Life 2</em> but with a shiny coat of paint slapped on top. Valve isn’t that kind of studio. That’s now how they make games. And that has me really excited to see what the team has been cooking up for the last five years or so.</p> <h2>A big game not burdened by stockholders or trends</h2> <p>Another big reason to be excited: Unlike most other game studios and publishers, Valve answers to nobody. It has all the money it needs and can make whatever it wants, essentially. So <em>Half-Life 3</em> won’t need to include microtransactions, AI generation tools, battle passes, cosmetic stores, free-to-play elements, crossover content, ads, or anything else that most players find annoying. <em>Half-Life 3</em> doesn’t have to chase trends. <em>Half-Life 3</em> doesn’t have to be an extraction shooter because the publisher demands it. Instead, Valve can spend many years and a shit-ton of money building something it wants to make, and that sounds very refreshing.</p>

 <p>In a time when every game seems to be from one of three genres or is a remake, Valve’s next <em>Half-Life</em> sequel could be something very different. It could be a AAA, modern single-player action-shooter developed by one of the best studios around, with no strings attached and powered by advanced simulation tech. Yes please!</p> <p>While I’m fairly confident that Valve is working on a<em> Half-Life</em> game that might end up being <em>Half-Life 3<!--StartFragment --><span>—</span><!--EndFragment --></em>there’s just too much damn data out there to say otherwise<!--StartFragment --><span>—</span><!--EndFragment -->there’s no guarantee it will see the light of day anytime soon, or ever. Valve is a weird company that isn’t publicly traded and, as mentioned, has an infinite money machine called Steam funding its activities. It has no financial reason to release something unless it wants to, and it can take as long as it wants to make anything.</p> <p>So maybe <em>Half-Life 3</em> gets announced tomorrow. Maybe in 2026. Maybe years from now. Regardless, I’m still excited, and I think anyone who cares about games should be, too.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Twitch Added To Australia’s Social Media Ban]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/twitch-australia-social-media-ban/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/twitch-added-to-australia%E2%80%99s-social-media-ban.1361050/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Twitch is now the latest platform to be added to Australia’s upcoming social media ban. Just weeks after it was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/australia-to-ban-kick-and-reddit-for-children-under-16/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced that Kick</a> would be added, news has come out from Australian media about its main rival being put on the list as well.</p>



<p>First reported by the <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-11-21/twitch-included-in-under-16s-social-media-ban/106036398" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Australian Broadcasting Corporation (ABC)</a>, Twitch’s addition comes less than three weeks before the ban is set to go into effect. For those unfamiliar, the Australian government is enacting legislation that will ban anyone under the age of 16 from having accounts on a number of social media platforms. </p>







<p>Those platforms include TikTok, Snapchat, Twitter, Instagram, Threads, Facebook, YouTube, Kick, and, now, Twitch.</p>



<p><strong>“eSafety has informed Twitch it is considered an age-restricted social media platform required to take reasonable steps to prevent under 16s from having accounts, in accordance with Australia’s Social Media Minimum Age legislation,”</strong> a <a href="https://www.esafety.gov.au/newsroom/media-releases/twitch-assessed-as-age-restricted-social-media-platform" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">statement on Australia’s eSafety website reads</a>.<strong> “Following Twitch’s own self-assessment, eSafety assessed Twitch as meeting the criteria for ‘age-restricted social media platform’, because it has the sole or significant purpose of online social interaction with features designed to encourage user interaction, including through livestreaming content.”</strong></p>



<p>Starting December 10, Twitch will block the signups from those under 16 and will start deactivating the accounts of current users who aren’t old enough.</p>



<p>According to the office of Australian Communications Minister Anika Wells, there aren’t any more evaluations planned before December 10. That means that the platforms listed above will be the ones that must comply with the new order. That said, this ban is “dynamic”, and that more can be added, or removed, if it need be.</p>







<p>“Our historic law simply aims to provide Australian children with a reprieve from the persuasive pull of platforms,” a spokesperson told ABC. “We are not chasing perfection, we are chasing a meaningful difference in the lives of young Australians.”</p>



<p>What are your thoughts on the growing social media ban for those under 16 in Australia? Should the government really get involved like this, or should the platforms a kid uses be regulated by their parents and guardians?

<section><p>Pokemon Legends: Z-A might have found a new way to battle, but it likely won't inspire a larger competitive scene.</p></section>
        
        
                    
              <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p dir="ltr">To longtime fans, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/pokemon-legends-z-a-review-a-battle-revolution/1900-6418423/" data-ref-id="1900-6418423">Pokemon Legends: Z-A</a> represents the next evolution of a beloved franchise. Instead of using Pokemon's traditional turn-based combat, this new game embraces more frenetic, real-time combat. This approach feels bold and transformative, as it seems to reimagine Pokemon as a light action game. However, not all fans are on board with this decision, which breaks with the series' decades-long tradition of using turn-based combat in core console releases.</p><p dir="ltr">At times, it seems like the mainline Pokemon games struggle to innovate. Leadership at The Pokemon Company often relegate new gameplay experiences to neglected spin-off series or mobile games like Pokemon Mystery Dungeon or Pokemon Go. So getting what many fans see as a "mainline" console game with a new gameplay gimmick has been welcomed by fans begging the series to reinvent itself. However, new changes bring risks. Although Pokemon Legends: Z-A might have found a new way to battle, it still lacks the rigor of the mainline games and likely won't inspire a larger competitive scene around it, even if the bones are good.</p><p dir="ltr">The developers at Game Freak and The Pokemon Company have added several key features to Legends: Z-A that, on the surface, make the game seem streamlined for competitive play. Unlike its predecessor, Pokemon Legends: Arceus, Legends: Z-A allows players to battle online and progress up a ladder. These battles toss four trainers in a space together, in which they run around and fight each other. The more Pokemon you defeat, the more points you get, which ultimately elevates your trainer rank when the fight is done.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4608549-img_0603.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4608549" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4608549-img_0603.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4608549"></a><figcaption>A look at Pokemon Legends: Z-A's online multiplayer mode.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4608549-img_0603.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">This way of battling can result in chaotic and fun antics. Having four people run around all at once feels like a free for all with your friends. You can target someone who already has low health with a well-timed attack or switch at the right moment to avoid a big attack from an opponent. However, as good and fun this can be, it might not be enough to inspire a lasting competitive community around the game.</p><p dir="ltr">Among those who are more skeptical of this pivot is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/JoeUX9" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">JoeUX9</a>, a Pokémon coach and two-time regional champion. JoeUX9 explained why turn-based battles work better for the competitive scene than the gameplay in Legends: Z-A.</p><p dir="ltr">“[Turn-based battling] suits a one-vs-one, turn-based play style, where you can't ‘dodge’ attacks and it's more of a chess style of play. It leans more into the strategic and calculated style of Pokemon, whereas the battle royale ranked battles in ZA reward a reaction-based method where you aren't going through things turn by turn, but rather consistent action for four minutes.”</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@skrawvgc">Skraw</a>, a competitive Pokemon player and YouTuber, told GameSpot that he thinks the Legends: Z-A battle system could lead to a larger competitive scene, but not in its "current iteration."</p><p dir="ltr">"It has a lot of elements of a good real-time game," Skraw said. "For example, I think using switching and Mega evolution as a way to get immunity frames to dodge attacks feels very rewarding. But I think the way your agency sort of vanishes to pre-programmed pathing and jank would make it frustrating to play with any real stakes on the line. I'd say the system has good bones, but needs to be polished."</p><p dir="ltr">Key ways of strategizing present in the turn-based games, like using status effects, buffs, and debuffs to your advantage, are adapted in somewhat bizarre ways; oftentimes, their implementation feels awkward. In my own experience using the teams I have built based on recommendations online, it's better to wham on your opponents with the strongest and quickest attacks possible. You don't really need to think about setting up a larger strategy and often, that feels like cheesing. Additionally, key aspects of the turn-based games, like Pokemon abilities, aren't present in Legends: Z-A.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@TheUziGunner">TheUziGunner</a>, a competitive player and veteran of the Pokemon Draft League, told GameSpot that a solid battle system requires a "mix of strategy and creativity."</p><p dir="ltr">"Incentivisation for teambuilding and proper lines of sequence akin to chess and long-term planning which get rewarded with the battle system," TheUziGunner said. "That is what best works for the existing turn-based combat players including myself as there is nothing more satisfying in seeing a substantial payoff in having hours of serious effort pertaining to teambuilding and paying off through outplaying our opponent. If these aspects can be retained in real-time combat, then I absolutely see it cultivating a serious competitive scene!"</p><p dir="ltr">He told GameSpot he appreciates certain aspects of battling, like positioning and cooldowns for certain moves, but this way of battling can still feel unbalanced at points.</p><p dir="ltr">""It still feels rather unbalanced as you can see Xerneas moving like a Nascar after [using] Geomancy. I also believe the lack of abilities in the game is an inherent negative rather than a positive as it prevents the scope of complexity and more creativity as far as the battle system goes."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4608550-img_0599.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4608550" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4608550-img_0599.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4608550"></a><figcaption>A Pokemon trainer poses next to their Krookodile.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4608550-img_0599.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">The vast majority of people playing Legends: Z-A aren't going to be doing so competitively. However, competitive players can speak to the depth and consistency of mechanics, and thus the overall likelihood that this game will inspire a competitive scene.</p><p dir="ltr">Competitive Pokemon and live events are becoming a larger part of the fandom. Whether or not a game like Legends: Z-A is competition-worthy is the difference between being a game people complete and put down, and the mainline games where people continue to tinker with different combinations of teams for years to come. It's one key way for a fandom to develop around a game and sustain continued engagement with it, whether it's events tied to it or new content exploring the meta as players continue to tinker with the game.</p><p dir="ltr">Despite gaps in the current battle system, both Skraw and TheUziGunner emphasized that the new system has good bones. Whether or not this new way of battling can become a larger phenomena will depend on if The Pokemon Company and Game Freak continue to sharpen the battle system in Pokemon Legends: Z-A and future games, and plan events supporting a competitive scene tied to the series.</p><p dir="ltr">At the end of the day, if Legends: Z-A can get more people excited about playing Pokemon, then it can still help the competitive community. The Pokemon Company plans to release Pokemon Champions, a game that will focus on battling and serve as the software for the official Pokemon world tournament, in 2026. Legends: Z-A could get new players through the door that then try Pokemon Champions out, which could in turn convert people into competitive players.</p><p dir="ltr">"Pokemon's competitive scene needs two things to grow in my opinion and that's attention and lower barriers to entry," Skraw said. "We've seen, especially after this year's worlds, that The Pokemon Company International is putting more of a spotlight on the competitive aspect of the game, with coverage of events getting more thorough, commentary following storylines of trainers, more matches getting streamed etc. I think we're already on the trajectory for Pokemon's various competitive scenes to get larger and larger."</p>

<section><p>After a rocky launch, Bo: Path of the Teal Lotus is making a comeback with a major update that adds new challenges and gameplay updates.</p></section>
        
        
                    
              <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p dir="ltr">Last year, indie game publisher Humble Games went through what it called a restructuring, a process that resulted in mass layoffs. Not only were various staff members affected, but also several games under the publisher, including Bo: Path of the Teal Lotus. Developed by the small team at Squid Shock Studios, the colorful platformer inspired by Japanese folklore would turn out to be the final title published by the in-house team at Humble Games.</p><p dir="ltr">Fast-forward to November 2025, and Squid Shock Games is still hard at work on Bo: Path of the Teal Lotus. The team has just released the free Tanuki Kabuki update for the game, a major content drop that adds new post-game challenges, gameplay options, and collectibles to the game, with one of the highlights being a Kabuki-style Boss Rush mode where players battle in front of an audience that reacts to each clash. A new Gauntlet Mode has also been added, and this is a curated selection of challenges that also features customizable difficulty options.</p><p dir="ltr">Getting here wasn't easy for Squid Shock Games, as following the restructuring of Humble, the team had to fill multiple roles that the publisher had previously handled. We spoke to creative director Chris Stair about how the studio bounced back, was forced to adapt at the 11th hour, and the lessons learned from this ordeal.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d4Xd91I3jjs" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/d4Xd91I3jjs" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">"Honestly, the main thing was it left me--and my whole team at Squid Shock--feeling completely confused, abandoned, and lost right after launching our very first game. Bo: Path of the Teal Lotus was the first title Squid Shock ever released and the first game I'd ever worked on in my life. We had launched literally five days before Humble's restructuring hit," Stair said. "My team and I were on an absolute high. We were at Bit Summit in Kyoto, Japan, meeting devs we'd idolized for years, throwing an incredible launch party, soaking in all the love from the community. And then, overnight, it felt like the ground just vanished beneath us. Even just recollecting it right now makes my cortisol spike."</p><p dir="ltr">Stair added that it was a disheartening experience to see the news about Humble Games and receive emails from former employees at the publisher, many of whom he'd worked with on marketing the game. In a more practical sense, however, Stair now had to confront the fact that all the previously arranged post-launch publisher support had been dramatically altered. "No matter what anyone else might say, our launch was absolutely sullied by this. Not just the practical stuff, but my entire emotional and psychological state. So much mental bandwidth got eaten up by pure insecurity about what the hell was going to happen next that the studio and I went straight into survival mode. Resources and energy that should have gone into nurturing the game in its critical first weeks instead went into just keeping our heads above water," Stair said.</p><p dir="ltr">Following its departure from Humble Games, Squid Shock had to adapt and fill multiple behind-the-scenes roles--like marketing, press, creator outreach, gathering storefront feedback and sentiment, QA coordination, localization fixes, and more--quickly, but the single biggest "nightmare" for the studio were the console patches.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4608483-6-bo_pathoftheteallotus-officialscreenshot-bomoon.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4608483" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4608483-6-bo_pathoftheteallotus-officialscreenshot-bomoon.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4608483"></a><figcaption>Bo: Path of the Teal Lotus  </figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4608483-6-bo_pathoftheteallotus-officialscreenshot-bomoon.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Stair explained that Humble had been their middleman with console companies like Sony, Nintendo, and Microsoft. When the publisher restructured, their connections to the big three were greatly impacted, ultimately resulting in an inability to release vital updates. "It really sucked reading player feedback about bugs and performance issues on certain platforms and knowing we literally couldn't do anything about it for months," Stair said. "I think this really irreparably damaged our reputation on certain platforms, especially Xbox, which had some nasty crashes on launch."</p><p dir="ltr">While sales of Bo: Path of the Teal Lotus were "moderately successful," they didn't meet the expectations that Squid Shock had for the game. "We were given a conservative estimate of how many copies we would sell in the first year and we really fell short of that," Stair added. "Is that because of the issues we had with Humble? There's no way to actually prove it, but obviously that whole situation only hurt our ability to deliver a better product over time."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4608484-atrailermaster.00_00_38_15.still007.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4608484" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4608484-atrailermaster.00_00_38_15.still007.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4608484"></a><figcaption>Bo: Path of the Teal Lotus</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4608484-atrailermaster.00_00_38_15.still007.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">The tragedy here is that Squid Shock had a good working relationship with Humble before its sudden closure. Stair says that while they weren't perfect, the publisher knew what it was doing and it "provided incredible support throughout development" that would not have been there if the studio had gone down the self-publishing route. As Stair explained, publishers do far more than just help get a video game out the door, as a good company can help with QA, localization, production timelines, porting, trailers, subscription deals, and so much more. All essential factors in a game finding success in a crowded and very competitive market.</p><p dir="ltr">Squid Shock is now working with Good Games Group,a publishing group founded by former Humble employees. If you're interested in seeing Bo: Path Of The Teal Lotus in action, it'll be featured in a Games Done Quick livestream this weekend.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Ever since </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-review-hero-shooter-overwatch-netease-1851717975"><i><span>Marvel Rivals</span></i></a> <span>launched last December, it’s been hit with well-founded accusations of ripping off </span><i><span>Overwatch</span></i><span>. From gameplay modes to hero kits, NetEase’s superhero shooter is chock-full of what feel like direct pulls from Blizzard’s trailblazing game. But now that </span><i><span>Marvel Rivals </span></i><span>has been out long enough for </span><i><span>Overwatch 2 </span></i><span>to be learning from it, the rip-off accusations have come full circle. The latest target of such critiques is </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-vendetta-reveal-trailer-cinematic-video-2000644926"><i><span>Overwatch 2</span></i><span>’s new hero Vendetta</span></a><span>, who </span><i><span>Marvel Rivals </span></i><span>fans argue is similar to one of its heroes because she…uses a big sword, I guess.</span></p> <p><span>Though the realities of how long it takes to develop content for </span><i><span>Overwatch 2 </span></i><span>are at odds with a lot of these claims, the internet loves a narrative. If Blizzard introduces a third-person mode a few months after </span><i><span>Marvel Rivals </span></i><span>launches, those committed to misunderstanding how video game development works will hoop and holler about how Blizzard is chasing NetEase’s success, despite </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-perks-stadium-season-15-spotlight-preview-1851761919"><i><span>Overwatch 2</span></i><span>’s third-person Stadium mode</span></a><span> having been in development far longer than the few months its competitor had been on the market.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>Now, however, it’s been long enough that </span><i><span>Overwatch 2 </span></i><span>can introduce a character or concept that could have conceivably been pulled from </span><i><span>Marvel Rivals</span></i><span>, and fans are accusing Vendetta, with her sword-based fighting style and mobility skills, of being modeled on Magik from NetEase’s game. Others, meanwhile, are pointing out that “lady with big sword” is hardly a trademarked concept, and arguing that </span><i><span>Overwatch </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Marvel Rivals </span></i><span>should be </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-overwatch-2-role-queue-cross-progression-1851749687"><span>learning from each other</span></a><span>.</span></p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Someone’s going to say Overwatch copied Marvel Rivals when they see Vendettas gameplay aren’t they <a href="https://t.co/bg2TDmHika">pic.twitter.com/bg2TDmHika</a></p> <p>— Frankiep423 (@frankiep423) <a href="https://twitter.com/frankiep423/status/1991567486026936570?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 20, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">"copy my homework, just dont make it obvious"<br>the homework: <a href="https://t.co/BiThZ3qibd">pic.twitter.com/BiThZ3qibd</a></p> <p>— Andrew (@whyAndr3w) <a href="https://twitter.com/whyAndr3w/status/1991690771033125216?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 21, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Literally Magik gameplay 😭 <a href="https://t.co/eEBJnveNw9">https://t.co/eEBJnveNw9</a></p> <p>— 𐌀Ᏽ𐌀𐌌Ꝋ𐌕𐌕Ꝋ (@AgamottoSupreme) <a href="https://twitter.com/AgamottoSupreme/status/1991574897655730322?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 20, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Yeah because Rivals totally invented the "woman with big sword" concept.

              <p>Progress in any sport comes down to understanding your numbers. To get better, you need a clear picture of what you’re aiming for—and a way to keep tabs on it. Whether you’re starting to run, hitting the trails, diving into the pool, or tackling any outdoor activity, a good GPS watch can be the tool that keeps you focused and moving forward instead of losing momentum.<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5796/"> Samsung happens to have its newly released for 2025 model of the its smart watches—the Galaxy Watch 8—on sale ahead of Black Friday.</a> Normally this smart watch goes for $350 for the 40mm model, but right now you can save 20%. That brings the price down to just $280. Likewise, the 44mm model is one sale for 18% off. That one comes down from $380 to just $310 for a limited time.</p>

<h2>Your Own Personal Fitness Coach</h2>
<p data-start="127" data-end="690">The Galaxy Watch 8 is driven by Samsung’s Galaxy AI platform. When you head out for a bike ride, a jog, or any outdoor training session, the watch lets you track and compare your live performance against your past activity data. Throughout the day, it delivers wellness prompts and tailored recommendations designed to keep you progressing toward your personal fitness and health goals. Galaxy AI also enhances workout monitoring with upgraded heart-rate analysis that filters out natural body movements, offering a more precise reading than previous generations.</p>
<p data-start="692" data-end="1042">Your sleep patterns are closely monitored as well, helping detect potential signs of sleep apnea and providing deeper insights into your nightly rest. Each day, you can check a summarized energy level and physical readiness score that factors in your sleep quality, daily step count, heart-rate trends, and more to paint a clearer picture of your overall physical state.</p>
<p data-start="1044" data-end="1476" data-is-last-node="" data-is-only-node="">Beyond fitness tracking, the Samsung Galaxy Watch 8 supports your everyday tasks as a full-featured smartwatch. You can view and reply to messages directly from your wrist without reaching for your phone. When paired with your smartphone, it even doubles as a remote camera controller, letting you take group photos or selfies from afar while adjusting settings, activating the timer, or triggering the shutter right from the watch.</p>


<h2 data-start="1044" data-end="1476">Improvements This Generation</h2>
<p>Among the improvements in Galaxy Watch 8 over its predecessor—the Galaxy Watch 7—you’ll find a slimmer, sleeker design. The new model has more of a square-shaped bezel with the screen going much brighter. The Galaxy Watch 8 is capable of reaching up to 3,000 nits of brightness while the Watch 7 comes in at a max of 2,000 nits, making the new watch easier to see in direct sunlight. Both the 8 and the 7 are built to withstand harsh weather conditions so you can take it outside training year round, rain or shine.</p>
<p>You’ll also see improvements to battery life as well. There are two versions of the Galaxy Watch 8, and each use a different size battery. On the 40mm model, you get a 325mAh battery and on the 44mm, you get a much larger 435mAh battery. Both of which come in at a higher capacity than their Watch 7 counterparts.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5796/">The Galaxy Watch 8 comes built from the ground up for use with Gemini—Samsung and Google’s AI assistant.</a> Use it to manage your calendar, respond to texts, set reminders—you name it.</p>

<p>Sony decision to release PlayStation games on Steam seems to be paying off. According to one analytics firm, the company has made over $1.2 billion since it began putting first-party games on the platform.</p>



<p>In its latest report, Alinea Analytics goes into detail on the success of PlayStation Studios’ titles. They mention that the number comes after Valve’s cut of sales is taken into account.</p>

Of that total, Sony received $1.2 billion while Valve has come away with at least $350 million. For Valve’s portion of the cuts, they take 30% of sales initially. Once a game reaches $10 million in sales, that drops to 25%. After $50 million it falls a bit further to 20%.</p>



<p>Still, even with the profits that are going to Valve, Sony has to be pleased with what PlayStation games are generating on the platform. </p>



<h2 id="h-five-games-lead-the-way-for-playstation-on-steam">Five Games Lead The Way For PlayStation On Steam</h2>



<p>Going into their estimates,—again, it’s important to note that many of these numbers haven’t been fully confirmed by Sony—Alinea reports that Helldivers 2 is the most successful first-party game on Steam. Since its release in February 2024, the game has sold 12.7 million copies. In a distant second is Horizon Zero Dawn, which sold 4.5 million copies. That’s then followed by God of War at 4.2 million, Days Gone at 3.4 million, and Spider-Man Remastered with 2.7 million copies sold.</p>



<p>Despite the success of these games, Alinea cautions that the “novelty” of PlayStation games on Steam is wearing off a bit.</p>



<p><strong>“The audience that was once excited to experience these games for the first time has largely been served,”</strong> Alinea’s head of market analysis Rhys Elliot said. <strong>“Later releases naturally face smaller potential audiences, and our estimates clearly show this.”</strong></p>







<p>Looking at their data, Alinea notes that sales were stronger when PlayStation first started releasing its titles on Steam. One example they used is God of War. When it released, the game sold 2.5 million copies in 427 days. That ended up being 2.5x more than the sequel, God of War Ragnarök,&nbsp;sold in the same timeframe. </p>



<p>Another game used was Spider-Man and Spider-Man 2. Over the first 294 days on the platform, Spider-Man sold twice as many copies as its sequel.</p>



<p>Whether this is a worrying trend or just a case of players not wanting to play the latest games right now remains to be seen. There have been rumors of Sony changing its strategy when it comes to whether or not it keeps releasing PlayStation games on Steam. With the reported generated revenue thus far, however, it feels like Sony could be leaving a lot of money on the table if they were to pull back. </p>

                <p>Europe's law enforcement agency is taking a closer look at online multiplayer games and gaming-adjacent platforms as the fears that criminals could be grooming, manipulating, and weaponizing children to commit violent crimes rise sharply in European society.</p><p>Europol (or the European Union Agency for Law Enforcement Cooperation) partnered with eight countries to identify and remove thousands of incidents of hateful rhetoric shared on gaming and gaming-related platforms. Conducted on November 13 and in partnership with Denmark, Finland, Germany, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, and the United Kingdom, Europol's <a href="https://www.europol.europa.eu/media-press/newsroom/news/europol-and-partner-countries-combat-online-radicalisation-gaming-platforms" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Referral Action Day program</a> reportedly uncovered around 5,408 links to jihadist content, 1,070 links to violent right-wing extremist and terrorist content, and 105 links to racist and xenophobic content on a variety of unnamed gaming platforms.</p><p>Europol's executive director, Catherine De Bolle, <a href="https://www.politico.eu/article/children-groomed-for-murder-through-video-games-europol-warns/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">spoke to Politico</a> on November 21 about her fears following the findings by that joint committee dubbed the European Union Internet Referral Unit (EU IRU). De Bolle said that, through these gaming platforms, criminal networks are recruiting children to engage in torture and murder.</p><p>"The weaponization of children for organized crime groups is what is going on at the moment on European soil," she said. "They weaponize the children to torture or to kill. It's not about petty theft anymore. It's about big crimes. [In one] worst-case, [we've seen a young boy who was ordered] to kill his younger sister, which happened. It’s cruel; we have never seen this before."</p><p>Europol discovered that criminals start grooming children by first joining their online multiplayer chats to talk about innocuous topics like family and pets. These public chats then move to more private servers where children are convinced to share sensitive data, such as family names and home addresses. With this knowledge, criminals could bribe or blackmail children into harming their families or themselves.</p><p>The Referral Action Day program uncovered all kinds of dangerous and violent content after combing through copious gaming and streaming platforms. According to the EU IRU's findings, criminals would re-enact terrorist attacks, executions, or school shootings in a game, edit videos with chants or suggestive emojis, and then share them on many commonly used social media platforms.</p><p>Europol claimed there have been at least 105 instances, including 10 contract killings, where violent crimes were "performed as a service" by children. Sometimes, the children were offered as much as $20,000 to commit the act, though Europol said not every child received their payment. If a child, viewed as a kind of remote-operated weapon, doesn't commit the act, then the criminals will shock them with horror as a reminder of what's owed.</p><p>"We also have children who do not execute the order and then, for instance, [the criminals] kill the pet of the child, so that the child knows very well, 'We know where you live, we know who you are, you will obey, and if you don't, we will go even further to kill your mother or your father,'" De Bolle explained. "Parents blame themselves in a lot of cases. They do not understand how it is possible. The problem is you don’t have access to everything your child does and you respect also the privacy of your children. But as a parent, you need to talk about the dangers of the internet."</p><p>Whether the child is bullied at school, has psychological problems, or is healthy and happy, De Bolle said no minor is safe. Criminals even go as far as extending the nature of the crime, from domestic violence to information spying for a hybrid war by state actors.</p><p>"You also have it with hybrid threat actors that are looking for the crime as a service model--the young perpetrators to listen to the foreign state, to listen to the communication around buildings," De Bolle said.</p><p>Though not specifically cited by Europol and the EU IRU, the game creation platform <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/roblox-game-client/" data-ref-id="5000-451936">Roblox</a> has raised alarms for parents and politicians over the years regarding children's safety concerns. The platform, which has a player base that's mostly under the age of 13, has been at the center of a handful of recent lawsuits over child exploitation and grooming. States like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/florida-ag-alleges-roblox-is-a-predator-breeding-ground-opens-investigation/1100-6535594/" data-ref-id="1100-6535594">Florida</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/texas-sues-roblox-over-child-exploitation-and-grooming-concerns/1100-6536037/" data-ref-id="1100-6536037">Texas</a> are suing developer Roblox Corporation for failing to protect kids. Roblox Corporation has <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/roblox-will-try-harder-to-keep-kids-from-talking-to-strangers/1100-6536311/" data-ref-id="1100-6536311">announced a new face-scanning initiative</a> to verify the ages of its users and prevent minors from talking to adults, but <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/roblox-is-not-doing-enough-to-protect-kids-lawmaker-says/1100-6533929/" data-ref-id="1100-6533929">a California lawmaker</a> believes the developer should continue to "do more" to ensure the safety of the minors who play the game.</p>

            <p>Team Cherry has teased more <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hollow-knight">Hollow Knight</a> releases beyond <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hollow-knight-silksong">Silksong</a>, which (if they ever do materialise) would sit alongside the studio's previous games, rather than act as any kind of continuation that would require an understanding of earlier lore to appreciate.</p>
<p>In a newly unearthed interview with <a href="https://www.acmi.net.au/works/125388--hollow-knight-silksong-game-worlds-acmi/">ACMI</a> (the Australian Centre for the Moving Image), which appears to have been conducted ahead of Hollow Knight: Silksong's release in September, Team Cherry studio leads Ari Gibson and William Pellen discussed their Hollow Knight titles.</p>

<p><span data-type="targeting">

<!-- code from Primis -->
<p>When asked by the co-curator of the ACMI's Game Worlds exhibition how the duo would define success, the developers both agreed that releasing Silksong with "no major bugs" would of course be desirable (thanks, <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/platformer/team-cherry-hopes-if-there-were-ever-new-hollow-knight-games-after-silksong-they-could-just-exist-alongside-one-another-so-the-order-you-play-them-doesnt-matter/">GamesRadar+</a>).</p>
<p>Pellen then said "the 'goal' is already kind of done, I think," stating: "We had an idea for a game that we wanted to make, and we wanted to make the best version of that game, a version of the game that satisfies the theme, the best version we can make."</p><p>Gibson agreed with Pellen's words here, adding the aim with Silksong was to make "a game that can stand alongside Hollow Knight." He noted Silksong "kind of branches off in a nice way" and so the two games "really complement" each other. "It's nice developing something where there's no tech race," Gibson continued. "We're not trying to push boundaries; we have a very set style, it's pretty simple."</p>
<p>The Team Cherry studio head then said he doesn't think players would "feel like you lost anything, traveling back to the original game after playing Silksong," before adding this rather teasing little comment.</p>
<p>"And if there were ever others, we would hope that they all follow that same pattern – that the series is all games that just exist alongside one another."</p>
<p>Now obviously this is a very hypothetical 'if' from the developer, and by no way means that we can expect an entire Hollow Knight series with more entries than the Witcher and Game of Thrones books combined. But even so, it is nice to know that the developers still see a possibility that they could return with some more Hollow Knights in the future.</p>

<p>On its release, we awarded Silksong five stars. "Pretty and charmingly mean-spirited, this is a game filled with revelations and genuine personality," reads <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hollow-knight-silksong-review">Eurogamer's Silksong review</a>.</p>
<p>For more, our Bertie recently spoke to several developers about the impact Silksong's low price will have on other indie games. Does it really matter, or has Team Cherry unexpectedly set a precedent for other indie games going forward? You can find out in Bertie's feature: <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/is-hollow-knight-silksongs-cheap-price-a-problem-for-other-indie-games-devs-and-publishers-weigh-up-its-impact">Is Hollow Knight Silksong's 'cheap' price a problem for other indie games?

<p>Here's the full announcement statement, followed by the post itself:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Huh?! UNDERTALE X SQUARE ENIX?!<br>
...Yeah, you read that right.<br>
To celebrate UNDERTALE's 10th anniversary, a special collaboration with SQEX Music &amp; Merchandising is happening!</p>

</blockquote>

<p>The specifics on the merch will have to wait for another day — the <a href="https://www.jp.square-enix.com/music/sem/page/UNDERTALE/en/">Square Enix website</a> is currently awash with "Coming Soon" messages on the 'Goods' front — but we do know that a chilled soundtrack titled '<a href="https://na.store.square-enix-games.com/undertale_-chitei-de-chill">Undertale: Chitei de Chill</a>' will be released early next year.</p>
<p>This one is now available to pre-order from the <a href="https://gb.store.square-enix-games.com/undertale_-chitei-de-chill">Square Enix Store</a> for <strong>$39.99 / £29.99</strong>, and features renditions of 20 Undertale tracks in beautifully chilled arrangements. You'll find the sweet new cover art, by painter NOVOL, and the official CD blurb text below:</p>
