                <p>If you've been playing <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-sims-4/" data-ref-id="5000-179949">The Sims 4</a> for a while--and there's a decent chance you have, since it's been out for 11 years--playing as just a regular human sim might be a little bit boring at this point. Fortunately, there are plenty of non-human options, in the form of "occult" sims--you know, vampires, werewolves, ghosts, and all that stuff. In The Sims 4, your sim can abandon the trappings of normal life and try out an entirely new state of being--so long as they know where to look to find one, that is.</p><p dir="ltr">But that's why we're here. We've gathered all the key details about each of the occult life states in The Sims 4--werewolves, vampires, mermaids, aliens, magic wielders, and ghosts--and assembled them below in a relatively short, sweet, and easy-to-digest way so you can get started investigating the stranger ways of life in Maxis' life sim.</p><div data-embed-type="toc"><p><span><strong>Table of Contents</strong> [<a data-toggle="collapse" href="#toc_list">hide</a>]</span></p><ul id="toc_list"><ul><li><a href="#How_to_create_an_occult_sim_by_birth">How to create an occult sim by birth</a></li></ul><li><a href="#1__Vampire__Vampires_DLC_">1.

The rules are the same for all occult varieties. With two parents of the same occult type, the offspring is guaranteed to also be one of them--two vampire parents equals a vampire baby. With one occult parent and one normal human sim as the other parent, there's a 50% chance of the baby also having that parent's occult life state.</p><p dir="ltr">If parents of two different occult types have a kid, like if a vampire hooked up with a werewolf, the child will have an even chance of being one of the two types. But it won't be both, as the Sims 4 doesn't natively support occult hybrids. But <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-sims-4-mods/2900-5275/" data-ref-id="2900-5275">there are mods</a> that can help with that.</p><p dir="ltr">Now, let's dive into the details for each specific occult type.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="1__Vampire__Vampires_DLC_">1. Vampire (Vampires DLC)</h2><p dir="ltr"><strong>How to become a vampire</strong></p><p dir="ltr">You can make your sim a vampire in Create-a-Sim, by having them become pals with a vampire and ask them to turn them.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>What changes once your sim is a vampire</strong></p><p dir="ltr">When your sim becomes a vampire, their energy and hunger needs are replaced by vampire energy and thirst, and they'll no longer have to use the toilet. Oh, and they'll never age. But it's not all positive, as vampires can die from sun exposure, they get sick if they eat food, and they constantly need to feed their thirst for blood, or they'll go feral and start attacking people randomly.</p><p dir="ltr">Vampires also have a unique skill chart that they can progress through by doing vampire things. Through the skill chart, they can become much more powerful and remove some of the downsides of vampirism, like vulnerability to sunlight, and they'll gain special powers as they improve themselves. But leveling up their vampire skills will require taking some negative perks as well.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Pros</strong></p><p dir="ltr">The path of the vampire provides an alternate method to reach some of the lifetime aspiration rewards that would otherwise take much longer to earn, like removing the need to sleep or bathe. And vampirism has a major advantage over all other forms of immortality in The Sims 4, because there's a perk that deadens your sim's emotions so they don't get super depressed any time one of their distant relatives dies--which might be pretty often if your sim has lived a long time. And while the thirst is obnoxious, it's very easy to obtain plasma packs and fruit so you don't have to feed on other sims if you don't want to.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Cons</strong></p><p dir="ltr">The downsides of being a vampire are well known: sunlight will kill them, garlic is poison, they can't sleep in a normal bed, and they have to drink blood all the time. Fortunately, you can mitigate most of the biggest negatives, but the fact that you must take several bad perks along with the good ones as you level up your vampire skills means being a vampire is never smooth sailing.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>How to cure vampirism</strong></p><p dir="ltr">Sims who have maxed out their Vampire Lore skill will be able to mix the Ultimate Vampire Cure using the mixology skill at any bar. They just have to drink it to return to normal.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="2__Werewolf__Werewolves_DLC_">2. Werewolf (Werewolves DLC)</h2><p dir="ltr"><strong>How to become a werewolf</strong></p><p dir="ltr">Make one in Create-a-Sim, or have a werewolf bite a sim and turn.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>What changes once your sim is a werewolf</strong></p><p dir="ltr">Your sim will become a werewolf, and will transform into its wolf form every full moon. They'll have a new gauge on the needs panel called Fury, which will increase regularly as a result of mood changes or doing werewolf activities--the more fury your werewolf sims have, the more animalistic their behavior will become. As part of this system, all werewolves in The Sims 4 have a temperament that dictates what sorts of things get them riled up.</p><p dir="ltr">Werewolves also have their own unique skill tree that will allow them to level up their abilities and dampen some of the downsides. In addition to the standard skill tree, werewolves can unlock six dormant abilities by doing specific activities. And, naturally, they can form wolf packs that run together--this social group is key to werewolf happiness, as they aren't loners like vampires.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Pros</strong></p><p dir="ltr">Playing as a werewolf provides some pretty offbeat new options for how to play The Sims 4--one werewolf perk, for example, allows your sim to eat the furniture, and another allows you to quickly travel around by burrowing through the ground. And, like most occult types, once you've maxed out the skill tree, your sim can live forever. They'll still age, but they won't die from being old.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Cons</strong></p><p dir="ltr">The Fury meter can be pretty obnoxious to keep under control in the early goings, as going into a rampage is really not great for your sim's social standing in the community. But werewolves don't have any mortal vulnerabilities like vampires do. Even so, this is the most esoteric of the occult states, making it the biggest departure from standard Sims 4 gameplay.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>How to cure the werewolf condition</strong></p><p dir="ltr">A sim can turn back into a regular person using the Lunar Epiphany dormant ability, which is unlocked by reading werewolf tomes.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="3__Spellcaster__Realm_of_Magic_DLC_">3. Spellcaster (Realm of Magic DLC)</h2><p dir="ltr"><strong>How to become a spellcaster</strong></p><p dir="ltr">Using Create-a-Sim, by asking for the Rite of Ascension from one of the sages in the Magic Realm, or by asking another spellcaster sim who is powerful enough.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>What changes when your sim is a spellcaster</strong></p><p dir="ltr">Spellcasters will unlock a unique skill tree that they can progress through by using any magical ability, but they'll also have to learn magic powers and alchemical recipes individually. Your sim can do this by practicing each of the three magic types to learn spells, or by experimenting with a cauldron to learn potion recipes. They'll also be able to use magic wands, which will enhance their powers.</p><p dir="ltr">However, using magic will also increase a new spellcaster charge meter--the higher that meter is, the more likely a spell will malfunction and might kill your sim.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Pros</strong></p><p dir="ltr">Learning spells and potions will unlock all sorts of mundane abilities that will make your sim's life easier, like the ability to repair any broken object in an instant, or duplicate stuff. You could brew a Potion of Plentiful Needs, which fills all your sim's need meters, and then use the copypasto spell to dupe it until you have a lifetime supply of them for your entire extended family. Your sim can also brew a Potion of Immortality, which will prevent them from ever dying of old age, or use a spell to turn a ghost back into a living sim.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Cons</strong></p><p dir="ltr">There are no downsides to becoming a spellcaster. Everything about this lifestate is an improvement.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>How to get rid of your spellcaster status</strong></p><p dir="ltr">You can take the Rite of Dissolution from any of the sages in the Magic Realm to remove your spellcaster status. If your sim then decides to become a spellcaster again later, their power will be at the same level as it was before, but you'll need to reassign the skill tree perks again.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="4__Alien__Get_to_Work_DLC_">4. Alien (Get to Work DLC)</h2><p dir="ltr"><strong>How to become an alien</strong></p><p dir="ltr">Sims cannot turn into aliens--they have to be made in Create-a-Sim, or born that way. But a sim can use a satellite to goad aliens into abducting them, which sometimes results in an alien pregnancy regardless of your sim's gender. Kids born as a result will always be aliens.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>What's different when playing as an alien</strong></p><p dir="ltr">Not much changes with the alien life state compared with the other occult types. Aliens can have blue or purple skin, and can disguise themselves as humans to avoid any awkwardness. There's no skill tree, per se, but aliens have unique abilities, like being able to transmute a metal or crystal into another kind of metal or crystal at random. They also have empathy skills that allow them to understand the feelings of any sim they speak to, and they can also copy their emotional state.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Pros</strong></p><p dir="ltr">Essentially, playing as an alien sim is like playing as a normal sim but with a couple extra perks. So it's different, but not <em>that</em> different.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Cons</strong></p><p dir="ltr">None</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="5__Mermaid__Island_Living_DLC_">5. Mermaid (Island Living DLC)</h2><p dir="ltr"><strong>How to become a mermaid</strong></p><p dir="ltr">Using Create-a-sim, being born that way, or by eating Mermadic Kelp that you can find in the world or purchase from the aspiration rewards for 500 points.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>What changes when your sim is a mermaid</strong></p><p dir="ltr">When a sim becomes a mermaid, they grow a tail. They can still turn back into their normal form with legs when on land, however. They'll also swap the hunger need for the unique hydration need--mermaids have to stay moist, or they will die.</p><p dir="ltr">Mermaids receive a number of inherent abilities, which deplete the hydration meter with each use--you'll need to be careful with them or else your sim will dry themselves out. They can sing various lullabies that inspire specific moods in the sims who hear them. They can talk to fish and dolphins, and they can do evil stuff too, like luring swimmers into the water and then pulling them under, potentially drowning them. They can also control the weather to a small degree.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Pros</strong></p><p dir="ltr">If your sim lives in Sulani or another watery world, the mermaid's ability to swim much faster than a normal sim can be a huge boon, and the ability to talk to and become pals with fish is fun.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Cons</strong></p><p dir="ltr">The hydration meter can be tougher to deal with if you don't live next to the ocean. While baths and showers do help, swimming in pools or using hot tubs (or anything else with chlorinated water) will actually dry your sim out more.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="6__Ghost__Life__amp__Death_DLC_">6. Ghost (Life &amp; Death DLC)</h2><p dir="ltr"><strong>How to become a ghost</strong></p><p dir="ltr">Die.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>What changes when your sim becomes a ghost</strong></p><p dir="ltr">Your sim will no longer be a corporeal being, and will instead become a glowing spirit. This unlocks the Ghost Mastery skill tree, which allows a sim not just to gain new ghostly abilities, but also to choose whether they become a good ghost or a dastardly one. Examples of the bad ghost abilities include haunting household objects, giving other sims nightmares, or cursing them with bad luck. On the friendly side of things, a ghost sim can replenish a living sim's needs, save the life of a sim who just died, or just bless them with good fortune.</p><p dir="ltr">Occult sims who died as a result of their weakness, like a vampire dying to sunlight, will retain their occult abilities in their ghost form.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Pros</strong></p><p dir="ltr">Since they have no physical presence, ghosts can do a lot of random things normal sims can't, like walking through walls or even other sims--which makes them feel strange, but in a good way. Ghosts can also do jump scares for fun.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Cons</strong></p><p dir="ltr">While a ghost can do most things a regular sim can, there are limits--a ghost can't have a kid, for one thing.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>How to stop being a ghost</strong></p><p dir="ltr">The ghost state is the only occult state that can be cured in multiple different ways. A ghost can be turned back into a living sim using a Book of Life written by an author sim, by cooking ambrosia, or by using the magic spell Dedeathify. A ghost can also pass on and be reincarnated as a new sim by swimming in the waters of Revenwood.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/how-to/revenge-of-the-savage-planet-how-to-capture-creatures/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>You'll do a lot of collecting in <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/revenge-of-the-savage-planet-review-funny-beautiful-and-tedious/">Revenge of the Savage Planet</a>, including collecting the creatures you discover while roaming the four main planets you visit across the game's story. In some cases, capturing and researching these creatures is essential to your progression in the game.</p>
<p>So, how do you capture creatures? Some of the exact details for each creature change the process slightly, but the rules are mostly the same. This guide will show you how to capture creatures in Revenge of the Savage Planet, so you'll be prepared for anything that has the misfortune of being in your way.</p>
<h2>Revenge Of The Savage Planet - How To Capture Creatures</h2>
<p>Before we get into the how of capturing creatures in Revenge of the Savage Planet, you'll need to make sure you've already collected your whip. Without it, you can't capture anything. You'll also want to make sure that you're not surrounded by plenty of other creatures that will be hostile towards you.</p>
<p>Any interruption means you restart the process, so it's good to single out one creature to capture at a time.</p>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>When you have a creature you want to capture in your sights, the very first thing you'll want to do is scan it. Jump into scanning mode, and give it a scan, even if you've already scanned that species. The info box that will appear next to it will remind you of anything you need to be aware of when engaging and trying to capture that creature.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>What you do next will depend on the size of the creature you're trying to capture. Most creatures will require you to stun them in some way, usually by hitting a weak spot with your blaster. Others don't need that kind of preamble. You can just hold your whip button until you're swinging it over your head like a lasso. You'll be able to tell if it can be captured if a small circle appears on the creature, signifying that your whip is locked on.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>Once you've locked onto the creature, release your whip and you'll start a small tug-of-war mini-game with the creature. Just keep the whip button held, and so long as you're not interrupted, you'll pull the creature close enough to capture it.</li>
</ul>

            <p>
Tron is a world that I feel constantly surprised by its perseverance in just flat out still being a thing all these years later. And yet, I never feel upset about it given that the vibes of Tron just absolutely rule no matter the context in which they're being delivered, the upcoming Jared Leto led film notwithstanding because of that guy's whole vibe. In terms of what's actually next for the fictitious video game world, there's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/tron-catalyst">Tron: Catalyst</a> from the folks over <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/bithell-games">Bithell Games</a>, and as it so happens, there's a demo out for it today!
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
The demo, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3025590/TRON_Catalyst/">available on Steam</a>, apparently makes up the first hour of the game, which certainly sounds like a healthy amount of time to suss out its vibes. In case you missed the announcement on this one, Tron: Catalyst is a top-down, sort of but not quite isometric <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-action-games">action</a> game where you play as Exo, a courier whose life gets shaken up by a mysterious package exploding leaving him with unusual abilities.
</p>
<p>
It's set in the Arq <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/grid">Grid</a>, a location previously established in Bithell Games' <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/tron-identity">Tron: Identity</a>, a visual novel set in the Disney-owned universe. Storywise, the Arq Grid is a bit unstable, with glitches causing time to loop, and only Exo can see them. Lots of good stuff to latch onto here, and yes, you do have a Disc to fight with and a Light Cycle to ride around on, everything you'd want from a Tron game is here.
</p>
<p>
If you're not the demo type, one, did you never buy a copy of Official PlayStation Magazine in the 2000s, and, two, that's fine, because it's due out on June 17th, just a couple of weeks away. I'm sure that's enough time to get some distance from the launch of the Switch 2, and Summer Game Fest, and tomorrow's PlayStation showcase, and the millions of other showcases happening in way too short of a timespan.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/unreal%E2%80%99s-ai-demo-had-no-point.1206234/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/state-of-unreal-persona-device-ai-demo<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>During this morning’s State of Unreal presentation, Epic showed a first look at what Executive Vice President Saxs Persson called the “next step” from <em>Fortnite</em>’s recent <a href="https://aftermath.site/fortnite-ai-darth-vader-star-wars-epic-games-sag-aftra" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">AI Darth Vader disaster</a>: tools to create AI-powered NPCs that respond to players’ speech. This was demonstrated by a demo controlled by two guys named Andrew, who played a bad <em>Portal</em> knockoff that we’re all supposed to believe is the future.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="State of Unreal 2025 Official 4K Livestream I Unreal Fest Orlando" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/AjikvaR0i34?start=6785&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Using what Epic calls a “Persona Device,” developers can set parameters for an AI character’s knowledge and personality; in this instance, an entity called “Mr. Buttons” that wants to get the player to push a button. The AI draws from “facts” written in natural language. Mr. Buttons is told to “Encourage [the player] to press the button; narrate stories, use poems or songs of entities that discovered new realms by taking a single action while adding comedic commentary.” It’s encouraged to “prioritize playful banter” and “include humor metaphors.” Conversely, it’s told to avoid the phrase “you say” as cover for parroting the players’ words, to not call the player “a player,” and not to swear.</p><figure><figcaption>The "facts" for Mr. Buttons in the Persona Device</figcaption></figure><p>It more or less does all these things. (It does sprinkle a “you say” in there.) Mr. Buttons tries to be grandiose and compellingly evasive, refusing to say precisely what the button does while hyping it up. “Think of the stories we could tell, the realms we could conquer,” it hints. When the Andrews try to leave the area through a door, it pulls them back to the button and gets angry, though never overly so. If you look at this purely as a tech demo, devoid of context or the requirement to be a good piece of writing (because, of course, it isn’t a piece of writing), it’s not unimpressive. It is, at its base level, a clear character with a strong motivation, able to respond to any question the Andrews ask it, all of it created out of what Persson says is “about 20 lines of text in total.”</p><p>But the actual scene that plays out sucks. It’s formless and meandering; the conversation doesn’t build, and Mr. Buttons’ threats and enticements don’t escalate, instead bumping against the confines of its parameters until the Andrews inevitably push the button. Mr. Buttons feels like it’s trying to have the omnipotent, shady vibes of <em>Portal</em>’s GLaDOS, but it can’t attain the wordplay and creativity of that character because it wasn’t written by real human writers. It does reach toward cleverness: at one point, when an Andrew asks what the button does, it says the button is “a gateway to glory, a ticket to transformation, a symphony of–well, you get the idea. It does things.” That <em>sounds</em> funny, right? There’s alliteration, a sense of build, and then a comedic letdown in the form of a <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/why-does-everyone-in-netflixs-cowboy-bebop-talk-like-that/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Whedon-esque</a> “things.” It has the shape of a line a writer would write and a voice actor would say.&nbsp;</p><p>But any humor in this line is bungled by the stilted, flat delivery; it doesn’t say the line in a funny way, because of course it can’t. Mr. Buttons makes thinking sounds as it processes in ways that don’t make sense for the character. At a couple points in the conversation it mispronounces dramatic bellows of “noooow” and “dooo” in ways that make it clear it’s AI; not in the robotic delivery of Ellen McLain, an intentional choice made by humans, but just because that’s how voice software works.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>All of this is only “good” if you hold it against the standards of what AI can do, something that you, a regular person reading this, have no need to engage in. If I were playing this experience without knowing it was AI, I would think some beginning creators had taken their best shot at writing and voice acting. I’d root for the humans who made it, maybe. But as AI, it’s just… pointless. It’s made an experience there’s no reason to play, its only praise-worthy feature that it made something worse than humans could do without requiring very much active human input. It might be impressive as a 13-year-old’s English class project, given that its parameters demonstrate a firm understanding of character and motivation. But if actual game developers put this in front of me–worse still, if they wanted my money–I’d just think they were lazy hacks.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Through the demo, Mr. Buttons reassures the Andrews that nothing bad will happen to the audience once they press the button. But something does: they press it, the screen and stage go dark, and then Tim Sweeney appears. Sweeney says, “Well, they pressed the AI button. And it might have been a bad idea, but, like, in truth, there’s no unpressing that button.” Sweeney goes on to say, with <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/91336991/openai-anthropic-deepseek-ai-models-environmental-impact" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">no hint of irony</a>, that “When the world’s on fire, we [at Epic] like to back up and remember our aims as game developers: it’s to make fun games. And AI can help us with this. So we’ve come to see AI as an opportunity to have a multiplying force on human creatives.”&nbsp;</p><p>He calls it “multiplying” with <a href="https://www.bloodinthemachine.com/p/the-ai-jobs-apocalypse-is-for-the" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">no hint of irony</a> either, going on to cite the ability for small teams to make characters and code more easily. This of course also means more people able to make things more easily within Epic’s ecosystem. Epic’s collaborations with Disney and Lego featured heavily in the State of Unreal presentation; an easily-deployed theme park of interactive licensed characters is surely appealing to plenty of brands once the kinks are worked out. The goal, as it’s always been with AI, isn’t to make <em>good</em> stuff, or even <em>better</em> stuff; it’s just to make <em>more.</em></p><p>Sweeney’s right that there’s no unpressing the AI button; companies are going to make these things until the bottom falls out. Epic’s demo is just <a href="https://aftermath.site/ai-npcs-nvidia-unity-ubisoft-convai-inworld" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">one more</a> uninspiring bit of buzzwordery to add to the pile. &nbsp;</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/witcher-4-kelpie"><h3>I Am Going To Do Right By The Witcher 4’s New Horse</h3></a><p>A new horse is too much pressure for me, a noted Witcher failure</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/elden-ring-nightreign-starter-guide"><h3>What You Should Know Before Starting Elden Ring Nightreign</h3></a><p>Elden Ring Nightreign is condensed and fast paced, so here's some tips from our friends at Big Friendly Guide.</p><div><div><p><span><span>Ryan Gilliam</span><span> and </span></span><span><span>Jeffrey Parkin</span></span></p></div><p><span>May 30, 2025</span></p></div></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/aftermath-hours-parrying-clair-obscur-ea"><h3>It’s Never Too Late To Talk About A Video Game</h3></a><p>It's also never too late to have *obviously correct* opinions about video game mechanics</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/aaa-gaming-veterans-found-two-new-studios-called-giant-skull-and-emptyvessel/">Empty Vessel</a>, the studio founded by former id Software developers and comprised of people who've worked on Doom, The Last of Us, Call of Duty, Borderlands, Uncharted, and more, has just closed out its series A round of funding for its debut project, DEFECT, with&nbsp;<strong>$11 million</strong> total raised from this round.</p>
<p>The additional funds will allow Empty Vessel to expand the team, per a <a href="https://www.gamespress.com/en-US/emptyvessel-Expands-DEFECT-Game-Development-with-Series-A-Close">press release</a>, and scale to the point where they can work on bringing DEFECT to consoles, and add support for single-player experiences on top of DEFECT already being a multiplayer-focused game.</p>
<p>When we last heard about DEFECT and Empty Vessel, it was with news that NCSOFT had made "<em>a strategic equity investment</em>" in the studio to help DEFECT get out the door, so it's no surprise that NCSOFT was one of the companies that led this series A round of funding, alongside 1AM Gaming, and Black Phoenix Games.</p>
<p><iframe title="DEFECT | Official Reveal Trailer (Unreal In Engine) | Wishlist Now" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/IScUN3ZYeR8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>"<em>It's gratifying to see our developer-first approach resonating with fans and our new long-term partners at NCSOFT alongside our other investors</em>," said chief executive officer at Empty Vessel and game director on DEFECT, Emmanuel Palalic.</p>
<p>"<em>We remain committed to our vision of creating a new genre in the FPS market with DEFECT, and while we are building in a sustainable manner, this new investment will allow us to accelerate our plans for proper single-player support and to expand onto more platforms</em>."</p>
<p>For NCSOFT, the chief executive officer of NC America, and chief operating officer of NC West, Jeonghee 'JJ' Jin added "<em>Empty Vessel's distinct vision for game design, production, and player interaction made us quick believers in their upcoming shooter, DEFECT. We're committed to the evolution and future of this incredible game</em>."</p>
<p>1AM Gaming's managing director, Gregory Milken added "<em>We believe that Empty Vessel is a unique studio working on an amazing game, so we are thrilled to join them as a key investor as they work towards bringing a fresh perspective for first person shooter games with DEFECT</em>."</p>

" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>The Mix Summer Showcase ran over 90 minutes and offered quick looks at dozens of upcoming games. Formerly known as Guerrilla Collective, the showcase is one of many indie events swirling around the orbit of Summer Game Fest, and unlike many of the bigger games getting shown off in the days ahead, some of these have playable demos right now while others are likely getting them in the weeks and months ahead. </p><p>We picked out nine that caught our eye. Some of them were being shown for the first time. Others were previously revealed but had gone under our radar since, or popped up with fresh trailers showing a deeper look at story, world-building, and gameplay. But there were a ton more games worth checking out and wishlisting in the full showcase. You can see all of them for yourself in the video below. </p></div></div><div><p>The most intriguing reveal was a tactical RPG from a small studio called Hypersect led by a former <em>Destiny</em> sandbox gameplay engineer, an <em>Octopath Traveler </em>monster artist, and the composer of <em>Enter the Gungeon</em>. <em>Never’s End</em>’s pitch? <em>Final Fantasy Tactics</em> collides with city management as you raise an army of possessed warriors to protect the last human settlement from a magical apocalypse. There’s no release date yet but it’s coming to PC and PlayStation. </p></div><div><p> <em>Airframe Ultra</em> looks like <em>Wipeout</em> meets <em>Twisted Metal</em>. It’s got a slick PS1 presentation and a gritty vibe that would fit right at home on a long-lost demo disc. It’s the newest project from<em> Rain World </em>maker Videocult so it will probably be uncompromising in every way. </p></div><div><p>Rig dice to beat evil billionaires at their own deranged games. That’s the basic premise of <em>Dead Finger Dice</em>, a point-and-click roguelike about gambling with ghouls and trying to escape the yacht they’ve imprisoned you on. It’s giving <em>Inscryption</em> meets<em> Cryptmaster</em> if they were made in MS-DOS. A survival horror spin on <em>Balatro</em>? Let’s go. </p></div><div><p>The gardenvania subgrene expands with Beauty Cult’s <em>Nectarmancer</em>, a gorgeous-looking action platformer that doubles as a farming sim. Grow crops and fight in tight 2D spaces as you try to take down The Throne, a mysterious cabal exploiting the world’s resources for its own gain. Here’s the line from the Steam page that sold me: “Use a network of plants and their latent nectarmancy to build up a planet-scale biological research computer to acquire even more nectar.” Yes. Yes I will. </p></div><div><p>At first glance I thought <em>Critterrupters</em> was an<em> Animal Crossing</em> clone but it’s actually more like<em> Pokémon</em>. Go from 3D exploration to 2D turn-based augmented reality battles with a focus on interrupting your opponent’s attack to gain an advantage. There’s over 100  Critter Chips to collect, train, and “puzzle out” with the goal of defeating gym leaders and meeting the creator of the virtual Tamagotchi-based warriors. </p></div><div><p>Motorslice is an atmospheric parkour adventure in which you wall-run and slash your way through a futuristic construction site with the vibe of <em>Shadow of the Colossus</em> inside a mega city. Think indie, PS2-era <em>Mirror’s Edge</em> with a sword and heavy machinery boss fights. There’s a bit of a Tarkovskian undertone. <em>Prince of Persia</em> is also an influence according to the developers. Should I just keep name-dropping cool stuff?</p></div><div><p>A boomer shooter segment near the end of the showcase included a bunch of experimental first-person shooters, but <em>Moros Protocol</em> has been in production for five years and is the one that stuck out to me. The sci-fi roguelike combines <em>Doom </em>and <em>Dark Souls</em> for a low-poly fever dream that supports co-op. “And yes, you can kick your enemies,” the devs write. </p></div><div><p><em>Nocturne </em>is a story-focused JRPG that uses rhythm gameplay for its combat. <em>Rock Paper Shotgun</em> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/chrono-trigger-meets-guitar-hero-was-not-on-my-bingo-card-but-ill-take-it-regardless&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/chrono-trigger-meets-guitar-hero-was-not-on-my-bingo-card-but-ill-take-it-regardless" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">likened it to</a></span> “<em>Chrono Trigger</em> meets <em>Guitar Hero</em>.” It might not end up an all-time classic like those, but the pixel art and soundtrack are pretty neat. What’s it about? “Your consciousness was uploaded to a world where a sentient AI has taken control, twisted creatures roam the land, and a vast corruption spreads.” An increasingly relatable predicament!</p></div><div><p><em>Monsters are Coming! Rock &amp; Road </em>mixes and matches elements from lots of popular genres, including city builders and arcade-y bullet hell grindfests. The neat thing here is that the city you grow travels around and turns into a weapon itself, unleashing hell in <em>Vampire Survivors</em>-style horde mode onslaughts. There’s a closed beta happening later this summer. <br></p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/holstin-5-reasons-to-play-this-phenomenal-pixel-art-survival-horror-game<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">I don’t think I’ve hungered for a game this year as much as Holstin. This survival-horror immediately caught my eye with its gorgeous pixel art, perspective-shifting gameplay, and eerie Polish setting.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So I felt super lucky to get hands-on with an all-new, two-hour PC demo, sliced right out of Holstin’s ominous beginnings. While the previous Steam demo captured Holstin’s “feel” through mocked-up puzzles and a firing-range weapons tutorial, this new build puts it all together with a meaty (pun intended) story. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">My friends, you’ve gotta keep an eye on Holstin – here are a few reasons why.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Holstin Screenshots</h3></div></output><h3 data-cy="title3">#1: “Disgusting” Has Never Looked So Good</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s the first thing you’ll notice – Holstin is really, really good-looking, right from your sudden drop into a dilapidated train station overgrown with some weird, pulsing yellow substance. The art looks already great in screenshots, but you need to see and feel Holstin in motion to truly understand what an accomplishment these graphics are. Even the title screen is amazing.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Even the title screen is amazing.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">What looks like 2D top-down pixel art becomes truly impressive 3D once you learn that you can move the camera around, with slick, seamless transitions through eight different angles. Even if you’re aware of this before you begin playing, swinging around for the first time is honestly one of Holstin’s most surprising moments – yes, right up there with enemy encounters!</p><p data-cy="paragraph">(As a side note, the top-down movement in Holstin lends itself really well to twin-stick action on a controller, but it plays perfectly on mouse and keyboard as well.)</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Holstin Demo Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">While most players won't necessarily be choosing Holstin because of its technical proficiency, it’s what really makes this aesthetic work. There’s a reason why graphics like this aren’t manifold in the industry – it’s built on the studio’s custom in-house technology, which makes it likely to cement Holstin as a standout game graphically.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">#2: Mind-Blowing Perspectives</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Okay, so you can spin that third-person, top-down camera around and view the world from multiple angles – but that’s not just an awesome-looking gimmick. Those angles go hand-in-hand with Holstin’s environmental puzzles. If you’re not looking behind boxes or checking around corners to find alleys, you may – and probably will – miss things that will help you find your path forward in Holstin’s strange world. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">But wait! There’s more! </p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are aggressive mutated people everywhere. That means you need to shoot them. But unlike other twin-stick shooters, you won’t be staying in that fixed-camera view to ready your sights. Entering aim mode transitions you into an over-the-shoulder third-person view, freeing your camera to enable pinpoint precision for your headshots.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">These two very different views really add to the suspense – for instance, while in top-down view, you might miss the enemy lurking quietly around a corner. I found myself constantly on my guard, switching between both viewpoints even out of combat. (And sometimes even that didn’t save me from being pounced on and grappled down by some grisly horror of a human.) The only part of combat that initially confused me was melee, as that isn’t in aim mode – but I got used to it quickly.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Holstin plays with other camera perspectives too, though more for atmosphere than for gameplay reasons. Think: a god’s-eye view in an eerily silent, unpopulated area. Your cursor disappears, suddenly removing your primary sense of defense. You might not be switching into aim mode here, but you’ll sure feel like some ominous force is watching your every move.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">#3: Meat, Tentacles, and Gore Galore</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Survival horror fans will want to know how gruesome the strange environment can get, but don’t worry – the squelchy mainstays of the genre are definitely represented in Holstin. The overall goal in this demo is to find your way to a slaughterhouse, after all. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The town’s dissolution into its kind of otherworld first emerges in the form of “Plasmodium,” the aforementioned yellow substance. At first, it looks like someone went wild with foam spray – but when you approach, tentacles will rise and wiggle at you. Are they saying hi or taunting you? Either way, it’s suitably icky and adds to a pervading sense of unease.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And then there are the mutant enemies. Imagine glowing orange orbs taking over your body, their tendrils taking the place of your tendons. Imagine those same orbs buried in the Plasmodium, which slowly spreads through streets and parks like an aggressive, menacing fungus.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Something I also found unsettling was the implied gore. While you don’t see the actual slaughterhouse in this demo, you will learn how it figures into the overall narrative through conversational dialogue and scribbled scraps scattered through the world. Something wicked is going on in that place, and you know it’s not going to be pretty when you finally get there.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">#4: Adventure Gaming Puzzles That Don’t Suck</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">As a gamer who grew up with classic point-and-click adventures, I was very impressed by Holstin’s approach to its puzzles. Maybe I’m getting old and crotchety, but I’ve been disappointed in recent years with how linear puzzling has become in adventure-adjacent games. Receive an objective, figure out how to solve the objective, then receive the next objective. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Figuring out which are solvable in any given moment is almost a puzzle in itself.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Though Holstin is strongly narrative-driven, it never feels like a linear story with disparate puzzles slapped on top. In fact, I’d almost forgotten how challenging a well-designed puzzle tree can be. In Holstin, you won’t be completing objectives in the order they’re listed. You can work on multiple objectives at once, and figuring out which are solvable in any given moment is almost a puzzle in itself. You might have to retrace your steps, which feels realistic (like searching your house thrice for your car keys).</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">And as for the puzzles themselves – they make sense (well, as much as something can make sense in this mad world). Survival horror fans are all familiar with some of the genre’s most inane challenges – ranging from the dreaded sliding puzzle through to needing an intimate knowledge of Shakespeare to shelve books correctly in order to obtain a door code (*cough* Silent Hill *cough*). </p><p data-cy="paragraph">None of that nonsense here. Holstin’s asks of you are simple: How are you going to get this trapdoor open? What twisting path through town will you need to forge in order to reach the playground? How you solve these problems feels organic, and really encourages you to explore your environs thoroughly.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">#5: 1990s Poland Is a Trip</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">The Polish setting forms the bones of quite a specific – and unique – narrative. It’s not exactly a great tourism ad for Poland, but even covered with the weird tentacled Plasmodium, the town of Jeziorne-Kolonia still feels like a distinctly foreign experience compared to other games set in more vague locations.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">This demo only has Polish voiceover, and as an English speaker myself, I found that this added to the believability and atmosphere – like watching a foreign flick. Though I don’t have the context of how the Polish language is structured, the voice acting sounded dead-on. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">There’s the suicidal woman, her voice filled with defeat as she hands her gun over to you. The large, childlike man, squealing, talking in riddles, and just one plot twist away from losing it entirely. The cast of weirdos here is a lot wider than your usual survival-horror game – but their convincing creepiness doesn’t detract from the suspense at all. (I sure wished they would help me out in combat, though.)</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">And while Holstin set in the 1990s, it’s not exactly boy bands and GeoCities. For instance, your save checkpoints are decrepit-looking phone booths – and you’ll need to find physical telephone cards to actually make your save (just like the real-life anachronism of digging for change to do your laundry). Our hero Tomasz definitely does not have a cell phone for tracking objectives. Expect all the inconveniences in the pre-internet era – yet another stumbling block in your strange journey through this horrifying town.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">All in all, this demo honestly blew me away – and I say that very rarely of any game. If the rest of Holstin is as polished and carefully crafted, it will be considered a survival horror classic in a decade’s time. I’m that impressed by what I’ve seen and played of it so far.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

In essence, the CIA appears to have operated sites like starwarsweb.net (check out <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20101230033220/http://starwarsweb.net/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">the Wayback Machine's snapshot from 2010</a>) as shells that hid tools designed to enable covert communication. </p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1539/15391776/4505631-screenshot2025-06-03at2.31.46%E2%80%AFpm.png" data-ref-id="1300-4505631" data-ratio="0.74665293511843" data-width="1942" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1539/15391776/4505631-screenshot2025-06-03at2.31.46%E2%80%AFpm.png" data-ref-id="1300-4505631"></a><figcaption>The homepage of starwarsweb.net, via the Wayback Machine. </figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1539/15391776/4505631-screenshot2025-06-03at2.31.46%E2%80%AFpm.png"></figure><p>Researchers like Santilli have been able to explore and characterize this network of sites due to a series of technical missteps by the CIA. For instance, <a href="https://www.404media.co/the-cia-secretly-ran-a-star-wars-fan-site/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">as described in 404 Media's reporting</a>, many of the websites had sequential IP addresses, and related sites were easily revealed through basic DNS lookup services. In addition to starwarsweb.net, the CIA also appears to have created multiple gaming-focused websites. Among these are <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110207193330/http://havenofgamerz.com/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">havenofgamerz.com</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110202125821/http://activegaminginfo.com/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">activegaminginfo.com</a>, and <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110209004241/http://myonlinegamesource.com/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">myonlinegamingsource.com</a> (all links to Wayback Machine snapshots). </p><p>The CIA's website network was revealed in <a href="https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/usa-spies-iran/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">a Reuters report from 2022</a> to be at the center of a disastrous intelligence failure that resulted in a number of informants and sources being compromised. The Reuters story focused in particular on how Iran's regime was able to identify informants by uncovering the CIA's communications channels hidden in Iranian-focused websites. The information provided in this report--including names and screenshots of wesbites--gave Santilli the traces he needed to dig into the larger network. </p><p>The intelligence operation was extensive, targeting many different countries throughout the world, and the processes to research the operation after the fact have been even more complex. If you're interested in learning more about the investigation, I highly recommend checking out 404's article, which includes more detail from Santilli himself. </p>

            <p>
Last week, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/sorry-mindseye-even-with-your-first-actual-gameplay-trailer-i-still-dont-believe-youre-a-real-game">I questioned whether MindsEye was a real game or not</a>. This week, that question lingers. Why, you ask? Well, as spotted by our good friends over at <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mindseye-studio-execs-depart-build-a-rocket-boy-one-week-before-games-debut">Eurogamer</a>, two executives at the studio behind the game, Build a Rocket Boy, have now departed the company. Let me just check when <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mindseye">MindsEye</a> is coming out… oh, that's right, literally one week from today. Surely this is only good news!
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
In a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/riley-graebner-0464378_after-three-and-a-half-years-my-time-at-barb-activity-7335325435200761858-TbDN/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAADDOgdoB1gzNggnuaGLIXM_FUprl3u0285o">LinkedIn post</a> from yesterday, now former chief legal officer Riley Graebner shared news of his departure after three and a half years at the company, saying he was "proud" of what the team has accomplished in that time. Former chief financial officer Paul Bland doesn't seem to have made an announcement of his exit per se, but the experience section of his own <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/paul-b-b7410313/">LinkedIn account</a> lists his time at Build a Rocket Boy as ending in June (typically roles listed on LinkedIn will say "present" if a person is still at the company).
</p>
<p>
Now, I don't know about you, but two executives leaving a studio, no matter their position, doesn't scream "incoming success story." There could be any myriad of reasons as to why they've left of course, this is just speculation, the timing is just a bit odd so close to release for such high level positions.
</p>
<p>
Thus far hardly any actual gameplay of MindsEye has been shown off, though publisher IO Interactive did announce a showcase for this Friday, June 6th, where more of it will be shown off. Will it be overshadowed by IO's own James Bond game that's also getting a proper look-in, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/007-first-light-is-the-new-james-bond-game-from-hitman-makers-io-interactive">now revealed to be called 007 First Light</a>? Almost certainly, but at least there might be more than five minutes of gameplay this time around.

                <p>After many years without the beloved game type, Grifball is finally debuting in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/halo-infinite/" data-ref-id="5000-483351">Halo Infinite</a>. Microsoft has announced that an official version of the 4 vs. 4 football-like game is launching on June 10, marking the end of a long drought.</p><p>Microsoft announced Grifball's triumphant return in a video posted on X, which you can see embedded below. In an homage to Grifball's roots as a creation of Rooster Teeth and to Machinima culture more broadly, the video features an in-game conversation between two Halo characters (replete with the trademark head-nods that indicate the current speaker).</p><p>This teaser is currently all we know about the Halo Infinite incarnation of Grifball, which is described as a "new era." The fan community has frequently requested an official version of the match type, but to no avail. While developer Halo Studios has not specified exactly <em>why </em>it's taken this long, community speculation suggests that certain differences in Halo Infinite from past games, such as the mechanics of the Gravity Hammer, have caused challenges to Grifball implementation. As such, Grifball has remained playable in recent years only in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/halo-the-master-chief-collection/" data-ref-id="5000-283982">The Master Chief Collection</a>.</p><p>While things have been quiet on the Halo front lately, the developer has continued updating Halo Infinite with new content and game modes. Earlier this year, for instance, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/halo-infinite-brings-back-beloved-co-op-mode/1100-6530079/" data-ref-id="1100-6530079">the beloved co-op mode Firefight Classic</a> was added to Infinite; last month, the game got <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/halo-infinite-is-adding-one-of-halos-most-absurd-and-incredible-looking-guns-to-date/1100-6531297/" data-ref-id="1100-6531297">a particularly absurd gun called the Mutilator</a>.</p><p>It's still probably too early to get any announcements about upcoming Halo games--don't hold your breath for Halo reveals at <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-games-showcase-announced-for-june-8-heres-what-to-expect/1100-6530713/" data-ref-id="1100-6530713">the Xbox showcase</a> at <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/summer-game-fest/">Summer Games Fest</a>--but Halo Studies is working on new titles. Late last year, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-halo-games-project-foundry-unreal-engine-5-when-to-expect-them/1100-6527083/" data-ref-id="1100-6527083">Halo Studios provided an overview for its long-term roadmap</a>, sharing that several new Halo entries are in the works, and they'll all use Unreal Engine 5.</p>

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/first-details-emerge-on-upcoming-dungeons-dragons-video-game/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Demeo x DUNGEONS &amp; DRAGONS: Battlemarked</a>, a digital fantasy tabletop adventure game set in the Forgotten Realms, will be released later this year for PC, PlayStation 5, and VR (<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3124340/Demeo_x_Dungeons__Dragons_Battlemarked/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SteamVR</a>, Meta Horizon, PSVR2). The news came today from developer Resolution Games, which previously made Demeo. Compared to that game, though, the D&amp;D licensed game will feature more narrative.</p>
<p>Tommy Palm, founder and CEO of Resolution Games, said in a statement:</p>
<p><em>While the world of Demeo is rich with lore, our previous titles focus primarily on tactical action over motivation and narrative. With DUNGEONS &amp; DRAGONS, story is just as important as combat, so we’ve rebalanced our approach to make sure we can deliver more of it. With the addition of dramatic cut scenes, richer dialogue, and deeper player choices, Battlemarked truly marks the start of the next iteration of the Demeo Action Roleplaying System.</em></p>
<p>To improve in this area, Resolution Games hired legendary story designer Matt Sernett as the project’s narrative lead. Sernett previously worked as a designer for the DUNGEONS &amp; DRAGONS tabletop game and contributed to DUNGEONS &amp; DRAGONS video games such as the classics Baldur’s Gate, Baldur’s Gate II, and Icewind Dale. More recently, he contributed to the narrative of Bungie's Destiny 2.</p>
<p>Matt Sernett added:</p>
<p><em>When DUNGEONS &amp; DRAGONS launched the fifth edition back in 2014, the first adventure that many players went on ventured into Neverwinter Wood, and I can think of no place better for Battlemarked players to begin their journey. The first adventure in Demeo x DUNGEONS &amp; DRAGONS: Battlemarked will take players to familiar locations including Cragmaw Castle and Mount Hotenow. The world of D&amp;D is just as much a part of the story as its characters, and we can’t wait for players to immerse themselves in its dangers and delights.</em></p>
<p>Just yesterday, we <a href="https://wccftech.com/wizards-of-the-coast-signs-deal-with-former-god-of-war-directors-new-studio-giant-skull-to-make-a-single-player-action-dd-based-game/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">learned</a> of another D&amp;D licensed game in development at Giant Skull, the new studio founded by former God of War and Star Wars Jedi director Stig Asmussen. That game will be a single player action/adventure title.</p>

In celebration of the global tabletop company's 30th anniversary, its new global rebrand will be consumer-focused, as represented in its new tagline: "inspired by players."</p>

<h2>The Asmodee Global Rebrand</h2>

<p>According to an official press release, the rebrand is intended to mark a key milestone in strengthening the company's direct relationship with players, while reinforcing its reputation for quality.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/asmodee-catan-artwork.jpg?itok=ril2Ln1g 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/asmodee-catan-artwork.jpg?itok=bSi7wf_c 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Asmodee, was formed in 1995 and is a massive pillar in the tabletop industry. They have published hundreds of games across hundreds of beloved IPs. Releases such as <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/asmodee-group-announces-catan-sixth-edition-is-out-now" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Catan</em></a>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/ticket-to-ride-europe-15th-anniversary-edition-review" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Ticket to Ride</em></a>, <em>7 Wonders</em>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/arkham-horror-roleplaying-game-core-rulebook-review-this-is-halloween" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Arkham Horror</em></a>, <em>Marvel: Crisis Protocol</em>, <em>Twilight Imperium</em>, and many more. In addition, they have many board game companies under their umbrella, a strategy they <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/asmodee-group-eyes-buying-out-board-game-companies-again" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">still use today</a>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>"At asmodee, we have made it our mission to create meaningful, shared experiences through our games to celebrate all players” says Thomas Kœgler, CEO of asmodee. “During our 30-year journey in the tabletop games industry, our brand hasn’t always been visible to players themselves. With this brand evolution, we aim to change that—making asmodee a name that’s recognized, trusted, loved, and sought out by players around the world.”&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The rebrand may also be a way of getting a fresh start after departing from Embracer Group. Embracer Group separated <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/embracer-group-splitting-three-companies" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">into three companies</a> last year after a string of acquisitions and deals fell through. Embracer has now been rebranded <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/embracer-fellowship-entertainment-coffee-stain" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Fellowship Entertainment</a>, named after its acquisition of <em>The Lord of the Rings</em> IP, and another of its studios, Coffee Stain Studios, is also spinning off.</p>

<p>Asmodee remains an active part of the tabletop industry through multiple program initiatives. These include their <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/asmodees-game-in-lab-program-provides-eu20000-for-board-game-research-projects" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Game in Lab</a> program, which provides grants to scientific research projects related to board games, and distribution deals with indie studios such as <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/asmodee-usa-signs-distribution-deal-with-gray-matters-games" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Gray Matter Games</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/games/678895/the-witcher-4-ue5-tech-demo-ps5-interview<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Arguably the highlight of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/677653/epic-games-unreal-fest-2025-orlando-news-announcements">Epic’s State of Unreal keynote</a> was the opening:<a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/678463/unreal-engine-5-witcher-4-tech-demo"> a sprawling technical demo that showed just how good <em>The Witcher 4</em> looks in Unreal Engine 5</a>. It showcased a bustling market in a port city, a beautiful forest landscape, and a horse that looked and acted like, well, a horse. Even more impressive was the fact that the demo was running at 60 frames per second on a base model PlayStation 5. According to Julius Girbig, a senior technical animator at Witcher developer CD Projekt Red, the choice of hardware for the demo was very intentional.</p><p>“Everyone has the idea of how fast a PS5 is and what kinds of games it can run,” he tells <em>The Verge</em>. “That’s why we specifically wanted to go that route of: let’s start with the consoles, let’s show how much we can optimize this engine together with Epic and make it work on current gen, instead of running it on some high-end hardware.”</p><p>Now, to be clear, the UE5 demo is not actually a slice of the final game. Girbig describes it as “a demonstration of the tools that we are currently building that will eventually power <em>The Witcher 4</em>,” and something that “does show the style and direction that we’re going for, and the fidelity that we’re aiming at with the final game.”</p><div><p>But whatever it ends up being, and whenever it launches, <em>The Witcher 4</em> will be a pivotal release for CDPR. After previously creating open-world games like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/12/12/23505545/the-witcher-3-next-gen-update-ps5-xbox-pc-hands-on"><em>The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt</em></a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22157995/cyberpunk-2077-cd-projekt-red-review-xbox-ps4-ps5-pc-stadia"><em>Cyberpunk 2077</em></a> with its own proprietary engine — sometimes with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/12/22/22195728/cyberpunk-2077-sales-copies-sold-launch-refunds">technically disastrous results</a> —<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/3/21/22989313/cd-projekt-red-new-witcher-game-unreal-engine-5-announcement">the studio announced in 2022 that it was switching to Unreal</a>.</p></div><p>According to Girbig, who didn’t work at CDPR until after the shift to Unreal, the decision was made because UE5 “across the board, gives us what we’re looking for.” That includes an increased sense of scale necessary for open-world games, with the ability to render hundreds of non-playable characters with more elaborate AI guiding their actions, and also a better production pipeline for managing multiple projects. (<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/10/26/23424463/witcher-remake-cd-projekt-red-unreal-engine-5">An upcoming remake of the first <em>Witcher</em> game is also being made in UE5</a>.)</p><p>But from an artistic perspective, Girbig says, the move to Epic’s engine has a different kind of impact: getting out of the way to allow for more ambitious ideas. “It allows an artist to express themselves much more easily when the engine isn’t a limitation anymore,” he says. “That’s what we’re aiming for here. As an artist, for me, this unlocked myself to think bigger, and on bigger scales.”</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/clair-obscur-expedition-33-gustave-act-one<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>When <em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 </em>first came out, some people – <a href="https://aftermath.site/clair-obscur-nathan-tips" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">mainly my colleagues</a> – made the dubious claim that main character Gustave looks like me. I disputed this on multiple occasions, but as I’ve made my way through the game <a href="https://aftermath.site/clair-obscur-expedition-33-story-mode-difficulty-tips" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">at a leisurely pace</a>, a funny thing has happened: Because other people see Gustave as my doppelganger, I’ve come to view him as my unfalteringly kind son (who’s only a couple years younger than me). Humans are vain creatures, so I’ve developed a unique attachment to the British-accented Frenchman who sports my hair and Robert Pattinson’s face. Or at least, that <em>was </em>the case until…</p><p><strong>SPOILERS FOR A MAJOR CLAIR OBSCUR TWIST FOLLOW. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED! TWICE!&nbsp;&nbsp;</strong></p><p>…Renoir killed the shit out of him!</p><p>If I’m being honest, I kind of saw it coming. Gustave’s skill tree was oddly limited compared to other party members, and the end of Act One started leaning into ominousness and sentimentality a little too hard for my liking. As soon as Gustave and Maelle decided to take a break from their all-important mission to indulge in the ancient Lumierian sport of rock throwing, I knew his fate was sealed.&nbsp;</p><p>But still, it was not a clean, dignified death! Renoir fucked my boy up. Gustave died gasping and confused, with his bloodshot eyes and gore-spewing wound rendered in exquisite detail. He went down fighting – and even somberly uttered his catchphrase, “For those who come after,” one last time – but other than that, he met nearly the same end as many of his Expedition 33 compatriots on the beach near the start of the game. He just got to go a few steps further.</p><p>I’ve watched plenty of TV, movie, and video game characters die brutally. It was something slightly different to watch a “me” die. From certain angles, I could almost copy-paste my own features onto Gustave’s haggard visage. I could see myself getting sliced, diced, and put down like a puppy who’d ventured into the wrong backyard. It was unnerving.&nbsp;</p><p>On top of that, I would <em>so </em>go out that way. Not necessarily standing my ground to protect a loved one, but by getting absolutely trucked before ever learning the truth of why everything is so messed up. I’m the kind of person who yelps in a comically surprised fashion any time I walk into something or get touched unexpectedly. I take far too many risks for someone who’s generally un-graceful. I always want to know why things are the way they are – and have been known to take the aforementioned risks in service of that – but I can’t say my ventures always pan out. In short, I am destined to die on the most consequential day in human history, as the result of a largely unrelated piano being dropped on my head. My final words will be “Hey, what’s that?” Or perhaps simply “Oh.”</p><p>That’s a death befitting an NPC, which makes sense for someone like myself, famously Just A Guy. Gustave was a hero, albeit an unsuccessful one, and so he died the modern, gritty version of a hero’s death. What has stuck with me more, arguably, is the way Maelle, Lune, and Sciel mourn him in Act Two, spending multiple scenes reminiscing about his life and making peace with his passing, comforting each other all the way through. The culmination of this – a legitimately touching burial facilitated by Act Two’s guy with hair kinda like mine, Verso – is the sort of tender expression of grief that I wish more games were narratively deft enough to pull off. We spend so much time dealing death in games that it’s hard not to feel numb when, say, Naoe from <em>Assassin’s Creed </em>grapples with the consequences of her actions after 10 or 20 hours of wholesale slaughter. Comparatively, we spend very little time dealing <em>with </em>death.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Life, on the other hand, tends to involve much more of the latter than the former – at least until your time comes. I guess if nothing else, I’d like to hope my loved ones end up remembering me as fondly as Gustave’s did and being united by both my presence and lack thereof. That’s all any of us can really ask for. &nbsp;</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/witcher-4-kelpie"><h3>I Am Going To Do Right By The Witcher 4’s New Horse</h3></a><p>A new horse is too much pressure for me, a noted Witcher failure</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/elden-ring-nightreign-starter-guide"><h3>What You Should Know Before Starting Elden Ring Nightreign</h3></a><p>Elden Ring Nightreign is condensed and fast paced, so here's some tips from our friends at Big Friendly Guide.</p><div><div><p><span><span>Ryan Gilliam</span><span> and </span></span><span><span>Jeffrey Parkin</span></span></p></div><p><span>May 30, 2025</span></p></div></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/aftermath-hours-parrying-clair-obscur-ea"><h3>It’s Never Too Late To Talk About A Video Game</h3></a><p>It's also never too late to have *obviously correct* opinions about video game mechanics</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Actor Jonathan Joss, who had voice-acted in a number of high-profile video games, was killed this week outside his home in an attack that his husband has alleged was a homophobic hate crime. He was 59 years old and leaves behind a legacy of roles across television, movies, and games.</p><p>Joss, who was of Comanche and White Mountain Apache descent, provided his voice for numerous games across his career. According to <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0430885/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">his IMDB page</a>, Joss had roles in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/red-dead-redemption/" data-ref-id="5000-42031">Red Dead Redemption</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-walking-dead-michonne-a-telltale-miniseries/" data-ref-id="5000-438500">The Walking Dead: Michonne</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/days-gone/" data-ref-id="5000-455389">Days Gone</a>, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/wasteland-3/" data-ref-id="5000-458193">Wasteland 3</a>. He also provided the voice for Robert Rainwater, a ripperdoc in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/cyberpunk-2077/" data-ref-id="5000-143160">Cyberpunk 2077</a>.</p><p>Outside of games, he was best known for his roles as indigenous characters in television comedies. Between 1997-2007, he played John Redcorn on King of the Hill; later, he appeared in several episodes of Parks and Recreation as casino magnate and tribal chief Ken Hotate.</p><p><i>Warning: sensitive and potentially disturbing details about Joss's death are discussed below</i>.</p><p>Joss was shot dead on June 1, 2025, at his house in San Antonio, TX. He had just married his husband, Tristan Kern de Gonzales, on Valentine's Day earlier this year. After Joss's death, de Gonzales asserted that Joss was the victim of an anti-gay attack by a neighbor, who was described as yelling homophobic slurs at the couple. De Gonzales relayed how they returned to their home, which had previously burnt down, to check their mail, and they discovered remains of one of their dogs had been placed "in clear view." Expressing sadness and despair, the couple was confronted by the neighbor who opened fire, de Gonzales stated.</p><p>De Gonazles shared that the couple had faced homophobic harassment in their neighborhood for an extended period of time, and their reports to law enforcement had received no response. The San Antonio police <a href="https://abc7.com/post/jonathan-joss-killed-san-antonio-shooting-police-sayknown-character-king-hill-tulsa-parks-rec/16637058/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">has responded</a> that it has not found any evidence to charge the suspect with a hate crime, and <a href="https://www.wfaa.com/article/news/local/cried-wolf-nothing-done-king-hill-actor-jonathan-joss-pitchfork-neighbors/273-2d9d7e2c-b5fd-42af-97aa-570f6a4a55e3" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">neighbors have shared</a> that Joss and the suspect had a years-long feud that had gone unresolved.</p><p>Many actors who worked with Joss in the past have been outspoken in their sadness about his passing. Nick Offerman, who played Ron Swanson on Parks and Recreation, told <a href="https://people.com/nick-offerman-parks-and-recreation-cast-texting-about-jonathan-joss-death-all-day-11746985" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">People Magazine</a> that the other actors from the sitcom extensively discussed and supported each other in the aftermath of the tragic events.</p>

                <p>Not much is known about the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mass-effect-5-everything-we-know-about-bioware-upcoming-rpg/1100-6485779/" data-ref-id="1100-6485779">next Mass Effect game</a>, but producer Mike Gamble has now shared a small morsel of news regarding a feature that may return for the next entry: lens flare.</p><p>Posting on social media, Gamble used the "OK" emoji in response to a fan who said, "Mass Effect 5 better stick to tradition and have an excessive amount of lens flare."</p><p>The Mass Effect series is known for its creative and frequent use of lens flare, which is a filmmaking technique popularized by Hollywood directors like JJ Abrams and Steven Spielberg. Obviously a video game does not use a physical camera like a Hollywood movie might, but games like Mass Effect are known to embrace lens flare for dramatic and stylistic effect.</p><p>Gamble's emoji response is not total confirmation of anything at all, but it's a strong suggestion that this one feature from past games may return. Given how silent BioWare has been about the game so far, fans are looking for any piece of news they can get their hands on.</p><p>With no expansions planned for Dragon Age: The Veilguard, BioWare's developers are now turning their attention to the next Mass Effect game. There is no word yet, however, on when the game may be released--so far, BioWare has <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bioware-teases-mass-effect-5-with-mysterious-concept-art/1100-6508956/" data-ref-id="1100-6508956">only released a few teasers for it.</a></p><p>In addition to a new Mass Effect game, a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mass-effect-tv-series-first-revealed-in-2021-is-apparently-back-on-with-a-key-update/1100-6527637/" data-ref-id="1100-6527637">Mass Effect TV series is said to be in the works at Amazon MGM Studios</a>, the same outfit that's behind the upcoming <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sydney-sweeney-starring-split-fiction-movie-from-deadpool-writers-gets-a-key-update/1100-6531988/" data-ref-id="1100-6531988">Split Fiction movie starring Sydney Sweeney.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/06/03/raw-fury-reveal-two-new-games-at-mix-summer-game-showcase/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Raw Fury has revealed two new games at the MIX Summer Game Showcase, with the tower survival action of&nbsp;Monsters are Coming! Rock &amp; Road, and the RPG hack-and-slash adventuring of Regions of Ruin: Runegate.</p>
<p>That’s a lot of R’s.</p>
<p><iframe title="Monsters are Coming! Rock &amp; Road | Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/P33pMKtwmLE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Monsters are Coming! Rock &amp; Road from Ludogram takes a little bit of tower defence, bullet heaven and survival crafting, chucks it all in the pot, and stews up a game where your city on wheels has to keep on rolling down the road while blasting away at swarming hordes of enemies. All the while, your player character can run around gathering resources, while various safe zones give an opportunity for greater resource hauls and major reworks and upgrades to your fortress city.</p>

<p>It’s an intriguing looking game that absolutely feeds off the gaming zeitgeist, but could definitely find a healthy following. The game is available to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2934220/Monsters_are_Coming_Rock__Road/">wishlist on Steam</a>, and you can <a href="https://forms.gle/cGjyaUxZgoQdMgVm6">sign up to the closed beta here</a>.</p>
<p><iframe title="Regions of Ruin: Runegate Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/r7q3I3rdwAE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Regions of Ruin: Runegate from Gameclaw sends your dwarven character off on a side-scrolling hack ‘n’ slasher to explore the shattered realms that were once rules by your people and restore them to their former glory. There’s a nice low detail pixel art style here.</p>
<p>It’s available to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1375750/Regions_of_Ruin_Runegate/">wishlist on Steam today</a>.</p>
<p>Elsehwere, Raw Fury also had new trailers for Craftlings, to mark the release of a demo for the resource management strategy game – <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1771110/Craftlings/">check it out here</a> – and there’s a new intro trailer for Esoteric Ebb, the rather unusual RPG where <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/28/esoteric-ebb-to-be-published-by-raw-fury-become-a-cleric-in-this-crpg/">you play a cleric in a city</a> and have all your decisions affected by the roll of a D20.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Craftlings Gameplay Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/G5JGBSo_T_8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>

data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Killswitch Grip</a> adds ergonomic handles to the Switch 2's Joy-Con Controllers as well as an impact-resistant shell to protect the console from accidental drops. The Switch 2 edition of the Killswitch has a three-piece design that allows you to remove each Joy-Con 2 Controller without the need to remove the textured grips.</p><p>Like other Killswitch grips from Dbrand, the handles have a firm, rubberized feel. The handles are uniquely shaped with a contoured ridge to rest your middle fingers on. The low-profile case covers the back of the console without adding bulk to the top or sides; the casing extends up 2.5mm on the top and sides of the Switch 2. All of the ports are accessible with the case attached, and the console's built-in kickstand can still be used.</p><p>The only caveat here is that, unless you remove the Killswitch, you'll need to use an adapter to dock the console for TV mode. That said, Dbrand is bundling the custom dock adapter stand with the grip.</p><p>Pricing for the Switch 2 edition of the Killswitch starts at $60. At the base tier, you'll get the grip case, dock adapter, and a console skin.</p><p>Dbrand is offering discounts for the higher-priced configurations. The Travel package costs $79.85 (was $99.85) and comes with a front case that protects the Switch 2's display and buttons, sticks, and triggers while on the go. With the front cover attached, the Killswitch will fully replace a traditional carrying case. This tier also includes a 10-card game case that attaches to the inside of the travel cover, as well as textured thumbstick grips.</p><p>The Ultra package is now $99.80 (was $134.80) and includes everything from the Travel bundle, as well as two Dbrand Prism 2.0 tempered glass screen protectors with an auto-alignment application kit. You'll also get an extra game card holder.</p><p>Each of the add-on components is available to purchase separately, but the bundles offer better value. For instance, the travel cover with a game card holder is a $25 (was $30) add-on. Two screen protectors cost $30 (was $35). Meanwhile, the stick grips are $10, and an extra game card holder is $15--though you won't want that last one unless you get the travel cover.</p></div>                      </div><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4505604-dbrandswitch2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4505604" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4505604-dbrandswitch2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4505604"></a><figcaption>Dbrand Nintendo Switch 2 Killswitch</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4505604-dbrandswitch2.jpg"></figure><div data-embed-type="pinbox" data-ref-id="4304">  <ul>                              <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/best-microsd-express-card-deals-nintendo-switch-2-samsung-sandisk-amazon-walmart/1100-6530578/">Walmart Has 512GB Switch 2 MicroSD Express Card For $65</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-restock-launch-week-buying-guide-major-retailers-walmart-target-best-buy/1100-6531967/">Nintendo Switch 2 Launch Week Restocks - Here's What We Know So Far</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstations-dualsense-edge-ps5-controller-is-on-sale-for-its-best-price-yet/1100-6531846/">DualSense Edge PS5 Controller Drops To Best-Ever Price For Days Of Play</a></li>                          <li>         <span>+ Show More More Gaming, Tech, and Entertainment Deals &amp; Preorders Links (5)</span>       </li>          <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ps5-pro-console-best-deal-playstation-days-of-play-2025-sale/1100-6526406/">The PS5 Pro Has Received Its First Discount For Days Of Play 2025</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-last-of-us-season-2-4k-blu-ray-release-limited-edition-steelbook-preorder-amazon-walmart/1100-6531822/">The Last Of Us Season 2 Steelbook Edition 4K Blu-Ray Is Up For Preorder</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-325-lord-of-the-rings-deluxe-illustrated-box-set-is-only-146-for-a-limited-time/1100-6525568/">The $325 Lord Of The Rings Deluxe Illustrated Box Set Is Only $146 For A Limited Time</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/tolkien-collectible-book-sets-are-up-for-preorder-myths-legends-tales-of-middle-earth/1100-6531796/">Tolkien Collectible Book Sets Are Up For Preorder  - Myths, Legends, Tales Of Middle-earth</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/super-mario-bros-1993-movie-30th-anniversary-edition-blu-ray-where-to-watch-buy-amazon/1100-6531622/">Highly Limited Super Mario Bros. 30th Anniversary 4K Blu-Ray In Stock At Amazon</a></li>   </ul> </div>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/two-build-a-rocket-boy-chief-executives-have-left-the-studio-a-week-before-mindseye-launches/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>As spotted by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mindseye-studio-execs-depart-build-a-rocket-boy-one-week-before-games-debut">Eurogamer</a>, two chief executives from Build A Rocket Boy, the studio founded by former Rockstar producer Leslie Benzies, who worked on each Grand Theft Auto game since GTA III, have left the company just a week before the studio's first release, MindsEye, is set to launch.</p>
<p>Chief financial officer Paul Bland quietly confirmed his departure with a quick update to his <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/paul-b-b7410313/">LinkedIn page</a> that his time at Build A Rocket Boy concluded in June 2025, while chief legal officer Riley Graebner announced his departure with a short post on his <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/riley-graebner-0464378_after-three-and-a-half-years-my-time-at-barb-activity-7335325435200761858-TbDN?utm_source=social_share_send&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop_web&amp;rcm=ACoAADTlvBcBPTBRScN2Be454jnla503919DOfI">LinkedIn page</a>, saying "<em>After three and a half years my time at BARB has come to a close. I'm proud of what we've accomplished</em>."</p>
<p>That both of them have left just before MindsEye launches is more just the latest odd thing to be attached to MindsEye's story, than any actual reflection on what we should expect from the game on June 10.</p>
<p>But add that news to the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PS5/comments/1kt8ww4/previews_for_mindseye_by_former_rockstar_games/">less-than-enthusiastic previews </a>the game got, how little we know about the <a href="https://wccftech.com/build-a-rocket-boy-debuts-new-mindseye-trailer-showcases-new-gameplay-and-post-launch-roadmap-details/">game so close to release</a>, reports of the <a href="https://x.com/DetectiveSeeds/status/1929323838656950698">studio not giving out review codes</a>, negative reviews on the studio's internal structure from former employees on <a href="https://www.glassdoor.ca/Reviews/Build-a-Rocket-Boy-Reviews-E2397452.htm?filter.iso3Language=eng">Glassdoor</a>, and the studio's co-chief executive officer claiming that any negative attention the game is a result of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mindseye-boss-claims-games-negative-reaction-ahead-of-release-has-been-paid-for-in-concerted-effort-against-studio">someone financially investing in a campaign to tarnish the studio's name</a>, and it all strikes as a bit more than odd.</p>
<p>Of course, the game could still come out next week and be amazing, but these departures are leading players in the game's official Discord server and on social media to show concern for its launch.</p>
<p><iframe title="Introducing MindsEye - Explainer | 2025" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4s3jVJaFrbM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>MindsEye and Everywhere have always sounded like two incredibly ambitious projects. It would be far more exciting if both games were spectacular, than if they failed to hit their mark. It's far too early to make a call on it yet, if for no other reason than none of us have played it, but it'll be interesting to see what June 10 holds either way.</p>

</div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
Let's start this one with a definition: <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/lethal-company">Lethal Company</a> is "one of those kinda games." By that I mean it's a four player <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-co-op-games">co-op</a> title that doesn't really adhere to a particular genre, predominantly prioritising mechanics that allow you and some friends to get up to some shenanigans. Like <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/content-warning">Content Warning</a>, or REPO, you know, one of those kinda games! Now we've got that out of the way, let me introduce you to Roadside Research, one of those kinda games, except this time you are an incredibly poorly disguised alien running a gas station in order to research humans. See what I mean?
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
It's a delectably silly concept, right down to said disguises literally just being bits of paper taped to the grey (and not grey) aliens' faces. In terms of the moment to moment gameplay, you'll be doing things a perfectly regular human working at a gas station would do: restock shelves, refuel customers' cars, "exchange goods for cash."

<p>
You'll need to cook and clean too, I'm assuming that second one is those hot dogs that roll on those spinning poles you're 100% sure have never been cleaned. Once you've finished a day's work, you can upgrade your gas station - again, a typical human thing to do - to help bring in more people the following day.
</p>
<p>
There's Men in Black-looking government officials to avoid too, for a bit of a threat. Overall it just looks like a silly good time, I'm not massively into online co-op games generally, but this recent trend of comedy online co-op games where there's often not really any violence is certainly appealing to me.
</p>
<p>
Roadside Research doesn't have a release date just yet, but you can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3643170/Roadside_Research/">wishlist it on Steam here</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/tech-experts-say-elden-ring-nightreigns-quality-mode-makes-no-practical-sense-on-any-console<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Performance seems the way to go.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/elden-ring-nightreign">Elden Ring Nightreign</a> shares quite a bit with its predecessor Elden Ring, from its gameplay to its lore and history. It also seems to carry some of its technical nuances, according to a new breakdown from the tech experts at Digital Foundry.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-elden-ring-nightreign-offers-no-technical-progression-and-doesnt-properly-support-ps5-pro" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Digital Foundry</a> published an analysis of the tech details behind FromSoftware's latest, and while Nightreign remixes a lot of what Elden Ring was into something new, it sounds like the state of Nightreign's technology is fairly reminiscent of Elden Ring's.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"This is really nothing new to those familiar with FromSoftware's Elden Ring engine, and how it operates on consoles," wrote Digital Foundry's Thomas Morgan.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Digital Foundry characterized the optimization for PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series consoles as "disappointing," as Nightreign continues to "often fall short of a target 60 frames per second while exploring." Additionally, the tech analyst noted there's no listed support for PlayStation 5 Pro, which bore out in tests, meaning the PS5 Pro is just running the base PS5 code with no additional modes or optimizations.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I recommend visiting <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-elden-ring-nightreign-offers-no-technical-progression-and-doesnt-properly-support-ps5-pro" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Digital Foundry</a> for the full numbers breakdown, as there's quite a bit to go through, but all of it is best summed-up by Morgan here: "Ultimately, using the quality mode makes no practical sense on any console." The base PS5 typically hovers in a lower 30-45 frames per second range in this mode, compared to a 40-60 range on the framerate mode, and the Xbox consoles mirroring similar gaps.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While the PS5 Pro seems to benefit from having a little extra horsepower to run Nightreign, there are still "lurches" while exploring the world that stuck out to Digital Foundry. The article concludes by saying there's "so much left to be desired on the technical front" when it comes to Elden Ring Nightreign, as 60 frames per second performance on consoles is "all too often out of reach."</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Every IGN FromSoftware Game Review</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In other Elden Ring Nightreign news, FromSoftware has confirmed further updates in the pipeline for the co-op exprience, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-duo-expeditions-on-the-way-fromsoftware-confirms-as-sales-jump-to-35-million">including tougher versions of existing Nightlords and a Duos mode somewhere down the line</a>.

Ciri and her horse Kelpie have particularly impressive movement and interactions with each other, NPCs, and the game world as they make their way through the mountains of Kovir to the bustling port town of Valdrest. At one point in the demo, CD Projekt upped the NPC count in the market scene to 300 individually animated characters. The showcase ended with a first look at Lan Exeter, the winter capital and a major port city in Kovir.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The “standalone” tech demo was built to showcase Unreal Engine 5 features, CD Projekt said, and tools it’s using to develop the game’s open world. It is not gameplay footage, the developer stressed.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So, does the tech demo reflect what players can expect from The Witcher 4? CD Projekt said the visuals “reflect the direction we’re taking with The Witcher 4 — but it doesn’t fully represent the final game.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">CD Projekt continued: “Production is still underway, and we have a great deal of work ahead. That said, our goal is ambitious: to create one of the most visually advanced role-playing games to date.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The developer also explained why it chose PS5 over a high-end PC for the tech demo: “Because optimizing for consoles early helps us future-proof performance across all platforms. Consoles come with tighter constraints, and meeting them pushes us to make smarter, more efficient tech choices — the kind that benefit every version of the game.”</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The Witcher 4 Unreal Engine 5 Tech Demo Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">One of the big questions about The Witcher 4 is target launch platforms. With this tech demo on PS5, the suggestion is it will be a cross-gen game that also runs on the next-gen consoles (PS6 and the next-gen Xbox). But if it’s due out on current-gen, does that also mean it will be available on the underpowered Xbox Series S?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s worth remembring that Rockstar’s Grand Theft Auto VI is, as it stands, also due out on current-gen consoles including the Xbox Series S. So if GTA 6 is possible on Microsoft’s cheaper console, perhaps The Witcher 4 is, too.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/could-the-witcher-4-be-targeting-the-ps6-and-next-gen-xbox-given-it-wont-be-out-until-2027-at-the-earliest"><u>CD Projekt has indicated The Witcher 4 won’t be out until 2027 at the earliest</u></a>, so it may be some time before we find out.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.
