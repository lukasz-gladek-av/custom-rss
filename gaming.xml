            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/american-truck-simulator">American Truck Simulator</a> already has in-development DLCs which will see its 18-wheelers head to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/american-truck-simulators-arkansas-dlc-is-under-development">Arkansas</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/american-truck-simulators-next-expansion-takes-the-truck-sim-to-missouri">Missouri</a>, but SCS Software have also commenced building a third: Iowa.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/270880/view/5956653982594462600">announcement on Steam</a> chatters about the sights on offer within the state, from the capital Des Moines to the scenic views of the Mississippi River. It also notes that while "Iowa isn't the biggest State in the USA, it is certainly home to a lot of 'The World's Biggest...' You'll find plenty of interesting landmarks on your journey." 
</p>
<p>Naturally I had to Google this, and I have learned that Iowa is home to the largest: garden gnome, bull statue, starberry statue, and Cheeto (not a statue). I hope every single one of these is present in the game, even if the Cheeto is technically too small to see from your cab window.
</p>
<p>You will, of course, also drive past a lot of corn fields. Those are my abiding memory of riding across Iowa on a train fifteen or so years ago.
</p>
<p>There's no release date for the expansion yet - those tend to come very near to release, and I'd imagine Arkansas and Missouri will see daylight first. You can find <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3025440/American_Truck_Simulator__Iowa/">more screenshots over on Steam, though</a>.</p>

<p id="1wsxC1">On PlayStation and Xbox, <em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em> will go live at <strong>midnight local time on Friday, June 21, in most regions around the world</strong>, according to a graphic posted to social media by developer FromSoftware.</p>
<p id="0nVEZ4"><strong>The exception is the United States</strong> where, once it hits midnight local time on the east coast, the DLC will go live on console for the whole country (meaning those of you on the west coast will be able to play as of 9 p.m. PDT on June 20).</p>
<h3 id="BlNV1X"><strong>Elden Ring DLC PC release time</strong></h3>
<p id="XXzVP7">Meanwhile, on Windows PC, <em>Shadow of the Erdtree </em><strong>launches midnight CEST on Friday, June 21 </strong>at the same time around the world.<strong> </strong>Here’s when that is in your time zone:</p>

<p id="NLAH2v">As described in Polygon’s <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24170532/elden-ring-dlc-shadow-of-the-erdtree-preview-release-date"><em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em> preview</a> and <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/24180518/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-review-dlc-fromsoftware">initial impressions</a>, the DLC is fundamentally “more <em>Elden Ring</em>.” For the most part, that means: sprawling dungeons, relentless enemies, and a vast sense of discovery.</p>
<p id="dTrj1I">For one thing, according to our preview, the expansion is significantly more difficult than the base game. There are new types of collectibles in the mix (including power-ups called Scadutree Fragments). Narratively, <em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em> focuses on Miquella, whom you may know as the brother of <a href="https://www.polygon.com/elden-ring-guide-walkthrough/24176307/malenia-location-weakness-strategy-how-to-beat">Malenia</a>, one of the most notorious boss fights from the base game.</p>
<p id="IXte23">We’re a bit close to the wire, but if you’re still getting ready for the expansion, see our guides on <a href="https://www.polygon.com/elden-ring-shadow-erdtree-guide/24087766/how-to-start-dlc-access-point-location-miquellas-cocoon">how to access <em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em></a> and <a href="https://www.polygon.com/elden-ring-shadow-erdtree-guide/24126482/how-to-prepare-dlc-gear-quests-endgame">how to prepare for the DLC</a>.

Zero, the upcoming installment in the beloved anime arena fighter, is poised to be one of the biggest video game releases for diehard Dragon Ball fans. Just when the game felt like it couldn’t be any more of a love letter to the series, a voice actor from the anime seemingly confirmed that one of the most underappreciated Super Saiyan forms would be making its way to the game as well. </p><p>During a Dragon Ball Z cast panel at Anime Riverside 2024, longtime Goku voice actor Sean Schemmel discussed the challenge of voicing different characters in the series and giving them their own unique voice. In a video <a href="https://youtu.be/pGeH0eFzy6A?t=684" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>uploaded to YouTube by JimmyisaGeek</u></a>, Schemmel seemingly let it slip that Super Saiyan 4 Goku will be playable in Sparking! Zero. </p><p>“I didn’t realize that subtly changing the voice for every single form was gonna bite me in the ass later, and so keeping track of all that for like Super Saiyan 4, Super Saiyan 3, God mode, Red, was all real subtle,” Schemmel said. </p><blockquote data-theme="light">— Dragon Ball Sparking! ZERO News, Posts &amp; Fan Hub (@DBSparkingZER0) <a href="https://twitter.com/DBSparkingZER0/status/1802947580206129383?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">June 18, 2024</a></blockquote> <p>Schemmel credits Damon Mills, the voice actor for Frieza, for helping him keep track of Goku’s Super Saiyan voices on "this last game we’ve been working on.” While Schemmel could be speaking about any Dragon Ball game, there’s a high probability he’s talking about Sparking Zero, seeing as how Mills <a href="https://x.com/DamanMills/status/1733988353119551659" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>serves as the game’s lead voice director</u></a>.</p><p>“Damon has been on top of keeping all my references in line. Going through making sure everything’s right. Really nitpicking it. It’s a very challenging thing to do, but it's really easy so long as you keep vocal references around because the second I can hear it, I can do it,” Schemmel said.  </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/06/18/vs-youtube-dragonballgt-gokussj4hdaiupscale-117-1718740736357.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Super Saiyan 4 Goku in Dragon Ball GT.</figcaption></figure></output><p>Super Saiyan 4, developed by Toei Animation character designer Katsuyoshi Nakatsuru, is one of the most visually unique designs in the Dragon Ball mythos. Contrary to other Super Saiyan forms, which see a color and length change for their Saiyan warriors, Super Saiyan 4 leans in on the Great ape design from OG Dragon Ball by giving its heroes colored fur and a tail. Super Saiyan 4 is also considered the best thing to come out of Dragon Ball’s universally reviled sequel series, Dragon Ball GT, among longtime fans. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div><h3>Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero - June 2024 Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>Prior to Schemmel seemingly spilling the senzu beans about Super Saiyan 4, fans were hard at work <a href="https://x.com/Burcol/status/1802827785679065270?t=nxhZ0x9dD2EI3d8PfAgQ8A&amp;s=19" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">freeze-framing blurry microscopic shots</a> from the latest Sparking! Zero trailer theorizing Super Saiyan 4 Goku being in the game. Those theory crafters are likely breathing a sigh of relief that their speculations weren’t unfounded. </p><p>Schemmel’s apparent Super Saiyan 4 confirmation not only means <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-goes-super-saiyan-heavy-with-reveal-of-first-24-characters">another Goku is being added to Sparking! Zero’s sizeable roster</a>, it could also indicate other super Saiyan 4 characters like Vegeta and Gogeta making their way to the fighter as well. </p><p>In <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-is-like-controlling-a-battle-from-the-anime"><u>our preview</u></a> for Sparking! Zero, we praised the game for feeling like its battles were lifted right out of the anime, saying, “Even after just a dozen or so matches against the CPU, it became clear to me that Dragon Ball superfans who are exceptionally good at fighting games – or those who intend to practice a lot with Sparking Zero – are going to find themselves having a great time crushing their competition.”</p><p>Dragon Ball: Sparking! Zero is slated to launch on October 11 for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X/S.</p><p>Isaiah Colbert is a freelance writer for IGN.

The point-to-point action is a pure first-person shooter. You will be deployed into a few abandoned acres of countryside—similar to the ghost towns of Urzikstan or Erangel—and be asked to shoot your way towards extraction with as much loot as possible in tow. Of course, once you and your friends return to the main menu and have converted all of that booty into cold hard cash, you'll be confronted with Arena Breakout's vast marketplace, gleaming with cosmetics, firearm attachments, or even just a few extra clips of ammunition. It aims to be a game about getting rich and staying rich when one stray headshot might take it all away. </p><p>Arena Breakout aims to be a steely military simulator, with no Call of Duty-style acrobatics or titanic Battlefield set pieces. You craft a grim soldier in the character creator and outfit them with a knapsack of survival gear, which all needs to fit, like Tetris blocks, within your limited inventory. (Generally speaking, you'll be bringing body armor, a backpack, a wealth of food and medical supplies, and yes, lots and lots of ammunition.) Over the course of a match, our hero may grow hungry, or thirsty, or need the bullet in their arm to be removed. With luck, you will have brought the perfect antidote for all of those tasks, avoiding an untimely end to the campaign. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div><h3>Arena Breakout: Infinite Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>In that sense, Arena Breakout might remind you of the venerable survival-sim DayZ, where the player's marching orders are to hunker down and survive for as long as they can until the zombies inevitably come for their brains. But instead of an inevitable dirge towards destruction, Arena Breakout instead partitions its matches into 30 minute chunks, where our job is to gather a whole bunch of loot locked away in safes and coffers around the map before heading towards an extraction point to get out of Dodge. It's a formula that adds a good amount of flexibility for playstyles—both the maniacs and the campers will have plenty to love.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Arena Breakout looked categorically gorgeous on my four-year old PC.</p></div><p>It also certainly helps that Arena Breakout looked categorically gorgeous on my four-year old PC. Infinite is developed by Level Infinite and is a spinoff of a hugely popular mobile shooter with the same name. Going in, I expected a good amount of iPhone jank interfering with the action. But that wasn't the case at all. The maps here are finely detailed and rich with exploitable angles and coverage, and the total draw distance rivals what you might find in more prominent open-world multiplayer shooters. But most impressive of all might be the gun-nut obsessiveness with which you can customize a whole range of firearms to meet your exact build. Shotguns, bolt-action rifles, machine guns, pistols, all completely modular and malleable—and all rendered beautifully when protruding from the bottom of your screen.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Arena Breakout is PvPvE, which is to say that in each match you play, you'll be finding a swathe of easily dispatchable bots bumbling around the outskirts of certain important chokepoints. (You'll take them down with ease, but don't expect them to be carrying much loot.) I like that Infinite always provides us with something to shoot at, considering this sort of shooter formula can get bogged down in the doldrums pretty quickly. Furthermore, the marketplace, where you offload your riches, is a game unto itself. Every item in the Arena Breakout inventory seems to hinge on a sliding scale of supply and demand. Did you spend most of your time in World of Warcraft being a shark at the Orgrimmar auction house? Well, we certainly have a shooter for you.</p><p>But this also gets to my only real anxiety about Infinite as it stands. Arena Breakout is about scoring loot, and ratcheting up thresholds of lethal material, turning your character into a progressively more effective killing machine. But some of those gearing thresholds are punitive. Superior ammunition tiers are necessary for penetrating stronger armor, so to stay ahead of the curve, players are incentivized to dump a lot of time and effort into their extraction runs. Will that grind grow punitive over time? Especially when all it takes is one unlucky ambush for you to lose everything you're carrying? So far, I've enjoyed walking the tightrope that Arena Breakout is stringing out for us. Let's just hope we don't fall off.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

In a quote, Wester said the game would not meet expectations: “A version that we’d be satisfied with is too far away, and therefore we are taking the difficult decision to cancel the release<em>.</em>” The decision resulted in an estimated $19.8 million write-down for the company, which has seen other trouble as of late. Last year, the company announced it would write down <em>The Lamplighters League</em> <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/paradox-is-taking-a-write-down-on-the-lamplighters-league/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">for approximately $23 million</a> a week after the game launched. </p>
 <p data-characters="598" data-current-count="598" data-injectable="false">It has been troubling all around. Paradox Tectonic’s shuttering feels like another stone in the road for <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/deus-exs-adam-jensen-gives-heartfelt-thanks-to-fans-amidst-eidos-layoffs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">an industry</a> that <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/outriders-developer-people-can-fly-confirms-layoffs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">has already</a> experienced <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/ea-executives-earned-60m-last-fiscal-year-despite-layoffs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a lot of job loss</a> in 2024 — and we’re only halfway through the year. Just yesterday, before the news of the <em>Life by You </em>cancellation, Embracer Group announced the closure of <em>Alone in the Dark</em> (2024) <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/embracer-group-kills-yet-another-studio-after-its-alone-in-the-dark-remake-underperformed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">developer Pieces Interactive</a>. Microsoft closed down the <em>Hi-Fi Rush</em> developer Tango Gameworks and Arkane Austin (along with Alpha Dog Games) ahead of its big June showcase. Needless to say, the move <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/microsofts-recent-layoffs-cast-a-heavy-shadow-over-this-years-xbox-showcase/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">dampened the excitement</a> before the show. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/nintendo-direct-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-metroid-prime-4<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The Nintendo Switch is on its last legs, with a successor lurking in its shadow to such a degree that Nintendo has felt the need to repeatedly inform people that it won’t be present at events like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kX3BkD5PVUM" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">today’s Nintendo Direct</a>. But you wouldn’t have known it from watching, well, today’s Nintendo Direct: If the original Switch is going down, it’s going down swinging. A new <em>Zelda </em>where you (finally) play as Zelda and the long-awaited re-reveal of <em>Metroid Prime 4</em> grabbed headlines, but the Switch’s dying gasp has breadth. In this regard, Nintendo continues to buck industry trends and go its own way. Good!&nbsp;</p><p>Last week I wrote about my <a href="https://aftermath.site/microsoft-xbox-showcase-summer-game-fest" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">lack of enthusiasm</a> toward Microsoft’s bench of tired franchises, and there’s no denying that Nintendo <em>loves</em> a time-honored franchise. Zelda and Samus predate Marcus Fenix and Fable He/She/They by multiple decades. But Nintendo’s great strength is that it maintains a keen sense of when to Get (Economically) Weird With It. While <em>The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</em> is long overdue, it’s otherwise a great example of this: The game is built from the same foundation as the <em>Link’s Awakening</em> remake, but it’s got a new main character and central mechanic to match. I, for one, cannot wait to <a href="https://x.com/HarrisFoster/status/1803074649325973714" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">table</a> Ganon to death.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Mario &amp; Luigi: Brothership</em> is similar. It’s not a mainline series entry – I’m sure Nintendo is saving that for the Switch 2 – but it continues a role-playing side saga that other companies would do well to learn from if they insist on going back to the same franchise wells time and time again. Let characters explore additional genres and worlds. Make games both large and small. Vary players’ diets. Man cannot live on triple-A tentpoles alone.&nbsp;</p><p>Then, of course, there’s <em>Metroid Prime 4</em>, which was honestly the least exciting part of the showcase to me. It looked fine! I guess I just expected more after years of waiting and a slightly worrisome <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/01/25/metroid-prime-4-development-restarting-from-the-beginning" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">development reboot in 2019</a>. But it exists. And rather than saving it for the Switch 2, Nintendo is letting it serve as the original Switch’s swan song in 2025, with an impressively stacked 2024 lineup getting the crowd warmed up for it. I’ve yet to even mention <em>Super Mario Party Jamboree</em>, <em>Donkey Kong Country Returns HD</em>, <em>Pokemon Legends Z-A</em>, and a whole host of third-party gems like<em> Fantasian: Neo Dimension</em>, <em>The Hundred Line: Last Defense Academy, Romancing Saga 2</em>, and the <em>Dragon Quest III</em> remake, most of which are coming out this year or early next.&nbsp;</p><p>I will readily admit my biases here: I’m grading on a curve since one would typically expect far less than this from a console near the end of its life, and I also like RPGs. Even so, this is a strong procession of games that are all coming soon. I’m not always certain if I was correct to buy a PlayStation 5, and I doubt I’ll ever pick up an Xbox Series X, but I know exactly what I’m going to be playing on my Nintendo Switch in the near future. That kind of consistency is an underrated quality, one that’s easy to take for granted. Not only that, but Nintendo has maintained it over the course of the Switch’s entire life cycle. Despite being seven years old, my Switch has never collected dust.&nbsp;</p><p>Nintendo knows what works for it, and over the years it has stayed that course, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wii_U" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">at times to its own detriment</a>. But when it works, it really works. The Switch has been a smash success, which has allowed Nintendo to stick to its guns even as it navigates an industry that’s <a href="https://aftermath.site/microsoft-layoffs-franchises-ip-sony-ea" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">doubling down on fewer, bigger games</a>. It is notable that Nintendo hasn’t laid off hundreds or thousands of workers in the past couple years, nor has it jumped aboard the forever game bandwagon (unless<em> Mario Kart 8</em> counts). I’d be remiss if I didn’t mention that the former is <a href="https://x.com/haleyfax/status/1803052670611038472" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a result of labor law</a> as much as it is anything else, but there’s also a hopeful truth at the core of Nintendo’s approach: If you create something good and dependable, people will appreciate it. You don’t have to trick or trap them to build a successful business.&nbsp;</p><p>More importantly, they’ll keep coming back. Nintendo doesn’t need to sink a frankly horrifying amount of time and manpower into a microtransaction-powered live service game because it has continually reached beyond the audience that would even play such a thing and given kids, adults, and just about every other imaginable demographic a bunch of friendly, imaginative experiences. Could another company pull this off without literally owning Mario, the Mickey Mouse of video games? I don’t know. But I’m glad Nintendo’s doing it.&nbsp;</p><p>Now please stop <a href="https://aftermath.site/nintendo-yuzu-emulator-citra" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sicking your lawyers on emulators and fan projects</a>.

This all takes place in a persistent open world called Solisium, where dynamic, interactive environments affect the gameplay in meaningful ways. Unpredictable weather cycles impact how your weapons perform, alter the terrain around you, and reveal new access points. While exploring the world, players will be able to transform into creatures that fly through the air or take to the sea for rapid travel, or even morph into defeated bosses to turn the tide in battle.</p></blockquote><p>Watch a new trailer below.</p><!-- AD: content -->

The most recent iteration, Galactic Sports, was a Vita exclusive that never made it out of PAL regions, so it's nice to see a new family-friendly arcade sports game in the pipeline.</p><p dir="ltr">Looney Tunes: Wacky World of Sports will feature a collection of mini-games based on basketball, soccer, golf, and tennis, but with unique gameplay twists like powerups and special moves. The game includes solo and multiplayer modes, and each player will be able to control iconic Looney Tunes characters like Bugs Bunny, Daffy Duck, Porky Pig, and more. Unsurprisingly, Wacky World of Sports is reminiscent of Mario sports games, such as the Wii's Mario Sports Mix and 3DS' Mario Sports Superstars as well the entries on Switch: <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fgoto.walmart.com%2Fc%2F1804712%2F565706%2F9383%3Fveh%3Daff%26sourceid%3Dimp_000011112222333344%26u%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FNintendo-Mario-Golf-Super-Rush-Nintendo-Switch-Games%2F432567681%26subId1%3Dsubid_value&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Flooney-tunes-wacky-world-of-sports-preorder-guide%2F1100-6524382%2F%3Fftag%3DCAD-01-10abi2f&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Mario Golf: Super Rush</a>, <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fshop-links.co%2F1806410424423360561%3Fu1%3Dsubid_value&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Flooney-tunes-wacky-world-of-sports-preorder-guide%2F1100-6524382%2F%3Fftag%3DCAD-01-10abi2f&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Mario Tennis Aces</a>, and <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fgoto.walmart.com%2Fc%2F1804712%2F565706%2F9383%3Fveh%3Daff%26sourceid%3Dimp_000011112222333344%26u%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FMario-Strikers-Battle-League-Nintendo-Switch%2F725662018%26subId1%3Dsubid_value&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Flooney-tunes-wacky-world-of-sports-preorder-guide%2F1100-6524382%2F%3Fftag%3DCAD-01-10abi2f&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Mario Strikers: Battle League</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">If you enjoy Mario sports games and like Looney Tunes--or are simply sad Mario Hoops 3-on-3 never received a sequel--you can <strong><a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fshop-links.co%2F1845486187299003978%3Fu1%3Dsubid_value&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Flooney-tunes-wacky-world-of-sports-preorder-guide%2F1100-6524382%2F%3Fftag%3DCAD-01-10abi2f&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">preorder Looney Tunes: Wacky World of Sports</a></strong> now on consoles.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Looney Tunes: Wacky World of Sports Preorder Bonus</h2><p dir="ltr">No Looney Tunes: Wacky World of Sports preorder bonuses have been announced yet.</p><div title="6524382 -

            <p>Classic RPG Dragon Quest 3 is getting a remake in Square Enix's now familiar HD-2D style, which blends high-resolution 2D sprites together with 3D worlds. It'll land on November 14th. "<em>Waitaminute</em>," you might be saying, "Shouldn't they remake the first two games beforehand?" No, you numpty, you nyaff, you roaster; within the internal chronology of Dragon Quest, 3 comes first.
</p>
<p>Plus, they are remaking 1 and 2 as well, for release sometime in 2025.

<p>The tease for DQI and DQII comes right at the very end of the above trailer, and the three games together form what Square Enix are calling the Erdrick trilogy. 
</p>
<p>The remake was announced all the way back in 2021 for the series' 35th anniversary, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/square-enix-announces-dragon-quest-12">alongside the announcement of Dragon Quest 12</a>, the next mainline game in the series. 
</p>
<p>I'm not sure it's been seen since, although its re-appearance today isn't entirely a surprise, either. Square Enix teased its appearance in a tweet on 'Dragon Quest day' - May 27th, the release date of the original game in Japan in 1986. "The legend of Erdrick draws near," read <a href="https://x.com/DragonQuest/status/1794987069531476347">the post</a>.
</p>
<p>I have not played any Dragon Quest game other than a tiny bit of DQ11, but that makes me more interested in the remakes, not less, because it feels like an opportunity to rectify my ignorance of the series. Aside from the updated graphics, Square Enix are promising that the HD-2D release will have "an improved and modernized UI, and other quality of life improvements," when it arrives later this year <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2701660/DRAGON_QUEST_III_HD2D_Remake/">on Steam</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24181059/legend-of-zelda-echoes-wisdom-why-no-sword-gameplay-nintendo-link<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="3awZkz">It’s big, big news that in the Zelda game announced during <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24180900/nintendo-direct-june-2024-everything-announced-games">Tuesday’s Nintendo Direct</a><em> — </em><a href="https://www.polygon.com/24180883/legend-of-zelda-echoes-wisdom-nintendo-switch-release-date"><em>The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</em></a> — players will assume control of Princess Zelda rather than Link. It’s the first time in history you’ll be able to play a full game as the title character (unless you count the notably terrible CD-i games, which director Eiji Aonuma <a href="https://www.mtv.com/news/ptkydm/eiji-aonuma-addresses-those-horrible-zelda-cd-i-games">doesn’t consider canon</a>). But there’s one key point of intrigue: In <em>Echoes</em>, Aonuma said Zelda doesn’t fight with a sword — ever.</p>
<p id="YHSBwc">Some longtime players, like myself, might find Zelda’s lack of a sword a bit disappointing initially. After all, she does have several swords in her possession at various points in the series: Zelda’s sword from <em>Twilight Princess </em>is definitively hers; she wields rapiers in the Hyrule Warriors games; and in <em>Breath of the Wild</em>, she hangs on to the Master Sword to protect it while Link takes a 100-year nap. Usually, like Zelda herself, these weapons only appear in cutscenes and other cinematics, and it’s only in a few moments that we see her defend herself using a sword.</p>

<p id="zUHSOj">But I have a hunch that it isn’t just her character’s canon that kept Aonuma from giving her a sword in <em>Echoes</em>. Sure, it’s true that some aspects of other Zelda tales would fall apart if suddenly Zelda were a master of swordplay. In <em>Ocarina of Time</em>, for instance, she uses the harp rather than a more traditional weapon when she’s disguised as Sheik. And she certainly can’t use the Master Sword, which famously only works if Link wields it.</p>
<p id="PzBMlo">That said, it also serves <em>Echoes</em>’ gameplay — and the potential for future games that include both Link and Zelda as playable characters — for the heroine to ditch swordsmanship for this game. The decision puts a clear distinction between Zelda’s mission to harness the “power of her wisdom” and Link’s frequent quest to find varied weapons and, eventually, the Master Sword. </p>
<p id="q7HNdV">According to the Nintendo Direct, Zelda’s character will use a wand to wield the Echo power, which she can use to duplicate items in the game environment to solve puzzles and battle enemies. (Polygon senior editor Oli Welsh pointed out in our internal Slack that this mechanic is essentially Ultrahand from <em>Tears of the Kingdom.</em>) Players can use Echo to copy a table or a trampoline, for instance, and paste those items in the world when they need them to hop over walls or climb a tower.</p>
<p id="F88I5I">Zelda’s Echo reminds me of the masks in <em>Majora’s Mask</em>, or even the Fuse power in <em>Tears of the Kingdom</em> — mechanics that allow the player to solve a given puzzle in several ways, even if those methods aren’t necessarily predetermined by the developer (i.e., fusing a bunch of wooden slats together to <a href="https://www.polygon.com/legend-zelda-tears-kingdom/23723279/totk-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-bridge-totk">make a bridge</a> to get across a chasm). Particularly during the months following the release of <em>Tears of the Kingdom</em>, tons of players considered their solutions to be outside of what the developers intended — and indeed, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/legend-zelda-tears-kingdom/24001489/zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-totk-developer-interview">Aonuma told Polygon</a>, “I was surprised to see what people have gotten up to in the game. [...] It’s something that kind of blew my mind. I mean, there are limits to how many objects you can put together. But people really rushed to find out what those limits were, and that was surprising to me.”</p>

<p id="bcLoSK">The trailer for <em>Echoes</em> included a clip of Zelda stacking several water cubes, then stepping into them to float to the top, where she steps out onto a previously inaccessible area. It’s gameplay like that that makes me fully trust Nintendo’s decision to keep Zelda swordless. In <em>Echoes</em>, she has the power to replicate items she can use to defend herself, not to mention that she can duplicate enemies and use them to fight on her behalf (like any good princess should).</p>
<p id="uQRL6C">In all, Zelda’s swordless-ness does not seem to be a ploy to keep her less powerful or more dainty than Link — instead, it’s a reminder that the franchise isn’t only about the Master Sword. Moreover, it’s a reminder that Zelda’s greatest power is her intellect, which she uses time and again throughout the franchise to trick enemies, empower her friends, and lead with compassion. </p>

You see, despite Zelda being the namesake of the series, Link has been the protagonist of most of the franchise. For a long time, fans have hoped for a Zelda-led title that would reverse their roles, making it so that <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/legend-zelda-echoes-wisdom-trailer-release-date-link-1851546323&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/legend-zelda-echoes-wisdom-trailer-release-date-link-1851546323">Link is the one being saved by Zelda</a></span>. This hypothetical game’s name: why, <em>The Legend of Link</em>, of course.</p><p>In their excitement, many took to Twitter to jokingly declare that Nintendo <em>obviously </em>got the name of the game wrong. Others have taken the opportunity to show off their own fan art of the concept of a Zelda-led game.</p><p>And then there’s this big brain play.<br></p><p>As fun as it is to ponder why Nintendo didn’t actually go forward with the joke, there are two very likely reasons. The first is that Nintendo’s developers may be so detached from the internet and all the jokes we make on there that it never seriously crossed anyone’s mind. Nintendo is known for actually retaining its staff, which is why there are so many senior folks there that have worked on some of these franchises for literal decades, like Aonuma. They probably don’t pay all the chatter online any mind, and hey, good for them.<br></p><p>The more likely case is that it absolutely did come up at some point, but in order to keep the brand intact, they went forward with the <em>Legend of Zelda </em>moniker. Also, the last time there was a Zelda-led game that changed up the naming scheme…it kind of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zelda%27s_Adventure&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zelda%27s_Adventure" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">sucked</a></span>.<br></p><p>As funny as <em>The Legend of Link</em> is, it doesn’t quite roll off the tongue in the same way. Though you and I may be certain it isn’t confusing, there are other more casual gamers and purchasers who might be thrown for a loop by the sudden name change. There are already people who think Link is named Zelda because he’s the hero of the games, so naming the Zelda-led game after Link might give someone an aneurysm. Much as I hate it, it’s just simpler this way, but <em>The Legend of Link</em> shall live on in all our hearts and minds. And Twitter now, I guess.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p data-characters="276" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">If you’re considering delving into the Iain M. Banks’ Culture series, you would be forgiven for feeling a little overwhelmed by the sheer volume of work and deciding what order to read them in. Thankfully, it is mostly down to personal preference, so here is mine.</p> <h2 id="h-what-order-to-read-the-culture-series" data-injectable="false">What order to read the Culture series</h2> <p data-characters="454" data-current-count="454" data-injectable="true">When I read these books the first time, I picked them up more or less in order of publication and read them this way. Now, I would like to prelude this piece by saying that it is perfectly fine. But, looking back, I may have done it a little differently. There are good works and great works, and some curious ones, too. This means that it is possible to gain a little more from your first time <a href="https://geni.us/uAaZt" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">reading the <em>Culture</em> series</a> if you choose a different order.</p>
 <h3 id="h-1-player-of-games" data-injectable="false"><a href="https://geni.us/9d5Uy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">#1 Player of Games</a></h3> <p data-characters="334" data-current-count="334" data-injectable="false">Although this is the second of Iain M. Banks’s published works in the <em>Culture</em> series, I would put it first in the reading order. The world of <a href="https://geni.us/9d5Uy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow"><em>Player of Games</em></a> perfectly introduces the reader to the <em>Culture</em> series without boring them. It also really shows off the scale and brilliance of what is to come in the rest of the books. </p> <p data-characters="288" data-current-count="622" data-injectable="true"><em>Player of Games</em> shows off Banks’ wonderful imagination for adventure and inventiveness. Humans’ minds are tested to the limits under insane and wonderful situations, while sentient AIs look on in benevolent glory. <em>Player of Games</em> is <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/10-best-sci-fi-books-of-all-time/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a rollercoaster ride</a> from beginning to end.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image: Reddit </figcaption></figure> <h3 id="h-2-use-of-weapons" data-injectable="false"><a href="https://geni.us/tw4rtu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">#2 Use of Weapons</a></h3> <p data-characters="293" data-current-count="593" data-injectable="true">This is a great second book in the order of the <em>Culture</em> series due to its display of the creativity Iain M. Banks is capable of. The book is set into two opposing narratives, with each chapter focusing on an alternative timeline. One is moving backward chronologically, and the other forwards.</p>
 <p data-characters="373" data-current-count="373" data-injectable="false">Aside from the wonderful storytelling and Banks’ ability to write war of such galactic magnitude, this is just a taste of things to come. The <em>Culture</em> series has a number of books in the collection that are a little out there in their narrative. This is what makes the series one of the all-time greats. <a href="https://geni.us/tw4rtu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow"><em>Use of Weapons</em></a> is an exciting and accessible introduction to it.</p> <h3 id="h-3-consider-phlebas" data-injectable="false"><a href="https://geni.us/Q9yI" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">#3 Consider Phlebas</a></h3> <p data-characters="284" data-current-count="657" data-injectable="true">This book gets a bad rap, but it is where I started because it was first published. It has often been blamed for the reason people won’t pick up a second <em>Culture</em> novel after the first: some find it dull. It focuses on one episode of a galactic war told from many points of view.</p>
 <p data-characters="442" data-current-count="442" data-injectable="true">While creative and, I think, wonderful to read, it doesn’t really show off just what the <em>Culture</em> series is all about. Taking this book as the third will still make the references to the Idiran War in the later books relevant. However, by this point, you’ll be more willing to give Banks at least one slow book. Canonically it is important to understand the goings on in <a href="https://geni.us/Q9yI" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow"><em>Consider Phlebas</em></a>, but it <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/the-5-best-fantasy-sci-fi-novellas-from-the-past-5-years/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">isn’t his most</a> gripping work.</p>
 <h3 id="h-4-excession" data-injectable="false"><a href="https://geni.us/KKG7p" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">#4 Excession</a></h3> <p data-characters="334" data-current-count="334" data-injectable="false">To pick things back up after the slow but still wonderful <em>Consider Phelbes</em>, you should consider <a href="https://geni.us/KKG7p" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow"><em>Excession</em></a>. This book is a wonderful example of how Iain M. Banks can broach subjects as large and complex as interdimensional superstructures while still maintaining a truly engaging romance story involving gender fluidity and childbirth.</p> <p data-characters="130" data-current-count="464" data-injectable="true">This book is a real delve into the weird and wonderful mind of Iain M. Banks when he is given the freedom of true science fiction.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image: Reddit</figcaption></figure> <h3 id="h-5-look-to-windward" data-injectable="false"><a href="https://geni.us/tNb8p2S" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">#5 Look to Windward</a></h3> <p data-characters="457" data-current-count="757" data-injectable="true"><a href="https://geni.us/tNb8p2S" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow"><em>Look to Windward</em></a> is a fantastic delve into some of the many varied and inventive races that exist within the Culture. Look to Windward is a perfect midpoint novel to read in the order of the <em>Culture </em>series for a few reasons. By this point, as readers, we are familiar with the AI and their varied, eccentric personalities. This is played upon heavily in <em>Look to Windward</em>, with the true humanity and relationship with physical beings being properly explored.</p>
 <h3 id="h-6-matter" data-injectable="false"><a href="https://geni.us/6Bm8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">#6 Matter</a></h3> <p data-characters="388" data-current-count="388" data-injectable="false"><a href="https://geni.us/6Bm8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow"><em>Matter</em></a> is no laughing matter and it could threaten the structural integrity of any shelf it sits upon. The book itself is a monster and shouldn’t be attempted by anyone not already invested in the <em>Culture</em> series. I personally consider it one of my favorites due to its complexity, vast scope, and thrilling narrative, but I was already deeply invested in the Banks’ universe. </p> <p data-characters="228" data-current-count="616" data-injectable="true"><em>Matter</em> is a monster, but it rarely feels like a chore. If you have already become familiar with the world of <em>Culture</em>, then this book is just what the doctor ordered. It is <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/10-best-sci-fi-books-of-all-time/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a true epic</a> in the series and a pleasure on every page. </p>
 <h3 id="h-7-surface-detail" data-injectable="false"><a href="https://geni.us/W2wEW9B" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">#7 Surface Detail</a></h3> <p data-characters="332" data-current-count="332" data-injectable="false">Iain M. Banks plays with many interesting concepts in <a href="https://geni.us/W2wEW9B" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow"><em>Surface Detail</em></a>. The idea of human-created hells, capitalism, humans being in control of their own afterlives, and the threat of binding contracts are all wrapped up in this book. It is wild, scary, often horrific, and complex in its various branches and is a real moral workout.</p> <p data-characters="233" data-current-count="565" data-injectable="true">As a standalone book, this is a wonderful choice. It clearly demonstrates Iain M. Banks’ ability to make the most of the science fiction genre. It can be picked up in any order of the <em>Culture</em> series or outside of it completely.</p>
 <h3 id="h-8-the-hydrogen-sonata" data-injectable="false"><a href="https://geni.us/tlGL" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">#8 The Hydrogen Sonata</a></h3> <p data-characters="300" data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false">I remember finishing this book and doing what I always did by immediately popping to my local bookshop for the next in the series. Finding out this was the final one left a gaping hole in my literary heart. It was like saying goodbye to a friend, not knowing it would be the last time we ever spoke. </p> <p data-characters="334" data-current-count="634" data-injectable="true"><a href="https://geni.us/tlGL" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow"><em>The Hydrogen Sonata</em></a> is a fitting end to what I consider to be the core <em>Culture</em> novels in the order you can read them. It deals with the idea of death and the end, using a race of beings as the final goodbye Banks gives to his readers. It is deep and complex and addresses the complexity of ‘The End’ and what it all means.</p>
 <h3 id="h-9-inversions" data-injectable="false"><a href="https://geni.us/oKsh" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">#9 Inversions</a></h3> <p data-characters="503" data-current-count="503" data-injectable="true">Banks has described this as an “attempt to write a culture novel that wasn’t,” and that pretty much sums it up. In this entry to the <em>Culture</em> series, we say goodbye to the mega ships controlled by AI and the comfort of a world of excess and plenty and instead are brought down to a planet representing Medieval Europe. <a href="https://geni.us/oKsh" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow"><em>Inversions</em></a>, despite being a <em>Culture</em> novel, is an unusual one in the lineup, but one I love none the less. A good book for after the madness of intergalactic adventure.</p>
 <h3 id="h-10-the-state-of-the-art" data-injectable="false"><a href="https://geni.us/EUYM" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">#10 The State of The Art</a></h3> <p data-characters="514" data-current-count="514" data-injectable="false">This <a href="https://geni.us/EUYM" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">collection of short stories</a> is a wonderful way to flesh out the <em>Culture</em> series at the end of the reading list order. These short stories expand on the Culture’s relationship to Earth and introduce some interesting characters and concepts. This collection of stories is Banks typically flexing his creative muscle. As a book, it can easily be picked up and put down throughout the list of <em>Culture</em> books as you read them. They are a lovely way to pepper one of the <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/best-science-fiction-book-series" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">best science fiction series of all time</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/unstoppable-board-game-roguelike-deck-builder-is-fully-funded-on-kickstarter<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Renegade Game Studios has launched a new board game Kickstarter. The campaign is for the <em>Unstoppable</em> board game, a co-op roguelike momentum deck-builder by the creator of <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/mystic-vale-digital-edition-review-fantasy-gardener" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Mystic Vale</em></a>. Within the first day, the campaign was fully funded.</p>

<p>According to the campaign page, the <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/renegadegamestudios/unstoppable-a-card-crafting-game-by-john-d-clair/description"><em>Unstoppable</em> board game</a> is the latest in Renegade's Solo Game series. The game is set in a sci-fi world and revolves around three planets. The cutthroat city-world of Ceres II, Virenos' deadly forests, and trash-riddled wasteland that is Mithras.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/unstoppable-board-game-set-up.jpg?itok=xi-goE2i 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/unstoppable-board-game-set-up.jpg?itok=omdsffLy 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Build your cards, build your deck. Good luck.</figcaption></figure><p>The game can be played either solo or co-op with another player. You play as someone touched by fate. tasked with stopping something that threatens all three worlds. To pull that off, you will need to gather allies, train, upgrade your tools, and become unstoppable.</p>
<p>A game of <em>Unstoppable</em> is simple. You pick one of four heroes and a boss to fight. You take turns drafting and upgrading cards. You'll use these cards to face threats, level up, and gain momentum. But the longer you take, the more dangerous the boss becomes. The game ends when you win or fail.</p>
<p>Upgrading cards in the <em>Unstoppable</em> board game is thanks to the game's card-crafting system. Like <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/solforge-fusion-starter-kit-review" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Solforge Fusion</em></a>, you can stack different upgrade cards on different core cards, effectively making a unique kind of card as you play. There are 100 core cards and 36 upgrade cards in the base game, that is 3,600 possible combinations.</p>
<p>The game was designed by John D. Clair. Clair's tabletop design credits include <em>Mystic Vale</em>, the award-winning 4X card-crafting pirate game <em>Dead Reckoning </em>and the collaborative flora and fauna board game <em>Ecos: First Continen</em>t.</p>
<p>In addition, it continues Renegade Game Studio's reputation of producing experimental and ambitious board games. Their catalog include <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/search-for-lost-species-funded-in-15-minutes" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>The Search For Lost Species</em></a>, <em>The Vale of Eternity</em>, and the silent role-playing game <em>Alice Is Missing</em>.</p>
<p>The different pledge tiers for the <em>Unstoppable</em> board game are as follows:</p>
<ul><li><strong>Can't Stop for $60:</strong> A physical copy of the game and any unlocked stretch goals.</li>
<li><strong>Won't Stop for $75:</strong> A physical copy, any unlocked stretch goals, and an official game mat.</li>
<li><strong>Never Gonna Stop for $90</strong>: A physical copy, any unlocked stretch goals, and two official game mats.</li>
<li><strong>Unstoppable All In for $100:</strong> A physical copy, any unlocked stretch goals, and three official game mats.</li>
</ul><p>The campaign's stretch goals mostly add extra cards to the base game.Up to 12 additional Ally Cards, 6 Tactics Cards, and 5 Upgrade Cards.</p>
<p>At time of writing, the <em>Unstoppable</em> board game campaign has raised $62,762, more than six times its initial funding goal of $10,000. The campaign concludes July 3</p>

            <p>The Ace Attorney Investigations Collection is heading to PC later this year on September 6th. <em>"Waitaminute,"</em> you might be saying, "Didn't this already come out?" No, you choob, you eejit, you dafty, you're thinking of one of several other collections of Ace Attorney games.
</p>
<p>Ace Attorney Investigations Collection comprises two games: Ace Attorney Investigations: Miles Edgeworth and its sequel, Ace Attorney Investigations 2: Prosecutor’s Gambit. Neither game has been on PC before, and the latter has never been released outside of Japan.

<p>Both games star Miles Edgeworth, Phoenix Wright's jaboted prosecutorial rival. Where it differs most from the better known games is that it takes place beyond the confines of the courtroom, with Edgeworth walking about crime scenes, finding evidence, and interrogating suspects. It was also created without series creator Shu Takumi, which might account for why it's generally less loved than the Wright games.
</p>
<p>If you're a completionist, or so in love with these characters you'll follow them anywhere, then it's only a good thing that you'll soon be able to play them in English on PC. I think this means every (non-crossover) Ace Attorney game will now be on PC, between this, the Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney Trilogy, the Apollo Justice: Ace Attorney Trilogy, and The Great Ace Attorney Chronicles (a duology). The only remaining outlier is Professor Layton vs. Phoenix Wright: Ace Attorney, a mashup I imagine Nintendo would not allow to leave one of their platforms.
</p>
<p>Of course, this means that all that's left to do is to give Shu Takumi a giant budget to make new Ace Attorney games. In the meantime, you'll find <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2401970/Ace_Attorney_Investigations_Collection/">the Ace Attorney Investigations Collection on Steam</a>.</p>

			<p>Today, Amazon Games revealed that NCSoft's fantasy MMORPG Throne and Liberty will arrive in North and South America, Europe, Australia, New Zealand, and Japan in less than three months. To be exact, the game will be released on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X (with cross-play, as previously <a href="https://wccftech.com/throne-and-liberty-will-be-published-by-amazon-games-mmorpg-to-feature-crossplay-between-pc-and-consoles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a>) on September 17. Amazon Games also confirmed that the business model will be free-to-play, just like in the original Korean release. An Open Beta test will take place on all platforms between July 18 and 23, allowing players to check out the game before the launch.</p>
<p>Amazon worked closely with NCSoft on the localization of Throne and Liberty over the last year. Moonyoung Choi, Camp Captain at NCSoft, said:</p>
<p><em>Although there are international players who enjoy the game on Korean servers, we don’t often have the opportunity to collect and analyze their feedback comprehensively. Collaborating with Amazon Games has allowed us to receive feedback from a wide range of global users, which was extremely valuable to us. Amazon Games didn’t simply present user needs as demands: they used various reports and data to convincingly explain to our team why certain changes were necessary and how many users wanted them.</em></p>
<p>Daniel Lafuente, Globalization Design Manager at Amazon Games, added:</p>
<p><em>From day one, we’ve been working tightly with NCSoft to make sure Throne and Liberty hits the mark for a global audience. We’ve been in the trenches together, running multiple public test phases to get direct feedback from players worldwide. That input has allowed us to really shape the game’s direction in unison with NCSoft over the last year-plus. At the end of the day, it’s been a truly collaborative effort adapting the core experience while still keeping the soul of what makes Throne and Liberty awesome.</em></p>

<p>Moonseop Lee, Game Design Director, <a href="https://www.amazongames.com/en-us/news/articles/throne-and-liberty-brings-online-rpgs-into-new-era" target="_blank" rel="noopener">provided</a> an overview of what kind of activities MMORPG fans can expect in the game:</p>
<p><em>In Throne and Liberty, there are numerous goals that can be achieved through guilds, including guild rankings, Conquest Battles, and Castle Sieges. Guilds are at the core of strategic competitive battles. Guild members not only work together to achieve common goals, but also benefit from a guild reward system that includes distributing raid items and sharing rewards from events among members. However, the greatest appeal of a guild is the sense of belonging it provides, ensuring that you always have companions by your side.</em></p>

You know, one of those <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/boomer-shooter-retro-fps-dusk-ion-fury-prodeus-1851144571/slides/5&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/boomer-shooter-retro-fps-dusk-ion-fury-prodeus-1851144571/slides/5">old-school FPS throwbacks like <em>Dusk </em>or <em>Cultic</em>.</a></span> But that’s not the case at all! <em>Fallen Aces</em> instead plays more like <em>Thief </em>or <em>Deus Ex</em>, but styled like a 1940s comic book about mafia goons, private detectives, and masked vigilantes. Instead of running around with a shotgun and rocket launcher killing everything that moves, <em>Fallen Aces</em> is focused primarily on melee combat, stealth, and exploration. And it nails this mixture perfectly, letting you play each of the first episode’s levels in a variety of ways, all of which are viable and fun.<br></p><p>Do you want to go in with a careful plan, quietly moving from shadow to shadow using judo strikes to knock gangsters out cold and then leave before anyone knows you were there? You can do that. But you can also run in with a baseball bat and a wrench and just beat the shit out of everyone in your way, which is how I played most of <em>Fallen Aces</em>. And I had just as much fun fighting dudes as I did sneaking around baddies while exploring the game’s large and intricate levels.</p><h2 id="h10221"><a id=""></a><strong>Mighty mighty man</strong></h2><p>Something I really appreciate about<em> Fallen Aces</em> is how exciting and wild combat can be. At one point I found myself in a room with five gangsters who all wanted me dead. I had a broken baseball bat and…nothing else. In a lot of stealth-heavy games, this is the point where I might reload a save. And you can do that. But what I love about<em> Fallen Aces</em> is that fighting your way out of a rumble is just as fun as pulling off a perfect plan.<br></p><p>So when I found myself cornered by those gangsters, I looked around and found a fire extinguisher. I tossed the broken bat at one of the closer goons, grabbed the extinguisher from the wall, and sprayed the guys down with the chemical powder inside. When I saw one get stunned I ran up and kicked him into his pals. Then I turned the extinguisher around with a button press and began walloping the crew with it, breaking up my attacks with swift kicks. The last guy standing was stunned, dizzy, and set up perfectly for a finisher. I grabbed him and punched him through a window and out to the street below. Then I saved my game. Who needs stealth when you have a big metal extinguisher and a strong kick?<br></p><p>For those who prefer guns over fists and bats, <em>Fallen Aces</em> does feature firearms, too. Ammo for these weapons is hard to find and they are loud, so be prepared for all the enemies in the area to swarm you if you start shooting. But guns are also mighty powerful and helped save me during a few intense moments. And like everything else in the game, you can toss guns at enemies once you run out of ammo.<br></p><h2 id="h10222"><a id=""></a><strong>It’s all over but the crying</strong></h2><p>I’ve avoided talking about <em>Fallen Aces</em>’ story and characters not because I don’t like them or because I think the writing is bad. The narrative about a PI getting wrapped up in a wild conspiracy involving murder, crooked heroes, and fallen comrades is good stuff. And the comic book cutscenes between each episode are top-notch, too.<br></p><figure id="" data-id="1082ac34d29919c63c0d9ef9377f2d0c" data-recommend-id="image://1082ac34d29919c63c0d9ef9377f2d0c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot shows mafia goons taking on a player with a shotgun.

" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The problem is that you can burn through <em>Fallen Aces’ </em>first episode in about three to four hours. So while the story is great, there’s so little here that I don’t want to spoil anything. That said, by the end of the final (currently available) mission, I was excited to play more, not just because I want to bash more skulls, but because I want to see where this narrative is heading.<br></p><p>And that’s really my only <em>major </em>complaint about <em>Fallen Aces</em>: I want more of it! That’s a good problem to have, but it’s something to keep in mind when purchasing the game. The developers promise more missions and episodes are coming, and publisher New Blood has a fantastic track record for supporting and expanding its games long after release, so I’m not worried th<em>at Fallen Aces</em> will never receive another episode. I just felt it fair to note for those looking for a meatier and more complete experience.<br></p><p><em>Fallen Aces</em> is a noir-themed sneaky beat’em up that combines retro gameplay, 2D comic book visuals, large levels, and great melee combat into a fantastic package that, while some might find a bit short, is still worth playing and replaying. </p><p>&nbsp;.<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The upcoming books in question — the Dungeon Master’s Guide, the Player’s Handbook, and the Monster Manual — are now available for preorder at Amazon. They cost $49.99 each, and will <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dungeons-dragons-announces-updated-core-rulebook-release-dates-but-not-all-of-them-arrive-in-2024">release</a> between September 2024 and February 2025. These books bring sizable changes to the tabletop game known as One D&amp;D. New editions of the standard accessories are also available for preorder. Read on for details.</p><h2>Preorder New D&amp;D Revised Core Rulebooks</h2><div><div id="202161"><p><h3>Player’s Handbook Core Rulebook (Dungeons &amp; Dragons 2024)</h3></p></div><div id="202162"><p><h3>Dungeon Master’s Guide Core Rulebook (Dungeons &amp; Dragons 2024)</h3></p></div><div id="202163"><p><h3>Monster Manual Core Rulebook (Dungeons &amp; Dragons 2024)</h3></p></div></div><p>All three of the core rulebooks are getting new editions. However, you’ll notice that they’re not all rolling out at the same time. This is due to printing limitations, but they’re coming out as close together as possible.</p><h2>Preorder New D&amp;D Accessories</h2><div><div id="202164"><p><h3>Dungeon Master's Screen (Dungeons &amp; Dragons 2024)</h3></p></div><div id="202165"><p><h3>Character Sheets (Dungeons &amp; Dragons 2024)</h3></p></div></div><p>In addition to the newly revised 5E rulebooks, you can preorder a new Dungeon Master’s screen and new Character Sheets.</p><p>So what’s new in these revised rulebooks? For starters, the Player’s Handbook will actually teach new players how to play D&amp;D. In addition to offering up a list of the rules, as the previous edition did, it has a new section with advice about how to organize and run a game session. Also, all 12 character classes now have four subclasses each, bringing a grand total of 48 subclasses. There’s also a bigger focus on non-combat abilities for the characters. </p><p>Similar tweaks, additions, and assistance for new players are coming to the Dungeon Master’s Guide and Monster Manual.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/in-what-order-should-you-read-the-isaac-asimov-foundation-series/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=in-what-order-should-you-read-the-isaac-asimov-foundation-series<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="310" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Isaac Asimov’s seminal work on the <em>Foundation</em> series spans 40 years of his life and seven books, changing the face <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/10-best-sci-fi-books-of-all-time/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">of science fiction</a> forever. However, the <em>Foundation</em> books move forward and backward in time, not to mention spanning galaxies, so knowing which order to read them can be a little confusing.</p> <h2 id="h-the-right-order-to-read-the-foundation-series" data-injectable="false">The right order to read The Foundation Series</h2> <p data-characters="341" data-current-count="341" data-injectable="false">Now, like any list, this is subjective, and there are many differing opinions on which is the correct order to tackle the <a href="https://geni.us/m0qyhep" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow"><em>Foundation</em> series</a>. However, I have read them all, some of them a few times, and I consider myself familiar with the universe. This is how I think you should go about it, combined with my further rabbit hole of research.</p> <h3 id="h-1-foundation" data-injectable="false"><a href="https://geni.us/5DD2CVA" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">#1 Foundation</a></h3> <p data-characters="268" data-current-count="609" data-injectable="true">Start at the beginning I say, doing away with the internal chronological order of <em>Foundation</em> and instead starting where Asimov did. The <a href="https://geni.us/5DD2CVA" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">first book</a> is a series of short stories spanning huge areas of time, but it is the, ahem, foundation for everything that is to come.</p>
 <p data-characters="188" data-current-count="188" data-injectable="false">This is a worthy starting point, but due to its format, it often loses many readers. However, it is essential reading for the Foundation series, so stick it out and get ready for the next.</p> <h3 id="h-2-foundation-and-empire" data-injectable="false"><a href="https://geni.us/NIACCuS" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">#2 Foundation and Empire </a></h3> <p data-characters="223" data-current-count="411" data-injectable="true"><a href="https://geni.us/NIACCuS" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow"><em>Foundation and Empire</em></a> is a story in two parts, one leading on from the other a century after the first. It further fleshed out the Foundation universe, giving more content to the ideas Asimov has already started to develop.</p>
 <p data-characters="290" data-current-count="290" data-injectable="false">In a universe where Hari Seldon’s predictions essentially rule the way everything works, witnessing it fail pulls the empire into panic. Without the Seldon Plan to rely on, the people of the Empire are lost. They set out to find the location of the Second Foundation to restore peace.</p> <h3 id="h-3-second-foundation" data-injectable="false"><a href="https://geni.us/hJqiW" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">#3 Second Foundation</a></h3> <p data-characters="263" data-current-count="553" data-injectable="true"><a href="https://geni.us/hJqiW" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">This book</a> leads directly on from the first, addressing the issues raised in the second of the <em>Foundation</em> series both chronologically and by publication. More is learned about the Seldon Plan, and efforts are made by the elusive Second Foundation to restore order.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image: Reddit</figcaption></figure> <h3 id="h-4-robots-series" data-injectable="false"><a href="https://geni.us/NlIp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">#4 Robots Series</a></h3> <p data-characters="316" data-current-count="616" data-injectable="true">Now, this is a point of contention between fans of the Isaac Asimov Foundation series and what order they should be read. Many will put <a href="https://geni.us/NlIp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">this series of books</a> at the beginning, but I feel that placing them in the enormous 29-year gap between <em>Second Foundation</em> and <em>Foundation’s Edge</em> is tactical for a few reasons.</p>
 <p data-characters="415" data-current-count="415" data-injectable="true">The gap in Asimov’s writing leads to both a change in style and tone. By reading his <em>Robot</em> series I feel that the change can be traced nicely, growing with him as a writer. The <em>Robot</em> series is a fantastic collection of books and will explain much more about the history of the universe created by the <em>Foundation</em> books. Although chronologically they come before the <em>Foundation</em> series, I like to read them here.</p>
 <h3 id="h-5-foundation-s-edge" data-injectable="false"><a href="https://geni.us/C7TABta" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">#5 Foundation’s Edge </a></h3> <p data-characters="331" data-current-count="331" data-injectable="false">The reason I place <a href="https://geni.us/C7TABta" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow"><em>Foundation’s Edge</em></a> after the <em>Robot</em> series is due to the cliffhanger it finishes on, prompting you to pick up <em>Foundation and Earth</em> immediately after. This, for me, is the correct order to read the <em>Foundation</em> series, as I expect Asimov didn’t want people to forget too much of this book before the next.</p> <p data-characters="179" data-current-count="510" data-injectable="true">Without giving too much away, the Foundation is, as usual, not alone. There are threats to the Seldon Plan, and huge decisions need to be made to determine the future of humanity.</p>
 <h3 id="h-6-foundation-and-earth" data-injectable="false"><a href="https://geni.us/TfvlN" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">#6 Foundation and Earth</a></h3> <p data-characters="348" data-current-count="348" data-injectable="false"><a href="https://geni.us/TfvlN" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow"><em>Foundation and Earth</em></a> is, chronologically, the final book in the order, bringing together many of the powers and ideas brought to fruition in the previous four books. As a conclusion, it is satisfying and carries the gravitas it needs to round the universe up. Although it is the last book chronologically, it isn’t the last one in the series.</p> <p data-characters="287" data-current-count="635" data-injectable="true">If you’re feeling the empty space of a finished science fiction saga, never fear. Isaac Asimov was a prolific writer who published, according to some, 500 books. Of course, he wasn’t finished with the <em>Foundation</em> series. Like <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/science-fiction-books-like-dune/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Frank Herbert</a>, he couldn’t put his pen down.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image: Reddit</figcaption></figure> <h3 id="h-7-prelude-to-foundation" data-injectable="false"><a href="https://geni.us/YrqDZtt" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">#7 Prelude to Foundation</a></h3> <p data-characters="325" data-current-count="625" data-injectable="true">These next two books are set chronologically <a href="https://geni.us/YrqDZtt" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">before the events of <em>The Foundation</em></a>. It follows the steps of Seldon himself as he proposes his paper on the Seldon Plan. This principle allows him to accurately predict the future for generations to come, laying out the framework for everything the future of humanity is based on.</p>
 <h3 id="h-8-forward-the-foundation" data-injectable="false"><a href="https://geni.us/rFKANP" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">#8 Forward the Foundation</a></h3> <p data-characters="233" data-current-count="233" data-injectable="false"><a href="https://geni.us/rFKANP" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">This final book </a>sees the execution of the Seldon Plan in practice, setting up the previous novels. However, Seldon is disenfranchised with the way things are being run using his calculations, and so decides to do something about it. </p> <p data-characters="469" data-current-count="702" data-injectable="false">Although these books are chronologically first in order, I feel that they are the perfect ending to <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/best-science-fiction-book-series-of-all-time-ranked/(opens%20in%20a%20new%20tab)" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the science fiction saga</a> Asimov made with the <em>Foundation</em> series. There are callbacks to characters from the previous books and references to the principles and organisations that we have gotten to know so well. Finally, understanding the origins of so many of the elements in the <em>Foundation</em> series fleshes the books out and leaves a completed feeling to the whole saga.</p>

            <p>
Throne and Liberty - the latest South Korean free-to-play fantasy MMO to land on Amazon Games' publishing slate following 2022's Lost Ark - will get worldwide release on 17th September, with an open beta coming to PC and consoles in July.
</p>
<p>
Developed by NCSoft, the company behind Guild Wars and City of Heroes, Throne and Liberty promises to be a game of exploration and "massive-scale combat" - accommodating "thousands of players at once" - all unfolding in the "dynamic" open world of Solisium.
</p>
<p>
"Adapt your fight to survive and thrive through strategic decisions in PvP, PvE or both as you encounter evolving battlefields impacted by weather, time of day, and other players", its promotion blurb explains. "There is no single path to victory as you seek to defeat Kazar and claim the throne while keeping rival guilds at bay."

<p>
Throne and Liberty's road to release begins this summer, with an open beta running 18th-23rd July in Europe, North and South America, Australia, New Zealand, and Japan. To participate, simply download the Open Beta Test client for Steam, Xbox Series X/S, or PlayStation 5 once the beta - an "opportunity to share feedback and shape the future" - gets underway.
</p>
<p>
After that, the next big date for Throne and Liberty's calendar is 17th September, when the MMO gets its full free-to-play launch across the same platforms (all supporting cross-play) and regions. A few additional details can be found on <a href="https://www.playthroneandliberty.com/en-gb">the Throne and Liberty website</a>.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/smile-2-is-making-good-on-the-original%E2%80%99s-viral-marketing-gimmick.905283/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24181195/smile-2-trailer-release-date-cast-sequel-concert<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="RojoXL">The first <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/23368190/smile-review-horror-movie"><em>Smile </em>was a pretty good horror movie</a> and a pretty massive hit. While those two facts are closely related, at least part of the movie’s cultural impact was thanks to its incredible marketing campaign where people showed up to high-profile events like sports games sporting the series’ trademark unnatural grin. It didn’t have much to do with the movie, but it was undeniably effective. Thankfully, the first trailer for <em>Smile 2</em>, the series’ big-budget sequel, is here to make good on the original’s marketing stunt.</p>
<p id="ZqdMp4"><em>Smile </em>relied mostly on intimate, small-scale scares and the creepy idea that the person you’re talking to could be infected by the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23409413/smile-monster-practical-effect-movie-ending-interview">Smile curse</a> without you even knowing it. The main character, Rose (Sosie Bacon), watched the curse spread through the various members of her life until she <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23378979/smile-2022-horror-about-mental-illness">finally understood what was causing it</a>. </p>
<p id="zMbG7w">But the marketing campaign got at something much big and more sinister. Having normal(ish) people sitting at baseball games and grinning for the camera, implied something massive, an unknowable infection of sporadic unexplainable violence accompanied with an ear to ear smile and wide vacant eyes. Thankfully, this is the deep well that the new movie seems to be tapping into. </p>
<div id="rGhMzQ">
<blockquote data-dnt="true">
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">Here’s some fun, clever movie promo - Paramount seemingly placed <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Smile?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Smile</a> actors in the crowd at both the Yankees and Mets games last night, both in view of cameras. The results were indeed creepy. Going to a game this weekend? Watch out for the smiles!   <a href="https://t.co/aC3sqZjWvI">pic.twitter.com/aC3sqZjWvI</a></p>— Erik Davis (@ErikDavis) <a href="https://twitter.com/ErikDavis/status/1573670514110889986?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 24, 2022</a>
</blockquote>


</div>
<p id="AmpdMQ">The trailer for the new movie primarily follows pop star Skye Riley (Naomi Scott), who seems to be in the middle of a massive nation-wide stadium tour — <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24134076/trap-trailer-thriller-release-date-m-night-shyamalan-pop-star">a popular venue for horror movies this year</a>. Of course, smiles start to creep through the crowd and her fans without any explanation, and violence follows. </p>
<p id="AVAP4T">It all looks far bigger and more expensive, but with the same <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23178743/smile-horror-movie-trailer-release-date-cast">methodical slow-paced scares that made the first movie so effective</a>. And, even more importantly, adding in throngs of people makes the series’ signature grins even more terrifying, making the cursed victims stand out in the crowd, exactly like they did at the baseball games from the original promotions. </p>
<p id="RCZgya"><em>Smile 2</em> is written and directed by <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23374118/smile-ending-meaning-director-interview">Parker Finn</a>, just like the original movie, and is set for release in theaters on Oct. 18.</p>

The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom, a new top-down adventure starring Zelda (finally!), is set to release on September 26. To commemorate the new Zelda game, Nintendo is releasing a special-edition Switch Lite on the same day. There's no word yet on when preorders will go live, but we'll make sure to update this article as soon as they do. Price hasn't been revealed either, though last year's Animal Crossing-themed Switch Lite bundle--which is <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fgoto.walmart.com%2Fc%2F1804712%2F565706%2F9383%3Fveh%3Daff%26sourceid%3Dimp_000011112222333344%26u%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FNintendo-Switch-Lite-Timmy-Tommy-s-Aloha-Edition-Animal-Crossing-New-Horizons-Bundle-Full-Game-Download-Included%2F3162541096%26subId1%3Dsubid_value&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fpreorder-legend-of-zelda-nintendo-switch-lite-hyrule-edition-console%2F1100-6524361%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">still in stock at Walmart</a>--retailed for $200.</p><p>We'd expect this to be a hot commodity, so preorders will likely sell out fast. That means you'll need to reserve a unit as soon as possible if you want to have it in your hands while playing Echoes of Wisdom at launch.</p><p>The Hyrule Edition Nintendo Switch Lite is gold with black button and analog sticks. On the back, you'll find the Hylian Crest, while the front is adorned with a tiny Triforce below the right analog stick.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4321008-nintendoswitchlitezelda.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4321008" data-ratio="0.563" data-width="1000" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4321008-nintendoswitchlitezelda.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4321008"></a><figcaption>Nintendo Switch Lite - Hyrule Edition</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4321008-nintendoswitchlitezelda.jpg"></figure><p>Aside from its slick new design, this is a standard Nintendo Switch Lite console. That means you're getting a 5.5-inch LCD touchscreen display, 32GB storage, and a battery that'll run for up to seven hours before needing a recharge. Keep in mind that Switch Lite can't be docked to a TV, though it supports nearly every game that the standard and OLED models play.</p><p>As an added bonus, the Hyrule Edition comes bundled with a 12-month individual <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fshop-links.co%2F1836651782998675137%3Fu1%3Dsubid_value&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fpreorder-legend-of-zelda-nintendo-switch-lite-hyrule-edition-console%2F1100-6524361%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack membership</a>.

Preorders for the new game aren't live yet either, but we'll have a dedicated preorder guide for Echoes of Wisdom when listings start popping up.</p><p>The Hyrule Edition Switch Lite is the second Zelda-themed Switch console. In 2023, Nintendo released a special-edition Switch OLED console in the lead-up to Tears of the Kingdom's launch. The Zelda-themed Switch OLED has gold Joy-Con controls, a gold-accented pattern on the back panel, and a white Switch dock featuring the Triforce. It's worth noting you can pick up the Japanese version of the console--which can be set to English and plays all North American Switch releases (the Switch is region-free)--for $294 at Walmart ($66 off its original $360 list price).

                <p>It has been more than 15 years since the Nintendo Wii got Metroid Prime 3: Corruption, bringing a supposed end to Samus Aran's first-person adventures. However, Metroid Prime 4 was announced in 2017, instantly becoming one of the Nintendo Switch's most anticipated games despite fans only knowing the name and the logo. In the years since, we have heard very little about the game's progress, though it now appears to be on track for a 2025 release again. Here is what we know about Metroid Prime 4 so far.</p><h2 id="Release_date">Release date</h2><p dir="ltr">Nintendo has not revealed a specific release date for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/metroid-prime-4/">Metroid Prime 4</a>, but it has narrowed it down to a release window. At the June 2024 Nintendo Direct, the company <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/metroid-prime-4-beyond-re-revealed-with-impressive-trailer-and-2025-release-date/1100-6524332/" data-ref-id="1100-6524332">showed a new trailer</a> that debuted the new title, Metroid Prime 4: Beyond, and announced it's coming in 2025. Prior to that, Nintendo had simply stating that the game was "in development" during E3 2017 before later offering an apology for the wait back in 2019, and then subsequently missing that window as well.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="What_we_know_so_far">What we know so far</h2><p dir="ltr">In the grand scheme of things, the real answer is "almost nothing," but there are a few things we've come to understand about Metroid Prime 4's development.</p><p dir="ltr">According to reports, Metroid Prime 4's development initially began under Bandai Namco rather than an internal Nintendo studio, but Nintendo was unhappy with the game's quality at the time. It announced early in 2019 that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/metroid-prime-4s-development-restarted-with-retro-/1100-6464593/">development was restarting</a>, this time via Retro Studios, the American studio behind the first three Metroid Prime games. Producer Kensuke Tanabe, who also served in this role on the first three games and Metroid Prime: Hunters, is back, as well. While these developments bode well for the game's final quality, it doesn't give us any indication of when it will be ready to be shown again.</p><p dir="ltr">As for what Metroid Prime 4 will be about, once again we don't have a whole lot to go off of. At the end of Metroid 3: Corruption, Dark Samus and Phazon were both defeated, leaving Samus ready to move on to the next big challenge the universe decides to throw her way.</p><p dir="ltr">And while the latest trailer doesn't tell us much about the story, it did show Samus showing up to a planet that appears to be a warzone between different alien factions. The trailer showed series mainstays like scanning and lock-on targeting for enemies, along with a mysterious villain who appeared to be flanked by two metroids.</p><p dir="ltr">To catch up on the story, be sure to read our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/metroid-prime-4-the-series-story-so-far/1100-6524350/" data-ref-id="1100-6524350">Metroid Prime story primer</a> for all the details on where Samus has been in this series, along with some speculation about where it could go next.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Platforms">Platforms</h2><p dir="ltr">This was one of the few aspects of Metroid Prime 4 that seemed certain in the past, that Metroid Prime 4 was destined to appear on Nintendo Switch. Now that it has a 2025 release date, it is possible that Metroid Prime 4 will be a swan song for the Switch or a cross-generation release between Switch and Nintendo's next console.</p><h2 dir="ltr"

completely unclear if Metroid Prime 4 will feature multiplayer.

While tacked-on multiplayer is becoming less common in today's big-name game releases, right now it seems impossible to rule out.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Preorder_details">Preorder details</h2><p dir="ltr">You cannot currently preorder Metroid Prime 4.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/fantasian-creator-hironobu-sakaguchi-considers-the-rpgs-wider-release-a-blessing/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=fantasian-creator-hironobu-sakaguchi-considers-the-rpgs-wider-release-a-blessing<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="357" data-injectable="true" data-video="true"><em>Final Fantasy </em>creator Hironobu Sakaguchi and his team at Mistwalker, including legendary composer Nobuo Uematsu, combined forces once again to unleash <em>Fantasian </em>on Apple Arcade in two parts in 2021. Naturally, that means the audience was inherently limited, but now that it’s <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/mistwalker-rpg-fantasian-neo-dimension-coming-to-consoles-holiday-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">finally expanding to other platforms</a>, Sakaguchi shared some thoughts.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="410" data-current-count="410" data-injectable="true">In a <a href="https://twitter.com/Fantasian_EN/status/1803095592400474258" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">statement</a> on <em>Fantasian</em>‘s official English social accounts, Sakaguchi started off by saying that he always wanted <em>Fantasian </em>to be an “especially long-standing title,” and he cites that longevity as one of the strengths of digital games. “I developed <em>Fantasian </em>thinking that it could become my final work before retiring, so it has a special place in my heart,” he continued.&nbsp;</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"></figure> <p data-characters="593" data-current-count="893" data-injectable="true">Sakaguchi added that being able to rebuild <em>Fantasian </em>at Square Enix and offer it to a wider audience is “truly a blessing.” Beyond the exploration and turn-based combat, a lot of the appeal of <em>Fantasian </em>comes down to its beautifully bespoke nature. The backgrounds consist of hand-crafted dioramas, over 150 of which were scanned into the game. Sakaguchi closed out his statement with a nod to all this loving, laborious work, saying, “This title is an amalgamation of the souls of the diorama craftsmen, Uematsu compositions, and of course, the game developers.”&nbsp;</p>
 <h2 id="h-the-soul-of-fantasy" data-injectable="false"><strong>The soul of fantasy</strong></h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot via Square Enix</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="376" data-current-count="676" data-injectable="true">Square Enix is helping Sakaguchi and his team revitalize the RPG as <em>Fantasian Neo Dimension</em>. The new version keeps the story and gameplay intact while adding in some additional features, including English and Japanese voiceovers and more difficulty options. It’s currently set for a 2024 release on PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, Nintendo Switch, and PC.</p>
 <p data-characters="217" data-current-count="217" data-injectable="false">As great as exclusives can be, it’s even better when more people have a chance to enjoy a game you’ve worked so hard on over the years. Here’s hoping this is far from Sakaguchi’s final fantasy.</p>

<p data-characters="412" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Vincent D’Onofrio, who portrayed Kingpin/Wilson Fisk in Netflix’s <em>Daredevil</em> and Marvel Studios’ <em>Echo</em>, has shared his thoughts on the complexity of the situation between Marvel Studios and Sony Pictures. D’Onofrio feels unsure at the moment about how and where the future of Wilson Fisk will be and explains that it is due to the interchanging rights of the characters between Sony and Marvel.</p> <p data-characters="247" data-current-count="247" data-injectable="false">The actor shared his thoughts on the situation amid rumors of his involvement in the upcoming Disney+ show called<em> Your Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man</em>. Charlie Cox is already confirmed to be reprising his role as Daredevil in the animated series.</p> <figure data-current-count="547" data-injectable="true"><p> <iframe title="Marvel Studios' Echo | The Legendary Kingpin | Disney+ &amp; Hulu" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zqjE056Dh6U?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure>
 <p data-characters="296" data-current-count="296" data-injectable="false">“I’m going to transparently say this: You know the whole Marvel-Sony thing, right? So there are characters — Marvel characters invented by Marvel, written by Marvel — that are caught in between Marvel and Sony,” explained the actor at the Fan Expo Boston, as reported by <a href="https://comicbook.com/movies/news/daredevil-vincent-donofrio-kingpin-rights-marvel-sony-friendly-neighborhood-spider-man-animated-series/">Comic Book</a>.</p> <p data-characters="242" data-current-count="538" data-injectable="true">Vincent D’Onofrio also added that this setup between the two companies is why “it takes a long time for them to figure out who is doing what.” As for where Kingpin can show up, he said that he never really knows where it may happen.</p>
 <p data-characters="201" data-current-count="201" data-injectable="false">“My character is in that kind of situation, unlike Charlie’s [Charlie Cox]. So I don’t know, it’s part of the deal when it comes to playing Kingpin,” said Vincent D’Onofrio.</p> <p data-characters="269" data-current-count="470" data-injectable="false">While Kingpin has been introduced to the Marvel Cinematic Universe through <em>Hawkeye</em> and <em>Echo</em>, Vincent D’Onofrio’s Kingpin will be in the spotlight once again in the upcoming <em>Daredevil: Born Again</em> show. <em>Daredevil: Born Again</em> is slated for a release in March 2025.</p>
